Families constitute important settings for the nutritional management of older adults, and there is a growing demand for continuous nutritional management services extending from hospital care to home‐based care.
Since the publication of theChinese Expert Consensus on Home Nutrition Administration for the Elderly (2017 Edition)7 years ago, accumulating research evidence and practical experience in home‐based nutritional management has highlighted an urgent need for updating this consensus.
In this revised edition, a total of 35 recommendations and expert consensus statements have been proposed to guide community‐based health professionals in delivering scientifically sound, rational, and standardized home nutritional management services to elderly populations residing at home or within community settings.
Chinese older population aged 60 and above reached 296 million by the end of 2023, with the 65 andabove demographic accounting for 216 million, constituting 15.4% of the total population [1].
Projections suggest that older population aged 60 and above will surpass 400 million by around 2035, representing over 30% of the total population, indicating a transition into a period of severe aging [2].
In Chinese communities, the combined prevalence of malnutrition and malnutrition risk among elderly people is 41.2% [3].
Malnutrition is significantly associated with a myriad of adverse clinical outcomes.
Research indicated that malnutrition was correlated with a 32% increase in the annual average hospitalization rate for older Chinese people, an additional 486 yuan in annual hospitalization costs, and an increase of 45.84 billion yuan in healthcare expenditures in 2015 [4], along with higher readmission rates [5] and a 0.5% rise in mortality [6].
In 2017, the State Council introduced the “National Nutrition Plan 2017–2030” [7], which highlighted “nutrition improvement for older people” as a key initiative.
In 2022, the National Office of Aging issued a directive on “initiating actions to improve nutrition in older people,” [8] emphasizing the importance of enhancing nutritional health awareness among older persons, improving their nutritional status, and elevating the quality of nutritional health services provided by the health system.
Addressing malnutrition in older people necessitatesc robust professional support and an extended management period.
Given the constraints of hospital stays, long‐term nutritional interventions are not possible.
Thus, nutritional support must be extended beyond the hospital setting to homes, communities, and older people's care facilities, which is the essence of the Home Nutrition Administration (HNA).
Data indicated that 71% of patients who received HNA services continued to utilize them in the subsequent year [9], highlighting a substantial demand for HNA services in China.
An ongoing national survey of clinical nutrition departments in medical institutions (encompassing over 400 hospitals) [10] revealed that 37.98% had implemented HNA, 87.97% had developed professional HNA information systems, 94.94% had initiated predischarge home nutrition education, and 64.56% had established proactive postdischarge home nutrition follow‐up programs, demonstrating a steady nationwide expansion of HNA services.
Extensive research evidence indicated that the implementation of HNA services could ameliorate malnutrition without escalating overall healthcare costs [11], significantly reduce complications and mortality rates [12], and decrease both the number of hospitalizations and the duration of hospital stays [13].
The “Chinese Expert Consensus on Home Nutrition Administration for the Elderly (Version 2017)” [14] is now 7 years old, and in light of emerging research evidence and the evolution of home nutrition administration practices, the Nutrition and Food Safety Branch of the Chinese Geriatrics Society has convened a panel of experts to update the consensus.
This updated expert consensus aims to employ evidence‐based medicine methodologies, conduct systematic reviews (SRs) of evidence, and integrate the current state of the HNA in China while soliciting extensive feedback to guide grassroots professionals in delivering scientific, rational, and standardized HNA services to older individuals residing in home and community settings.
This consensus aims to provide scientifically sound evidence on home nutrition administration (HNA) services for older patients in home or community settings.
It applies to individuals aged 65 years and older, encompassing those receiving care in home‐based, community‐based, or institutional settings, as well as older patients following discharge from hospitals.
The primary beneficiaries of this consensus include older adults identified with nutritional risks, malnutrition, or those in need of nutritional consultations related to chronic diseases.
Additionally, this consensus targets health professionals involved in HNA‐related practices, such as dietitians, physicians, nurses, psychotherapists, and rehabilitation therapists and caregivers.
A nationwide survey was conducted to assess the current status of HNA practices within clinical nutrition departments of healthcare institutions across China through electronic questionnaire.
By March 31, 2024, a total of 428 valid questionnaires had been collected, representing 32 provinces and municipalities.
The findings indicated that the five priority clinical conditions involved with HNA were cancer, digestive system diseases, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases.
Building upon the Chinese Expert Consensus on Home Nutrition Administration for the Elderly (2017 Edition) and leveraging findings obtained from this survey, key scientific questions were identified and integrated into the updated consensus, reflecting a prioritization of both clinical and patient needs.
These questions then directed a comprehensive literature search of English (PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the WanFang Database).
The search strategies were showed in TableS1.
The search timeframe for existing issues from the 2017 edition was from January 1, 2016, to March 31, 2024.
For newly identified issues, the search extended from the inception of the databases to March 31, 2024.
In cases where no SRs or meta‐analyses were available but multiple original studies with inconsistent findings were present, or when new research evidence emerged after the publication of SRs, the synthesized evidence was utilized as the research evidence.
Evidence and recommendation grading were conducted using the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine 2011 criteria (TablesS2andS3) [15], prioritizing the highest quality evidence.
The consensus meeting was applied to refine and select the recommendations.
For key scientific questions lacking evidence, expert consensus opinions were generated during the meeting.
The level of expert agreement was quantified by the consensus rate, with a rate of ≥ 70% indicating that a consensus had been achieved.
The methodological framework for this consensus is depicted in Figure1.
This consensus was registered with the International Practice Guideline Registration and Transparency Platform (No. PREPARE‐2024CN509).
Flowchart of evidence retrieval, evaluation, and consensus formation process.
PICOS, participant, intervention, comparison, outcome, study design.
Recommendation 1: The establishment of a multidisciplinary HNA team is recommended.
This team can include dietitians, nurses, physicians, rehabilitation therapists, psychotherapists, and caregivers, to provide comprehensive and professional management.
This approach is likely to enhance the nutritional status and quality of life of older patients, decrease the incidence of complications, and facilitate rapid recovery (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
An SR of eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n= 1142, evidence level: 1) [16] indicated that interventions by dietitians could result in a mean postdischarge weight increase of 2.02 kg (0.23 to 3.81) in older patients.
Collaborative efforts between dietitians and other professionals in home nutrition administration services may yield even better outcomes.
An SR encompassing 15 studies (n= 2145, evidence level: 1) [17] suggested that a multidisciplinary team consisting of clinicians, nurses, dietitians, speech therapists, and caregivers providing comprehensive management for long‐term enteral feeding patients may lead to a significant decrease in average hospital costs per patient (mean difference (MD) = –623.08 USD, 95% confidence interval (CI): –745.64 to –500.53).
A previous RCT (n= 89, evidence level: 2) [18] found that treatment adherence and nutritional status in older patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were improved more following a 6‐month intervention by a home nutrition administration team comprising nephrologists, clinical nutrition physicians, and hemodialysis nurses than by routine nutritional health education.
Another RCT (n= 100, evidence level: 2) [19] found that a home empowerment team consisting of cardiologists, dietitians, cardiovascular nurses, and psychotherapists provided better comprehensive care for older patients with chronic heart failure, with improved nutritional administration capabilities in primary caregivers, better nutritional outcomes, and left ventricular ejection fraction compared to the control group.
These studies underscored the significance of multidisciplinary teams in nutritional administration.
The composition and responsibilities of the HNA Team are summarized in Table1.

Note: Dietitians: refers to nutritionists with relevant qualifications and certifications who can work in clinical nutrition; Nurses: must have received training in nutritional support and have related experience; Rehabilitation therapists: primarily refers to speech therapists responsible for dysphagia assessment and swallowing exercises; Physicians: mainly refers to general practitioners in community settings; Caregivers: include the patient's family members, housemaids, volunteers, and professional home healthcare providers, among others.
Abbreviaions: √, yes; ‐, no; HNA, home nutrition administration; PN, parenteral nutrition; TF, tube feeding.
Recommendation 2: Advancing the nutritional and health knowledge and holistic care skills of the home nutrition administration team through education and training can significantly improve the nutritional status and physical, and social functions of older patients (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
An RCT (n= 200, evidence level: 2) [20] established a nutrition intervention group comprising dietitians, physicians, ward nurses, and community nurses.
Dietitians periodically visited communities or held WeChat video lectures to educate community nurses on nutrition, who then regularly conducted dietary health education sessions for older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
After 3 months of intervention, the experimental group demonstrated superior nutritional indicators, including body mass index (BMI) (26.54 ± 3.90 kg/m2vs. 24.88 ± 4.05 kg/m2), plasma albumin (ALB) levels (43.67 ± 4.69 g/L vs. 39.67 ± 3.29 g/L), and Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (2.06 ± 0.54 vs. 3.09 ± 0.38), and improved pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity; 71.32% ± 9.39% vs. 61.03% ± 10.63%) and quality of life (COPD assessment test) scores (38.64 ± 5.79 vs. 31.34 ± 5.29) compared to the conventional nutritional education group (p< 0.05).
Another RCT focusing on older patients with chronic heart failure (n= 100, evidence level: 2) [19] found that a home empowerment team consisting of cardiologists, dietitians, cardiovascular nurses, and psychotherapists, which provided training to caregivers, enhanced their nutritional administration capabilities (nutrition knowledge score (13.89 ± 2.01 vs. 12.13 ± 2.25), nutrition attitude score (15.31 ± 2.26 vs. 13.89 ± 2.01), nutrition behavior score (29.57 ± 2.43 vs. 26.72 ± 3.01)).
The experimental group utilizing the home empowerment program exhibited improved nutritional status and left ventricular ejection fraction after the intervention.
A separate RCT (n= 86, evidence level: 2) [21] of older patients postesophageal cancer surgery reported that the experimental group, which employed shared decision‐making for home nutrition with caregivers, including nutritional education and skill training with telephone follow‐up guidance, showed better prealbumin outcomes (238.73 ± 1.70 mg/L vs. 195.63 ± 1.59 mg/L), ALB (44.83 ± 1.32 g/L vs. 39.64 ± 2.54 g/L), hemoglobin (Hb) levels (133.67 ± 1.78 g/L vs. 126.53 ± 2.04 g/L), role function (Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ‐C30), 59.67 ± 4.82 vs. 55.74 ± 4.27), physical function (QLQ‐C30, 79.45 ± 7.81 vs. 73.64 ± 7.13), and social function (QLQ‐C30, 56.19 ± 5.96 vs. 53.18 ± 5.07) compared to the control group who received standard nutritional support.
Additionally, the experimental group had a lower total incidence of complications (4.55%) compared to the control group (19.05%).
Recommendation 3: Incorporating digital health technology into the home nutrition administration of older patients can enhance their compliance, nutritional status, and the efficacy of chronic disease management (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: A, consensus rate: 100%).
The World Health Organization in the Global Strategy on Digital Health (2020–2025) [22] and the International Digital Therapeutics Alliance [23] define digital therapeutics as software‐driven, evidence‐based interventions that prevent, treat, or manage diseases, thereby improving patient outcomes.
Digital health includes telemedicine, digital monitoring, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics, and digital rehabilitation, and can be utilized independently or in conjunction with pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical interventions.
Digital health has demonstrated safety and efficacy among older people with malnutrition, hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions.
An SR (evidence level: 1) [24] indicated that telemedicine interventions, including dietary counseling, could assist community‐dwelling older individuals in increasing their daily protein intake by 0.13 g/kg (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.25;I2= 41%) and enhancing their quality of life (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.99;I2= 84%).
Another SR encompassing 18 studies (n= 2965, evidence level: 1) [25] found that app‐based mobile health interventions were effective in reducing systolic (MD = 8.12 mmHg, 95% CI: 11.47 to 4.77) and diastolic blood pressure (MD = 6.67 mmHg, 95% CI: 8.92 to 4.41) in Chinese patients with hypertension.
Within this, four studies (n= 539) documented the positive influence of mobile health on blood pressure control rates (risk ratio = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.49;I2= 0%).
An SR of 16 RCTs (n= 6204, evidence level: 1) [26] found that glycated Hb levels were reduced by 0.24% (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.05;I2= 85%), postprandial blood glucose levels were decreased by 2.91 mmol/L (95% CI: –4.78 to –1.03), and triglyceride levels were decreased by 0.09 mmol/L (95% CI: –0.17 to –0.02;p= 0.010) in older patients with diabetes who received mobile nutritional telemedicine interventions.
An SR of 18 RCTs (n= 8274, evidence level: 1) [27] reported that telemedicine significantly improved biomedical outcomes, such as blood glucose and cholesterol levels, in patients with diabetes over the age of 50.
The frequency and self‐efficacy of blood glucose self‐monitoring are behavioral outcomes that have increased with the use of telemedicine.
Telemedicine also positively impacts psychosocial outcomes, including depression, quality of life, cognitive decline, and social support.
A non‐RCT (n= 228, evidence level: 4) [28] suggested that remote chronic kidney disease (CKD) management could enhance compliance with renal clinic visits, provide care for rural CKD patients, and bridge the gap between urban and rural patient care.
Thus, considering the digital literacy levels of older people, adapting digital health solutions for aging populations, and continuously training older patients to proficiently use smart devices are essential [26].
Recommendation 4: Performing routine nutritional screenings is essential, given the high prevalence of malnutrition risk and malnutrition among older individuals in communities and long‐term care facilities (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
A meta‐analysis of older people's community dwellers in China in 2022 (n= 47,508, evidence level: 2) [29], encompassing 47 observational studies, reported a malnutrition risk rate of 36.6% (95% CI: 30.4% to 42.8%).
Additionally, the same year, another meta‐analysis that included 13 cross‐sectional studies (n= 19,938, evidence level: 2) [3] indicated that among Chinese community‐dwelling older people aged 60 and above, the pooled prevalence of malnutrition or risk of malnutrition was 41.2% (95% CI: 29.5% to 54.0%,p< 0.05;I2= 99.6%).
An SR conducted in 2021 included 36 observational studies (n= 34,607, evidence level: 2) [30], 32 of which utilized the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) or MNA short‐form (MNA‐SF) tools for nutritional evaluation in 11,993 individuals.
The study examined the nutritional status of older residents in long‐term care facilities over the past half‐decade and found a malnutrition or malnutrition risk prevalence of 60.4%.
Thus, community‐dwelling elderly nutritional screening should be included in their annual health check‐ups, and the residents of long‐term care facilities should undergo nutritional screening on a quarterly basis.
Recommendation 5: Older patients are at an increased nutritional risk at the time of discharge compared to admission; hence, performing nutritional screening within 24 h prior to discharge is essential (evidence level: 3, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
A nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study (n= 6638, evidence level: 3) [31] reported that the prevalence of nutritional risk and malnutrition among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over was higher at discharge than at admission (51.41% vs. 53.04%, 32.98% vs. 35.59%, respectively,p< 0.001).
These findings indicate that the nutritional risk and status of older patients at discharge are concerning and warrant attention.
Recommendation 6: Focus should be placed on nutritional screening for women, individuals over the age of 80, rural residents, those living alone, older people with chronic diseases, compromised daily activity abilities, cognitive dysfunction, and frailty (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
A meta‐analysis of 47 observational studies (n= 47,508, evidence level: 2) [29] reported that nutritional risk was detected in 36.6% of the older people's Chinese community population (95% CI: 30.4% to 42.8%), with higher detection rates observed in women (44.6%), people over 80 (46.8%), those with lower levels of education (54.8%), people living alone (49.5%), with chronic diseases (39.0%), residing in rural areas (51.8%), in the central China region (56.7%), with compromised daily activity abilities (70.6%), cognitive dysfunction (62.6%), and frail individuals (52.6%).
Another meta‐analysis that included 13 cross‐sectional studies (n= 19,938, evidence level: 2) [3] showed that the combined prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk in the older Chinese community population was 41.2% (95% CI: 29.5% to 54.0%,p< 0.05;I2= 99.6%), with notably higher malnutrition rates in women (52.2%) and older individuals living alone (49.6%).
Recommendation 7: Utilize the MNA‐SF for the nutritional screening of older populations upon discharge, within community homes, and in older people's care institutions (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
A prospective cohort study (n= 3041, evidence level: 2) [32] determined that the risk of malnutrition identified by MNA‐SF screening (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.71,p< 0.001) was correlated with an increased risk of mortality among older people residing in homes or institutions in Stockholm, Sweden's Kungsholmen district.
Another prospective cohort study (n= 2075, evidence level: 2) [33] established that the risk of malnutrition identified by MNA‐SF screening was linked to an increased risk of disability (OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.13 to 9.16,p= 0.029), poor quality of life measured using the Medical Outcomes Study SF12 Physical (OR = 4.53, 95% CI: 2.13 to 9.64,p< 0.001), and mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 4.76, 95% CI: 2.82 to 8.03,p< 0.001) among community‐dwelling older adults in Singapore's southeastern region.
A third prospective cohort study (n= 1033, evidence level: 2) [34] identified Charlson Comorbidity Index and MNA‐SF scores as independent predictors of 5‐year all‐cause mortality in community‐dwelling older people undergoing health assessments at a specific hospital.
A fourth prospective cohort study (n= 333, evidence level: 2) [35] found that the risk of all‐cause mortality over 4 years was significantly higher among older individuals in veterans' nursing homes identified as being at risk of malnutrition by MNA‐SF screening (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.04 to 4.01,p= 0.037).
A fifth prospective cohort study (n= 157, evidence level: 2) [36] determined that MNA‐SF scores significantly predicted 30‐month mortality among older residents in five Japanese nursing homes (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.97,p= 0.005).
A retrospective cohort study of older individuals in Polish nursing homes (n= 96, evidence level: 3) [37] found that those identified as being at risk of malnutrition by MNA‐SF screening had an increased risk of death (HR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.89 to 8.09).
A cross‐sectional survey study of older people in rural Vietnam (n= 627, evidence level: 4) [38] revealed that the eight dimensions of health‐related quality of life (Short‐Form 36 questionnaire) were positively correlated with MNA‐SF scores, and the risk of malnutrition identified by MNA‐SF screening (OR = 4.78, 95% CI: 1.86 to 12.32) was associated with a higher risk of frailty.
A cross‐sectional study of older residents in four nursing homes in Uppsala, central Sweden (n= 172, evidence level: 4) [39] found that a decrease in MNA‐SF scores was associated with declines in activity and cognitive function in older people (p< 0.01).
In conclusion, the risk of malnutrition identified by MNA screening was associated with mortality, activity, quality of life, cognitive function, and frailty among community/home/nursing home older individuals, and the MNA‐SF is recommended for the nutritional screening of community/home/nursing home older individuals.
Recommendation 8: Older individuals identified as being at nutritional risk or requiring chronic disease nutrition counseling should undergo a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment that includes clinical history, dietary status, anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests, physical function, and social activity (expert opinion, consensus rate: 100%).
Further nutritional assessment should be conducted for older individuals who are identified through screening as being at nutritional risk or requiring chronic disease nutrition counseling.
Providing appropriate nutritional support based on the assessment results is important for improving adverse clinical outcomes in older people.
An SR of nine RCTs [16] found that the MNA could predict mortality in older people's communities (n= 5814, relative risk (RR) = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.87) and long‐term care facility residents (n= 2363, RR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.32 to 6.56), making it suitable for home nutrition administration.
Nutritional assessment is a multidimensional and comprehensive process that requires the consideration of various factors.
Comprehensive nutritional assessment indicators are often advocated in clinical practice to improve sensitivity and specificity [40].
Thus, dietitians should assess the nutritional needs of the target population by understanding their dietary history, medical history, clinical condition, anthropometric data, laboratory results, daily function, and socioeconomic information.
In addition to assessing indicators related to malnutrition, multiple comprehensive factors that affect the development of malnutrition should also be included, such as common geriatric physical function status, mental and psychological status, frailty, and sarcopenia assessments [41], to individualize treatment plans (Table2).
Comprehensive nutritional assessment content for older population in China.
Physical examination: muscle fat loss, edema, skin, hair, oral cavity, teeth, vision, muscle strength, neural reflexes, trauma, etc.
Abbreviaions: ADL, activity of daily living; EAT‐10, eating assessment tool; MNA, mini‐nutritional assessment; NR, not reported; SARC‐F, the simple five item scoring scale for sarcopenia.
Comprehensive nutritional assessment requires multidisciplinary team members to jointly analyze the information obtained from the assessment.
A comprehensive and accurate analysis helps to provide personalized and effective nutritional interventions and monitoring [36].
Nutritional screening for community and home‐based older individuals is recommended at least once every 12 months, and further nutritional assessment should be conducted if malnutrition or nutritional risk is identified through screening [40].
During the nutritional intervention process, nutritional status should be reassessed regularly, and interventions should be adjusted accordingly.
Nutritional risk screening and nutritional status assessment for older individuals in the community can be conducted by staff who are easily able to implement it according to the actual situation.
In community health service centers, nurses can perform early nutritional screening, and community medical staff or general practitioners with basic nutrition skills and knowledge can conduct nutritional risk screening and nutritional status assessment.
In older people's care institutions, the nurses and physicians there can implement it.
Regular outpatient follow‐up patients can be the responsibility of outpatient physicians/nutritionists.
Older people who live far from community health service centers can be screened by telephone.
All medical personnel engaged in community/home nutritional risk screening and nutritional status assessment should receive systematic and standardized training to become familiar with and master the operational steps and precautions of nutritional risk screening and nutritional status assessment.
Currently, research and practical experience regarding home parenteral nutrition in China remain limited.
Consequently, this consensus statement does not address content related to home parenteral nutrition.
The recommended nutritional interventions presented herein focus exclusively on home nutrition education, elder‐friendly diets, and home enteral nutrition therapy.
Recommendation 9: Nutrition education can enhance the nutritional status and health level of community‐dwelling older individuals (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
In China, community older individuals tend to have less dietary nutrition knowledge than middle‐aged and younger adults [42,43,44], and the growth in awareness of nutrition related to chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases, is slow [45].
An SR and meta‐analysis including 70 RCT studies (n= 18,567, evidence level: 1) [46] demonstrated that nutrition education delivered through electronic health applications and various health interventions could effectively improve body composition and clinical outcomes among older people (weight: MD = –2.31 kg, 95% CI: –2.78 to –1.84,p< 0.001; BMI: MD = –0.68 kg/m2, 95% CI: –0.98 to –0.39,p< 0.001; waist circumference: MD = –2.04 cm, 95% CI: –3.24 to –0.84,p< 0.001; low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) level: MD = –4.41  mg/dL, 95% CI: –4.52 to –4.29,p< 0.001; systolic blood pressure: MD = –1.67 mmHg, 95% CI: –1.77 to –1.56,p< 0.001; glycated Hb: MD = –2.12%, 95% CI: –3.01 to –1.23,p< 0.001).
An SR of 31 original studies, including 10 RCTs and 21 nonrandomized studies (n= 6634, evidence level: 1) [47], indicated that diverse nutrition education approaches were beneficial for improving the nutritional status of older people, with the most promising results coming from group‐based nutrition education combined with behavioral change theory.
An RCT (n= 60, evidence level: 2) [48] revealed that healthy lifestyle education, including specialized nutrition education developed by nutrition researchers centered on a family empowerment model, significantly improved the total lifestyle scores of older people (Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP2) scale (2 months): MD = 13.7 points, 95% CI: 5.6 to 21.8,p< 0.05; HPLP2 scale (6 months): MD = 17.2 points, 95% CI: 7.7 to 26.7,p< 0.001).
A cluster‐RCT (n= 720, evidence level: 2) [49] demonstrated that nutrition education grounded in social cognitive theory could effectively enhance the dietary diversity (OR = 7.75, 95% CI: 5.012 to 11.973,p< 0.001) and nutritional status (β = 1.119,p< 0.001) of older people in a convenient, feasible, and cost‐effective manner.
Another RCT (n= 85, evidence level: 2) [50] showed that peer education or the self‐participation of older people in nutrition education improved their nutritional status and enhanced their action‐related quality of life (15D validated questionnaire; protein intake (intervention group) = 0.10 g/(adjusted body weight (ABW) kg·d), 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.19; protein intake (control group) = –0.07 g/(ABW kg·d), 95% CI: –0.15 to 0.01,p= 0.024).
Recommendation 10: Home‐based nutrition education for diabetic patients can lead to improved glycated Hb levels (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: A, consensus rate: 100%).
In a scoping review encompassing 44 original studies (n= 63,230, evidence level: 1) [51], 13 reported on the impact of diabetes self‐nutrition management education on diabetes knowledge, with 11 studies demonstrating that nutrition education effectively enhanced the knowledge levels of older patients.
Out of 21 studies, 19 indicated that self‐nutrition management education for older patients with diabetes positively influenced self‐management behaviors.
Among 16 studies, 11 noted significant reductions in glycated Hb (HbA1c) levels.
Another SR including 553 RCTs (n= 412,161, evidence level: 1) [52] showed that nutrition education significantly reduced HbA1c levels in patients with baseline HbA1c levels > 8.3% (MD = –0.17%, 95% CI: –0.30 to –0.05).
Furthermore, when patient nutrition education was combined with other interventions, such as promoting patient self‐management and follow‐up reminders, it facilitated improvements in glycemic control for patients with baseline HbA1c levels ≤ 8.3% (MD = –0.41%, 95% CI: –0.61 to –0.22) [50].
A separate SR of 18 RCTs (n= 6602, evidence level: 1) [51] found that individual home nutrition education had the most pronounced effect on reducing HbA1c levels, with a reduction of 1.6% (p< 0.001) [53].
Recommendation 11: Nutrition education for older patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases may enhance nutritional cognitive levels and decrease blood pressure, LDL, and BMI (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
An RCT of older patients with coronary heart disease (n= 68, evidence level: 2) [54] found that the intervention group experienced significant reductions in LDL levels (MD = –2.26 mmol/L, 95% CI: –3.97 to –0.55,p< 0.05) and BMI (MD = –2.96 kg/m2, 95% CI: –4.65 to –1.27,p< 0.05) after 12 weeks of nutrition education compared to the control group, which only received routine health education, and their nutritional cognition questionnaire scores (MD = 7.88 points, 95% CI: 3.17 to 12.59,p< 0.05) were significantly improved.
An RCT of older patients with hypertension (n= 100, evidence level: 2) [55] found that the intervention group had significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (MD = –4.70 mmHg, 95% CI: –8.95 to –0.45,p< 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (MD = –3.30 mmHg, 95% CI: –5.24 to –1.36,p< 0.05) following nutrition education.
Recommendation 12: Nutrition education can enhance the nutritional status of older cancer patients, mitigate radiotherapy‐related complications, and improve the quality of life (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%), as well as increase the success rate of postdischarge home‐based rehabilitation (evidence level: 3, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
An RCT (n= 468, evidence level: 2) [56] demonstrated that personalized nutrition education could ameliorate the nutritional status of radiotherapy patients, with lower subjective global assessment scores in the education group (MD = –1.3 points, 95% CI: –2.0 to –6.0,p< 0.0001) and a reduced incidence of malnutrition (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.8,p= 0.004).
A retrospective cohort study of older cancer patients requiring surgery (n= 153, evidence level: 3) [57] indicated that nutrition education improved the patients' nutritional status, with esophageal cancer patients who received preoperative nutrition education 1.8 times more likely to be able to consume food orally postoperatively (50.5% vs. 28.8%,p= 0.010) and 1.5 times more likely to successfully rehabilitate at home after discharge (55.4% vs. 36.5%,p= 0.027).
An RCT (n= 84, evidence level: 2) [58] suggested that goal‐attainment theory‐based perioperative nutrition education improved postoperative nutritional status in patients with colorectal cancer, with higher prealbumin levels 7 days postoperatively in the education group (200.25 ± 53.25 mg/L vs. 165.73 ± 43.00 mg/L,p= 0.002).
Goal‐attainment theory‐based perioperative nutrition education also increased patient compliance with oral nutritional supplements (ONS) and the rate of achieving oral nutritional intake targets, with statistically significant differences in compliance scores between the education group and the control group at 7 days (25.16 ± 5.34 vs. 19.11 ± 4.86), 14 days (25.95 ± 4.8 vs. 20.57 ± 4.37), and 21 days (88.1% vs. 66.7%).
Another RCT (n= 144, evidence level: 2) [59] also showed that nutrition education improved treatment compliance in patients with gastric cancer (73.61% vs. 55.56%,p= 0.024).
An RCT (n= 96, evidence level: 2) [60] showed that comprehensive nutrition management, including nutrition education, improved the nutritional status of older esophageal cancer patients, with statistically significant differences in changes in serum ALB (–1.64 ± 3.201 g/L vs. –4.10 ± 2.993 g/L) and total protein levels (–0.72 ± 7.740 g/L vs. –3.68 ± 3.402 g/L) between the nutrition management group and the control group.
Additionally, the incidence of radiation esophagitis (20.2% vs. 42.5%,p= 0.029) and radiation dermatitis (28.9% vs. 55.0%,p= 0.015) was lower in the intervention group than in the control group.
Using the QLQ‐C30 scale to compare the initial and final scores of the two groups, statistically significant differences were found in changes in physical function (–1.18 ± 5.169 vs. –5.63 ± 6.835,p< 0.001), social function (–1.85 ± 8.119 vs. –6.67 ± 8.268,p= 0.008), nausea and vomiting (–1.11 ± 4.250 vs. 3.33 ± 6.752,p< 0.001), pain (–1.48 ± 4.798 vs. 2.92 ± 9.157,p< 0.001), and loss of appetite (2.22 ± 8.409 vs. 8.34 ± 14.629,p= 0.023), indicating that comprehensive nutrition management could also improve patients' quality of life.
An RCT involving patients with colon or rectal cancer (n= 111, evidence level: 2) [61] randomly assigned patients to three groups: group 1 (n= 37) received nutritional counseling and education, group 2 (n= 37) used dietary supplements and consumed regular food, and group 3 consumed a normal diet.
Neither group 2 nor group 3 received personalized nutritional counseling and education.
The study results showed that nutritional education allowed most patients to maintain their nutritional status during radiotherapy (91% vs. 7% vs. 0%,p< 0.01) and maintain energy and protein intake equivalent to the reference intake.
Follow‐up of the three groups found that nutritional education reduced mortality (8% vs. 22% vs. 30%,p< 0.01) and late radiotherapy toxicity (9% vs. 59% vs. 65%,p= 0.02).
Recommendation 13: Nutrition education may lead to an increase in energy intake, improved dietary structure, and enhanced quality of life for patients with COPD (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 94.12%).
An RCT (n= 22, evidence level: 2) [62] assigned male outpatients with COPD over 60 to either a nutrition education group or a control group.
Nutrition education was provided through face‐to‐face and telephone consultations to regulate dietary behaviors, with family members playing a supervisory role.
After 15 weeks of nutrition education, the energy intake of the education group increased from the initial level, whereas it decreased in the control group (376 kcal/d vs. –50 kcal/d,p= 0.03), with a statistically significant difference.
A significant difference in the dietary appropriateness score between the nutrition education group and the control group was seen (4 vs 0), indicating that nutrition education improved patients' dietary structure.
Among the dietary behavior items, the change in “consumption behavior of fresh seasonal ingredients” was statistically significant (0.0 vs. –0.5,p= 0.04).
Another RCT (n= 200, evidence level: 2) [63] delivered nutrition education for COPD patients over a 6‐month period.
The difference in SF‐36 questionnaire scores between the end and the beginning of the study was compared, revealing significant improvements in social function (9.1 ± 7.6 vs. 0.3 ± 1.0,p= 0.01), emotional role function (6.6 ± 5.3 vs. –3.8 ± 1.1,p= 0.04), mental health (7.3 ± 3.5 vs. –1.3 ± 4.4,p= 0.02), and health changes over the past year (9.7 ± 2.5 vs. 1.1 ± 5.1,p= 0.01), suggesting that nutrition education contributes to enhancing patients' quality of life.
Recommendation 14: Nutrition education can improve BMI, muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle function in older patients with sarcopenia (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
An SR of 10 interventional studies (n= 1188, evidence level: 1) [64] indicated that the effectiveness of nutrition education on improving skeletal muscle mass, 5‐time sit‐to‐stand time, and the stand‐walk test in older Japanese individuals with sarcopenia and frailty was unclear.
An RCT (n= 114, evidence level: 2) [65] provided health education focusing on a balanced diet and exercise guidance for older individuals with sarcopenia and showed significant increases in BMI (before 19.49 ± 2.61 kg/m2vs. after 19.96 ± 2.45 kg/m2,p< 0.05) and walking speed (before 0.76 ± 0.14 m/s vs. after 0.78 ± 0.14 m/s,p< 0.05) after the intervention.
Another RCT (n= 60, evidence level: 2) [66] offered personalized health education for older individuals with sarcopenia, resulting in significant improvements in grip strength (before 24.8 ± 7.2 kg vs. after 26.3 ± 6.8 kg,p< 0.05) and walking speed (before 1.1 ± 0.2 m/s vs. after 1.3 ± 0.2 m/s,p< 0.05).
An RCT (n= 201, evidence level: 2) [67] providing nutritional management information to older adults with sarcopenia via a mobile phone app that assessed each participant's diet and recommended adjustments showed a significant increase in skeletal muscle mass (before 13.88 ± 2.39 kg vs. after 15.52 ± 2.39 kg,p< 0.001) in older persons receiving nutritional management information from the app compared to the control group.
Recommendation 15: Nutrition education can enhance dietary calcium intake and bone density in patients with osteoporosis (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
Educating older individuals with osteoporosis about nutrition can increase their understanding of nutrition related to their condition.
In an RCT (n= 90, evidence level: 2) [68] of osteoporotic patients provided with nutrition education in addition to pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, significant improvements were seen in the intervention group, which received educational materials, presentations, and weekly one‐on‐one dietary guidance for 6 months The intervention group had higher dietary calcium intake (MD = 185.40 mg, 95% CI: 142.28 to 228.52,p< 0.05), protein intake (MD = 14.50 g, 95% CI: 11.14 to 17.86,p< 0.05), lumbar spine bone density (MD = 0.05 g/cm2, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.09,p< 0.05), and femoral neck bone density (MD = 0.05 g/cm2, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.10,p< 0.05) compared to the control group.
These results indicate that nutrition education can play a pivotal role in enhancing dietary calcium intake and the overall bone health of older patients with osteoporosis.
Recommendation 16: Opting for a low glycemic index (GI) /low glycemic load (GL) diet under the guidance of dietitians may help older patients with diabetes reduce HbA1c levels; choosing a high‐protein diet helps to lower low‐density lipoprotein, cholesterol, and triglycerides (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
TheDietary Guide for Adults with Diabetes(2023 Edition) explicitly recommends that older patients with diabetes should have a fixed amount of staple food, not excessive amounts.
It recommends prioritizing whole grains and foods with a low GI [69].
A meta‐analysis of 29 RCT studies (n= 1617, evidence level: 1) [70] demonstrated that a low GI/GL diet significantly lowered HbA1c levels in older patients with diabetes compared to high GI or high GL diets (MD = –0.31%, 95% CI: –0.42 to 0.19;I2= 75%).
In a SR of 13 RCTs (n= 1138, evidence level: 1) [71], the results showed that a high‐protein diet did not significantly improve HbA1c levels in diabetic patients, but increasing the dietary protein‐to‐energy ratio significantly reduced LDL (MD = –0.10 mmol/L, 95% CI: –0.18 to –0.02,p= 0.02), cholesterol (MD = –0.21 mmol/L, 95% CI: –0.31 to –0.12,p< 0.01), and triglycerides (MD = –0.19 mmol/L, 95% CI: –0.33 to –0.05,p< 0.01).
Within older population, inadequate food intake and dietary imbalances caused by restrictive diets may elevate the risk of malnutrition.
Both the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and the American Dietetic Association (ADA) advocate for relaxing restrictive dietary practices in older adults.
Importantly, older individuals with diabetes should adhere closely to dietitian‐provided guidance when implementing dietary restrictions.
Recommendation 17: Older patients with hypertension can refer to the Chinese Heart‐Healthy Eating Pattern under the guidance of dietitians to reduce blood pressure, total cholesterol levels, and 10‐year cardiovascular disease risk (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
RCTs have shown that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet can lower blood pressure and improve blood lipid profiles, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health.
However, it does not align with Chinese dietary habits and has limited feasibility for widespread adoption in China.
The Chinese Heart‐Healthy diet developed by Peking University is a healthy diet that caters to Chinese taste preferences, including the four major Chinese cuisines (Shandong, Huaiyang, Cantonese, and Sichuan styles).
An RCT (n= 265, evidence level: 2) [72] reported a net change difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of –10.0 mm Hg (95% CI: –12.1 to 7.9) and –3.8 mm Hg (95% CI: –5.0 to 2.5), respectively, in the experimental group after 28 days of following the Chinese Heart‐Healthy Eating Pattern compared to the control group.
Another recent RCT (n= 265, evidence level: 2) [73] demonstrated that the Chinese Heart‐Healthy diet significantly reduced total cholesterol levels (–0.14 mmol/L,p= 0.017) and 10‐year cardiovascular disease risk (–1.24%,p= 0.001) in the Chinese population.
Similarly, older patients diagnosed with hypertension should also follow dietitian recommendations to ensure nutritional adequacy while observing dietary restrictions.
Recommendation 18: Ensuring adequate energy and high‐protein diet intake can help reduce mortality risk in CKD dialysis patients (evidence level: 3, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
A cross‐sectional study (n= 14, evidence level: 4) [74] on the energy requirements of dialysis patients revealed that the dietary energy requirements (DERs) for sedentary, clinically stable dialysis patients were comparable to those of healthy individuals, averaging 31 kcal/(kg·d), yet there is considerable variation in DERs among individuals (range: 26 to 36 kcal/(kg·d)).
DERs are strongly correlated with body weight (r= 0.81,p= 0.002) and weakly associated with resting energy expenditure (r= 0.69,p= 0.01).
A retrospective cohort study (n= 144, evidence level: 3) [75] investigated the relationship between mortality and nutritional parameters in CKD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.
The study indicated that survivors had significantly higher energy intake than the control group (26.7 ± 5.8 kcal/(kg·d) vs. 24.3 ± 4.2 kcal/(kg·d),p= 0.009), and a dietary energy intake of less than 25 kcal/(kg·d) was associated with an increased risk of all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.860, 95% CI: 1.018 to 3.399,p= 0.044).
A prospective cohort study (n= 1039, evidence level: 2) [76] discovered a U‐shaped relationship between dietary energy intake (DEI) and all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients, with inflection points at approximately 40 kcal/(kg·d) and 36.5 kcal/(kg·d).
In patients with DEIs ≥ 40 kcal/(kg·d), the risk of all‐cause mortality significantly increased with higher DEI, whereas the risk of cardiovascular disease death decreased with increasing DEI in participants with DEIs < 36.5 kcal/(kg·d).
These findings suggest a correlation between energy intake and mortality risk.
Regarding protein requirements for dialysis patients, a prospective cohort study (n= 1044, evidence level: 2) [77] demonstrated that a dietary protein intake (DPI) from 1.0 to 1.4 g/(kg·d) in Chinese dialysis patients was linked to a lower risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality.
During a median follow‐up period of 45 months, patients with DPIs of ≤ 1.0 g/(kg·d) (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.42 to 2.38) or ≥ 1.4 g/(kg·d) (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.00 to 2.22) had a significantly higher risk of all‐cause mortality compared to those with a DPI of 1.0 to 1.4 g/(kg·d).
Similar trends were observed for cardiovascular mortality risk.
Another prospective cohort study (n= 60, evidence level: 2) [78] reported that the 5‐year survival rate in the protein‐energy wasting (PEW) group was 30% and 66% in the non‐PEW group (a statistically significant difference).
For the hyperphosphatemia and nonhyperphosphatemia groups, the rates were 57% and 61%, respectively (no significant difference).
The impact of PEW on the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients is more significant than that of hyperphosphatemia.
Normalizing serum phosphorus levels by restricting protein intake may be accompanied by a risk of malnutrition.
Thus, because of the early mortality, patients with PEW should prioritize improving their nutritional status over controlling serum phosphorus levels.
A retrospective cohort study (n= 553, evidence level: 3) [79] found that patients with a persistent standardized protein catabolic rate of < 1.2 g/(kg·d) had a 78% lower survival time compared to those with a rate of ≥ 1.2 g/(kg·d) (95% CI: –81 to –73), indicating that inadequate dietary protein intake increased the risk of all‐cause mortality in end‐stage renal disease patients on dialysis.
Recommendation 19: Currently, evidence showing whether a low‐protein diet can enhance glomerular filtration rate, decrease the risk of progressing to end‐stage renal disease, or reduce all‐cause mortality in nondialysis older patients with chronic kidney disease is insufficient.
Given the risk of sarcopenia in older people, nondialysis older patients with CKD who have sarcopenia are advised to carefully consider choosing a low‐protein diet (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
Protein breakdown results in nitrogenous waste products, such as urea and creatinine, which are typically excreted by the kidneys through urine.
In cases of declining kidney function, a low‐protein diet is often employed to lessen uremic toxins and enhance kidney function and is a primary dietary treatment approach for CKD.
However, the findings of recent meta‐analysis (evidence level: 1) [80] indicated that a low‐protein diet did not significantly reduce mortality (five studies,n= 1680, RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.18,p= 0.24), did not decrease the risk of reaching end‐stage renal disease (six studies,n= 1814, RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.53,p= 0.78), and showed no significant difference in glomerular filtration rate changes (eight studies,n= 1680, SMD = –0.18, 95% CI: –0.75 to 0.38,p= 0.53) compared to a normal protein diet.
Additionally, older patients with CKD are at risk of developing sarcopenia or PEW when restricting protein intake [81].
Therefore, older patients with CKD should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of adopting a low‐protein diet.
Recommendation 20: Providing appropriately adjusted texture diets for older patients with dysphagia who can eat orally can reduce the incidence of choking and aspiration and improve the safety and effectiveness of swallowing (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
Older patients with dysphagia who are medically assessed as capable of oral intake can benefit from receiving differently textured diets according to their oral intake function level (FigureS1, TableS4), which can reduce the occurrence of choking and aspiration, as well as food residue and liquid outflow in the oropharynx, thereby improving the safety and effectiveness of swallowing.
An RCT (n= 100, evidence level: 2) [82] demonstrated that patients who received intervention with the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI)‐adjusted texture diet experienced lower incidences of choking, abnormal speech, oxygen desaturation reductions ≥ 3%, cyanosis, and oropharyngeal food residue and liquid outflow compared to the control group (2%, 2%, 0%, 0%, 24%, 26% vs. 16%, 18%, 16%, 4%, 52%, and 70%, respectively,p< 0.05).
Another RCT (n= 90, evidence level: 2) [83] showed that after implementing IDDSI‐graded diet management intervention for older patients with dysphagia, the WADA drinking test score decreases in the observation group were significantly greater than those in the control group (1.74 ± 0.49 vs. 2.82 ± 0.41,p< 0.05), and the SF‐36 total average score was significantly higher than that in the control group (89.25 ± 6.02 vs. 82.44 ± 6.27,p< 0.05), indicating an improvement in swallowing function.
It is essential to highlight the potential risk associated with excessive use of thickening agents in dietary modification practices, which could contribute to malnutrition or trigger symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Recommendation 21: Enhancing the sensory attributes and nutritional density of texture‐modified diets can address the inadequate nutritional intake in patients with dysphagia (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: A, consensus rate: 94.12%).
When preparing texture‐modified diets, attention should extend beyond physical texture to encompass sensory aspects such as visual presentation, aroma, taste, and overall appeal.
A systematic review comprising 18 studies involving elderly residents in nursing homes (evidence level: 2) suggested that shaping grade 4 pureed foods into visually recognizable and attractive forms can enhance nutritional intake.
Furthermore, a meta‐analysis synthesizing data from 35 randomized controlled trials, cross‐sectional, and cohort studies (n= 163, evidence level:1) demonstrated that shaping texture‐modified diets significantly improved energy and protein intake, reporting a mean difference (MD) of 273.8 kJ/day (95% CI: –419.1 to –128.6,p= 0.0002) and 12.4 g/day (95% CI: –17.9 to –6.8,p< 0.0001), respectively.
Nonetheless, findings from the same analysis (n= 360, evidence level: 1) indicated that texture‐modified diets are often accompanied by reduced nutrient density, potentially leading to inadequate intake of key nutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, vitamins B1, B6, B12, D, E, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
To address these nutritional gaps, fortification strategies, including oral nutritional supplements or nutrient‐enriched pureed diets, are recommended.
In cases where oral nutritional intake fails to meet nutritional requirements adequately, enteral tube feeding should be considered.
Recommendation 22: The dehydration status of older patients with dysphagia who are capable of oral intake must be closely monitored and their dehydration indicators must be regularly evaluated (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B).
The texture of liquid foods should be adjusted based on the degree of the patient's dysphagia (TableS5) to ensure sufficient hydration and nutritional intake (evidence level: 3, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
A comprehensive meta‐analysis, including various study designs, such as RCTs and cohort studies (n= 22,398, evidence level: 1) [86], revealed that 24% (95% CI: 7 to 46) of noninstitutionalized older individuals were dehydrated and those with dysphagia had a higher risk of hypohydration (i.e., dehydration) [8].
Findings from an RCT (n= 95, evidence level: 2) [87] demonstrated that patients with dysphagia, particularly those who could eat orally, exhibited significantly higher dehydration indicators compared to those fed via a nasogastric tube.
Specifically, orally eating patients showed a marked increase in the average number of dehydration markers (3.8 ± 1.3 vs. 2 ± 1.4,p< 0.001), and lower urine output (< 800 ml/d) was also more frequently observed (39% vs. 12%,p= 0.002).
A prospective cohort study (n= 477, evidence level: 2) [88] indicated that adjusting the texture of liquid foods based on the volume‐viscosity swallow test clinical assessment results was linked to patient compliance, short‐term mortality, and the risk of complications.
Patients who closely adhered to recommendations for adjusting liquid texture and total fluid intake experienced reduced short‐term mortality (45.8% vs. 90.2%,p< 0.001) and a lower risk of complications (80.5% vs. 90.7%,p= 0.004) 1 month postdischarge.
These findings underscore the importance of individualized dietary modifications for elderly patients with dysphagia to sustain proper hydration and adequate nutrition, which is critical for their overall health and well‐being.
Additionally, it is equally crucial to emphasize regular follow‐up assessments during dietary interventions, given that dysphagia severity may evolve over time.
Recommendation 23: Offering home enteral nutritional support to older patients who are not hospitalized and are experiencing a decrease in dietary intake, compromised ability to absorb nutrients, swallowing difficulties, or have increased or special nutritional requirements is essential (expert opinion, consensus rate: 100%).
Referring to epidemiological studies on family enteral nutrition at home and abroad [89,90,91,92,93,94], its common indications include: neurological diseases, head and neck tumors, gastrointestinal tumors and other tumors, cerebral palsy, nonneoplastic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. fistula, esophageal stenosis, inflammatory bowel disease), head injury, malabsorption syndrome (e.g. short bowel syndrome), severe intestinal motility disorders, hereditary metabolic diseases and cystic fibrosis.
The indications for home enteral nutrition are shown in Table3[95].
Indications for home enteral nutrition in older patients.
Abbreviaions: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.
Recommendation 24: Home enteral nutritional support can enhance the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life in patients with gastrointestinal tumors, as well as decrease the incidence of complications (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 94.12%).
Tube feeding is more effective than oral nutritional supplementation in improving nutritional status in older postesophageal cancer surgery patients (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 94.12%).
Home enteral nutritional support plays a significant role in improving postoperative nutritional status and quality of life and reducing complications in older patients with upper gastrointestinal tumors.
A meta‐analysis of 23 RCT studies (n= 3010, evidence level: 1) [96] indicated that home enteral nutritional support significantly improved the postoperative quality of life (MD = 2.08 points, 95% CI: 1.50 to 2.67,p< 0.001), increased body weight (MD = 1.87 kg, 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.43,p< 0.001), ALB levels (MD = 1.27 g/L, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.82,p< 0.001), and prealbumin levels (MD = 30.79 mg/L, 95% CI: 7.29 to 54.29,p= 0.01) in older patients who underwent the resection of upper gastrointestinal tumors compared to a normal diet.
Another meta‐analysis that included 15 RCT studies (n= 1059, evidence level: 1) [97] found that home enteral nutritional support, which included both tube feeding and ONS, significantly reduced weight loss (SMD = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.24 to 2.73,p< 0.01) and increased ALB levels (SMD = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.91,p< 0.01), Hb levels (weighted mean difference WMD = 7.45 g/L, 95% CI: 5.05 to 9.86,p< 0.01), prealbumin levels (WMD = 21.6 mg/L, 95% CI: 5.96 to 37.24,p< 0.01), and transferrin levels (WMD = 16.44 mg/L, 95% CI: 13.51 to 19.38,p< 0.01), while also decreasing the risk of malnutrition or latent malnutrition (RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.73,p< 0.01).
Furthermore, physical function (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, QLQ‐C30 or Quality of Life Questionnaire‐esophageal‐specific module 18, WMD = 5.29; 95% CI: 1.86 to 8.73) and fatigue (WMD = –8.59, 95% CI: –12.61 to –4.58) were superior in patients on home enteral nutritional support compared to those on a normal diet.
Home enteral tube feeding nutritional support was found to be more effective in improving body weight (WMD = 2.69 kg, 95% CI: 1.97 to 3.41 vs. WMD = 0.82 kg, 95% CI: –0.15 to 1.79), and ALB levels (WMD = 1.9 g/L, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.59 vs. WMD = 0.4 g/L, 95% CI: –0.15 to 1.31) than ONS.
Additionally, a meta‐analysis that included four RCT studies (n= 314, evidence level: 1) [98] suggested that home enteral tube feeding nutritional support increased postoperative lean body mass (WMD = 0.76 kg, 95% CI: 0.04 to 1.48,p= 0.04) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index values (WMD = 0.30 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.58,p= 0.03) in patients with esophageal cancer, and reduced patient fatigue (WMD = –12.73, 95% CI: –14.8 to –10.66,p< 0.001) and the incidence of postoperative pneumonia (RR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.81,p= 0.004).
A meta‐analysis that included nine RCT studies (n= 757, evidence level: 1) [99] showed that home enteral tube feeding nutritional support improved postoperative nausea/vomiting (WMD = –5.43, 95% CI: –8.29 to –2.57,p= 0.002), fatigue (WMD = –11.76, 95% CI: –16.21 to –7.32,p< 0.001), anorexia (WMD = –8.48, 95% CI: –14.27 to –4.88,p= 0.001), diarrhea (WMD = –3.9, 95% CI: –7.37 to –0.43,p= 0.03), and sleep disorders (WMD = –7.64, 95% CI: –12.79 to –2.5,p= 0.004) after esophageal cancer surgery.
An RCT (n= 212, evidence level: 2) [100] indicated that ONS reduced postoperative skeletal muscle index values (39.75 ± 5.83 cm2/m2vs. 38.01 ± 6.18 cm2/m2,p= 0.037) and sarcopenia prevalence (28.6% vs. 42.1%,p= 0.040) after colorectal cancer surgery.
These studies collectively support the benefits of home enteral nutritional support for patients with gastrointestinal tumors.
Further research is warranted to explore the efficacy of home nutritional support in older patients with other types of tumors.
Recommendation 25: Tube feeding can improve the quality of life of stroke patients with severe and chronic oropharyngeal dysphagia who are discharged from the hospital, and it has good cost‐effectiveness (evidence level: 3, recommendation level: C, consensus rate: 100%).
Cerebrovascular events, such as acute stroke, can lead to poststroke oropharyngeal dysphagia (PS‐OD).
A meta‐analysis of 42 studies (n= 26,366, evidence level: 2) [101] showed that the combined prevalence of PS‐OD was 42%.
A cohort study (n= 25, evidence level: 3) [102] showed that the cost per quality‐adjusted life‐year over 3 years for patients with cerebrovascular accidents receiving enteral nutrition tube feeding in nursing homes was £12,817 (95% CI: £10,351 to £16,826).
The cost‐effectiveness of enteral tube feeding at home or in nursing homes was better than that of other interventions.
Recommendation 26: For patients with severe and advanced Alzheimer's disease, hand feeding should be considered first to increase pleasure and comfort (expert opinion, consensus rate: 94.12%).
If hand feeding is not possible, the increased risk of death and complications from tube feeding should be fully considered, and decisions should be made, respecting the opinions of the patient and family (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 94.12%).
Relatively little research has been conducted on hand feeding, but its advantages include allowing patients to enjoy the satisfaction of eating, socializing during mealtimes, and avoiding the restraint of being tube‐fed.
A meta‐analysis of six studies in 2024 (n= 1796, evidence level: 1) [103] indicated that the incidence of pneumonia (RR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.77,p< 0.01) and mortality (RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.93,p= 0.03) in patients with Alzheimer's disease who received hand feeding was lower compared with tube‐fed patients, but it had no effect on readmission rates.
If hand feeding is not possible, the increased risk of death and complications from tube feeding should be fully considered.
A Cochrane review that included 14 RCTs and non‐RCTs (n= 1812, evidence level: 1) [104] showed no effect of tube feeding support in prolonging the survival time of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Another SR of 12 trials (n= 5666, evidence level: 1) [105] found that the mortality rate increased in patients with advanced dementia who received tube feeding (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.07), but there was no significant difference in survival time and nutritional status between the two groups.
At the same time, sensitivity analysis found that patients who underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy had an increased risk of pneumonia (OR = 3.56, 95% CI: 2.32 to 5.44) and pressure sores (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.92 to 2.63) than those without tube feeding.
However, in some cultures, starting or maintaining (partial) enteral feeding is seen as a basic human right, not a medical procedure, and stopping (partial) enteral feeding due to concerns about increased mortality risk may not be acceptable.
Recommendation 27: Nutritional intervention can improve muscle strength, quality, and function in older individuals with sarcopenia (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: D), and a better improvement effect may be achieved when combined with exercise interventions (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
Nutritional intervention is considered one of the key interventions for sarcopenia [106].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that nutritional intervention has a positive impact on both muscle mass and muscle strength in older individuals with sarcopenia.
An SR and meta‐analysis that included 29 studies (n= 2255, evidence level: 1) [107] showed that nutritional intervention had a significant effect on improving muscle mass (SMD = 0.324, 95% CI: 0.186 to 0.463;P≤ 0.001;I2= 72.5%).
Among seven nutritional interventions, four had a significant positive impact on increasing muscle mass: amino acids (SMD = 0.586, 95% CI: 0.181 to 0.991,p= 0.005;I2= 60.9%); creatine (SMD = 0.633, 95% CI: 0.213 to 1.053,p= 0.003;I2= 0%); beta‐hydroxy beta‐methylbutyrate (HMB) (SMD = 0.522, 95% CI: 0.175 to 0.868,p= 0.003;I2= 5.4%); and protein plus amino acids (SMD = 0.432, 95% CI: 0.016 to 0.849,p= 0.042;I2= 58.5%).
In an SR of six RCTs [108], older individuals received ONS in all of the included studies.
The nutritional supplements contained protein (10 to 40 grams per day), energy, and other macro and micronutrients.
The quantitative analysis results showed that the maximum grip strength of older individuals receiving nutritional intervention was 1.97 kg higher than that of the control group (95% CI: 0.55 to 3.39,p= 0.006).
Another meta‐analysis of seven RCTs (n= 301, evidence level: 1) [109] showed that a 3‐month ONS significantly improved the knee extension strength of older individuals with sarcopenia (WMD = 0.11 Nm/kg, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.20,p= 0.008), but had no significant effect on limb skeletal muscle mass, the limb skeletal muscle mass index, fat‐free body weight, grip strength, or walking speed.
Some studies reported that the combination of nutrition and exercise intervention may not improve the muscle strength, muscle quality, or function of older people compared with exercise intervention alone.
A meta‐analysis that included nine studies (n= 454, evidence level: 1) [110] showed that the combination of nutrition and exercise intervention had no significant difference in improvements in appendicular skeletal muscle mass (MD = –0.38 kg, 95% CI: –0.81 to 0.06,p= 0.09), maximum grip strength (MD = –0.01 kg, 95% CI: –1.29 to 1.27,p= 0.99), knee extension strength (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI: –0.12 to 0.36,p= 0.34), or walking speed (MD = 0.00 m/s, 95% CI: –0.04 to 0.05,p= 0.92) compared with exercise intervention alone.
Nutrition combined with exercise intervention may have a better effect on sarcopenia.
A meta‐analysis of 26 RCTs (n= 2387, evidence level: 1) [111] showed that exercise intervention alone (SMD = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.12 to 2.11), nutritional intervention alone (SMD = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.16 to 2.11), and exercise combined with nutritional intervention (SMD = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.97) significantly increased the grip strength of older people with sarcopenia compared to the control group.
Exercise intervention alone and exercise combined with nutritional intervention improved dynamic balance (SMD = –1.76, 95% CI: –2.24 to –1.28; SMD = –1.02, 95% CI: –1.64 to –0.39).
Another meta‐analysis that included 12 RCTs (n= 863, evidence level: 1) [112] showed that exercise combined with nutritional intervention significantly increased limb skeletal muscle mass (MD = 0.41 kg, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.72,p= 0.01;I2= 8%), grip strength (MD = 1.24 kg, 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.99,p= 0.001;I2= 0%), and walking speed (MD = 0.04 m/s, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.06,p= 0.0002;I2= 0%).
The results of a meta‐analysis [109] showed that a combined 3‐month exercise and nutritional intervention significantly increased the walking speed of the subjects compared with exercise intervention alone (WMD = –0.07 m/s; 95% CI: –0.13 to –0.00;p= 0.04), but no significant differences were observed in limb skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, or knee extension strength.
A 3‐month combined exercise with nutritional intervention significantly increased the knee extension strength of the subjects compared with nutritional intervention alone (WMD = 10.43 Nm, 95% CI: 6.20 to 14.66,p <0.01), but no significant differences were observed in limb skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, or walking speed.
Recommendation 28: Protein combined with exercise intervention can improve muscle strength and quality in older individuals with sarcopenia (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: B, consensus rate: 100%).
Research [113] indicated that consuming an appropriate amount of high‐quality protein was beneficial for ensuring muscle protein synthesis and maintaining muscle mass; however, the effect on muscle strength was not conclusive.
Essential amino acids can promote muscle protein synthesis in older people, but the impact of amino acid supplements on muscle protein synthesis in older adults is inconsistent across different studies.
An SR [114] of four RCTs and seven prospective cohort studies (evidence level: 1) showed that muscle mass and strength were positively correlated with protein intake.
However, some studies reported that protein intervention did not significantly improve muscle strength and quality in older people.
A meta‐analysis that included 28 RCTs (n= 1926, evidence level: 1) [115] showed that the group of older people with protein intervention had no significant changes in lean body mass (WMD = 0.34 kg, 95% CI: –0.21 to 0.89;I2= 90.01%), appendicular lean mass (WMD = 0.4 kg, 95% CI: –0.01 to 0.81;I2= 90.38%), grip strength (WMD = 0.69 kg, 95% CI: –0.69 to 2.06;I2= 94.52%), or knee extension strength (WMD = 1.88 kg, 95% CI: –0.6 to 4.35;I2= 95.35%) compared with the control group.
However, subgroup analysis showed that the group of older patients with protein intervention combined with resistance exercise had significantly improved appendicular lean mass (WMD = 0.54 kg, 95% CI: 0.03 to 1.05;I2= 89.76%) and grip strength (WMD = 1.71 kg, 95% CI: 0.12 to 3.3;I2= 88.71%).
A meta‐analysis that included eight RCTs (n= 557, evidence level: 1) [116] showed that supplementation with protein or amino acids had no significant effect on lean body mass (0.014 kg, 95% CI: –0.152 to 0.18), leg press strength (2.26 kg, 95% CI: –0.56 to 5.08), leg extension strength (0.75 kg, 95% CI: –1.96 to 3.47), or grip strength (–0.002 kg, 95% CI: –0.182 to 0.179).
An SR that included 37 RCTs (evidence level: 1) found [117] independent improvement effects in muscle mass and strength in older people who used protein supplements (7.4 to 45 grams of protein per day) in three studies, and no study reported an independent improvement effect of protein on physical activity ability.
At the same time, the use of essential amino acid preparations by older people also did not produce independent improvement effects on muscle mass, muscle strength, and activity ability.
Protein combined with exercise intervention may have a more significant effect on improving muscle strength and quality in older people.
A meta‐analysis that included 17 RCTs (n= 892, evidence level: 1) [118] showed that resistance exercise intervention combined with protein supplementation increased lean body mass (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.84,p< 0.01), and appendicular lean mass (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.60,p= 0.01), improved fat mass (SMD = –0.61, 95% CI: –0.93 to –0.29,p= 0.0002;I2= 72%,p< 0.01) and body fat percentage (SMD = –1.14, 95% CI: –1.67 to –0.60,p< 0.0001;I2= 90%,p< 0.01), and increased muscle cross‐sectional area (SMD = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.96,p= 0.001;I2= 83%,p< 0.01), and leg strength (SMD = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.98,p< 0.01;I2= 67%,p< 0.01) in older people compared with the control group; however, no difference in grip strength was observed.
Recommendation 29: Supplementation with a nutritional supplement containing leucine can improve muscle strength and physical activity ability in older individuals with sarcopenia (evidence level: 1, recommendation level: A, consensus rate: 100%).
Supplementation with leucine alone or in combination with other nutritional formulations may have a positive impact on strength and activity ability in older people.
But there is still insufficient evidence to show its effect on improving muscle mass.
A meta‐analysis that included 16 RCTs (n= 999, evidence level: 1) [119] included studies of older individuals receiving leucine supplementation at doses ranging from 2 g/d to 7.8 g/d, mainly added in the form of amino acid formulations, whey protein, casein, dry whey, or commercially available protein‐rich drinks.
The results showed that weight (MD = 0.75 kg, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.28,p= 0.005), and lean body mass increased in subjects with sarcopenia more after leucine supplementation than in the control group (MD = 1.14 kg, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.74,p= 0.0002).
An SR and meta‐analysis included six randomized controlled studies (n= 699, evidence level: 1) [120] where a nutritional intervention was conducted in older individuals with sarcopenia for 4–13 weeks using a protein supplement with a leucine dose of 3∼6 g/d.
The leucine group's muscle strength significantly improved (SMD = 0.794, 95% CI: 0.104 to 1.485,p= 0.024) compared to the control group, while no statistically significant differences were found in muscle mass (SMD = 0.763, 95% CI: –0.353 to 1.880,p= 0.180) and physical activity ability (SMD = 0.788, 95% CI: –0.010 to 1.586,p= 0.053).
A meta‐analysis of 17 RCTs (n= 1418, evidence level: 1) showed that [121] leucine alone or in combination with other supplements did not significantly change the lean body mass of older people (WMD = 0.29 kg, 95% CI: –0.06 to 0.63,p= 0.102).
The grip strength of older individuals receiving leucine alone did not significantly improve (WMD = 1.23 kg, 95% CI: –0.58 to 3.03,p= 0.183), but the combination of leucine with other formulations significantly improved their grip strength (WMD = 1.55 kg, 95% CI: 0.16 to 2.95,p= 0.029).
Leucine intervention with a dose ≥ 5 g/d also significantly improved the walking speed of older people (WMD = 0.03 m/s, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.05,p= 0.009).
Leucine supplements containing vitamin D significantly improved the walking speed (WMD = 0.03 m/s, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.05,p= 0.008) and grip strength (WMD = 2.17 kg, 95% CI: 0.24 to 4.10,p= 0.027) of older people.
Studies showed that HMB had certain positive benefits for improving or maintaining the muscle quality, strength, and function of older individuals with sarcopenia [122].
A meta‐analysis that included nine RCTs (n= 896, evidence level: 1) showed that [123] HMB intervention significantly improved the upper limb muscle strength (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.43,p< 0.009) and lower limb muscle strength (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.69,p< 0.00001) of older participants compared with the control group.
A meta‐analysis that included 15 RCTs (n= 2137, evidence level: 1) showed that [124] HMB or HMB‐containing supplements increased skeletal muscle mass (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.50,p= 0.05) compared with the control group.
Intervention with HMB combined with arginine and glutamine increased muscle mass in subjects (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: –0.01 to 0.99,p= 0.05;I2= 67%,p= 0.02).
HMB or HMB‐containing supplements improved muscle strength (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.50,p= 0.001;I2= 0%) compared with the control group.
Subgroup analysis results showed that HMB alone (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.53,p= 0.05) and HMB‐containing ONS (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.68;p= 0.02;I2= 0%) both improved muscle strength.
HMB intervention increased subjects' grip strength (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.66,p= 0.008;I2= 0%,p= 0.75) and leg extension strength (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.48,p= 0.006;I2= 0%,p= 0.85).
A meta‐analysis of five RCTs (n= 400, evidence level: 1) showed that [125] HMB‐containing nutritional supplements significantly improved the lean body mass (SMD = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.00 to 3.16,p= 0.0002;I2= 92%) of older individuals with sarcopenia compared with the control group.
However, there was no significant improvement in grip strength (SMD = 1.31, 95% CI: –1.54 to 4.16,p= 0.37;I2= 98%) and stand‐walk test times (SMD = –0.73, 95% CI: –3.85 to 2.40,p= 0.65;I2= 96%).
A meta‐analysis that included seven RCTs (n= 287, evidence level: 1) [126] included studies with HMB intervention doses of 2 g/d to 3 g/d and showed that the intervention group of older individuals had more significant muscle increases (SMD = 0.352, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.59,p= 0.004) compared with the control group, while no statistical difference in fat mass was seen between the two groups at the end of the intervention (SMD = –0.08, 95% CI: –0.32 to 0.159,p= 0.511).
Recommendation 31: Vitamin D supplementation combined with other nutrients may improve muscle strength and mass in older individuals with sarcopenia (evidence level: 1, recommendation grade: B, consensus rate: 100%).
The current research on the effectiveness of a single vitamin D supplement in enhancing muscle mass, strength, and function in older adults has yielded inconsistent results.
An RCT involving 1094 prediabetic older participants (evidence level: 2) [127] demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of sarcopenia compared to the control group (HR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.83,p= 0.0065).
However, an SR encompassing four RCTs and seven prospective cohort studies (evidence level: 1) [114] concluded that there was no consensus regarding the adjunctive role of vitamin D in treating sarcopenia.
High‐quality studies are needed to further substantiate the impact of vitamin D on muscle mass, strength, and function in older people [113].
Combining vitamin D with other nutrients might beneficially affect muscle mass in older populations.
A network meta‐analysis of nine RCTs (n= 1420, evidence level: 1) [128] revealed that vitamin D supplementation, along with protein and exercise, was more effective in improving grip strength among participants with sarcopenia (WMD = 3.86 kg, 95% CI: 0.52 to 7.21).
Vitamin D intervention also reduced the time required for the sit‐to‐stand test (WMD = –1.32 s, 95% CI: –1.98 to –0.65), though no significant effects on gait speed or overall muscle mass were observed.
Another meta‐analysis (n= 637, evidence level: 1) [129] showed that enteral nutrition formulas containing vitamin D, leucine, and whey protein significantly increased appendicular skeletal muscle mass in older patients with sarcopenia compared to controls (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.44,p= 0.003;I2= 26%), yet did not result in notable improvements in grip strength (SMD = 1.03, 95% CI: –0.10 to 2.16,p= 0.07;I2= 97%) or the Short Physical Performance Battery scores (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI: –0.86 to 2.88,p= 0.29;I2= 98%).
Recommendation 32: Postdischarge follow‐up may improve the nutritional status, reduce rehospitalization rates, and decrease the medical expenses of older patients receiving enteral nutrition (evidence level: 3, recommendation grade: C, consensus rate: 100%).
A retrospective cohort study (n= 80,080, evidence level: 3) [130] found that patients still receiving enteral nutrition at discharge had a 1.4 times higher risk of readmission within 30 days compared to those not receiving it (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.27 to 1.55).
Patients on home enteral nutrition are at high risk for readmission and require ongoing attention and follow‐up postdischarge.
Adherence to enteral nutrition after discharge is generally low among patients [131,132].
Research suggests that postdischarge follow‐up can improve clinical outcomes and reduce medical costs.
A nonconcurrent case‐control study (n= 313, evidence level: 4) [133] revealed that follow‐up by dietitians significantly reduced gastrostomy‐related readmission rates from 23% to 2% (p= 0.0001).
An RCT (n= 106, evidence level: 2) [134] demonstrated that patients receiving dietitian follow‐up interventions postdischarge showed significant improvements in body weight (MD = 5.12 kg, 95% CI: 3.86 to 6.38,p< 0.01), BMI (MD = 1.69 kg/m2, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.17,p< 0.01), lean body mass (MD = 4.18 kg, 95% CI: 2.72 to 5.65,p< 0.001), calf circumference (MD = 1.27 cm, 95% CI: 0.19 to 2.33,p= 0.02), mid‐upper arm circumference (MD = 2.19 cm, 95% CI: 1.16 to 3.21,p< 0.001), waist circumference (MD = 2.62 cm, 95% CI: 0.74 to 4.51,p= 0.01), and the Simplified Physical Status Scale scores (MD = 0.91 points, 95% CI: 0.29 to 1.79,p= 0.02) compared to those who received only nutrition education.
An observational study (n= 100, evidence level: 3) [135] comparing inpatient and postdischarge medical costs showed that regular follow‐ups with a family care unit could save medical expenses (€2970.18 vs. €8309.30,p< 0.01).
Dietitians play a crucial role in developing postdischarge nutrition management plans [136,137,138], ensuring the continuity of nutrition management after discharge.
They also have a significant impact on patient education [139].
Lack of awareness about the consequences of postdischarge malnutrition among patients and their caregivers can decrease adherence to postdischarge nutrition management [131,140,141].
Furthermore, insufficient recognition of the importance of nutrition might lead patients and caregivers to refuse home nutrition follow‐up.
Therefore, patients and their caregivers must understand postdischarge nutrition plans.
Dietitians should emphasize the significance of adhering to the postdischarge nutrition regimen and the necessity of attending follow‐ups.
The home nutrition follow‐up team should provide all patients and their caregivers with simple, easy‐to‐understand written materials (e.g., brochures) or access to free resources (e.g., mobile apps or telehealth consultations) at discharge to enhance self‐management capabilities.
Recommendation 33: Family follow‐up work can be conducted using various methods, such as WeChat (mini‐programs), dietary diaries, video consultations, and hotline telephone services (evidence level: 2, recommendation level: grade B, consensus rate: 100%).
An RCT (n= 65, evidence level: 2) [142] demonstrated that WeChat‐based health education effectively improved the knowledge, attitude, and practice levels of primary caregivers.
The scores in the experimental group were significantly higher 8 weeks postdischarge than those in the control group (71.42 ±2.92 vs. 61.75 ± 3.55,p< 0.001).
The experimental group also showed an improvements in ALB levels compared to the control group (41.20 ±7.99 g/L vs. 47.19 ± 6.95 g/L,p< 0.05).
Additionally, WeChat‐based health education reduced nasogastric feeding complications 8 weeks postdischarge.
The incidence rates of constipation (18.18% vs. 40.62%), diarrhea (15.15% vs. 40.62%), aspiration (9.09% vs. 28.12%), tube blockage (9.09% vs. 28.12%), and nasal mucosal injury (18.18% vs. 43.75%) were significantly lower in the experimental group (p< 0.05), ensuring the safety of patients discharged with nasogastric tubes.
A non‐RCT (n= 100, evidence level: 4) [143] indicated that applying dietary diary management to older patients after esophageal cancer surgery could improve their weight (–2.97 kg vs. –4.07 kg,p< 0.05), BMI (–1.05 kg/m2vs. –1.5 kg/m2,p< 0.05), serum ALB levels (41.77 g/L vs. 38.81 g/L,p< 0.001), prealbumin levels (257.04 mg/L vs. 233.69 mg/L,p< 0.05), and Hb levels (130.68 g/L vs. 126.59 g/L,p< 0.1), and reduce nutritional risk (44.68% vs. 66.00%,p< 0.05).
Another RCT (n= 100, evidence level: 2) [144] found that video consultations between family nutrition practitioners and clinical nutritionists reduced metabolic complications in frail older patients (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.00 to 6.91,p= 0.049).
Recommendation 34: The first follow‐up visit after nutritional intervention is suggested to occur within 2 weeks.
The frequency and timing of subsequent follow‐ups should be tailored to the disease characteristics and nutritional needs of the patient (expert opinion, consensus rate: 94.12%).
To date, no studies have demonstrated a difference in clinical outcomes based on various postdischarge follow‐up frequencies and schedules.
Based on clinical practice, the working group recommends conducting the initial follow‐up within 2 weeks after nutritional intervention.
Furthermore, different follow‐up frequencies and schedules should be recommended based on specific disease characteristics and nutritional requirements.
Most studies have set the follow‐up duration at 6 months postdischarge, with two to eight follow‐up visits [134,145–148].
Given the rapid changes in the postdischarge course of surgical patients, a short, frequent, and quick strategy for follow‐up is recommended.
This involves more frequent but shorter follow‐ups, such as once every 2 weeks for 1 month postdischarge in surgical patients.
For chronic disease patients, a longer cycle and less frequent follow‐up plan can be adopted, such as once every month for 3 months postdischarge.
Recommendation 35: Follow‐up content should include nutritional assessment, treatment goals, adherence evaluation, and complication monitoring (expert opinion, consensus rate: 94.12%).
From registration to follow‐up, the process should include a complete screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment continuum.
There should be a focus on the safety and efficacy of nutritional management, with adjustments to treatment goals made as needed based on changes in the patient's condition and compliance.
Of particular importance is the monitoring and managing of complications in enterally‐fed patients, which are critical for the successful implementation of home enteral nutrition regimens.
The follow‐up process includes nutritional screening, assessment, setting of treatment goals, compliance evaluation, and complication monitoring, as detailed in Table4.
Follow‐up content and plan formulation for home enteral nutrition administration in older patients in China.
For patients receiving home enteral nutrition by tube feeding, it is necessary to regularly monitor their electrolytes.
The HNA process for elderly patients consists of two key components: technical and personnel support and a closed‐loop operational workflow, as illustrated in Figure2.

Formation of a Multidisciplinary HNA Team: A multidisciplinary team comprising dietitians, physicians, nurses, rehabilitation therapists, psychotherapists, and caregivers is established to deliver comprehensive nutritional management services for elderly patients.
Enhancement of Training and Education: A structured training and education system is implemented, including regular professional development sessions for HNA team members to improve service quality and ensure up‐to‐date knowledge in geriatric nutrition care.
Integration of Digital Medical Technologies: The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and remote monitoring systems facilitates the efficient implementation of HNA, supporting data management, patient monitoring, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
Nutritional Screening: An initial nutritional risk assessment is conducted for elderly patients, including those recently discharged from hospitals, residents of elderly care facilities, and community‐dwelling seniors.
The screening frequency is tailored to individual risk levels to optimize early intervention.
Nutritional Assessment and Diagnosis: For elderly patients identified as at risk of malnutrition or requiring nutritional intervention for chronic disease management, a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment is performed.
This includes medical history review, dietary intake analysis, anthropometric measurements, laboratory testing, integrated evaluations of nutritional and physical function, and assessments of social activity levels.
HNA Documentation: A structured nutritional management record is established for each patient, documenting essential information such as basic demographics, chronic disease diagnoses and control status, discharge diagnoses, inpatient treatment plans, nutritional management goals, and specific intervention strategies, including dietary plans, nutritional education, and treatment modalities.
Individualized Home Nutritional Intervention: Personalized nutritional interventions are provided based on the patient's condition.
These include home‐based nutrition education, senior‐friendly dietary modifications, and home enteral or parenteral nutrition support.
Detailed records of interventions are maintained to ensure continuity of care.
Follow‐Up Management: A structured follow‐up system is implemented, comprising initial follow‐ups, periodic reassessments, and termination of follow‐up when appropriate.
Adjustments to the nutritional management plan are made based on the patient's progress and treatment goals, with all follow‐up records systematically documented in the patient's file.
This structured framework ensures a comprehensive, evidence‐based approach to elderly nutritional care, promoting improved health outcomes through interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous quality improvement.
This updated consensus was developed in response to shifts in the disease spectrum among elderly populations, advancements in diagnostic and treatment technologies, and the emergence of new evidence.
Building upon the 2017 version, this iteration incorporates digital medical technologies, expands recommendations for postdischarge nutritional screening, elder‐friendly diets, and follow‐up care, and also provides more targeted guidance for specific high‐risk populations.
The recommendations outlined in this consensus are intended for healthcare professionals in medical institutions, elderly care facilities, and community‐based primary health services, and where home nutritional administration (HNA) services are provided beyond hospital settings.
Given these organizations' disparities in service capacity, collaboration between medical institutions, elderly care facilities, and community health service providers is strongly encouraged.
A multidisciplinary approach can be fostered by leveraging shared resources and technical support to enhance HNA services' continuity and overall quality.
As a vast and ethnically diverse country, China presents unique challenges in nutritional management for the elderly, influenced by regional differences in living conditions, cultural backgrounds, and individual dietary preferences.
These factors may affect the effectiveness of nutritional interventions.
Meanwhile, the group of older patients is highly heterogeneous, ranging from very robust to those with varying degrees of frailty.
It is crucial to recognize this diversity when making recommendations and setting nutritional treatment goals.
Therefore, further localized research is required to optimize home nutritional administration strategies tailored to the specific needs of elderly patients across different regions or with varying degrees of frailty.
Upon publication, this consensus will be presented at multiple international and national nutrition academic conferences to facilitate the dissemination.
Additionally, to ensure effective implementation, specialized training programs on HNA will be organized for elderly care facilities and community health service providers.
These initiatives aim to support the practical application of HNA recommendations in real‐world settings, ultimately improving nutritional care for elderly populations.
