Vaccine hesitancy remains a significant public health challenge globally, requiring innovative, evidence‐based approaches to improve uptake.
This systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluated the effectiveness of stage‐of‐change (SOC)‐tailored interventions, the customized strategies based on an individual's readiness for behavioral changes, in promoting vaccination uptake.
Data were synthesized from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐experimental, and non‐experimental studies identified through MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, and APA PsycInfo databases.
Five eligible studies published between 2004 and 2023 were included, with three RCTs and one quasi‐experimental study contributing to the meta‐analysis.
The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) for vaccination uptake was 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49, 0.59,p< .001), indicating a significant medium effect size with no heterogeneity (I2= 0%,p= .88).
Subgroup analyses showed SOC‐tailored interventions were particularly effective for older adults (SMD = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.92,p= .03) and for parents or caregivers to increase children's vaccination uptake (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.74,p= .02).
These findings provided preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions in addressing vaccine hesitancy.
Future research should explore geographically diverse settings and cost‐effective delivery methods to maximize the impact.
Vaccines demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in preventing various diseases (World Health Organization,2024a,2024b,2024c,2024d).
However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal jeopardize public health progress achieved through vaccination.
Vaccine hesitancy, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services, remains a significant global health challenge (Larson et al.,2022; World Health Organization,2019).
Identified as one of the top 10 global health threats, vaccine hesitancy encompasses a spectrum of behaviors, including vaccine refusal, which refers to the outright rejection of vaccination.
It is a complex, context‐specific phenomenon that varies across time, place, and vaccine type.
It is shaped by factors such as complacency (perceived risk of vaccine‐preventable diseases), convenience (access and availability of vaccination services), and confidence (trust in vaccines, health‐care providers, and policymakers) (Bussink‐Voorend et al.,2022; MacDonald,2015; Rizzo et al.,2024).
High rates of vaccine hesitancy have been reported across various vaccines.
In China, coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) vaccine hesitancy ranged from 32% to 56.4% (Chan, Fang, et al.,2023).
Globally, a systematic review reported seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) hesitancy ranging from 22% to 48% (Y. Wang, Zhang, et al.,2023).
This hesitancy is driven by a variety of factors, including misinformation, vaccine safety concerns, distrust in health‐care systems, and vaccine fatigue—defined as decreased motivation to seek or receive vaccination because of perceived overexposure to vaccination campaigns or repeated vaccination requirements, such as annual boosters (Stamm et al.,2023; Y. Wang, Zhang, et al.,2023).
Although vaccine fatigue is not a new phenomenon, it has gained increasing attention during the COVID‐19 pandemic, where frequent vaccine recommendations and booster campaigns have amplified its impact (Stamm et al.,2023).
Additional contributors to vaccine hesitancy include cultural beliefs, social norms, access to health care, and personal vaccination experiences (Begum et al.,2024).
Together, these factors underscore the complexity of vaccine hesitancy and the pressing need for tailored, context‐specific interventions to effectively address this global health challenge.
Educational interventions are one of the tailored approaches to address the root causes of vaccine hesitancy (Misra et al.,2024).
By improving public knowledge, correcting misconceptions, and promoting positive attitudes toward vaccination, these interventions directly address key barriers, such as misinformation and distrust (World Health Organization,2024e).
Moreover, educational interventions are particularly crucial in building vaccine confidence and fostering acceptance in populations where hesitancy is driven by access barriers, distrust, or repeated vaccination demands (World Health Organization,2024e).
The effectiveness of educational interventions in addressing vaccine hesitancy and refusal highlights their critical role in global vaccination efforts (Kaul et al.,2019; Murmann et al.,2023; Quinn et al.,2023).
Theory‐based educational interventions, particularly those grounded in behavioral change theories, such as the Health Belief Model (HBM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), and the socio‐ecological model, have demonstrated promising efficacy compared to non‐theory‐based educational interventions in promoting sustained vaccine intention and uptake (Li et al.,2022; Limbu et al.,2022; Limbu & Gautam,2023).
However, most theory‐based educational interventions were standardized and one‐size‐fits‐all.
There are concerns that such approaches may not realistically represent an individual's journey for behavioral change and could be less consistent with the capabilities of current technologies, such as digital health and artificial‐intelligence‐enabled health interventions, which offer opportunities for personalized and adaptive interventions (Lustria et al.,2009; Noar et al.,2007).
The SOC offers a tailored stage‐based approach to behavior change, according to an individual's readiness for change (Noar et al.,2007).
As the most commonly used stage model, SOC postulates that completed behavioral change will go through five ordinal stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (Prochaska & Velicer,1997) (Figure1).
In the context of vaccination, individuals in the pre‐contemplation stage do not consider vaccination within the next 6 months and may be unaware of its importance (Norcross et al.,2011).
Those in the contemplation stage are thinking about getting vaccinated in the next 6 months but have not committed to taking action (Norcross et al.,2011).
The preparation stage includes those planning to get vaccinated the next month and may have taken initial steps, such as scheduling an appointment (Norcross et al.,2011).
The action stage refers to individuals who have recently been vaccinated within the past 6 months and are focused on completing the series, if applicable (Norcross et al.,2011).
Finally, the maintenance stage involves sustaining vaccination behavior for over 6 months, including ensuring that booster doses are received (Norcross et al.,2011).
SOC suggests that interventions must be tailored to an individual's current stage to promote sustained behavioral change (Prochaska & Velicer,1997).
For example, individuals in the pre‐contemplation stage may need interventions focused on raising awareness of vaccination benefits.
In contrast, individuals in the action or maintenance stages may need support to reinforce their commitment and maintain vaccination uptake (Raihan & Cogburn,2024).
SOC‐tailored interventions refer to the tailoring of messages and strategies to target the audience's current SOC.
SOC‐tailored interventions enhance engagement (Richert et al.,2011) and motivation (Sacco et al.,2023), leading to higher vaccination uptake, defined as the actual receipt of a vaccine, and greater vaccination intention, defined as the willingness or plan to get vaccinated, compared with standard and non‐SOC‐tailored interventions that often overlook these nuances (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
While vaccination intention reflects an individual's readiness to act, vaccination uptake represents the culmination of that intention into action.
SOC‐tailored interventions are particularly effective because they address psychological and contextual barriers at each SOC, facilitating the transition from intention to actual uptake.
Additionally, SOC‐tailored interventions can address psychological barriers, such as vaccine hesitancy, more effectively by gradually moving individuals from contemplation to action, a process not typically accounted for in standard and non‐SOC‐tailored interventions (Raihan & Cogburn,2024).
SOC‐tailored interventions have been extensively applied and demonstrated varying and consistent levels of effectiveness in promoting various health behaviors (Acharya et al.,2021; Imeri et al.,2022; Mastellos et al.,2014; Romain et al.,2018).
However, the impact of SOC‐tailored interventions on vaccination uptake has not been comprehensively explored through systematic reviews and meta‐analyses.
To bridge this knowledge gap, the present systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to assess the global evidence regarding the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions in promoting the uptake of a wide range of vaccines.
By addressing this gap, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of SOC‐tailored interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and refusal, informing the development of targeted strategies to improve vaccination uptake worldwide.
This systematic review and meta‐analysis were registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024586019) and conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guidelines.
We searched the MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, and APA Psyclnfo databases for studies published before August 12, 2024, in any country or setting.
Keywords were selected based on the PICOS (participants, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study) criteria to address the research question (whereP= general population;I= educational interventions tailored to individual participants' current SOC;C= none;O= uptake, intention, or attitudes related to any type of vaccination; andS= randomized controlled trial [RCT] or quasi‐experimental or single‐arm pre‐post or post‐test only studies).
The Boolean operator was used in the search strategy, with “OR” and/or “AND” used to link search terms.
Keywords and MeSH terms related to SOC, vaccination behavior, and attitudes were used.
Details of the search strategies are provided in Appendix1.
We established clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, which are summarized in Table1.
To ensure methodological rigor, we excluded gray literature (e.g., conference abstracts, government reports, textbooks, unpublished dissertations, and preprints) because of variability in quality and the absence of rigorous peer‐review processes.
By focusing on peer‐reviewed journal articles, the review aimed to synthesize robust and credible evidence on the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions.
The exposure categories and outcomes of this study are presented inTextbox 1.
Exposure categories and outcomes included in the review of the application of the SOC in promoting vaccination.
The National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies, with different versions of the tools applied based on the study design (National Institutes of Health,2022).
A 14‐item tool was used for controlled intervention studies, whereas a 12‐item tool was used for single‐arm pre–post studies.
Study quality was assessed on the basis of scores ranging from poor to good, with higher scores indicating better quality.
Controlled intervention studies were classified as poor (0–4), fair (5–10), or good (11–14), whereas single‐arm pre–post studies were categorized as poor (0–3), fair (4–8), or good (9–12).
Higher scores indicate better study quality.
The quality assessment results informed the synthesis process and sensitivity analyses in several ways.
First, studies categorized as poor quality were excluded from the meta‐analysis to ensure the robustness of the findings.
Second, sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing one study at a time to assess the robustness of the pooled effect estimates.
Quality assessment findings provided a framework for interpreting the sensitivity analyses, ensuring that variations in the overall findings could be attributed to study characteristics or quality differences.
Two independent reviewers (SC and SW) screened titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles for eligibility using a standardized data extraction form (Table2) to collect information on study characteristics (e.g., first author, publication year, country, study design, sample size, and study population), vaccination type, and SOC‐tailored intervention details.
Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a senior reviewer (ZW).
Because of heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was performed to summarize the characteristics and findings of the included studies, with key data tabulated and intervention effects on vaccination outcomes.
Summary of findings in application of SOC‐tailored interventions to increase vaccination attitudes/behaviors.
We used random effects models to conduct the meta‐analysis, combined data, and calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for both RCTs and quasi‐experimental designs.
Hedge'sgwas used to estimate the SMDs to remove bias because of the varying sample sizes of the included studies (Deeks & Higgins,2010).
The significance threshold was set atp< .05.
Following conventional benchmarks (Cohen,2013; Hedges & Olkin,2014), SMD (95% CI) values were categorized as trivial (0.00–0.19), small (0.20–0.49), medium (0.50–0.79), or large (≥0.80).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing one study at a time, to assess the robustness of the overall findings.
Subgroup analyses were carried out to examine how demographic factors may affect the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions.
A random‐effects model was used to account for between‐study variability and to explore differential impacts across study populations (children vs. older adults ≥65 years).
TheQstatistic was used to assess homogeneity of effect size, with significance defined asp< .05 (Cochran,1954), while theI2statistic quantified the degree of heterogeneity, categorized as small (<25%), medium (25%–75%), or large (>75%) (Higgins et al.,2003).
We used visual inspection to assess the asymmetry of funnel plots and the Egger test to detect potential publication bias (Irwig et al.,1998).
Additionally, the trim‐and‐fill method was used to estimate the true effect size adjusted for potential publication bias, and the number of studies needed to balance the funnel plot (Duval & Tweedie,2000).
All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.2) with themetaforpackage.
The initial database search yielded 125,471 citations.
After removing 77,294 duplicates, 48,177 articles were subjected to title and abstract screening.
Of these, 48,094 articles were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria.
The remaining 83 articles underwent a full‐text review, and 78 were subsequently excluded because they did not fulfill the selection criteria.
A final number of five studies were included in this systematic review and meta‐analysis.
A PRISMA flow diagram detailing the study selection process is shown in Figure2.
Flowchart of selection of included studies reporting the stage‐of‐change (SOC) in promoting vaccination.
Five studies published between 2004 and 2023 were included in the systematic review (Table2) (Denison et al.,2023; Gagneur et al.,2018; Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021).
Two studies were conducted before 2020 (before the COVID‐19 pandemic) and three were conducted after 2020.
The majority of the studies (n= 4) were conducted in North America, with one each in the Asia‐Pacific region (n= 1).
In terms of study design, three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021), one was single‐arm post‐test study (Denison et al.,2023), and one used a quasi‐experimental design (Gagneur et al.,2018).
The total sample size was 8080.
The participants included 1457 adults aged 65 years or older, 2389 mothers of newborn infants (neonates), 956 parents of adolescents aged 9–17 years, and 3278 adults.
The included studies used SOC‐tailored interventions to promote COVID‐19 vaccination (n= 1) (Denison et al.,2023), human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination (n= 1) (Wynn et al.,2021), SIV (n = 1) (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023), routine childhood vaccination (n= 1) (Gagneur et al.,2018), and pneumococcal vaccination (n= 1) (Quinley & Shih,2004).
The overall quality of the three RCTs and one quasi‐experimental study was between fair and good.
As a result, all these four studies were retained for the meta‐analysis.
In addition, one single‐arm post study was rated as fair.
The details of the quality assessment are provided in Appendices2and3.
SOC‐tailored interventions were delivered through a range of platforms (Table2), including a chatbot integrated with an instant messaging application (WhatsApp) (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023), SMS text messages (Wynn et al.,2021), mass media channels (Denison et al.,2023), telephone (Quinley & Shih,2004), and face‐to‐face counseling (Gagneur et al.,2018).
Four studies assessed participants' SOC prior to delivering the interventions, emphasizing the importance of aligning interventions with participants' SOC to influence vaccination behaviors (Textbox 2).
Of these, two studies measured SOC only once before the implementation of any intervention or at the beginning of the first intervention session without further assessments during the following intervention sessions (Gagneur et al.,2018; Wynn et al.,2021).
In contrast, two studies conducted repeated SOC assessments before each intervention session, enabling more tailored and responsive interventions (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
Three studies used project staff to assess SOC through telephone surveys (n= 1) (Quinley & Shih,2004), face‐to‐face interviews (n= 1) (Gagneur et al.,2018), and SMS (n= 1) (Wynn et al.,2021).
One study used a chatbot to automatically assess SOC at the beginning of each intervention session through WhatsApp (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
Characteristics of SOC‐tailored interventions in included studies.
The frequency and duration of the intervention sessions varied considerably across the studies.
One study (n= 1) involved a single 20‐min motivational interviewing session with new mothers (Gagneur et al.,2018), while three others (n= 3) involved multiple sessions spread over weeks or months (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021).
For instance, one study used a chatbot to deliver four intervention sessions every 2 weeks, each providing educational messages tailored to the participant's current SOC (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
Another study used follow‐up telephone calls over a 3‐month period to deliver SOC‐tailored educational information aimed at improving vaccination uptake (Quinley & Shih,2004).
Four experimental studies included control groups to evaluate the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions (Gagneur et al.,2018; Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021).
The control groups were classified into two categories: those receiving standard and non‐SOC‐tailored interventions (n= 3) (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021) and those receiving no intervention at all (n= 1) (Gagneur et al.,2018).
For example, in one study, the control group received generic health promotion messages and standard SMS reminders about HPV vaccination without any SOC‐tailored content (Wynn et al.,2021).
In contrast, another study compared SOC‐tailored interventions with a control group that did not receive any individual educational sessions, providing evidence of the impact of SOC‐tailored interventions versus no intervention (Gagneur et al.,2018) (Textbox 2).
Our meta‐analysis included four experimental studies that assessed the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions for increasing vaccination uptake (Table3and Figure3).
Of these, three RCTs were included: one examined the impact of SOC‐tailored interventions on pneumococcal vaccination, one on HPV vaccination, and one on SIV (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021), and one quasi‐experimental study examined childhood vaccinations (Gagneur et al.,2018).
The meta‐analysis revealed a statistically significant improvement in vaccination uptake among participants who received SOC‐tailored interventions (p< .001).
Based on the analysis (intervention:n= 2440 and control:n= 1850), the pooled SMD of overall uptake was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.59), and no evidence of heterogeneity was found (I2= 0%,p= .88).
Note: SMD: Standardized mean difference comparing the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions with non‐SOC tailored interventions; SMD values were categorized as trivial (0.00–0.19), small (0.20–0.49), medium (0.50–0.79), and large (≥0.80).
I2:I2statistic quantified the degree of heterogeneity, categorized as small (<25%), medium (25%–75%), or large (>75%).
Egger's test: Assessed the presence of publication bias by testing the significance of the funnel plot asymmetry.
Trim‐and‐fill: Adjusts meta‐analysis effect estimates for the impact of publication bias.
Adjusted SMD: Adjusted SMD by trim‐and‐fill method.
SMD, standard mean difference; SOC, stages of change.
Forest plot of the effect of SOC‐tailored interventions on promoting vaccination uptake: (a) vaccination uptake among all participants; (b) vaccination uptake among children; and (c) vaccination uptake among older adults aged ≥65 years.
Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the following study populations: (1) vaccination among children and (2) vaccination among older adults aged ≥65 years.
The results of subgroup analyses showed that SOC‐tailored interventions targeting parents or caregivers were effective in increasing vaccination uptake among children (pooled SMD = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.74,p= .02,I2= 0%,p= .66).
Moreover, such interventions were effective in increasing vaccination uptake among older adults aged ≥65 years (pooled SMD = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.92,p= .03,I2= 0%,p= .65).
By evaluating outcomes across diverse subpopulations, these subgroup analyses provide valuable insights for designing more targeted and efficient public health interventions (Liu et al.,2019; Paquette et al.,2019).
Furthermore, subgroup analyses assist in identifying potential sources of heterogeneity, ensuring that the findings are nuanced and better reflect the variability observed in real‐world settings (Cuijpers et al.,2021; Paquette et al.,2019).
One non‐experimental study was excluded from the meta‐analysis (Denison et al.,2023).
This study implemented a public education campaign utilizing SOC to enhance COVID‐19 vaccination uptake in the United States.
The results indicated that an SOC‐tailored educational campaign to promote vaccination was associated with a significant increase in the COVID‐19 vaccination uptake (β= 0.005;p= .03).
Publication bias was visualized using funnel plots, Egger's test, and trim‐and‐fill method (Table3and Figure4).
The relatively small number of included studies might affect the reliability of publication bias analysis.
Among the existing evidence, Egger's test did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of publication bias (p= .82) in studies reporting SOC‐tailored interventions to increase vaccination uptake (Irwig et al.,1998) (Table3).
Furthermore, the trim‐and‐fill method, which adds hypothetical studies to adjust for potential asymmetry in funnel plots, resulted in a slightly revised effect size for vaccination uptake (SMD, 0.53; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.58).
However, because of the limited number of studies (n= 2) reporting SOC‐tailored interventions to promote vaccination among children and older adults aged ≥65 years, we were unable to apply Egger's test and trim‐and‐fill method for assessing publication bias in the subgroup analyses.
Funnel plot for assessing the publication bias among the included studies: (a) vaccination uptake among all participants; (b) vaccination uptake among children; and (c) vaccination uptake among older adults ≥65 years.
Sensitivity analyses consistently demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in vaccination uptake among participants receiving SOC‐tailored interventions after excluding one study at each time (Bown & Sutton,2010; Chen et al.,2024).
When the study (Quinley & Shih,2004) was excluded, the pooled SMD for overall uptake was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.63,p= .002,I2= 0%,p= .72).
Excluding the study (Gagneur et al.,2018) had a pooled SMD of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.67,p= .003,I2= 0%,p= .72).
Similarly, the exclusion of the study (Wynn et al.,2021) resulted in a pooled SMD of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.61,p< .001,I2= 0%,p= .83), and excluding the study (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023) produced a pooled SMD of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.59,p< .001,I2= 0%,p= .89).
Egger's test did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of publication bias (p= .29 to .98) across the sensitivity analyses (Irwig et al.,1998).
The application of the trim‐and‐fill method led to slight adjustments in the effect sizes after the exclusion of each study.
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the pooled effect estimates, with minimal changes observed in the overall effect size.
Quality assessment findings supported this robustness, as the removal of studies rated as fair quality did not substantially alter the results, confirming the reliability of the findings.
Moreover, studies rated as good quality had a more consistent influence on the pooled estimates, further reinforcing the importance of quality in interpreting the overall results.
The detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Appendix4.
Two studies provided insights into participant engagement, adherence, and satisfaction with SOC‐tailored interventions (Gagneur et al.,2018; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
In the study by Wang et al. (2023), the participants who received chatbot‐delivered SOC‐tailored interventions demonstrated higher completion rates for at least one episode of intervention than those in the control group, who received chatbot‐delivered non‐SOC‐tailored interventions (77.3% vs. 62.6%,p< .001) (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
Additionally, approximately 80% of the participants in the SOC‐tailored intervention group reported ease of interaction with the intervention and satisfaction with health promotion messages (Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
Similarly, Gagneur et al. (2018) observed that 84.9% (1128/1329) of the participants in an SOC‐tailored intervention group completed the intervention, and the overall feasibility of SOC‐tailored educational sessions was 93% (1243/1329) (Gagneur et al.,2018).
Addressing vaccine hesitancy is a critical public health priority as it contributes to suboptimal vaccination uptake globally, leading to outbreaks of vaccine‐preventable diseases.
While previous educational interventions grounded in behavioral change theories such as the HBM, TPB, and SCT have shown some success, they do not fully capture the dynamic and individualized nature of behavioral change (Prochaska et al.,1994).
SOC offers a more tailored approach by targeting an individual's readiness for behavior change (Prochaska & Velicer,1997), which could lead to more sustained improvements in vaccination uptake (Kenzig & Mumford,2022).
However, no systematic review or meta‐analysis has summarized their effectiveness in promoting vaccinations.
Our study fills this gap by providing a comprehensive synthesis of evidence on the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions for vaccination uptake.
Our study synthesized data from five studies, four of which were included in the meta‐analysis, to assess the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions on vaccine uptake.
The results demonstrated a significant medium effect size (pooled SMD of 0.54), indicating that SOC‐tailored interventions significantly enhanced vaccine uptake.
Subgroup analyses further showed that these effects were similar across sub‐populations.
The absence of heterogeneity (I2= 0%) indicates a consistent effect of SOC‐tailored interventions on vaccination uptake, suggesting that any observed variation between studies is likely because of chance rather than differences in intervention designs or study populations (Higgins et al.,2003).
This consistency strengthens the reliability of the results and is further supported by the lack of publication bias, which reinforces the robustness of the findings (Ahmed et al.,2012).
By employing rigorous sensitivity analyses and including studies with varied methodological backgrounds, we ensured the methodological rigor of the study (Bown & Sutton,2010).
Given that vaccine hesitancy is an evolving global issue, this evidence provides timely support for integrating SOC‐tailored interventions into large‐scale public‐health strategies.
All of the included studies were conducted in developed countries or regions (North American and Hong Kong), and there are hence concerns about the applicability of the findings to low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs).
As compared to developed countries or regions, informational interventions promoting vaccination in LMICs face more challenges, such as cultural beliefs and some structural barriers (e.g., limited resources to implement health promotion, inadequate access to health care and transportation, and financial constraints) (de Figueiredo et al.,2020; Simas & Larson,2021).
Therefore, SOC‐tailored interventions should couple with efforts addressing the aforementioned structural barriers in LMICs (e.g., mobile vaccination units, financial incentives, and employer‐supported vaccination leave) (Simas & Larson,2021).
Using SOC‐tailored interventions alone might not be an effective approach.
In addition, SOC‐tailored interventions should integrate localized messaging through trusted community channels, such as religious and local leaders, to improve receptivity and engagement (Simas & Larson,2021).
Integrating SOC‐tailored interventions into health‐care systems requires careful consideration of cost, workforce capacity, and implementation feasibility.
Training health‐care providers in SOC‐tailored interventions is essential for ensuring effective delivery while minimizing the burden on strained health‐care infrastructures.
Leveraging digital and low‐cost technologies can offer scalable and cost‐effective alternatives, particularly in digitally underserved populations (Eze et al.,2021; Siddiqi et al.,2024).
Additionally, embedding SOC‐tailored interventions into existing public health programs can optimize resource use and improve sustainability.
Future research should evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of different SOC‐tailored interventions and identify strategies to streamline integration within diverse health‐care settings, ultimately improving global vaccine equity.
Another challenge in SOC‐tailored intervention is tracking participants' evolving SOC for different vaccines (Brug et al.,2005; Raihan & Cogburn,2024).
For example, individuals may reach the “maintenance” stage for one vaccine (e.g., SIV) but at earlier stages for new vaccines or boosters for different pathogens (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,2024; He et al.,2023).
Chatbots offer a promising solution by providing real‐time, personalized support that adjusts to users' readiness levels (Passanante et al.,2023; Siddiqi et al.,2024).
Their ability to continuously assess and adapt interventions based on SOC progression enhances their effectiveness in overcoming logistical barriers.
Our meta‐analysis suggests that SOC‐tailored interventions significantly increase vaccine uptake, further supporting the potential of chatbots as scalable and cost‐effective tools in vaccination campaigns.
Additionally, chatbots' scalability and cost‐effectiveness make them valuable tools for large‐scale vaccination campaigns, especially in resource‐limited areas (Lee et al.,2023; Passanante et al.,2023).
Their proven success in other health domains, such as mental health (Kim,2024), physical activity (Xue et al.,2023), chronic illness management (Kurniawan et al.,2024), and HIV self‐testing (Chen et al.,2023), underscores their adaptability to vaccination efforts.
Given the increasing global reliance on digital health interventions, further research is required to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness and scalability of chatbot‐delivered SOC interventions in various vaccination programs.
Subgroup analyses highlighted the broad applicability of SOC‐tailored interventions.
For parents or caregivers, such interventions effectively address vaccine concerns, leading to increased childhood and HPV vaccination uptake for their children (Gagneur et al.,2018; Wynn et al.,2021).
The personalization offered by SOC‐tailored interventions is particularly critical for parents or caregivers, as their attitudes and concerns significantly influence their decisions to vaccinate their children.
Parents or caregivers who are hesitant to vaccinate themselves may similarly resist vaccinating their children (Dong et al.,2023; Lin, Chen, Su, Chen, et al.,2024; Lin, Chen, Su, Liao, et al.,2024).
Studies have shown that parental vaccine hesitancy exists across a continuum that may require interactive communication with health‐care professionals who can both assess their hesitancy level and readiness to vaccinate their children and motivate them to subsequently take action (Jin et al.,2023; Leask et al.,2012).
SOC‐tailored interventions offer a personalized, stage‐specific approach that mimics the essential functions of interactive health‐care communications, addresses these concerns, and guides parents or caregivers through the SOC, effectively reducing vaccine hesitancy and promoting uptake for their children.
In addition, SOC‐tailored interventions were effective for older adults over 65 years, particularly in increasing the uptake of pneumococcal vaccination and SIV (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
This subpopulation is at a greater risk of vaccine fatigue and misconceptions of infection risks and vaccines, especially regarding annual vaccines (Chan, Lee, et al.,2023; Chia & Hartanto,2021).
SOC‐tailored approaches can mitigate these barriers by offering motivating cues and tailored encouragement to adhere to vaccine schedules (Oyebode et al.,2021).
The adaptability of SOC‐tailored interventions offers a promising strategy for addressing vaccine fatigue in older populations, which remains a critical concern, given the ongoing need for booster vaccines and evolving immunization schedules.
The findings of this review align with broader evidence on SOC interventions in other health behavior domains, such as smoking cessation and physical activity, where stage‐specific approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing behavior‐specific barriers (Ravi et al.,2021; Romain et al.,2018).
Similarly, the included studies showed that SOC‐tailored interventions effectively improve vaccination uptake by addressing vaccine‐specific concerns, such as safety and misinformation.
Innovations such as repeated SOC assessments, observed in two studies, enhance tailoring precision and align with successful strategies in other health domains (Quinley & Shih,2004; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
Moreover, the use of digital platforms, including chatbots, highlights the scalability and cost‐effectiveness of SOC interventions, making them particularly relevant for resource‐limited settings (Michie et al.,2017; Oyebode et al.,2021; Sediva et al.,2022).
These findings underscore the adaptability of SOC interventions and their potential for promoting sustainable health behaviors in diverse contexts.
While this study provides valuable insights, some limitations should be acknowledged.
First, because of the limited number of included studies in this review, comparable data were limited, whereas a large heterogeneity was observed.
Thus, findings of this study need cautious interpretation and should be considered as preliminary evidence for the effect of SOC‐tailored interventions in promoting vaccination uptake.
Second, the included studies varied in design, with unbalanced reporting of participant demographics, and were susceptible to reporting bias.
Third, the limited number of studies with long‐term follow‐up assessments restricts our ability to evaluate the sustained effects of SOC‐tailored interventions over time.
Future research should evaluate the long‐term impact of these interventions in promoting vaccination.
Fourth, the inherent limitations of the SOC framework should be acknowledged.
The blurred boundaries between stages and the differing reasons individuals progress through or remain in each stage create uncertainty about the effectiveness of tailored information.
These challenges may hinder the ability to provide precise, tailored interventions and impact the effectiveness of SOC‐based strategies.
Furthermore, the geographic concentration of the included studies in North America limits the generalizability of the findings to other regions, particularly in LMICs where vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, and perceptions may differ significantly.
Expanding SOC‐tailored interventions through cost‐effective digital health solutions has the potential to reduce global disparities in vaccine uptake.
In addition, two included studies relied on self‐reported vaccination data, which introduced potential recall and social desirability biases.
Another three studies used objective verification, such as extracting vaccination data from local Health Departments or uploading vaccination records (Gagneur et al.,2018; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023; Wynn et al.,2021).
Moreover, the effectiveness of SOC‐tailored interventions is supported by high participant engagement and satisfaction (Gagneur et al.,2018; Z. Wang, Chan, et al.,2023).
However, beyond adherence metrics, limited research has explored how specific SOC stages or message types drive behavior change.
Future studies should use mixed‐methods approaches to integrate qualitative insights on participant experiences, perceived barriers, and preferences with quantitative assessments to identify the most impactful intervention components and optimize SOC‐tailored interventions across diverse populations and health‐care settings.
Finally, although vaccine attitudes were included as a search term, none of the included studies reported attitudes as an outcome.
This represents a gap in the literature, as understanding vaccine attitudes is critical for addressing vaccine hesitancy comprehensively.
Future research should investigate how SOC‐tailored interventions influence vaccine attitudes alongside uptake.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta‐analysis demonstrate that SOC‐tailored interventions are effective in promoting vaccine uptake by addressing individuals' readiness for behavioral change.
These interventions provide a flexible and scalable approach for practitioners to tackle vaccine hesitancy, offering delivery methods ranging from digital tools like chatbots and SMS to in‐person counseling.
By tailoring interventions to specific stages of readiness, practitioners can address barriers such as misinformation and low motivation more effectively.
This study highlights the need for practitioner‐friendly guidelines to implement SOC‐based strategies, particularly in non‐Western and resource‐limited settings.
Integrating these approaches into global vaccination campaigns has the potential to significantly improve public health outcomes by increasing vaccination uptake, reducing vaccine‐preventable diseases, and fostering trust in vaccination efforts worldwide.
