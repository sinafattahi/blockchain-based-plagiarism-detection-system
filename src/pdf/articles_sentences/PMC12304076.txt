Diabetic foot deformities such as claw toes are debilitating complications.
It has been generally accepted that this results from atrophy of the intrinsic foot muscles (IFMs), despite this relationship being underexplored.
However, recent diagnostic imaging studies are finding some associations between diabetic intrinsic foot muscles and foot deformity.
This new information requires a thorough review of the evidence.
Our aim is to systematically review the current literature to investigate any associations between diabetic foot deformity and intrinsic foot muscle changes and review their significance.
Electronic databases Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched on 6 May 2020 for all years until 2020.
The search was re‐run on 26 June 2023 with dates ranging from 2020–2023.
Human data studies on adults in English, investigating diabetes, foot deformities and intrinsic foot muscles were included for review.
PROSPERO registration was approved on 24 July 2020.
Eleven papers out of 1779 met the inclusion criteria.
For the updated search, two papers out of the 226 met inclusion criteria.
All were assessed for quality using the STROBE criteria and the Newcastle and Ottawa Scale.
Six reported various correlations between intrinsic foot muscles and claw/hammer toe deformity measurements.
Three papers reported limited or no associations.
Three papers investigated medial column deformity (MCD); two found a significant correlation to intrinsic foot muscle atrophy.
Overall, there is a weak association between diabetic foot deformity and intrinsic foot muscle atrophy and intermuscular adipose tissue infiltration.

Our aim is to systematically review the current literature to investigate any associations between diabetic foot deformity and intrinsic foot muscle changes.
Overall, there is a weak association between diabetic foot deformity and intrinsic foot muscle atrophy and intermuscular adipose tissue infiltration.
The global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 588.7 million individuals in 2024 [1], including 2 million Australians in 2024 [2].
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the presence of peripheral nerve dysfunction, affecting up to 50% of adult diabetics and is associated with lower limb complications [3] including ulcerations, trauma and ischaemia, which are leading causes of infection, hospitalisation and amputation [4].
The intrinsic foot muscles (IFMs) play an integral role in foot stability, important in diabetic feet [5].
Muscle weakness and atrophy, associated with the severity of DPN, is due to progressive nerve axonal degeneration [6].
Compounding this, muscle quality is also degraded by excessive intermuscular adipose tissue infiltration (IMAT), reducing strength, muscle power and physical function [7].
Further complications are foot deformities including Charcot arthropathy, pes planus, hallux valgus, prominent metatarsal heads and claw and hammer toes [8], with claw toes being the most common.
Claw toes are defined as hyperextension of the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) with flexed proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJ), whereas hammer toes are characterised by an extended MTPJ, flexed PIPJ joint and a hyperextended DIPJ [9].
Another deformity, medial column deformity (MCD), involves the calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuneiforms and the first to third metatarsals, causing collapse of the arch of the foot [10].
Each year diabetes‐related foot disease affects approximately 50,000 Australians.
One of the key risk factors is foot deformity [11].
Concerningly, claw/hammer toes and MCDs are associated with an increased risk of foot ulceration and amputation [12,13].
The traditionally accepted theory of claw and hammer toe deformities is that of a ‘muscular imbalance’ [9,14,15], which is defined as a lack of parity between corresponding agonist and antagonist muscles in a muscle group [16].
A pathological muscle imbalance occurs when the imbalance of the muscles begins to inhibit function and ultimately leads to joint dysfunction [16].
In the case of claw and hammer toes, metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the foot become unstable due to weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles [17,18,19].
This destabilisation of joints is proposed to cause the proximal phalanx to hyperextend and the distal phalanx to flex resulting in claw or hammer toe deformity.
Despite this mechanism being widely accepted and referenced in papers to date, there are only observational studies which lack experimental data to validate the theory.
Some imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have cast doubt on this theory.
Bus et al. [17] found that muscle imbalance, assessed using a muscle atrophy score they developed [13,17] and measured with a reliable MRI method to distinguish between muscle and fat, was i) not significantly different between neuropathic patients with and without deformity, and ii) not significantly correlated with the degree of toe deformity (r= −0.14).
However, Bus et al. [13] only report the reliability of this method for IFM atrophy.
The reliability of the extrinsic muscle atrophy score was not reported.
Further intrinsic muscle atrophy scores were assessed but only intra‐observer rater reliability was established via weighted Kappa.
In contrast, Cheuy et al. [10] found an overall correlation between IFM deterioration and second MTPJ hyperextension for DPN participants with MCD (r= −0.51,p= 0.01), using plain radiography and MRI.
Similarly, Cheuy et al. [20] found that less forefoot lean muscle tissue was associated with greater MTPJ deformity for participants with DPN (r= −0.52,p< 0.01).
Allan et al.’s [21] literature review reported that IFM atrophy was present in participants with diabetes and correlated with DPN.
Yet, IFM atrophy did not appear to be closely correlated with the incidence of toe deformity in diabetes [21].
However, more recent papers have also found statistically significant correlations between IFM atrophy and MTPJ extension [19,22].

An additional search was run on 17 January 2025 for papers between 2023 and 2025 that resulted in no additional texts for inclusion.
After removal of duplicates, the main reviewer (TH) screened all titles and abstracts, which were also assessed by equal distribution to three independent reviewers (LR, PL and JC).
Each reviewer provided a reason for exclusion or inclusion as demonstrated in Figure2.
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
Full text eligibility screening was conducted by TH and LR and disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (PL or JC).
One author was contacted requesting clarification on data and another requesting a full paper of a conference abstract; both responded with the required information.
STROBE [23] provided a preliminary quality assessment.
The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess quality and risk of bias [24].
As all included papers were cross‐sectional studies, an adapted version was used [25].
Results are demonstrated in Table1.
Studies scoring a total of eight or seven points were ranked as low risk of bias, six points medium and five points or less indicated a high risk of bias.
Data extraction was conducted by the main reviewer (TH).
Demographics extracted included study characteristics, type of diabetes, types of deformity, methods of measurements and analysis.
Because of the heterogeneity of the data, a meta‐analysis was not possible, so a qualitative analysis was conducted.
Factors analysed in each study were quality, participant characteristics, methods of measuring neuropathy, IFMs and foot deformity.
Statistical results were analysed for any associations between IFMs and foot deformity and their significance.
A total of 2877 records were retrieved.

Eleven full papers were deemed eligible for inclusion and data extraction.
Two hundred and twenty‐six records were retrieved by the updated 2023 database search; two were deemed eligible for inclusion (Figures2and3).
Quality assessment scores are demonstrated in Table1.
Scores ranged from 2 to 6 with a mean of 4.
One paper achieved a score of 6 with a medium risk of bias [19].
All other papers scored 5 or below with a high risk of bias.
The lowest performing categories were sample size and non‐respondents.
One paper provided a justification of sample size and a power calculation [20].
No papers provided insight to participant retainment, dropout and how that data would have been used.
The highest performing categories were comparability and assessment of outcomes.
All papers controlled for age and sex and most papers assessed data using blinded independent raters.
Participant characteristics are demonstrated in Table2.
The total number of participants from the 13 studies was 1325.
Sixty‐five were healthy controls, 13 were diabetics with no peripheral neuropathy and 182 were diabetics with peripheral neuropathy.
One thousand and sixty‐five were diabetic participants, but neuropathic status was either not measured or recorded.
The sample size of all studies ranged from 2 to 1065 participants with a median of 34.
Ages ranged from 27 to 80 years with a control group mean of 53.8 years, diabetes mellitus (DM) with no peripheral neuropathy with the mean of 56.1 years, and diabetes with peripheral neuropathy with the mean of 58.9 years.
The mean diabetes duration for the DM only group was 12.6 years and for diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy (DMPN) group was 19.8 years.
Ten participants with diabetes mellitus without neuropathy had a recorded foot deformity and none had a history of ulceration.
One hundred and forty three DMPN participants had a recorded foot deformity and 29 had a history of ulceration.
One study reported 2040 feet with deformity but did not subclassify them into having DM only or DMPN [26].
For MRI reference only, age‐matched ± 5 years to experiment groups.

Included measurement methods are demonstrated in Table3.
Nine papers tested for neuropathic status.
Ten used the inability to detect a 5.07 (10g) Semmes–Weinstein monofilament at testing sites to determine neuropathic status [10,17,19,20,22,27,28,29,30,31].
Three tested the motor nerve conduction velocity of the peroneal nerve [17,27,32].
Three used the Michigan neuropathy screening instrument (score > 2) to indicate the presence of neuropathy [22,31,32] and one used the neuropathy symptoms score [32].
Categories included normal, mild atrophy (0–1, < 25% fatty infiltration of the muscle), moderate (2%, 26%–50%) and severe (3, > 50%).
Abbreviations: DIPJ, distal interphalangeal joint; MNCV, motor nerve conduction velocity; MNSI, Michigan neuropathy screening instrument; MTPJ, metatarsophalangeal joint; PIPJ, proximal interphalangeal joint; TMTJ, tarso‐metatartarsal joint; VPT, vibration perception threshold.
Nine studies used MRI, and three used CT (Table3).
One study used physical examination of the IFMs [26].
One study measured the intrinsic foot muscles as a whole [32].
Five papers measured all the IFMs from the forefoot to the hindfoot [10,22,28,29,31].
Three papers assessed the IFMs in the forefoot.
Bus et al. [27] did not measure specific IFMs but performed a visual analysis of the IFMs at the level of the head of the fifth metatarsal [27].
Bus et al. [17], measured IFMs using an anatomically referenced coronal image cutting through the fifth metatarsal head but did not identify specific IFMs except the interossei and lumbricals [17,20] and also did not measure specific muscles but performed a visual analysis of the IFMs of the forefoot from the second tarsometatarsal joint through to the sesamoids [20].
One paper measured the IFMs on the plantar surface of the foot [19].
One paper measured the Extensor Digitorum Brevis with palpation [26].
Two used the plantar soft tissue density under the midpart of the metatarsal shafts as a surrogate measurement for the IFMs using CT [30,33].
Papers that included healthy controls all reported IFM atrophy and/or deterioration in comparison to DM and in greater degrees for DMPN participants.
Three studies investigated MCD, two with physical examination only [10,28] and the other with physical examination and angular measurements on a lateral foot radiograph [29] (Table3).
Nine studies measured claw and/or hammer toe deformity using CT, MRI or physical assessment, with six only measuring MTPJ angle [17,20,22,30,33,34].
Measurement software tools were variable; however, Zellers et al. [22,31] and Hastings et al. [28] used the same MRI methods as Cheuy et al. [10].
One study used a Microscribe contact digitiser tool to measure both metatarsal and phalangeal joint angles [27].
Two studies used physical examination for classification [19,26].
A specific metatarsal angle defining claw or hammer toe deformity was only mentioned in one study [17]; all other papers did not state what measurement angles represented deformity.
In one study, no participant had claw/hammer toe deformity [32].
Results and conclusions of the included papers are demonstrated in Table4.
For papers which providedpvalues a published guide was used to determine the strengths of these values, and in order to consistently comparepvalue strengths between papers.
For correlation assessment,rvalues of 0–0.19 were considered very weak, 0.2–0.39 weak, 0.40–0.59 moderate, 0.6–0.79 strong and 0.8–1 very strong [35,36].
One study reported a moderate positive correlation between IFMs and claw/hammer toe deformity measurements (r= 0.58,p= 0.02) [30].
Two studies reported a weak positive correlation (r= 0.273,p< 0.05) [22]; however, Kimura et al. [19] did not provide anrvalue [19].
Two papers reported moderate inverse correlations (r= −0.52,p< 0.01) [20] (r= −0.266,p= 0.043) [31].
One paper found a very weak inverse relationship between IFM atrophy and toe deformity using an observer determined muscle atrophy score (r= −0.18,p= 0.44) [17].
Overall, associations had conflicting results.
Four papers measured both IFMs and foot deformity but did not assess for correlation [26,27,32,33].
20% increase in MRI qualitative score (IFM fat infiltration) DMN + MCD + compared to DMN + MCD− and 450% compared to controls.
27% decrease in Meary's angle DMN + MCD+ compared to DMN + MCD− and 5× increase compared to controls.
Intrinsic muscle atrophy increased plantar aponeurosis thickness, and neuropathy are all potentially related to the complex the development of claw toe deformity.
Abbreviations: DMN−, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy absent; DMN+, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy present; DMN + MCD−, diabetes mellitus, medial column deformity absent; DMN + MCD+, diabetes mellitus, medial column deformity present.
Two papers found a moderate inverse correlation between IFMs and MCD measurements; one positive (r= 0.51,p= 0.01) [29] and one inverse (r= −0.51,p= 0.01) [10] (Table4).
One stated that muscle scores were not significantly correlated with any radiographic alignment measures; however, nororpvalues were provided [28].
The primary aim of this systematic review was to investigate the relationships between the IFMs and diabetic foot deformity.
Despite some conflicting results, most studies found an association between IFM atrophy or deterioration and foot deformity.
However, they were generally weak, or only significant for participants with severe muscular atrophy.
A secondary aim was to explore the methods used to investigate this relationship; many measurement variations were reported.
Six of the 13 papers found either weak to moderate association between IFM atrophy or degradation and claw/hammer toe deformity [17,19,20,22,30,31] (Table4).
Four papers measured both claw/hammer toe deformity and IFMs but did not conduct a statistical analysis for correlations [26,27,32,33].
Despite an overall low to moderate association, some papers found that correlations became more significant in certain conditions.
Robertson et al. [30] observed that plantar foot muscle density was related to the bone density of the metatarsal heads [30].
Kimura et al. [19] found the presence of neuropathy was significantly associated with lower IFM volume only for those with claw toes [19].
Similarly, Zellers et al. [31] found the Michigan score and IFM deterioration combined accounted for 18% of toe extension variability [31].
This supports a more synergistic or additive model of IFMs and claw/hammer toe deformity.
The original theory of muscle imbalance resulting in foot deformity assumes, without experimental evidence, that atrophy results in weakness of the muscle.
However, a study examining the reliability and correlates of the cross‐sectional area (CSA) of Abductor Hallucis measured by US found a significant positive correlation between CSA of Abductor Hallucis and toe flexion strength measured by pedobarography (r= 0.562p= 0.012) supporting the idea that CSA is a surrogate measure of muscle strength [37].
A recent study by Kaszyk et al. [38] has reported that IFM volumes were correlated with midfoot function in gait in those with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
In this study, decreased total muscle volume measured with CT correlated with greater midfoot collapse during gait (r= −0.40,p= 0.02) [38].
In addition, the theory of imbalance states that the extensor digitorum longus is the primary antagonistic muscle against the IFMs resulting in claw and hammer toe deformity.
Bus et al. [17] provides experimental evidence against this theory; however, their methods did not accurately measure these involved muscle groups.
IFM atrophy was determined using one image slice through the fifth metatarsal head in the coronal plane and a proximal and distal score of the extensor digitorum longus to determine an extrinsic foot muscle atrophy score.
However, reliability of the extensor digitorum longus atrophy score was not reported and the use of the single image to determine IFM atrophy excludes the intrinsic foot muscles acting on the fifth toe and the muscle bellies of the flexor hallucis brevis and adductor hallucis, and omits the largest CSA of these muscles which are typically more distal in the forefoot [39,40].
In addition, given significant reduction of IFM CSAs are reported due to advancing age [41] it is possible that age influences the atrophy scores in Bus's [17] study, not just health status.
Thus, the theory of muscle imbalance of the extrinsic versus intrinsic foot muscles is at best simplistic.
Factors influencing the development of claw toes in patients with diabetes is likely complex and includes IFM atrophy, poor intrinsic and extrinsic muscle sequencing, and compromised extensor apparatus of the foot [42].
More specifically, toe clawing may involve extensor digitorum longus contractures causing MTPJ extension.
In addition, extensor digitorum brevis [43], lumbricals and interossei muscles can atrophy, limiting their ability to stabilise the MTPJs in a neutral position.
This is exacerbated by muscle deterioration, as evidenced by reduced volume and size in plantar IFMs [19,20,39].
This compromises flexion and control of the proximal interphalangeal joints.
Additionally, the flexor digitorum longus is likely to have contractures as part of the flexor apparatus of the foot [44].
Shortening of the flexor digitorum longus contributes to interphalangeal joint flexion and toe clawing as it attaches to the phalanges more distally than the flexor digitorum brevis, thereby straining the MTPJ stabilising ligaments of the extensor apparatus.
This demonstrates the complexity of possible mechanisms that may cause clawed toes in those with DPN [42,45].
Diabetic foot deformity is a multifactorial disease.
Three papers reported that ankle joint mobility is associated with claw/hammer toe deformity [20,22,29].
Insufficient stabilisation of the MTPJ by the IFMs may cause the extensor digitorum longus to shorten and produce hyperextension of the MTPJ, increasing reliance on the extrinsic foot muscles for gait and affecting ankle joint mobility [20].
Bus et al. [17] described how pathology of the plantar aponeurosis contributes to MTPJ instability and hyperextension of the plantar aponeurosis.
Zellers also found that bone mineral density is significantly associated with MTPJ deformity [22].
Kimura et al. [19] found a significant interaction between increased plantar aponeurosis thickness, neuropathy and claw toe status.
Therefore, these additional factors should be considered alongside the currently accepted factors that contribute to the development of foot deformity, including ligament contraction, inappropriate footwear and foot care.
An earlier literature review assessed three studies that investigated associations between IFMs and foot deformity [21].
They reported limited to no associations, whereas our review supports a weak to moderate association between IFM atrophy and the development of foot deformity.
This may be due to the complex interactions between the extrinsic and IFMs.
Cheuy et al. [18] recruited participants with MCD and found the correlation between MTPJ angle and IFM deterioration becomes more linear with increasing deterioration (Table4).
They suggest that a threshold effect, occurring at equal parts fat and muscle in the IFM compartment, is significantly associated with deformity.
Two studies, despite using the same measurement methods for IFMs and foot deformity found differing results; one study reported IFM deterioration and posterior tibialis tendon pathology were key predictors of medial column alignment and poor midfoot function in individuals with DMPN [29].
In contrast, Hastings et al. [28] found that DMPN + MCD had mild to moderate fatty atrophy of the IFMs, but not significantly correlated to MCD.
They found that a higher total bone score, including bone marrow oedema, new bone formation and subchondral cysts, was associated with increased severity of medial column deformity MCD [28].
It is unclear why there are conflicting results despite the same participant demographics and measurement methods.
MRI was used to investigate the IFMs for nine of the 13 papers and is optimal in evaluating soft tissue with high spatial resolution and image quality [46] (Table3).
One study reliably quantified intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volumes, including muscle and fat segmentation, with most interclass correlations (ICCs) over 0.95 and validity ofR2> 0.97 for all phantoms in their study [18].
MRI is an ideal choice for imaging the IFMs; however, there are contraindications for some patients with metal implants and claustrophobia, alongside high costs and long scanning times [46].
CT scans discriminate bone and muscle well, making it another appropriate tool for the assessment of IFMs [47].
One CT study [30] used the soft tissue density under the metatarsal shafts as a surrogate measure of IFMs, as there was difficulty in visualising and separating them from surrounding fat and tendons.
Another study [22] used CT as a measurement tool and segmented volumes for more accurate and reliable measurements of IFM atrophy [48].
However, CT may not be considered suitable as a screening tool because of the high levels of radiation dosage and relatively high cost [46].
Ledoux et al. [26, 26] used physical examination of the extensor digitorum brevis as a measure of IFM atrophy [49].
They found that atrophy can rarely be diagnosed unless the extensor digitorum brevis is completely or nearly absent.
Despite the test being easy to perform, it does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the IFMs and has subjective bias, which reduces accuracy of results.
None of the included papers used ultrasound (US) to measure or assess atrophy or degradation of the IFMs.
Atrophy of the IFMs determined by ultrasonography has been validated against MRI measurements [43].
Similarly, in a separate study measuring IFMs, Wang et al. [50] used high frequency US to show significant IFM atrophy in diabetic feet [50].
US has considerable promise as a screening tool for diabetic foot management as the benefits of no ionising radiation, low cost and widespread accessibility potentially outweigh lower spatial resolution and operator dependency [46].
The optimal modality for assessing musculoskeletal deformity is CT due to its superior cortical bone contrast and spatial resolution [46].
It can provide accurate and precise foot measurements for diabetic feet, enabling descriptions of internal and external structures [51].
However, the limitations of radiation dosage and relatively high cost apply.
The most common measurement of toe extension deformity by CT was the MTPJ angle [20,22,30,33].
Despite wide acceptance as a measure of the severity of claw and hammer toe deformity, with low bias and high reliability [52] (Table3), MTPJ angle does not distinguish between claw and hammer toe deformity.
This is because the proximal and interphalangeal joint angles are not assessed for flexion and extension and is a drawback to understanding the causes and progression of these deformities.
Bus et al. [27], was able to measure MTPJs, PIPJs and DIPJs using a Microscribe 3D digitiser, which was potentially able to provide a greater assessment of all the toe joint angles.
Even though CT measurements are considered the gold standard, 3D digitiser measures of MTPJ angle have been found to be highly correlated with CT measures, and are reliable and validated radiological measures [53].
Two papers [10,29], utilised plain radiographs for angular measurements in assessing foot deformity (Table3).
However, this may not be as reliable as CT, providing only a two‐dimensional representation with inherent superimposition of bony anatomy [10].
Hastings et al. [29], investigated specific measurements regarding MCD [10], focusing on Meary's angle.
This has been found to have lower precision than other radiographic bony measurements of foot alignment due to difficulties in measuring the talus [54].
This is important as Meary's angle is defined as the angle formed by the line bisecting the talar head and neck and the line through the longitudinal axis of the first metatarsal [29].
Yet, overall, it is an appropriate measure to assess MCD as part of a comprehensive assessment that examines medial and longitudinal arch alignment [55].
All the papers included within this review were cross‐sectional studies thus a cause‐and‐effect relationship cannot be determined.
All studies except Ledoux et al. [26] had small sample sizes, which may impact external validity and the power of the results.
A meta‐analysis was also not possible, as the data were not sufficiently homogeneous.
With all these factors, it is difficult to generalise results across all the papers as there were large variations in ages and demographic factors of participants.
One of the most significant considerations is that of a wide age range of participants, as with older age, muscle size and quality deteriorates.
Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish these changes from that of diabetes.
Thus, a recommendation for future papers is to sub‐group participants into smaller age categories.
Studies that were not in English language were not included; therefore, potential papers may have been missed.
This review has identified significant heterogeneity in the included publications, with weak associations between toe and foot deformity and muscle atrophy.
Nonetheless, it has demonstrated that muscle atrophy is a likely contributor to structural changes in the diabetic foot.
Clinically, since IFMs appear to contribute to the development of diabetic toe and foot deformity and play an integral role in foot function and gait, clinicians should encourage exercise programmes that target increasing the strength of the IFMs.
Additionally, although X‐ray and CT are useful for bony deformities, it seems ultrasound shows promise as a useful screening tool for the musculature of diabetic feet, given its portability, wide availability, and the capacity to be used in multiple clinical settings such as physiotherapy and podiatry.
Clinicians may benefit from collaboration with their imaging colleagues or from learning the skill of ultrasound as a point‐of‐care application.
In an era of restraint in its use, ultrasound has the advantage of no ionising radiation (Image Wisely;https://www.imagewisely.org/).
Future research focusing on factors that have a greater association with diabetic foot deformity is recommended, including bone mineral density, limited joint movement and plantar aponeurosis thickening.
This will be beneficial in clarifying the development of diabetic foot deformity.
The use of US to investigate correlations between IFM atrophy and fatty infiltration due to diabetic foot deformity may be beneficial, providing real time information of muscle function in conjunction with ligament and tendon movements.
Significant associations between IFM atrophy and lesser toe deformities determined by US has been reported in older adults with claw toes [39].
Despite recent advances, there is still limited understanding of the development of diabetic foot deformities.
We found evidence that atrophy and increased intermuscular adipose tissue degradation of the intrinsic foot muscles are factors in the aetiology of these deformities.
Currently, the imaging modalities of MRI and CT are the most accurate and reliable methods for investigating the severity of structural changes in the diabetic foot.
Diabetic foot deformity is a complex, multifactorial complication of diabetes that should be prevented and managed in order to prevent ulcerations, infections, amputations and functional deficits.
