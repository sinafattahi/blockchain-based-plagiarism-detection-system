Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is the most severe manifestation of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, significantly impacting patient outcomes.
While immunosuppressive therapies like cyclophosphamide (CTX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are commonly used, evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC) in HSPN remains limited.
This study presents the first systematic review and meta-analysis specifically evaluating the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC) in treating Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), aiming to fill a critical gap in evidence for clinical decision-making.
This systematic review and meta-analysis, the first focused specifically on TAC in HSPN, included seven studies comprising 727 patients.
A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, VIP, and Embase.
Studies comparing TAC with control treatments, such as CTX or MMF, in HSPN patients were included.
Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, while standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for continuous variables.
Depending on heterogeneity, either random-effects or fixed-effects models were applied.
Data synthesis was performed using RevMan software.
A total of seven studies were included.
TAC therapy significantly improved clinical efficacy in HSPN patients (OR = 4.43; 95% CI: 2.86–6.87;P< 0.001).
Additionally, TAC significantly reduced urine protein levels (SMD = -1.17; 95% CI: -1.83 to -0.51;P< 0.001), serum creatinine (Scr) (SMD = -2.33; 95% CI: -3.00 to -1.65;P< 0.001), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (SMD = -1.49; 95% CI: -1.94 to -1.04;P< 0.001).
Importantly, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events between the TAC and control groups.
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis specifically evaluating TAC in HSPN, providing novel evidence that TAC is an effective and safe therapeutic option for these patients.
Its potential advantages over conventional immunosuppressive therapies highlight the need for further high-quality, long-term randomized controlled trials to confirm these findings and establish TAC’s role in HSPN management.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis, is one of the most prevalent forms of systemic vasculitis, with an incidence of approximately ten cases per 100,000 individuals annually [1].
Although HSP can affect individuals of all ages, it predominantly occurs in children under the age of 10 [2].
Clinically, HSP is characterized by purpuric rashes, but its systemic nature often results in multi-organ involvement, including the joints, gastrointestinal tract, and, critically, the kidneys [3].
Despite extensive use of immunosuppressants in HSPN, no prior systematic review has comprehensively assessed TAC in this setting, leaving clinicians with limited guidance on its benefits and risks.
Renal involvement, known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), is the most severe complication of the disease.
It commonly manifests as hematuria with or without proteinuria, which may range from microscopic to gross presentations [4].
Pathologically, HSPN is characterized by mesangial deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes, which activate the complement system and trigger glomerular inflammation, ultimately damaging the glomerular filtration barrier.
This process leads to clinical manifestations such as hematuria, proteinuria, and, in severe cases, nephrotic syndrome or progressive renal dysfunction.
In addition to immune complex deposition, T-cell–mediated immune dysregulation and podocyte injury contribute to disease progression.
Importantly, HSPN—especially when associated with nephrotic-range proteinuria—significantly increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or even death [5].
These risks highlight the urgent need for effective treatment strategies to prevent long-term renal impairment in affected patients.
Current treatment options for HSPN are largely extrapolated from therapeutic approaches for other glomerular diseases, such as lupus nephritis.
Tacrolimus (TAC), a calcineurin inhibitor, has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional immunosuppressants like intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) in lupus nephritis management [6].
TAC exerts its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting T-cell activation, thereby reducing autoantibody production and subsequent immune-mediated kidney injury [7].
Beyond its immunomodulatory properties, TAC may have direct nephroprotective effects, including the stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, prevention of podocyte apoptosis, and reduction of immune complex deposition within the glomeruli.
Furthermore, TAC’s potential steroid-sparing effect could mitigate the long-term adverse effects associated with corticosteroid therapy [8].
Despite these promising mechanisms, the role of TAC in the treatment of HSPN remains underexplored, with limited and heterogeneous clinical trial data available.
To address this gap, our study presents the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis specifically to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in HSPN.
By synthesizing data from multiple clinical trials, this study aims to provide robust evidence to guide clinical decision-making, enhance therapeutic precision, and ultimately improve renal outcomes in patients with HSPN.
The novelty of this work lies in its focused assessment of TAC in HSPN—a critical but underrepresented area in nephrology research—thereby filling a significant void in the current literature and offering new insights into the management of this challenging condition.
This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure accurate and transparent reporting of the data.
Clinical trial number of this research is not applicable.
A comprehensive literature search was independently performed by two authors, with any discrepancies resolved through discussion with the entire authorship team.
We systematically searched the following databases from their inception to May 31, 2023: Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, SinoMed, and VIP database.
The search strategy combined both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms, using the following search string: ((“Tacrolimus”) OR (“FK506”)) AND ((“Purpura, Schoenlein-Henoch”) OR (“Henoch-Schönlein purpura”) OR (“anaphylactoid purpura”)).
No language restrictions were applied, but only English and Chinese publications were included in the analysis.
The search was supplemented by manually screening the titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies, followed by a full-text review of eligible articles.
Studies published in English and Chinese that met the predefined inclusion criteria were considered eligible if they med the following criteria: (1) Included patients diagnosed specifically with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN); (2) Evaluated the efficacy and/or safety of tacrolimus (TAC) in the treatment of HSPN; (3) Reported at least one relevant clinical outcome, such as effective rate, urinary protein (UP), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or incidence of adverse events.
The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) Non-clinical studies, including animal experiments and in vitro research; (2) Narrative reviews, case reports, editorials, or conference abstracts; (3) Articles published in languages other than English or Chinese; (4) Full-text articles that were unavailable despite attempts to contact the authors or use retrieval services; (5) Studies involving mixed patient populations (e.g., HSPN combined with other nephropathies such as IgA nephropathy or lupus nephritis) were excluded to avoid confounding effects and to ensure that pooled outcomes reflect TAC efficacy specifically in HSPN; (6) Studies with “unclear outcomes,” defined as those lacking numerical results, reporting outcomes only descriptively, or omitting key clinical endpoints, were also excluded.
Two reviewers independently assessed all studies for eligibility.
Discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third investigator to ensure consistency and objectivity in study selection.
Data extraction was conducted based on predefined parameters, including study characteristics (author names and publication year), participant characteristics (gender and age), intervention details (type of medication, dosage, and sample size), and clinical outcomes such as effective rate, urinary protein (UP), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and adverse events.
The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion with the corresponding author.
The tool evaluates seven domains, with each domain rated as having a high, unclear, or low risk of bias.
Statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England) and R Studio.
Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Chi-square test and the I² statistic.
A fixed-effects model was applied when heterogeneity was not significant (P> 0.05 or I² < 50%), whereas a random-effects model was used in cases of significant heterogeneity.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity.
Effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) for categorical outcomes and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes.
A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots for outcomes with at least ten included studies.
To improve the clarity and fluency of the manuscript, we used ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA), a large language model, to assist in refining grammar and polishing the English language.
The scientific content and interpretations were written, reviewed, and verified solely by the authors.
A total of 103 articles were initially identified through systematic database searches.
After screening titles and abstracts, removing duplicates, and excluding irrelevant studies or those with insufficient data, 7 studies involving 727 patients met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into this meta-analysis [3,6,9–12].
The selection process adhered to PRISMA guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency (Fig.1).
Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tacrolimus (TAC) in treating Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis and reporting at least one of the following outcomes: effective rate, urinary protein (UP), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or adverse events.
Exclusion criteria were non-human studies, case reports, reviews, and studies lacking sufficient data or not comparing TAC with control treatments such as cyclophosphamide (CTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or standard therapy.
Participants’ ages ranged from 4.46 to 10.85 years, with varying male-to-female ratios.
TAC dosages ranged from 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg/day, CTX from 3 to 12 mg/kg/day or 750 mg/m², and MMF from 20 to 30 mg/kg/day (Table1).
The meta-analysis of 609 patients demonstrated no significant heterogeneity (I² = 0%,P= 0.88).
Utilizing a fixed-effect model, TAC treatment was associated with a significantly higher clinical efficacy compared to control treatments (OR = 4.43, 95% CI = [2.86, 6.87],P< 0.001) (Fig.2).
The pooled effective rate was 89% in the TAC group and 65.1% in the control group, resulting in an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 23.9%, and a a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4 to achieve one additional clinical response.
Substantial heterogeneity was detected in urinary protein levels (I² = 93%,P< 0.001), and applying a random-effects model, TAC significantly reduced urinary protein levels compared to controls (SMD = -1.17, 95% CI = [-1.83, -0.51],P< 0.001) (Fig.3).
To explore the sources of heterogeneity in urinary protein outcomes (I² = 93.4%), subgroup analyses were conducted based on type of control treatment and patient age.
In the subgroup analysis by control treatment, TAC significantly reduced urinary protein levels in both the CTX group (SMD = -1.10, 95% CI: -1.93 to -0.26, I² = 94.7%,p< 0.0001) and the MMF group (SMD = -1.44, 95% CI: -2.20 to -0.68, I² = 67.6%,p= 0.0788).
No significant subgroup difference was detected (p= 0.55), indicating consistent efficacy of TAC across different control treatments (Fig.4A).
In the subgroup analysis by patient age, TAC significantly reduced urinary protein levels in both the < 8 years group (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI: -3.70 to 1.18, I² = 98.2%,p< 0.0001) and the ≥ 8 years group (SMD = -0.84, 95% CI: -1.27 to -0.41, I² = 77.4%,p= 0.0005).
Similarly, no significant subgroup difference was observed (p= 0.74), suggesting that the efficacy of TAC was consistent across different age groups (Fig.4B).
Moderate heterogeneity was observed in serum creatinine (Scr) levels across six studies (I² = 69%,P< 0.001), with TAC significantly decreasing Scr levels compared to control groups (SMD = -2.33, 95% CI = [-3.00, -1.65],P< 0.001) (Fig.5).
To further explore the heterogeneity in Scr outcomes (I² = 69%), a subgroup analysis by control treatment was performed (Fig.6A).
TAC significantly reduced Scr levels in both CTX (SMD = -2.46, 95% CI: -3.21 to -1.71, I² = 90.3%) and MMF (SMD = -2.33, 95% CI: -3.01 to -1.64, I² = 89.2%) subgroups.
No significant subgroup difference was detected (p= 0.059), indicating that the efficacy of TAC was consistent across different control treatments.
A subgroup analysis by patient age confirmed the consistency of TAC efficacy as well (Fig.6B).
TAC significantly reduced Scr levels in both the < 8 years group (SMD = -2.35, 95% CI: -2.71 to -1.99, I² = 0%) and the ≥ 8 years group (SMD = -1.98, 95% CI: -2.91 to -1.05, I² = 89.5%).
No significant subgroup difference was observed (p= 0.46), suggesting that the efficacy of TAC was consistent across different age groups.
TAC treatment also led to a significant reduction in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (SMD = -1.49, 95% CI = [-1.94, -1.04],P< 0.001), despite considerable heterogeneity (I² = 74.8%,P< 0.001) (Fig.7).
Adverse events were reported in all seven studies.
Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (I² = 75.8%,P< 0.001).
Therefore, a random-effects model was applied, revealing no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between TAC and control groups (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = [0.87, 3.89] (Fig.8).
Although the pooled OR was greater than 1, the confidence interval crossed 1 and the result was not statistically significant indicating no clear evidence of in increased risk of adverse events associated with TAC.
The risk of bias for the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool.
The majority of studies demonstrated a low risk of bias in terms of incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.
However, several studies were rated as having an unclear risk of bias regarding random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment due to insufficient reporting of methodological details (Fig.9).
The funnel plot for adverse event outcomes appeared symmetrical, indicating no significant publication bias (Fig.10).
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the meta-analysis results, as the exclusion of studies with the highest weight did not significantly alter the findings.
This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC) in treating patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN).
The results demonstrated that TAC significantly improves clinical outcomes, including reductions in urinary protein (UP), serum creatinine (Scr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels [9].
Additionally, TAC showed a comparable safety profile to conventional therapies, with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events [13].
The novelty of this study lies in providing the most comprehensive synthesis to date specifically focused on the use of TAC in HSPN, which has not been systematically reviewed with such detail before [14].
While previous studies have assessed TAC’s role in other nephropathies, this meta-analysis uniquely highlights its effectiveness and safety profile specifically in HSPN, offering new insights into its clinical application for this condition [15].
Our findings align with existing literature highlighting TAC’s potential benefits in managing immune-mediated renal diseases [16].
Traditionally, HSPN is managed with glucocorticoids combined with cyclophosphamide (CTX) [17,18].
However, glucocorticoids cannot reverse the irreversible kidney damage associated with HSPN, and CTX is linked to considerable toxicity, including gastrointestinal complications and systemic toxicity [2,19].
Since the 1980s, TAC has been employed as an immunosuppressant in organ transplantation, offering a stronger immunosuppressive effect than CTX at equivalent doses [20].
TAC’s efficacy has been explored in various nephropathies.
In lupus nephritis, TAC has demonstrated superior renal remission rates compared to CTX, though not significantly different from mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) [21].
Furthermore, TAC was associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, less leukopenia, fewer menstrual disturbances, and reduced infections and liver dysfunction compared to CTX, although it showed higher rates of hypertension and hyperglycemia [22].
In primary membranous nephropathy, TAC and CTX exhibited comparable long-term renal remission rates, with TAC presenting a higher incidence of tremor but a lower risk of leukopenia [23].
Mechanistically, TAC stabilizes the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and reduces podocyte apoptosis, which contributes to its protective effect on glomerular function.
It also reduces immune complex deposition, which may help preserve renal structure and function [16].
These podocyte-stabilizing effects provide biological plausibility to the observed clinical improvements.
Safety remains a key concern when using TAC for HSPN.
Adverse events commonly reported include infections, renal dysfunction, hyperglycemia, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, insomnia, and tremors [24].
While our meta-analysis found no significant difference in adverse event rates between TAC and control groups, the overall l trend toward increased adverse events in the TAC group (OR = 1.84) warrants caution [13].
This suggests that although TAC is generally well-tolerated, clinicians should closely monitor patients for potential side effects [25].
This study has several limitations related to study design.
Several included studies were assessed as having unclear or moderate risk of bias, particularly in random sequence generation and blinding, which could have inflated treatment effects.
The quality of the included studies was variable, with some small-sample studies contributing relatively low weight to the pooled estimates.
Additionally, the lack of adequate blinding in several trials may have introduced performance or detection bias.
Furthermore, the inclusion of non-randomized studies could introduce confounding or selection bias and may affect the pooled estimates.
The relatively small sample sizes of individual studies and the limited total number of studies (n= 7) may also reduce the statistical power and generalizability of the findings.
Although the funnel plot appeared symmetrical, the small number of studies limits the ability to conclusively assess potential publication bias.
We recommend interpreting the findings with caution and emphasize the need for future RCTs.
This emphasizes the need for better methodological reporting in future trials.
Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity was observed in certain outcomes, including urinary protein (I² = 93%) and Scr (I² = 69%).
To explore the sources of heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses by type of control treatment and patient age.
The results demonstrated that the efficacy of TAC in reducing urinary protein and Scr levels remained consistent across different control treatments (CTX vs. MMF) and age groups (< 8 years vs. ≥ 8 years), with no significant subgroup differences detected.
These findings suggest that the observed heterogeneity is likely attributable to clinical variations such as differences in disease severity, treatment protocols, and patient characteristics across studies, rather than a true inconsistency in TAC efficacy.
Clinically, this supports the robustness and generalizability of our findings, indicating that TAC may be effective across a broad range of patient populations and treatment settings.
Nevertheless, future meta-regression analyses incorporating additional covariates (e.g., baseline proteinuria, TAC dosage, treatment duration) are warranted to further elucidate potential sources of heterogeneity and optimize individualized treatment strategies.
Although the funnel plot appeared symmetrical, the relatively small number of studies (n= 7) may limit statistical power, the consistent directionality of results across multiple outcomes supports a preliminary inference of tacrolimus efficacy in HSPN [26].
Future studies with larger sample sizes are essential.
The variability in study designs and quality also restricted the ability to perform detailed subgroup analyses [27].
Additionally, the lack of long-term follow-up data limits conclusions regarding the sustained efficacy and safety of TAC in HSPN [28].
In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides the first robust evidence emphasizing TAC’s superior efficacy over traditional therapies like CTX and MMF in HSPN, with a manageable safety profile [29].
These findings suggest that TAC could be a valuable adjunct to steroids in HSPN treatment, potentially offering a more effective therapeutic option [30].
However, further high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are necessary to confirm these findings and establish definitive clinical guidelines for TAC use in HSPN [16].
