Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are biomolecules with applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and nutraceutical industries.
However, traditional GAG sources, such as animal tissues and marine organisms, present imminent challenges, including structural heterogeneity, contamination risk, and geographical sourcing limitations.
This review explores the potential of the eggshell matrix, an abundant yet underutilized by‐product of the egg industry, as a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative source of GAG production.
This review examined the composition of the eggshell matrix, highlighting its rich content of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and other valuable GAGs, coupled with their extraction and purification techniques.
The advantages of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs, including their consistent molecular properties, lower allergenicity, and alignment with circular economy principles, are also discussed.
Additionally, this review highlights the industrial scalability of eggshell matrix valorization and its potential to mitigate environmental waste while meeting global GAG demand.
The eggshell matrix shows promise for GAG production, with hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate already identified, but more work is needed to improve extraction efficiency, broaden industrial uses, and ensure commercial success.
This represents the broad areas of process optimization, technological integration, and comprehensive economic evaluation.
By addressing current challenges and future research directions, this review underscores the transformative potential of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs for advancing sustainable biomaterial production.
An Overview of Glycosaminoglycans Recovery Techniques and Their Diverse Applications.
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a family of linear, negatively charged polysaccharides found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of most cell types [1,2,3].
GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharide units, typically an amino sugar (N‐acetylglucosamine [GlcNAc] orN‐acetylgalactosamine [GalNAc]) and uronic acid (glucuronic or iduronic acid [IdoA]) [4], that are often sulfated at various positions, conferring significant anionic character [5].
The arrangements of these structural features contribute to the diversity and biological specificity of GAGs [6,7], enabling their key participation in cell signaling, tissue hydration, wound healing, and inflammation regulation [8].
Currently, the commercial production of GAGs such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate (CS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) relies heavily on animal‐derived tissues, including intestinal mucosa, bovine trachea, rooster combs, and marine cartilage [5,9,10].
These sources raise significant concerns related to sustainability, ethical considerations, zoonotic risks, and supply chain stability.
While non‐animal alternatives like microbial fermentation and recombinant biosynthesis are being explored [11,12], their large‐scale operationalization remains hindered by high cost, limited scalability, and regulatory challenges.
These limitations highlight the need for novel, sustainable sources.
Given this, the eggshell matrix, comprising the mineralized or calcified shell and the organic fibrous membrane, has emerged as a promising yet underutilized bioresource for GAG extraction.
The eggshell matrix comes as a by‐product of the egg industry, which is generated in large quantities globally and often ends up in landfills, contributing to environmental pollution [13].
Meanwhile, both the eggshell and its membrane are rich in bioactive macromolecules, including collagen, glycoproteins, and GAGs, presenting them as sustainable and cost‐effective substrates for biorefinery approaches [14,15].
Despite the recent increase in attention, the potential of eggshell matrix as a viable and scalable source of GAGs has not been comprehensively explored.
The lack of a unified understanding of extraction methods, structure–function relationships, and potential broader industrial applications characterizes the key barriers to valorizing this bioresource.
The existing literature, in most aspects, focuses on the compositional analysis of eggshell membranes (ESMs) or the general recycling of eggshell waste.
Few studies comprehensively integrate the biochemical, technological, applications, and scalability feasibility of the sustainable recovery of GAGs from eggshell matrix.
Furthermore, a holistic comparison of the eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs with conventional sources in terms of purity, abundance, sustainability potential, and structural heterogeneity is lacking.
This review aims to comprehensively assess the potential for upcycling eggshell matrix for sustainable GAG production, critically analyzing the current sources, challenges, and opportunities.
It seeks to bridge the gap between eggshell waste management and high‐value biomolecule recovery.
The review contributes to the field by identifying and synthesizing recent advances in GAG extraction from eggshell matrix, comparing the structural and functional characteristics of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs with those from traditional sources, and highlighting the scalability potential of sustainable production of GAGs from eggshell matrix.
With the efforts to redefine eggshell matrix as a valuable raw material, this study presents a sustainable approach to eggshell matrix recycling and utilization, minimizing environmental impact, and strengthening the efficiency and resilience of GAG supply chains.
Each GAG exhibits distinct structural and chemical features that dictate its unique biological, physiological, and functional role.
Descriptions of the chemical structures of commonly known GAGs, including hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS), heparin, and keratan sulfate (KS), are provided herein.
HA is composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N‐acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), linked by β(1,4)‐GlcA and β(1,3)‐GlcNAc bonds, and is the only known non‐sulfated GAG [7].
Found in the ECM, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus, HA is essential for tissue hydration, cell signaling, joint lubrication, wound healing, and the regulation of cell migration [16].
CS, on the other hand, consists of repeating disaccharide units of GalNAc and GlcA, connected via β(1, 3) and β(1, 4) glycosidic bonds.
CS plays crucial roles in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, signaling, and neuronal growth [17].
DS shares similarities with CS but is distinguished by the conversion of GlcA residues to IdoA by DS epimerases [18,19].
This modification enables DS to serve as a neuritogenic molecule, influencing axonal growth and central nervous system regeneration [10].
DS also exhibits a flexible structure that facilitates interactions with growth factors, aiding in coagulation and wound healing regulation [20].
HS consists of disaccharide units of GlcA/IdoA and glucosamine (GlcN) with fewer sulfate groups than heparin [21].
Variations in epimerization, acetylation, and sulfation patterns confer structural diversity to HS [22].
HS interacts with cytokines, such as IL‐6, modulating immune responses and inflammation [23].
Heparin (H) is highly sulfated and composed of α‐glycosidic linkages and disaccharide repeats of GlcN joined with GlcA or IdoA.
GlcN residues contain sulfamide linkages and can be N‐acetylated, N‐sulfated, or O‐sulfated on C‐6 of GlcN, O‐sulfated on C‐3 of the hexosamine, and C‐2 of GlcA.
Its sulfamide linkages and extensive sulfation make it an excellent anticoagulant and lipid‐clearing agent [24].
KS is characterized by repeating disaccharide units where galactose (Gal) is linked β1–4 to GlcNAc.
Unlike other GAGs, KS lacks uronic acid but may include other monosaccharides, such as mannose, fucose, sialic acid, or GalNAc.
KS exists in two forms: KS‐I, which is linked to proteins via GlcNAc‐asparaginyl bonds and is predominantly found in the cornea, contributing to transparency and structural integrity, and KS‐II, which is linked to serine or threonine via GlcNAc, mainly present in cartilage tissue [25].
In general, KS plays a significant role in neural processes due to its interactive capabilities with various extracellular components [26].
The MW and polydispersity of GAGs vary widely depending on their source, influencing their functionality and processing complexity.
High‐MW GAGs are known to promote cell adhesion and proliferation by interacting efficiently with cell surface receptors [27].
But they often require intensive purification, complicating their production [5].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as HA from rooster combs and CS from bovine cartilage, typically have high MWs (80 kDa to several MDa) with moderate polydispersity due to natural biosynthetic control.
For example, optimized enzymatic treatment of cattle nasal cartilage yielded CS with an MW of 89.21 kDa [27].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as CS from shark cartilage or DS from fish skin, typically exhibit lower MWs (10–500 kDa) and higher polydispersity [28], likely due to enzymatic degradation during extraction [29,30,31].
In contrast, eggshell matrix GAGs are generally isolated using a mixture of chemical and enzymatic procedures that contribute to preserving their integrity, resulting in reduced polydispersity.
Microbial GAGs, such as HA fromStreptococcus zooepidemicusprovide tunable MWs and low polydispersity, making them suitable for biomedical applications [32,33].
In contrast, eggshell matrix GAGs exhibit narrower and more uniform weight (20–40 kDa), a result of well‐regulated biomineralization.
This size range has been associated with enhanced solubility, improved diffusivity, and more consistent interaction profiles with biological targets, distinguishing it from the more heterogeneous behavior of high‐MW GAGs.
These properties contribute to predictable bioactivity and are particularly advantageous for biomedical and industrial applications.
In contrast, eggshell matrix GAGs exhibit a narrower and more uniform MW (20–40 kDa), a result of well‐regulated biomineralization.
This size range has been associated with enhanced solubility, improved diffusivity, and more consistent interaction profiles with biological targets, distinguishing it from the more heterogeneous behavior of high‐MW GAGs.
These properties contribute to predictable bioactivity and are particularly advantageous in precision‐demanding biomedical and industrial applications [13,14,34].
Charge density, defined by the concentration of negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate groups, is a critical factor influencing GAG functionality [35].
A higher charge density enhances the GAG‐protein binding affinity, increasing viscosity and improving joint lubrication [36,37].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as heparin from the porcine intestine, exhibit high charge densities owing to extensive sulfation, which enhances biological activities, such as anticoagulation [38].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as fucoidan from brown algae, exhibit high charge densities and unique sulfation patterns that impart antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties [39,40].
Microbial‐derived GAGs, such as HA, typically have a lower charge density due to the absence of sulfate groups, resulting in high solubility and biocompatibility [41].
Eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs exhibit low to intermediate charge densities, with sulfated GAGs contributing to bioactivity.
Their sulfate groups are more uniformly distributed than the clustered patterns in mammalian GAGs, offering consistent physical properties and controlled drug delivery applications.
Predominantly, 4‐O‐sulfated eggshell GAGs influence chain flexibility and molecular interactions, making them promising candidates for tailored biomedical applications.
The solubility of GAGs is influenced by their sources and by their structural characteristics.
Highly soluble GAGs enhance biological activity through effective interactions with proteins and growth factors, while stable GAGs retain functionality over time [42].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as HA and CS, are highly water‐soluble due to their hydrophilic and charged structures, but are prone to enzymatic degradation in vivo [43].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as carrageenan from red algae, combine high solubility and stability, making them suitable for food and pharmaceutical use [44,45].
Microbial‐derived GAGs, such as HA, offer excellent solubility and enhanced stability, particularly when chemically modified [46,47].
Eggshell‐derived GAGs also show favorable solubility and stability under neutral to slightly alkaline conditions.
Their sulfated nature imparts resistance to enzymatic breakdown, positioning them as promising alternatives for biomedical and industrial applications [48].
In addition, eggshell matrix GAGs have been studied in both their purified form and as components of composite biomaterials.
However, recent research emphasizes their integration into composite biomaterials such as hydrogels, films, and biopolymer blends [49,50], where consistent weight and bioactivity help enhance mechanical performance [51].
The rheological properties of GAGs are crucial for their application in biomaterials and tissue engineering [52].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as HA, exhibit unique viscoelastic properties, making them ideal lubricants and hydrogels [53].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as alginate from brown algae, also demonstrate high viscosity and gel‐forming abilities, which are utilized in wound healing and drug delivery [54,55].
Microbial‐derived GAGs, such as HA, can be engineered to achieve specific rheological properties, including shear‐thinning behavior, which is beneficial for injectable hydrogels [56].
Eggshell‐derived GAGs show promise for forming hydrogels with moderate viscosity and elasticity, which are suitable for use in regenerative medicine and drug delivery [57].
For instance, a hybrid tissue scaffold hydrogel containing 10% eggshell particles exhibited a 47% improvement in mechanical properties compared to a neat hydrogel scaffold [58].
Another study incorporated 4 w/v% ESM into gellan gum (GG) to create a composite hydrogel, enhancing its degradability, biocompatibility, and anti‐swelling properties while facilitating cell proliferation without significant cytotoxicity [59].
These findings highlight the potential of eggshell‐derived GAGs for advanced biomedical applications.
The superiority of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs is attributed to their uniform MWs, easy handling and purification requirements, predictable processing behavior, and balanced charge density with uniform 4‐O‐sulfation, offering enhanced chain flexibility and controlled bioactivity over the irregular sulfation patterns of animal‐ and microbial‐derived GAGs.
Eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs also exhibit high solubility and stability, making them highly resistant to enzymatic degradation and functionally stable under physiological conditions.
Rheological superiority enables the fabrication of hydrogels with tunable viscosities and elasticities.
Figure1shows the comparative advantages of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs over their conventional counterparts.
Comparative analysis of the physical properties of glycosaminoglycans and potential functional applications across different sources.
The production of GAGs faces substantial setbacks because of their inherent structural heterogeneity.
Variations in MW, sulfation patterns, and biological activity present complications in production processes and impact therapeutic efficacy [60].
GAGs exist in diverse chain lengths, from short oligosaccharides to long polysaccharides [12], with random chain breakages during extraction and processing contributing to their heterogeneity.
This variation directly influences their biology, as different MWs can lead to distinct therapeutic effects [61].
For instance, high‐molecular‐weight HA oligosaccharides are known to be effective in drug delivery and cancer therapy.
Sulfation patterns vary depending on the source of the tissue, species, and physiological conditions, contributing to a significant degree of complexity [62].
These patterns are critical for biological activities, such as protein binding, as observed in heparin, where a specific saccharide sequence is essential for antithrombin binding [63].
However, ensuring sulfation consistency remains a major challenge.
Current analytical methods have proven ineffective in fully characterizing these variations, presenting hurdles in terms of quality control, regulatory compliance, and product consistency [64].
Current GAG sources, especially those of animal origin, exhibit substantial structural variability, posing challenges in manufacturing, research, and clinical applications.
Traditional sources of GAGs, such as animal tissues and bacteria, pose significant biological and chemical contamination risks.
Animal‐derived GAGs may harbor pathogenic microorganisms, prions (especially from bovine sources), and residual cellular components that can trigger immune responses [46].
Bacterial‐derived GAGs often contain endotoxins from bacterial cell walls, which can induce severe inflammatory reactions even at low concentrations [65].
The chemical contamination profile of GAGs, including heavy metals, pesticides, and residual antibodies from husbandry practices, further complicates the extraction and purification processes, affecting GAG quality and end‐use performance [66,67].
This hinders the purity requirements of nutraceuticals and cosmetic products, highlighting the need for safer alternative sources.
In addition to structural heterogeneity and contamination risks, seasonal and geographical variations pose significant production challenges, particularly for marine‐derived GAGs.
The biochemical profile of marine‐derived GAGs is influenced by the life cycle of the source organisms, including breeding seasons, growth phases, and molting periods [7].
Extreme weather conditions, such as storms, temperature shifts, and ice coverage, further disrupt harvesting and accessibility to marine resources [68].
Geographical factors also play a crucial role in the differences in temperature and salinity that affect the molecular properties of GAGs from coastal and deep‐water sources [28,69].
For example, polysaccharides fromGracilaria chouaeexhibit variations in total sugar and anhydrogalactose content across five regions, which directly affect their gel properties [70].
Furthermore, the negative impact of water pollution on ecosystem health has a subsequent negative effect on the purity of the extracted GAGs.
The environmental and ethical implications of sourcing conventional GAGs raise significant sustainability concerns.
Marine sources, particularly shark cartilage for CS extraction, face critical sustainability issues due to overfishing, with some shark populations declining sharply in heavily fished regions [71].
Destructive harvesting methods, such as bottom trawling, exacerbate ecological damage by destabilizing coral reefs and benthic ecosystems [72,73].
On land, intensive livestock farming, a primary source of GAG raw materials, generates 64% of ammonia emissions, contributing to acid rain and biodiversity loss [74].
Additionally, livestock farming produces significant amounts of greenhouse gases, such as CO2and CH4which accelerate climate change [75].
The GAG industry also generates substantial waste, with bovine slaughter producing 275 kg/ton and pig slaughter producing 2.3 kg/ton of solids [76].
These environmental and waste management challenges, coupled with the overexploitation of marine and livestock resources threaten raw material availability and supply chain stability.
The presence of allergenic proteins in GAG production poses significant challenges in manufacturing and public health.
Crustacean shells, a common GAG source contain heat‐resistant allergenic proteins such as tropomyosin, arginine kinase, and myosin light chain, which persist even after thermal processing [77].
Although GAGs are not allergenic, extraction and purification processes often fail to completely remove these proteins, risking the contamination of the final product [78].
This is particularly concerning for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, where GAG‐based products such as CS and GlcN are widely used.
Current processing techniques are insufficient to eliminate crustacean allergens, making dietary avoidance the safest practice [79,80].
To address these challenges, eggshells and ESMs have emerged as promising, allergen‐free alternatives.
These sources not only provide a safer and higher‐quality profile but also align with sustainable production practices, reducing the reliance on traditional crustacean‐derived GAGs.
Furthermore, in the United States, the European Union, and Canada jurisdictions, the presence of any detectable crustacean protein, such as tropomyosin, must be declared on product packaging [81,82].
Although universally defined thresholds for allowable allergen levels are lacking, regulatory authorities require manufacturers to adhere to stringent purification protocols including validated protein testing, to ensure product safety and consumer protection [77,83].
Given this, certain standardized and reliable methods have been developed to detect residual allergenic proteins in crustacean‐derived products, including GAGs.
Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been the most widely adopted technique due to its high sensitivity and specificity for crustacean allergens, which offer high sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 1 ppm [84].
Rapid on‐site detection can be performed using lateral flow immunoassays, which detect crustacean proteins at concentrations around 1 μg/g [85].
For confirmatory and multiplex analysis, liquid chromatography tandem‐mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offer highly sensitive detection of crustacean DNA or tropomyosin‐derived peptides, with quantification reported as low as 1.6 ppm [86] and 0.1 ppm [87], respectively.
These standardized detection techniques enable manufacturers to monitor residual allergen thresholds in final GAG preparation, ensuring regulatory compliance and protection of public health.
Owing to their structural and biochemical diversity, GAGs have been used in various therapeutic applications, drug delivery systems, and biomedical interventions [88].
Their polyanionic features enable the formation of stable drug‐carrier complexes, thereby enhancing drug delivery efficiency.
For instance, heparin‐conjugated liposomes have shown excellent potential in cancer therapy, exhibiting enhanced drug‐targeted delivery precision and pharmacokinetics [89,90].
A chitosan‐heparin‐coated liposome (400 nm, −31 mV) has proven effective for cancer drug delivery [91], while disulfide cross‐linked heparin‐chitosan‐lipoic acid nanocarriers have demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity and tumor‐targeting capabilities, particularly in skin cancer [90].
In tissue engineering, HA‐based scaffolds exhibit superior biocompatibility and cell adhesion, facilitating chondrocyte proliferation for cartilage regeneration [92].
Additionally, HA accelerates wound healing, with clinical studies indicating 40%–60% faster wound closure rates due to improved fibroblast migration and collagen synthesis.
In cardiovascular applications, heparin remains an excellent standard anticoagulant, preventing thrombus formation by selectively inhibiting factor Xa and thrombin and helping to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation at doses of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL in plasma [93].
Table1summarizes recent studies (2022–2025) focused on GAG‐integrated nanocarriers developed for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.
It highlights various nanocarrier platforms, including liposomes, polymeric micelles, lipid nanoparticles, and hydrogels, incorporating GAG components such as heparin, HA, and CS.

GAGs serve as a biological bridge between cosmetic enhancement and wound healing, due to their shared mechanisms of action.
The same pathways that hydrate, firm, and smooth the skin also modulate inflammation and promote tissue regeneration.
For instance, high‐molecular‐weight HA forms a moisture‐retentive film that visibly plumps the epidermis while simultaneously suppressing pro‐inflammatory cytokines and accelerating re‐epithelialization, making it a staple in both anti‐aging serums and clinical wound dressing [100,101,102].
Likewise, sulfated‐GAG “second‐skin” hydrogels marketed for luxury sheet masks leverage their film‐forming and cytokine‐sequestering properties to polarize macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, stimulate angiogenesis, and enhance wound closure in chronic conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers [103,104,105,106].
The overlap in biological function underscores the growing field of cosmeceuticals, where formulations are intentionally crafted to deliver both immediate aesthetic improvements and clinically relevant therapeutic outcomes [107].
In cosmetics and personal care formulations, GAGs play a significant role in providing unique benefits for skin‐ and hair‐care products.
HA is known for its exceptional moisture retention abilities, as it can bind up to 1000 times its weight in water, significantly enhancing skin hydration and elasticity.
GAG‐based formulations have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, facilitated tissue regeneration, and reduced scar formation.
Clinical studies have revealed that GAG‐enriched dressings reduce healing time and minimize scar formation compared to standard treatment.
Studies have shown that high‐molecular‐weight HA, when vectorized with clay, enhances skin penetration, effectively minimizing wrinkles and smoothing the skin [108].
Bionic sulfated GAG‐based hydrogels have shown promise in diabetic foot ulcer treatment by promoting collagen generation, angiogenesis, and epidermal regeneration [104], highlighting their ability to modulate cytokine levels and tissue remodeling.
In hair care, GAGs have been used extensively to promote hair growth [109,110,111].
For instance, hydrogel‐incorporated GAGs enhance hair follicle survival and stimulate proliferation, influencing the transition between hair growth phases [112].
GAGs extracted from ascidian tunics have outperformed conventional treatments, such as minoxidil, by significantly increasing human dermal papilla cell prefiltration [113].
GAGs have been used in various applications in food and nutraceuticals because of their diverse functional properties, including probiotic benefits and antioxidant capacity [114].
In dietary supplements, CS combined with GlcN has demonstrated significant efficacy in joint health management, with clinical studies reporting a 50%–60% reduction in osteoarthritis symptoms after 12 weeks of supplementation at daily doses of 1200–1500 mg [115].
GAG‐derived oligosaccharides have been reported to exhibit notable prebiotic potential.
For instance, pea‐derived galactooligosaccharides (α‐GOS and β‐GOS) have been shown to enhance gut microbiota, particularly by increasing the populations ofBifidobacterium longumsubsp.longumandBifidobacterium catenulatum/pseudo‐catenulatum[116].
In a similar study, xylooligosaccharides (XOS) derived from agricultural waste, such as sugarcane straw and coffee husks were found to selectively promote the growth ofLactobacillusandBifidobacteriumspecies while resisting digestive enzymes, making them ideal fermentation substrates for prebiotic bacteria [117].
XOS also exhibited significant antioxidant activity, highlighting its potential for functional food applications.
Furthermore, non‐digestible XOS and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) extracted from rice bran release short‐chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, during fermentation, further underscoring their probiotic properties [118].
GAGs are increasingly used in biotechnology and industrial processing because of their intermolecular interactions.
Their ability to enhance enzyme stability, reusability, and catalytic activity makes them ideal for enzyme immobilization, which is a critical factor in cost‐effective bioprocesses [119].
For instance, Ishido et al. [120] demonstrated that attaching GAG chains to peptides using endo‐β‐xylosidase improved enzyme performance.
A recent study by Bourgeais et al. [121] detailed the chemoenzymatic synthesis of tetrasaccharide linker peptides, indicating the biological significance of GAG synthesis and its relevance in enhancing enzyme properties through GAG‐peptide interactions.
The diverse functionalities of GAGs, including their interactions with peptides and enzymes, position them as promising materials for enhancing the efficiency of various biotechnological processes.
Global egg production is a significant contributor to food waste, with the International Egg Commission (IEC) projecting an output of 90 million tons by 2030 [122].
Annual production stands at approximately 65.5 million metric tons, generating 8.30 million metric tons of eggshell waste in 2019 [123].
Recently, Asia has experienced a fourfold increase in egg production, with China accounting for 45% of global production.
In 2019, China produced 604.7 billion eggs, surpassing the combined output of the next five largest producers: Mexico, India, the United States, and Brazil [124].
Eggshells make up 9%–12% of an egg and contribute an estimated 7.2 million metric tons of waste annually [123], with the food processing industry contributing approximately 250,000 tons.
Other major sources include bakeries, households, poultry farms, and hatcheries [125,126,127,128].
The improper disposal of eggshells poses significant environmental challenges, as their decomposition in landfills releases foul odors and attracts pests, creating unhygienic conditions that foster harmful bacteria and spread diseases [128,129].
Classified as hazardous waste in the European Union [6], eggshells increase waste management costs, and their upcycling offers sustainable solutions and economic opportunities.
They are composed of 95% calcium carbonate and 5% organic matrix, including proteins, glycoproteins, and GAGs [126,128].
The ESM contains collagen and GAGs, including HA, which constitutes 58% of its GAG content [130].
These components have applications in medicine, cosmetics, and tissue engineering, transforming waste into high‐value functional products, creating economic opportunities, and enabling sustainable industrial applications across many industries.
The circular valorization of eggshell offers a persuasive blueprint for sustainable waste management, while delivering both environmental and economic benefits.
According to the US EPA (2023), food waste accounts for approximately 58% of landfill‐derived methane emissions [131].
In Canada, food waste generated 56.5 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2021, with the entire waste sector contributing 14% of national emissions [132].
Diverting eggshell matrix from landfills, whether from household or industrial sources, can therefore significantly reduce methane emissions.
Eggshell matrix is rich in calcium carbonate, which is increasingly explored as a sustainable substitute for cement materials.
Conventional production of 1 kg of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) emits about 0.74–0.90 kg of CO2[133], while eggshell processing, if done without calcination, emits just 0.12–0.13 kg CO2per kg [134].
Studies show that partial replacement of cement (2.5%–15%) with eggshell powder can enhance compressive strength and density in mortar [80,135].
In agriculture, crushed eggshells improve soil pH, phosphorus availability, and water retention, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers [136,137].
Additionally, calcined eggshell powder (CES‐800) can adsorb phosphate from wastewater and serve as a slow‐release fertilizer [138].
Furthermore, eggshell matrix processing is less energy‐ and water‐intensive than limestone mining, supporting resource efficiency [139].
Economically, it creates value in agriculture, construction, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics [130,140,141].
A circular eggshell matrix supply chain could divert up to 75% of waste, advancing a sustainable bioeconomy.
Figure2exemplifies a sustainable bioeconomy, transforming waste into a cross‐sectoral opportunity for environmental and economic gains.
Comprehensive valorization pathways for eggshell matrix waste valorization: From source recovery to high‐value applications and circular economy integration.
Eggshells are composed of 95% calcium carbonate (CaCO3), with the remaining 5% comprising an organic matrix [128].
The organic matrix contains proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, with GAG content varying depending on the breed and color of the egg.
Uronic acid, a carbohydrate component of GAGs, constitutes approximately 0.024% of the dry weight of the eggshell.
The total GAG content includes HA (0.29 μg/mg) and a CS‐DS copolymer (0.38 μg/mg), totaling approximately 0.67 μg/mg dry weight [142].
GAGs in ESM contain collagen (types I, V, and X), GAGs, egg white proteins, and eggshell matrix proteins [47].
GAGs in the ESM include HA, CS A and B, DS, keratin sulfate, and uronic acid [1].
Notably, ESM is a rich source of HA, accounting for 48% of the total GAG content, and plays a critical role in tissue hydration, cellular growth, differentiation, and transport [143].
This unique composition presents opportunities for upcycling waste.
Figure3shows the advantages of egg‐derived GAG compared to GAG derived from other sources.
Collagen and HA derived from ESM are highly valuable for applications in medicine and cosmetics, including tissue engineering, wound dressing, and drug delivery systems [144].
Comparative overview of the unique characteristics and advantages of GAGs derived from the eggshell matrix compared to conventional sources, including animal tissues, marine organisms, and microbial systems.
GAGs possess sensitive structural conformations that necessitate carefully controlled extraction methods to preserve their bioactivity.
This is particularly critical for eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs, which are typically extracted using chemically assisted hydrolysis.
Chemical pretreatment, such as alkaline or acidic solution, helps weaken the matrix, enabling subsequent enzymatic treatments to effectively release the GAGs [144].
Key extraction parameters such as pH, temperature, and duration must be optimized to ensure high yields without compromising molecular integrity [145].
Comparative studies indicate that combined enzymatic methods yield GAGs with higher purity and preserved functionality.
For example, a papain‐bromelain mixture at pH 8 extracted HA from ESMs with a yield of 6.70% [146].
However, while HA remains stable at neutral pH, it can degrade under acidic conditions.
Alkaline treatments, though effective in solubilizing GAGs, may also reduce bioactivity due to molecular breakdown.
In another study, papain extraction at 60°C and pH 5 yielded 5.48% HA from ESMs, demonstrating the efficiency of enzyme combinations over single enzyme approaches [125].
Despite their advantages in yield and purity, the enzymatic method is limited by the high cost and specificity of enzymes.
Chemical extraction can be useful, particularly for isolating sulfated GAGs, but its reliance on harsh conditions limits sustainability and compatibility.
Enzymatic hydrolysis remains the preferred method due to its superior structure preservation, biocompatibility, and environmental performance.
Hybrid methods that combine physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments have also shown great potential, as demonstrated by Nakano et al. [142].
Table2presents a comparison of GAG yields from eggshell and membrane substrates using different extraction methods.
Reported GAG yields (μg/mg) from eggshell matrix compartments substrates using different methods.
Note:Extraction yields reported as percentages were converted to μg/mg.
The average extraction yields reported as a range were used.
A common method for extracting GAGs from the eggshell matrix involves chemically assisted enzyme catalysis, a multistep process that isolates and fractionates these valuable biomolecules [152].
This process followed the typical extraction technique employed by Nakano et al. [142].
The process begins with decalcification, where pulverized eggshells are incubated in acetic acid to remove inorganic minerals, leaving an organic matrix rich in GAGs.
The mixture was then divided into two portions: one for GAG extraction and the other for mineral analysis.
The decalcified portion was subjected to dialysis against water and freeze‐dried to eliminate salts and small molecules.
Next, enzymatic digestion with papain is used to release the GAGs from the protein matrix.
Optimizing the enzyme‐to‐sample ratio, pH, and temperature is critical for ensuring efficient digestion while minimizing GAG degradation.
Proteins were then precipitated using trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation to collect the GAG‐rich supernatant.
The second dialysis step further purifies the GAGs.
Purified GAGs were precipitated using cetylpyridinium chloride to form a cetylpyridinium‐GAG complex and a sequential washing with NaCl to fractionate GAGs.
Washing with 0.4 M NaCl typically yields a fraction enriched in HA, whereas a subsequent wash with 2.1 M NaCl isolates galactosaminoglycans, primarily CS–DS copolymers.
Figure4shows the steps involved in the enzyme‐catalytic extraction of GAGs from the avian eggshell matrix.
Enzyme‐catalytic extraction of glycosaminoglycans from avian eggshell matrix.
According to a recent report by ReportLinker, global egg production in 2023 was estimated to reach approximately 84.72 million metric tons, generating approximately 8.40 million metric tons of eggshell matrix waste, estimated at 10% of the egg weight [153].
Only approximately 30% of the eggs are processed.
Studies indicate that only 30% of the total eggs produced are processed at the industrial level [143], equally contributing to the available eggshell matrix byproducts for valorization.
Recent studies have reported that GAGs, emerging bioactive compounds, are being sought for various pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, biomedical, and food processing applications.
Efforts to extract GAG from the eggshell matrix, both the calcified shell and the organic membrane, have revealed that the membrane can provide a high GAG yield of approximately 64 μg/mg [147], with the calcified eggshell yielding a GAG as high as 6.38 μg/mg [150] (Table2).
Scaling this to the total global eggshell waste, with an annual GAG production of 596.27k metric tons (kMT) per year, if all eggshell matrix waste were utilized, or 178.88k metric tons from processed eggs alone.
Despite this immense potential, eggshell matrix waste remains largely underexploited for GAG production and mostly ends up in landfills.
Fully harnessing this resource could provide an avenue for the sustainable supply of GAGs while significantly mitigating waste management issues in the egg industry.
To capitalize on this opportunity, detailed insights and research are needed to develop cost‐effective extraction methods and market feasibility assessments.
The eggshell matrix represents a scalable, sustainable, and cost‐effective source of GAGs, offering a promising alternative to conventional sources.
As a byproduct of the egg industry, the eggshell matrix is abundant, globally available, and inexpensive, ensuring a consistent supply of raw material without the specialized sourcing required for marine‐derived GAGs [154].
In addition, the global availability of eggshell matrices eliminates sourcing challenges and reduces raw material costs, making them an attractive alternative to traditional sources [155,156].
The ESM is particularly rich in valuable GAGs such as CS, DS, and HA, which are suitable for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications [157,158].
Compared to animal tissues or microbial fermentation, the relatively simple composition of eggshell, mainly calcium carbonate and proteins, facilitates more efficient extraction [159].
Enzymatic methods like papain‐assisted extraction have demonstrated relatively high yields while preserving GAG purity and bioactivity, highlighting their scalability [160].
Additionally, eggshell‐derived GAGs offer advantages such as low allergenicity, high quality, and environmental compatibility.
Valorizing eggshell waste aligns with circular economy principles, converting underutilized byproducts into valuable resources.
This not only reduces environmental impact and landfill waste but also integrates well into biorefinery models [139,161], indicating eggshell matrix as a vital resource for sustainable GAG production.
Despite the growing interest in eggshell matrix as a sustainable source of GAGs, several regulatory and economic challenges hinder its large‐scale utilization.
One major bottleneck is the high cost and technical complexity of purification for pharmaceutical‐grade purity [42,162].
This is primarily due to structural heterogeneity and the close association of proteins with minerals in the eggshell matrix [163].
Additionally, the absence of market‐standard protocols for extraction, quantification, and structural characterization from this conventional source creates inconsistency and limits commercial scalability.
From a regulatory perspective, bioequivalence and safety validation requirements, especially for therapeutic applications, remain substantial barriers.
Pharmaceutical‐grade GAGs must meet stringent identification, purity, and functional requirements, which currently favor well‐characterized sources like porcine or bovine tissues [164].
These barriers, combined with the relatively low GAG yield associated with many extraction methods and the need for multistep extraction involving decalcification and enzymatic digestion, contribute to the current gap between research potential and industrial adoption.
Enzyme‐assisted extraction of GAGs from the eggshell matrix has demonstrated favorable outputs in terms of yield and bioactivity preservation.
However, the current techniques are constrained by enzyme specificity, cost, and scalability challenges.
Future research efforts should prioritize the development of more efficient, eco‐friendly, and economically feasible extraction techniques.
Key strategies include the integration of novel pretreatment technologies by combining enzymatic hydrolysis with physical treatments, such as ultrasonication, microwave‐assisted extraction, and pulsed electric fields [165,166].
Physical treatments can enhance eggshell matrix disruption and weakening, improve mass transfer, and reduce extraction time, thereby increasing extraction efficiency [167].
Another technique is the use of green solvents and biocatalysis strategies.
The development and adoption of eco‐friendly solvents and tailored immobilized enzymes with enhanced specificity could significantly improve extraction efficiency [168].
In addition, replacing conventional solvents with environmentally friendly solvents (e.g., deep eutectic and ionic solvents) could help maintain product integrity and reduce purification challenges [169].
Furthermore, process intensification strategies could be implemented to optimize process parameters through systematic studies examining the effects of pH, temperature, enzyme concentration, and hydrolysis time on maximizing yield while preserving the structural integrity of GAGs [149].
While current applications of egg‐derived GAGs primarily focus on biomedical uses, future research should investigate their potential use in other industries, such as advanced drug delivery systems, functional biomaterials, and cosmetics.
Eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs possess favorable properties, such as controlled molecular distribution, biocompatibility, and low allergenicity, making them desirable candidates for drug delivery systems in fields such as oncology and regenerative medicine [170].
In cosmetic and dermatological formulations, GAGs from the eggshell matrix can be used in anti‐aging serums, dermal fillers, and skin repair products by capitalizing on the high biocompatibility and moisture retention properties of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs.
For instance, studies indicate that HA from eggshell matrices exhibits regenerative properties, promoting skin cell proliferation and repair [171].
Eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs can be explored to produce functional biomaterials through the development of advanced hybrid materials [172].
This can be achieved by combining eggshell‐derived matrix GAGs with synthetic polymers or other natural biomolecules to create scaffolds with tunable mechanical and biological properties for tissue engineering applications [172,173].
By unlocking these applications, detailed insights into the structure–function relationship, particularly concerning sulfation patterns, molecular conformation, and rheological behavior in composite matrices can be obtained.
To ensure the industrial translation of the sustainable production of GAGs from the eggshell matrix, extensive evaluation of economic viability is crucial, particularly in three main aspects: techno‐economic analysis (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and supply chain optimization.
Regarding TEA, a detailed cost model should be evaluated to provide insights into financial feasibility [174].
This will help evaluate the capital and operating financial inputs for large‐scale enzyme‐catalytic extraction processes, including raw material sourcing, enzyme recycling, and purification infrastructure.
The sustainable scalability prospects of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs should also include an evaluation of environmental impacts by quantifying the carbon footprint, water usage, and energy consumption [175], compared to conventional GAG sources (e.g., animal tissue and marine organisms).
Furthermore, future research could investigate supply chain sustainability strategies concerning the development of efficient collection and logistics networks for eggshell matrix waste and cost–benefit analyses [176,177], particularly of potential coproducts (collagen and calcium salts), which can enhance profits and offset processing costs.
The integration of TEA and LCA with pilot‐scale demonstrations provides essential data for stakeholders and investors, guiding decision‐making and policy support.
The substantial global production of eggshell waste offers a unique opportunity for value addition, as the eggshell matrix contains significant amounts of GAGs, such as HA and CS‐DS copolymers.
These GAGs exhibit advantageous properties, including a narrower MW range and uniform sulfation patterns, leading to more predictable performance in applications.
Eggshell‐derived GAGs also mitigate issues associated with traditional sources, such as contamination risks, allergenicity, and seasonal or geographical dependencies, aligning with sustainable development goals by converting waste into valuable products.
Despite the sustainable potential of eggshell‐derived GAGs, there are key challenges that hinder their large‐scale exploitation, including high purification costs, lack of standardized extraction protocols, and stringent pharmaceutical bioequivalence requirements.
Furthermore, the research is essential to optimize the extraction and purification processes for enhanced yield and cost‐effectiveness.
Standardized quality control measures are needed to ensure consistent GAG characteristics.
It also helps in exploring structure–function relationships which could unlock new applications, and assess the economic and environmental impacts of large‐scale production.
These can help achieve the desired MW distribution and sulfation pattern for intended applications.
The transition to eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs represents a significant step toward a sustainable bioeconomy, offering innovative solutions for waste management while meeting the growing demand for GAGs.
