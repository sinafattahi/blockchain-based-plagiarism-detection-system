Accurate and reliable evaluation of sunscreen performance is necessary to ensure adequate balanced sun protection against ultraviolet light (UV) and high‐energy visible light (HEV), depending on an individual's skin phototype and dermatoses.
The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of methodological considerations for standardized evaluation of sunscreen performance to protect against UVA, especially long UVA1, and HEV.
In an open in vivo study, 6 commercial sunscreens were applied on the backs of subjects (n= 15) to evaluate the performance against UVA and HEV using a robust protocol of hybrid diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (HDRS), based on validated ISO methodology.
High‐resolution absorbance spectra were obtained between 310 and 450 nm using a 1 nm stepsize.
The region 365–450 nm was compared with a method using linear interpolation from four discrete wavelengths (365, 405, 435 and 450 nm).
The sunscreen ranking observed using the in vivo high‐resolution spectral representation (1 nm steps) method was not consistently reproduced by the method using four discrete wavelengths with linear interpolation.
Differences between the two methods were observed in the range of 380–400 nm, leading to misclassification in the rank of protection depending on the methodology used.
The absorption profile in the UVA and HEV light ranges of each sunscreen was determined accurately and reliably by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with measurements every nanometer.
Sunscreen performance characterization will depend on the methodology, and applying linear interpolation from broader wavelength bands may give inaccurate results.
Sunscreens are an essential component of a multifaceted approach to photoprotection, along with protective clothing and seeking shade.
Wavelength ranges on the solar radiation spectrum that are relevant for their impact on skin are ultraviolet (UV), visible light (VL), especially high‐energy blue‐violet visible light (HEV), and infrared A (IRA) (Figure1).
UV radiation and VL represent about 2% and 47% of solar radiation, respectively, and the clinical effects on the skin from the various wavelengths may differ.
UVB rays (290–320 nm) have the highest energy and mostly affect the epidermis.
Although UVA rays have lower energy than UVB, UVA wavelengths (320–400 nm) represent 90% of UV radiation reaching Earth.
Evidence shows that UVA, especially long UVA (UVA1, 340–400 nm), can penetrate into the dermis with several potential clinical consequences; for example, pigmentation, photoaging, photocarcinogenesis, immunosuppression, and photodermatoses [1,2].
Furthermore, UVA1 and VL (400–700 nm), especially HEV light (400–450 nm), may have synergistic effects [3].
HEV exposure induces erythema in light‐skinned individuals, leads to hyperpigmentation in dark‐skinned types, and can worsen hyperpigmentary disorders including melasma, PIH, and actinic lentigos in all skin types [4].
HEV also induces the generation of oxidative stress in the skin that could contribute to photoaging.
The acute and chronic effects of different wavelengths of sunlight (UVB, UVA [including UVA1], VL and infrared [IRA]) on skin will depend on various factors, such as the skin phototype or the presence of dermatoses, but all skin types require well‐balanced photoprotection [5].
Hence, it is important to be able to evaluate sunscreens across the full spectrum of UVB, UVA, and VL, up to IRA.
As clinical effects from UVA and HEV wavelengths are now widely recognized, there is a need for accurate in vivo tests to evaluate sunscreen performance against UVA1 and HEV light, especially at 380–400 nm, as this region is inadequately covered by most commercially available sunscreens.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) gold standard method for the in vivo determination of sunscreen sun protection factor (SPF) measures the erythemal protective efficiency against UV [6].
Various previously published imaging techniques (in vivo and in vitro) have improved our understanding of sunscreen performance at different scales or levels of resolution, for example, polarized photography [7], diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) [7], Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) [8], Raman spectroscopy [9], multiphoton spectral imaging [10], or mass spectrometry (MS) hyperspectral sub‐micron imaging [11].
Multispectral imaging with a small number of broad spectral bands [12,13], or high‐resolution hyperspectral imaging involving narrow, contiguous spectral bands can be used to map UV filters by fluorescence.
Hybrid diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (HDRS) is a hybrid method combining in vitro transmittance measurements of a sunscreen on a roughened polymethylmethacrylate plate (PMMA plate) for the UVB range, and in vivo DRS measurements on the skin for the UVA range [14].
HDRS allows the measurement of UVB sun protection factor (SPF) and UVAPF without requiring exposure to erythemal levels of UV to evaluate sunscreen performance [14,15,16,17].
Furthermore, repeated measurements of sunscreen protection can be obtained with the HDRS methodology more rapidly than was possible with previously developed in vivo methods [18].
Finally, HDRS is an accurate, non‐invasive method, and the robustness has been validated by ISO certification for evaluating sunscreen effectiveness against UVB and UVA [19].
A recent publication described the development of an in vivo method using multispectral imaging, before and after application of sunscreen (dose 1 mg/cm2nonstandard conditions) or a control product on forearm skin, to evaluate the absorption properties in the UV and HEV regions of six sunscreens [12].
Light reflectance spectroscopy of light‐emitting diode (LED) at four discrete wavelengths (365, 405, 435, and 450 nm) was used to generate absorbance curves using linear interpolation [12].
The objective of our study was to evaluate sunscreen performance in the UVA and HEV range using a standardized methodology based on the in vivo part of the HDRS method, as described in ISO 23698:2024 [19].
Although this ISO HDRS method only focuses on UVB and UVA, we were able to acquire accurate and reliable measurements in the UVA and HEV regions as the double monochromator device permits measurements over a wide spectral range up to 450 nm.
Therefore, we designed an in vivo study based on the HDRS robust protocol to generate high‐resolution absorbance curves with 1 nm steps between 310 and 450 nm in the UVA and HEV ranges to compare the performance of six different commercially available organic sunscreens (including one tinted sunscreen with inorganic pigments).
Furthermore, to investigate the importance of methodological considerations for accurate and reproducible sunscreen characterization on the skin, we compared the high‐resolution absorption profiles obtained from measurements every nanometer with the previously described multispectral imaging method [12], which relies on linear interpolation from four discrete data points (at 365, 405, 435, and 450 nm).
This range from 365 to 450 nm is of particular interest since it is inadequately covered by existing ISO methods.
An open in vivo study was conducted by a clinical research organization in Germany from July to August 2024.
The test panel included 15 healthy subjects and adhered to the inclusion and non‐inclusion criteria defined in ISO 23698:2024 [19].
The procedures were followed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.
All subjects provided signed written informed consent before enrollment.
No ethical approval was required since the study was based on a previously approved ISO protocol.
The sunscreens chosen were representative of the European Market, containing different filters covering UVB, UVA, and potentially HEV.
We also included a tinted sunscreen (commercial sunscreen 1) as iron oxides are known to contribute to protection within the HEV waveband.
Table1lists the filters in the six commercially available organic sunscreens (SPF50 or SPF50+); all were tested on the same panel of volunteers.
Test areas of 45 cm2were delineated on the back of each subject, and the sunscreens were randomly assigned to the sites.
Measurements were acquired using a 450 W Xenon lamp as an excitation source, first taken at baseline on naked skin, followed by repeat measurements after sunscreen application on the site at a dose of 2.0 (±0.05) mg/cm2, in line with the ISO 23698:2024 method.

Two methods leveraging diffuse reflectance spectroscopy were compared.
The spectroscopic measurements on the skin were performed using a Bentham double monochromator system (Bentham Instruments Ltd., UK).
On each of the designated test sites, randomly distributed measurements were performed, one before (baseline) and then at least 3 after product application.
In the first HDRS‐based method, spectra were measured in synchronous scan mode from 310 to 450 nm using incremental steps of 1 nm.
The results at 1 nm stepsizes between 365 and 450 nm were compared with a second method using only 4 discrete wavelengths, as previously described by Le Digabel et al. [12], with linear interpolation from measurements at 365 nm (in the UVA waveband), 405, 435, and 450 nm (in the HEV waveband).
Wavelengths were chosen to cover 365–405 (UVA), 380–400 (ultralong UVA), 400–450 (HEV) and 380–450 nm (ultralong UVA and HEV light).
Absorbance spectra were measured before and after product application to evaluate sunscreen performance.
Higher absorbance corresponds to higher sun protection at the respective wavelength, and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the sunscreen performance by the two different methods.
TDRS(λ) = in vivo transmittance spectrum of sunscreen product calculated from DRS as a function of wavelength for each subsite.
Rp(λ) = the individual subsite irradiance of reflectance spectrum of protected skin.
Ru(λ) = the individual subsite irradiance of reflectance spectrum of unprotected skin.
A final average spectrum was calculated for each product (n= 15).
One‐way ANOVA was applied to determine statistically significant differences between formulations (p≤ 0.05) and effect size (the magnitude of the difference relative to its variability).
Differences between formulations were adjusted using Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons.
Pairwise comparisons of the AUC for each sunscreen formulation obtained by the HDRS principle and the linear interpolation method were conducted across four distinct spectral ranges: 365–405 nm, 380–400 nm, 400–450 nm, and 380–450 nm.
A paired‐samplest‐test was performed for each sunscreen formulation across each wavelength range, comparing the AUC for the HDRS‐based method and the linear interpolation method.p‐values and effect sizes were used to evaluate the significance of the observed differences.
The study panel of 15 healthy subjects was aged between 20 and 69 years old and had individual typology angles (ITA°) ranging from 44° to 64°.
We obtained high resolution absorbance curves by DRS analysis of the spectra with 1 nm stepsize from 310 to 450 nm in the UVA (UVA1, UVA2) and HEV ranges for the 6 tested sunscreens (Figure2).

To focus on the absorbance spectra in the UVA1 and HEV regions, high‐resolution results from our method with 1 nm stepsize between 365 and 450 nm (Figure3A) were compared with results from spectral data of only 4 data points at 365, 405, 435, and 450 nm with linear interpolation (Figure3B).

The region 380–400 nm (ultralong UVA) is highlighted to show the spectral inversion of commercial sunscreen 5 and 6.
Focusing on the region between 380 and 400 nm (ultralong UVA1), which is inadequately covered by most commercially available sunscreens, we observed spectral inversion for sunscreens 5 and 6 depending on the method used (highlighted in Figure3A,B); the curve for commercial sunscreen 6 is above commercial sunscreen 5 in Figure3A, but the order is inverted in Figure3B.
To quantify the sunscreen performance, the corresponding AUC was calculated from the respective absorbance profiles of the two different methods to facilitate comparison in the UVA range (365–405 nm), ultralong UVA1 (380–400 nm), HEV (400–450 nm), and UVA1 plus HEV range (380–450 nm).
For each spectral range, the AUC calculated using 1 nm resolution is shown in Figure4A, and the AUC from linear interpolation from 4 data points is shown in Figure4B.
AUC were ranked in decreasing order, and significant differences were confirmed by statistical analysis (t‐testp< 0.05) and specified on the graphs.

*Statistical significance (p≤ 0.05) between products.
In the HEV range (400–450 nm) and in the UVA1 plus HEV range (380–450 nm), we observed the highest absorbance with commercial sunscreen 1 (tinted) for both methods (see Figures3and4).
In the UVA range (365–405 nm) and in the ultralong UVA1 range (380–400 nm), commercial sunscreens 1, 2, and 3 showed the highest absorbance for both methods (Figures3and4).
Commercial sunscreen 2 was the highest‐ranked non‐tinted, organic sunscreen across the ranges 365–405 nm, 380–400 nm, and 380–450 nm using the accurate high‐resolution method with a 1 nm stepsize.
Comparing the AUCs for both methods (Figure4A,B), specifically in the 380–400 nm range and the 365–405 nm range, the order of commercial sunscreens 5 and 6 is inversed depending on the method.
The shoulder feature observed in the high‐resolution method (see Figure3A) was not captured in the interpolation method.
This discrepancy resulted in a statistically significantly smaller AUC for sunscreen 6 versus sunscreen 5 with the interpolated 4‐point method, whereas it was ranked statistically significantly better than sunscreen 5 using the high‐resolution method, specifically in the 380–400 nm range.
In the HEV range of 400–450 nm, absorbance was lower for all sunscreens, and the order of sunscreen ranking was different using the 1 nm stepsize high‐resolution method than with the interpolation method (Figure4A,B).
However, the differences in ranking were not all statistically significant; for example, the difference between sunscreen 5 and sunscreen 2 was nonsignificant (p= 0.216) when evaluated with the 1 nm stepsize high‐resolution method in the HEV range of 400–450 nm.
The confidence intervals of the mean difference between both methods for each spectral range and product are shown in Figure5.
Significant differences were observed between both methods for all products and for the four spectral ranges (except for the non‐statistically significant difference for product 6 in the 380–450 nm range).

The linear interpolation method consistently yielded larger AUCs across all four investigated wavelength ranges for commercial sunscreen 5 than when evaluated using the more accurate high‐resolution method with 1 nm stepsize.
In the HEV range of 400–450 nm, all the AUCs for all sunscreens were smaller with the high‐resolution method than with the interpolation method.
The in vivo high‐resolution spectral representation (1 nm), based on the HDRS method, allowed accurate evaluation of the absorption profile of each sunscreen product in the UVA and HEV light ranges.
To move towards harmonization and standardization of in vivo sunscreen testing, we applied standardized parameters (as defined in ISO23698:2024), such as the amount of sunscreen applied (2 mg/cm2) and the location of sunscreen application on the back of subjects.
To highlight the importance of obtaining high resolution absorbance curves, we compared our high‐resolution method including all 1 nm points with results obtained when we removed data points from the original spectra to keep only data for 4 discrete wavelengths at 365, 405, 435, and 450 nm; these four wavelengths were selected to reproduce a previously published linear interpolation method [12].
While the previous method described by Le Digabel et al. [12] only calculated the AUC for the range 380–450 nm (which they designated as extended HEV), we measured the AUC across four ranges to cover UVA1 (365–405 nm), ultra‐long UVA (380–400 nm), ultralong UVA plus HEV light (380–450 nm), and HEV light (400–450).
Ultra‐long UVA (380–400 nm) is important because it is inadequately covered by most marketed sunscreens.
We evaluated six sunscreen formulations and ranked the AUCs obtained from the absorbance curves using both methods, with a larger AUC indicating better protection at the respective wavelength.
Commercial sunscreen 1 had the highest mean absorbance in ranges of 400–450 nm (HEV) and the range 380–450 nm (see Figures2and3A), which may be expected as this is a tinted sunscreen containing inorganic iron oxides in its composition, which are known to provide protection against VL [20].
Until recently, only tinted sunscreens containing iron oxide or pigmentary titanium dioxide protected against UVA1 and VL [21,22].
However, recent technological advances have led to the development of new compounds providing some attenuation in the HEV light range, providing possible alternatives to tinted sunscreens [23,24].
Hence, standardized methods are essential to ensure accurate and reliable evaluation of the absorption spectra of these new sunscreen formulations.
Commercial sunscreen 2 was the highest ranked non‐tinted, organic sunscreen across the ranges 365–405 nm, 380–400 nm, and 380–450 nm using the accurate high‐resolution method with 1 nm stepsize.
In the HEV range (400–450 nm), the non‐tinted, organic commercial sunscreens showed lower absorbance than in the other ranges, and there were differences in sunscreen ranking between the two methods.
We observed an inversion of sunscreen ranking for sunscreen 5 and 6, notably in the region 380–400 nm, depending on the method.
Interestingly, across all four investigated wavelength ranges, commercial sunscreen 5 consistently yielded a larger AUC when evaluated using the linear interpolation method than with the more accurate high‐resolution method with 1 nm stepsize, suggesting that the linear interpolation method gave misleading results for this sunscreen.
Hence, using linear interpolation from a limited number of wavelengths may influence the performance ranking of some sunscreens.
In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of using a standardized high‐resolution method for the evaluation of sunscreen performance across the UVA and HEV spectrum rather than a method relying on linear interpolation from measurements at only four discrete wavelengths.
This full spectrum high‐resolution method allows a precise evaluation of the protection level of sunscreen products.
The clinical and regulatory relevance of the differences observed remains to be addressed.
