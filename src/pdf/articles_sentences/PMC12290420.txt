Ethiopia has a significant number of sheep and goats, though the benefit gained is little because of several diseases, including Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR).
PPR is a highly contagious and economically important transboundary disease of small ruminants, associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.
A cross‐sectional study was conducted to estimate seroprevalence of PPR and identify associated risk factors in four Kebeles of the Pawe district, Northwest Ethiopia.
A total of 334 serum samples (146 from goats and 188 from sheep) were collected and tested for PPRV antibodies using competitive ELISA (c‐ELISA).
Out of a total of 334 blood sera from sheep and goats tested for PPR virus antibodies, 236 (70.7%) were positive.
There was no significant difference in prevalence between sheep (71.3%) and goats (69.9%).
A significantly higher PPRV seroprevalence was observed in female sheep (75.7%) compared to male sheep (55%).
Similarly, female goats had a higher prevalence (74.4%) than male goats (48%) (pvalue = 0.01).
The prevalence was also significantly higher in lactating female sheep (81.8%) and goats (83.3%).
Age‐wise, seroprevalence was higher in older sheep (82.2%, odds ratios [OR] = 4.4) and older goats (84.1%, OR = 5.4) than their younger counterparts.
The prevalence was higher in Almu Kebele (82.5%) (χ2= 7.5,pvalue = 0.05).
Flock size, age, body condition, origin and the introduction of new animals were identified as potential risk factors associated with the prevalence.
PPR is highly prevalent in the district, indicating significant circulation of the virus in the area.
This high prevalence, combined with the regular movement of animals and shared grazing lands in the area, poses a risk for the further spread of the disease.
Therefore, priority should be given to the area in control and eradication efforts, along with restrictions on animal movement and targeted vaccination.
❖ The overall antibody seroprevalence of PPRV in the district was 70.7% (236/334) with nonsignificant difference in the prevalence between sheep (71.3%) and goats (69.9%).
❖ Highest Kebele‐wise overall antibody seroprevalence of PPRV was recorded in Almu (82.5%), followed by Mender 14 (68.7%), and the lowest seroprevalence was recorded from Mender 23/45 Kebele (64.6%).
❖ Age, physiological status, sex, Kebele and housing system of the shoats were significantly associated with seropositivity of small ruminants to PPRV antibodies.
Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known as goat plague, is a highly contagious and economically significant viral disease caused by the PPR virus (PPRV), a member of theMorbillivirusgenus in the Paramyxoviridae family (Dundon et al.2020).
First reported in Côte d'Ivoire in 1942 (Gargadennec and Lalanne1942), PPR primarily affects sheep and goats, causing high morbidity and mortality rates, and poses a major threat to smallholder farmers who rely on small ruminants for their livelihoods and food security (Munir et al.2013; Swai et al.2009).
The disease can cause mortality rates of up to 90% in naïve herds, leading to devastating consequences for rural economies (Fentie et al.2018).
Furthermore, PPR outbreaks often result in the loss of valuable genetic resources, as indigenous breeds of goats and sheep are particularly susceptible to the disease (Albina et al.2013).
PPR is characterized by symptoms such as fever, conjunctivitis, oculo‐nasal discharges, necrotizing stomatitis, diarrhoea, bronchopneumonia and high mortality.
However, tentative diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs and postmortem lesions; confirmation requires isolation, serological or molecular methods (Balamurugan et al.2014).
The disease spreads through direct contact or inhalation of respiratory droplets from infected animals, with asymptomatic carriers shedding the virus for up to 12 weeks or longer (Ishag et al.2015).
PPR is endemic across Africa, the Middle East and Asia, affecting over 1.7 billion sheep and goats and destabilizing the livelihoods, food security and nutrition of 330 million people reliant on small ruminant production (OIE and Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]2015; Munibullah et al.2024).
The emergence of the disease in Europe, in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and most recently in Hungary, also highlights its growing threat to Europe's economy (Cirad2025).
It causes significant economic losses because of its highly contagious nature.
Economically, PPR devastates vulnerable livelihoods and national livestock sectors, with annual losses per country ranging from millions to hundreds of millions of USD.
For instance, Nigeria, India, Kenya and Iran incur losses of 1.5, 39, 15 and 1.5 million, respectively (Robi2019).
Globally, annual economic losses total $1.45–$2.1 billion due to mortality, reduced productivity and control measures like vaccination, with Africa bearing nearly half and South Asia a quarter of these losses (OIE and FAO2021; Senbeto2022).
In response to the global threat posed by PPR, the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) launched the Global Control and Eradication Strategy for PPR in 2015.
The initiative aims to eradicate the disease by 2030 through mass vaccination campaigns, improved surveillance and capacity building in affected countries (OIE and FAO2015).
A cost–benefit analysis study done in 2016 revealed that eradicating PPR could yield $74.2 billion in net benefits, with all models confirming its cost‐effectiveness (Jones et al.2016).
PPR was first suspected in Ethiopia's goat herds in 1977 and confirmed in 1991 using a cDNA probe (Gebre et al.2018).
Since then, it has caused significant economic losses and worsened food insecurity, particularly in vulnerable regions (Woldemichael et al.2018; Dundon et al.2020).
In response, Ethiopia is working towards the global 2030 eradication target, aligning with the Pan‐African PPR Eradication Programme (2023–2027) led by the African Union Commission (AUC), AU‐IBAR and AU‐PANVAC.
Between 2016 and 2019, Ethiopia vaccinated over 24.5 million small ruminants in high‐risk areas and aims to achieve PPR‐free status by 2027 using live attenuated vaccines (Wendimu et al.2024; AU‐IBAR2025).
Despite challenges such as logistical issues, cold chain management and limited funding, Ethiopia is collaborating with international partners such as FAO and WOAH to strengthen infrastructure, improve vaccine delivery and secure sustainable funding, ensuring alignment with both continental and global eradication goals.
The FAO and the Federal Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MoLF) have reaffirmed their commitment to eradicating PPR from the pastoral lowland areas of Ethiopia (FAO2025).
Effective control and eradication require a clear understanding of the disease's epidemiology.
Between 2016 and 2021, Ethiopia reported 632 PPR outbreaks, resulting in 255,794 cases and 116,341 deaths (Senbeto et al.2024).
Numerous seroprevalence studies on PPRV have been conducted in various regions of Ethiopia (Delil et al.2012; Afera et al.2014; Gebre et al.2018; Hailegebreal2018; Agga et al.2019; Yalew et al.2019; Gelana et al.2020; Abesha et al.2023; Senbeto et al.2024).
However, limited information is available on the seroepidemiology of PPR in the present study area, where the disease is endemic, as indicated by regular clinical observations and prior research in Northwest Ethiopia (Abesha et al.2023).
Therefore, this study aims to estimate seroprevalence and identify risk factors associated with PPR in small ruminants of Pawe district.
The study was conducted in the Pawe district of Metekel Zone, Benishangul Gumuz Regional State (see Figure1).
Metekel is located 567 km northwest of Addis Ababa between 9.9 and 12.5° N latitudes and 34.9 and 36.6° E longitudes.
The zone encompasses a total area of 25,705 km2and has a road density of 28.4 km per 1000 km2.
The altitudes of the zone range from 300 to 2700 m, experiencing an average minimum and maximum annual temperature of 23°C and 31.1°C respectively (Metekel zone department of agriculture).
Pawe district is found at an elevation of 1064 m above sea level, with coordinates of 11°15′24.7″ N latitude and 36°23′10″ E longitudes.
The district comprises 20 Kebeles that cover an area of about 64,300 ha and have an estimated population of 59,127 residents.
The district's temperature ranges from 19.4°C to 37.6°C, with annual rainfall fluctuating between 1186 and 1977 mm.
The local economy primarily relies on a combination of crop‐livestock production (Asmamaw and Getachew2016; Berhanu et al.2018).
Pawe has a livestock population of 6862 sheep and 7868 goats, according to the 2020 unpublished annual report from the district's agricultural office.
The study population for this study was sheep and goats found in the Pawe district.
Only sheep and goats older than 6 months and non‐vaccinated were considered to eliminate the possibility of seropositivity results from maternal antibodies and vaccination.
Animals of both sexes and all body conditions were included.
Flock sizes of the animals were classified as large (more than 20 animals), medium (10–20 animals) and small (fewer than 10 animals) according to Gebre et al. (2018). The age of the sheep and goats was determined by asking the owner and by examining their dentition, following the criteria established by ESGPIP (2009a), they and were categorized as young (less than 1 year), adult (1–3 years) and old (greater than 3 years).
The body condition of the animals was also assessed, recorded and grouped as poor, medium and good based on the ESGPIP (2009b) manual.
This study used a cross‐sectional study design that was conducted from January 2021 to May 2021 to determine the seroprevalence of PPRV antibodies and to identify associated risk factors in the Pawe district.
wherenrepresents the sample size required for the study,pexpis the expected seroprevalence, anddis the absolute level of precision.
Accordingly, a sample size of 300 sheep and goats was required.
However, to enhance the precision of the sample estimate, a total of 334 small ruminants (188 sheep and 146 goats) were included in the study.
From the study district, four Kebeles, namely, Almu, Mender 23–45, Mender 14 and Mender 50, were purposively selected based on a history of PPR occurrence and small ruminant potential.
Lists of peasant associations (PAs) found within the Kebeles were obtained, and three to four PAs were randomly selected for the study.
The number of sheep and goats sampled was proportionally allocated to each Kebele.
Farmers with sheep and goats were selected from each PA using a systematic sampling method.
Simple random sampling was then used to select the individual animals by lottery system.
After carefully restraining the study animals, blood samples were collected using clot activator plain vacutainer tubes (BD vacutainer, Becton, Dickinson and Company, UK).
Briefly, the jugular vein area was disinfected with 70% alcohol, and 5 mL of blood was collected from the vein using a venoject needle and vacutainer tubes.
The collected samples were labelled and transported to a laboratory in a cool icebox for temporary storage.
During the sample collection, age, sex, species, body condition, place of sample collection and vaccination status of the animals were recorded.
Additional factors, such as herd size, housing conditions, the origin of the animals, physiological status, grazing management, presence of inter‐herd contact, recent introduction of new animals and isolation practices of infected small ruminants, were also documented during sampling.
Upon arriving at the laboratory, the samples were allowed to stand in a slant position overnight at room temperature to facilitate serum separation.
Samples from which serum had not clearly separated were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min to remove any remaining red blood cells and obtain clear serum.
The serum was then harvested using a sterile micropipette, transferred into cryogenic vials (Nalgene cryo‐ware, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20°C in aliquots for serological analysis.
The collected sera samples were tested using the ID screen PPR competition ELISA (c‐ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ID Vet Innovative Diagnostics, France).
In brief, 25 µL of dilution buffer was added to each microplate well, followed by the addition of 25 µL positive and 25 µL of negative controls to the specific wells.
Subsequently, 25 µL of each dispensed sample was added to the remaining wells, which were then sealed with adhesive plate sealants and incubated at 37°C for 45 min.
The plate wells were washed with 300 µL working wash solution, and a 100 µL of 1× conjugate solution was added to each well.
The plates were then re‐incubated at 21°C for 30 min and washed again with the wash solution.
Following this, 100 µL of substrate solution was added to the plates, and they were incubated at 21°C in the dark for 15 min.
Finally, 100 µL of stop solution was added to halt the enzymatic reaction, and the optical density (OD) of the samples was read at 450 nm using the ELx800 ELISA reader (BioTek Instruments, USA).
The competition percentage (S/N%) of the samples was computed using Gen 5 3.04 software, and the results were categorized as positive (S/N% ≤50%), negative (S/N% >60%) and doubtful (S/N% >50% and <60%).
The data were coded using Microsoft Excel 2010 and analysed using R 4.0.2 software.
Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the data and to compute prevalence.
The chi‐square test (χ2) was used to evaluate differences in prevalence among various risk factors.
Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to assess the risk factors associated with the prevalence of PPR.
For the regression analysis, all variables were included initially, and the model was simplified using a backward stepwise method.
The strength of the association between the variables and the PPRV seropositivity was estimated using odds ratios (OR), whereaspvalues were used to evaluate the significance of these associations.
A significant difference was considered to exist if the computedpvalue was less than 0.05.
The map of the study area was created using QGIS version 3.20.1.
Out of the total 334 sera samples tested for PPRV antibodies, 236 (70.7%) were found to be positive.
The highest Kebele‐wise overall antibody seroprevalence of PPRV was observed in Almu (82.5%), followed by Mender 14 (68.7%), whereas the lowest seroprevalence was recorded in Mender 23/45 Kebele (64.6%) (pvalue = 0.05).
The prevalence in sheep was significantly higher in Mender 14 (81.4%), and the prevalence in goats was higher in Almu kebele (90.5%,pvalue < 0.05) (Table1).

The antibody prevalence was almost similar in sheep (71.3%) and goats (69.9%) (pvalue > 0.87).
However, it was significantly higher in older sheep (82.2%,χ2= 14) and older goats (84.1%,χ2= 12).
The prevalence was also higher in female sheep (75.7%) and female goats (74.4%) (pvalue = 0.01).
Significantly higher prevalence rates were observed in lactating goats (83.3%) and sheep (81.8%), followed by pregnant goats (70.2%) and sheep (75.4%).
The prevalence was also significantly higher in sheep from medium flock sizes and goats from mixed housing systems (Table2).

The seroprevalence of PPRV was 5.3 times higher in sheep and 6.9 times higher in goats from Almu compared to those from Mender 23/45 of the same species.
The odds of being seropositive were also significantly higher in adult sheep (OR = 5.1) and older goats (OR = 5.4) compared to their younger counterparts (pvalue < 0.05).
Additionally, PPR seroprevalence was significantly higher in sheep from medium‐sized flocks than in those from small‐sized flocks.
The probability of goats being infected increased when new animals were introduced (Table3).

The present study showed an overall seroprevalence of 70.7% in both sheep and goats in the Pawe district, which is consistent with previous findings of 73.45% in the Metekel zone (Woldemichael et al.2018) and 75.7% in Asosa zone (Yalew et al.2019), Benishangul Gumuz regional state.
The current finding was also in‐line with that of Zahur et al. (2008) in Pakistan (74.9%), Saritha et al. (2014) in India (67.9%) and Senbeto et al. (2024) in Ethiopia (60.8%).
However, it is higher than the findings of previous studies conducted in various regions of Ethiopia: 47.5% in Tigray (Afera et al.2014), 48.43% in Oromia (Gari et al.2017), 55.34% in Amhara (Fentie et al.2018) and 32.5% in Benishangul‐Gumuz (Abesha et al.2023).
A much lower prevalence was also reported by Bonny et al. (2011), Salih et al. (2014), Gebre et al. (2018) and Hailegebreal (2018). The difference in the prevalence may be attributed to differences in sample size, the geography of the areas, the sheep and goat population in the areas and the production system.
The present study found no significant difference in seroprevalence between sheep (71.3%) and goats (69.9%).
In agreement with this finding, Gelana et al. (2020) reported a non‐significantly higher seroprevalence of 6.98% in sheep and 4.53% in goats, much lower than the current findings.
Gizaw et al. (2018) also reported a slightly higher prevalence in sheep (41.5%) than in goats (39.3%).
In contrast, Salih et al. (2014) found a non‐significantly higher seroprevalence in goats (47.9%) than in sheep (43.7%).
A slightly higher prevalence of 57.6% (Luka et al.2011) and 34.7% (Abesha et al.2023) were also observed in goats.
The absence of significant variation could be attributed to the equal probability of exposure among the animals, resulting from their unrestricted movement, shared grazing lands and herding the flocks together.
On the other hand, Al‐Majali et al. (2008) in Jordan, Kihu et al. (2015) in Kenya and Hailegebreal (2018) in Ethiopia documented a significantly higher prevalence of 49%, 40% and 34%, respectively, in goats compared to sheep.
This might be due to the higher fecundity and susceptibility of goats to the virus (Senbeto2022).
The current prevalence of 71.3% in sheep is lower than the previous reports from the Benishangul Gumuz region of Ethiopia (83.3%) by Yalew et al. (2019) and from Sudan (84.5%) by Osman et al. (2018). However, it is in agreement with the findings of Senbeto et al. (2024) (61.9%) in the Awi zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia, and Akwongo et al. (2022) (73.9%) in the Karamoja region of Uganda.
The findings of Saeed et al. (2010) in Sudan (67.2%), El‐Yuguda et al. (2013) in Nigeria (73.2%), Saritha et al. (2014) in India (65.3%), Shuaib et al. (2014) in Sudan (70.2%) and Saeed et al. (2018) in Sudan (65.8%) also concur with this report.
In contrast, the current prevalence is significantly higher than the findings of Megersa et al. (2011) (29.5%), Delil et al. (2012) (0.3%), Fentie et al. (2018) (14.8%) and Hailegebreal2018(24.2%) in Ethiopia.
Furthermore, Abesha et al. (2023) reported a lower prevalence of 34.7% in the Metekel zone of Benishangul Gumuz, Northwest Ethiopia.
The observed variation in prevalence could result from differences in the vaccination status of the animals, patterns of PPR occurrence, management practices and the agroecological conditions of the study locations.
The present seroprevalence in goats (69.9%) aligns closely with the findings of Saritha et al.2014(70.37%), Abdellatif et al.2016(62.9%) and Bello et al.2016(73.8%).
However, it is lower than the finding of Nizamani et al. (2015), who reported a prevalence of 82.7% in goats.
On the other hand, the current finding is much higher than the reports of Waret‐szkuta et al. (2008) in Afar (9.4%), Michael et al. (2017) in Oromia (32.1%), Gebre et al. (2018) in Bench Maji and Kafa zones of Southwest Ethiopia (2.3%) and Agga et al. (2019) in Amhara (9.6%) regions of Ethiopia.
Afera et al. (2014), Swai et al. (2009) and Enan et al. (2013) also reported lower prevalence rates in Ethiopia (47.5%), Tanzania (49.5%) and Sudan (19%), respectively.
The differences in the prevalence might be attributed to variations in the clinical conditions of the sampled animals, sample sizes, agroecological factors and the sampling methods employed.
The current study revealed a higher prevalence in older sheep (82.2%, OR = 4.4,pvalue = 0.003) and older goats (84.1%, OR = 5.4,pvalue = 0.002) than in younger counterparts in the same species.
In agreement with this finding, Khan et al. (2008) reported a significantly higher prevalence in older sheep (78.67%) and older goats (66.15%).
Similarly, Shyaka et al. (2021) noted a higher seroprevalence of 19.8% in older sheep and 21.6% in older goats.
Furthermore, studies in Afar (Gari et al.2017) and Benishangul Gumuz (Yalew et al.2019) regions of Ethiopia reported an increased likelihood of seropositivity with the advancing age of sheep and goats.
Research by Salih et al. (2014), Torsson et al. (2017) and Lysholm et al. (2022) also documented a higher prevalence of 19.6%, 68.7% and 12% in older animals, respectively.
The parallel increase in prevalence with age may result from greater susceptibility after 5 months due to declining maternal antibodies, as well as increased pathogen exposure over time.
Older animals are more likely to have higher seroprevalence because of age‐related immune decline, further increasing their susceptibility to infections (Gebre et al.2018).
Sex‐wise, the current study revealed significantly higher antibody prevalence in female sheep (75.7%) and female goats (74.4%) (pvalue = 0.01).
This finding aligns with the findings of Mahamat et al. (2018), who reported higher seroprevalences of 60.8% in female sheep and 49.8% in goats.
A study in Pakistan by Khan et al. (2008) also showed a significantly higher prevalence in female sheep (65.2%) and female goats (59.24%), consistent with the current findings.
Likewise, earlier study Kenya (Kihu et al.2015) disclosed a higher prevalence of 44% in female goats (pvalue < 0.05).
Moreover, a non‐significantly higher prevalence of 51.5% in female sheep and 49% in female goats was also documented in the Oromia region of Ethiopia (Gari et al.2017).
The higher prevalence in females may be linked to the common practice of retaining them for extended breeding periods while selling or slaughtering males at younger ages.
Additionally, increased pathogen exposure during mating, pregnancy and lactation, as well as immune suppression caused by pregnancy and lactation, likely contribute to this higher seroprevalence.
Physiological status‐wise, the present study revealed higher PPRV antibody prevalence in lactating goats (83.3%) and sheep (81.8%), followed by pregnant sheep (75.4%) and goats (70.2%).
This could be attributed to the increased exposure of females to the disease due to stress from lambing/kidding and pregnancy.
During lactation, pregnancy and lambing or kidding, the immune status of females is lowered, making them more susceptible to PPRV infection (Kihu et al.2015; Nizamani et al.2015; Rume et al.2020).
In contrast to this finding, Senbeto et al. (2024) reported a non‐significantly higher prevalence in adult males, followed by pregnant (66%) and lactating (65.5%) females.
This discrepancy might be attributed to the increased contact rate of the adults with females during mating and the usual inter/intra‐herd interactions contributing to the higher prevalence, or it might result from differences in the number of categories of animals sampled.
The present study identified body condition, flock size and age as potential risk factors for seropositivity in sheep.
Age, origin of the animals, introduction of new animals and housing system were also significantly associated with PPR seroprevalence in goats.
These results are consistent with the earlier study findings (Senbeto et al.2024), which revealed age, body condition and flock size as potential variables associated with the prevalence.
Similarly, Yalew et al. (2019) demonstrated a significant association of age and body condition with seroprevalence.
Previous studies in Ethiopia have also revealed the origin of the animals (Abesha et al.2023; Kumbe et al.2024) and the introduction of new animals (Mbyuzi et al.2014; Gebre et al.2018; Senbeto et al.2024) as a potential risk factor for PPR prevalence.
The antibody prevalence was significantly higher in sheep from medium flock size (95%) compared to those from large (68.8%) and small flock (68.4%) sizes.
The odds of seropositivity in sheep from medium flock sizes were 9.7 times higher than in those from small flock sizes.
In‐line with this finding, Kumbe et al. (2024) and Senbeto et al. (2024) reported a significantly higher prevalence of 74.2% (OR = 15.4) and 67.4% (OR = 4.5) in animals from medium flock sizes, respectively.
Gelana et al. (2020) also found 5.9 times higher odds of seropositivity in medium flock sizes compared to small flock sizes.
The lower seroprevalence in large flock sizes and the much higher seroprevalence observed in medium flock sizes could be attributed to the limited proportion of animals sampled for each category.
In terms of the housing system, a significantly higher proportion of PPRV antibodies were detected in goats housed on the floor together with sheep, followed by those housed separately on the floor (71%) and separately on a bed (59.4%).
This finding is supported by a study in selected districts of the Awi zone (Senbeto et al.2024), which reported a higher prevalence in mixed housing systems (64.7%).
The probability of goats housed with sheep on the floor was 5.4 times higher than in those housed separately on the floor.
This finding is consistent with that of Kardjadj et al. (2015), who reported a higher seroprevalence in mixed flocks (56.9%, OR = 2.64).
In contrast, a study in the Horu Guduru Zone of Western Ethiopia (Gelana et al.2020) revealed a higher prevalence of 5.9% in separately housed goats (OR = 2.1).
Studies in Pakistan (Zahur et al.2011) and Jordan (Al‐Majali et al.2008) also disclosed housing sheep and goats together as a potential risk factor for PPR infection.
This study was designed to minimize bias and error through robust sampling, a validated diagnostic technique (c‐ELISA) and sufficient data collection.
However, several limitations must be noted.
Although PPR vaccination histories were considered in selecting Kebeles to exclude vaccinated animals, the absence of a DIVA vaccine and vaccination practices in some Kebeles and neighbouring districts may have led to the inclusion of vaccinated animals.
This is especially true for animals from external sources, as owners often lack clear vaccination records, which may introduce bias.
Additionally, the unbalanced representation of groups, such as flock sizes and sex, may impact the validity of the results.
The present study found a high seroprevalence of PPRV antibodies in the Pawe district of the Metekel zone.
Flock size and body condition are identified as potential risk factors for seropositivity in sheep, whereas the introduction of new animals, their origin and housing systems are risk factors for goats.
Additionally, Kebele and age are variables strongly associated with the prevalence in both species.
The high seroprevalence in the district indicates active circulation of PPRV in the area.
Factors such as unrestricted animal movement, communal grazing systems and extensive farming systems in the area may contribute to the higher prevalence and further spread of the disease.
This poses a significant continuous challenge to small ruminant production, necessitating urgent attention to control the disease through the implementation of effective prevention and control measures.
Therefore, it is crucial to strictly implement disease control measures in this area to effectively manage and mitigate the disease's impact.
Additionally, further studies on the molecular detection and sequencing of the circulating virus are essential.
