The rising prevalence of advanced illness poses growing challenges for family caregivers, requiring healthcare professionals to address an increasing array of caregiver needs.
This systematic review explores the impact of at‐home interventions for caregivers supporting individuals with advanced illness, examining intervention characteristics and methodological quality.
Quantitative studies published over the past 5 years (2019–2024) were sourced from PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.
Intervention data, including modality, components, timing, providers, recipients, and caregiver outcomes, were systematically reviewed.
Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2 and ROBINS‐I.
From 16 studies, key caregiver needs such as depression, anxiety, distress, quality of life, burden, and caregiving self‐efficacy emerged as primary areas addressed.
The majority of interventions were face‐to‐face, nurse‐led, and aimed at primary caregivers.
Findings underscore the importance of personalized interventions that consider caregivers' unique responses and actively involve them in design.
Nurses play a crucial role in leading these interventions, positioning them as central to enhancing caregiver support in home settings.
Across Europe, more than 4.4 million people die each year from conditions associated with serious health‐related suffering, often in the advanced stages of chronic illness.
This represents a significant challenge for health systems in meeting the needs of individuals with advanced illness and their families (Garralda et al.2025).
Advanced illness refers to a spectrum of clinical conditions marked by progressive decline in health and functional status, limited response to curative treatments, and increasing care complexity (Hopp and Nedjat‐Haiem2019; Sercu et al.2018).
It encompasses the later stages of chronic illness—including terminal and end‐of‐life phases—and reflects a trajectory in which symptom burden intensifies and quality of life becomes the central focus of care (Brar et al.2023; Kuharic et al.2024).
Rather than being restricted to a specific moment near death, advanced illness captures the evolving and overlapping nature of serious illness, promoting a shared understanding that supports continuity of care across settings and over time (Leung and Zehm2022; Garcia et al.2023).
While these types of deaths predominantly occur in healthcare facilities, there is an increasing trend of dying in the comfort of one's own home (Morris et al.2015).
In fact, many deaths that occur in hospitals go against the wishes of these patients, as most of them would prefer to die at home surrounded by their family and loved ones (Ali et al.2019; Higginson et al.2017).
Hence, there has been a steady increase in the availability of end‐of‐life care at home in recent years (Arias‐Casais et al.2020; Kjellstadli et al.2018).
In this context, it has been shown that the likelihood that patients with advanced illness will spend the end of their lives at home mainly depends on the effort and capacity of the family members in charge of their care (Dowd et al.2023; Martín‐Martín et al.2022).
In this regard, family members are responsible for providing most of the physical and emotional care, symptom management, and organization and coordination of health services on behalf of the patient (Zavagli et al.2019).
Thus, the family is the backbone of end‐of‐life care (Stajduhar2013), providing approximately 80% of at‐home care for advanced patients (Martín‐Martín et al.2016; Morris et al.2015).
Although home care has benefits for patients and families by fostering feelings of freedom (Collier et al.2015) and providing a deeper sense of human existence and appreciation of life (Akpan‐Idiok and Anarado2014), it has also been shown to have a significant impact on the physical, psychological, and emotional well‐being of families (Martín‐Martín et al.2022).
The entire family faces challenges and crises when dealing with numerous issues in managing the life of their loved one, including symptom management and hospital admissions (Martín‐Martín et al.2016).
In addition, evidence has shown that family members feel unprepared to take on these responsibilities and experience a significant lack of confidence, as they are unaware of the caregiving tasks and challenges of assuming the role of caregiver (Mason and Hodgkin2019; Soroka et al.2018).
Previous studies have analyzed the provision of support for family caregivers without delimiting the place where the care was provided (Chi et al.2016; Harding et al.2012) and have focused on a single professional group (e.g., nurses) (Becqué et al.2019) or a specific advanced illness (e.g., terminal cancer) (Ahn et al.2020), limiting the generalizability of the findings.
In response to the increasing demands and needs expressed by family caregivers who assist a relative with advanced illness at home, this systematic review was undertaken with the primary objective of identifying and evaluating the impact of existing interventions within this context, regardless of the type of advanced illness of the loved one or the disciplines involved in their implementation.
Additionally, the secondary objectives were to analyze the methodological quality of the existing interventions and to examine the specific characteristics and components of these interventions.
The study was preregistered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (under registration number CRD42024594627) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) protocol (Page et al.2021).
The Population, Interventions, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) method was used to formulate the research question and guide the identification of search terms (Eriksen and Frandsen2018).
As specified in the registered protocol, the outcome domains were defined a priori within this framework, informed by the research team's previous qualitative studies on the phenomenon under investigation (Martín‐Martín et al.2016; Martín‐Martín et al.2022; Martín‐Martín et al.2025).
However, this a priori specification did not preclude the identification of additional outcome domains that emerged inductively from the included studies, thereby allowing the review to capture a broader range of effects reported in the literature.
Guided by the PICO structure, the literature search was conducted between March and April 2023, and the data were updated in August 2024.
Five electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) were searched with the keywords“interventions,” “family caregiver,” “advanced illness,”and“home”identified from MeSH terms, a thesaurus, and the literature.
These words and their synonyms were combined with the Booleans“AND”and“OR,”as shown in Figure1(see AppendixAfor the search string).

The key terms used were“interventions”,“family caregiver”,“advanced illness”, and“home”, along with their synonyms, appropriately combined using boolean operators“AND”and“OR”.
This search strategy was replicated across the different databases consulted (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library).
The Mendeley reference management tool was used for data management throughout the systematic review.
All citations were imported, and duplicates were removed using Covidence.
Two researchers independently screened records by publication date and language, assessed titles and abstracts, and evaluated full texts for eligibility.
Articles were selected according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table1).
Any discrepancies were discussed in group meetings involving all three authors until consensus was reached.
The PRISMA flow diagram was applied to document and report the selection process (see Figure2).

After screening, identifying, and assessing the quality of the selected studies, data were extracted using a pre‐prepared form by researchers.
The extracted information included authors and date of the study, country and place where the study was conducted, characteristics of the participants, study design, conceptual framework (understood as the theoretical model or rationale explicitly used to guide the design of the intervention and to explain its expected mechanisms of action (Van der Waldt2024)), type of intervention (duration, mode of delivery, and the providers and recipients of the interventions), outcomes (variables measured, instruments used, efficacy of the interventions and conclusions of the original authors), and quality of the selected studies (see Table2).
The data extraction process was performed independently by the first (LSG) and third authors (JMM).
A final check of the data was made by the second author (MOL).

Methodological quality was determined using theCochrane Risk of Bias 2(RoB 2) tool (Sterne et al.2019) for randomized clinical trials and theRisk of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions(ROBINS‐I) tool (Sterne et al.2016) for nonrandomized studies.
Based on the assessment of each item, the overall risk of bias in a study was evaluated as low risk of bias, some concerns, or high risk of bias (Sterne et al.2019); and as low, moderate, serious, critical risk of bias, or no information (Sterne et al.2016), respectively.
The selection, review, and quality assessment of the studies were independently performed by two authors (LSG and JMM), both of whom had prior training and experience in using the assessment tools.
Each author performed the assessments separately and blinded to the other's evaluations.
The results were then compared, and any discrepancies were discussed and resolved through consensus.
A third author (MOL), who received specific training, also participated in the process under supervision.
Initially, 2231 articles were obtained from the five databases reviewed.
After the identification of duplicate articles, 1114 studies were discarded.
Next, 1072 articles were eliminated by reading the title and abstract.
After a complete and exhaustive reading of the remaining 45 articles, 28 additional articles were discarded.
Thus, 16 studies were selected for analysis of the results (see Figure2).
The characteristics of the 16 included studies, including the research design, subjects, conceptual framework, type of intervention, and measurement tools, are shown in Table2.
Five (31.3%) studies were conducted in the USA, three (18.75%) in Denmark, two (12.5%) in Spain, and one each in Canada, China, Japan, Sweden, Iceland, and Indonesia.
The sample included nine randomized clinical studies (56.3%) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Gregory and Gellis2020; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Among these randomized studies, one was a cluster study (6.25%) (Lund et al.2020) and two were pilot studies (12.5%) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Gregory and Gellis2020).
In addition to these, seven quasi‐experimental studies (43.8%) were also included (Boyko et al.2021; Chow et al.2024; Fleisher et al.2023; Ito and Tadaka2022; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022).
Fourteen interventions were identified from these 16 original studies.
Overall, the 14 interventions included a sample of 1922 participants with a mean age of 58.7 years old.
Of the total participants, 893 identified themselves as the patient's spouse (46.5%), and 502 as the adult child (26.1%).
Furthermore, in 12 of the 14 interventions analyzed, the caregivers were predominantly women (85.7%).
The risk of bias of the studies is presented in Table2(see AppendixBof theSupporting Informationfor more detailed information).
Among the nine randomized clinical studies, two studies showed a low risk of bias (Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023); and the remaining seven were evaluated as having some concerns (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Gregory and Gellis2020; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
These risks of bias are largely due to issues such as lack of participant blinding and incomplete reporting of randomization processes (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Gregory and Gellis2020; Mooney et al.2023; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Handling of missing data varied across studies.
Some managed losses effectively through intention‐to‐treat analyses (Gregory and Gellis2020), while others reported higher attrition rates due to patient mortality or caregiver dropout, which increased the risk of bias related to missing outcome data (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Lund et al.2020; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Despite this, most used validated outcome measures and transparent reporting, which reduced the risk of selective reporting bias.
Among the quasi‐experimental studies, with the exception of the study by Fleisher et al. (2023), which had a serious risk of bias, the remaining six showed a moderate risk of bias (Boyko et al.2021; Chow et al.2024; Ito and Tadaka2022; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022).
These risk‐of‐bias results are mainly due to inadequate control of confounding variables and non‐random or voluntary selection of participants, which may have resulted in unrepresentative samples (Boyko et al.2021; Chow et al.2024; Ito and Tadaka2022; Fleisher et al.2023).
In addition, although the classification and application of interventions were generally consistent, in some cases variations may have affected the results (Chow et al.2024).
Another key factor was the treatment of missing data, as high dropout rates or insufficient analysis of incomplete data influenced the interpretation of results (Fleisher et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024).
Finally, the use of self‐reports and lack of blinding increased the risk of bias in outcome measurement (Chow et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022).
Notably, a meta‐analysis of the results could not be performed due to substantial heterogeneity across the included studies.
As outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks et al.2024), narrative synthesis is recommended when variations in populations, interventions, outcomes, or study designs make statistical pooling uninformative or potentially misleading.
This was precisely the case of this review: interventions varied widely in components, duration, intensity, delivery methods, and theoretical underpinnings; outcomes were assessed using diverse instruments at different time points; and the study populations included caregivers of individuals with a range of chronic and progressive conditions, each with distinct trajectories and care needs.
The methodological frameworks that guided the interventions retrieved were mentioned in 10 interventions (71.4%): the Integrated Community End‐of‐Life Care Support Team (ICEST) model (Chow et al.2024); the Pearling Stress Model (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022); the Nezu, Nezu, and D'Zurilla Five‐step model (Gregory and Gellis2020); emotional competence (Ito and Tadaka2022); Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT) underpinned by a person‐centred framework (Lund et al.2020; Norinder et al.2024); the Calgary Family Assessment (CFAM) and Calgary Family Intervention (CFIM) models (Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019); the Coaching model for heart failure home care (Piamjariyakul et al.2024); the Andershed & Ternestedt model (Rochmawati and Saun2022) and the Existential–Phenomenological Therapy (EPT) (von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Fourteen interventions were identified from the 16 primary studies.
Seven were exclusively face‐to‐face interventions (Chow et al.2024; Gregory and Gellis2020; Lund et al.2020; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023); two were online (14.3%) (Boyko et al.2021; Ito and Tadaka2022); one was delivered via telephone (7.1%) (Piamjariyakul et al.2024); and one used an electronic device (7.1%) (Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023).
The remaining three (21.4%) employed a combined modality: Dionne‐Odom et al. (2022) integrated telephone‐delivered coaching, follow‐up calls, and written materials; Mooney et al. (2023) combined online symptom self‐reporting with daily automated interactive voice response telephone coaching tailored to symptom severity; and Fleisher et al. (2023) incorporated home visits with written resources, mentoring calls from other caregivers, and telehealth (Fleisher et al.2023) (See Table3for further details).
6 weekly sessions (one per week), each lasting 20–60 min (average: 32 min).
Followed by monthly check‐in calls through Week 24.
Home visits: 4 total (Months 1, 4, 8, and 12; timing not specified).
Peer mentoring 1 phone call per week for 16 weeks (between visits 2 and 3).
From hospice admission until patient death; mean duration was 37 days, median 18 days.
Psychologists: delivered the dyadic psychological intervention based on existential‐phenomenological therapy, conducted needs assessments, and provided therapeutic support.
SPC team members, (district nurses, and, when possible, the general practitioner): participated in the initial home‐care conference to coordinate care.
The durations of the interventions included ranged from 1 week (Ito and Tadaka2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023) to twelve months (Fleisher et al.2023).
Nine interventions lasted less than three months (50%) (Boyko et al.2021; Chow et al.2024; Gregory and Gellis2020; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022), while two interventions lasted six months (28.6%) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
The number of sessions between patients/caregivers and providers ranged from two (Chow et al.2024; Lund et al.2020; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019) to seven sessions (Ito and Tadaka2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023) and between 5 (Piamjariyakul et al.2024) and more than 15 telephone calls (Fleisher et al.2023; Mooney et al.2023).
The duration of the interventions ranged from 20 min (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022) to 120 min (Rochmawati and Saun2022) (See Table3for further details).
Two interventions (14.3%) were led by palliative care nurses (Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019); one (7.1%) by postgraduate nurses (Rochmawati and Saun2022); one (7.1%) by specially trained lay people (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022); one (7.1%) by psychologists (von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023); one (7.1%) by social workers (Gregory and Gellis2020); and three (21.4%) by a multidisciplinary team.
One of these teams consisted of a nurse, a social worker, a physician, and peer mentors (Fleisher et al.2023); another consisted of nurses, physicians, social workers, psychologists, physiotherapists, and priests (Lund et al.2020); and the other team included nurses, physicians, social workers, home care assistants, and volunteers (Chow et al.2024).
On the other hand, three interventions (21.4%) were self‐administered by the participants, although they were designed by the research team (Ito and Tadaka2022; Mooney et al.2023; Boyko et al.2021), with one of them making use of artificial intelligence (Mooney et al.2023).
Additionally, in one of the interventions (7.1%), participants self‐administered the intervention and selected the music themselves (Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023).
In the studies by Lund et al. (2020) and Piamjariyakul et al. (2024), the participants collaborated in adapting predesigned interventions according to their needs (See Table3for further details).
Eleven interventions (78.6%) focused solely on primary caregivers (Boyko et al.2021; Chow et al.2024; Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Gregory and Gellis2020; Ito and Tadaka2022; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023).
In comparison, three interventions (21.4%) included a dyad of patient and family member (Fleisher et al.2023; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023) (see Table3for further details).
The pathologies of ill family members were cancer in seven interventions (50%) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Ito and Tadaka2022; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023); Parkinson's disease in another (7.1%) (Fleisher et al.2023); heterogeneous illnesses (oncology and other pathologies such as central nervous system disorders, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were reported in three interventions (21.4%) (Gregory and Gellis2020; Norinder et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022); and patients receiving palliative home care for a variety of situations were found in another two interventions (14.3%) (Boyko et al.2021; Chow et al.2024).
After the interventions were integrated and analyzed, three recurrent domains were identified: psychoeducational, practical, and behavioral support.
Psychoeducational support domain.
This domain focuses on providing information and training that enhance caregivers' understanding and skills related to managing stress, emotional coping, and the burden of care.
For instance, Boyko et al. (2021) implemented an online program aimed at improving non‐professional caregivers' competencies in various aspects of care, ranging from physical to emotional and spiritual support.
Similarly, Gregory and Gellis (2020) utilized psychoeducational interventions to reduce caregivers' anxiety and depression through problem‐solving therapies, while Mooney et al. (2023) provided remote educational coaching to improve caregivers' capacity to handle both emotional and practical responsibilities in home care settings.
In total, 11 interventions (78.6%) included this domain, reflecting a common trend towards enhancing caregivers' cognitive and emotional skills, equipping them with essential knowledge to face the challenges of care (Boyko et al.2021; Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Fleisher et al.2023; Gregory and Gellis2020; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Practical support domain.
This domain focuses on providing caregivers with tangible tools and strategies to effectively manage the physical and logistical demands of home care.
This domain is clearly visible in studies such as Chow et al. (2024), Lund et al. (2020) and Norinder et al. (2024), where interventions provided support in care planning and organizing the home environment to improve caregivers' quality of life.
In other cases, providers offered referrals to community services available at the territorial and state level or the possibility of loaning medical equipment (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Fleisher et al.2023).
In the end, five of the interventions reviewed (35.7%) included this domain, underscoring its importance in managing the many tasks involved in the ongoing care of their family member with advanced illness (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Chow et al.2024; Lund et al.2020; Norinder et al.2024; Piamjariyakul et al.2024).
Behavioral Support Domain.
This domain was addressed in three of the interventions examined (21.4%) (Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Ito and Tadaka2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023).
These activities were intended to provide caregivers with strategies to improve their attitudes, behaviors, and emotions related to their caregiving experience.
Most of the interventions focused on improving caregivers' coping skills through individual reflective activities and the use of daily diaries (Ito and Tadaka2022) or through activities involving taking time out of their day to listen to music chosen personally by them (Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023).
Due to the heterogeneity of the outcome measures used in the studies reviewed, it was not possible to determine which intervention was the most effective in addressing the needs of the caregivers under study.
However, some statistically significant results of the interventions were identified.
Table4includes a graphical summary of the effectiveness of the interventions in each study.
Note:White, not measured; Green, statistical superiority favoring intervention; Yellow, statistical superiority favoring intervention only at some measurement time; Red, no statistical superiority favoring intervention.
The following is a summary of the six outcomes most frequently measured in the reviewed studies: depression, anxiety, distress, quality of life, caregiving burden, and self‐efficacy/competence to care.
All the studies evaluated the interventions at multiple time points, and the follow‐up period ranged from 1 week (Ito and Tadaka2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023) to 24 months (Fleisher et al.2023), with a follow‐up of four to eight weeks being the most common (Gregory and Gellis2020; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022).
Depression.
Depression was measured in six of the 14 included interventions.
Of these, only two (22.3%) reported positive effects of the interventions (Chow et al.2024; Gregory and Gellis2020).
In the case of the intervention developed by Piamjariyakul et al. (2024), the intervention demonstrated effectiveness on depression at 3 months (t= 2.67,p= 0.007) but was not sustained at 6 months (t= 1.64,p= 0.06).
For the remaining interventions, there were no statistically significant changes in depression during all their study periods (Fleisher et al.2023; Ito and Tadaka2022; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019).
On the other hand, anxiety was measured in four of the included interventions (28.6%) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Fleisher et al.2023; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Piamjariyakul et al.2024).
However, positive effects of the interventions on this parameter were found in only one of these interventions, although they were not statistically significant [−1.94 (95% CI: −0.98 to 0.11);d= −0.44] (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022).
Fleisher et al. (2023) showed a slight momentary improvement between home visits 1 and 4 that was statistically significant [7.07 (4.1) to 5.96 (3.95);p= 0.049]; and Piamjariyakul et al. (2024) showed a significant effect at 3 months [t= 2.67,p= 0.007], although it was not sustained over time (at 6 monthst= 1.64,p= 0.06).
Finally, distress was measured in two of the interventions included in this study (14.3%) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Lund et al.2020).
In the study by Lund et al. (2020), a positive effect on distress was found at the first assessment (2 weeks after the start of the intervention) (d= 0.12;p= 0.0178), but this effect was not sustained over time (d= 0.04;p= 0.4424).
In comparison, the study by Dionne‐Odom et al. (2022) reported a positive effect of the intervention at subsequent follow‐up regarding this parameter, despite the fact that it did not reach statistical significance [−2.29 (−0.88 a 0.24);d= −0.32].
The instrument most commonly used to measure depression, anxiety, and distress was the 14‐item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Fleisher et al.2023) (see Table2for the remaining instruments used).
Quality of life.
Quality of life was assessed in six interventions (42.9%), with four demonstrating positive effects on this outcome (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022; Gregory and Gellis2020; Ito and Tadaka2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023).
However, the effect reported by Dionne‐Odom et al. (2022) was not statistically significant [−1.56 (95% CI: −6.23 to 3.12);d= −0.07].
In both studies that did not report positive effects, the CSNAT‐I intervention was used: Lund et al. (2020) found no significant effect on quality of life as measured by the EORTC QLQ‐C30 (at 2 weeks:d= 0.03,p= 0.9274; at 4 weeks:d= 0.11,p= 0.7534), and Norinder et al. (2024) also found no statistically significant changes in the QOLLTI‐F at either time point [Mdn = 6.0 (5.0–8.0) to 6.0 (5.0–8.0),p= 0.645].
The most used measurement instrument for this outcome was the Caregiver Quality of Life Index–Cancer (CQOLC) (see Table2).
Caregiver burden.
Ten interventions addressed caregiver burden (71.4%) (Chow et al.2024; Fleisher et al.2023; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Of these, five interventions yielded positive results according to this outcome (Chow et al.2024; Mooney et al.2023; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023).
The study conducted by Piamjariyakul et al. (2024) showed a significant effect at three months (t= 2.06,p= 0.025), although at 6 months follow‐up it was no longer significant (t= 0.97,p= 0.17); similar to what occurred in the study of Lund et al. (2020) (T1:d= 0.15;p= 0.1875; T2:d= 0.19;p= 0.1533).
On the other hand, Fleisher et al. (2023) highlighted that although caregiver burden did not decrease after the intervention, the intervention group maintained a constant burden throughout the study, in contrast to the increase in caregiver burden in the control group.
Numerous measurement instruments were used in the studies (see Table2); only the Zarit Burden Index scale was used at least twice (Rochmawati and Saun2022; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2023).
Self‐efficacy and competency to care.
Although self‐efficacy and perceived competence are often considered differently, the reviewed studies used both concepts interchangeably to refer to the perception of one's ability to cope with stressful situations related to caregiving roles.
Therefore, in the results of this review, the two concepts are considered the same.
Four studies (28.6%) (Boyko et al.2021; Fleisher et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022) measured self‐efficacy/competence in providing care.
However, only three reported a statistically significant improvement in this outcome (Boyko et al.2021; Norinder et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022), especially in terms of educational support and perceived readiness to care for loved ones.
Numerous measurement instruments were used in the present study (see Table2), including the Caregiver Self‐Efficacy Scale (CSES) (Fleisher et al.2023) and the Caregiving Inventory (CGI) (Rochmawati and Saun2022).
The main objective of this review was to identify the impact of home interventions on family members serving as caregivers of people with advanced illness.
The secondary objective was to analyze the characteristics and components of these interventions.
This discussion will focus on the most relevant and novel aspects from the results to guide the design and implementation of future interventions that address caregivers' needs.
It has been reported in various studies that distress and depression are recurrent issues among caregivers (Holm et al.2020; Kozlov et al.2019).
The interventions included in this review focused on caregivers' psychological needs, though the underlying causes of depression and distress are not individually addressed, increasing the likelihood of relapse.
This may explain why a positive effect on this domain has not been observed in several interventions (Fleisher et al.2023; Ito and Tadaka2022; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; von Heymann‐Horan et al.2019).
Similarly, it should be noted that the new caregiving role acquired by these family members directly impacts their quality of life (Alam et al.2020).
The interventions analyzed address this domain from different perspectives: self‐care Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al. (2023; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, et al.2023), help‐seeking, organization, and future planning (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022); emotional support via journals (Ito and Tadaka2022); problem‐solving therapy (Gregory and Gellis2020); and tools identifying needs for health care professionals to address (Lund et al.2020; Norinder et al.2024).
The diversity of approaches and results highlights the complexity of the concept of quality of life, which varies within and across disciplines (Haraldstad et al.2019).
According to Teoli and Bhardwaj (2023), quality of life encompasses health (physical, mental and spiritual), social relations, education level, work environment, social status, wealth, sense of security and safety, freedom, autonomy in decision‐making, and physical environment.
The World Health Organization (WHO) (2024) adds that an individual's perception of quality of life is influenced by the individual's goals, culture, expectations, norms, and concerns; meaning that static interventions are insufficient—interventions must consider each individual's uniqueness.
Caregiver burden and caregiving self‐efficacy/competence must be addressed in a personalized manner.
Caregivers are diverse, so research should clarify similarities and differences to tailor supportive policies and programs (Utz and Warner2022).
The meanings, roles, and dynamics of relationships differ; for example, spouses may be motivated by the romantic vow “in sickness and in health”, while child caregivers may be motivated by a sense of reciprocal duty or filial obligation (Berg et al.2021).
Children often feel less prepared, with caregiving interfering with their life milestones, such as education, forming intimate relationships, creating and raising a family, and achieving financial stability (Too et al.2023; Waters et al.2021).
Similarly, the terms “self‐efficacy” and “competence” in caring should not be used interchangeably.
Khan et al. (2021) define self‐efficacy as confidence in managing caregiving stressors, learning medical skills, controlling disruptive thoughts, accessing community support, assisting with activities of daily living, and maintaining a good relationship with his/her social environment.
On the other hand, competence refers not only to the caregiver's feeling of being able to manage the provision of care (Vernooij‐Dassen et al.1997) but also to the results of care obtained for the patient (Stansfeld et al.2019).
Therefore, researchers must consider these differences when designing interventions for caregivers.
As Utz and Warner (2022) noted in their study, the most effective interventions are those that consider family caregivers' diverse experiences and circumstances, regardless of their age or relationship with the person they care for.
This assertion is consistent with those in other studies, such as Martín‐Martín et al. (2022) and Vermorgen et al. (2021), in which caregivers were considered recipients of care because their well‐being was considered not only during the loved one's illness but also after the death of the loved one.
Therefore, perhaps one of the determining aspects of the success of these interventions would be the family's involvement in the design of the interventions intended to care for them.
However, the need to adopt a family perspective should be emphasized.
The whole family suffers irremediably from the situation that their loved one is experiencing, but at the same time, they try to care for and support the loved one.
The disease significantly impacts all family members, and in one way or another, they modify their roles in the family unit (Lee and Yun2018; Martín‐Martín et al.2022).
For all these reasons, the whole family faces a challenge and a crisis that tests its stability.
Although some studies included in this review attempted to adapt their interventions to the individual needs arising from caregiving, they continued to include exclusively the primary caregiver; and, moreover, the exchange of ideas was embedded within already predesigned interventions (Lund et al.2020).
These may be some of the reasons why no positive effects of these interventions were found.
Regarding the providers of the interventions included in this review, it was observed that in only three of the interventions analyzed (21.4%) a multidisciplinary team was in charge of administering the intervention (Chow et al.2024; Fleisher et al.2023; Lund et al.2020).
Although a minority of studies included this type of team, a study by Fernando and Hughes (2019) stated that a multidisciplinary team is best suited to provide end‐of‐life care.
Nevertheless, the present systematic review has shown that multidisciplinary teams have disparate effects on the intervened domains, while interventions led by a single profession have generally obtained the most significant benefit on the measured variables: specially trained lay guides (Dionne‐Odom et al.2022), social workers (Gregory and Gellis2020), nurses (Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Rochmawati and Saun2022).
Therefore, further studies from a multidisciplinary perspective are necessary to determine the potential benefits of this approach.
Notably, the most common type of provider offering home care to these caregivers is nursing professionals.
Their presence, either exclusively or in conjunction with other professionals, was a feature of eight interventions (57.1%) (Chow et al.2024; Fleisher et al.2023; Lund et al.2020; Mooney et al.2023; Norinder et al.2024; Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019; Piamjariyakul et al.2024; Rochmawati and Saun2022).
Interventions led or co‐led by nurses generally reported significant improvements in caregiver burden (e.g., Rochmawati and Saun2022; Piamjariyakul et al.2024), perceived support (Petursdottir and Svavarsdottir2019), and preparedness for caregiving (Norinder et al.2024).
In contrast, interventions without nurse involvement—such as those based on digital tools or psychosocial support programs delivered by other professionals (e.g., Boyko et al.2021; Gregory and Gellis2020; Valero‐Cantero, Casals, Espinar‐Toledo, Barón‐López, et al.2023,2023)—also showed benefits but tended to focus more on emotional aspects such as distress or quality of life, with mixed or modest effects on caregiving competence or burden.
These findings highlight the particular value of nurse‐led or nurse‐supported interventions in addressing both emotional and practical caregiving challenges.
As Martín‐Martín et al. (2016) emphasized, the essence of nursing lies in the relational and holistic approach to the care of the person and their family.
This orientation positions nurses in a privileged role to respond directly and comprehensively to caregivers' needs, while the involvement of other professionals can provide complementary expertise for specific demands (Martín‐Martín et al.2022).
Despite the insights gained from this review, certain limitations must be acknowledged.
The primary limitation is the heterogeneity of the included studies, which made direct comparisons between interventions difficult and hindered the determination of the most effective intervention.
Differences in the types of interventions, the contexts in which they were applied, their duration, the outcomes assessed, and the instruments used to measure these outcomes made it impossible to conduct a meta‐analysis.
For this reason, the results are predominantly presented in a narrative format, limiting the ability to draw generalizable conclusions about the effectiveness of the interventions.
Moreover, the observed effects of the interventions could be strongly influenced by the cultural context of the countries in which the studies were conducted.
Factors such as cultural differences, the educational level of the participants, and the role and significance of family in each region may have affected the outcomes and their generalizability.
This cultural variability poses challenges regarding the applicability of the interventions to other contexts or populations.
In addition, although gender distribution was reported in several studies, none of them explored differential outcomes by gender, which limits understanding of how caregiving burdens and intervention effects may vary across genders.
This represents a gap in the evidence that future studies should address by incorporating gender‐sensitive analyses.
Another notable limitation is the lack of data regarding the long‐term impact of the interventions.
Most of the included studies evaluated outcomes over relatively short follow‐up periods (ranging 1–24 weeks), with only one study (Fleisher et al.2023) extending follow‐up to approximately 1 year.
As a result, the sustainability of intervention benefits over time remains uncertain.
This represents a significant gap in the literature, particularly given that caregivers' needs and experiences evolve throughout the illness trajectory, including bereavement and long‐term adjustment periods.
Without evidence on the persistence of intervention benefits, it is difficult to determine their overall value in supporting caregivers across the continuum of care.
Future research should therefore prioritize the inclusion of long‐term follow‐up assessments to capture the enduring effects (or lack thereof) of support interventions.
Longitudinal studies could shed light on how caregivers' psychological, emotional, and practical needs change over time, and how interventions might need to be adapted or sustained to meet these evolving demands.
Finally, the lack of long‐term outcome data should be acknowledged as a limitation when interpreting the short‐term results presented in this review.
Furthermore, several methodological limitations of the included studies must be acknowledged.
In particular, shortcomings related to randomization procedures and blinding may have introduced bias and reduced the reliability of the findings.
Most studies also presented a moderate risk of attrition bias, a common challenge in research involving caregivers of patients with advanced chronic illnesses and unpredictable disease trajectories (Cormican et al.2022).
Although we have transparently reported the risk of bias for each study, these limitations inherent to the primary research constrain the overall strength and validity of the conclusions.
Future trials should adopt more rigorous designs, incorporating robust randomization, appropriate blinding, and strategies to minimize attrition.
Finally, although not the primary focus of this review, contextual and structural barriers such as financial constraints, digital literacy, and access to professional care were rarely reported in the studies reviewed.
These external factors may significantly influence the feasibility, accessibility, and scalability of caregiver interventions, and should be systematically investigated in future research.
This systematic review was conducted to analyze existing interventions to assist caregivers in caring for loved ones with advanced illness at home.
A range of interventions—delivered by different professionals and targeting either caregivers alone or caregiver‐patient dyads—were identified in response to the diverse and complex needs reported by caregivers.
Notably, nurses were involved in most of the interventions analyzed, which may reflect their alignment with the holistic and family‐centered philosophy that characterizes nursing practice and their potential role in supporting home‐based caregiving.
However, the overall strength of the evidence is limited.
Most studies included in the review showed moderate to high risk of bias, and substantial heterogeneity in intervention formats, durations, and outcome measures hampers direct comparisons and definitive conclusions.
Although some interventions demonstrated short‐term benefits, the durability and broader applicability of these effects remain unclear.
Future research should therefore prioritize the development and rigorous evaluation of these interventions in diverse healthcare and cultural settings.
In the meantime, and while acknowledging the current limitations in the evidence base, efforts to improve support for caregivers may help enhance their experience and, potentially, contribute to enabling individuals with advanced chronic illness to remain at home during the later stages of illness.
This review highlights the need to prioritize caregivers as essential participants in the care of people with advanced chronic illness at home.
Although nurses were the most frequent providers in the interventions analyzed—reflecting their prominent role in caregiving contexts—the available evidence does not yet allow firm conclusions about which professional profiles or team structures are most effective.
In particular, the potential benefits of multidisciplinary teams, though less commonly implemented, warrant further exploration.
