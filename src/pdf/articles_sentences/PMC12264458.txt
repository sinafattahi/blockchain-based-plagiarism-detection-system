Theph1bmutant, a large deletion (∼60 Mb) involvingPh1(pairing homoeologous 1) on chromosome 5B, was incorporated into five major classes of US wheats, including soft white winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard white spring wheat, and durum wheat, and an Australian wheat variety with universal susceptibility to rusts.
Eightph1bmutant lines in the five classes of US wheats and the Australia wheat were developed using a molecular marker‐assisted backcross breeding pipeline.
All backgrounds containing theph1bmutation induced meiotic homoeologous pairing and recombination as the originalph1bmutant developed in the Chinese landrace “Chinese Spring” (CS).
Thus, they can be utilized for homoeologous recombination‐based alien introgression in the adapted US wheat backgrounds, which will circumvent the use of CSph1bmutant with undesired agronomic characteristics.
Deployment of theph1bmutant in the universal rust susceptible wheat “Line E” will facilitate rust resistance gene identification and transfer from wild species to wheat.
In addition, we developed special DNA markers with a codominance‐like nature specifically for theph1bdeletion and the genomic region spanning the wild‐type allelePh1, which will improve the utility of theph1bmutant in alien introgression.
This work enables direct gene flow from related grass species into adapted wheats to enrich and diversify their genomes and enhances the genetic potential of wheat in production.

Cultivated wheat, including durum wheat (Triticum turgidumL.
subsp.Durum(Desf.)
Husn, 2n= 4x= 28, AABB) and common wheat (Triticum aestivumL., 2n= 6x= 42, AABBDD), are both allopolyploids originated from interspecific crosses of three diploid ancestors and one tetraploid ancestor and subsequent polyploidization (Dvorák et al.,1993; Huang et al.,2002; Kihara,1944; Levy & Feldman,2022; Riley et al.,1958).
Their sub‐genomes A, B, and D are homoeologous to each other (Kihara,1919; Sears,1952).
Both allopolyploids exhibit a diploid‐like chromosome behavior in meiosis because they have a diploidization system in their genomes, which is regulated primarily by thePh1(pairing homoeologous) gene on chromosome 5B (Sears,1976,1977).
The diploidization system ensures meiotic synapsis and recombination to occur between homologous chromosomes, not between homoeologous chromosomes in both durum and common wheat.
It makes both allopolyploids behave like a diploid in meiosis.
Deactivation of the diploidization system by deletingPh1or suppressingPh1activity promotes homoeologous chromosomes to synapse and recombine with each other during meiosis (Chen et al.,1994; Dvorak et al.,2006; Giorgi,1978; Sears,1977).
This has dramatically enhanced meiotic homoeologous recombination‐based alien introgression in wheat and its relatives (Qi et al.,2007; Zhang et al.,2017).
A large deletion mutant ofPh1, designatedph1b, was developed by X‐ray irradiation in Chinese Spring (CS) wheat (K. S. Gill et al.,1993; Gyawali et al.,2019; Sears,1977).
CS is a Chinese soft red spring wheat landrace with many undesired agronomic characteristics.
But CS has been considered a standard common wheat genotype and has been widely utilized in various genomic and genetic studies.
A variety of genetic stocks and numerous genomic resources have been generated in CS wheat.
However, the utility of CS wheat genetic stocks in wheat breeding, includingph1bmutant, has been limited due to its unfavorable agronomic performance.
The CS wheatph1bmutant (CSphm) was transferred to a European winter wheat line (Türkösi et al.,2022) and a US hard red winter wheat line (Friebe et al.,2012), but not other classes of US wheats.
APh1‐specific sequence‐tagged site (STS) marker was used for the detection of homozygousph1bdeletion but was unable to differentiate the hemizygotePh1ph1bfrom the homozygotePh1Ph1in the introgression process (Wang et al.,2002).
Recently, Gyawali et al. (2019) identified the deletion breakpoints of CSphm and developed STS markers specific for the wild‐type allelePh1andph1bdeletion.
Those STS markers can differentiate all three genotypes (Ph1Ph1,Ph1ph1b, andph1bph1b) from each other, which has enhanced the utility of CSphm in alien introgression (Boehm & Cai,2024).
Meanwhile, those allele‐specific markers are useful in the introgression ofph1bmutant from CS into adapted wheat backgrounds, which will further improve the efficacy and throughput of theph1bmutant in alien introgression and wheat breeding (Boehm & Cai,2024; Gyawali et al.,2019).
Here, we report marker‐assisted introgression of CSphm into major classes of US wheats and development ofph1bmutant in adapted US wheats.
This will enable gene flow from wheat relatives directly into modern US wheats for germplasm and variety development in wheat breeding.
Common wheat CS, CSphm, and representative varieties of the five classes of US wheats, including common wheat “Otto” (soft white winter wheat; adapted to the low rainfall), “Jasper” (soft white winter wheat; adapted to intermediate to high rainfall), “SS8641” (soft red winter wheat), “Pembroke 2014” (soft red winter wheat), “Alsen” (hard red spring wheat), “Argent” (hard white spring wheat), durum wheat “Divide,” and “Line E” (an Australian wheat variety with universal susceptibility to rusts) were employed in this study.
Common wheat CS was used asPh1Ph1control, and CSphm (ph1bph1b) was used asph1bdonor andph1bph1bcontrol.
Otto, Jasper, SS8641, Pembroke 2014, Alsen, Argent, Divide, and Line E were used as the recipients ofph1bintrogression.
CSphm was provided by the Wheat Genetics Resource Center at Kansas State University, USA.
All materials were grown in the greenhouse forph1bintrogression crosses and backcrosses.
The US wheat varieties (Otto, Jasper, SS8641, Pembroke 2014, Alsen, Argent, and Divide) and Australian wheat Line E were used as female parent to cross with CSphm, and the resultant F1’s was backcrossed to the respective US wheat parents or Line E. Successive backcrosses were made following a molecular marker‐assisted backcrossing breeding scheme.
A total of three backcrosses were made to recover the genetic backgrounds of the recurrent wheat varieties.
The F1individuals verified as hemizygous (i.e.,Ph1ph1b) by thePh1/ph1b‐specific markers were crossed to the respective US wheat parents for BC1F1production.
Ten to fifteen progenies in each backcross generation were genotyped to select the individuals hemizygous forPh1/ph1bby thePh1/ph1b‐specific markers.
About four to eight hemizygous plants (Ph1ph1b) were advanced for subsequent backcrosses with each of the US wheat parents.
To recover homozygousph1bmutant, four to eight BC3F1individuals hemizygous forPh1/ph1bwere selected and self‐pollinated to produce BC3F2segregating populations with ∼25% homozygousph1bmutant (ph1bph1b).
A total of 30–40 BC3F2individuals were genotyped by thePh1/ph1b‐specific markers to select the plants homozygous forph1bfor seed increase.
Theph1bmutant was incorporated into US wheats and an Australian wheat with universal susceptibility to rusts.
Theph1bmutant induced meiotic homoeologous pairing and recombination in all wheat genotypes examined.
The US wheatph1bmutants will enable gene flow directly from related grasses into US wheats.
The DNA markers specific forph1bandPh1will improve the utility of theph1bmutant in alien introgression.
Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves either freshly collected or stored in a −80°C freezer as described by Niu et al. (2011). ThePh1allele‐specific STS marker (Xwgc2049) together withph1b‐specific STS markers (Xwgc2106) were used to differentiatePh1Ph1,Ph1ph1b, andph1bph1bgenotypes from each other in a dual‐plex PCR (Gyawali et al.,2019).
The PCR program includes initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C annealing temperature for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min 30 s and final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
PCR was conducted in a 20‐µL reaction mixture containing 100 ng template DNA, 1 µL of 10 µM each primer, and 10 µL of 2× GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega).
PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with either ethidium bromide or bio‐safe Coomassie stain G‐250 (Bio‐Rad) staining.
Genomic DNA was isolated from leaves of 2‐week‐old seedlings using a Wizard Magnetic 96 DNA Plant System (Promega) following vendor's protocol modified for wheat.
PCR was run in 8 µL of PCR allelic competitive extension (PACE) mixture containing 40–120 ng of DNA, 0.11 µL of 72× primer mix, and 4 µL of a 2× PACE Genotyping Master mix (3CR Bioscience Ltd).
Four‐primer PACE assay involvingPh1‐specific (chromosome 5BL‐specific) andph1bmutant‐specific primer pairs (Table1) were used to differentiate the genotypes ofPh1Ph1,Ph1ph1b, andph1bph1bfrom each other.
Four‐primer PCR allelic competitive extension (PACE) assay discriminatingPh1allele andph1bdeletion on chromosome 5BL.
Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The 100 µL of 72× primer mix was prepared by mixing 100 µM primer stocks: 12 µL of each forward primer and 30 µL of each reverse primer in 0.1 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.6).
PACE PCR was performed in a BioRad T100 thermal cycler under the following conditions: initial denaturation 15 min at 94°C, then 10 cycles of 94°C − 20 s, 62–56°C − 1 min with a temperature drop of 0.6°C per cycle, then 35 cycles of 94°C − 20 s, 56°C − 1 min and held at 10°C.
The PCR results were read using a Bio‐Rad CFX96 machine and the Maestro 2.3 software (Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Inc.) after reading cycle: 37°C for 1 min.
The STS markersXwgc2049andXwgc2111(Gyawali et al.,2019) were used to validate PACE genotyping results.
Meiotic chromosomes were prepared from anthers at metaphase I (MI) of theph1bintrogression lines and their recipient parents as described by Cai et al. (1996). Chromosomes were stained with DAPI (4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole) and visualized under a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscopy system with ZEN 3.3 imaging software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).
Meiotic chromosome pairing configurations and frequencies were analyzed in 10–94 meiocytes from three to five plants of the recipient wheat cultivars and theirph1bmutants.
The common wheat CS, Otto, Jasper, SS8641, Pembroke 2014, Alsen, Argent, and Line E, and durum wheat Divide harborPh1on chromosome 5B, while CSph1bmutant has the genomic region of ∼60 Mb spanningPh1locus deleted (Gyawali et al.,2019).
To transfer theph1bdeletion from CSphm to Otto, Jasper, SS8641, Pembroke 2014, Alsen, Argent, Divide and Line E, CSphm was used as male parent to pollinate each of the recipient parents.
The F1hybrids were backcrossed to the respective recipient parent, and the resultant BC1F1individuals were genotyped by thePh1/ph1b‐specific STS markers (Xwgc2049andXwgc2106) to select the hemizygous segregants containingph1bdeletion (i.e.Ph1ph1b) for the second backcross.
Two additional backcrosses were made to the hemizygous BC1F1individuals (Ph1ph1b) to further recover the genetic backgrounds of the recipient wheat parents and to retain theph1bdeletion through the marker‐assisted introgression pipeline (Figure1).
Diagram of marker‐assisted introgression of theph1bmutant from Chinese Spring (CS) into US and Australian wheats.
The STS markerXwgc2049amplified a segment of 846 bp within the genomic region spanning thePh1locus on chromosome 5BL, which is absent in theph1bmutant.
Thus,Xwgc2049specifically tags the wild‐typePh1allele.
The STS markerXwgc2106amplified a segment of 1149 bp across the deletion joint point in theph1bmutant, which is not amplifiable for the wild‐typePh1allele because two primer annealing sites within thePh1genomic region (>60 Mb apart) are far beyond the amplification range of a regular PCR (Gyawali et al.,2019).Xwgc2106, therefore, is aph1bmutant‐specific marker.
Our dual‐plex PCR withXwgc2049andXwgc2106clearly differentiatedPh1Ph1fromPh1ph1bin the BC1F1, BC2F1, and BC3F1progenies (Figure2) andPh1Ph1,Ph1ph1b, andPh1ph1bfrom each other in the BC3F2populations (Figure3).
In addition, we did not observe polymorphisms among the genotypes of the introgressions at theXwgc2049andXwgc2106loci (Figures2and3).

Three backcrosses were made for each of the introgressions.
We found that the wild‐type allelePh1and theph1bdeletion had a similar transmission rate in each of the introgression backcrosses and their self‐pollinated populations.
Preference transmission was not observed for either of these two alleles in the backcross and self‐pollination generations.
Eightph1bmutant introgression lines were developed in seven modern varieties representing five classes of US wheats (i.e., Alsen, Divide, Argent, SS8641, Otto, Jasper, and Pembroke 2014) and one Australian wheat (Line E).
In addition, we restored the CS genetic background in CSph1bmutant using the same marker‐assisted introgression pipeline (Figure1).
So, a total of nineph1bmutant introgression lines were produced in this study.
Phenotypically, the spring wheatph1bintrogression lines were very similar to their respective recipient parents.
However, the winter wheatph1bintrogressions had some phenotypical differences from their respective recipient parents especially on maturity, heading date, and spike morphology after three backcrosses under the greenhouse environment.
The phenotypic differences between the winterph1bintrogression lines and their recipient parent might result from the background residual of the CS wheat or its interaction with the recipient backgrounds.
The seven US modern wheat varieties (Alsen, Divide, Argent, SS8641, Otto, Jasper, and Pembroke 2014), CS, and the Australian wheat line (Line E) showed regular diploid‐like chromosome pairing/synapsis during meiosis in the presence ofPh1.
Homologous chromosomes in these wheat genotypes containingPh1allele normally synapsed to form a bivalent (Figure4).
Occasionally, some homologous chromosomes failed to synapse and appeared as a univalent, and some chromosomes formed a multivalent due probably to a structural variation in the presence ofPh1(Table2).

ph1bmutant‐induced homoeologous pairing configurations and frequencies in Chinese Spring (CS) and modern wheat varieties.
Note: Number and percentage (in parenthesis) of the meiocytes contain a multivalent and/or univalent.III—trivalent;IV—quadrivalent;V—pentavalent;VI—hexavalent;I—univalent.
Multivalents and univalent were frequently observed in all nineph1bintrogressions involving CS, seven modern US wheat varieties (Alsen, Divide, Argent, SS8641, Otto, Jasper, and Pembroke 2014), and one Australian wheat line (Line E), indicatingph1bmutant‐induced homoeologous pairing/synapsis between chromosomes from different wheat sub‐genomes (i.e. A, B, and D) (Figure4and Table2).
These meiotic chromosome pairing/synapsis results confirmed the incorporation ofph1bdeletion and removal ofPh1in the introgressions.
Additionally, this pairwise cytological analysis indicated thatph1bmutant effectively induced meiotic homoeologous pairing and recombination in those different classes of modern wheats.
All hexaploidph1bintrogressions exhibited a similar homoeologous paring/synapsis pattern in terms of the presence of trivalent (III), quadrivalent (IV), pentavalent (V), hexavalent (VI), and univalent (I).
Variation in the frequencies of individual multivalent and univalent was observed in differentph1bintrogressions.
Overall, the tetraploidph1bintrogression “Divideph1b” showed lower frequencies of multivalents and univalent than the hexaploid introgressions (Table2).
Theph1bmutant has been widely used to induce meiotic homoeologous recombination for alien introgression in wheat, which enriches and diversifies the wheat genome to increase the genetic potential of wheat for improvement.
To improve the utility of theph1bmutant in alien introgression, we developed high‐throughput co‐dominant PACE markers to differentiate thePh1allele from theph1bdeletion based on the DNA sequences within the deletion region and across the deletion joint point.
This marker system will improve the efficacy and throughput of the homoeologous recombination‐based chromosome engineering in alien introgression.
To design an SNP‐based PACE assay for thePh1allele andph1bdeletion, we located the deletion breakpoints on chromosome arm 5BL of CSph1bmutant according to IWGSC RefSeq v2.1 (Zhu et al.,2021) and data reported by Gyawali et al. (2019) and analyzed the sequences immediately flanking the deletion joint point.
The sequences (∼400 bp) adjacent to the distal and proximal breakpoints (DB and PB) of theph1bdeletion were aligned to multiple locations on each wheat chromosome by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against IWGSC RefSeq v2.1 (Alaux et al.,2018; Zhu et al.,2021).
Subsequent BLAST with the longer queries against GIRI and TREP repeat databases (Kohany et al.,2006; Wicker et al.,2002) showed that the 2080‐bp sequence adjacent to DB (distal to 457,812,183 bp on 5BL) was 84.3% similar to the internal portion of Copia‐type LTR retrotransposon Maximus from barley.
The 1700‐bp sequence adjacent to the PB (proximal to 397,791,418 bp on 5BL) was 69.6% similar to the internal portion of a wheat Gypsy‐type LTR retrotransposon from GIRI repeat database and 89% similar to the wheat LTR retrotransposon Abana B of unknown type from TREP database.
Thus, the genomic regions surrounding both deletion breakpoints (DB and PB) contain dispersed repeats and can be highly variable among hexaploid and tetraploid wheat varieties, which complicates the design of an SNP‐based assay universal for diverse wheat genotypes.
In attempt to design a three‐primer PACE assay (two forward primers specific forph1bdeletion andPh1allele respectively and one common reverse primer), we identified 5B‐specific SNPs close to DB and PB of theph1bdeletion by analyzing the 5BL sequences adjacent to the DB and PB of common wheat CS and durum wheat “Svevo,” “Strongfield,” and “Capelli,” and their counterparts on homoeologous group‐5 chromosomes 5A and 5D as well as several other chromosomes (Altschul,1990).
Several primer combinations located on the 480‐bp sequence surrounding DB and PB were designed.
Two primer combinations adjacent to PB discriminatedPh1andph1bin CS by PACE assay, but did not work in the same way onPh1allele detection in some of the nine diverse wheat varieties (Line E, Alsen, Divide, Argent, SS8641, Otto, Jasper, and Pembroke 2014).
To overcome this problem, we developed several four‐primer PACE assays with one primer pair specific forph1bPB and other pair specific for thePh1region that is absent in theph1bdeletion.
We identified B genome‐specific SNPs present in all nine wheat varieties within thePh1genomic region of 394,969,000–394,979,000 bp (IWGSC RefSeq v2.1; Gyawali et al.,2019) corresponding to the wheat cDNA tplb0019i10 (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/wheat/komugi/) on 5BL, which led to the development ofPh1region‐specific primer pairs.
After testing of several four‐primer PACE assays, one of the PACE assays, designatedXwgc2321(Table1), clearly discriminated thePh1allele andph1bdeletion and their resulted genotypesPh1Ph1,Ph1ph1b, andph1bph1bin all nine diverse wheat varieties (Figure5).
The PACE assay results were validated with the STS markersXwgc2049andXwgc2111(Gyawali et al.,2019) in all winter and spring wheat varieties, and consistent results were obtained from the PACE assay and STS marker analysis (FigureS1).

Allele 1 and Allele 2 refer to thePh1‐specific andph1b‐specific alleles, respectively.
Individuals homozygous forph1b(i.e.,ph1bph1b) are represented by blue squares, those homozygous forPh1(i.e.,Ph1Ph1) by orange circles, those hemizygous forPh1(i.e.Ph1ph1b) by green triangles, and negative controls (no DNA template, no call) by black diamonds.
Wheat genome has a narrow genetic variation due to its polyploid origin (Dvorák et al.,1993; Huang et al.,2002; Kihara,1944; Levy and Feldman2022; Riley et al.,1958), which has increasingly become a bottleneck for wheat improvement.
Wheat ancestors and numerous relatives, including wild and cultivated species, harbor tremendous genetic variation.
They represent an invaluable gene reservoir useful in extending the genetic variability of the wheat genome and increasing the genetic potential of wheat in grain production.
Meiotic homoeologous recombination‐based chromosome engineering has been considered a most effective approach of bridging gene flow from the relatives into wheat (Boehm & Cai,2024; B. S. Gill et al.,2011; Qi et al.,2007; Rey et al.,2015).
Theph1bmutant developed in the old wheat landrace CS has been commonly used to induce meiotic homoeologous recombination between wheat and alien chromosomes for gene introgression from the relatives into wheat (Zhang et al.,2017).
But the CS wheatph1bmutant introduces undesired agronomic traits of CS into the introgressions besides inducing homoeologous recombination, which limits the utility of theph1bmutant in alien introgression.
In this study, we deployed theph1bmutant into modern US wheats.
Theph1bmutant was found to induce frequent meiotic homoeologous pairing in all US wheats and Australian wheat Line E as it does in CS, indicating theph1bmutant normally functions to enhance homoeologous recombination for alien introgression in all these wheat genotypes (Figure4and Table2).
The frequencies of multivalents and univalent in allph1bintrogressions were significantly higher than their wild‐type recipients even though we observed variation among the genotypes (Table2).
The lower homoeologous pairing frequency in the tetraploid durum wheat Divideph1bmutant than common wheatph1bmutants probably resulted from the lack of the D sub‐genome in durum wheat comparing to the hexaploid common wheat.
The codominance‐like nature of the multiplex PCR‐based STS and four‐primer PACE markers specific for the wild‐typePh1allele andph1bdeletion allowed for the differentiation of the three genotypes at thePh1locus, includingPh1Ph1,Ph1ph1b, andph1bph1b, in thisph1bintrogression study (Figure5).
This could not be done with regular dominant markers specific for thePh1genomic region (K. S. Gill & Gill,1996; Roberts et al.,1999) before theph1bdeletion breakpoints were demarcated by Gyawali et al. (2019). These special STS and PACE markers were highly diagnostic for both alleles in all wheat genotypes involved in this study (Figures3and5).
They will improve the utility of the US wheatph1bmutants in alien introgression and wheat breeding.
No polymorphism was detected at thePh1‐specific STS locusXwgc2049among the recipient wheat parents included in this study and at theph1bdeletion‐specific STS locusXwgc2106among theph1bintrogression genotypes in this study (Figures2and3).
These findings suggest that the genomic regions at both STS loci might be conservative.
Another possibility of no polymorphism at theph1bdeletion‐specific STS locusXwgc2106among the introgressions would be the incorporation of the entire CS genomic region spanning theph1bdeletion breakpoint into the introgressions.
This might result from the interrupted meiotic recombination between the wild‐typePh1genomic region of the recipient wheat genotypes and CSph1bdeletion, leading to a uniparental transmission of the CSph1bdeletion into the introgressions.
Theph1bdeletion will be eventually eliminated from the end products of alien introgression because it breaks the stability and integrity of the wheat polyploid genome.
That CS genomic region flanking theph1bdeletion will be removed together with the deletion.
So, it would not bring in undesired traits into alien introgressions if that is the case.
Further studies of this genomic region will provide a better understanding of theph1bintrogression.
The US wheatph1bmutants developed in this study will enable direct gene flow from wheat relatives into adapted US wheat backgrounds and increase the efficacy of homoeologous recombination‐based alien introgression in wheat breeding.
The Australian wheat Line E is universally susceptible to all rust races.
So, the Line Eph1bmutant will be an ideal recipient parent for rust resistance gene introgression and identification.
All theseph1bintrogressions will be released and made available to the wheat breeding and genetic research community for alien introgression, genetic and genome studies, and germplasm/variety development.
Thus, this work will enhance gene introgression from wheat‐related grass species and ancestors directly into US wheats and ultimately increase the genetic variability of US wheats to resolve the bottleneck of wheat improvement.
