The treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) aims to alleviate pain and prevent further compression; however, compression often progresses during conservative treatments.
Furthermore, studies on the factors affecting compression rate progression and the timing at which compression progresses the most are limited.
A total of 122 patients with OVCF, who were follow-up duration > 6 months, were included.
Factors, such as age, sex, fracture levels, bone mineral density, body mass index, medications for osteoporosis, initial compression rate, fracture locations, and pelvic incidence were assessed.
The compression rates were measured initially and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months.
The correlation between these factors and compression rate progression of > 50% was analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.
The compression rate progression over time was evaluated using a repeated-measures general linear model, and clinical outcomes were assessed using a pairedt-test.
Univariate analysis showed that an initial compression rate of < 30% was significantly associated with progression (P= 0.001).
Multivariate Cox regression confirmed this association (P= 0.013; hazard ratio, 3.018; 95% confidence interval, 1.265–7.200).
The most significant compression rate progression occurred within the first month of follow-up (P= 0.038).
At the final follow-up, the visual analog scale for back pain (P= 0.009) and Oswestry Disability Index (P= 0.026) were significantly higher in the compression rate progression group.
An initial compression rate of < 30% was highly correlated with compression rate progression, particularly within the first month after injury.
Compression rate progression correlated with clinical outcomes in terms of pain and quality of life.
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are major fractures resulting from osteoporosis, particularly affecting the older population and significantly impacting their quality of life by increasing the risk of disability and mortality.1,2With the aging population, the prevalence of OVCF in older adults continues to increase.
Choi et al.3have reported that the 5-year incidence rate of OVCF in South Korea was 852.24 cases per 100,000 individuals, with 45% of these cases occurring in patients aged ≥ 70 years.
Consequently, as the aging population grows, so does the prevalence of osteoporosis, resulting in an increase in OVCF and subsequently elevating the socioeconomic and healthcare burdens associated with this condition.
Conservative treatment is typically administered to patients with osteoporotic compression fractures.
This treatment involves initial bed rest, followed by brace application, pain management using analgesics, and osteoporosis medication to support bone health.3,4Although conservative management provides satisfactory outcomes in most cases, some patients experience progressive vertebral body compression, neurological complications, or persistent pain that resists conservative care, warranting surgical intervention.5When OVCF occurs, patients often face functional limitations and chronic, severe pain, which can severely impair their quality of life.6,7Furthermore, as vertebral body compression progresses, chronic pain and spinal deformities may develop, with a small number of patients eventually experiencing delayed neurological compression.
Identifying the factors that influence compression progression in OVCF could enable clinicians to evaluate the risk of fracture progression early in the treatment process and, in turn, potentially prevent these complications.
Although previous studies have examined risk factors associated with compression progression of vertebral body in OVCF.7,8,9,10,11,12They generally focused on univariate analyses.
Research analyzing all potential interacting factors using multivariate analysis remains limited.
This study aimed to address this gap by investigating specific factors associated with compression rate progression during conservative treatment of OVCF and identifying critical timeframes when compression rate progression is most likely to occur.
In this study, the term “compression rate progression” is introduced as a newly used term to describe the increase in vertebral compression over time, particularly in patients undergoing conservative treatment for OVCF.
Medical records and radiographic data of 122 patients who presented with thoracolumbar OVCF at our institution between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023 were retrospectively analyzed.
Patients were enrolled in the study if they visited the hospital within 2 weeks of injury.
Initially, 150 patients with thoracolumbar OVCF were identified; however, patients who underwent cement augmentation (17 patients), had multi-level fractures (5 patients), had pathologic fractures due to cancer metastasis (2 patients), or did not complete at least 6 months of follow-up (4 patients) were excluded.
All patients were conservatively treated with thoracolumbosacral bracing, which was worn continuously for 3 months after the injury.
In the first month, analgesic combined with acetaminophen (325 mg) and tramadol (37.5 mg) was administered twice daily.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed for more severe pain.
Most patients were only prescribed pain relievers during the first month.
However, if pain persisted during their second visit, which was 1 month after the first visit, the prescription was extended for another month.
Radiographic follow-up involved lumbar anteroposterior and lateral simple radiographs, and whole-spine standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs obtained at the time of the initial visit, as well as at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months after the injury.
Additional imaging including lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density (BMD) were also performed.
Compression rate progression was defined as an increase of ≥ 50% in the compression rate over the final 6 months compared with the initial measurement.
For example, if the initial compression rate was 20%, any progression resulting in a final compression rate of ≥ 60% (an increase of ≥ 40%, equivalent to 50% of the remaining 80% of the vertebral body height) was classified as significant compression rate progression (Fig. 1).
All radiographic measurements were independently assessed by two spine surgeons.
Interobserver agreements for continuous variables (vertebral height) were verified using the intraclass correlation coefficient.
The compression rate progression was 26.85%, which was equivalent to 50% of the remaining 53.3% at the initial visit.
Potential factors influencing the progression of vertebral compression were assessed including age, sex, fracture level, fracture location within the vertebral body on MRI, BMD, body mass index (BMI), prior osteoporosis medication, initial compression rate, and pelvic incidence.
Patients were categorized as follows.
To dichotomize and analyze the continuous variables of age, initial compression rate, and pelvic incidence, the cutoff value was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the analysis was categorized into those above and below the cutoff value.
Age was categorized as ≥ 80 and < 80 years.
Level of fracture was measured at the thoracolumbar junction (T12 to L1) or other vertebral levels.
Fracture location on MRI was determined according to Kanchiku et al.13Based on this classification, fractures were further categorized based on endplate involvement as follows: anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior.
Total types were classified as having upper and lower endplate involvement (endplate involvement (+) group), whereas the central type was classified as having no endplate involvement (endplate involvement (−) group) (Fig. 2).
It was classified according to whether the upper or lower endplate, or only the middle portion of the vertebral body, was affected.
Two surgeons independently assessed the measurements and interobserver agreement was assessed using kappa statistics.
BMD was categorized using a T-score ≤ −3.0 or > −3.0.
BMI was categorized by an overweight threshold of 25 kg/m2using the World Health Organization standard for overweight (25 kg/m2).
Prior osteoporosis medication was defined as whether taking osteoporosis medication or not.
Initial compression rate was categorized as ≥ 30% and < 30%.
Pelvic incidence was categorized as ≥ 50° and < 50°.
The compression rate was measured at the initial visit and at the 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and final 6-month follow-up, to identify the critical periods for compression progression.
Patients were grouped based on whether they experienced a compression progression of ≥ 50% by the final follow-up, and time-based analyses were conducted to examine the progression trends in both groups.
Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) for lower back pain (LBP) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for functional outcomes measured at the initial visit and at the 6-month follow-up.
Inter-observer agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient for the compression rate at baseline and at the 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and final 6-month follow-up.
Kappa statistics were used to assess fracture location on MRI.
Univariate analysis was conducted for demographic and associated factors, and the patients were grouped based on whether the compression rate progressed.
Chi-square tests were used to assess categorical variables.
A multivariate Cox regression model with stepwise backward elimination was used to identify independent predictors of compression rate progression by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each factor.
ROC curve analysis was performed, and significance was set atP< 0.05.
To analyze the progression over time, changes in the compression ratio at each follow-up interval were evaluated using a repeated-measures general linear model, comparing patients with and without compression rate progression.
Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were assessed using a pairedt-test, with statistical significance set atP< 0.05.
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics®version 28 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hanyang University Guri Hospital (GURI 2024-04-012).
The requirement for informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective nature of this study.
In the radiographic analysis, the interclass correlation coefficients for the compression rate at the initial, 1, 2, 3, and final 6 months were 0.984, 0.971, 0.978, 0.981, and 0.987, respectively, indicating excellent agreement.
Among the 122 patients who were followed up for > 6 months, no cases of nonunion were recorded.
Intervertebral clefts were observed in 19 patients (15.6%); however, no motion was detected in the flexion–extension view.
To determine the threshold for compression rate progression in the ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) of compression rate progression was 0.994 (95% CI, 0.984–0.998;P< 0.001), with a cutoff value of 50%.
Of the 122 patients, 55 (45.1%) exhibited a compression rate progression of ≥ 50% at the 6-month follow-up compared with the initial measurement.
The mean age of patients was 76.1 years (range: 58–92).
In ROC curve analysis, the result showed that the AUC of age was 0.621 (95% CI, 0.517–0.724;P= 0.043) with cutoff value being 80 years old.
Of 68 patients below 80 years old, 29 (42.6%) showed compression rate progression, compared to 26 (48.1%) among 54 patients aged 80 years old or above.
The difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.544).
Of the 122 patients, 35 were men and 87 were women.
Compression progression occurred in 15 (42.9%) men and 40 (46.0%) women, without statistically significant difference (P= 0.754).
For patients with fractures at the thoracolumbar junction (T12–L1), 25 of 60 patients (41.7%) experienced compression rate progression, while among those with fractures at other levels, 30 of 62 patients (48.4%) showed compression rate progression.
No statistically significant association was observed between the two groups (P= 0.456).
Of 39 patients with a T-score < −3.0, 18 (46.2%) experienced compression rate progression, compared to 37 out of 83 patients (44.6%) in the group with a T-score ≥ −3.0 (P= 0.870).
In patients with BMI < 25 kg/m2, 42 out of 94 patients (44.7%) showed compression rate progression, compared to 13 out of 28 patients (46.4%) in those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2(P= 0.870).
Of 122 patients, 9 had been undergoing prior osteoporosis treatment for 1–5 years.
Among them, 4 patients were treated with bisphosphonates, 4 with denosumab, and 1 with a selective estrogen receptor modulator.
Among patients who had been on osteoporosis medication before the injury, 6 of 9 patients (66.7%) showed compression rate progression, whereas among those without prior medication, 49 of 113 patients (43.4%) showed progression (P= 0.176).
The Kappa coefficient for fracture location on MRI between observers was 0.768, indicating good agreement.
According to the classification by Kanchiku et al.,137 patients with the anterior type, 1 patient with the posterior type, 38 patients with the superior type, 8 patients with the inferior type, 51 patients with the total type, and 17 patients with the central type fractures.
Of these, the endplate involvement (+) group comprised 105 patients, whereas the endplate involvement (−) group included 17 patients.
Compression rate progression was observed in 47 of 105 patients (44.8%) patients with the endplate involvement (+) group and in 8 of 17 patients (47.1%) patients with the endplate involvement (−) group.
This difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.860).
The AUC of the initial compression rate was 0.813 (95% CI, 0.735–0.890;P= 0.001), with a cutoff value of 30%.
Among patients with an initial compression rate < 30%, 49 of 91 patients (53.8%) showed compression rate progression, whereas 6 of 31 (19.4%) with an initial compression rate of ≥ 30% showed progression, with a statistically significant difference (P= 0.001).
The AUC of pelvic incidence was 0.611 (95% CI, 0.507–0.715;P= 0.047), and the cutoff value was 50°.
Among patients with a pelvic incidence of < 50°, 33 of 67 patients (49.3%) showed compression rate progression, whereas 22 of 55 patients (40.0%) with a pelvic incidence of ≥ 50° showed compression rate progression without significant association (P= 0.307) (Table 1).
BMD = bone mineral density, BMI = body mass index.
aCompression rate progression means whether the vertebral body compression rate progresses by 50% or more at the final follow-up compared to the vertebral body compression rate on the lateral X-ray at the first visit.
Considering all relevant factors—age, sex, level of fracture, fracture location on MRI, BMD, BMI, prior osteoporosis medication, initial compression rate, and pelvic incidence—multivariable Cox regression survival analysis was conducted for patients with a compression rate progression of ≥ 50%.
Age (P= 0.452), sex (P= 0.887), fracture level (P= 0.904), BMD (P= 0.794), BMI (P= 0.952), prior use of osteoporosis medication (P= 0.310), fracture location on MRI (P= 0.849), and pelvic incidence (P= 0.646) were not significantly associated with disease progression.
However, an initial compression rate of < 30% was significantly associated with compression rate progression (P= 0.013; HR, 3.018; 95% CI, 1.265–7.200).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a mean survival duration of 5.03 months (95% CI, 4.34–5.73) for patients with an initial compression rate of ≥ 30% and 3.29 months (95% CI, 2.77–3.80) for those with < 30%, showing a statistically significant difference (P= 0.001) (Fig. 3,Table 2).
HR = hazard ratio, CI = confidence interval, BMD = bone mineral density, BMI = body mass index.
To determine the critical timeframe for compression rate progression, we measured the compression rate at the initial visit, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and final 6 months after injury and analyzed the results using a repeated measures general linear model.
Mauchly’s test for sphericity was significant (P< 0.001); therefore, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied.
The repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant changes in compression rate over time (F(1.254, 150.427) = 341.160;P= 0.001; partial η2= 0.740).
The average compression rate was 21.68% (95% CI, 19.43–23.93) initially, 35.70% (95% CI, 32.64–38.75) at 1 month, 36.73% (95% CI, 33.58–39.88) at 2 months, 38.15% (95% CI, 34.94–41.36) at 3 months, and 39.64% (95% CI, 36.33–42.94) at the final 6 months after injury, indicating rapid progression within the first month, followed by a gradual increase thereafter.
During the follow-up process, in the group with a final compression progression rate progression of < 50%, compression progressed by an average of 2.69% (95% CI, 2.29–3.09) at each follow-up, and in the group with a final compression rate progression of ≥ 50%, compression progressed by an average of 6.29% (95% CI, 4.96–7.61).
In addition, to determine any significant differences in the compression rate progression between the initial follow-up and at and 1 month, 1 and 2 months, 2 and 3 months, and 3 and 6 months after the final follow-up, a Tukey post hoc test was performed.
The difference in the compression rate progression between the initial follow-up and 1 month after injury was significant (P= 0.038); however, no statistically significant differences in the compression rate progression were observed between 1 and 2 months, 2 and 3 months, and 3 months and the final follow-up time (P= 0.965, 0.955, and 0.726, respectively) (Fig. 4).
The initial compression rate was higher in the group with a compression rate progression < 50% (progression (−) group) (30.49%; 95% CI, 27.47–33.51) than in the group with a compression rate progression of ≥ 50% (progression (+) group) (12.87%; 95% CI, 9.54–16.20) (P= 0.001).
At the 1-month follow-up, the progression (+) group showed a substantially higher increase of 33.87% (95% CI, 29.35–38.40) than the progression (−) group with 37.52% (95% CI, 33.42–41.62;P= 0.028).
No significant differences were observed at the 2-month (P= 0.102), 3-month (P= 0.189), or 6-month follow-up between the two groups (P= 0.338) (Fig. 5,Table 3).
aProgression (−) means a group that has not undergone compression rate progression.
bProgression (+) means a group with compression rate progression.
Clinical outcomes, measured using VAS for LBP and ODI, were recorded at the initial visit and 6 months later.
Initial VAS for LBP averaged 6.67 (95% CI, 6.45–6.89) in the progression (−) group and 6.82 (95% CI, 6.62–7.01) in the progression (+) group, without significant difference (P= 0.357).
However, at the final follow-up, the progression (−) group had a significantly lower VAS score (1.33; 95% CI, 1.06–1.61) than the progression (+) group (1.85; 95% CI, 1.57–2.13) (P= 0.009).
For ODI, the initial values were 62.66% (95% CI, 61.77–63.46) in the progression (−) group and 63.82% (95% CI, 62.88–64.75) in the progression (+) group (P= 0.071).
Final ODI scores were significantly lower in the progression (−) group (19.25%; 95% CI, 18.49–19.97) than in the progression (+) group (20.44%; 95% CI, 19.72–21.15) (P= 0.026) (Table 4).
CI = confidence interval, VAS = visual analogue scale, LBP = low back pain, ODI = Oswestry Disability Index.
aProgression (−) means a group that has not undergone compression rate progression.
bProgression (+) means a group with compression rate progression.
The primary treatment for OVCF is conservative and typically involves brace and pain control.
In clinical practice, these methods provide satisfactory results.1,7However, in some cases, significant pain persists, and radiographic progression of vertebral compression occurs even after adequate conservative treatment for a sufficient period.8,11,14This study was conducted to investigate the risk factors associated with compression rate progression in OVCF and to identify the timeframes during which vertebral body compression is most likely to occur.
Among the factors analyzed, age has been previously explored as a predictor of compression rate progression with mixed results.
Goldstein et al.11have reported a strong association between patient age and final compression rate, as well as kyphotic deformity.4Meanwhile, Zhang et al.12and Yun et al.15noted age as an indicator of fracture and compression rate progression.
Conversely, other studies have determined no significant relationship between age and vertebral compression or deformity.8,16,17Consistent with the latter findings, our study did not identify age as a significant factor in compression rate progression for OVCF.
Sex, another demographic factor, has shown varying effects in OVCF cases.
The incidence rate among women is more than twice that of men, which is consistent with clinical incidence statistics.8,18,19However, previous studies have reported no significant differences in radiographic outcomes or compression rate progression between the sexes.11,12Similarly, our study identified no statistically significant association between sex and compression rate progression, even though the proportion of female patients was approximately 2.5 times that of male patients in our cohort.
The association between compression fractures and the thoracolumbar junction has been widely investigated.
Sohn et al.20found that fractures at the thoracolumbar junction were linked to an increased risk of progressive collapse in patients with OVCF.
Ha and Kim8and Tsujio et al.16have reported on the importance of mid-column fractures in contributing to compression rate progression at the thoracolumbar junction.
Muratore et al.21have also suggested that owing to its unique biomechanical characteristics, fractures at the T–L junction could be more prone to progression.
However, Yun et al.15did not find a direct correlation between level of fracture and compression rate progression.
Similarly, our analysis revealed that although compression fractures were relatively more common at the thoracolumbar junction, the progression of compression was not statistically significant in relation to fracture location.
In terms of fracture location within the vertebral body, Patil and Nene22reported that OVCF involving the thoracolumbar junction and superior endplate were more likely to progress in terms of kyphotic deformity and collapse.
Owing to differences in the internal trabecular structure, compression fractures more frequently involve the superior endplate.23,24Our study determined no statistically significant association between fractures affecting the upper and lower endplates and compression rate progression.
BMD is a predictor of fracture occurrence, prognosis, and recovery in OVCF.
However, many studies including ours identified no significant association between BMD values and compression rate progression in OVCF.8,14,15,20One study has indicated that a T-score of < −2.5 was associated with a higher risk of fracture deterioration,12and Okuwaki et al.17suggested that lower serum 25(OH)D levels, which indicate vitamin D status, were correlated with increased compression rate 6 months after fracture.
This observation highlights the clinical importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in patients with OVCF to prevent the progression of compression.
BMI has also been extensively discussed in the context of OVCF.
Sohn et al.20and Zhang et al.12have reported that patients with BMI > 23 kg/m2had a significant increase in kyphotic deformity, whereas Jeon et al.14confirmed the association between BMI and compression rate progression.
However, other studies, including ours, found no statistically significant association between BMI and compression rate progression.8,15,16,17This discrepancy could be attributed to the additional biomechanical load that accompanies obesity, which may contribute to compression progression in certain cases.
The initial compression rate was also examined as a potential predictor.
Yun et al.15have suggested that initial height loss was not significantly related to OVCF progression or deterioration.
However, in our study, an initial compression rate of < 30% was statistically associated with greater compression rate progression in the univariate and multivariate analyses.
We also examined the history of osteoporosis medication use and pelvic incidence as potential predictors of compression rate progression.
No significant associations were identified between prior osteoporosis medication use, pelvic incidence, or body compression rate progression.
Additionally, we also analyzed critical timeframes for compression rate progression in OVCF, revealing that the initial compression rates < 30% and progression within the first month after injury were significantly correlated with higher compression rates.
This suggests that the initial and first-month periods are critical, in patients with an initial compression rate of < 30%, the probability that the compression will progress is high, so X-ray imaging should be performed weekly for the first month.
If the compression rate progresses, vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty can be considered to prevent further progression in patients with OVCF.
Although significant differences between the progression (+) and progression (−) groups were noted, clinically, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of VAS must be ≥ 1.0, and the MCID of ODI must be ≥ 10 to be considered actual improvement.
In this study, the VAS of 0.52 and the ODI of 1.16 between the two groups failed to reach the MCID; however, it was statistically significant, so a difference in some degree of improvement could be considered.
This study has several limitations.
First, as a retrospective, single-institution study, the data is limited to a single hospital’s records.
Second, the relatively small sample size may have limited statistical power to conclusively determine the significance of the evaluated risk factors.
Further research with larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up periods is necessary to validate these findings and support the clinical guidelines for OVCF management.
In conclusion, an initial compression rate of < 30% was the strongest predictor of compression rate progression in OVCF.
Furthermore, the first month after the fracture was identified as the most critical period influencing the progression of the compression rate.
Therefore, when administering conservative treatment to patients with OVCF, clinicians should consider more frequent monitoring and more aggressive management for those presenting with an initial compression rate of < 30%, particularly during the first month after injury, to help mitigate compression rate progression.
