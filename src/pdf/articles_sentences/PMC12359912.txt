Since the concept of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was proposed, numerous studies have assessed patients and their family members.
However, a wide range of assessment timings has been employed across previous studies.
This study aimed to clarify how assessment timings have been implemented in existing PICS research through a scoping review, and to explore expert opinions on optimal assessment timing via an online survey.
We conducted a scoping review of studies assessing PICS-related outcomes, including physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments, as well as PICS in family members.
Studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL, and screened by two independent pairs of reviewers.
Eligible studies were published between January 2014 and December 2022.
Studies lacking a clear description of assessment timing were excluded.
We analyzed the reference point used to determine assessment schedules, the assessment time points, and their frequency.
Additionally, an online questionnaire was administered to 23 members of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine PICS committee and working group members to collect expert opinions on these three aspects for clinical research.
A total of 657 studies were included.
In prior studies, hospital discharge was the most commonly used reference point for determining assessment schedule (240 studies, 40%).
However, ICU discharge was identified by experts as the ideal reference point (16 votes, 47%).
The most frequently used assessment time points were 3 months (262, 23%), 6 months (212, 19%), and 12 months (206, 18%) post-discharge.
Experts most commonly selected the period between 6 and 12 months as the optimal time point for assessment.
While single assessments were most common in previous studies (337, 51%), experts considered three assessments to be ideal (12, 44%).
This study revealed notable discrepancies between the assessment timing reported in previous studies and the opinions of experts regarding optimal timing.
Standardization of assessment timing in PICS research is warranted to enhance methodological consistency and comparability.

Recent developments in intensive care medicine have significantly reduced the mortality rates of critically ill patients [1,2].
Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) refers to the long-lasting physical, cognitive and psychological impairments experienced by patients after surviving intensive care, which contribute to a diminished quality of life (QOL) [3].
The proposal of PICS has increased the attention in the field of intensive care medicine toward improving the QOL of ICU survivors.
Numerous studies have been conducted in response to the growing interest in PICS.
It has been reported that more than half of ICU survivors experience one or more symptoms of PICS after hospital discharge [4].
Approximately 90% of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors reported persistent declines in physical function during a 5-year follow-up period [5].
Cognitive dysfunction affected nearly 50% of ICU survivors during a 1-year follow-up [6].
Furthermore, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) persisted over a 2-year follow-up period, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 40% [7].
As mentioned, longitudinal studies provide important insights into the long-term outcomes of PICS.
However, variations in assessment tools and timing across studies complicate the integration and comparison of study results.
Our group previously conducted a scoping review using a modified Delphi method to recommend instruments for assessing PICS [8].
Other studies have also explored the optimal instruments for PICS assessments [9,10].
With respect to the timing of assessments, the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends screening PICS-related impairments within 2 to 4 weeks following hospital discharge, with continued reassessments throughout the recovery process [11].
However, the timing of continued reassessments has not been clarified.
It is important to identify the reference point used to determine assessment schedules, the assessment time points, and their frequency.
Standardizing the timing of assessment to reduce methodological heterogeneity represents a critical step toward advancing future research on PICS.
Reviewing the assessment timing used in previous studies is essential for understanding previous research trends.
However, the optimal timing of assessment may vary depending on the specific context and objectives of each study.
Therefore, expert opinions are required for the interpretation of the scoping review findings.
Summarizing the perspectives of PICS experts will provide further valuable insights into determining the optimal assessment timing for future PICS studies.
The two objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the assessment timing in previous PICS studies through a scoping review, and (2) to summarize expert opinions on the optimal timing through an expert survey.
We utilized data from a previously conducted study that employed a scoping review and a modified Delphi method to recommend instruments for PICS assessment [8].
The original study was registered as a clinical trial (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: 000049634).
As this is a post hoc analysis of a scoping review based on publicly available data from databases, approval from an ethics committee was not required.
The original scoping review screened studies evaluating PICS-related outcomes including physical, cognitive, and mental health, QOL, activities of daily living, PICS-family (PICS-F) domains, and other domains in patients discharged from the ICU.
The following databases were searched: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) via PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) [8].
The search covered publication from 2014 to December 2022.
Eligible studies included observational studies and randomized controlled trials enrolling adult ICU survivors (≥ 18 years old) and/or their family members, with PICS assessments conducted at hospital discharge or later.
Exclusion criteria included review articles, study protocols, trial registries, case reports, conference abstracts, and non-English-language publications.
Detailed search strategies are presented in Additional File1.
After duplicate removal, studies were screened in two stages using Rayyan, according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Screening was independently conducted by two pairs of reviewers (K.T., A.K., M.O., S.K.).
Titles and abstracts were screened in the first stage, and full texts in the second.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion or, if needed, by a third reviewer (N.Nakanishi).
An additional screening was performed to include only studies that clearly specified the timing of PICS assessments.
Studies lacking a representative assessment timing or exhibiting considerable variability across patients (e.g., several months or years) were excluded.
This screening was conducted by a single reviewer (K.T.).
The following outcomes were extracted: (1) reference point used to determine assessment schedules, (2) assessment time point, and (3) frequency of assessment.
Furthermore, we analyzed the assessment interval between each assessment time point.
Assessment time point and frequency of assessment were classified into each PICS domain including physical, cognitive, mental health, QOL, and PICS-F.
For studies assessing multiple domains, data were counted separately under each corresponding domain.
Assessment time point referred to when assessments were conducted, regardless of reference point.
These were classified as ICU discharge, hospital discharge, within 1 month, monthly, or yearly.
When only planned timing was described in the methods, it was used as the representative assessment time point.
If results included actual timing, that was recorded.
Initial and final assessments were also analyzed separately.
The reference points for PICS assessments were not taken into account in this analysis; for instance, “1 month after discharge” and “1 month after ICU discharge” were both categorized simply as “1 month.” Additionally, the assessment time points were summarized separately for the initial and final assessments.
If a study conducted only a single assessment, the assessment time point was counted in both the initial and final categories.
Frequency was defined as the total number of assessments per study.
Intervals between assessments were categorized as within 1 month, monthly, or yearly.
In studies with multiple assessments, all intervals were calculated and categorized accordingly.
The expert survey was conducted among all 23 members of the PICS committee and working group of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine.
The survey explored the following: (1) optimal reference point used to determine assessment schedules, (2) optimal assessment time point, (3) optimal frequency of assessment.
The questionnaire is shown in Additional File2.
Multiple selections and open-ended responses were allowed.
Two rounds of surveys were conducted in August and November 2024.
After the first round, an online meeting was held to discuss questionnaire content and clarify its intent.
Reminders were sent until all members responded, and full participation was achieved in both rounds.
A total of 5,160 studies were screened, and 754 studies were included in the previous review [8].
After further screening for clarity of assessment timing, 657 studies were included in the current analysis (Fig.1).
All included articles are listed in Additional File3.
The number of studies assessing each PICS domain was as follows: physical function (n = 261), cognitive function (n = 133), mental health (n = 242), QOL (n = 273), and PICS-F (n = 69).
Figure2presents the distribution of reference points used to determine the assessment schedules.
Hospital discharge was the most common (n = 240, 40%), followed by ICU discharge (n = 190, 32%), and ICU admission (n = 123, 21%).
Figure3summarizes the PICS assessment time points.
Across all studies, a total of 1,131 assessments were counted.
The most frequent time points were 3 months (n = 262, 23%), 6 months (n = 212, 19%), and 12 months (n = 206, 18%).
Assessments at ICU and hospital discharge occurred 73 (6%) and 85 (8%) times, respectively.
Only 34 (3%) assessments were conducted within 1 month post-discharge, and 89 (8%) occurred more than 1 year post-discharge.
The first and final assessments most commonly occurred at 3 and 12 months, respectively.
Domain-specific timing data are provided in Additional File4.
The frequency of PICS assessment is shown in Fig.4.
The most common frequency was a single assessment (n = 337 studies, 51%), followed by two (n = 187, 28%) and three (n = 90, 14%) assessments.
Only 43 studies (7%) conducted four or more assessments.
Timing and frequency patterns were generally consistent across different PICS domains.
Intervals are summarized in Additional File5, with 3-month (n = 131, 27%) and 6-month (n = 102, 21%) intervals being most common.
Studies with two assessment time points most frequently used 6-month intervals, while those with three assessments typically used 3-month intervals.
The participating experts comprised 16 physicians (median years of experience: 19), 3 nurses (22), and 4 physical therapists (32). The survey results are summarized in Table1.
ICU discharge was the most commonly selected reference point (n = 16, 69.6%), followed by hospital discharge (n = 10, 43.5%).
The most frequently chosen assessment time point was from 6 to 12 months (n = 12, 52.2%).
The optimal frequency was three assessments (n = 12, 52.2%), followed by two assessments (n = 8, 34.8%).
The complete response data from the 23 experts are presented in Additional File6.
This study revealed discrepancies between practices in previous studies and expert recommendations regarding PICS assessment timing.
Most prior studies used hospital discharge as the reference point, whereas experts preferred ICU discharge, aligning with the concept of “post-intensive care” and enabling the tracking of patients.
Regarding the assessment time points, previous studies commonly set them at 3, 6, and 12 months.
PICS experts also indicated that assessments would be better conducted between 6 and 12 months.
While the optimal frequency of PICS assessments according to experts was three times in total, most previous studies conducted only a single assessment.
The reference point at ICU discharge has the advantage of clarifying how long symptoms persist following ICU discharge, aligning with the “post-intensive care syndrome” definition.
On the other hand, the reference point at hospital discharge is beneficial to determine the follow-up schedule after hospital discharge.
However, the use of ICU or hospital discharge as a reference point has a disadvantage because the length of ICU or hospital stay is different among patients.
The length is affected by various factors such as patients’ background, treatment, and hospital policies [12–15].
In contrast, reference point at ICU admission is determined by a single criterion that the patient required intensive care.
Given these influences, ICU admission as a reference point has the advantage of being a more objective and uniform reference point among different patients.
Regarding assessment time points, there was a notable similarity between previous studies and the expert survey results at 6 and 12 months post-discharge.
To our knowledge, no prior studies have specifically examined the rationale for selecting assessment time points for PICS, and it was based on precedent.
On the other hand, the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends screening PICS-related problems within 1 month after discharge [11].
The discrepancy from our results reflects differing objectives.
The Society of Critical Care Medicine guidance is intended for clinical practice, emphasizing early screening and follow-up, whereas our study focused on the methodological aspects of clinical research.
In clinical research, assessments should be scheduled to observe the longitudinal trend.
There is longitudinal fluctuation of PICS symptoms.
Physical function tends to improve over time, with notable recovery in mobility and muscle strength over 2 years [16,17].
The most substantial improvements appear to occur within the first 6 months after discharge [18–21].
In contrast, while some studies have reported short-term improvements in cognitive function and mental health [22–24], these impairments often persist in the long term [25].
Notably, patients with moderate to severe cognitive impairment showed minimal change over several years [26].
Further, mental health symptoms showed patterns of remission and relapse during 2-year follow-up periods [7].
Regarding PICS-F, prevalence rates declined during the first 6 months but remained relatively stable thereafter [27].
Taken together, these findings suggest that symptom stabilization is observed after 6 months following discharge.
Therefore, to capture a reliable picture of post-ICU sequelae, it may be optimal to conduct assessment between 6 and 12 months after discharge.
The most common response among the experts was that PICS should be assessed three times, whereas previous studies most frequently employed a single assessment.
This difference may be attributed to the increased workload associated with frequent assessments, which can impact the feasibility of conducting studies.
Furthermore, increasing the number of assessments also raises the risk of patient dropout.
In fact, studies that conducted multiple assessments reported dropouts at each follow-up point [28].
Although three assessments were considered the optimal frequency by experts, the associated workload and potential dropout rates should be carefully considered.
This study has several limitations.
First, this scoping review and expert survey cannot determine the optimal timing of PICS assessments in clinical practice, as we focused on clinical research.
Second, the questionnaire options for assessment time points were categorized rather broadly, as it is difficult to choose the detailed options for months.
Similarly, the optimal time point and frequency of assessment for each PICS domain were not addressed in our expert survey.
Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal timing of assessments for each PICS domain.
Furthermore, this study’s expert survey was limited to a small sample of 23 Japanese experts.
Given that approaches to and perceptions of PICS may vary depending on healthcare systems, the generalizability of the findings to other international settings may be limited.
Accordingly, the results should be interpreted with caution, taking into account the regional context.
Finally, the assessment time points did not account for the reference point (e.g., ICU admission, ICU discharge, or hospital discharge).
As a result, the assessment time points may vary due to the different ICU or hospital length of stay.
We identified differences between research practices and expert opinions regarding the timing of PICS assessments through a scoping review and expert survey.
Further research of optimal timing is needed to reduce methodological heterogeneity in future PICS research.
