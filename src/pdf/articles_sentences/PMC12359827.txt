Simulation is a proven student-centred pedagogy, used in undergraduate nursing and midwifery education programmes as an effective strategy to support knowledge and skills development and ensure practice readiness.
In this study, simulation-based learning experiences (SBLEs) were used to redress missed learning opportunities in real-life settings during restrictive conditions.
Simulations were conducted in a safe controlled environment, affording students opportunities to practice, and develop the required skills for practice.
The study aimed to explore key informants’ perspectives on the introduction of SBLEs during a global pandemic.
A qualitative descriptive research design was chosen.
Purposeful sampling was used to invite pre-internship students (n= 95) and facilitators (n= 9) to participate in focus group interviews (FGIs) to share experiences of SBLEs conducted in one university in the South of Ireland.
A semi-structured interview guide facilitated the FGIs.
Two student FGIs were conducted (n= 10) and one FGI was conducted with facilitators (n= 6) who were either faculty members (n= 5) or clinical staff (n= 1).
An inductive thematic analysis framework was used to analyse the data.
Findings suggest that when adequately resourced with personnel and other practical resources, simulation is an effective and authentic student-centred pedagogical approach, that can support safe and effective pre-internship learning.
It was perceived to enhance practice readiness of nursing students for professional practice in the real world.
In the context of the restrictive conditions of a global pandemic it provided a safe learning environment, when public health restrictions impacted educational delivery.
Student participants reported that peer feedback was a positive aspect of the simulation experience, enhancing interactivity and promoting active engagement in the learning process.
Facilitators emphasised the importance of formal training, particularly in debriefing, as essential to the effective delivery of simulation pedagogy, ensuring both academic and psychological safety for students and staff.
They also appreciated the opportunity for informal debriefing of the debriefer, recognising it as a valuable form of reflective practice.
When formalising the integration of simulation into nursing curricula, it is essential that educators prioritise structured training for simulated participants and ensure comprehensive preparation in debriefing methodologies.
Future research should examine the long-term effects of simulation-based pedagogy on knowledge translation and the development of practice readiness among nursing students.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tertiary education is enduring as it has led to lasting changes in instructional methods, digital integration, and reduced face-to-face interactions [1].
It has presented opportunities and challenges and ultimately altered teaching and learning experiences irrevocably [1,2].
Early in the crisis, public health restrictions impacted the operating models in tertiary education [3].
Health and safety contingency plans dictated a pivot to predominantly online remote delivery.
This posed challenges such as digital fatigue and inequitable access to technology but also presented successes like greater flexibility and the integration of innovative teaching tools involving new online platforms and digital technologies, in tandem with social distancing measures and reduced face-to-face interactions.
As the tertiary education sector adapted, there were additional dimensions and consequences for students and educators of healthcare professional programmes [3], such as nursing and midwifery, professions which require hands-on practical skills development across the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains.
This necessitated essential face-to-face education provision and interaction in some limited circumstances, despite restrictive public health measures.
While acknowledging that there are considerable variations in the provision of undergraduate nursing and midwifery education internationally, which may influence the generalisability of the findings across different educational contexts [4], it is common that most programmes incorporate some variation of a clinical internship component, where final year students gain practical experience and avail of opportunities to bridge theory and practice in real life clinical practice [5].
As the pandemic unfolded, safety concerns and complexities in the health care environment, especially in the early stages of the crisis, resulted in reduced opportunities for safe student engagement [6].
This paper reports students’, faculty members’ and clinical facilitators’ perspectives on a simulation-based approach to learning, adopted during a global pandemic, coinciding with restrictive public health measures.
Simulation-based learning experiences (SBLEs) were introduced during the pandemic as a student-centred, dynamic, and creative teaching and learning strategy to prepare nursing and midwifery students for internship and the professional transition to fast-paced real-life healthcare environments.
Simulation is endorsed by the World Health Organisation and others as a reliable and credible pedagogy that promotes high-quality educational standards, providing students with opportunities to practice in a safe controlled environment, facilitating knowledge translation from classroom to practice and supporting the acquisition of knowledge, experience and skills needed to become practice-ready professionals [7–11].
The alignment between simulation pedagogy and experiential learning theory (ELT) [12,13] underscores the value of simulation as a pedagogical tool.
Kolb’s theory formed the theoretical foundation for this study as a robust framework for understanding how nursing and midwifery students experience learning clinical knowledge and skills through simulation [12,13].
Each of the four stages of the ELT (1) Concrete Experience, (2) Reflective Observation, (3) Abstract Conceptualization, and (4) Active Experimentation, were systematically applied throughout the learning process.
The SBLEs offered a concrete experience by immersing students in realistic clinical scenarios that replicate the complexities of actual patient care.
Following the simulation, reflective observation was facilitated through structured debriefing sessions, where learners critically examined their actions, decisions, and emotional responses.
This reflection also supported abstract conceptualisation, enabling students to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical insights and identify areas for improvement.
Finally, active experimentation was an intended outcome of the SBLEs where students could apply their newly acquired understanding in subsequent simulations or internship, reinforcing learning and promoting the development of clinical judgment.
This approach emphasises learning through simulation as a dynamic and holistic process that involves the integration of thinking, feeling, perceiving, and acting which are fundamental to Kolb’s experiential learning theory [12–14].
While much of the existing nursing literature on perceptions of a simulation-based approach to learning relies predominantly on single-informant perspectives, there remains a notable gap in studies that incorporate insights from multiple informants.
To address this, the present study employs data triangulation, drawing on data from a range of sources, including students, faculty members, and clinical facilitators to achieve a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of simulation practices.
This approach strengthens the credibility of the findings and mitigates the potential biases associated with reliance on a single data source.
Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to addresses the existing gap by exploring key informants’ experiences of SBLEs for undergraduate nursing and midwifery students, introduced during a pandemic.
The study aimed to explore key informants’ experiences of SBLEs for undergraduate nursing and midwifery students, introduced during a pandemic.
A qualitative descriptive research design was chosen due to its suitability for capturing comprehensive accounts of participant experiences and perspectives in a naturalistic setting.
The study setting was a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in the South of Ireland.
Ethical approval was granted from the Faculty of Education and Health Sciences Research University Ethics Committee (Reference Number: 2020_06_17_EHS).
The simulation initiative used a standardised approach to integrating simulation pedagogy across the undergraduate programmes, underpinned by the internationalHealthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice(HSSOPB) [15].
This involved an established structured approach comprising a pre-briefing stage, the clinical scenario, and a de-briefing stage, all of which were conducted face-to-face with students.
While some fundamental pre-briefing occurred online in advance (e.g., what to expect on the day), a structured formal pre-briefing occurred at the start of all face-to-face scenarios.
A unique aspect of the adopted approach was the co-design and development of the clinical scenarios by the key informants, comprising faculty members, an educational technologist, clinical facilitator partners across four healthcare sites, and student representatives across the four relevant undergraduate programmes.
Clinical scenarios were tailored to year-four students’ needs and included (1)A Birth Complicated by Shoulder Dystociafor the BSc Midwifery programme, (2)Medication Refusalfor the BSc Nursing (Intellectual Disability) programme, (3)Glasgow Coma Scale Assessmentfor the BSc Nursing (General) programme and (4)Risk Assessment and De-escalation techniquesfor the BSc Nursing (Mental Health) programme.
The de-briefing was supported using the PEARLS [Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation] debriefing tool [16].
Fourteen SBLEs were implemented, each session lasting one-hour with approximately 6–8 students.
During this time, 95 out of 112 students across year-four of the undergraduate programmes attended and completed SBLEs.
Participants were recruited using purposeful sampling from four undergraduate nursing and midwifery programmes at one HEI in Ireland, chosen to ensure the inclusion of diverse perspectives from various specialisations and experiences aligned with the study’s aim of exploring a range of informants.
The target population consisted of students (n= 95) and faculty members and clinical facilitators (n= 9) that met the following inclusion criteria: year four students registered on the Bachelor of Science (BSc) Nursing (Mental Health, General, or Intellectual Disability) and BSc Midwifery programmes who had participated in the SBLEs outlined above in discipline-specific consolidation modules in Autumn Semester 2020; or faculty members and clinical facilitators that were involved in the development, facilitation and delivery of the SBLEs in any of the related modules.
Potential participants were recruited by a researcher who was not directly involved in the module teaching team or SBLEs.
Participants were invited to participate via the university email system and by an advertisement on Moodle (virtual learning platform) with study information and contact details included.
Recruitment was challenging as it took place after module completion, and students were on their clinical internship placement, at a time when restrictive public health measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic were in place.
This may have limited participant availability and the diversity of responses, potentially impacting the comprehensiveness of the data collected.
Twelve students from the target population volunteered to participate and ten were available and contributed, while six of the nine faculty members and clinical facilitators volunteered and contributed.
Data collection involved focus group interviews with students and facilitators held online due to public health restrictions using the University’s preferred platform Microsoft Teams.
To comply with data protection regulations, audio recordings were stored on a password-protected encrypted laptop, either in OneDrive or on the hard-drive.
Consent to participate was captured in one of three ways: (1) using electronic signature, (2) by return email with a photo of the printed and signed consent form attached, or (3) by capturing individual verbal consent on the audio-recordings.
Two semi-structured interview guides were developed, one for student interviews (see supplementary file1) and the other for facilitator focus groups (see supplementary file2).
The guides were developed by the researchers, informed by the literature and the research aim.
They were reviewed by a subject-matter expert to establish trustworthiness.
The guides were revised and refined based on the feedback.
Interviews were facilitated by experienced researchers (LK, KM, PM, LM) who were not involved in the module teaching teams and simulations.
Researchers introduced key information such as voluntary participation and confidentiality, before proceeding with the online interviews.
Participants were reminded that they could withdraw from the study at any time and a distress protocol was in place should any participant become upset during the interview.
Consistent with recommendations by Muthanna and Alduais [17], reflexivity was embedded throughout the research process to ensure researchers remained critically attuned to how their positionality and conduct can influence group dynamics and shape the processes of data collection, analysis, and the interpretation of findings.
Reflexivity was maintained throughout data collection using field notes and reflective journaling during and after each focus group.
Two student FGIs were conducted, one with seven students and one with three students.
Distribution of participant numbers across FGIs was dependant on availability and willingness to partake.
Both groups were asked the same set of questions by the same interviewer and the same note taker was present in both interviews.
One FGI with facilitators was conducted by another interviewer and another note taker, with six of the nine staff who facilitated the simulations, either faculty members (n= 5) or clinical facilitators (n= 1).
Faculty members and clinical facilitators are collectively referred to as “facilitators” for the remainder of the paper.
The average interview duration was 42 min.
Inductive thematic analysis was undertaken to analyse the data using Braun and Clarkes [18] six stage framework which involved: reading the data (LK, KM, LM); identification of initial codes (LK, KM); a review of themes in accordance with the codes generated from the data (LK, KM); labelling of themes and explanation of same (LK, KM, LM) and completing write up of findings (LK, KM).
No software was utilised when analysing the data, as the researchers aimed to maintain a hands-on approach to data interpretation, and participant checking of themes was not undertaken due to logistical constraints during the pandemic, which may have limited the opportunity for verifying interpretations directly with participants.
Due to the small number of participants and to protect confidentiality and anonymity data was analysed by student or facilitator group and was not analysed by student discipline or by the academic or clinical field of facilitators.
Maintaining reflexivity during data analysis informed the generation of codes and themes that were grounded in the data rather than shaped by researchers’ preconceptions or biases.
Reflective field notes, data analysis team meetings and peer debriefing were key reflexivity approaches adopted to critically examine how researchers’ backgrounds, assumptions, and relationships with participants could influence data collection and interpretation.
The analysis team (LK; KM; LM) remained open to the data and consciously avoided premature thematic conclusions.
Through collaborative and reflexive discussions, themes were critically reviewed and refined until consensus was reached that they aligned with participants’ narratives.
The FGIs were facilitated by researchers on the team experienced in qualitative methods and with no direct supervisory relationship with participants, to help minimise power imbalances.
When no new codes or themes emerged during analysis of the FGI transcripts, data saturation was considered reached.
This took place after conducting one FGI with facilitators (n= 6) and two FGIs with students (n= 7 andn= 3).
The research team reviewed transcripts regularly throughout the data collection process to assess saturation.
All transcripts were recorded and transcribed verbatim ensuring accuracy of participant responses.
Two members of the team identified initial themes (LK, KM).
Transparency was ensured by writing annotations on each transcript and formulating a coding tree (LK, KM).
While participant checking was not possible due to logistical constraints, to enhance dependability and confirmability peer examination of the process was used among the research team (LK, KM, LM) with discussion and agreement of themes amongst the researchers (LK, KM, LM).
Further enhancing credibility and dependability, the presence of the note taker helped ensure that the data collection process was consistent and reliable contributing to the trustworthiness of the study.
Rigour was maintained by ensuring the researchers collecting and analysing the focus group data were not involved in the SBLE’s, which minimised potential biases and ensured a more objective interpretation of participant experiences, thereby, avoiding any conflict that may have potentially affected the interpretation of the data [19].
The findings are presented in two sections: student focus group data followed by facilitator focus group data.
An integrated analysis is provided at the conclusion of the findings section, with areas of overlap and divergence further explored in the discussion.
Thematic analysis of student focus group data resulted in the identification of two overarching themes:“Supporting Preparation for Practice”and“Cultivating Authentic Learning”, each comprising two subthemes (see Table1).
“It was a good opportunity to apply what you have learned again through theory,but you were able to apply it in a safe environment.
You know,there was no pressure really on you,if you made a mistake,you could get feedback”.
“It was definitely as I said,something that you would encounter on a day-to-day basis and very relevant”.
“I kind of think it was helpful to my learning rather than theory and learning off a book and watching videos,it’s just kind of being there and experiencing it yourself like”.
The theme“Supporting Preparation for Practice”captures participants’ perceptions of simulation as a valuable tool for enhancing practice readiness, particularly during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Key aspects included the creation of a psychologically safe learning environment, the development of decision-making skills, and the provision of structured, hands-on practice opportunities.
Opportunities to apply theory to practice in the safety of a simulated learning environment, was highly valued by participants.
Specifically, it helped reduce the anxieties associated with learning and making mistakes.
This helped with creating awareness of knowledge and skill deficits, which motivated students to reflect, ask questions and consolidate learning in a safe environment.
Participants valued the opportunity afforded for face-to-face learning in the clinical skills laboratory at a time when modes of teaching delivery were predominantly online, due to COVID-19 public health restrictions.
The SBLEs provided opportunities for students to be on campus and to experience face-to-face interaction.
Students recognised the value of SBLEs in enabled students to connect with other students and build friendships at a time of extended social isolation due to the pandemic.
Simulation was described as a fun and meaningful way of learning.
Many participants reported nervousness and reluctance to participate in front of their peers and lecturers.
However, they also valued the experience once they had engaged in the SBLE.
Although, there was a sense that the unique learning opportunities in clinical practice are irreplaceable, simulation was considered “the closet thing” to replicating this in a safe environment.
Participants perceived that SBLEs take students out of their comfort zone, nurturing more responsive reactions and encouraging critical thinking.
Simulation was perceived to boost confidence and support students to accept responsibility for decision making.
The theme“Cultivating Authentic Learning”reflects student participants’ recognition of the realistic nature of SBLEs.
These simulations closely mirrored actual clinical practice, thereby fostering relevant, meaningful, and contextually grounded learning.
Peer-feedback opportunities supported learning that was meaningful to students.
SBLEs that reflected the realities of daily practice were particularly valued as a means of supporting preparation for practice and making sense of clinical practice opportunities, during a global pandemic.
SBLEs were perceived as realistic and reflecting the realities of clinical practice and therefore relevant in preparing students for practice.
One student highlighted relevance in the context of the complexities of medication administration.
Opportunities to engage with clinically relevant learning was highly valued as a mechanism to prepare students for dynamic healthcare practice.
Simulation was perceived to be effective in terms of meaningful and deep learning.
Participants valued opportunities to ‘learn by doing’ which supported more meaningful and engaged experiential learning when compared to more traditional teaching and learning methods.
Being observed and having opportunities to observe others was seen as a way of adding to the depth of learning.
Receiving peer feedback was a positive experience and reported to be “better” than facilitators led feedback.
Some participants identified with the concept of repeating the SBLE after having received feedback.
For some participants opportunities to role play the simulated patient (SP) role was particularly meaningful.
Seeing approaches to care delivery through the lens of a patient or service user was a particular strength of simulation reported.
However, other students felt that incorporating trained actors in SBLE would make the scenario more real.
Participants valued the opportunity both during and following the SBLE to focus on evidenced-based learning.
Thematic analysis of facilitator focus group data resulted in the identification of two overarching themes: “Student-centred Pedagogy”and“Embracing Teamwork”, each comprising two subthemes (see Table2).
“that was really beneficial to individually talk them through their scenarios and ask,and if they had any questions or worries,to deal with that”.
“I loved working in the team and being involved with….
(Clinical Facilitator) and…… (Educational Technologist) in developing the script”.
“to have it as a learning experience,and that’s a much safer way”.
“you’re using the simulation in such a formalised way,was new and I definitely had to,I definitely built my confidence”.
The theme“Student-Centred Pedagogy”captures facilitators’ recognition of simulation as a supportive, learner-focused approach, particularly valuable during the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Facilitators emphasised the critical role of psychological safety and the creation of nurturing, inclusive learning environments to support student engagement and development.
There was a sense that COVID-19 negatively impacted on student preparation for simulation due to implementation of public health restrictions.
COVID-19 affected the SP role, leading to students stepping in for trained SP actors.
Opinions varied on this approach: some felt it was “not an ideal approach” and stressed the “need for a safe environment” for students in this role.
Others believed students could enhance the scenarios and benefit from the role-playing experience.
There was a consensus that students should volunteer for this role and that “clear role expectations” are essential.
Participants believed the debriefing stage should provide constructive feedback with an emphasis on positive reinforcement.
This method would help alleviate students’ negative perceptions of their performance in the SP role while also identifying areas for improvement.
Participants were keenly aware that as this was a new learning modality for students, additional student support was needed, and they valued the pre-simulation resources that had been provided to students in advance which supported “student preparation” for simulation and “clarity of expectations and around scenarios and their role.” There was a strong sense of the value of simulation in preparing students for clinical practice placement and in “building student confidence.” The pre-briefing stage was once again highlighted as valuable in supporting learning.
Participants considered that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the time and opportunity for preparatory academic and peer support, as teaching delivery during this time was predominantly online.
The simulation afforded students an opportunity to re-connect and facilitators considered this positively impacted the environment.
“the people that did turn up,were so delighted to be in,they really were starved of that connection,and they,they were quite celebratory,they were delighted”.
Participants strongly supported the concept of simulation as a learning opportunity rather than an assessment tool and considered this provided a “safe way for students to learn” in a realistic, safe setting.
The theme“Embracing Teamwork”reflects facilitators’ collaborative efforts in designing and implementing SBLEs.
This process involved pooling diverse expertise, working cohesively in teams, and developing new skills to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the simulation pedagogy.
A team approach to facilitators support was adopted, with collaboration encompassing the support of an education technologist, peer support and collaboration with clinicians.
There was consensus that the supportive role of the educational technologist in simulation preparation, delivery and debriefing was pivotal to the success of the SBLEs.
Preparatory support included scenario planning and development and preparation of simulation materials, while support during the SBLEs involved practical hands-on support for facilitators.
Facilitators worked in small teams to deliver SBLEs and there was consensus that this worked well as facilitators availed of peer-support or educational technologist support when running the simulations.
While a partnership approach with clinical service partners was not always possible due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a keen sense of opportunity to build on this approach in the future.
The “knowledge and expertise” of clinical partners was recognised as adding to the robustness of the SBLEs.
Some participants had little simulation experience, while others spoke of extensive past experience of adopting role play techniques and bringing this skill set and expertise to the simulations.
There was a sense of skill development and learning “in action” though peer support and formative feedback and participants expressed their growing confidence as they became more experienced in running the SBLE.
Participants acknowledged the need for professional development or training in building a particular skill set in simulation pedagogy for example pre-briefing and debriefing training.
The findings from both student and facilitators focus groups collectively emphasise the value of SBLEs in nursing and midwifery education during the pandemic.
Both groups highlighted the importance of safe, controlled environments for practice and decision-making skill development.
Facilitators feedback further stressed the psychological safety and structured support necessary for effective learning.
Common themes across groups included the importance of preparation, engagement, and authentic learning experiences.
This integration reveals the mutual reinforcement of positive outcomes from both student and facilitators perspectives, underscoring the importance of simulation in enhancing clinical competence and preparedness for real-world practice.
This study explored the experiences of students, faculty members, and clinical facilitators during the implementation of SBLEs aimed at preparing students for internship.
The implementation occurred in the context of significant educational disruptions caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Undoubtedly, the pandemic added a new layer of complexity to supporting the ‘practice readiness’ of nursing and midwifery students for internship and future roles, with the literature reporting some students witnessing extreme challenges with providing safe care, with unprecedented high volumes of acutely ill patients, lack of resources and growing demands on staff and students leading to increased stress and anxiety [20–23].
Within a rapidly evolving complex healthcare system, there is a growing need for graduate nurses and midwives to be ‘practice ready’ and fit for purpose, practice, and award [24] and to be adept at knowledge transfer [11].
In this study participants highly valued simulation as an opportunity to practice and rehearse ways of responding to the growing complexities and challenges in healthcare settings.
Students and facilitators described how simulation helped build confidence and improve decision-making skills and problem-solving abilities, key skills required for safe and responsive clinical practice, particularly during a global pandemic.
Previously reported in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is the need to intensify undergraduate nurse teaching to boost competency and readiness to practice [25].
This practice readiness was important for student participants in this study who were coming to the end of their theoretical programme content and were nearing commencement of their internship.
Like the reporting in our study, Nevin and colleagues [26] reported that students regarded simulation-based learning as an effective pedagogical approach for internship preparation, particularly in fostering critical thinking and facilitating the application of theoretical knowledge to clinical practice.
Additionally, Ragsdale [27] highlighted the perceived enhancement of clinical reasoning skills through simulation, emphasising its significance in promoting practice readiness.
Our findings support the contention that simulation supports the development of practice-ready professionals [26,27].
The authenticity of SBLEs is regarded as a fundamental component of effective simulation-based pedagogy in health professions education [28–30] and particularly in the context of the pandemic [31].
In the current study students perceived that simulation supported authentic learning through engagement in scenarios that closely mirrored real clinical situations.
They reported that the skills developed during SBLEs were directly transferable to real-world clinical contexts, arguably enhancing practice-readiness.
The authenticity of the SBLEs was identified as a critical factor in facilitating meaningful knowledge translation, thereby enhancing students’ readiness to navigate the complexities of actual clinical practice during the unprecedented global pandemic.
Due to public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, students in this study were required to assume the role of simulated patients (SPs) in place of trained actors.
This adaptation, while aligned with the applied SP approach outlined in the Healthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice (HSSOBP®) [15], and consistent with ELT [12,13] introduced a complex pedagogical and ethical dilemma.
The practice of learners portraying roles other than themselves is not without precedent; however, its rapid implementation during a global pandemic raised concerns among participants about authenticity, emotional safety, and educational integrity.
There was a lack of consensus among students regarding the appropriateness of this adaptation.
While some students found value in the opportunity to “step inside” the patient role, gaining insight into care delivery from the perspective of a service user, returning to the concept of authenticity others struggled to suspend disbelief and felt that trained actors would have enhanced the authenticity and educational value of the simulation.
This finding aligns with earlier research findings from Lockertsen and colleagues [28] who report a perception among nursing students that the standardised patient who had clinical qualifications, made the simulation feel authentic and realistic and that not having a former relationship with the person acting as the standardised patient enhanced authenticity.
Muckler [32] on the other hand cautions that for simulation to be effective learners need to suspend disbelief and resist judgment of the simulation’s authenticity.
Facilitator perspectives were similarly divided on learners assuming the SP role.
Some viewed the adaptation as a creative and necessary response to unprecedented constraints.
Others expressed concerns about the academic and psychological safety of students placed in emotionally charged roles without adequate preparation or support and were acutely aware that an educational environment in which the student does not feel academically safe is not conducive to learning and growth [33].
This situation underscores a broader ethical challenge in simulation pedagogy: balancing innovation and necessity with the duty of care to learners.
Ganley and Linnard-Palmer [33] explored students and faculty members perceptions of academic safety during simulation highlighting the importance of recognising that stress and anxiety may impede learning.
The absence of formal SP training in this study, particularly in areas such as role preparation, emotional debriefing, and feedback, further complicated the learning environment.
Moreover, this experience reflects a wider tension in nursing education during the pandemic, where simulation was rapidly scaled to compensate for lost clinical placements [34,35].
While simulation proved to be a resilient and adaptable pedagogical tool, its implementation often outpaced the development of ethical frameworks and support systems necessary to ensure its safe and effective use with researchers advocating post-pandemic for formal implementation policies and regulation in some situations [36,37].
Given the emotional and cognitive demands of the SP role, especially when enacted by undergraduate novice learners, future initiatives should prioritise structured SP training to uphold international best practices and safeguard learner wellbeing.
A novel contribution of this study is the finding that students expressed a preference for peer feedback over facilitator feedback during SBLEs.
This preference has important implications for pedagogical design, particularly when viewed through the lens of ELT.
Kolb’s ELT conceptualises learning as a cyclical process involving concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation, and active experimentation, with learners actively constructing knowledge through the transformation of experience [38].
ELT emphasises that learning is most effective when students are engaged as active participants, drawing on their own experiences and interacting with others to co-create understanding [13].
This aligns with the expressed preference for peer feedback among participants in this study, which supports the social and reflective dimensions of learning.
In contexts where traditional face-to-face interaction is limited, such as during a pandemic, peer feedback mechanisms can sustain engagement, foster reflective practice, and preserve the collaborative nature of learning.
Embedding structured peer feedback into SBLEs not only enhances feedback literacy and critical thinking but also reinforces the learner-centred, constructivist foundations of experiential learning [12,13].
Facilitators in this study identified a clear need for debriefing training.
Formal debriefing training is widely recognised as a critical component in the development of effective debriefing skills and is well documented in the literature [39,40].
However, a less extensively explored concept is that of “debriefing the debriefer”, a process involving structured reflection, feedback and performance appraisal directed at those conducting the debriefings.
A novel contribution of this study is the identification of the value SBLE facilitators place on receiving immediate feedback and support following SBLEs.
Specifically, participants reported that engaging with each other and an educational technologist to review the simulation process and reflect critically on their own debriefing performance was particularly beneficial.
This aligns with Fanning and Gaba’s [40] assertion that regular performance appraisal is a critical component of effective debriefing and Mulvogue and colleagues’ [41] contention that self-reflection is essential for all facilitators engaged in debriefing.
To support faculty development in medical education, O’Shea et al. [42].
introduced a formal “debriefing the debrief” programme, which utilises recorded debriefing sessions to guide reflective practice.
This structured approach is grounded in Kolb’s ELT, emphasising continuous cycles of reflection, conceptualisation, experimentation, and experience.
Similarly, Reunis et al. [43]., in a small-scale UK-based study (n= 6), found that peer-reviewed feedback during debriefing sessions positively influenced future performance and enhanced facilitator confidence.
Incorporating a structured “debriefing the debriefer” step into simulation-based education, particularly in nursing, may serve as a valuable quality assurance mechanism.
While existing models such as those described by Fanning and Gaba [40] and O’Shea et al. [42].
focus on post-event formal appraisal, our findings suggest that immediate post-SBLE reflection, whether through self-appraisal, peer review, or facilitated discussion, could significantly enhance critical performance evaluation.
We recommend the formal integration of “debriefing the debriefer” into debriefing training programmes within simulation-based nurse education.
This step not only supports continuous professional development, which is essential for best practice standards in simulation education [44], but also contributes to the ongoing enhancement of debriefing quality and facilitator effectiveness which have been reported as cornerstones of effective debriefing [40,42,43,45,46].
The wider literature reports that dedicated resources are essential when introducing simulation, such as, time, funding, a repository of simulations, training, physical structures, and key personnel [8,47–50].
In this study, facilitators highly valued the role of the educational technologist in providing SBLE design and development support as well as practical hands-on assistance during SBLEs and there was a consensus that this type of support was key to success.
The benefits of capital investment in the resourcing of simulation for success are reported.
For example, in preregistration nursing education in Australia and New Zealand resources, training, best practice alignment, and robust evaluation of simulation experiences in nursing curricula are considered as pre-requisites to embedding sustainable, high-quality simulation [47].
While in this instance the role was supported by funding awarded through a grant, we argue that, to build capacity and to embed simulation into curricula, core faculty support roles are essential to leading and driving simulation forward.
Dedicated infrastructure supports are also needed for sustainable simulation, for example, a simulation centre or a designated clinical skill laboratory to enable the running of low to high-fidelity simulations.
This study was conducted in one University in Ireland, therefore a cautious approach to generalisability and transferability of findings is advised.
Recruiting to focus groups was challenging as potential participants were working in clinical practice at a time of high patient acuity and other clinical challenges arising due to the pandemic.
Although the target population included 95 students, only 12 volunteered, and just 10 ultimately participated in the study.
This low response rate is a significant limitation, raising concerns about self-selection bias.
Those who chose to participate may have had particularly strong opinions, positive or negative, or simply more time and motivation than their peers.
As a result, the data may not accurately reflect the broader student population, even within a single Higher Education Institution.
While the insights gathered are still valuable, they may disproportionately represent the views of more engaged or affected students, potentially skewing the overall findings.
In the findings section the impact of reduced of face-to-face interactions on SBLEs as a broader challenge brought on by the pandemic is reported.
Returning to this concept we consider that the online format of the FGIs may have affected the depth or spontaneity of the data.
Extended social isolation and the virtual setting might have made it harder for participants to build rapport or feel comfortable sharing sensitive experiences in a group context.
These dynamics could have subtly influenced the richness and openness of the discussions.
A key limitation of the study is the omission of the participant validation step outlined in Braun and Clarke’s framework [17], which is essential for enhancing the credibility of qualitative findings.
Without this step, there is a risk of misalignment between the researchers’ interpretations and the participants’ intended meanings.
Although the research team engaged in consensus discussions to strengthen the analysis, this process cannot fully substitute for direct participant validation.
As a result, confidence in the accuracy of the thematic interpretations from the participants’ perspective is reduced.
This limitation also affects the transferability of the findings, which should be understood as the researchers’ interpretations rather than fully validated representations of participant views.
Further longitudinal research is warranted to investigate the impact of sustained simulation, systematically embedded within the nursing curriculum, on learning outcomes and the effective translation of knowledge into clinical practice.
This paper reports on a SBLE initiative, introduced early in the COVID-19 pandemic to support students’ transition to clinical internship.
Findings suggest that when adequately resourced with personnel and other practical resources, simulation is perceived as an effective and authentic student-centred pedagogical approach, that can support safe and effective pre-internship learning.
