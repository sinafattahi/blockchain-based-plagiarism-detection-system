Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused byFusarium graminearumSchwabe, is one of the most devastating diseases in wheat (Triticum aestivumL.).
The synthetic hexaploid wheat line Largo was developed from a cross between the durum wheat [T.
turgidumssp.durum(Desf.)
variety Langdon and theAegilops tauschiiCosson accession PI 268210, and it was previously found to have a moderate level of FHB resistance.
This study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with FHB resistance using a population of 188 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between Largo and the susceptible wheat line ND495.
The RILs were evaluated for Type II resistance in two greenhouse and two field environments.
The disease severity and 90K single‐nucleotide polymorphism marker data were used for QTL analysis, which revealed six QTL on chromosomes 1D, 2D, 5B, and 7D.
Four QTL (QFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐5B,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) from Largo had minor effects, whereas two QTL (QFhb.rwg‐2DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.2) from ND495 showed large effects on FHB resistance.
The result suggested that ND495 may possess suppressor or susceptibility gene(s) suppressing or masking FHB resistance controlled by the resistance QTL.
Among these QTL, four coincided with previously reported QTL, includingFhb9, and two (QFhb.rwg‐1DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.1) are likely novel QTL.
From the six QTL regions, 10 Kompetitive allele‐specific PCR markers were developed and validated for marker‐assisted selection.
The QTL detected from the resistant and susceptible parents enhance our understanding of FHB resistance expression and provide new resources for improving FHB resistance in wheat.
Synthetic wheat line Largo and spring wheat line ND495 are resistant and susceptible to Fusarium head blight (FHB), respectively.
Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for FHB resistance was performed using an ND495 × Largo population of 188 NIL lines.
Six FHB‐resistant QTL were identified, with four and two from Largo and ND495, respectively.
Two QTL from Largo are likely novel, whereas the other four coincided with previously reported QTL.
Ten Kompetitive allele‐specific PCR markers for the six QTL were developed and validated.
Since the early 1990s, Fusarium head blight (FHB), primarily caused by the fungal pathogenFusarium graminearumSchwabe [synonymGibberella zeae(Schw.)
Petch], has been one of the most devastating head diseases affecting several cereal crops worldwide, including durum wheat [Triticum turgidumL.
ssp.durum(Desf.)
Husn., 2n= 4x= 28, AABB] and common wheat (Triticum aestivumL., 2n= 6x= 42, AABBDD) (M. Buerstmayr et al.,2020; Chin et al.,2023; Haile et al.,2019).
FHB is now ranked as the second most devastating wheat disease in the world after leaf rust (caused byPuccinia triticinaEriks), causing 2.85% yield loss annually, value at $5.6 billion globally (Savary et al.,2019; Wulff & Jones,2020).
In addition, the fungus produces mycotoxins, which contaminate wheat grain and threaten human and animal health (Bottalico & Perrone,2002; Pestka,2010).
To mitigate the threat from FHB outbreaks, there has been a constant need to develop resistant wheat varieties in wheat breeding programs worldwide.
Compared to other common fungal diseases such as leaf rust or stem rust (caused byP.
graminisPers.
f. sp.triticiEriks and E. Henn), breeding for FHB resistance is difficult due to its complexity.
An innate challenge is that the expression of FHB resistance in plants is highly affected by the environment and genotype × environment interactions (Miedaner et al.,2001).
Warm temperature and high humidity during flowering, when the plant is in the most sensitive development stage for fungal infection, cause a high FHB severity (Andersen,1948; Parry et al.,1995) even on resistant genotypes.
On the contrary, dry weather conditions during flowering, a critical period for disease development, often result in low FHB severity on susceptible genotypes even in mist‐irrigated nurseries (Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
Furthermore, several morphological and agronomic traits, such as plant height (PH), spike morphology, and flowering date (FD), can often affect fungal infection and/or FHB disease development (H. Buerstmayr et al.,2009; Lu et al.,2013; Mesterhazy,1995), further complicating the selection of resistant genotypes in breeding.
Another challenge for wheat breeders is that FHB resistance is a complex trait, usually controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL).
In the past two decades, >600 FHB resistance QTL across all 21 wheat chromosomes have been reported (see review by H. Buerstmayr et al.,2009; M. Buerstmayr et al.,2020; Venske et al.,2019).
However, only nine of the QTL have been formally designated asFhb1throughFhb9(review by Viviani et al.,2025).
Most of the other reported QTL had minor or moderate effects, often highly affected by environmental factors and genetic backgrounds.
Many of the FHB resistance QTL overlap with the QTL associated with morphological traits, which often mask true resistance and thus limit the efficient utilization of FHB resistance QTL in wheat breeding (H. Buerstmayr et al.,2009; M. Buerstmayr et al.,2020; Lu et al.,2013).
So far,Fhb1on chromosome 3B derived from wheat cultivar Sumai 3 has been verified to show a major effect on FHB resistance consistently, and it has been effectively used in wheat breeding programs around the world (H. Wang et al.,2020).
As a result, many wheat cultivars carryingFhb1have been developed and extensively used in production in regions with frequent FHB outbreaks since 1999 (M. Buerstmayr et al.,2020; Hao et al.,2020).
The widespread deployment ofFhb1in modern wheat cultivars worldwide can reduce losses caused by FHB.
However, the large‐scale utilization of wheat cultivars withFhb1in breeding and wheat production may pose a potential risk of FHB epidemics due to pathogen adaptation and the narrow diversity of genes for FHB resistance.
To widen the genetic sources of FHB resistance for breeding, wheat germplasms with novel resistance QTL need to be identified.
Hexaploid wheat originated from the natural hybridization between tetraploid wheat (T.turgidum) and the D genome progenitorAegilops tauschiiCoss.
(2n= 2x= 14, DD) (Cox,1997; Lev‐Yadun et al.,2000; Marcussen et al.,2014; Salamini et al.,2002).
Because only limited tetraploid wheat orAe.
tauschiigenotypes participated in the origin of hexaploid wheat, a narrow genetic diversity has been incorporated into modern hexaploid wheat germplasm (Gaurav et al.,2022; L. Zhang et al.,2008).
Although tetraploid wheat is generally more susceptible to FHB than hexaploid wheat, several resistant accessions and QTL have been identified in wild and cultivated emmer wheat (T. turgidumsubsp.dicoccoidesandT.
turgidumsubsp.dicoccum) (M. Buerstmayr et al.,2012; Oliver et al.,2008; Ruan et al.,2012; Q. Zhang et al.,2014), Persian wheat (T. turgidumsubsp.carthlicum), and durum wheat (H. Buerstmayr et al.,2003; M. Buerstmayr et al.,2013,2012; Gladysz et al.,2007; Kumar et al.,2007; Oliver et al.,2008,2007; Otto et al.,2002; Somers et al.,2006; Q. Zhang et al.,2014).
Compared to tetraploid wheat,Ae.
tauschiiis rarely evaluated for FHB resistance due to its wild, grassy characteristics.
However, Brisco et al. (2017) evaluated 109Ae.tauschiiaccessions for reactions to FHB and identified several resistant accessions.
Tetraploid wheat andAe.tauschiiaccessions with FHB resistance have not been fully utilized to improve common wheat germplasm.
One effective method of incorporating FHB resistance genes from these species into common wheat could be developing synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW, ×Aegilotriticumspp., 2n= 6x= 42, AABBDD).
Since the 1990s, numerous SHW lines have been created through crosses between various tetraploid wheat andAe.
tauschiiaccessions (Mujeeb‐Kazi et al.,2001; Ogbonnaya et al.,2013; Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018; Xu et al.,2010).
Reactions to FHB in SHW germplasm were previously investigated in several studies, resulting in the identification of multiple resistant lines (Mujeeb‐Kazi et al.,2001; Oliver et al.,2005; Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018) reported 13 SHW lines with a high level of FHB resistance.
These SHW lines may be useful for incorporating FHB resistance genes from tetraploid wheat andAe.
tauschiiinto common wheat.
Among the FHB‐resistant SHW lines identified by Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018), one line derived from a cross between the durum variety Langdon and theAe.tauschiiaccession PI 268210 was previously named Largo and released as wheat germplasm carrying geneGb3for resistance to greenbug [Schizaphis graminum(Rondani)] (Joppa & Williams,1982).
In addition to its resistance to greenbug, Largo also exhibits resistance to multiple diseases, including stem rust, FHB, tan spot [caused byPyrenophora tritici‐repentis(Died.)
Drechsler], septoria nodorum blotch [caused byParastagonospora nodorum(Berkeley) Quaedvlieg, Verkley & Crous], and septoria tritici blotch [caused byMycosphaerella graminicola(Fuckel) J.
(Adhikari et al.,2015; Friesen et al.,2008; Sharma et al.,2021; Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
A mapping population of 226 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was previously developed from the cross between hard red spring wheat line ND495 and Largo (Sharma et al.,2021).
In this study, we aimed to identify the FHB resistance QTL in the RIL population of Largo × ND495 and develop and validate user‐friendly markers for marker‐assisted selection.
Synthetic wheat line Largo and spring wheat line ND495 are resistant and susceptible to Fusarium head blight (FHB), respectively.
Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for FHB resistance was performed using an ND495 × Largo population of 188 NIL lines.
Six FHB‐resistant QTL were identified, with four and two from Largo and ND495, respectively.
Two QTL from Largo are likely novel, whereas the other four coincided with previously reported QTL.
Ten Kompetitive allele‐specific PCR markers for the six QTL were developed and validated.
Largo (CI 17895) is an SHW line developed by Dr. L. R. Joppa through a cross between durum wheat Langdon andAe.
tauschiiPI 268210 (Joppa & Williams,1982).
ND495 (pedigree: Justin*2/3/ND 259/Conley//ND 112) was developed at North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, and is susceptible to FHB.
To identify and map resistance genes in Largo, we developed a population of 226 RILs by crossing ND495 with Largo (Sharma et al.,2021).
For this study, we randomly selected 188 RILs to identify and map FHB resistance QTL.
The common wheat varieties Sumai 3 and Wheaton were used as the resistant and susceptible checks, respectively, in the FHB evaluation in the greenhouse and field nurseries.
A set of 25 SHW lines with moderate and high levels of FHB resistance reported by Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018) was used to validate the new markers linked to the QTL identified in this study.
The Type II resistance (resistance to spread in the spike) of the ND495/Largo RIL population, its parental lines, and checks (Sumai 3 and Wheaton) was assessed in two greenhouse seasons and two field environments, using the methods and procedures previously described in Chu et al. (2011), Q. Zhang et al. (2014), and Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018). A randomized complete block design with three replicates was used for all experiments.
Greenhouse experiments were conducted in winter 2018 (18GH) and spring 2019 (19GH).
Three seeds from each genotype were planted in a 6‐inch clay pot per replicate, and thus, the genotypes were represented by a total of nine plants per experiment.
The temperature was maintained at 22°C–25°C in the greenhouse, which was also supplemented with artificial light for a 16‐h photoperiod.
The inoculum was prepared at a concentration of 50,000 spores mL−1from three strains of pathogenicF.graminearum(Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
Inoculation was performed according to the point inoculation method described by Stack et al. (2002), wherein 10 µL of inoculum was injected into the central spikelet located in the middle of each spike at anthesis.
In each pot, 8–12 spikes were inoculated.
Each inoculated spike was misted using a hand sprayer and then covered with a misted 5‐inch plastic bag for 72 h (Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
Disease severity was determined by counting the number of diseased spikelets and total spikelets on each spike at 19 days post‐inoculation, and the scores were calculated as the percentage of diseased spikelets per spike.
In the field experiments, the plant materials were planted in hill plots with 15 seeds per hill and a seeding spacing of 25 × 25 cm in a mist‐irrigated FHB nursery located at Fargo, North Dakota.
The evaluations were performed using spawn inoculation in 2018 (18F) and 2019 (19F).
Planting, inoculum preparation, and inoculation were performed as described by Chu et al. (2011) and Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018). The inoculum used in the experiments was prepared by inoculating autoclaved corn seeds with a mixture of spores from 20 differentF.
graminearumstrains.
As reported by Puri and Zhong (2010), the 20 strains used in the study were collected from the field in North Dakota and consisted of 10 producers of 3‐acetyl‐deoxynivalenol and 10 producers of 15‐acetyl‐deoxynivalenol.
During the boot stage of the earliest lines, theFusarium‐spoiled corn inoculum was evenly applied to all the plots at a rate of 35.6 g m−2.
Subsequently, the nursery was misted at 1‐h intervals for 2 min for 12 h per day (4:00 p.m.
to 4:00 a.m.), until approximately 14 days after the inoculation of the latest flowering genotypes.
The disease severity was recorded 19 days post anthesis as the percentage of infected spikelets on each head estimated based on the visual scale of 10 categories of infection (1 = 0, 2 = 7%, 3 = 14%, 4 = 21%, 5 = 33%, 6 = 50%, 7 = 66%, 8 = 75%, 9 = 90%, and 10 = 100%) described by Stack and McMullen (1998). The disease severity in each plot was calculated by computing the average severity of all heads, based on 10 scored spikes.
PH and FD data were collected in both field experiments (PH18 and PH19), and overall averages for PH (PHALL) and FD (FDALL) were calculated.
The measurement of PH was taken from the surface of the ground to the highest point of the spike while excluding the awns.
The FD was calculated starting from June 11 in 2018 and from June 25 in 2019, when about 50% of spikes in a hill were flowering.
Both PH and FD data were used to determine the correlation of these traits with FHB disease severity.
The software JMP Genomics 7 (SAS Institute) was utilized to compute descriptive statistics and to conduct a normality test for the distribution of disease severity, FD, and PH, using the Goodness of Fit option with the Shapiro–Wilk test as described by Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018). To examine the homogeneity of variances for disease severity, FD, and PH among the experiments, Levene's test was employed for data sets that exhibited a non‐normal distribution.
In contrast, Bartlett's test was utilized for data sets with normal distribution.
The tests were conducted under the general linear model (GLM) procedure using SAS Program version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
The least significant difference (LSD) values were calculated using the GLM procedure.
The correlation coefficients between disease severity and PH, as well as disease severity and FD, were computed using the PROC CORR procedure (SAS Institute).
The broad sense heritability across environments was estimated in accordance with Nyquist and Baker (1991) by applying the following formula:H2across environments = 1 − (MSG×E/MSG), where MSG×Eand MSGrepresent mean square genotype × environment and mean square genotype, respectively.
A population of 188 RILs was genotyped with Illumina 90K iSelect genotyping assay using Illumina's iSelect method following the manufacturer's protocols for processing and clustering (Illumina Inc.) (Sharma et al.,2021).
A total of 11,425 segregating single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were detected in the RIL population.
In addition, 22 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were polymorphic between ND495 and Largo and segregated in the RIL population.
Linkage analysis was conducted using the computer program MapDisto 2.1.7 (Heffelfinger et al.,2017).
A set of 11,447 markers was grouped using the command “Find linkage groups” with a logarithm of odds (LOD) > 3.0 and a maximum theta of 0.30.
The markers were further filtered by deleting redundant co‐segregating markers and markers with a missing data rate of 10% or higher.
To determine the best order of each group, the “Order a linkage group”, “Ripple order”, “Check inversions”, and “Drop locus” commands were used.
Markers with segregation distortion were filtered out.
Linkage distances were calculated using the Kosambi mapping function, as described by Kosambi (1943). The number of markers in the whole genome linkage map (TableS1) was reduced by leaving only one representative marker from each unique locus.
Error candidates and missing data were restored using the commands “Replace error candidates by flanking genotype” and “Replace missing data by flanking genotype,” respectively.
The final linkage map, consisting of 1698 markers, was used to conduct QTL analysis and prepare figures (TableS2).
QTL analysis was performed using the method described by Q. Zhang et al. (2014). Composite interval mapping was conducted using the software program QGene v.4.4.0 (Joehanes & Nelson,2008).
A 1000‐iteration permutation test was carried out, which determined a critical threshold of 3.3 at the 0.05 probability level.
TheR2andAdd effectfunctions in the program were used to calculate the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by a QTL and its additive effect, respectively.
QTLNetwork 2.1 program (J. Yang et al.,2005) was used to explore QTL × QTL interaction using multiple QTL mapping function.
To compare the differences in FHB resistance among different QTL haplotypes, the RILs with no missing allele information at the significant markers were grouped based on QTL alleles.
The mean differences in the FHB severities among the QTL haplotype groups were tested using the LSD procedure PROC GLM performed in SAS Program version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Box plots were created in JMP Genomics 7 (SAS Institute) using theGraph Builderfunction to graphically demonstrate the difference among QTL groups.
The significant 9K and 90K SNP markers at or near the peak regions of the identified FHB resistance QTL were converted to KASP markers (Table1).
The primer sequences of the KASP markers were obtained from the PolyMarker database (https://www.polymarker.info/designed_primers).
KASP markers were validated by genotyping the ND495/Largo population and a set of 25 SHW wheat lines showing a moderate or high level of FHB resistance (Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018) using the assay protocol as described in Nirmala et al. (2017) in the USDA‐ARS Small Grain Genotyping Laboratory, Fargo, ND.
Kompetitive allele‐specific PCR (KASP) markers designed using the significant single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions mapped in the population of the ND495/Largo recombinant inbred lines (RILs).
Note: Primer types: A1 (FAM) and A2 (HEX) are allele‐specific primers, and C is common primer.

The 188 RILs, their parents (ND495 and Largo), and two checks (Sumai 3 and Wheaton) were evaluated for FHB resistance in two greenhouse experiments (TablesS3andS4) and two field experiments (TablesS5andS6).
However, two lines (NL9 and NL130) were not evaluated due to late heading.
The Levene's test for FHB severity showed heterogeneity of error variances across two field and two greenhouse experiments (P< 0.0001,df= 3).
However, the data within experiments showed homogeneity (18F:p= 0.2383,df= 2; 19F:p= 0.4156,df= 2; 18GH:p= 0.3436,df= 2; 19GH:p= 0.1655,df= 2).
The evaluation data showed that the individual genotypes in the tested plant materials had variable expressions of FHB resistance in the experiments (Figure1).
The highest disease pressure was observed in the field in 2019 due to the warm and humid weather after plant heading.
The resistant and susceptible checks had the expected level of FHB resistance in all environments (Sumai 3: 3.0%–17.5%, and Wheaton: 69.0%–94.2%; Table2).
Largo (23.3%–52.3%) exhibited lower FHB severities than ND495 (40.0%–89.2%) across all four experiments, with the differences reaching statistical significance (p< 0.05) in three of the experiments: 19F, 18GH, and 19GH (Table2; Figure1).
The heritability (H2) values for FHB severity were high (0.72, 0.89, and 0.75) for field experiments, greenhouse experiments, and combined data from all four experiments, respectively (Table2), indicating good reproducibility of FHB severity data among the experiments.

Data set: 18F and 19F are FHB severity data from field experiments in 2018 and 2019, respectively; 18GH and 19GH are FHB severity data from greenhouse experiments in 2018 and 2019, respectively; FHBF and FHBGH are combined FHB severity data from field and greenhouse data, respectively.
FHBALL is combined FHB severity data of all FHB experiments (18F, 19F, 18GH, and 19GH); PH18 and PH19 are plant height data from field experiments in 2018 and 2019, respectively, PHALL is combined plant height data of the field experiments in 2018 and 2019, respectively; FD18 and FD19 are flowering date data from field experiments calculated starting from June 11 in 2018 and June 25 in 2019, respectively; FDALL is combined flowering date data from the field experiments in 2018 and 2019.
Bartlett's test for PH showed homogeneity across the two field seasons and within experiments as well (PH18:χ2df = 2= 0.79,p= 0.6742; PH19:χ2df = 2= 0.97,p= 0.6170; PHALL:χ2df = 1= 1.81,p= 0.1786).
PH showed a wide variation among RILs, ranging from 58.8 to 120.0 cm (Table2).
Levene's test indicated significant heterogeneity in FD data both among experiments (p< 0.0001) and within the FD19 experiment (p= 0.0038), whereas the data within FD18 were homogeneous (p= 0.3339).
In FD18, Pearson's correlation coefficients between FHB severity and PH or FD were −0.012 and 0.089, respectively, and were not statistically significant (p= 0.8756 andp= 0.2239, respectively; Table3).
In FD19, weak but statistically significant negative correlations were observed between FHB severity and PH (r= −0.198;p= 0.0065), as well as between FHB severity and FD (r= −0.250;p= 0.0006).
These results indicate that PH and FD did not significantly affect FHB severity in 2018, whereas in 2019 shorter plants and/or early flowering plants had higher disease severity.

A total of 1682 SNP and 16 SSR markers that segregated among the RILs were used to construct a genetic linkage map, covering a genetic length of 2406.1 cM with an average marker density of 1.4 cM per marker.
Maps for the A, B, and D genomes spanned 845.7, 706.5, and 853.9 cM with an average density of 1.4, 1.1, and 1.8 cM per marker, respectively (TableS7).
Chromosome 4D was the shortest (69.1 cM), and chromosome 5A was the longest (156.4 cM) in the linkage map.
The number of markers per chromosome varied from 21 (4D) to 160 (5A), and marker densities varied from 0.87 cM per marker on chromosome 7B to 3.29 cM per marker on chromosome 4D.
The homogeneity tests showed that the error variances across the two field and two greenhouse experiments were not homogenous.
Therefore, the FHB severity data from the four environments (18F, 19F, 18GH, and 19GH) were analyzed separately for QTL detection.
A total of six QTL were associated with FHB resistance (Figure2; Table4).
Among these QTL, three were located on chromosomes 1D, 2D, and 5B and designatedQFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐2D, andQFhb.rwg‐5B, respectively.
Three other QTL were all located on chromosome 7D, and they are designated asQFhb.rwg‐7D.1,QFhb.rwg‐7D.2, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3, respectively.
Among these QTL,QFhb.rwg‐2D, which was derived from the susceptible parent ND495, was the only QTL detected in all four experiments (18F, 19F, 18GH, and 19GH).QFhb.rwg‐2Dhad the largest additive effect (−6.99, −4.48, −11.12, and −8.17, respectively), with LOD values of 5.64, 3.32, 9.93, and 6.39, and it explained 13%, 8%, 22%, and 15% of the phenotypic variation in 18F, 19F, 18GH, and 19GH, respectively (Figure2; Table4).
With 18GH and 19GH data,QFhb.rwg‐2Dpeaked in a 7.2‐cM chromosome interval betweenIWA4789andIWB484at the physical position between 75.2 and 82.4 cM (481.6 and 533.1 Mb).
With the 18F and 19F data, this QTL showed the highest LOD value at markerIWB18804at position 83.5 cM (538.7 Mb).

The 7D QTLQFhb.rwg‐7D.2, which was also contributed by ND495, was detected in both greenhouse experiments.
This 7D QTL had the second largest additive effects (−9.21 in 18GH and −7.74 in 19GH), with LOD values of 7.11 (18GH) and 5.79 (19GH), and it explained 16% (18GH) and 14% (19GH) of the phenotypic variance.
It peaked in a 6.3‐cM interval betweenIWA8486andIWB14320at position 64.3–71.7 cM (Figure2; Table4).
Contrary to the two QTL described above (QFhb.rwg‐2DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.2), the resistant allele at the other four QTL (QFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐5B,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) were all derived from the resistant parent Largo, but they were detected only in single environments.QFhb.rwg‐1D, QFhb.rwg‐5B, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3were detected in the field environment in 2019 (19F) and explained 11%, 10%, and 8% of the phenotypic variation, respectively.QFhb.rwg‐7D.1was detected in the field environment in 2018 (18F) and explained 9% of the phenotypic variation.QFhb.rwg‐1Dpeaked in a 3.2‐cM interval betweenIWB17549andIWB6869at position 45.4–48.6 cM in the centromere region on chromosome 1D (Figure2; Table4).QFhb.rwg‐5B, located on the long arm of chromosome 5B, had the highest LOD value at markerIWB52117at position 77.8 cM (Figure2; Table4).
The QTLQFhb.rwg‐7D.1peaked at markerIWB15280at the 42.2 cM position on the short arm of chromosome 7D, whereasQFhb.rwg‐7D.3was mapped at markerIWB8024at position 88.2 cM on the long arm of the same chromosome (Figure2; Table4).
The significant effects ofQFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐2D, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.2were confirmed using the QTLNetwork program.
However, the markers at the other three QTL (QFhb.rwg‐5B,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) that showed only minor association with FHB resistance using the program QGene v.4.4.0 did not reach the significant level when data were analyzed with QTLNetwork program.
The results also showed that no epistatic interactions were detected among the three QTLsQFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐2D, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.2.
Among 188 RILs, 165 had no missing allele information at the significant markers, and they were grouped based on their QTL haplotypes.
The QTL groups on the box plot diagrams were represented by markers with the highest LOD value:IWB6869,IWB484,IWB52117,IWB15280,IWB14320, andIWB8024forQFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐2D,QFhb.rwg‐5B,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1,QFhb.rwg‐7D.2, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3, respectively.
Box plot graphs comparing QTL groups across environments (FigureS1and Figure3) reflected the distribution of FHB severity shown in the histograms in Figure1.
The differences among the QTL groups were smaller in the 18F and 19F data sets than those in the 18GH, 19GH, and overall average data set (FigureS1and Figure3).
As expected, the groups carrying 4–6 QTL generally had lower FHB severities (average: 53.4%, range 43.0%–74.7%) than those having 0–3 QTL (average: 64.3%, range 51.4%–72.4%); the groups carrying the two main QTL, namely,QFhb.rwg‐2DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.2from ND495, had lower FHB severities (average: 49.8%, range 43.0%–54.7%) than those without the two QTL (average: 70.4%, range 61.7%–74.7%) (FigureS1and Figure3).
Box plot diagram of average Fusarium head blight (FHB) severities among the quantitative trait loci (QTL) groups in the ND495 × Largo population tested in two greenhouse seasons and two field experiments in 2018 and 2019.
The means with the same letters on the top of the whiskers did not differ significantly (α< 0.05) as determined by least significant difference (LSD).
Although the QTL from Largo had less effect on FHB severity, they clearly played an important role in enhancing FHB resistance.
For instance, among the groups carrying one main QTL from ND495, the groups carrying 2–4 QTL from Largo had lower FHB severities (range 49.7%–58.8%) than those with 0–1 Largo QTL (range 65.5%–71.1%) (FigureS1and Figure3).
From this analysis, we also observed that the average disease severity of the QTL group carrying all six resistance alleles (48.9%) was slightly higher than the group carrying two resistance alleles from each parent (43.0%) (FigureS1and Figure3).
Meanwhile, the group carrying all four QTL from Largo had the highest FHB severity (74.7%).
These discrepancies are likely caused by the differences in the number of lines and/or genetic backgrounds.
The markers at the three minor QTL (QFhb.rwg‐5B,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) aligned with the Chinese Spring reference genome v2.1 at genesTraesCS5B03G1216000,TraesCS7D03G0166600, andTraesCS7D03G0942700.
The functions of these genes were described as unknown or likely non‐disease resistance related.
The sequence of markerIWB17549atQFhb.rwg‐1Ddid not give significant alignment on chromosome 1D using the Chinese Spring reference genome v2.1.
Although 845 genes were identified in the 76,868,328 bp–252,729,664 bp region using the flanking markerIWB49565, only seven of them encode nucleotide‐binding site leucine‐rich repeat (NBS‐LRR) proteins.
Out of the seven genes, two (TraesCS1D03G0448900andTraesCS1D03G0449300) were within 1–2 Mb distance from the significant markerIWB6859(252,729,563–252,729,664 bp) (TableS8).
A total of 476 genes were identified in theQFhb.rwg‐2Dregion between the significant markersIWA4789andIWB18804(483,825,998–541,262,766 bp), six of which have NBS‐LRR functions (TableS9).
No gene was found with NBS‐LRR function out of the 226 genes identified in theQFhb.rwg‐7D.2region (TableS10).
In addition to the high‐confidence genes mentioned above, 1644, 507, and 264 low‐confidence genes were identified in theQFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐2D, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.2regions, respectively, including 7, 1, and 3 NBS‐LRR genes (TablesS8–S10).
Ten KASP markers were developed to track the six FHB resistance QTL identified in the ND495/Largo RIL population (Table1).
The KASP markers were validated in the ND495/Largo RIL population and in a set of 25 SHW lines with moderate and high levels of FHB resistance (FigureS2).
The marker allele information of ND495/Largo RIL population and 25 SHW lines, along with their FHB severities from Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018), were shown in TablesS11andS12, respectively.
The results demonstrated that the marker alleles of the 10 KASP markers in the ND495/Largo RIL population were highly consistent with those of 9K or 90K SNP markers (TableS11).
The similarity between 9K/90K SNPs and their respective KASP markers was 96.7% for three markers (KASP‐IWB6869‐1DandKASP‐IWA4789‐2D, andKASP‐IWB52117‐5B), 97.3% for four markers (KASP‐IWB57869‐2D,KASP‐IWB15280‐7D,KASP‐IWB14320‐7D, andKASP‐IWB8024‐7D), 97.8% for two markers (KASP‐IWB17549‐1D,KASP‐IWA8486‐7D), and 98.9% for one marker (KASP‐IWB484‐2D), suggesting that these KASP markers could be useful in marker‐assisted selection.
All the resistant SHW lines reported by Szabo‐Hever et al. (2018) have the resistance alleles of two KASP markers (KASP‐IWB17549‐1DandKASP‐IWB6869‐1D) forQFhb.rwg‐1Dand one marker (KASP‐IWB8024‐7D) forQFhb.rwg‐7D.3(TableS12).
Interestingly, only 40% of the SHW lines carried the resistance alleles of the markers (KASP‐IWB52117‐5BandKASP‐IWB15280‐7D) forQFhb.rwg‐5BandQFhb.rwg‐7D.1.
Except for one SHW line, SW187 (pedigree:T. dicoccumPI 272527/Ae.tauschiiCIae 26), all other SHW lines withAe.tauschiiClae 26 in their pedigrees had the resistance allele of the markerFHB‐IWB484‐2DatQFhb.rwg‐2Dregion.
All SHW lines withAe.tauschiiaccessions RL 5286 and PI 268210 in their pedigrees had the resistance allele of the markerFHB‐IWB15280‐7D.1atQFhb.rwg‐7D.1region.
Also, the two SHW lines SW92 and SW188, havingAe.tauschiiRL 5286 in their pedigree, carried resistance allele of markerFHB‐IWA8486‐7DatQFhb.rwg‐7D.2region.
In modern wheat germplasm improvement, the development of SHW germplasm is a useful approach for introducing novel genes and alleles fromAe.
tauschiiand tetraploid wheat germplasm into common wheat.
In this aspect, the development and utilization of SHW line Largo for breeding greenbug resistance represents one of the pioneering and successful breeding practices.
Largo was developed in the late 1970s and released as germplasm carryingGb3for resistance to greenbug biotype E (Joppa & Williams,1982; Joppa et al.,1980).
From 1980 to 1984, Largo was used as the source ofGb3for the development of the winter wheat variety TAM 110 (pedigree: ‘TAM 105′*4/Amigo*5//Largo) in Texas (Lazar et al.,1997).
TAM 110 was further used as the source ofGb3for other most widely grown varieties in the state, such as TAM 112 (Rudd et al.,2014) and TAM 204 (Rudd et al.,2019).
Recently, Largo'sAe.
tauschiiparent, PI 268210 (TA 1618), was reported to contribute the geneCmcTAM112for resistance to wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichellaKeifer), a vector for wheat streak mosaic virus (genusTritimovirus) (Dhakal et al.,2018; Gaurav et al.,2022).
In addition to resistance to greenbug and curl mite, Largo was also found to have resistance to several other important wheat diseases (Adhikari et al.,2015; Friesen et al.,2008; Sharma et al.,2021; Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
By using the ND495/Largo RIL population, Adhikari et al. (2015) detected four QTL for resistance to septoria tritici blotch, caused byZymoseptoria tritici(Desm.)
Quaedvlieg and Crous (syn:Mycosphaerella graminicola(Fuckel) Schrot).
Sharma et al. (2021) identified six stem rust resistance genes, with two being potentially novel genes or alleles.
In the present study, we identified four Largo‐derived FHB resistance QTL, further demonstrating that Largo is a valuable SHW germplasm for wheat improvement.
Although a number of SHW lines were previously reported to have resistance to FHB (Das et al.,2016; Oliver et al.,2005; Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018; Zhu et al.,2016), molecular mapping of FHB resistance in SHW germplasm has not previously been reported.
Therefore, this study may represent the first effort to dissect FHB resistance in synthetic wheat germplasm.
Among the six FHB resistance QTL identified in this study,QFhb.rwg‐1Dwas mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 1D and derived from the resistant parent Largo.
Based on its location,QFhb.rwg‐1Dshould be different from the QTL previously mapped to the distal end of chromosome arm 1DS in common wheat (Ittu et al.,2000; Klahr et al.,2007; Liu et al.,2013; Lu et al.,2013; Z. Yang et al.,2005).
Islam et al. (2016) identified a QTL in the centromeric region of chromosome 1D from the winter wheat variety Truman that has excellent FHB resistance.
Petersen et al. (2016) detected a QTL near the centromeric region of chromosome 1D from the susceptible wheat variety AGS 2000 in a RIL population.
Although these QTL may coincide,QFhb.rwg‐1Dfrom Largo and the 1D QTL from Truman and AGS 2000 are likely different.
First,QFhb.rwg‐1Dwas identified from a resistant parent based on FHB disease severity, and although the 1D QTL from Truman was also identified from a resistant parent, it was only associated with reduced incidence (Islam et al.,2016).
Second, the 1D QTL from AGS 2000 was identified from a susceptible parent, and it was only associated with decreased FDK and DON (Petersen et al.,2016).
The QTLQFhb.rwg‐2Doriginated from ND495, and it was mapped in the proximal region (close to the centromere) of chromosome arm 2DL.
Another FHB resistance QTL (QFhs.crc‐2DL) in this chromosome region was first identified in the Chinese wheat variety Wuhan 1 (Somers et al.,2003).
Thereafter, a major and stable FHB resistance QTL has been detected in this chromosomal region in many wheat varieties and lines, including Chinese wheat landrace Wangshuibai (Lin et al.,2006) and line CJ 9306 (Jiang, Dong, et al.,2007; Jiang, Shi, et al.,2007), Chinese wheat variety Ji5265 (H. Li et al.,2022), US soft red winter wheat breeding line VA00W‐38 (Liu et al.,2012), CIMMYT wheat line Shanghai‐3/Catbird (Lu et al.,2013), SHW derived lines Soru#1 (He et al.,2016) and C615 (Yi et al.,2018), and Canadian spring wheat varieties Kenyon (McCartney et al.,2016), AAC Tenacious (Dhariwal et al.,2020), AC Barrie (Thambugala et al.,2020), and the elite Chinese wheat cultivar Yangmai 158 (Yan et al.,2021).
The three QTL identified based on SSR markers in Wuhan 1, CJ 9306, and Shanghai‐3/Catbird all linked to SSR markergwm539(Jiang, Dong, et al.,2007; Jiang, Shi, et al.,2007; Lu et al.,2013; Somers et al.,2003).
The 2DL QTL identified in Soru#1 (He et al.,2016) using 90K SNP and SSR markers was mapped within the marker intervalgwm539‐‐IWB44589(Kukri_c36639_186), which corresponds to the physical interval of 513–574 Mb on chromosome arm 2DL in the Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.0 sequence (IWGSC,2018; Zheng et al.,2021).
F. Zhang et al. (2024) recently identified that the 2DL QTL derived from a Chinese wheat variety, Shi4185 is the same QTL asQFhb‐2DLin Ji5265 and designated the QTL asFhb9.
They mappedFhb9to an 8.0 Mb (525.9–533.8 Mb) interval.
BecauseQFhb.rwg‐2Dpeaked at the marker intervalIWA4789–IWB18804, which corresponds to the physical interval of 481.6–538.7 Mb (IWGSC,2018; Zheng et al.,2021), it physically overlapped or co‐localized with theFhb9or 2DL QTL identified in the wheat varieties or lines described above.
Therefore,QFhb.rwg‐2Dis likely the same asFhb9, present in many wheat varieties on chromosome 2D.
However, becauseQFhb.rwg‐2Dis derived from the susceptible parent and has not been fine mapped, we could not rule out the possibility thatQFhb.rwg‐2Dis a QTL closely linked toFhb9in this region.
TheQFhb.rwg‐5Bfrom Largo is located on the long arm of chromosome 5B.
Several FHB resistance QTL have been reported on chromosome arm 5BL (see reviewed by H. Buerstmayr et al.,2009; Liu et al.,2009; Petersen et al.,2016; R. Wang et al.,2017; Zheng et al.,2021).
Based on 30 original QTL in previous studies and meta‐QTL analysis, Zheng et al. (2021) identified six sequence‐based high‐confidence mQTL (smQTL), namedsMQTL‐5B‐2throughsMQTL‐5B‐7, on chromosome arm 5BL.QFhb.rwg‐5Bis physically located within the interval of 666.2–669.6 Mb between markersIWB71749andIWB62048on chromosome 5B in the Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.0.sequence (IWGSC,2018; Zheng et al.,2021), and it is positioned betweensMQTL‐5B‐6(610–623 Mb) andsMQTL‐5B‐7(679–680 Mb) (Zheng et al.,2021).
SinceQFhb.rwg‐5Bdoes not physically overlap with any of the six smQTL, it is likely a different QTL.
However, because of the close proximity, we cannot rule out the possibility thatQFhb.rwg‐5Bis the same QTL assMQTL‐5B‐7 or any of its five original QTL identified in the wheat variety Patterson (Bourdoncle & Ohm,2003), Georgian spelt wheat (T.macha), and the Canadian spring wheat variety Kenyon (McCartney et al.,2016).
In addition, Ghavami et al. (2011) identified a QTL (Qfhs.ndsu‐5BL) on chromosome arm 5BL in durum wheat.
Given thatQFhb.rwg‐5Bin Largo also originated from durum (Langdon), it was theorized thatQFhb.rwg‐5Bmay be the same QTL asQfhs.ndsu‐5BL, but comparing the positions of the two QTL in the Svevo reference genome v1.0 (Maccaferri et al.,2019),Qfhs.ndsu‐5BLis likely about 20–35 Mb more distal fromQFhb.rwg‐5B.
Three FHB resistance QTL (QFhb.rwg‐7D.1,QFhb.rwg‐7D.2, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) were identified on chromosome 7D, with one having a large effect (QFhb.rwg‐7D.2) and two having minor effects (QFhb.rwg‐7D.1andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) derived from ND495 and Largo, respectively.
Several FHB resistance QTL were previously mapped onto chromosome 7D in different bread wheat materials, including recently designatedFhb8(Qfdk.nau‐7D) for reducing Fusarium‐damaged kernels (FDK) identified in Wangshuibai (X. Wang et al.,2024).
By using meta‐QTL and sequence analysis, Zheng et al. (2021) consolidated 17 QTL from chromosome 7D into four smQTL:sMQTL‐7D‐1(90–102 Mb),sMQTL‐7D‐2(124–144 Mb),sMQTL‐7D‐3(168–194 Mb), andsMQTL‐7D‐4(506–518 Mb), which consist of two, five, three, and seven original QTL, respectively.
In the Chinese Spring reference genome v1.0, the two significant markersIWA8486(117.8 Mb) andIWB14320(146.1 Mb) forQFhb.rwg‐7D.2span an interval covering thesMQTL‐7D‐2(124–144 Mb) region, indicating thatQFhb.rwg‐7D.2is likely the same QTL as those mapped to thesMQTL‐7D‐2region close to the centromeric region of chromosome arm 7DS in Wangshuibai (Jia et al.,2005; C. Li et al.,2008), Riband (Draeger et al.,2007), Haiyanzhong (Cai et al.,2016; T. Li et al.,2011), Catbird (Cativelli et al.,2013), Kenyon (McCartney et al.,2016), and several breeding lines (Eckard et al.,2015).
TheQFhb.rwg‐7D.1on 7DS is situated about 20 cM distal toQFhb.rwg‐7D.2.
The significant markerIWB15280forQFhb.rwg‐7D.1was physically located at 42.5 Mb and flanked by markersIWB18267(40.3 Mb) andIWB16984(43.0 Mb) (Chinese Spring reference genome v1.0).
This region has not been previously shown to be associated with FHB resistance, except for the two QTL that were previously mapped about 15 cM proximal and distal toQFhb.rwg‐7D.1(T. Li et al.,2011; Ren et al.,2019; Szabo‐Hever et al.,2014), suggesting thatQFhb.rwg‐7D.1may be a novel QTL.
The significant markerIWB8024(516.0 Mb) forQFhb.rwg‐7D.3on 7DL was flanked byIWB16157andIWB16883in an interval of 503.7–526.4 Mb (Chinese Spring reference genome v1.0), which coincides with thesMQTL‐7D‐4(506–518 Mb) region, indicating thatQFhb.rwg‐7D.3might be the same QTL as those mapped to thesMQTL‐7D‐4region.
In addition, Buerstmayr and Buerstmayr (2015) mapped an FHB resistance QTL in Capo on the long arm of chromosome 7D that was in close proximity toQFhb.rwg‐7D.3.
These two QTL cannot be directly compared due to the absence lack of common markers between the two maps, but indirect comparison by previously published map data indicates that they are likely the same (Blake et al.,2019; Ren et al.,2019).
Among the six QTL, four (QFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐5B,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) were derived from the resistant parent Largo, and two (QFhb.rwg‐2DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.2) were derived from the susceptible parent ND495.
In bi‐parent populations, FHB resistance QTL are usually identified from the resistant parents.
However, they are also frequently identified from susceptible parents; for example, resistance QTL have been reported on chromosome 2A in the susceptible durum varieties Ben (Q. Zhang et al.,2014) and Joppa (Zhao et al.,2018), on chromosome 1B in the winter wheat variety Lynx (Schmolke et al.,2005), and on chromosome 3A in the spring wheat variety AC Foremost.
Susceptibility in wheat genotypes carrying FHB‐resistance QTL can be caused by suppressors or epistatic susceptibility genes.
G. Li et al. (2023) recently identified two suppressors,In1andIn2, which inhibitFhb1‐mediated resistance to FHB.
In a survey of 1601 wheat accessions, G. Li et al. (2023) found thatIn1andIn2are commonly present in over 50% of the accessions worldwide.
Specifically, G. Li et al. (2023) reported that 66% of 100 varieties and lines from North and South America, including 42 from the United States, carry at least one of these suppressors.
Given their widespread distribution,In1and/orIn2could possibly be present in ND495; however, this remains to be investigated.
Moreover, it is currently unclear whetherIn1andIn2can suppress FHB resistance conferred by genes or QTL other thanFhb1.
Several studies have shown that the susceptible factors are commonly present in both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat on chromosome arms 7AS, 3DL, and 4DS (Chhabra et al.,2021; Fabre et al.,2020; Garvin et al.,2015; Hales et al.,2020; Ma et al.,2006).
Garvin et al. (2015) and Hales et al. (2020) demonstrated that deletion of the factors on chromosome arms 3DL and 7AS increased FHB resistance.
Su et al. (2019) demonstrated that a histidine‐rich calcium‐binding protein gene (TaHRC), which was identified as the causal gene forFhb1, is an FHB‐susceptible factor.
TheFhb1‐mediated FHB resistance extensively used in wheat breeding and production in fact resulted from natural mutation caused by a large deletion in the second intron and the beginning of the third exon of theTaHRCsusceptible allele.
Su et al. (2019) and Chen, Su, Tian, Hao et al. (2022), Chen, Su, Tian, Liu, et al. (2022) showed that knockout of theTaHRCsusceptible allele in the FHB‐susceptible variety Bobwhite through gene editing improved FHB resistance.
In the present study, the two QTL (QFhb.rwg‐2DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.2) from the susceptible parent ND495 had larger resistance effects than the four QTL from the resistance parent Largo, suggesting that ND495 might possess suppressor(s) or susceptibility gene(s) that may suppress or mask resistance controlled by the resistance QTL.
In the bi‐parental segregating population, the FHB resistance QTL derived from the susceptible parent ND495 may have been separated from their suppressor(s) or susceptibility factors in a subset of genotypes due to independent assortment and recombination, thereby enabling the expression of the resistance QTL contributed by the susceptible parent.
In our study, no significant epistatic effect was discovered between the QTL identified in Largo and ND495.
Therefore, further research may be necessary to discover additional QTL or genes associated with FHB resistance or susceptibility.
FHB resistance in wheat has been shown to share pleiotropic loci with several morphological traits, including PH, heading or FD, spike morphology, and anther retention/extrusion (Akohoue et al.,2022; Buerstmayr et al.,2020).
Consequently, it is possible for QTL mapping studies targeting FHB resistance to identify loci associated with traits other than FHB resistance per se.
In the present study, we posit that the QTL on chromosomes 2D and 7D, identified from the susceptible parent ND495, are unlikely to be associated with PH or FD, given the absence or very low correlations between FHB severity and these traits in the two field experiments.
However, the potential association of these QTL with spike morphology or anther retention/extrusion remains unclear, as these traits were not assessed in this study.
It is notable that all four minor QTL identified from Largo were detected exclusively in a single field environment and were not observed in the greenhouse experiments.
Unlike greenhouse assays, which primarily evaluate Type II resistance (resistance to fungal spread within the spike), field experiments can capture both Type I resistance (resistance to initial infection) and Type II resistance.
Therefore, it is possible that some of the minor QTL detected only under field conditions are specifically associated with Type I resistance.
The lack of repeatability of these QTL across the two field environments may be attributed to differing weather conditions, as we observed that disease pressure was considerably higher in 2019 compared to 2018 (Figure1; Table2), likely due to excessive rainfall in 2019.
Given the inherent complexity and variability of field experiments, these minor QTL require further validation in future studies.
In summary, Largo (Langdon ×Ae.tauschiiPI 268210) was identified to possess a moderate to high level of FHB resistance in our previous experiments (Szabo‐Hever et al.,2018).
In the current study, we detected three (QFhb.rwg‐1D,QFhb.rwg‐7D.1, andQFhb.rwg‐7D.3) and one (QFhb.rwg‐5B) QTL originating fromAe.tauschiiPI 268210 and Langdon, respectively, withQFhb.rwg‐1DandQFhb.rwg‐7D.1likely being novel QTL.
Therefore, FHB resistance in Largo is confirmed to result from the mutual action of the four minor QTL.
An unexpected discovery was the identification of two QTL with larger effects on chromosomes 2D (QFhb.rwg‐2D) and 7D (QFhb.rwg‐7D.2) from ND495.
Furthermore,QFhb.rwg‐2D, which had the largest effect, is believed to be the major FHB resistance 2D QTL orFhb9found in various wheat varieties and lines.
Since no major FHB resistance QTL was previously detected on chromosome 2D in hard red spring wheat germplasm adapted to the spring wheat region in the U.S., the identification ofQFhb.rwg‐2Din ND495 will facilitate its integration into breeding programs for hard red spring wheat.
Moreover, identifying these QTL in both the resistant and susceptible parents suggests that the optimal strategy for enhancing FHB resistance is to combine multiple resistance QTL while simultaneously eliminating susceptibility genes using the KASP markers developed and validated in this study.
