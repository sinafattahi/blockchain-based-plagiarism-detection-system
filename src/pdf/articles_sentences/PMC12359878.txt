Salinity is an abiotic stress that negatively affects plant growth and the synthesis of secondary metabolites.
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of foliar applications of titanium (Ti) and nano-titanium (nano-Ti) at concentrations of 0, 50, and 100 mg/L under salinity levels of 0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl in controlled greenhouse conditions.
A factorial experiment based on a completely randomized design with four replications was conducted.
A comprehensive set of morphological (plant height, fresh and dry biomass), physiological (photosynthetic pigments, soluble carbohydrates, proline, and protein content), and biochemical parameters (antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase), as well as essential oil (EO) content and composition, were assessed.
Salinity stress markedly reduced plant growth, chlorophyll content, and EO yield, while increasing oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).
The application of 100 mg/L nano-titanium under non-stress conditions significantly increased plant height (47.01 cm), fresh weight (87.33 g), and essential oil yield (0.639 g/pot).
Moreover, essential oil content reached a maximum of 1.84% under 50 mM salinity with 100 mg/L nano-titanium, representing a 212% increase compared to the control.
Nano-titanium application under salinity stress increased APX and SOD activities by 176% and 237%, respectively, compared to the control.
GC–MS analysis revealed linalool, trans-caryophyllene, 1,8-cineole, and germacrene D as the major EO constituents, whose concentrations were notably influenced by both salinity level and Ti treatments.
These findings suggest that nano-Ti has the potential to be used as a sustainable biostimulant to enhance growth and secondary metabolite production inM.×gracilisunder saline environments.
Medicinal plants have long been valued for their therapeutic properties, playing a vital role in both traditional and modern healthcare systems.
Their bioactive constituents, including essential oils, alkaloids, and flavonoids, contribute to the treatment and prevention of a wide range of human diseases [1], in addition to their therapeutic applications in healthcare systems, they have also gained attention in agriculture as natural and effective alternatives to chemical materials [2,3].
The increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses and a growing demand for natural and sustainable remedies have further emphasized the importance of identifying and cultivating high-quality medicinal plants with enhanced therapeutic value [4–6].
The genusMenthafrom the Lamiaceae family contains compounds with interesting pharmacological and therapeutic properties [7].
Among these,Mentha×gracilis, commonly known as ginger mint, has attracted attention due to its aromatic essential oil and pharmacological applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries [7–10].
However, medicinal plants, like other crops, are vulnerable to environmental stressors, particularly salinity, which is one of the most critical abiotic stresses affecting plant growth, metabolism, and yield worldwide [11–13].
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about 20% of cultivated land and 33% of irrigated land worldwide are affected by salinity, threatening global food security [14].
Salinity leads to osmotic imbalance and oxidative stress, negatively impacting photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and secondary metabolite production [15–17].
While moderate stress may stimulate the accumulation of valuable phytochemicals, excessive salt levels can impair plant performance and reduce the quantity and quality of essential oils [18,19].
This dual effect necessitates the development of strategies to enhance plant tolerance to salinity while preserving or improving their phytochemical composition.Mentha×gracilisis primarily found in temperate and humid regions, particularly in parts of Europe and Asia, where it grows naturally; however, due to its unique phytochemical properties, it has been widely cultivated across the globe, including in semi-subtropical regions of Iran such as East Azerbaijan, Kermanshah, and Fars [20,21].
Similar to salinity, drought stress has been shown to reduce plant biomass while enhancing essential oil content and the accumulation of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in medicinal plants such as Salvia officinalis, highlighting the general impact of abiotic stresses on secondary metabolism [22,23].
Previous studies have shown that improving soil or foliar inputs under salinity stress—whether through organic amendments or molecular priming—can significantly enhance plant physiological and secondary metabolite responses, including the accumulation of phenolics and improved antioxidant capacity, especially in aromatic and medicinal species [24,25].
Foliar application of bioactive compounds has been demonstrated to alleviate the negative effects of drought stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities and essential oil biosynthesis, suggesting a potential parallel with the effects of nano-titanium under salinity conditions [22,23,25–30].
Recent studies have demonstrated that eco-friendly nanomaterials, particularly the application of metal oxide nanoparticles can significantly improve plant stress tolerance [31–34].
These responses vary depending on the plant species, the form of titanium, the properties of the nanoparticle at the nanoscale, its concentration, and the method of application [15,35–37].
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO₂) are among the most widely used nanomaterials in modern industries, including agriculture, due to their high chemical stability, strong photocatalytic activity, and low cost.
TiO₂ exists in three primary crystalline forms—anatase, rutile, and brookite—with anatase being the most active and commonly used form in plant-related applications [38].
As a semiconductor nanomaterial, nano-TiO₂ has gained attention for its ability to interact with light and biological systems, making it a valuable input in the formulation of antimicrobial agents, fungicides, and agricultural bio-stimulants [39].
Although titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO₂ NPs) can enhance plant growth traits at low concentrations, they may exhibit phytotoxic effects at higher doses; therefore, selecting an appropriate dosage is essential to avoid plant damage [40].
Recent studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of nano-TiO₂ on plant growth, photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, enzymatic activity, and essential oil production [15,41,42].
Several studies have reported that nano-TiO₂ application improves germination rate, biomass accumulation, and enzymatic antioxidant activity in crops such as fennel, rosemary, basil, and spinach under both normal and stress [15,43].
Recent studies have confirmed the positive effects of nanomaterials such as titanium dioxide, cerium oxide, and iron oxide nanoparticles on improving salt stress tolerance in mint species.
These treatments enhanced plant growth, photosynthetic pigments, antioxidant activities, and essential oil yield and composition under salinity conditions [26,44,45].
Although some investigations have explored the role of nano-titanium in enhancing plant growth and essential oil yield under stress conditions, there is a lack of specific research focusing onMentha×gracilis.
Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the impact of various forms and concentrations of titanium, including nano-titanium, on the morphological, physiological, and phytochemical traits ofMentha×gracilisunder salinity stress, with a particular focus on essential oil composition and production.

Furthermore, this treatment led to a 28% increase in proline compared to the no-fertilizer treatment under 50 mM salinity (Fig.8).
According to results, soluble protein content was significantly influenced by salinity stress and fertilizer treatments.
Among fertilizer treatments, the highest protein content (1.79 mg g⁻1fresh weight) was obtained with the application of 100 mg nano-titanium, while the lowest (1.35 mg g⁻1fresh weight) was observed in the no-fertilizer control (Fig.9).

Also, under non-stressed conditions, the application of 100 mg of nano-titanium resulted in a 211% increase in essential oil yield compared to 100 mM salinity stress without fertilizer (Fig.13).
Analysis of ginger mint essential oil identified 22 compounds, which accounted for 90.2% to 98.24% of the total composition (Table7).
Among the essential oil compounds, linalool (21.6% to 46.49%), trans-caryophyllene (6.82% to 17.99%), 1,8-cineole (5.75% to 12.47%), germacrene D (4.28% to 10.42%), gamma-terpinene (5.01% to 9.98%), β-pinene (2.97% to 9.39%), thymol (4.77% to 6.52%), and n-decane (1.31% to 6.16%) were the major components.
Furthermore, the highest amount of linalool was obtained using 50 mg of nano-titanium under non-stressed conditions, while the highest levels of trans-caryophyllene, 1,8-cineole, and germacrene D were found under severe salinity stress with the application of 100 mg of nano-titanium.
The highest amounts of gamma-terpinene and β-pinene were observed under severe salinity stress with 50 mg of titanium, while the maximum levels of thymol and n-decane were recorded under mild salinity stress with 100 mg of nano-titanium.
The present study revealed that salinity stress significantly affects the growth and height ofMentha spicata.
High salinity levels alter soil structure and reduce nutrient availability, leading to ion toxicity that impairs water uptake and reduces osmotic potential.
This leads to reduced growth of both root and shoot systems [55].
Additionally, salinity stress suppresses cell division and induces programmed cell death, further reducing plant height [56,57].
Our findings, showed that the application of TiO₂ nanoparticles significantly improved plant height under both saline and non-saline conditions.
Ti nanoparticles were found to enhance root development, regulate transpiration, and boost chlorophyll biosynthesis, which in turn promoted vegetative growth [42,55].
TiO₂ nanoparticles enhance plant growth through multiple mechanisms.
They improve nutrient uptake by interacting with root cells and activating transport and signaling pathways [58–60].
TiO₂ nanoparticles also stimulate chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis efficiency [61,62], which enhanced photosynthesis is proposed to result from titanium’s ability to stimulate the electron transport rate within chloroplasts, potentially by enhancing the Hill reaction (Hong et al., 2005), while reducing oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities such as SOD and APX (Machanu, et al. 2024).
These combined effects support root development, regulate transpiration, and promote vegetative growth under both normal and stress conditions.
Previous studies support these results, with Waani et al. [57] demonstrating that TiO₂ nanoparticles (500 mg kg⁻1) increased plant height in rice[57], and Sheikhalipour et al. [35] showing that 20 mg L⁻1of TiO₂ nanoparticles improved shoot and root growth inStevia rebaudianaunder saline conditions.
In addition to growth enhancement, salinity stress also reduced both fresh and dry biomass inMentha x gracilis, as elevated salinity increased osmotic pressure and induced ionic toxicity, which disrupted plant metabolism [63,64].
TiO₂ nanoparticles mitigated these effects by improving root metabolic efficiency, enhancing water uptake, and promoting biomass accumulation [65].
This improvement can be attributed to the ability of TiO₂ nanoparticles to stimulate photosynthetic activity and activate antioxidant enzymes, helping to reduce oxidative stress [46].
These findings are consistent with the results of the present study, where foliar application of TiO₂ nanoparticles significantly improved plant height, biomass accumulation, and photosynthetic pigment content inMentha×gracilisunder salinity stress.
The enhancement of physiological traits and antioxidative responses in treated plants indicates that TiO₂ nanoparticles effectively mitigate salt-induced damage.
Therefore, our results confirm the potential of TiO₂ nanoparticles as a promising nanotechnological approach to enhance salt tolerance and overall growth performance in medicinal and aromatic plants.
Salinity stress significantly reduced chlorophyll content inMentha×gracilis, which is likely attributed to chloroplast structural damage and impaired photosynthetic enzyme activity under ionic and osmotic stress conditions[11,66].
The observed decline in chlorophyll a and b in our study supports the notion that salt stress disrupts thylakoid membranes and inhibits chlorophyll biosynthesis, ultimately reducing photosynthetic efficiency [35,67].
The reduction in chlorophyll a and b content under salt stress may also be attributed to the disruption of chloroplast ultrastructure caused by high salt concentrations [68], as well as the inhibition of pigment biosynthesis pathways [69].
Based on the findings of previous studies, TiO₂ nanoparticles have been shown to protect the chlorophyll structure under abiotic stress such as drought and salinity by improving light absorption and accelerating the transport and conversion of light energy, thereby preventing chloroplast senescence [70].
These mechanisms collectively support chlorophyll biosynthesis and stability during stress.
In the present study, a significant decrease in chlorophyll a and b content was observed under salinity stress, with a reduction of up to 52% and 57%, respectively, under 100 mM NaCl.
However, foliar application of TiO₂ NPs, particularly at 100 mg/L, significantly mitigated this reduction, resulting in chlorophyll a and b levels comparable to control treatments.
These observations align well with earlier reports showing that TiO₂ NPs can alleviate salt-induced declines in chlorophyll by maintaining chloroplast ultrastructure [70–72].
Oxidative damage caused by stress is often mitigated by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, including carotenoids, phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbates, α-tocopherols, and antioxidant enzymes, which protect cell components and prolong cell lifespan [47].
The increase in carotenoid content under mild salinity stress can be attributed to its antioxidant role in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing plant resistance to stress [11].
Supporting studies have shown that mild stress leads to higher carotenoid levels in medicinal plants likeSalvia officinalis[15].
Furthermore, titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles improved carotenoid content under salinity stress, likely due to reduced oxidative degradation and enhanced biosynthetic enzyme activity, along with better photosynthetic performance and increased light absorption by leaves [73].
Regarding proline and soluble carbohydrates, salinity stress significantly affected their levels.
Proline, an osmotic regulator, plays a vital role in osmotic adjustment and protecting cellular structures under stress [47].
Under salinity stress, proline levels significantly increased, aiding in oxidative protection and enhancing plant tolerance [74].
Similarly, soluble carbohydrates, serving as energy sources and osmolytes, help regulate osmotic pressure and improve stress resistance [75].
Under salinity conditions, soluble carbohydrate levels typically increase, providing energy and mitigating the negative effects of stress [73].
TiO₂ nanoparticles also enhanced proline and soluble carbohydrate levels inMentha x gracilisunder saline stress.
This improvement is attributed to the regulation of proline biosynthesis genes, enhancing plant resilience to stress [76,77].
This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that TiO₂ nanoparticles significantly increased proline and carbohydrate levels under salinity stress [78].
Also, this aligns with previous findings, where TiO₂ nanoparticles significantly increased leaf soluble sugar content, likely due to enhanced stress-related metabolic adjustments and starch hydrolysis under abiotic stress [79].
As drought and salinity both disrupt water potential and metabolic stability, the accumulation of soluble sugars acts as an adaptive osmoprotective strategy that maintains turgor pressure, protects macromolecules, and provides energy reserves during stress.
Therefore, the findings of the present study confirm that TiO₂ nanoparticles can enhance proline and soluble carbohydrate accumulation inMentha×gracilis, potentially improving osmotic adjustment and salinity tolerance by modulating carbon metabolism and reducing stress-induced damage.
Also, salinity stress significantly influenced the soluble protein content, which plays a key role in stress responses and metabolic regulation [47].
Under saline conditions, plants may exhibit an increase or decrease in soluble proteins, depending on stress type and duration.
Salinity often leads to the production of stress-resistant proteins and antioxidant enzymes, which aid in osmotic regulation and reduce oxidative damage [80].
Conversely, some studies report a reduction in soluble proteins due to protein degradation and decreased synthesis under stress [81].
Our findings showed that TiO₂ nanoparticles positively impacted soluble protein levels inMentha x gracilisunder salinity stress by enhancing enzymatic activity, and reducing oxidative damage [82].
These results are supported by other research showing significant increases in soluble protein levels in plants under salinity stress with TiO₂ nanoparticle application [35].
The observed increase in protein content may also be attributed to the role of proteins in maintaining membrane stability and supporting enzymatic functions, which requires protection against protein denaturation under stress conditions.
In this context, the accumulation of compatible solutes such as proline plays a key role by stabilizing protein conformation and preserving enzymatic activity through direct interaction with proteins and cellular structures [83].
This protective mechanism helps maintain soluble protein content under salinity stress, as observed in the present study where both salinity and TiO₂ nanoparticle treatments significantly enhanced soluble protein levels inMentha×gracili.
The results indicated that salt stress significantly affected the content of phenols and flavonoids in plants.
Phenols, known for their high antioxidant properties, increased significantly under salt stress.
This increase is attributed to their role in combating oxidative damage and reducing cellular stress [84].
Phenols, acting as defensive molecules, reduce ROS production and help protect cellular structures from salt-induced stress.
Similarly, flavonoids, another group of antioxidants, are also reported to increase significantly under stress conditions [47].
Flavonoids help mitigate oxidative damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus playing a critical role in enhancing plant tolerance to salt stress [17].
In line with our findings, researchers have shown that salt stress increases phenol and flavonoid levels in plant [75], suggesting a defense response to salt stress.
Based on the findings of this study, salinity stress significantly enhanced the accumulation of phenolic and flavonoid compounds inMentha×gracilisleaves.
The highest levels of total phenolics (53.18 mg GAE/g FW) and flavonoids (37.44 mg RE/g FW) were recorded under moderate salinity (50 mM NaCl).
These results are consistent with the observations in artichoke (Cynara scolymus), [85] andTagetes erecta[86], where moderate salinity combined with stress-alleviating treatments enhanced phenolic and flavonoid contents.
This suggests that moderate salinity may activate defense-related metabolic pathways, promoting the biosynthesis of polyphenols as part of the plant's stress adaptation mechanism [85].
Moreover, the synergistic effect of TiO₂ NPs likely enhances these responses by boosting ROS-related signaling or stimulating key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway [87].
Also, it is hypothesized that TiO2nanoparticles, by enhancing Rubisco protein levels and activity, boost the Calvin cycle reactions, leading to enhanced photosynthesis and increased plant resistance to salt stress [67,88].
Therefore, the combined use of nano-titanium and controlled salinity could be a promising strategy to enrich bioactive compounds with pharmacological value in medicinal plants.
Salt stress significantly increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), both of which are indicators of oxidative stress and cellular damage [89].
Elevated MDA levels reflect lipid peroxidation due to ROS activity, while increased H2O2levels signify the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative damage.
The presence of these compounds under stress conditions suggests a detrimental effect on plant health, as they contribute to the degradation of cellular components [90].TiO₂ nanoparticles (TiO2) were found to help reduce the increase in both MDA and H2O2by enhancing the plant's antioxidant defense system, thus mitigating oxidative damage caused by salt stress [67].
Based on the findings of the present study, the application of TiO₂ nanoparticles at 100 mg L⁻1, especially under moderate salinity stress (50 mM NaCl), significantly enhanced the activity of key antioxidant enzymes including SOD, APX, and GPX.
These results are consistent with Weisany et al. [56], who reported that increased enzyme activities under salinity stress are mainly due to the accumulation of H₂O₂ and the activation of plant defense systems.
Salt stress notably affected the activity of antioxidant enzymes.
Under salt stress, the activity of GPX (glutathione peroxidase) generally increased to counteract high hydrogen peroxide and ROS levels.
This increase in GPX activity helps reduce oxidative damage and enhances plant resistance to salinity stress [18].
Additionally, superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme, also showed increased activity under salt stress, as plants respond to higher superoxide and ROS levels [91,92].
On the other hand, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) acts as a crucial enzyme in reducing hydrogen peroxide, preventing oxidative damage.
However, the enzyme activity may vary with the intensity and duration of the stress, showing an initial increase followed by a potential decrease due to enzyme system damage [47].TiO₂ nanoparticles were found to effectively enhance antioxidant enzyme activity under salt stress by improving cellular structure and function [26,65].
The present study revealed that foliar application of nano-titanium significantly enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, APX, GPX) inMentha×gracilisunder salinity stress.
Specifically, guaiacol peroxidase activity increased by 165%, and ascorbate peroxidase activity rose by 176% under 50 and 100 mM salinity stress, respectively, when treated with 100 mg of TiO₂ nanoparticles.
These findings are in line with previous studies indicating that TiO₂ NPs enhance antioxidant defense systems in various plant species.
For instance, Jacob et al. [93], reported increased activity of antioxidant enzymes at 10–30 ppm TiO₂ NPs in beans, while similar enhancements were observed inSpinacia oleracea[94],Vitex agnus[95], Grapevine Saplings [96],Trigonella foenum-graecum[97].
Such activation likely contributes to improved ROS detoxification, membrane protection, and overall stress tolerance inM.×gracilis.
Furthermore, elevated intracellular levels of H₂O₂ under salt stress may act as a signaling molecule that induces APX activity, as also observed inDracocephalum moldavica[15].
In our study, the lowest H₂O₂ content was observed in plants treated with 100 mg L⁻1TiO₂, likely due to the significant upregulation of APX, GPX, and SOD activities in these treatments [15].
The detoxification of ROS following TiO₂ nanoparticle application may be attributed to the stabilization of cellular structures and the enhancement of membrane physical properties.
Supporting this, Lei et al. [11] demonstrated that TiO₂ nanoparticles, when applied under drought conditions, boosted antioxidant enzyme activities by reducing lipid peroxidation and strengthening membrane integrity.
The results indicated that salinity stress significantly impacts the percentage and yield of essential oils.
Salinity stress is one of the most crucial environmental factors affecting the metabolism of medicinal plants.
Under mild stress conditions, essential oil production increases in plants such as ginger mint.
This increase is typically due to the activation of defensive metabolic pathways that naturally occur in response to environmental stress [91].
Researchers have stated that, in response to stress, the activity of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of essential oils and other secondary metabolites increases [17].
Additionally, the accumulation of precursors (such as isoprenoids) and the reduction of their use in growth and biomass production pathways may also contribute to the increased essential oil production under mild stress conditions [47].
However, under severe salinity stress, with increased osmotic pressure, water and nutrient absorption by roots decreases, and this resource shortage leads to a reduction in the production of secondary metabolites involved in essential oil production [15,98].
Salinity stress also results in increased production of reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells and reduce essential oil yield [64].
In contrast, the application of TiO₂ nanoparticles to reduce the negative effects of salinity stress and improve essential oil yield showed significant results.TiO₂ nanoparticles improve soil structure and enhance the availability of water and nutrients, thereby increasing their absorption by the roots, which leads to increased secondary metabolite and essential oil production [46].
Moreover,TiO₂ nanoparticles can enhance the activity of enzymes related to essential oil synthesis, thus increasing the production of these compounds [99].
Additionally,TiO₂ nanoparticles help reduce the production of reactive oxygen species and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, which helps maintain cell health and improve both the quality and quantity of essential oils under salinity stress [100].
In support of our findings, various studies have shown that TiO₂ nanoparticles can effectively improve essential oil yield and content in plants under salinity stress conditions [15,26,77].
It should be noted that since essential oil yield is determined by multiplying the dry matter yield by the essential oil content, and these two factors are directly related, any factor that increases these two indices will lead to increased essential oil yield.
Therefore, it is expected that with the improvement of dry matter yield and essential oil content through titanium nanoparticle application, essential oil yield will ultimately increase [47].
Salinity stress can significantly impact the composition of essential oils in plants like mint.
Essential oils, which contain volatile and aromatic compounds, play a critical role in the quality and properties of medicinal plants.
Salinity stress can alter the composition and concentration of these compounds.
The increase in essential oil compounds under stress conditions is due to the higher allocation of carbon fixed during photosynthesis to the production of secondary metabolites, which enhances the plant's resistance to environmental stress by reducing reactive oxygen species damage.
In line with our findings, Bahreininejad et al. [101], reported that the thymol content in the essential oil ofThymus daenensisincreased under both mild and severe stress conditions compared to the control.
Our results indicated that TiO₂ nanoparticles can effectively improve essential oil composition under salinity stress.
TiO₂ nanoparticles enhance the activity of enzymes involved in essential oil biosynthesis and reduce oxidative damage, which can help preserve or increase the quality and diversity of essential oil compounds [26].
These nanoparticles improve growth conditions and reduce the negative effects of salinity stress, leading to increased concentration and diversity of essential oil compounds [73].
Furthermore, since elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for the formation of these compounds, the application of TiO₂ nanoparticles may supply the necessary nutrients, thereby increasing chlorophyll content, Rubisco enzyme activity, and consequently photosynthetic activity, essential oil yield, and composition [46,102].
In another study, foliar application of nanoliposome containing Fe2+element in sweet basil, enhanced the Fe content and essential oil composition [36].
Supporting our results, a study on coriander showed that applying 4 gr/L of titanium dioxide nanoparticles increased the percentage of linalool compared to the absence of fertilizers [103].
Additionally, Shenavaie Zare et al. [77] demonstrated that spraying 150 mg per liter of titanium dioxide nanoparticles increased stem dry weight, total chlorophyll, and main compounds of peppermint essential oil, such as menthol and menthyl acetate.
Another study on sage showed that the percentage of essential oil, oil yield, and main compounds such as cis-thujone, camphor, and 1,8-cineole increased by 75%, 174.5%, 87.5%, 30.8%, and 123.1%, respectively, when 200 mg per liter of titanium dioxide nanoparticles was applied compared to the control.
This study clearly demonstrated that salinity stress significantly reduced both fresh and dry biomass ofMentha×gracilis,while inducing marked increases in proline, soluble protein, and carbohydrate levels, suggesting an adaptive physiological response to osmotic stress.
Application of TiO₂ nanoparticles, particularly at a concentration of 100 mg L⁻1, effectively alleviated the adverse effects of salinity, resulting in improved plant growth parameters and enhanced essential oil yield.
The activity levels of key antioxidant enzymes—guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)—were notably elevated under salinity, especially in treatments involving Nano-Ti, indicating strengthened oxidative defense and reduced cellular damage.
Furthermore, GC–MS and GC-FID analyses revealed that Nano-Ti treatment increased the concentrations of major essential oil constituents, including linalool, trans-caryophyllene, 1,8-cineole, germacrene D, and γ-terpinene.
Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of Nano-Ti application as a promising approach to enhance both physiological resilience and phytochemical quality ofMentha×gracilisunder saline conditions, supporting its use in sustainable crop production systems facing salinity stress.
