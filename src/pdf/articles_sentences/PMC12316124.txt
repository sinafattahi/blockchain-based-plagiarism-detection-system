This study aimed to evaluate the influence of reader training and experience on the detection of (small) myocardial infarctions (MIs) and the assessment of ischemic scar transmurality using dark-blood late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and bright-blood LGE magnetic resonance imaging.
It was hypothesized that dark-blood LGE simplifies the detection of (small) MIs for less experienced readers, compared with bright-blood LGE imaging.
One hundred patients referred for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for suspected ischemic scar were retrospectively included.
Dark-blood LGE was performed first, followed by bright-blood LGE.
Nine clinicians, grouped into three levels based on their training and experience, assessed the LGE images for the presence of MI and ischemic scar transmurality.
Their assessment was subsequently compared with a European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging level 3 consultant.
Reader confidence was evaluated with a 4-point Likert scale.
Multilevel logistic regression was used to compare the 2 LGE methods and assess differences in myocardial infarction detection and transmurality among the 3 experience levels.
Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to compare the reader confidence between the 2 LGE methods, whereas Friedman omnibus tests were conducted to assess differences in reader confidence among the 3 experience levels.
Dark-blood LGE resulted in increased correct detection of MIs compared with bright-blood LGE for both level 1 (87.3% vs 82.7%, odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94–2.54],P= 0.083) and level 2 readers (89.7% vs 83.0%, OR: 2.05 [95% CI: 1.20–3.51],P= 0.009).
There was no significant difference observed between dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE for level 3 readers (88.7% vs 87.0%, OR: 1.20 [95% CI: 0.70–2.06],P= 0.495).
Level 2 readers significantly detected more small MIs correctly when using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE (66.7% vs 50.8%, OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.03–5.60],P= 0.042).
All experience levels showed significantly increased confidence in presence of ischemic scar and transmurality with dark-blood LGE.
Readily available dark-blood LGE can assist less experienced readers in correctly detecting and assessing (small) MIs compared with conventional bright-blood LGE.
Regardless of experience level, dark-blood LGE improves reader confidence in assessing the presence and transmurality of MIs.
Both conventional bright-blood and dark-blood LGE images are generally evaluated through visual qualitative assessment only.
In this regard, the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance states that “readers should have adequate training and clinical experience” when assessing cardiac MRI scans.11A study by Nies et al12showed that a less experienced reader was more confident when using reconstructed 2D dark-blood LGE compared with 2D bright-blood LGE for the detection of ischemic scar.
Research evaluating different LGE methods often uses only experts to review the images.13,14However, in clinical practice, less experienced readers may also review the LGE images, possibly influencing the patients' outcomes.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have researched the impact of the level of training and experience of readers on detecting MIs using different LGE MRI methods.
Therefore, the present study aims to determine the influence of reader training and experience on the assessment of (a) (small) MIs, (b) ischemic scar transmurality, and (c) reader confidence in detecting the ischemic scar tissue and its transmurality using both dark-blood and bright-blood LGE MRI.
It is hypothesized that dark-blood LGE cardiac MRI improves the detection of (small) MIs, especially for less experienced readers, compared with bright-blood LGE imaging.
A total of 100 patients referred for cardiac MRI for suspected ischemic scar were retrospectively included.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had suspected cardiomyopathy, a history of percutaneous coronary intervention and/or coronary artery bypass graft, and a cardiac device.
Additional exclusion criteria included general contraindications to MRI, such as gadolinium allergy and claustrophobia.
The study was approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (15/NS/0030), and all participants provided written informed consent for their participation and use of data for research purposes.
The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
All imaging data were randomly divided into 2 sets.
Set 1 consisted of 100 scans including the cine images with either dark-blood or bright-blood LGE images of each patient, whereas set 2 consisted of the cine images and the complimentary set of dark-blood or bright-blood LGE images of each patient.
This ensured that each reader reviewed the images of only 1 LGE method per patient in the first set of 100 scans (either dark-blood LGE or bright-blood LGE).
After an interval of at least 2 weeks, the other complimentary set of 100 scans was presented to the same reader.
All readers were blinded to the patients' clinical information and prior reports.
Using the 16-segment heart model, the readers assessed each segment for the presence of potentially viable infarction (≤50% LGE transmurality), nonviable infarction (>50% LGE transmurality), or no infarction.17,18Small infarctions were defined as involving 1 or 2 segments, whereas large infarctions were defined as involving 3 or more segments.
These outcomes were compared with the findings described in the original patient report, which served as the reference standard for the study.
The report was evaluated and approved by a single EACVI level 3 consultant, not included as a reader in the study, who will be further referred to as the “expert.” In addition, readers stated their confidence in both the presence of ischemic scar and ischemic scar transmurality on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = not confident, 1 = somewhat confident, 2 = confident, and 3 = very confident).
Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed data, median with interquartile range (IQR) for nonnormally distributed data, or as a percentage, unless stated otherwise.
Differences in the rates of correctly identified infarctions between dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE were tested using a multilevel binary logistic regression model, which accounted for the hierarchical structure of the data (ie, multiple readers assessing multiple patients).
The dependent variable in the regression model was correctly identified infarction and the independent variable (fixed effect) was the LGE method.
An interaction between the LGE method and size was tested.
Random intercepts for both patients and readers were included.
Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for the fixed effects.
The 3 levels of reader experience were compared using a multilevel binary logistic regression model, similar to the one previously described, with the key difference that the independent variable (fixed effect) was the experience level.
The analysis of reader confidence was limited to cases in which the reader identified the presence of an infarction.
Differences in reader confidence between dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE were tested using a pairedttest (for normally distributed data) or the Wilcoxon signed rank test (for nonnormally distributed data).
Additionally, reader confidence across the 3 levels of reader experience was compared using 1-way analysis of variance with repeated measures with post hoc pairwise comparisons or the Friedman omnibus test with Wilcoxon signed rank post hoc test, depending on distribution of the data.
Normality of data was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing.
To assess the interreader reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for each level and LGE method based on a mean-rating (k = 3), absolute-agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model.
All statistical analyses were 2-tailed and performed using SPSS (version 27; IBM, Armonk, NY) with a significance level of 5%.
The baseline characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table1.
Among the included patients (n = 100), 28 were women, and the median age was 63.5 (range, 26–89) years.
Based on expert consensus, the prevalence of MI in this patient cohort was 75% (75/100).
In these 75 patients with MI, 54 patients (72.0%) had a large infarction (≥3 segments involved), whereas 21 patients (28.0%) had a small infarction (1 or 2 segments involved).
Fifty-three (70.7%) infarctions were viable, and 22 (29.3%) infarctions were nonviable.
Imaging examples of both LGE methods can be found in Figure1.

Level 1 readers showed agreement with the expert for correct identification of MI in 87.3% ± 4.2% (262/300 assessments) and 82.7% ± 2.5% (248/300) of the cases when using dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE, respectively (Fig.2).
The percentages slightly increased for level 2 readers to 89.7% ± 1.5% (269/300) and 83.0% ± 3.6% (249/300), respectively.
Finally, for level 3 readers, the agreement was 88.7% ± 6.4% (266/300) and 87.0% ± 6.2% (261/300), respectively.
Supplemental Digital Content 1,http://links.lww.com/RLI/A1000, shows the percentage of correctly identified MIs for the individual readers.
Odds ratios for correctly identifying MIs using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE were 1.55 (95% CI: 0.94–2.54,P= 0.083) for level 1 readers, 2.05 (95% CI: 1.20–3.51,P= 0.008) for level 2 readers, and 1.21 (95% CI: 0.70–2.06,P= 0.495) for level 3 readers.
There was good interreader reliability for the 3 readers within each level (ICC > 0.75 for all levels).
No significant differences in the odds for correctly identifying MI were observed among the 3 levels of reader experience, using either dark-blood LGE or bright-blood LGE (Table2).
The sensitivity and specificity of dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE for the different levels of reader experience are shown in Figure3.
No significant differences in sensitivity and specificity were observed between the 2 LGE methods and among the 3 levels of reader experience, except that level 2 readers showed a significantly higher sensitivity when using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE (89.3% ± 4.8% vs 81.8% ± 5.0%, OR: 2.46 [95% CI: 1.27–4.76],P= 0.008).

Level 1 readers were able to correctly identify 63.5% ± 9.9% (40/63 assessments) and 55.6% ± 7.3% (35/63) of the small MIs with dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE, respectively (Fig.4).
For level 2 readers, the rates of correctly identified small MIs were 66.7% ± 9.5% (42/63) and 50.8% ± 7.3% (32/63), respectively.
Level 3 readers correctly identified 68.3% ± 11.0% (43/63) and 66.7% ± 8.2% (42/63) of MIs with dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE, respectively.
Odds ratios for correctly identifying small MIs using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE were 1.50 (95% CI: 0.67–3.36,P= 0.316) for level 1 readers, 2.40 (95% CI: 1.03–5.60,P= 0.042) for level 2 readers, and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.48–2.46,P= 0.837) for level 3 readers.
Level 2 readers were significantly worse at identifying small MIs correctly compared with level 3 readers (50.8% vs 66.7%, OR: 0.41 [95% CI: 0.17–0.95],P= 0.038) when using bright-blood LGE.
Apart from this, no significant differences were observed among the 3 levels of reader experience for either dark-blood LGE or bright-blood LGE.

Among the infarctions as assessed by the expert, level 1 readers were able to correctly assess the transmurality of the MI in 58.7% ± 8.7% (132/225) and 56.4% ± 7.6% (127/225) of the cases with dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE, respectively.
For level 2 readers, the rates of correctly assessing the transmurality of the MI slightly increased to 63.1% ± 5.4% (142/225) and 57.3% ± 4.6% (129/225), respectively.
Level 3 readers correctly assessed the transmurality of the MI in 64.4% ± 7.7% (145/225) and 61.8% ± 3.4% (139/225) of the cases with dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE, respectively.
Odds ratios for correctly assessing transmurality of MIs using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE were 1.13 (95% CI: 0.73–1.75,P= 0.581) for level 1 readers, 1.38 (95% CI: 0.89–2.13,P= 0.151) for level 2 readers, and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.74–1.89,P= 0.476) for level 3 readers.
For both dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE, no significant differences among the 3 levels of reader experience were observed (Table4).
Reader confidence in detecting the presence of ischemic scar tissue was significantly higher with dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE in all 3 experience levels (P= 0.003,P= 0.017, andP= 0.019, respectively) (Fig.5A).
Overall, level 2 readers were significantly more confident than level 1 and level 3 readers, both when using dark-blood LGE (P< 0.001 for both) and bright-blood LGE (P< 0.001 for both) (Fig.5B).

For confidence regarding the transmurality of the ischemic scars, readers of all 3 experience levels showed significantly increased confidence when using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE (P= 0.020,P= 0.008, andP= 0.005, respectively) (Fig.6A).
Level 2 readers were significantly more confident in assessing ischemic scar transmurality than level 1 and level 3 readers, both when using dark-blood LGE (P< 0.001 for both) and bright-blood LGE (P= 0.002 andP< 0.001) (Fig.6B).

This study determined the influence of the level of training and experience of cardiac MRI readers on the assessment of (small) MIs, ischemic scar transmurality, and on their confidence using dark-blood and bright-blood LGE imaging.
Three key results of this study are as follows.
First, when using dark-blood LGE, improved detection of MIs was observed compared with bright-blood LGE for level 1 and level 2 readers, with a significant difference for the latter group.
For level 3 readers, no significant difference between dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE was observed.
Second, when only considering small MIs, dark-blood LGE enabled level 1 and level 2 readers to detect more of these small MIs compared with conventional bright-blood LGE, with a significant difference for the latter group.
For level 3 readers, both LGE methods performed similarly in detecting small MIs.
Third, readers were more confident in assessing the presence of ischemic scar and ischemic scar transmurality when using dark-blood LGE.
These findings are in line with the hypothesis that for experienced readers, the choice of LGE method is less critical, whereas less experienced readers benefit more from using dark-blood LGE when detecting MIs compared with using bright-blood LGE.
A recent study by Nies et al12compared reader confidence of a single beginner and expert reader in detecting myocardial scar on cardiac MRI using 3 different LGE imaging methods: conventional breath-held 2D bright-blood LGE, free-breathing 3D dark-blood LGE,19and 2D dark-blood LGE reconstructed from the previous free-breathing 3D method.12The authors found that both beginner (with 2 years of experience) and expert (with >10 years of experience) readers were more confident with respect to ischemic scar detection using the reconstructed 2D dark-blood LGE method compared with 2D bright-blood LGE, although statistical significance was only reached for the beginner reader.
These findings are similar to the present study, where level 2 readers were significantly more confident when using dark-blood LGE compared with bright-blood LGE, while there was no significant difference for level 3 readers.
The main differences with the current study, however, are the well-defined and extended experience levels according to internationally established standards, multiple readers for each experience level (3 each), and readers from 4 different international centers.
Additionally, in the study of Nies et al,12differences in confidence scores between the beginner and expert reader were not statistically tested.
In 2018, Villa et al16conducted a study, using the same EACVI classification of competency, that investigated the effect of reader training and experience on the diagnostic accuracy of stress perfusion cardiac MRI for identification of coronary artery disease.
This study found a significant effect of the level of training and experience of readers on the diagnostic accuracy, with level 1 scoring the lowest and level 3 readers scoring the highest.
Since stress perfusion MRI is considered a more proficiency-demanding cardiac application compared with LGE MRI, the differences among level 1, level 2, and level 3 readers (55.7%, 65.7%, and 83.6%, respectively) were greater than in the current study, while the variability within each of the 3 levels (5.3%, 4.3%, and 2.3%, respectively) was smaller.
The lack of a clear distinction among the 3 levels of reader experience in the present study might explain why statistical significance was not always reached.
It should be noted, though, that the ICCs showed good interreader reliability within each level.
Training and experience of clinicians reviewing cardiac MRI scans is of high importance.11The present study suggests that dark-blood LGE improves the detection of MI compared with bright-blood LGE, particularly among less experienced readers.
While these findings are promising, further validation is needed to assess their generalizability.
In addition, future research should explore including more advanced imaging techniques, such as 3D LGE imaging,19,20which are increasingly adopted in clinical practice.
This study has several limitations that need to be discussed.
First, considering that the expert serving as the reference standard was an EACVI level 3 consultant, it was expected that all level 3 readers in this study would achieve scores close to 100%.
However, it is important to note that this expert had access to all available MRI sequences and clinical information, whereas the readers were provided only with dark-blood LGE or bright-blood LGE images, and the cine images.
The availability of additional clinical information could influence the final conclusion concerning the presence of infarction, potentially explaining the lower-than-expected performance.
Second, assessing expertise objectively is not trivial and has specific shortcomings.
For instance, EACVI levels 1–3 are primarily based on the number of reviewed cardiac MRI cases and CME hours, which may indirectly reflect expertise but do not account for factors such as innate ability and clinical judgment, especially in complex cases.
Given the relatively small differences between the 3 levels, the substantial within-level variability raises concerns about the accuracy of reader classifications.
Despite these challenges, the authors believe that classifying readers by expertise levels (level 1, level 2, and level 3) remains a reasonable approach, though more uniform guidelines for assessing expertise would be beneficial for future studies.
Third, among the 100 patients, 3 patients had 2 separate infarctions that were considered as 1 infarction: 2 patients had 1 large and 1 small infarction (both classified as 1 large infarction), and 1 patient had 2 small infarctions (classified as 1 small infarction).
Although our statistical analysis was not designed for multiple infarctions per patient, the authors feel that this limitation, given the small numbers, would not affect the results significantly.
Lastly, during all MRI scans in this study, dark-blood LGE (performed at approximately 10 minutes postcontrast) preceded bright-blood LGE (performed at approximately 20 minutes postcontrast).
Previous research has demonstrated that, as contrast agents wash out over time, T1values of scar and blood diverge, enhancing scar-to-blood contrast in LGE imaging.13,21This suggests a potential advantage for conventional bright-blood LGE over dark-blood LGE in this study.
However, in clinical practice, bright-blood LGE is typically performed at 10 minutes postcontrast, which therefore may result in greater differences in the detection of MIs between dark-blood LGE and bright-blood LGE than observed in the current study.
This study showed that readily available dark-blood LGE can benefit less experienced readers in correctly identifying and assessing (small) MIs compared with conventional bright-blood LGE.
In addition, the use of dark-blood LGE led to increased confidence when assessing the presence and transmurality of infarctions, regardless of the level of training and experience of the readers.
