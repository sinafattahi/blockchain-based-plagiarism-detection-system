This study aimed to investigate how which social identity is salient affects physiological responses to stress in women.
Specifically, we examined whether gender identity salience, compared to university student identity salience, would lead to significant differences in cardiovascular responses during a math stress task.
We conducted a between‐subjects experiment, where participants were randomly assigned to either a gender identity salience condition or a university student identity salience condition.
Ninety‐six female participants completed the math stress task.
Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were measured to assess physiological responses to stress.
Women in the gender identity condition exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses compared to those in the student identity condition.
No significant differences in heart rate were observed between conditions.
These findings suggest that gender identity salience amplifies physiological stress responses in women, providing insights into how group‐related processes impact health outcomes.
This study highlights the importance of considering identity salience in understanding women's cardiovascular response to stress.
We investigated whether identity salience can mitigate women's physiological responses to stress in response to calls for more objective measures in research relating to social identity and health (e.g. Haslam et al.,2018; McMahon et al.,2024; Steffens et al.,2021).
People's perception of stressors is influenced by their group memberships and social identities (Haslam et al.,2004; Haslam & Reicher,2006).
When a social identity becomes salient, it is activated and takes precedence, shaping the individual's perceptions, thoughts, and behaviours (Turner,1985; Turner et al.,1987,1994).
Gender‐related stressors, such as discrimination and negative stereotypes, are known to exacerbate stress.
In the example of women completing a math task, we hypothesise that if gender identity is salient, women may become more aware of negative stereotypes about women's mathematical abilities, potentially amplifying their stress response.
To investigate this, we compare physiological stress responses when participants' gender identity is salient versus when their university student identity is salient.
This allows us to assess whether salient social identities influence physiological stress responses in distinct ways.
Stress profoundly impacts overall health, a finding that is well established in the literature (e.g. Lovallo,2015; Thoits,2010).
Stress can be understood as a psychological and physiological response to an environmental demand (external stressor) that people perceive as threatening to their well‐being (Lazarus & Folkman,1984).
According to the integrated social identity model of stress, the groups people belong to and the social identities they acquire from these groups shape their experience of stress (Haslam et al.,2004; Haslam & Reicher,2006).
This model suggests that social identities can serve as both a protective and a risk factor, depending on the context, altering how individuals perceive stressors and manage stress.
Social identity resources such as a sense of belonging to groups, a sense of shared experience with other group members and multiple group memberships have been shown to reduce subjective stress at youth gatherings (Foran et al.,2025) during natural disasters (Muldoon et al.,2017) and following war – experiences (Skrodzka et al.,2024).
This dynamic interplay between stress and social identity highlights the importance of understanding how the salience of specific social identities can influence a person's stress appraisal.
When a social identity becomes salient, it significantly shapes how individuals evaluate the world, perceive tasks and, more specifically in this case, respond to stressors (Turner et al.,1987,1994).
Self‐categorisation theory proposes that the salience of an identity is influenced by how well individuals perceive themselves to fit within a group and their readiness to adopt that identity (Turner et al.,1987).
Support for this theory is offered by evidence that people's interpretations of stressors, as challenging or threatening tasks, are shaped by the group memberships and the social identities they prioritize in each context (Gallagher et al.,2014; Gillman et al.,2024; Haslam et al.,2004; Haslam & Reicher,2006).
Experimentally, subjective appraisals of stress have been shown to be linked to whether or not a group membership is salient (Levine & Reicher,1996).
Prior studies on identity salience (e.g. Fischer et al.,2010; Levine & Reicher,1996) have used gender identity, particularly with samples of women, as gender identity is a key social identity for this group.
A key paper by Levine and Reicher (1996) found that social identity salience affected how stressful participants perceived illness symptoms.
Women sports scientists found the threat of a facial scar more stressful than a knee injury when they had their gender identity salient, but the opposite when they used their sporting identity.
Levine (1999) conducted two experiments that replicated the findings of the previous study, namely, that social identification can buffer stress, and further demonstrated that even within the same social identity, altering the comparative frame (e.g., comparing oneself to an ingroup member versus an outgroup member) can significantly change how stressors are appraised.
The findings of Levine and Reicher's (1996) study and Levine's (1999) study show the importance ofwhichidentity is salient in relation to the subjective perception of a potential stressor.
We build on these studies to consider the impact of gender versus university identity on objectivephysiologicalstress among women.
In this study, we extend this work to consider whether objective indices of physiological stress can also be linked to identity salience.
There is emerging research on objective indices of physiological stress that are linked to social identity‐related processes.
Leveraging its established relevance in both health and social psychology, for example, Gallagher et al. (2014) conducted a laboratory study examining students' cardiovascular reactivity (CVR).
CVR refers to the physiological changes in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) that occur in response to stress or a challenging situation (Blascovich & Katkin,1993; Obrist,1981).
HR is typically measured in beats per minute.
Blood pressure consists of two phases: contraction (systolic SBP) and relaxation (diastolic DBP).
These two indices represent the force exerted by blood on artery walls as the heart contracts and relaxes.
CVR, the change in heart rate and blood pressure in response to stress, is well established as a reliable indicator of how the body responds to stress, with a substantial body of literature supporting its use (e.g. Brindle et al.,2014).
CVR within normative ranges can be thought to reflect healthy homeostatic regulation, whereas exaggerated or blunted responses suggest poor system regulation and are reliably associated with adverse health outcomes (Lovallo,2011; Turner et al.,2020).
Gallagher et al. (2014) used these CVR indices to assess ingroup and outgroup effects on physiological responses to a stress task.
The study manipulated whether information on the task came from an ingroup or outgroup member.
The results showed that being informed that the task was stressful by an ingroup member led to heightened cardiovascular responses in comparison to the same message from an outgroup member.
An extension of this study by McMahon et al. (2024) demonstrated that group status also played a crucial role in CVR to a stress task.
In the broader social identity literature, social identification has been shown to be a key basis for receiving and interpreting social support (Haslam et al.,2018; Levine et al.,2005).
Specifically, support is more likely to be perceived as intended when it comes from an ingroup member, with perceived social support found to influence the magnitude of CVR (e.g. Gallagher, Creaven, et al.,2021; Gallagher, O'Súilleabháin, & Smith,2021; Howard et al.,2017).
Building on this research, the current study uses CVR as a physiological measure to examine the impact of social identity salience on stress responses.
Previous experimental research has already examined the impact of social identity, specifically gender identity salience, on stress appraisal.
Vick et al. (2008) demonstrated that gender identity may play a crucial role in how women appraise potential stressors.
When women were informed that a math task was biased against their gender, they exhibited cardiovascular responses indicative of a threat state.
In contrast, those who were told the task was gender‐neutral displayed a response more aligned with challenge than threat.
Similarly, other studies have found that exposure to sexism—whether through interactions with a biased researcher (Salomon et al.,2015; Townsend et al.,2011) or reminders of negative gender stereotypes (Derks et al.,2011) resulted in heightened physiological responses.
These findings suggest that gender‐related cues may influence stress appraisal and affect physiological response to stress.
Further, Murphy et al. (2007) demonstrated how even subtle environmental factors, like gender representation, can influence women's cardiovascular responses.
Women who watched a gender‐unbalanced video of a math, science, and engineering conference experienced a faster HR compared to those who viewed a gender‐balanced video.
Situational cues may make gender identity salient; therefore, pointing to that gender identity, rather than just gender, can impact women's stress appraisal and the body's physiological response to stress.
Although prior studies, such as Murphy et al. (2007), suggest that gender identity may influence physiological responses to stress, direct empirical tests of this relationship remain limited.
The present study seeks to address this gap by examining the salience of gender identity in comparison to another salient social identity, that of a university student.
Women consistently report higher stress levels than men (American Psychological Association,2023).
Gender‐related stressors, such as discrimination and negative stereotypes, are an endemic feature of women's lives (United Nations Development Programme,2023).
When completing a math task, women may experience heightened stress if their gender is made salient, due to negative stereotypical views about women's mathematical abilities (Steele & Ambady,2006).
Cumulative research has shown that women perform worse on math tests when their gender identity is made salient beforehand (Krendl et al.,2008; McGlone & Aronson,2006; Shih et al.,1999; Steele & Ambady,2006).
These findings suggest that identity salience can negatively impact task performance, particularly in domains where stereotypes may be activated.
While much of the research has focused on performance outcomes, less attention has been paid to the underlying physiological or psychological mechanisms (e.g., cardiovascular responses, stress) that might mediate these effects.
On the other hand, when a student's identity is salient for women, the stress associated with a maths task may seem less challenging (Rydell et al.,2009).
We suggest that awareness of their identity, along with the value of that identity in relation to the task at hand, can alter both perceptions of stress and physiological stress responses in women.
This study provides the first evidence that the specific social identity made salient can influence stress responses in women.
Research highlights that identity salience influences subjective stress experiences.
Building on this, we examine whether identity salience also affects physiological stress responses.
While growing research explores the relationship between social identity and physiological stress, little focuses on identity salience specifically.
This pre‐registered experiment examined if identity salience affected women's cardiovascular reactivity when completing a math task.
Identity salience was manipulated, and either gender or university student identity was made salient during the task.
Math anxiety, body mass index (BMI), and age were planned controls as they were expected to influence cardiovascular reactivity (Gordon & Mendes,2021; Uchino et al.,2010).
We hypothesised that women in the gender identity salient group would exhibit significantly different DBP, SBP, and HR responses compared to those in the university student identity salient group.
The participants were healthy women university students over 18 years old.
The results report on the data of 96 participants who completed all measures.1Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 45 (M= 21, SD = 4.38); the majority were White (85.4%), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.31 kg/m2(SD = 4.02).
Participants were instructed in advance of the testing session not to consume alcohol or exercise vigorously for 12 h, not to smoke nicotine (cigarettes and vapes) or to take caffeine 2 h before the study.
It is standard practice to control for these variables, as they are known to affect cardiovascular reactivity (e.g. Griffin & Howard,2021).
Participants were excluded from participation if they were suffering from an acute illness, were taking any prescription medication that influenced cardiovascular function, such as blood pressure (excluding the contraceptive pill), did not follow the precautionary instructions, or were suffering from any long‐standing cardiovascular disease (CVD).
The experiment used a 2 × 2 mixed‐subjects design.
The between‐subjects variable was identity salience group.
Participants were randomly allocated into the gender identity salient group (n= 47) or the university student identity salient group (n= 49).
The within‐subject variable was a phase with two levels: baseline and task.
The dependent variables were the cardiovascular parameters of HR, SBP, and DBP.
Stress was induced using the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT).
Math anxiety, age, and BMI were planned covariates.
Math anxiety was included as a covariate as it was expected to affect the stress response to the addition test, which is the basis of the PASAT.
The identity manipulation was adapted from the “three things” method that Haslam et al. (1999) devised.
Participants were asked to list three things they have in common with either women (to make gender identity salient) or university students (to make university student identity salient).
A variation of this manipulation has successfully been used in prior work (Fischer et al.,2010; Skilton et al.,2024).
Before the stress task, participants were informed that they had been selected for the study because of their group membership as either ‘women’ or ‘university students’ to ensure the manipulated identity remained salient throughout the task.
Participants were informed that we were interested in how groups of women/ university students performed on the math task and that this was the main focus.
They were told that this would be the main focus of the analysis to increase motivation to perform well.
The 4‐min PASAT (Gronwall,1977) was used as the acute psychological stress task.
There is a wealth of research which indicates that the PASAT consistently disrupts the cardiovascular system (e.g. Gallagher et al.,2014; Howard et al.,2023; Phillips et al.,2009) and demonstrates good test–retest reliability (e.g Willemsen et al.,1998).
The PASAT recording played a series of single‐digit numbers from the computer speaker.
Participants were instructed to add each pair of numbers together, stating the answer while keeping the previous number in mind to add to the following number presented.
As the test progressed, the speed at which numbers were presented increased.
They were played at intervals of 2.4, 2.0, 1.6, and 1.2 s per number in each minute, respectively.
A 5‐s pause was given at the end of each minute.
The protocol was designed to increase psychological stress and has been successfully used in prior studies (Gallagher et al.,2014; McMahon et al.,2024).
For this reason, the experimenter wore a white laboratory coat and scored the answers while facing the participant at a distance to increase performance stress.
During the math task, the laboratory was semi‐dark, with a desk lamp pointed towards the participant.
Participants were informed that their performance was being assessed and recorded.
They would start with 110 points, and a point would be deducted for every incorrect answer.
A planned covariate was participants' feelings of math anxiety, which was measured using the Single–Item Maths Anxiety scale (Núñez‐Peña et al.,2014).
The item was ‘On a scale from 1 to 10, how math anxious are you?’, with 1 = not anxious and 10 = very anxious.
The cardiovascular functions of HR, SBP and DBP were measured using a Finapres NOVA device to record beat‐to‐beat readings (Finapres Medical Systems BV, BT Arnhem, The Netherlands).
Non‐invasive methods, such as the Finapres NOVA, are validated and have been used in prior cardiovascular reactivity studies (e.g. Griffin & Howard,2021).
The instrument takes continuous non‐invasive measurements through a finger cuff attached to the participant's middle finger on their non‐dominant hand.
Additionally, a second cuff was attached to the participant's upper arm, which was used to calibrate the reconstructions of intra‐brachial pressure derived from the finger cuff.
To ensure accuracy, a hydrostatic height correction system was employed to adjust the hand height to the level of the heart.
Cardiovascular reactivity was calculated as mean baseline minus mean PASAT for each of the cardiovascular outcomes (HR, SBP and DBP).
Ethical approval was granted by the university's research ethics committee.
The data analysis plan and measures were pre‐registered on the Open Science Framework (for OSF, seehttps://osf.io/krnxe/?view_only=be2f6be658aa47b99552d426607a9fb1).
Participants were recruited via the universities' research system and through flyer handouts.
University students were invited to partake in the study for course credits or an €8.50 lunch voucher.
To preserve the integrity of the experimental manipulation, participants were not informed in advance that the sample consisted exclusively of women university students.
To partake in the study, they were required to complete a pre‐screening questionnaire to deem eligibility– that they were women students with no cardiovascular‐related condition or taking medicine that affects blood pressure (apart from the contraceptive pill).
A 15‐min acclimatisation period began when the participant entered the lab.
During this period, participants were given an information sheet, gave informed consent, and completed lifestyle and cardiovascular‐related questionnaires.
The Finopress NOVA finger and arm cuffs were attached to the participant, and cardiovascular functioning started recording during this acclimatisation period.
Participants were instructed to keep the hand with the equipment face down on the table, resting their elbow on the table for stability.
They were informed they could not use that hand during the study.
The participants were watched throughout the study to make sure they followed instructions.
The Finopress NOVA was also monitored, which would allow sudden changes in readings to be detected, and an investigation into any issues to be conducted.
After the 15‐min acclimatisation period, a 10‐min baseline period began.
Establishing baseline measurements is essential for determining participants' normal physiological state, allowing us to assess the experimental manipulation's impact accurately.
During baseline, participants were given a magazine to read.
After the baseline period, participants were given the “three things” writing task, which was used to manipulate identity salience.
Participants were administered the pre‐stress task questionnaire before the 4‐min PASAT, and then the post‐stress task questionnaire afterwards.
The Finopress NOVA finger and arm cuff were detached, and participants' height and weight were measured in the lab to calculate BMI.
Upon completion, participants were fully debriefed.
The debrief sheet disclosed the use of deception for methodological reasons, outlined the study's purpose, and provided information on where they could seek support if needed.
Participants were excluded if they were ill (n= 7), had caffeine within 2 h before the study (n= 1) or had a medical condition that affects cardiac measures (n= 2).
Extreme outliers deviating <±3 SDs from the mean cardiovascular reactivity values were excluded (n= 1).
The final sample was 96 participants.
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 28.
Preliminary analyses of descriptive statistics and assumption checks for planned analysis were performed.
A series of 2 × 2 mixed ANCOVAs were conducted to examine the effect of identity salience (identity: gender vs. university student) for each of the cardiovascular parameters being investigated (SBP, DBP, and HR) at two time points (phase: baseline and task) while controlling for maths anxiety, BMI, and age.
Mean levels of all cardiovascular parameters during baseline and task are shown in Table1.
There was no main effect for identity salience group on baseline SBP (F(1, 91) = .22,p= .64, partialη2= .002), DBP (F(1, 91) = 1.49,p= .23, partialη2= .02) and HR (F(1, 91) = .44,p= .51, partialη2= .01).
This indicates that there were no differences in resting cardiovascular parameters between the two groups, suggesting that random allocation to experimental groups was successful.
A significant main effect of phase was found for SBP (F(1, 91) = 18.29,p< .001, partialη2= .17), DBP (F(1, 91) = 18.15,p< .001, partialη2= .17) and HR (F(1, 91) = 8.65,p= .004, partialη2= .09).
Increases from baseline to task for all cardiovascular parameters were observed, indicating that the PASAT was successful at inducing stress.
Means and standard deviations for planned covariates and cardiovascular parameters.
A significant effect of identity salience group × phase on participants' SBP was evident (F(1, 91) = 4.76,p= .03, partialη2= .05), where there was greater SBP reactivity to the PASAT in those where gender identity was salient compared to university student identity, as can be seen in Figure1.
A similar significant effect of identity salience group × phase was found for DBP (F(1, 91) = 4.59,p= .035, partialη2= .048), whereby larger DBP reactivity was evident during the stress task for participants in the gender identity group than those in the university student group, as evident in Figure2.
There was no significant effect of identity salience group × phase on HR (F(1, 91) = 2.85,p= .095, partialη2= .03), though the trend was in a similar direction; see Figure3.
The covariates did not significantly add to the analysis model for any of the cardiovascular parameters, as can be seen in Table2.
Analysis of variance was conducted without inclusion of the covariates for HR, SBP, and DBP, and the significant identity salience group × phase interactions did not change; this is reported in the AppendixS1.

In this laboratory experiment, we sought to investigate whether social identity salience affects cardiovascular responses to stress, addressing the increasing call for more objective health measures in social identity research (e.g. Haslam et al.,2018; Steffens et al.,2021).
Specifically, we focused on whether women's physiological stress responses during a maths task were contingent on whether their gender identity or university student identity was salient.
Our findings revealed that women in the gender identity salient group exhibited significantly higher SBP and DBP responses to stress than those in the university student identity salient group.
No significant effect of identity salience on HR reactivity was observed.
Our findings contribute to and extend the social identity approach.
Social identities can function as both a social cure and a social curse, depending on the context in which they are experienced.
This concept aligns with the broader social identity approach to health, which emphasises that context is crucial in shaping how identities influence individuals and groups.
In some cases, social identities provide a sense of belonging, support, and validation, acting as a social cure that promotes well‐being and resilience (Haslam et al.,2018; Jetten et al.,2012; Muldoon, Haslam, et al.,2019).
However, in other cases, identities can become a source of negative stereotypes and bias or even stigma and exclusion, resulting in them being more akin to a social curse (Kellezi & Reicher,2014; Wakefield et al.,2019).
Whether an identity is beneficial or harmful can depend on the specific context (Muldoon, Walsh, et al.,2019).
As context is an important determinant of social identity salience (Reicher,2004), the selected social identities relevant to the math task – gender identity and university student identity – had the differential effect on stress responses that would have been expected.
For women, when their gender identity was made salient during a math task, they exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to stress compared to those whose university student identity was made salient.
Our results highlight that identity salience can significantly impact physiological stress response, mirroring findings from earlier studies that found identity salience to influence stress perception (Levine,1999; Levine & Reicher,1996).
These findings underscore that the context in which an identity is activated is key to understanding how people physiologically respond to stress.
In other contexts, women's gender identity may be a source of a social cure offering access to social support and feelings of belonging (e.g. Haslam et al.,2018), while in the current context where performance on a mathematical task is prioritised, women's gender identity increased the stress response.
Understanding this dual nature of identities offers insight into the mechanisms behind both the social cure and social curse effects, highlighting the importance of the environment and social dynamics in shaping identity experiences.
Our findings contribute to and support the broader literature on how cardiovascular response to stress is influenced by group‐related processes (e.g. Gallagher et al.,2014; McMahon et al.,2024; Scheepers,2009; Scheepers et al.,2009; Scholl et al.,2018).
A substantial body of literature on the reactivity hypothesis has shown that individuals' cardiovascular responses to short‐term psychological stress in laboratory settings predict long‐term health outcomes (Chida & Steptoe,2010; Turner et al.,2020).
This is further supported by prospective studies showing that heightened stress reactivity is linked to negative cardiovascular outcomes, such as hypertension (Carroll, Ginty, Painter, et al.,2012), atherosclerosis (Barnett et al.,1997; Matthews et al.,1998), and even increased mortality risk (Carroll, Ginty, Der, et al.,2012).
It is important to note that cardiovascular responses to psychological stressors (such as the PASAT) in the lab environment have been shown to offer stronger support for the link between CVR and future risk of CVD.
Unlike tasks that involve physical exertion or pain, such as the cold pressor test, psychological tasks require mental effort and active coping.
These types of tasks are believed to mimic everyday stress more closely, making them especially valuable for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to disease development (Light et al.,1992).
Supporting this view, research has demonstrated that cardiovascular responses elicited in laboratory conditions are meaningfully related to responses to naturalistic stressors experienced outside the lab (Kamarck et al.,2000,2003; Turner et al.,1990).
It is important to acknowledge that not all increases in physiological activity reflect maladaptive processes.
For instance, elevated HR and SBP are often linked to adaptive responses such as task engagement and effort mobilisation (e.g. Gendolla & Richter,2005; Wright,1996).
Consistent with this, we observed the expected elevations in our results.
However, in this context, the lack of significant differences in HR and test scores between the two identity salient groups suggests that both groups exhibited similar levels of engagement.
There was also no significant difference in perceived task difficulty, anxiety, or perceived stress between groups (see AppendixS1).
Therefore, the difference between the two groups on blood pressure appears to be due to stress rather than performance‐related engagement or difficulty.
The observed differences in DBP are notable, as exaggerated DBP is thought to index vascular resistance and has been linked to long‐term cardiovascular risk (Low et al.,2009; Matthews et al.,2006).
Further, this may point towards preliminary evidence that the stress response was of a threat‐based nature rather than a challenge‐based nature (cf Howard,2023).
This is an intriguing consideration, but further research will need to examine the hypothesis that these effects arise due to the salient identity as woman disposing the participant to seeing the task as a threat rather than a challenge.
However, along with the impact on DBP, the effect on SBP is also quite noteworthy, as SBP has been suggested to be a more robust predictor of cardiovascular risk, compared to DBP and HR (Flint et al.,2019; Haider et al.,2003).
Matthews et al. (2006) found in a study of healthy young adults, using a video game stress task, that each 10 mmHg change in SBP during the video game was associated with 24% increased odds of having coronary calcification at the 13‐year follow‐up.
This association was held after controlling for common covariates (age, race, sex etc.).
Though the effect of identity salience on cardiovascular responses to the math task was small to moderate, these results are still meaningful, and their long‐term and cumulative effect merits future research.
Social identity processes, such as identity salience, may play a crucial role in understanding long‐term health outcomes due to their influence on physiological stress responses.
Understanding how group‐related factors contribute to physiological stress could provide insights into morbidity and mortality, especially within populations at higher risk for stress‐related conditions like CVD.
Women, in particular, consistently report higher levels of stress compared to men (APA,2023).
This is significant because stress is linked to a 40%–50% increased risk of CVD (Steptoe & Kivimäki,2012), which is the leading cause of death for women in high‐income countries and a major contributor to mortality in low‐income nations (Woodward,2019).
Understanding how gender is understood and embodied is key to understanding stress‐related health outcomes for both men and women, even if there is disparity in these processes.
These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also offer practical insights for policy development.
For interventions, it is vital to remember that “health does not occur in a social vacuum” (Tarrant et al.,2012).
Our results emphasise the role of women's social identities in shaping their physiological stress responses.
We know gender‐related stressors, such as discrimination and negative stereotypes, are an endemic feature of women's lives (United Nations Development Programme,2023).
The salient social identity for women influences how a situation or stressor is framed, which in turn influences physiological responses.
A potential avenue for intervention could involve encouraging women to adopt empowering social identities and leverage them to reframe situations or tasks in a way that reduces stress.
It is vital to note, though, that the responsibility for women's stress and anxiety should not be placed on individual women.
The heightened physiological responses women may experience because of their framing of stress in terms of gender is driven by context: how others and wider society treat and represent women.
To truly tackle increased stress linked to women's gender identity – change is needed in material realities of women's lives.
Were gender discrimination and stereotyping a thing of the past, then the likelihood that gender identity would amplify stress would be radically reduced.
While this experiment has a strong theoretical grounding, one important limitation of the current study is the absence of a control condition, without which it is difficult to determine the specific directionality of the effects observed.
It is possible that the gender‐related task elicited stereotype threat independently of the gender identity prime, and that the gender prime exacerbated this threat (consistent with a ‘social curse’ model).
Conversely, it is equally plausible that the university identity salience served to buffer participants against stereotype threat through an identity‐affirmation process (Derks et al.,2006,2011).
Most likely, both processes contributed to the pattern of findings.
However, we took an a priori decision not to include a non‐primed control condition and instead, use a primed identity as a control.
This was informed by a conceptual and methodological concern that omitting an identity prime would not guarantee a neutral baseline.
In the absence of a prime, participants may default to a personally or contextually salient identity, whether social or individual, which would introduce uncontrolled variability and undermine interpretability.
Given this, we chose to focus on two theoretically relevant identity primes.
In our data, we included a measure of strength of identification with both gender identity and university student identity; we ran a correlation examination to determine if the difference in strength of identification with the selected identity was associated with each CV outcome and found that there was no significant association between the two (see AppendixS1for correlation tables).
Nevertheless, future studies could expand on our study, with the inclusion of a suitable control condition to address this possible limitation.
One advantage of this study's sample was that the participants' identity as university students was directly relevant to the math task.
Future studies should examine more diverse samples to explore the relationship between identity salience, context and physiological response to stress.
Future research could build on these findings by examining whether thenatureof the stress task influences identity salience and cardiovascular reactivity to stress.
We know that context is an important aspect of identity salience (Reicher,2004); future research could examine if there are contexts where gender identity being salient may mitigate physiological responses to stress.
Some research suggests that the gender relevance of a task may lead to differences in stress responses (e.g. Stroud et al.,2001), while other studies have found that sex differences in stress responses occur regardless of the task's nature (e.g. Whited & Larkin,2009).
We propose that future research explore these conflicting results through the lens of the social identity approach, specifically by investigating the roles of gender identity salience during different, potentially gendered tasks.
Overall, these findings underscore the significant role identity salience plays in shaping women's cardiovascular responses to stress.
Our results contribute to the social identity approach and align with research on the intersection of social identity, group processes, and stress responses.
These results may offer some insight into the high rates of CVD among women.
While further research is needed to develop effective interventions, strategies such as identity management campaigns may help mitigate women's physiological responses to stress.
However, to meaningfully improve women's health, broader societal changes addressing gender‐related stressors are essential.
