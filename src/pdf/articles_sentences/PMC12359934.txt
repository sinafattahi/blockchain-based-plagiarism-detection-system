Evidence on the combined impact of healthy lifestyle factors on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the Iranian population is limited.
This study aimed to examine the association between a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) and the incidence of CVD.
This prospective cohort study, including 5419 adults aged over 35 years, was performed in the framework of the Isfahan Cohort Study (ICS) which is an ongoing study.
The HLS (ranging from 0 (unhealthy) to 4 (most healthy)) was derived from four modifiable risk factors: never smoking, diet quality, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI).
Investigated cardiovascular outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, unstable angina (UA), and CVD mortality.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and assigned 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Over a median follow-up of 11.25 years, 785 CVD events occurred, including 159 MI, 164 stroke, 369 UA, and 172 CVD deaths.
In the fully-adjusted model, participants with the highest HLS (3–4) had a significantly lower risk of stroke (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.31–0.83; P trend = 0.019) and a tendency towards lower risk of CVD (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61–0.98; P trend = 0.053) compared to individuals with the lowest HLS (0–1).
No significant association was found for MI, UA, or CVD mortality.
Age- and sex-specific patterns were also noted for stroke and overall CVD.
Our results suggest that a healthier lifestyle was linked to a reduced risk of stroke and showed a trend toward lower CVD risk among Iranian adults.
These associations may vary by age and sex.

• This study used a healthy lifestyle score based on four modifiable factors: Not smoking, eating a healthy diet, being physically active, and maintaining a normal body weight.
• It shows that adherence to a healthier lifestyle may help reduce the risk of stroke in Iranian adults.
• It also found a potential link between healthy habits and a lower risk of overall heart diseases.
• The study adds region-specific evidence from the Middle East, where such research is limited.
• It suggests that public health programs in similar settings should prioritize lifestyle-based strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity all around the globe [1].
According to the estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), the number of prevalent cases of CVD doubled between 1990 and 2019.
Over the period, trends in disability-adjusted life years (DLAYs) and years lived with disability also increased.
Moreover, 18.6 million CVD deaths were reported worldwide in 2019, of which one-third were considered premature [2].
It is noteworthy that more than 80% of CVD cases and deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries with accelerated epidemiologic transition [3].
Thus, targeting CVD risk factors is necessary to prevent a large proportion of cardiovascular events and premature mortality in these countries.
CVD burden is mainly attributed to modifiable risk factors with a global increasing trend [4].
Individual lifestyle risk factors for CVD include tobacco use, obesity, alcohol consumption, unhealthy dietary intake, and physical inactivity are well recognized [5,6].
Despite global efforts to promote healthy lifestyles, the interplay between lifestyle factors and CVD risk can vary across populations due to cultural, dietary, and socioeconomic differences; therefore, exploring context-specific lifestyle factors for CVD is a necessity [6].
For example, previous surveys among Iranian populations have indicated that over 59% of adults were overweight or obese, approximately 55% engaged in insufficient physical activity, and the prevalence of smoking is high in the population, particularly among men [7–9].
These patterns indicate the urgent need for improving lifestyle behaviors in Iran to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
Therefore, investigating the combined effect of modifiable behaviors within the Iranian context is crucial for developing effective public health strategies.
Some previous studies have investigated the combined effect of lifestyle factors on CVD risk [10–15].
Most of these studies have been performed in the U.S.
and European countries with high economic status, which limits the generalizability of their findings to the population of developing countries with socio-economic and cultural differences [16].
A limited number of preceding studies have evaluated the relationship between healthy lifestyle indices and CVD risk factors among Iranian adults [17–19].
However, no previous study has investigated the association of a healthy lifestyle score (HLS) with CVD incidence and CVD mortality in the Iranian population.
Thus, this prospective study aimed to investigate the association between an HLS and the incident CVD and CVD mortality among Iranian adults.
The conceptual basis of the present study is summarized in Fig.1, which indicates the theoretical framework linking healthy lifestyle factors to cardiovascular disease risk.
This study is a secondary analysis of the Isfahan Cohort Study (ICS), an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study in Iran, using data collected between 2001 (exposure) and 2013 (outcome).
Details regarding study design and methodology have been described elsewhere [20].
This study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Research Council at the Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, a partner Institution with the World Health Organization (WHO), Isfahan, Iran.
A signed written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study commencement.
A stratified cluster random sampling method was used to recruit participants aged 35 years or older with Iranian nationality from three central regions (Arak (n = 3323), Isfahan (n = 2153), and Najafabad (n = 1028)) of Iran from 2001.
Pregnancy and a history of CVD like myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure were considered exclusion criteria.
Currently, the ICS involves 6504 individuals comprising 3336 females and 3168 males.
For the present analysis, we excluded participants with missing data on any of the four lifestyle components used to calculate the Healthy Lifestyle Score (i.e., smoking status, diet quality, physical activity, and BMI).
In addition, individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline, or those lost to follow-up were also excluded.
Finally, a total of 5,419 participants were included in the final analytical sample.
The flow of participant inclusion and exclusion is presented in Fig.2.
No significant differences were observed in baseline sociodemographic or lifestyle characteristics between individuals who remained in the study and those lost to follow-up according to our previous analysis of ICS [21].
Therefore, loss to follow-up was assumed to be non-differential regarding both the exposure and outcomes.
Comprehensive standard questionnaires were used to gather information on sociodemographic, medical history, and lifestyle variables of individuals by trained health experts in a 30-min home interview session at baseline.
Participants provided information on current, never, and former cigarette smoking.
Individuals who were smoking at the time of recruitment or were former smokers were classified as smokers and those who had never smoked were classified as nonsmokers.
The international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to examine physical activity levels [22].
Based on the information provided by participants regarding the type and frequency of physical activities as well as time spent on, metabolic equivalent minutes per week (MET.min/week) were estimated.
Healthy physical activity was defined based on WHO.
Accordingly, at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity during a week or a combination of moderate and vigorous-intensity physical activity which is equal to 500 MET.min/week were regarded as healthy physical activity [23].
A validated Persian format of a 48-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect data on dietary intake [24].
To estimate the diet quality score, six main food groups including red and processed meat, fish, dairy, grains, fruits, and vegetables were used.
Scores were assigned to each food group based on the frequency of intake.
Such that, scores 10 for multiple times/day to 0 for never were assigned to grains, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables.
While scores 5 for multiple times/day to 0 for never were used to score the frequency intake of fish.
The intake of red and processed meat was scored with the same points as fish, but in the opposite direction (multiple times/day = 0 and never = 5).
The final score, ranging from 0 to 50, was obtained by summing up the assigned score to each food group.
Blood pressure was measured twice by a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer and the mean value was regarded as participants’ blood pressure.
Anthropometric assessments, including weight (kg), height (cm), waist and hip circumferences (cm) were performed by a trained staff based on standard protocols.
BMI was calculated by dividing weight by the height squared (kg/m2) and values between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2were considered normal.
Serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by the enzymatic method using a Hitachi autoanalyzer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was measured following the participation of the lipoproteins by dextran magnesium sulfate.
The Friedewald equation was used to estimate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in subjects with a TG level < 400 mg/dL.
Commercial kits were used to measure LDL-c by the turbidimetric method in individuals with a TG level of > 400 mg/dL.
The HLS was calculated by categorizing each lifestyle factor of smoking, physical activity, diet quality, and BMI into healthy (assigned score: 1) and unhealthy (assigned score: 0) groups.
In this study, alcohol consumption was not used in the HLS computation due to the lack of reliable information about it.
However, since this study was conducted among Muslims, who are forbidden from drinking alcohol, it cannot be a matter of concern.
Participants were assigned a score of one for healthy lifestyle behaviors, including nonsmoking (never smoking), being physically active (> 500 MET.min/week), healthy diet (diet quality score ≥ 34), and healthy BMI (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2).
The final score of the HLS was computed by summing up the scores of lifestyle factors and ranged from 0 (unhealthy) to 4 (most healthy) [25].
After baseline assessments, participants were followed up by telephone interviews every two years.
During each call, after confirming the participants’ identities, they were asked to state whether they are alive, has been hospitalized for any reason, including cardiovascular events, and present one of the following neurological symptoms: hemiparesis, dysarthria, facial asymmetry, imbalance, and transient monocular blindness.
If the participants experienced one of these events, the event data, physician diagnosis, and hospital name were recorded and the relevant questionnaire was completed.
In 2013, comprehensive structured interviews, physical measurements, and biochemical tests were performed in a similar manner to that at baseline.
Follow-up time for each individual was calculated from the date of recruitment when the baseline questionnaires were completed until the date of final events [20].
Cardiovascular events—including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and unstable angina (UA)—were initially reported by participants during routine follow-up through in-person or telephone interviews.
These self-reports were then systematically reviewed and confirmed by a team of physicians who used all available clinical evidence, such as hospital documents, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries [20].
The presence of at least two of the following criteria was used to diagnose acute MI: 1) typical chest pain lasting more than 30 min; 2) ST-segment elevation > 0.1 mV in at least two adjacent leads on the electrocardiogram, and 3) increase in serum concentrations of cardiac markers [26].
Stroke was defined based on the definition proposed by the WHO.
Accordingly, a rapid onset focal neurological disorder lasting at least 24 h with a vascular origin can be identified as a case of stroke.
Unstable angina (UA) was considered typical chest pain lasting at least 20 min on the day before hospital admission, with a change in the usual angina or pain pattern representing a crescendo pattern and described as a severe and persistent pain.
UA cases may be new or diagnosed based on dynamic ST-segment or T-wave changes in at least two adjacent electrocardiographic leads [20].
Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 20 and the value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Participants were categorized based on the score of HLS into three groups (0–1, 2, and 3–4).
Continuous (represented as mean ± SD) and categorical (expressed as a percentage) variables were compared across categories of the HLS by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square test, respectively.
Hazard ratios (HRs) and their attributed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular events across categories of the HLS were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression in crude and multivariable-adjusted models.
The first category of the HLS was considered the reference category in all models.
In the first model, adjustments were made for age (continuous) and sex.
In the second model, residency location, marital, and educational status were additionally adjusted.
Finally, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were added to the adjustments in the third model.
Furthermore, stratified analyses were performed based on sex and age (< and > 60 years).
The proportional hazards assumption for the Cox models was tested using Schoenfeld residuals, and no significant violations were observed.
In order to identify any statistically significant linear trend in the risk of cardiovascular events across HLS tertiles, p for trend was calculated using Mantel–Haenszel test.
A total of 5419 participants were included in this study, of which 2641 (48.7%) were men.
The mean (SD) age and BMI of subjects were 50.7 ± 11.62 years and 26.6 ± 4.45 kg/m2, respectively.
General characteristics and dietary intake of participants are depicted in Table1.Participants in the top category of HLS were younger, and had lower BMI, WHR, SBP, DBP, FBS, TC, LDL-c and TG, but higher HDL-c levels compared to those in the bottom category.
They were also more likely to live in rural areas, but less likely to be highly educated or smoker.
Furthermore, HTN, T2DM and dyslipidemia were less frequent in subjects in the highest category of HLS than those in the lowest one.
Regarding dietary intake, fish, total grains, dairy, fruits and vegetables were consumed in greater amounts by the participants in the highest category.
Table2reports the crude and multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for cardiovascular events incidence across different categories of HLS.
The P-trend indicates if there is a statistically significant linear trend in the risk of cardiovascular events across HLS tertiles.
In crude model, subjects in the highest category of HLS had 35–54% lower risk for CVD, stroke, and UA than those in the lowest category.
When potential confounders were taken into account, the association remained significant for stroke (HR = 0.51: 95% CI: 0.31, 0.83, P trend = 0.019) and showed a tendency toward a lower risk of CVD (HR = 0.78: 95% CI: 0.61, 0.98, P trend = 0.053).
Regarding UA, controlling for mediators disappeared the significance (HR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.06, P trend = 0.095).
The HLS was not associated with the risk of MI and CVD mortality in any of the models.
Table3shows the crude and multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for cardiovascular events incidence across different categories of HLS stratified by sex and age.
In males, no significant association was found between HLS and risk of any cardiovascular events either in the crude or the adjusted model.
In females, in the crude model, being in the highest versus lowest category of HLS was associated with decreased risk of CVD, stroke, and UA.
However, adjustment for potential confounders eliminated the significance for CVD (P trend = 0.398) and UA (P trend = 0.222) but not stroke, although the effect was slightly attenuated (HR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.62, P trend = 0.016).
In the age group of ≥ 60 years, in crude model, subjects in the top category of HLS had lower risk of CVD, MI, UA, and stroke than those in the bottom category.
In adjusted model, this association remained significant for stroke (HR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.56, P trend < 0.001), tended to be lower for CVD (P trend = 0.06) and became non-significant for MI (P trend = 0.684) and UA (P trend = 0.126).
Findings of the present cohort study indicated that the incidence of cardiovascular events tended to be lower in subjects who had higher HLS.
Amongst various cardiovascular events, only incident stroke was significantly and independently related to HLS, whereas the inverse association of HLS and UA was mediated by metabolic risk factors.
Stratified analysis revealed that the association of stroke with HLS was more evident in females and older adults and the tendency towards lower risk in subjects with a higher score was only observed in older adults.
In accordance with previous studies conducted in European countries and the U.S., we found an inverse significant relationship between the HLS and CVD risk [10,12,27–31].
However, the recognized association in the present study is not as strong as that in previous studies.
For example, the findings of the SUN cohort study indicated that higher adherence to HLS (containing traditional lifestyle factors combined with other beneficial habits like no binge drinking, low TV watching time, taking short naps, spending time with friends, and working > 40 h/week) was related with a 78% reduced risk of CVD after a median follow- up duration of 10.4 years [10].
Similarly, the results of the study by Guasche-Ferre et al. showed that higher adherence to a combination of traditional lifestyle score and healthy sleep duration substantially decreased the risk of CVD, coronary heart disease, and stroke in U.S.
adults [12].
Furthermore, we found no significant association between MI and the HLS.
In contrast to our findings, results of a prospective study by Ford et al., involving 23,153 German participants, reported that adhering to four healthy lifestyle factors of never smoking, BMI < 30 kg/m2, physical activity ≥ 3.5 h/week, and healthy diet intake was associated with an 81% reduced risk of MI after a mean follow-up duration of 7.8 years [32].
Another prospective cohort study of 20,721 healthy men also indicated an 86% reduced risk of MI in subjects who had higher adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors [33].
The different findings of the present study may be explained by the different investigated healthy lifestyle behaviors, and their defined cut points.
The majority of previous studies have regarded alcohol consumption as a component of healthy lifestyle indices.
Regarding religious issues and the lack of reliable data on alcohol consumption in the Iranian population, it was not included in the HLS calculation in the present study.
Furthermore, we regarded the consumption frequency of six main food groups to quantify diet quality.
However, dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet [10,11,27,31] and healthy eating index [12,28,30,34] have been regarded as indicators of healthy eating habits in many previous studies.
We also did not include other potential CVD lifestyle risk factors like TV watching and sleep duration in the HLS.
Previous evidence has demonstrated that males are at higher biological risk of CVD compared to females; nevertheless, a higher mortality rate and poor prognosis have been observed in females with CVD [35,36].
In addition, although traditional lifestyle CVD risk factors, are common among both males and females, their impact and burdening effect are sex-dependent [37–39].
Thus, applying sex-specific lifestyle modification approaches for CVD prevention are of great importance.
Our results indicated that the relationship between the HLS and CVD and stroke risk was stronger among females.
Few number of preceding studies have also reported greater reduced risk of CVD in females with high adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors than males [34,40].
We also observed a greater reduced risk of stroke and CVD in old adults with higher HLS.
This observation may be attributed to different CVD risk factors profile in various life periods.
It should be noted that this finding might be due to higher occurrence of CVD events in older adults which allowed us to detect the significant association.
Further research emphasizing the confounding role of sex- and age-specific CVD risk factors are needed to obtain robust findings regarding the beneficial effect of healthy lifestyle behaviors for CVD prevention in age and sex categories.
Several biological and behavioral mechanisms may underlie the inverse association observed between higher healthy lifestyle scores and reduced risk of stroke and CVD.
According to HLS, a healthy lifestyle includes adherence to a balanced diet, regular physical activity, non-smoking status, and maintaining a healthy body weight—all of which have established roles in cardiovascular health.
For example, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and unsaturated fats are associated with reduced systemic inflammation, improved endothelial function, and favorable lipid profile as significant predictors of CVD [41–43].
In addition, regular physical activity can decrease the risk of CVD by improving vascular health and various metabolic risk factors such as blood pressure, lipid, and glucose profiles [44].
Avoidance of tobacco reduces oxidative stress and prevents endothelial dysfunction, which is a key step in atherogenesis and CVD pathogenesis [45,46].
Moreover, maintaining a normal BMI helps to reduce central adiposity, which is closely linked to metabolic syndrome and chronic low-grade inflammation as CVD risk factors [47].
Therefore, the combined effect of these behaviors can lower arterial stiffness, improve autonomic balance, and reduce thrombotic risk, ultimately contributing to a lower incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events.
The present study has several strengths and limitations that should be noted.
First, it is a large population-based cohort study with a prolonged follow-up duration on a representative sample of the Iranian population and therefore our findings have good external validity for Iranian population.
Second, the study contains comprehensive clinical, dietary, and lifestyle data allowing us to combine major lifestyle determinants of CVD.
In contrast to the majority of previous studies that assessed single lifestyle behaviors in relation to CVD risk, we examined a composite lifestyle score in relation to CVD risk among the Iranian population.
This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged.
First, the dietary data were collected using a validated Persian version of the FFQ, which included a limited number of food items and relied on self-reported information, making it susceptible to recall bias and misreporting.
To classify participants based on dietary quality, we applied a simplified diet quality score using the total consumption of broad food groups such as vegetables, grains, and dairy products, rather than specific healthy components within each group.
Given the complexity of food-nutrient interactions, this approach may not fully reflect the quality of dietary intake for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.
Second, although adjustments were made for several sociodemographic and clinical variables, the potential for residual confounding due to unmeasured or unknown factors—such as sleep duration, psychological profile, and sex-related covariates—cannot be excluded.
Third, due to cultural and religious sensitivities, as well as concerns about underreporting and data reliability, alcohol intake was not assessed.
However, we acknowledge that some individuals may still consume alcohol, and its omission could have led to residual confounding.
Fourth, survival bias may have influenced our findings, as individuals with more severe health conditions or unhealthy lifestyles may have died before being included in the study.
Lastly, due to differences in cultural, dietary, and lifestyle patterns, as well as the specific epidemiological characteristics of CVD in the Iranian population, the generalizability of our findings to other populations should be interpreted with caution.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that higher HLS was associated with lower risk of stroke and tended to lower risk of CVD in Iranians.
This association may differ by age group and sex.
These findings suggest that public health programs addressing combined lifestyle risk factors may be effective for CVD risk reduction.
