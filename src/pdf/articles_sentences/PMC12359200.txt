Clozapine is superior in the treatment of treatment‐refractory schizophrenia but requires therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) due to its unpredictable pharmacokinetics and dose‐dependent side effects.
This systematic review evaluates saliva as a more patient‐friendly sampling strategy for clozapine TDM.
A systematic search was carried out using MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCTR) through Ovid.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if data on clozapine pharmacokinetics in saliva were described.
To assess the feasibility of saliva for the TDM of clozapine, ease of saliva collection, method of detection, detectability of clozapine in saliva, correlation of clozapine concentrations in saliva compared to blood, clozapine stability in saliva, and clinical validation were taken into account.
A total of nine studies were included.
Overall, the collection of saliva was considered simple, less invasive, and quick compared to the collection of blood.
Clozapine was found stable for up to 6 months when stored at −20°C.
Various methods were used for the detection of clozapine with a lower limit of detection (LLOQ) ranging from 0.1 to 15 ng/mL.
Clozapine saliva concentrations between 8.50 ng/mL and 2,720 ng/mL were observed, and no correlation between clozapine levels in saliva and blood was found.
Although saliva is a promising specimen for the TDM of clozapine, no clear recommendation could be made to replace blood with saliva due to methodological issues with the included studies.
For this reason, further clinical validation studies are needed.
Clozapine was approved for use in the early 1970s but has remained superior in the treatment of treatment‐refractory schizophrenia compared to other antipsychotics [1,2].
In addition, it appears to be effective in indications such as schizoaffective disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and drug‐induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease [3,4,5].
Even though clozapine is found to be the most effective antipsychotic in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia [6,7], its use is limited due to severe side effects like agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and an increased risk of seizures [8,9,10].
Clinical response and the increased risk of seizures are strongly related to clozapine plasma levels [11,12,13].
Concentrations ranging between 350 and 600 ng/mL showed significant therapeutic superiority compared to concentrations below 350 ng/mL [14].
An increased risk of toxicity was seen at a clozapine concentration of 750 ng/mL [12], and seizures were reported at clozapine concentrations > 1300 ng/mL [11].
For this reason, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended during clozapine treatment.
TDM is particularly useful for clozapine because maintaining adequate drug levels can be challenging due to a number of factors that influence clozapine pharmacokinetics.
Smoking, for example, can lower clozapine drug levels by 30% [15,16], whereas concomitant fluoxetine treatment can increase clozapine concentrations by 40%–70% [17].
TDM can also be a useful tool when therapy compliance is questioned or when poor drug response is observed despite adequate dosing [18,19].
N‐Desmethylclozapine is an active metabolite of clozapine, and therapeutic outcome can be predicted from its ratio to clozapine in serum [20].
Moreover, high N‐Desmethylclozapine levels are significantly correlated with side effects like weight gain [21].
Therefore, TDM of clozapine and its metabolite is also useful.
Clozapine TDM is a well‐established practice; however, blood sampling is an invasive procedure that can cause discomfort, especially in children and cognitively impaired patients [22].
In addition, transportation to a specialized lab is required as liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) is used for the quantification of clozapine, often resulting in prolonged turnaround times, making real‐time decisions difficult [23].
A potential alternative would be the use of saliva for the quantification of clozapine because collecting this is a fast, non‐invasive, and easy‐to‐handle procedure compared to blood sampling [24].
Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the feasibility of saliva as an alternative matrix for the TDM of clozapine.
This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement [25].
The systematic search was carried out using MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCTR) through Ovid from the inception until February 3, 2025.
The following predefined search key was performed: (clozapine/or clozapine.mp.)
and (saliva/or saliva.mp.
or oral fluid/or oral fluid.mp.
The acquired articles were imported to the online review software Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Australia), and duplicates were removed.
Two independent authors screened all studies based on the inclusion criteria.
Subsequently, the full text of the remaining articles was screened to select eligible studies.
Any disagreements between the reviewers during the selection process were resolved through discussion and consensus.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if data on clozapine pharmacokinetics in saliva was described.
Studies were excluded if they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) not written in English, (2) lacking relevant data, and (3) meta‐analysis, reviews, and case reports.
A validated tool to assess the risk of bias of pharmacokinetic studies was not available.
Therefore, the risk of bias was assessed by evaluating components crucial for the interpretation of such study results.
The risk of bias was assessed by one author and verified by a second author.
The following elements were assessed: number of participants, condition for which clozapine is given, PK altering comorbidities, interacting drugs, smoking, dose, validated assay, specimen handling, saliva sample collection, sample collection time(s), total number of plasma samples, total number of saliva samples, number of samples per participant, method of AUC calculation, paired sample comparison or AUC comparison, and statistical method of comparison.
Basic characteristics of the included studies were extracted, including author, year of publication, country, study period, study design, number of participants and samples, their age, and condition for which clozapine was given, pharmacokinetic comorbidities, interacting co‐medication, and smoking behavior.
Other information that was extracted was clozapine dose, clozapine plasma concentration, clozapine saliva concentration, clozapine plasma/saliva ratio, AUC calculation, quantification technique, whether the quantification technique was validated, method of comparison, and, if available, information on clozapine metabolites.
To assess the feasibility of saliva for the TDM of clozapine, the following aspects were taken into account: method and ease of saliva collection, sample handling, timing of sample collection, hypersalivation or drugs taken to reduce hypersalivation, detectability of clozapine in saliva, clozapine stability in saliva, correlation of clozapine concentrations in saliva compared to blood, and clinical validation.
Data extraction was performed by one author and verified by a second author.
The search resulted in a total of 227 publications.
After removing the duplicates, 164 articles were screened on title and abstract, which resulted in 24 potentially relevant articles.
A total of 15 articles were excluded after reading the full text, which resulted in nine included articles [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34].
The included studies were published between 2014 and 2024 and conducted in Portugal [27,32], France [31], Poland [30,34], South Africa [26,33], Belgium [29], and China [28].
Seven [26,27,29,30,31,32,34] out of the nine articles were validation studies; two [28,33] were clinical trials.
Of the validation studies, five [26,27,29,30,31] collected both saliva and blood samples, of which four [26,29,30,31] specified that sample collection occurred simultaneously.
One [33] of the two clinical trials also collected saliva and blood samples concomitantly.
The other clinical trial [28] collected only saliva; however, this was the only study that did an AUC‐based analysis and that included only healthy volunteers.
All other studies [26,27,29,30,31,32,33,34] collected single patient samples, of which some were paired.
The studies had a sample size ranging from 9 to 200.
The characteristics of the included studies are displayed in Table1.
Abbreviations: GBO, Greiner Bio‐One; GC–MS/MS, chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC‐DAD, high‐performance liquid chromatography combined with a diode array detector; HPLC‐UV, high‐performance liquid chromatography combined with a UV detector; LC–MS/MS, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; ND, not described; UHPLC–DAD, ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography combined with a diode array detector; UHPLC–MS/MS, ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.
All included articles were evaluated for the presence or absence of essential components to assess the risk of bias.
No study described smoking behavior, and only one study mentioned that it had taken into account pharmacokinetic comorbidities and interacting co‐medication [28].
Three studies [28,29,31] clarified for which indication clozapine was prescribed, of which one administered clozapine in healthy individuals [28].
All studies used a validated method for the quantification of clozapine in saliva, and all studies described their specimen handling [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34].
Only one study [28] calculated the AUC of clozapine in saliva; all other studies analyzed only single saliva samples [32,34] or paired saliva–plasma samples [26,27,29,30,31,33].
Of the studies that analyzed single paired samples, three did a correlation assessment by making a scatterplot together with a trendline [26,29,33].
Overall bias per study is shown in Table1, and detailed results are available in TableS1.
The included studies used different methods for the collection of saliva, which included the spitting or drooling method [27,31,32,33,34], the use of the Salivette collection device [28,34], the Quantisal device [29], the Thermo Fisher Scientific Oral‐Eze device [26], or the Greiner Bio‐One (GBO) device [26] (Table1).
Overall, the collection of saliva was considered simple, less invasive, and quick compared to the collection of blood [27,28,29,30,31,32].
Three studies [26,29,31] collected a saliva sample 10–17 h post clozapine dose, whereas one study [30] timed the sample collection 2 h after drug administration.
Another study [28] administered a single dose of 12.5 mg clozapine in healthy volunteers and collected saliva samples at timepoints 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 51, 82, and 130 h. Four studies [27,32,33,34] did not specify the timing of sample collection.
One study [31] only included patients with a constant dose of clozapine for at least 7 days; another study [26] described a minimal stable dose of 4 weeks.
The remaining seven studies [27,29,30,32,33,34] did not describe a minimal time of a stable clozapine dose.
All studies described storage conditions between −18°C and −25°C until analysis, except for one [29] which stored the sample at 4°C.
Most studies [26,27,28,29,31,32,33,34] implemented an extraction step before sample analysis (Table1).
Methods of extraction included liquid–liquid extraction [26,29,31,33,34], solid‐phase extraction [27,28], and solvent extraction from dried saliva spots [32].
The nine included studies described the use of five different analytical methods (Table1).
Three studies [26,28,33] used liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS); two studies [27,32] used gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS); two other studies [30,34] used (ultra‐)high‐performance liquid chromatography combined with a diode array detector ((U)HPLC‐DAD).
Of the remaining two studies, one used [29] ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) and one [31] high‐performance liquid chromatography combined with a UV detector (HPLC‐UV) as method of detection.
The lower limit of detection (LLOQ) for clozapine ranged from 0.1 to 15 ng/mL [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34].
All studies were able to detect clozapine in patient saliva.
The detected saliva concentrations ranged from 8.50 to 2720 ng/mL.
One study [29] did not report the absolute saliva clozapine concentrations; they only presented the saliva to plasma ratio (mean: 2.75 (SD 3.84)).
They also described the mean saliva/plasma ratio of N‐desmethylclozapine, which was 3.69 (SD 3.91).
Another study [33] presented a mean plasma to saliva ratio of 3.6 (range 0.1–8.8) together with the mean N‐desmethylclozapine plasma/saliva ratio of 3.6 (range 1.0–9.0).
The plasma to saliva ratio for clozapine could be calculated for three other studies, resulting in mean values of 2.3 (range: 1.1–5.3,n= 14) [31], 1.8 (range 1.8–1.9,n= 2) [27], and 1.7 (n= 1) [30].
All ratios were based on paired samples.
One study [28] analyzed clozapine pharmacokinetics together with its two metabolites (N‐desmethylclozapine and clozapine‐N‐oxide) in saliva.
After the administration of 12.5 mg clozapine in healthy volunteers, saliva was collected at timepoints 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, 51, 82, and 130 h. Clozapine and N‐desmethylclozapine were detectable up to 130 h in saliva, while clozapine‐N‐oxide was detectable up to 36 h after administration.
This study [28] also described the Tmaxof clozapine, N‐desmethylclozapine, and clozapine‐N‐oxide, which was observed at 4.53 ± 3.61 (range: 0.50–12.00), 9.38 ± 9.33 (range: 5.00–51.00), and 4.53 ± 2.19 (range: 0.00–12.00), respectively.
The observed T ½ of clozapine, N‐desmethylclozapine, and clozapine‐N‐oxide was found at 53.58 ± 52.28 (range: 8.65–226.35), 62.67 ± 82.57 (range: 12.37–462.99), and 19.15 ± 23.11 (range: 3.65–82.85), respectively.
Details of the included studies on clozapine and N‐desmethylclozapine concentrations are shown in Table2.
Described concentrations of clozapine and N‐desmethylclozapine.
Abbreviations: GBO, Greiner Bio‐One;n, number of samples; NA, not applicable; ND, not described; SD, standard deviation; UD, undetectable.
The stability of clozapine in saliva was assessed in five studies [26,29,32,33,34].
One study [33] found that clozapine in saliva is stable for at least 2 months when stored at −21°C.
Another study [26] found that saliva samples were stable for 6 months at −18°C to −20°C if prepared in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid, deionized water, or the buffers provided by the manufacturers of the Oral‐Eze device or the GBO device.
The stability at room temperature was confirmed to be at least 24 h [32]; longer periods were not studied.
Sample stability was proven for three freeze–thaw cycles [32].
The study that used the Quantisal collection device [29] tested the stability at 4°C and found that clozapine was stable at least 7 days when stored in the manufacturer's buffer solution.
The aim of this review was to assess whether saliva can be used for the therapeutic drug monitoring of clozapine.
Even though all studies were able to detect clozapine in saliva, no clear correlation between the concentrations in saliva and the concentrations in plasma was found.
The collection of saliva was considered simple, less invasive, and quick compared to the collection of blood.
The stability of clozapine in saliva was at least 24 h at room temperature and up to 6 months at −21°C.
Most studies only assessed a small number of patient samples, hence the limited amount of data on clozapine saliva concentrations.
Moreover, not all studies collected paired saliva and plasma samples, which made it difficult to assess the correlation between these two.
One study [28] analyzed plasma and saliva samples after a single low dose of clozapine; however, analyzing clinical population samples would be more representative given the high rates of smoking and concomitant medication in this population [35].
All studies were able to detect clozapine in saliva, which confirms the presence of clozapine in the saliva of clozapine users.
To assess the correlation between plasma and saliva samples, it is preferred to construct full concentration time curves for both saliva and plasma samples.
Based on these curves, the plasma to saliva ratio can be determined [36].
Studies lacking information regarding pharmacokinetic altering comorbidities [26,27,29,30,31,32,33,34], smoking behavior [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34], and interacting co‐medication [26,27,29,30,31,32,33,34] might introduce bias, as they can potentially alter the clozapine concentrations in plasma or saliva.
Whereas most studies measured single samples, one study analyzed clozapine's AUC in saliva, which gives more accurate information on clozapine's pharmacokinetics in saliva.
Even though the collection of saliva was considered easy, the different methods of saliva collection had their own advantages and challenges.
For example, Quantisal was thought to be one of the best collection devices available [37].
Nevertheless, one of the included studies observed a high variability in the amount of collected saliva [29].
The author explained that this happened because it was not possible to wait for the indicator to turn blue or to use a fixed collection time.
Another study compared the Oral‐Eze device with the GBO device [26].
The GBO device had two disadvantages.
First, patients did not like the taste of the solution they had to hold in their mouth; and second, some patients swallowed this solution.
Therefore, patients preferred the Oral‐Eze system.
The biggest disadvantage of the Oral‐Eze system was the variation in the amount of collected saliva, which was also demonstrated by the Quantisal device.
This was the result of an inaccurate volume indicator [26].
Two studies used Salivettes for the collection of saliva [28,34]; unfortunately, they did not describe how patients experienced this collection technique.
Although both studies did analyze the extraction recovery, it is not clear whether the collection and extraction from the Salivettes was included in this analysis.
The studies that used the spitting or drooling method did not mention how users experienced the collection of saliva, nor did they analyze if adhesions of clozapine to the collection tube occurred [27,31,32,33].
The adhesion of clozapine to the collection device might impact its quantification, and with that, also the plasma/saliva ratio.
Moreover, data show that some molecules can interfere with the solution present in collection devices due to additives and a low pH [38].
This can also contribute to a shifted plasma to saliva ratio and should therefore be considered carefully.
None of the included studies mentioned anything about hypersalivation or drugs to reduce hypersalivation.
All studies described a validated method of detection.
The method with the lowest LLOQ was solid‐phase extraction combined with LC–MS/MS [28].
The observed LLOQ's of clozapine, N‐desmethylclozapine, and clozapine‐N‐oxide were 0.1, 0.1, and 0.5 ng/mL, respectively.
A study that used SPE combined with GC/MS/MS found a LLOQ of 10 ng/mL [27].
However, they were not able to quantify two samples, indicating that a LLOQ of 10 ng/mL might not be sufficient for the TDM of clozapine in saliva.
Because clozapine samples have to be sent to a specialized lab for analysis, turnaround times are relatively high [23].
Several initiatives aim to improve access to testing with a quick turnaround time, for example, the development of point‐of‐care testing devices [39].
The feasibility of saliva for the TDM of clozapine depends on the saliva to plasma ratio and on variables like saliva pH, salivary flow, and interacting co‐medication [27,33].
Nevertheless, no study found a good correlation between the clozapine concentrations in saliva and plasma [26,29,31,33].
This might be caused by a low number of samples and the lack of an AUC‐based comparison [26,27,29,31,33].
Moreover, ratio reporting was inconsistent as Patteet et al. [29] reported a saliva/plasma ratio rather than a plasma/saliva ratio; this makes it difficult to compare these values to the other ratios.
Due to the limited availability of raw data, it was not possible to convert these values to a plasma/saliva ratio.
Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling is needed for the validation of saliva as a clozapine TDM specimen.
Moreover, a high inter‐patient variation in saliva pH and salivary flow makes it challenging to assess the correlation between plasma and saliva concentrations of clozapine [27,33].
It is important to further investigate what impact these factors have on the plasma to saliva ratio.
This would allow us to correct for these factors or take these factors into account when interpreting results.
One study focused on the pharmacokinetics of clozapine together with its two metabolites in saliva [28].
They observed higher clozapine saliva concentrations compared to its metabolites.
This can be explained by the higher lipophilicity of the drug, which makes it easier to pass through the lipid‐based capillary membranes of the saliva glands.
The observed Tmax at 4.53 ± 3.61 h (range: 0.50–12.00 h) for clozapine shows that there might be a small delay in the penetration of clozapine in saliva, as plasma Tmax of clozapine is found around 2.5 h [40].
The clozapine t ½ in saliva of 53.58 ± 52.28 h (range: 8.65–226.35 h) is higher compared to its half‐life in plasma, which is around 12 h [40].
This can also be the result of the delayed penetration of clozapine in saliva.
This suggests that saliva levels closer to the trough concentration are better in predicting the plasma concentration.
A previous study has found this for fluconazole as well [41].
Moreover, clozapine is metabolized by the liver [42] which means that clozapine would need to be distributed back to plasma to be metabolized.
This can result in a longer half‐life of clozapine in saliva.
According to the observed stability, saliva is an easy‐to‐use specimen for clozapine TDM.
Samples can be stored for at least 2 months when stored at −21°C [33].
When prepared in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid, deionized water, or the buffers provided by the manufacturers of the Oral‐Eze device or the GBO device, clozapine is even stable for up to 6 months at −21°C [26].
When storage at 4°C is preferred, a clozapine saliva sample is stable for at least 7 days when stored in the Quantisal buffer solution [29].
Even though longer storage periods at 4°C are not studied by the included articles, other stability studies found that clozapine is stable at 4°C for at least 28 days when stored at a low concentration of ascorbic acid and in the absence of light [43].
At room temperature, a clozapine saliva sample is stable for at least 24 h [32].
Taking into account that samples used for TDM are normally analyzed as quickly as possible, these analyzed storage periods are long enough to cover the time of collection to the time of analysis of the clozapine saliva TDM sample.
A limitation of this review was that no validated risk of bias assessment tool was available.
Therefore, we considered only essential components to assess the risk of bias.
Nevertheless, using a validated tool would be more reliable.
Another limitation was the heterogeneity of the data; this made a robust data analysis impossible.
However, this review provides a valuable overview of available data on clozapine pharmacokinetics in saliva.
In this review, we assessed the feasibility of saliva as a specimen for the TDM of clozapine.
Saliva collection for clozapine TDM was considered easy compared to blood sampling.
Moreover, clozapine is stable in saliva for up to 6 months, and all included articles were able to detect clozapine in saliva.
However, a correlation between saliva and plasma clozapine levels was not observed, perhaps due to limited available data.
Although saliva is a promising specimen for the TDM of clozapine, further clinical validation studies are needed to assess whether saliva sampling can replace blood sampling for TDM.
