Suboptimal adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) limits its global impact, with current evidence mostly from the Global North and lacking Global South perspectives.
This meta-analysis synthesizes the rates and determinants of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM) in both regions.
We searched for literature describing PrEP adherence and its determinants among MSM globally up until October 2024 to conduct a meta-analysis on the rate and determinants of suboptimal adherence in both regions.
The definition of (sub-)optimal adherence was study based.
We included 82 studies in the meta-analysis, with 24, 53, and 5 stemmed from the Global South, North, and global multicenter studies, respectively.
Oral PrEP suboptimal adherence is prevalent among MSM PrEP users globally (rate = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28 to 0.38) with a significantly higher rate (P= 0.021) in the Global South (rate = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.50) than in the Global North (rate = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35).
In the Global South, older age (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.87), alcohol use (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.60), and presenting depressive symptoms (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.16) were associated with suboptimal adherence.
In the Global North, MSM self-identified as Black (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.31 to 3.95) or Other (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.81), having a university degree (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.73), and presenting depressive symptoms (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.35 to 3.78) were associated with suboptimal adherence.
On-demand PrEP users globally demonstrated a higher likelihood of suboptimal adherence (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.14).
Suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP is prevalent among MSM globally, particularly higher in the Global South.
Regional differences in determinants highlight the need for tailored interventions.
Tailored interventions are required to address mental health with tailored efforts to younger MSM in the Global South, while interventions in the Global North should be tailored to specific subgroups.
Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown highly effective in preventing HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), whether taken daily or on-demand.1,2However, recent findings have highlighted that the real-world effectiveness of oral PrEP among MSM is highly dependent on adherence.
When PrEP use adherence levels drop <75%, its efficacy decreases substantially from 93% to 69%.3Consequently, suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP has been identified as a key contributing factor to HIV infections.
Suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP is, however, common among PrEP users.
A recent meta-analysis summarized that 38% of oral PrEP users (including heterosexual men and women alongside MSM) reported suboptimal adherence within 6 months of oral PrEP initiation.
Yet, this meta-analysis did not provide a specific estimation for MSM.4Given MSM are the main target population for PrEP in most countries, MSM-specific data on PrEP adherence are warranted and are important to inform PrEP-targeting decisions and intervention design.
In addition, previous systematic reviews have identified various factors associated with suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM, such as age, alcohol or substance use, forgetfulness, disruptions in routine, and HIV-related stigma.5–7However, these existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews have predominantly relied on research conducted in the Global North (usually comprising northern American, European countries, Israel, Japan, and South Korea), with limited representation from the Global South (usually referring to the rest of the countries other than the listed Global North countries8).
Only 1 included study9in the 3 systematic reviews, and 2 out of 24 included studies10,11in the meta-analysis were conducted in the Global South among MSM.
This lack of representation of the Global South in previous research syntheses highlights a relevant information gap between the global regions that cannot be overlooked.
Given the higher number of new HIV infections among MSM reported in the Global South,12and different health care settings and attitudes toward MSM and HIV prevention, determinants of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM may be different in the Global South compared with the Global North.
Taken together, to support The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS's Ending Inequalities initiative13and the goal of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030,14comprehensive global and regional data on determinants associated with suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM are crucial.
Therefore, this study presents an updated global meta-analysis aiming to further investigate and compare the rate and determinants of suboptimal adherence with oral PrEP among MSM between the Global South and Global North.
This meta-analysis is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement (see Appendix S1, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C449),15and is preregistered (PROSPERO, ref. CRD42022357439).
We selected relevant studies published before November 22, 2024, by searching PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EMBASE by combining terms (see Appendix S2, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C449) for the population (MSM), the intervention (oral PrEP use), and the outcome (suboptimal adherence).
We also reviewed the references of other relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses to ensure the comprehensive nature of the synthesis presented.
For all studies included, the following data were extracted: number of participants, recruitment method (if reported), country of study, data collection period, study design, data on reported outcomes of interest, and the definitions and measurements of PrEP (sub-)optimal adherence (Table1).
Given that the directions of reported outcomes included both “optimal” and “suboptimal” adherence, assuming a binary nature of adherence (optimal vs. suboptimal) to oral PrEP among MSM, we first converted the direction of the outcome to “suboptimal adherence” based on the reported effect size and their standard error, because “suboptimal” adherence is the key interest of this study.
In addition, owing to the very heterogeneous reporting of adherence to PrEP, the definitions of (sub-)optimal adherence were driven by the selected studies without a harmonized definition.
We included the adherence definitions as a note instead of including them as a covariate to examine the impacts because of the definition quantitatively given the limited power.
However, we further coded the adherence measurements into nonclinically measured adherence (ie, self-reported missing pills per week/month, or pill counting by researchers, whereas the definitions of optimal adherence vary and were very heterogeneous) and clinically measured adherence (ie, measuring tenofovir concentrations in blood plasma, where a >700/719 fmol/punch is usually considered to be a preventive concentration, representing an optimal adherence to PrEP18).

First, we extracted the absolute number of MSM who had suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP and the total number of PrEP users from the selected studies.
We then grouped data by the geolocation of the included studies into “Global South” and “Global North” using the country/region defined by the United Nations.8In terms of multicenter studies, data were further divided into “Global South” and “Global North” based on the single country data.
When different time frames of study duration were available, the longest available time frame was collected and included as a note.
When adherence data were reported for both daily and on-demand PrEP, we extracted the absolute number of MSM who had suboptimal adherence and the total number of daily/on-demand PrEP users separately.
We recalculated the rate of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM in the Global South, the Global North, and on the global level through our meta-analysis, instead of extracting the original proportion reported in the included studies.
Next, we compared the difference in the rate of suboptimal adherence with oral PrEP among MSM between the Global South and the Global North.
Finally, we also explored the potential impact of nonclinically measured adherence on the reported PrEP adherence.
To provide meta-analytical evidence for the identified determinants of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM through qualitative synthesis, we conducted pooled analyses based on the adjusted effect size (odds ratio [OR]) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the quantitative studies from the qualitative synthesis.
Similar to the pooled rate estimations, we grouped data by the geolocation of the included studies into “Global South” and “Global North”.
Finally, we evaluated the pooled effect by geolocations and on the global level by default when at least 2 studies were available per determinant per geolocation.
For all meta-analyses, we used a random-effects model and the DerSimonian–Laird method to estimate the model on the proportion (rate of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP) or a log-OR scale (determinants of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP).
The DerSimonian–LairdQtest andI2values were used to assess heterogeneity, with low, moderate, and high heterogeneity corresponding toI2values of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively.
In addition, heterogeneity τ was assessed in this study.
To compare the difference in the rate of suboptimal adherence with oral PrEP among MSM, we fit a univariable meta-regression model with geolocation as the covariate.
To explore the impact of adherence measurement methods, we further fit a univariable meta-regression model with adherence measurement as the covariate.
Statistical significance was assessed atP< 0.05.
Publication bias was accessed by inspecting funnel plots using a rank correction test.
The statistical analysis was performed using R (v4.3.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
The search strategy identified 3148 studies after removing duplicates.
We excluded 2107 studies after screening the titles and abstracts.
In total, 392 studies remained for full-text screening, and 310 studies were excluded, leaving 82 studies to be included in the meta-analysis.

Of the 82 studies included in the meta-analysis, 5 were global multicenter studies, 24 stemmed from the Global South, 53 stemmed from the Global North, of which 39 came from the United States alone (see Appendix Table S3 for the summary of included studies, and Appendix Table S13 for the list of countries and the number of included studies per country, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C449).
Quality assessments were summarized in Appendix S4, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C449.
There was no evidence of a publication bias in this study (see Appendix Figure S12, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C449).
Figure2presents the pooled rate of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM globally and by geolocation.
MSM from the Global South had a higher pooled estimated rate of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP (pooled rate = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.50, τ2=0.05, I2= 99.50%) than MSM from the Global North (pooled rate = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35, τ2=0.04, I2= 98.70%), with a global pooled rate of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.38, τ2=0.05, I2= 99.27%).
In the univariable meta-regression of geolocation, this higher pooled rate in the Global South than in the Global North was confirmed (P= 0.021).
Our univariable meta-regression of adherence measurements did not support a significant difference in suboptimal adherence rate between nonclinically and clinically measured rate (P= 0.550).

Our determinantal meta-analysis identified both sociodemographic and behavioral/psychosocial determinants that are associated with a higher level of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP on a global level, with differences by global geolocations (Table1).
No global sociodemographic determinants were identified.
In the Global South, only MSM older than 35 years (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.89, τ2=0.00, I2= 1.2%) were identified to be associated with lower odds of reporting suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP.
In the Global North, instead of age, MSM's ethnicity and education were found to be associated with suboptimal oral PrEP adherence.
Compared with MSM identified as White, MSM identified as Black (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.31 to 3.95, τ2=0.29, I2= 61.10%) or self-identified as Other (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1,81, τ2=0.00, I2= 0.00%) were found to have a significantly higher odds of suboptimal adherence in the Global North.
Given most studies included in this meta-analysis were conducted in the United States, we further explored this association in a US-only context, but the associations had similar strengths.
In United States, compared with MSM identified as White, MSM identified as Black (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.23 to 4.54, τ2=0.37, I2= 67.40%) or self-identified as Other (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.06, τ2=0.00, I2= 0.00%) were estimated to have a significantly higher odds of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP (see Appendix S11, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C449).
Furthermore, in the Global North, compared with MSM with a high school or lower education diploma, MSM with university/college-level education (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.73, τ2=0.08, I2= 29.1%) have significantly lower odds to adhere suboptimally to oral PrEP (Table1).
Global behavioral and psychosocial determinants were identified.
Globally, MSM who had a higher alcohol use level (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.58, τ2=0.00, I2= 0.00%), presenting depressive symptoms (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.30 to 2.52, τ2=0.02, I2= 10.60%), and using on-demand PrEP (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.14, τ2=0.06, I2= 56.20%) were found to be associated with higher odds of suboptimal adherence.
All of these global determinants (a higher alcohol use level (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.60, τ2=0.00, I2= 0.00%), presenting depressive symptoms (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.16, τ2=0.00, I2= 0.00%), and using on-demand PrEP (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.32, τ2=0.09, I2= 66.30%)) were identified in the Global South.
Only presenting depressive symptoms (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.35 to 3.78, τ2=0.00, I2= 0.00%) was identified in the Global North (Table1).
To our knowledge, no prior investigation has estimated the rates or determinants of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM with a dedicated focus on the Global South for comprehensive global comparison.
Globally, based on the selected studies, our findings revealed a concerningly high rate of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM (33%), especially given the decreased real-world effectiveness.3This was lower than the estimate generated in the previous meta-analysis (42%) based on 24 studies.
However, this difference would be expected considering that also heterosexual men and women were included4and oral PrEP adherence has been reported to be lower in these groups.19With the rates derived from our MSM-focused meta-analysis, we can make more specific recommendations to reduce suboptimal adherence among MSM, globally and regionally.
More importantly, our findings indicated significant global disparities in suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM, with a significantly higher rate (12% higher) estimated in the Global South than in the Global North.
There are a few reasons that can explain this.
First, the prerequisite for adherence is access.20Compared with MSM in the Global North, MSM in the Global South frequently grapple with more limited access and availability of PrEP,21owing to factors such as costs, restricted health care infrastructure, and regulatory barriers.20This impedes individuals in obtaining and adhering to the medication.
Second, MSM in the Global South may encounter higher levels of stigma and/or homophobia than MSM in the Global North,22,23potentially discouraging open discussions about their PrEP needs and seeking related assistance.24Third, despite the increasing awareness of PrEP globally, PrEP awareness and related education are less prevalent in the Global South context,25making it more challenging to maintain optimal adherence.
Taken together, a lower adherence level in the Global South was synthesized in our study.
This meta-analysis also provides insights into individual-level determinants and unique regional challenges associated with suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM.
In line with the previous systematic reviews,5–7our meta-analysis corroborates that age, alcohol use, and having depressive symptoms are associated with a higher likelihood of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM, extending these associations also to the Global South context.
In addition, our study provides meta-analytical evidence that suboptimal PrEP adherence is more prevalent among MSM who identify as racial minorities and those with lower education in the Global North, especially within the US context, for the first time.
A similar “lack of access” pathway as discussed for the Global South20may also explain these findings, not only the PrEP medication/prescription, but the argument may also be extended to adherence maintaining programs or other interventions/educations that promote PrEP use adherence.
Marginalized subgroups of MSM are significantly less likely to receive/use PrEP, and maintain an optimal PrEP use compared with other MSM majority groups, in the Global North, especially in the US context.26–29These findings thus underscore existing inequalities within MSM populations in the Global North in terms of PrEP adherence, especially impede burdens among marginalized populations.
Although on-demand PrEP has been suggested to have similar efficacy to daily PrEP in clinical studies,2and offers potential benefits such as increased uptake, adherence, fewer doses, and cost savings,30,31our findings reveal the opposite in terms of use adherence.
MSM using on-demand PrEP showed a higher likelihood of suboptimal adherence, particularly in the Global South, consistent with examples from Belgium and the Netherlands.32–34This could be attributed to the regimen's requirement for planned sexual activity and a more intricate dosing schedule (2-1-1 schedule35) compared with the daily PrEP.
However, sexual encounters among MSM are often less planned,36making adherence to the on-demand dosing schedule challenging,30leading to the higher estimated likelihood of suboptimal adherence.
We acknowledge that our study's definitions of optimal or suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP lack precision and may not directly reflect a link with lower effectiveness.
This may be particularly relevant for studies that measured adherence based on various self-reported pill counts.
The heterogeneity in definitions and measurements derived from the included studies may introduce limitations to our pooled estimates and comparability of findings.
Nevertheless, our univariable meta-regression analysis, focusing on clinically measured vs. nonclinically measured adherence, did not reveal a significant difference in reported adherence.
This aligns with the findings from the previous meta-analysis, supporting the notion that MSM's self-reported history of PrEP use could serve as a convenient and affordable approximation to measure adherence effectively.4In addition, assuming a binary nature of PrEP adherence (optimal vs. suboptimal) may not fully capture the HIV infection risk continuum among PrEP users.37Our meta-analytical estimates may thus potentially overestimate the actual risk of HIV among MSM, because suboptimal adherence does not necessarily correlate with higher risk if alternative prevention methods such as condoms or treatment as prevention (TasP38) are used.
In addition to the previously discussed limitation regarding the heterogeneity in definitions and measurements of PrEP suboptimal adherence, there are several other important limitations in our study.
First, our selected studies included different time/measurement periods for suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM.
This may pose challenges in distinguishing between temporal suboptimal adherers (resulting from lower sexual activity or fewer sexual partners during specific periods) and consistent suboptimal adherers (MSM who always adhere to oral PrEP suboptimally), because temporal suboptimal adherence may not necessarily indicate a higher risk of HIV infection.
Second, the potential inclusion of transgender individuals is another limitation, because some studies did not report disaggregated data for MSM and transgender individuals.
Although the proportion of transgender individuals in our meta-analysis was small, caution should be exercised when generalizing the findings to transgender populations.
Third, our meta-analytical estimates need to be interpreted with caution to adolescents or minor populations, because this population was excluded from this study.
Given a trend of PrEP extension to this population,16future synthesis is thus required to explore the epidemiology of PrEP adherence among this subpopulation of MSM.
In conclusion, our global systematic review and meta-analysis reveal the pervasive issue of suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP among MSM globally, emphasizing a significantly higher rate in the Global South than in the Global North.
For the first time, we provide meta-analytical evidence pinpointing determinants associated with suboptimal adherence, calling for global efforts on prioritized tailoring interventions tailored to MSM PrEP users, especially those who use on-demand PrEP.
Our study also underscores the need for nuanced interventions, addressing risk behaviors and mental health among MSM in the Global South, and targeting more efficiently marginalized populations, especially for MSM who identify as racial minorities, and show lower education levels.
The latter 2 are particularly relevant in the Global North and in the US contexts.
Recognizing global disparities and inequalities in PrEP adherence, we advocate for region-specific interventions, improved health care support, and a reduction in disparities to enhance adherence, ensuring equitable benefits from PrEP as a pivotal HIV prevention strategy and contributing to the global effort to end the HIV epidemic.
