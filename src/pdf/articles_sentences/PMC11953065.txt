To investigate campaigns developed for the dissemination of clinical practice guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging for low back pain.
A scoping review was conducted to identify resources which report on dissemination strategies for low back pain imaging clinical practice guidelines.
A database search was conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Reviews, Scopus, Google, Google Scholar and National Health Service Websites.
The full text of relevant resources identified from the title and abstract screen were retrieved and assessed for inclusion eligibility.
The initial search identified 1087 resources.
Following a title, abstract and full‐text screen, 26 resources were included for final synthesis.
Relevant data were extracted and categorised into the following three key components: (1). Location of the campaign, (2). Campaign details, (3). Dissemination strategies as defined by five methods (educational resources, presentations and interactive interventions, media form, clinical decision support, and other).
Educational resources and interactive interventions were the most commonly used strategies, with media resources implemented the least.
Low back pain imaging clinical practice guidelines have been disseminated to clinicians at regional and national levels; however, there are few international campaigns.
The comprehensive list of dissemination strategies included in this study has created a foundation to facilitate the design of future campaigns to enhance the scope of trialled strategies to consider the complexities of clinical practice and its ever present need to change.
Campaigns promoting LBP imaging guidelines employed diverse methods, including educational resources, workshops, media campaigns, and clinical decision support, but sustaining long‐term behaviour change remains a challenge.
Entrenched habits, cultural norms, and patient expectations drive inappropriate imaging practices, requiring strategies that align with clinicians' values and beliefs while addressing systemic barriers.
Successful strategies from other fields, such as social media campaigns in knee injury management, demonstrate the potential for targeted messaging to shift clinical practices and reduce unnecessary healthcare costs.
Future campaigns could adopt co‐designed interventions to address biases, systemic incentives, and clinician engagement, ensuring better adherence to guidelines and improved patient care.
The overuse of medical imaging for low back pain (LBP) has been well documented in recent literature (Buchbinder et al.2020; Hill et al.2023; Morgan et al.2019) despite clinical practice guidelines recommending its conservative and judicious use (L. Chou et al.2018; Lin et al.2020).
Imaging is regarded as a low‐value investigation for non‐specific LBP, a condition that often lacks an identifiable pathological cause.
Despite this, research indicates that imaging is routinely used in the management of non‐specific low back pain.
This leads to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in response to incidental findings and using healthcare resources without improving patient outcomes (Kjelle et al.2024).
A recent systematic review found that people who received imaging for LBP incurred higher medical costs, used more healthcare services, and required more time off work compared with those who received no imaging (Kjelle et al.2024).
However, despite these findings, and the clear guidance provided by clinical guidelines, there is an exponential growth of imaging in LBP management (Buchbinder et al.2020; Foster et al.2018; Suman et al.2021).
Clinicians encounter several challenges in following clinical practice guidelines for medical imaging for LBP.
A significant barrier is the public perception that imaging is required for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, which creates pressure on clinicians to deviate from guidelines (Buchbinder et al.2020; R. Chou et al.2011; Hall et al.2021; Sharma et al.2020).
Clinicians also have the added concern of potential litigation if they miss rare but serious pathologies such as fractures or malignancies, adding another layer of complexity to guideline adherence (Foster et al.2018; Hall et al.2019; Jenkins et al.2018; Sharma et al.2020; Zhao et al.2024).
Efforts to reduce unnecessary imaging have been the focus of various systematic reviews, many of which have evaluated campaigns aimed at promoting the appropriate use of imaging for LBP (Belavy et al.2022; Jenkins et al.2015; Kovacs et al.2018; Liu et al.2018; Tzortziou Brown et al.2016; Zhao et al.2024).
However, these reviews predominantly focus on outcomes, such as a reduction in imaging rates, rather than on the specific dissemination strategies used to promote adherence to guidelines.
Understanding the strategies that have been used is an important step in identifying the necessary components to drive a sustained behaviour change in clinical practice.
This scoping review aims to explore the dissemination strategies used in campaigns designed to improve the implementation of clinical practice guidelines in imaging for low back pain.
In this review, imaging is defined by the search terms in Table1, including all medical imaging methods relevant to LBP.
This scoping review was informed by the five‐step methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), and refined by Levac et al. (2010), including (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant resources, (3) selecting, (4) charting the data, and (5) collating, summarising, and reporting the results.
To ensure a robust review was conducted, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA) principles were followed (Tricco et al.2018).
We identified key search concepts that reflect the research question and conducted a preliminary search on the MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and Cochrane databases.
The research team discussed the first 10 papers and additional papers of interest identified in a free search.
The search strategy presented in Table1was refined to the following key search areas: imaging, low back pain, dissemination, and clinicians.
The initial search was undertaken in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Reviews, Scopus, Google, Google Scholar and National Health Service Websites for the following countries: the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, Norway, the United States of America, and Denmark (based on our database and Google search results).
The first 100 results from our Google and Google Scholar searches were screened.
One researcher (SH) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of records identified in the initial search for relevance, with a high threshold for abstract screening.
Relevant records were retrieved, and the full text was assessed for inclusion eligibility.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered in the context of the research question to establish an iterative process of resource selection (Arksey and O’Malley2005; Levac et al.2010).
Inclusion criteria were published and grey literature available in English, or clinical guideline dissemination strategies (either as a primary or secondary aim) that informed the appropriate use of imaging for low back pain in national, regional or international campaigns.
Campaigns were eligible for inclusion when directed at health care providers as primary or secondary populations, as long as the data for the health care providers was presented separately.
Resources were excluded when presented as decision aids (e.g. clinical pathways or referral forms, but with no dissemination strategy) were intra‐practice campaigns, individual services, or local strategies.
Campaigns that exclusively targeted the public were also excluded.
Two articles were sent to each author and independently screened for inclusion with reasoning recorded.
The results were discussed, and inclusion criteria refined.
Included resources were reviewed using a two‐phase qualitative content analysis (Arksey and O’Malley2005; Levac et al.2010).
In the initial phase, we extracted information on the study (author, year, country, and location).
The second phase included a re‐reading of each resource in full and the extraction of the campaign information (campaign name, purpose, population, duration, CPGs referenced, dissemination strategies, and key message).
The research question and inclusion criteria informed this process.
This data is charted in Table2and used to identify three key components.
The first key component (location) regards the country where the campaign was produced in.
The second key component (campaign details) is directly related to the question and includes population, duration, and the CPGs referenced.
The final key component identified five potential methods of dissemination, including: (1) educational resources (e.g. booklet, poster, infographic, package, video, and website), (2) presentations and interactive interventions (e.g. conference, symposium, webinar, seminar, workshop, training session, and meeting), (3) media form (e.g. press release, newspaper, TV commercial, podcast, and social media), (4) clinical decision support (CDS) (e.g. alert, reminder, and best practice card), and (5) other (e.g. audit, follow‐up, DVD, and feedback).
Use of R‐SCAN among a wide range of US practices resulted in a significant increase in proportion of high‐ value medical imaging cases after its intervention phase.
R‐SCAN participation was also associated with a decrease in the total number of low‐value imaging cases.

This step involved the synthesis of all extracted information to present a comprehensive record of strategies that have disseminated LBP imaging CPGs (Arksey and O’Malley2005; Levac et al.2010).
The synthesised findings informed the summary and implications of this study.
This scoping review did not require ethical approval.
The search was completed by February 2024.
Details of the database and grey literature searches and the screening process are shown in Figure1.
The initial database search identified 1013 resources, and 74 were identified from the grey literature, making a total of 1087.
Following the screening of the inclusion criteria, six additional resources were identified from a hand search of included systematic reviews, resulting in 26 resources included for the final synthesis.
Two articles were discussed prior to being excluded as their selection status was initially inconclusive and required cross‐checking.
The campaigns included were conducted in Canada (n= 3) (Ammendolia et al.2004; Cheng et al.2017; Khoury et al.2019), Australia (n= 7) (Buchbinder and Jolley2007; Coombs et al.2021; French et al.2013,2022; Jenkins, French, et al.2022; Jenkins, French, et al.2022; Morgan et al.2019), United States of America (n= 5) (Rezaii et al.2020; Schectman et al.2003; K. Y. Wang et al.2018,2021; Zafar et al.2019), United Kingdom (n= 7) (Buchbinder et al.2020; Dey et al.2004; Eccles et al.2001; Kerry et al.2000; Matowe et al.2002; Oakeshott et al.1994; Robling et al.2002), Netherlands (n= 1) (Suman et al.2018) and Sweden (n= 1) (Schröder2021).
Refer to Table2for further details.
Twenty‐four campaigns were identified in the 26 included resources.
Of the 24 campaigns, 15 campaigns targeted clinicians only.
Nine campaigns targeted clinicians and the public.
Refer to Table2for further details.
Eleven campaigns were one‐time strategies, providing a solitary contact point with the CPG resources or workshops.
Thirteen campaigns were sustained dissemination strategies, providing multiple contact points across time, including follow‐up calls or workshops.
Refer to Table2for further details.
The CPGs disseminated in these campaigns were the National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines 2003 (n= 1), Choosing Wisely (CW) (n= 5), American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (n= 3), Dutch Chain Care Guideline for non‐specific LBP Complaints (n= 2), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (n= 3), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Guidelines 2003 (n= 1), American College of Physicians (ACP) (n= 6), Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Guidelines (n= 2), Danish National Clinical Guidelines for non‐surgical treatment of LBP (n= 2), The Back Book UK 1996 (n= 1), Australian Acute Musculoskeletal Pain Guidelines 2003 (n= 1), and UK Royal College of Radiologists (n= 5).
The most referenced CPGs were ACP, CW, and the UK Royal College of Radiologists.
Additional CPGs were included in three campaigns; however, they were unable to be identified (Ammendolia et al.2004; Coombs et al.2021; Schectman et al.2003).
Refer to Table2for further details.
Multiple dissemination strategies were implemented by the 24 campaigns.
Two campaigns used a single method of dissemination through educational resources (Khoury et al.2019), and an interactive intervention (Cheng et al.2017).
The remaining 22 campaigns used multiple strategies to disseminate their selected CPGs.
No dissemination strategies included disincentives for inappropriate imaging.
Three studies looked at merit‐based incentive schemes providing payments for following CPGs for imaging (Rezaii et al.2020; K. Y. Wang et al.2018,2021).
Refer to Table2for further details.
Educational resources were the most common dissemination strategy used by 18 of the 24 campaigns (75%).
This included pamphlets (n= 2), booklets (n= 2), posters in practices and departments (n= 2), and infographics (n= 1).
A copy of CPGs or recommendations was used in 10 campaigns, with the majority being distributed by mail.
Four campaigns implemented educational packages made up of multiple resources and one campaign used educational videos.
Five campaigns used a website to provide access to CPGs and additional educational resources.
Refer to Table2for further details.
The different forms of presentations and interactive interventions identified come under audio‐visual presentations and were employed by 15 campaigns (62.5%).
Presentations refer to strategies where information was communicated to an audience of clinicians, and were used in four campaigns (16.7%), including a presentation and webinar (n= 1), seminar (n= 1), conference (n= 1), and a symposium (n= 1).
Interactive interventions were strategies where clinicians engaged with campaign facilitators; these were used in 11 (46%) campaigns.
This included learning sessions (n= 2), meetings (n= 2), feedback sessions (n= 1), workshops (n= 3), and training sessions (n= 5).
Refer to Table2for further details.
Dissemination through media was the least commonly employed strategy.
Four campaigns (16.7%) distributed their relevant CPGs through a variety of media outlets, targeting the public and clinicians.
These included social media, television commercials, newspapers, press releases, and a podcast.
Refer to Table2for specific campaign details.
Five campaigns (20.8%) used Clinical decision support (CDSs), which are defined as CPG informed strategies that guide clinicians' decision making when ordering imaging for LBP.
Two campaigns used undefined CDSs (Coombs et al.2021; Morgan et al.2019), with the remaining three campaigns utilising alerts (Zafar et al.2019), reminders (Eccles et al.2001), and best practice cards (K. Y. Wang et al.2021).
The alerts and reminders were programmed into clinical software, producing CPG recommendations during assessment reporting and imaging referrals.
Feedback, audits, follow‐ups and DVD recordings were the additional dissemination strategies identified in 11 campaigns (46%) that did not fit the method categories.
They include feedback on referral patterns and behaviour (n= 7), audits of images ordered (n= 5), follow‐ups on clinicians attending in‐person interventions (n= 3) and DVD recordings from workshops and conferences (n= 2).
Refer to Table2for further details.
This review analysed campaigns developed to disseminate clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the appropriate use of imaging for LBP.
We found many strategies for disseminating CPGs; however, the ongoing overuse of medical imaging for low back pain (LBP) suggests there is a significant gap in their designs, potentially limiting their effective implementation (Buchbinder et al.2020; Hill et al.2023; Morgan et al.2019).
There were 24 campaigns conducted regionally and nationally that used a range of dissemination methods.
These methods were categorised into educational resources, presentations and interactive interventions, media campaigns, clinical decision support tools, and other strategies which do not fit the methods identified (feedback, audio follow‐up and DVD).
A notable aspect of these campaigns is the diversity and combination of dissemination methods used and their differing roles.
Educational resources, such as brochures and online modules, were central in raising public awareness about clinical guidelines (Zhao et al.2024).
Presentations and interactive workshops reinforced this knowledge through direct engagement with healthcare professionals.
Media campaigns and clinical decision support tools were often tailored to address specific barriers faced by clinicians.
For example, Zhao et al. (2024)​ demonstrated some evidence of a short‐term reduction of routine imaging (less than 12 months) following the use of educational resources.
However, these changes were not sustained beyond 12 months, possibly due to broader contextual and systemic factors.
While educational resources are pivotal, their impact is limited without complementary strategies that address the diverse barriers clinicians face (Belavy et al.2022; Jenkins et al.2015; Kovacs et al.2018; Liu et al.2018; Tzortziou Brown et al.2016).
Successful campaigns in other clinical domains provide valuable insights.
It may be beneficial to reflect on other areas of health practice where a change in clinical behaviour has improved patient outcomes.
There has been a significant shift to more prudent and appropriate management of knee injury with an increase in meniscal repair rather than meniscectomy, reflecting an increased awareness of long‐term consequences (Bansal et al.2021; Bhan2020).
The phrase ‘save the meniscus’ has been widely used in research and social media postings (Ponkilainen et al.2023).
This example highlights how a social media campaign improved clinical practice and reduced unnecessary healthcare spending.
Adapting strategies similar to LBP imaging campaigns could amplify their reach and impact.
Educational resources, targeted messaging, and interprofessional collaboration may be key to shifting imaging behaviour (Y. X. J. Wáng et al.2018).
However, this is complicated by the many factors that influence clinicians' imaging decisions (Tanner et al.2024).
The persistence of inappropriate imaging practices may stem from competing interests and established cultural norms within healthcare settings.
Financial incentives, professional biases, and entrenched practices can create resistance to change, making it difficult to align clinician behaviour with guideline recommendations.
Effective dissemination strategies to change clinician imaging behaviour must address these underlying cultural and systemic barriers.
Using a co‐design methodology has successfully driven dissemination strategies in healthcare service improvement by incorporating the knowledge and experience of clinicians to create behaviour change (Fylan et al.2021).
By integrating clinicians' perspectives and addressing systemic barriers, campaigns can foster an environment conducive to sustainable behaviour change.
Additionally, introducing financial disincentives for inappropriate imaging could further encourage adherence to clinical guidelines.
This was the first review to provide a comprehensive overview of dissemination strategies of clinical practice guidelines in the context of imaging for LBP and identify opportunities for future research.
A key strength of this review is that it was conducted by a team of active clinicians and researchers.
One limitation is the difficulty of linking specific campaigns with their corresponding clinical guidelines.
Campaigns were excluded if they did not refer to specific dissemination campaigns which included guidelines such as Choosing Wisely, as it was unclear whether they had been promoted using targeted campaigns.
This study identified a wide range of strategies used in campaigns disseminating imaging guidelines for low back pain.
However, bridging the gap between evidence‐based practice and clinical behaviour remains a challenge, with reported changes often being short‐term despite a wide range of strategies used.
Addressing the underlying issues that drive the continued use of inappropriate imaging needs to ensure messaging aligns with clinicians' values and beliefs.
This may also require consideration of broader strategies such as implementing disincentives for inappropriate imaging and adopting co‐design principles to prioritise systemic and cultural barriers in the development of targeted resources.
