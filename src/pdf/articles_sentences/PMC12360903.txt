This miracle, widely interpreted as a sacred act of healing, has been depicted in religious art for centuries.9,10Among these visual representations, a particular 13th-century illustration caught our attention due to its striking anatomical inconsistency (Fig. 1A).
In the image, the saints are shown amputating the verger’s right leg while transplanting a left leg.
The mismatch in laterality is unmistakable: the curvature of the medial longitudinal arch and the positioning of the toes clearly reveal whether the leg is left or right, making the discrepancy apparent even to viewers without anatomical expertise.
To clarify this discrepancy, we digitally outlined (Fig. 1B) and color-coded the original image (Fig. 1C).
Our annotated version highlights the amputated leg in yellow, the transplanted leg in black, and the blanket in blue (Fig. 1C).
This confirms that a left leg is being attached, while the amputated right leg lies on the floor.
We also created a redrawn version to show correct anatomical alignment, based on the curvature of the medial longitudinal arch and the positioning of the toes (Fig. 1D).
This anatomical inaccuracy becomes even more evident when compared to a contemporaneous illustration, such as one depicting a sick person lying before the Caladrius bird (Fig. 2A).
An enlarged view of the feet confirms the anatomically correct laterality, particularly in the orientation of the toes (Fig. 2B).
Therefore, unlike the saints’ depicted error (Fig. 1A), the Caladrius bird illustration suggests that such visual inconsistencies were not typical of artistic representations from the period.
Notably, laterality error is also apparent in later artworks, including a 16th-century painting by Bartolomeo Ramenghi, which similarly exhibits a lateral mismatch between the amputated and transplanted legs.11Whether these inaccuracies arose from artistic oversight, limited anatomical knowledge due to restricted access to cadavers, or deliberate symbolic intent (such as spiritual associations with the left side) remains unclear.
Medical education plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges, integrating foundational knowledge, procedural skills, teamwork, and awareness of cognitive and systemic biases.14Incorporating artworks into this education provides a compelling pedagogical tool, fostering emotional engagement and critical reflection on human vulnerability in medical practice.
By promoting open communication and professional resilience, our findings contribute to transforming discussions of error into opportunities for establishing trust.
Our analysis, therefore, illustrates how artistic narratives can serve as valuable resources for medical education and professional discourse.
Similar to Luke Fildes’sThe Doctor, an iconic medical artwork emblematic of compassionate care,15this case helps build trust among physicians, patients, and society.
Ultimately, our findings will reinforce core elements of medical professionalism by encouraging reflection on human fallibility, fostering accountability, and relieving the psychological burden of perfection in clinical practice.
