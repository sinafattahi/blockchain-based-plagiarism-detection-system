As the excavation depth of the tunnel increases, the stress on the surrounding rock increases, and the tunnel becomes fragmented, especially in coal tunnels, which require grouting reinforcement.
Conventional materials are inadequate for the grouting and reinforcing demands of this type of surrounding rock; therefore, it is essential to create grouting materials with specific expansion properties.
First, the orthogonal test method was employed to optimize the expansion grouting materials ratio.
Compared with traditional grouting materials, it exhibits certain expansibility along with good fluidity and strength.
Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the mechanical properties of the material, the optimal formulation was determined as follows: 10% UEA expansive agent, 5% early-strength agent, and 1.2% water-reducing agent.
Additionally, Through SEM tests and grouting reinforcement test of broken coal or rock, it was found that expansive grouting materials can effectively fill micro-fractures in coal rock, enhance the integrity of the surrounding rock, and improve its mechanical properties.
The findings indicate that the recovery strength of coal and rock using expansion grouting materials at 7 days is 0.18 and 0.1 greater than that of pure cement; at 28 days, the recovery strength of coal and rock is 0.27 and 0.15 higher than that of pure cement.
Ultimately, the expansion grouting materials is employed in engineering applications.
Following the application of anchor grouting and expansion grouting materials, the maximum deformation of the roof at the roadway intersection measures 125 mm, while the maximum deformation on both sides reaches 190 mm.
The distortion of the surrounding rock of the roadway is well managed.
This is essential for the reinforcement of tunnels within shattered surrounding rock and for the secure extraction of coal in mines.
The superficial coal reserves in China are progressively depleting, leading to deeper coal mining operations.
The safety of coal mine roadways post-excavation is intimately linked to the fragmentation of surrounding rock as mining depth increases.
The greater the fragmentation of the surrounding rock, the diminished safety of the roadway, and the increased support costs.
In light of the support of coal mine fractured surrounding rock roadways [1–3], scholars have conducted extensive scientific investigations.
Theories and technologies such as loose ring theory, joint support theory [4–6], U-type steel shrinkage support, and anchor cable networks [7–11] have been progressively developed.
The aforementioned has significantly influenced the safety of coal mine roadways.
However, when the surrounding rock of the roadway is relatively loose or fractured, conventional support methods cannot establish a solid bearing system.
Consequently, it is infeasible to avert the emergence of roadway support failures, bottom drum issues, roof subsidence, or other phenomena, which significantly contribute to roadway collapse safety incidents, adversely impacting coal mine productivity.
For this roadway characterized by fractured surrounding rock, therapy is typically administered using Grouting consolidates the fractured surrounding rock [12–17], enhancing its structural integrity and physical-mechanical properties, thereby augmenting its bearing capacity and establishing a dependable foundation for the anchor rod [17–26].
Researchers employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the physical properties of grouting materials through microscopic testing and performance analysis [27–31].
Typically, there is no substantial distinction between the thermal analysis and infrared spectrum analysis of expanded and unexpanded materials.
Nevertheless, the micromorphology of the hydration observed via scanning electron microscopy is markedly distinct [32–36].
The hardening process of conventional Materials exhibits a specific degree of dry shrinkage, leading to a low density in the traditional anchor injection surrounding rock fissures.
This results in a limited enhance Materials of the overall strength of the roadway surrounding rock, making it challenging to establish an effective structure.
This study proposes the use of grouting material with specific expansion properties [37–42] to reinforce the extensive area of fractured roadway, thereby creating an effective and construction.
Due to the low strength and poor fluidity of traditional expansive grouting materials, this study utilized cement, expansion agent, early-strength agent, and water-reducing agent as raw materials to prepare a grouting material with certain expansive properties and adequate strength, employing the orthogonal test method [42–47].
The mechanical properties of the grouting solid were evaluated, and the microstructure was examined and assessed using SEM.
Employ the intersection at the inlet rock gate of -808m phase and the track tunnel of 1304 face as a case study for the actual implementation of the innovative expansion grouting materials.
The monitoring results indicate that the grouting material with certain expansion properties may successfully regulate the deformation of the surrounding rock.
This is essential for the reinforcement of tunnels within shattered surrounding rock and for the secure extraction of coal in mines.
To enhance the strength and fluidity of the grouting material while expansion properties, water-reducing agent and early-strength agent were added to the 425# Portland cement, expansive agent and gypsum.Fig 1illustrates the raw materials utilized in the ratio optimization test of the novel expansion grouting materials.

Additionally observed was the grouting coal body’s cementing surface.
Microscopic analysis of the effect of expansion agent on the structure and characteristics of grouting material follows then.
The paper clarifies and analyzes the link between the physical and mechanical change law and its microstructure by relating the microstructural change with the physical and mechanical properties.
Then one can gain the internal mechanism of the new expansion grouting substance for reinforcing the crushed coal.
The procedure for scanning electron microscope test is illustrated inFig 6.
This physical properties of expansion grouting materials tests aims to obtain the physical properties of grouting materials under different ratios through physical property tests.
The specific method is to select three samples for each ratio in each group of tests, conduct tests on them, and use the average value of the test results of the three samples as the final physical property data for that ratio to improve the accuracy and representativeness of the results.
Assuming there is no interaction between the factors, the results of orthogonal test are shown inTable 3.
Statistical analysis and calculations were conducted on the experimental results of each factor and level.
The range analysis method was employed to investigate the influence of multiple parameters on the slurry properties, clarifying the specific effects of different factors on the physical characteristics of the slurry.

(1) Fluidity: FromTable 3andFig 7a, the fluidity of pure cement is 13 cm.
With the increase of water reducing agent, the fluidity of expansion grouting materials increases gradually.
The fluidity first increases and then decreases with the increase of the expansion agent incorporation.
However, the fluidity changed less with the increase of early strength agent.
According to the range analysis, the effect of the water agent is the most obvious, followed by the expansion agent and the early strong agent.
The maximum fluidity combination of the expansion grouting materials is 10% UEA expansive agent, 4% early-strength agent, and 1.2% water-reducing agent.
(2) Initial setting time:Table 3andFig 7bindicate that the initial setting time of pure cement is 451 minutes.
The introduction of early strength agents progressively reduces the initial setting time of the expansion grouting materials.
As the quantities of the expansion agent and water-reducing agent rose.
The extreme range analysis indicates that the quantity of early strength agent most significantly influences the initial setting time, followed by the water reducer, and lastly the expansion agent.

(3) Expansion rate: As indicated inTable 3andFig 7c, the expansion grouting materials can entirely counteract the shrinkage of pure cement while also generating additional expansion during the hardening phase.
The expansion rate rises with an increase in the expansion agent, albeit at a diminished rate.
Conversely, the expansion rate decreases with an increase in the water agent.
The extreme range analysis indicates that the quantity of expansion agent most significantly influences the expansion rate, followed by the quantity of water-reducing agent and early strength agent.
The optimal combination for the maximum expansion rate of the grouting material is 15% UEA expansive agent, 4% early-strength agent, and 0.4% water-reducing agent.
(4) Expansion Force: According toTable 3andFig 7d, the expansion grouting materials generates a specific expansion force upon hardening.

Exceeding a specific threshold of expansion agent results in the formation of many microcracks, thus diminishing compressive strength.
As the concentration of water reducer increases, the strength initially diminishes before subsequently rising.
The intensity fluctuates minimally with the augmentation of early strength agent integration.
The extreme analysis indicates that the quantity of expansion agent influences the strength of the slurry, succeeded by the water-reducing agent, and ultimately the early strength agent.

Portland cement 425# is expanded with a UEA agent.
The source of expansion is the development and water absorption of calcium alum stone AFt.
The hydration of the UEA expansion agent generates substantial quantities of AFt.
Upon the incorporation of the UEA expansion agent into the cement, it will persist in reacting with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), the hydration byproduct of the cement, to generate additional AFt.
It intertwines with the C-S-H gel, the hydration product of cement, which subsequently induces a sTable volumetric expansion during the cement hardening process.
The examination of microscopic tests primarily focuses on microstructure and phase composition.
Utilize the 28-day sample to examine the microstructure and mechanism of the expansion agent for cement expansion.

The pure cement generates a substantial quantity of cylindrical C-S-H gel material during hydration, hence imparting a degree of strength to the cement.
Upon the addition of a specific quantity of expansion agent, calcium will be produced.
The calcium content will rise with the augmentation of the expansion agent, resulting in a denser consolidated body.
The resultant microcracks proliferate with the augmentation of the expansion agent.
As the micro fracture expands to a specific threshold, it will result in crack propagation, thereby compromising the integrity of the consolidated structure and diminishing the strength.
Consequently, when the quantity of the expansion agent rises, the strength of the grouting material initially increases and subsequently diminishes.
The quantity of the expansion agent must be moderate, yielding a consolidated body strength of 28.53 MPa at 10% and 11.16 MPa at 15%.
The grouting-coal solidity of several grouting materials were enlarged 300 and 600 times in SEM for microscopic imaging.

The coal body, augmented by the expansion grouting materials, exhibits a denser structure, and achieves effective adhesion.
The interface area between the grouting material and the coal body is extensive, resulting in a robust adhesion force.
expansion grouting materials may efficiently occupy the voids in fractured coal bodies, thereby reducing the porosity in the consolidated coal mass.
When the grouting-coal is exposed to pressure and shear stress, friction occurs between the expansion grouting materials and the coal body.
The expansion grouting materials enhances the compressive and shear strength of the coal body, demonstrating its effective reinforcing of the fractured surrounding rock.
During the excavation of the 1304 tracking tunnel at Coal Mine, significant deformation was observed at the intersection of the tunnel and -808m ingate, as illustrated inFig 14.
The surrounding rock is fractured, and the loose ring surpasses the bolt’s anchorage capacity.

The spacing of the grouting cables is 1600 mm × 1600 mm, the spacing of the grouting bolts is 800 mm × 800 mm.
The diameter of the drilling hole is 32 mm.
One measuring station is positioned every 50 meters along the street, resulting in a total of six measuring stations.
The roadway’s surface displacement was quantified over a period of 60 days utilizing the cross-point method.
The monitoring outcomes are presented inTable 4.

Rock grouting reinforcement and support have helped, and the outcome is good.
The filling mechanism of the expansion grouting materials in fractured surrounding rock is illustrated inFig 18.
Initially, the pressure and flow rate of the slurry progressively diminish along the crack’s diffusion direction under the grouting pressure.
Upon attaining the maximum distance within the fissure, the slurry particles are segregated and commence settling.
A cumulative structure progressively develops from the interior towards the exterior in the cleft.
Subsequently, the width of the cumulative structure expands.
Ultimately, when the grouting pressure reaches a sufficient level, the fissures are effectively filled with the slurry.
The expansion grouting materials exerts pressure on the surrounding rock because to its inherent expansion force.
In comparison to pure cement slurry, the expansion grouting materials increases the density of the fractured surrounding rock and the solid, hence enhancing the restoration of triaxial stress.
The expansion grouting materials exhibits certain expansion properties post-consolidation.
Following grouting and strengthening, the cohesiveness and internal friction angle of the coal rock mass are enhanced.
The compaction of the coal or rock mass, enhanced by expansion grouting, increases the total strength of the surrounding rock.
Expansion grouting enhances the strength envelope of the surrounding rock.
The expansion grouting materials possesses certain expansion properties, hence generating support for the fractured surrounding rock.
Following the application of expansion grouting materials, both the maximum and minimum principal stresses within the rock mass will experience an increase to a certain degree.
Consequently, the molar stress circle anchored with the expansion grouting materials is displaced to the right.Fig 19illustrates that the distance between the rock mass strength envelope and the mole grouting circle exceeds that of conventional grouting materials.
Concurrently, the enhancement of mechanical parameters, including the bonding strength of the fractured rock mass, the internal friction angle, and the resistance among the internal rock mass, is more pronounced.
In comparison to conventional grouting materials, expansion grouting materials more effectively enhances the strength and load-bearing capability of surrounding rock.
The expansion grouting materials can infiltrate deeper fissures in the fractured surrounding rock due to the influence of grouting pressure and expansion force.
Upon the condensation of the slurry, a network structure emerges, sustaining the fractured surrounding rock.
Expansion grouting enhances the bonding range of loose rings and reinstates it’s bearing capacity.
The expansion grouting enhances the subsequent expansion of the adjacent rock loose ring.
Consequently, in comparison to conventional grouting materials, the expansion grouting materials is superior in minimizing the extent of the surrounding rock’s loose ring and reinstating the load-bearing capacity.
