Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including altered innate lymphoid cell (ILC) immune responses, particularly during exacerbations (ECOPD).
Baicalin, a natural compound prevalent in various herbal medicines, has shown promise as a therapeutic candidate in ECOPD.
However, its potential and molecular mechanism for addressing ILC immune imbalance during ECOPD remain poorly understood.
First, this study conducted a cross-sectional analysis of ILC immune responses in stable COPD patients and those experiencing exacerbations.
Then, clinical findings of skewed ILC immunity were validated in cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide-induced ECOPD mouse models.
Lastly, the therapeutic effect of baicalin on restoring ILC immune homeostasis was investigated in experimental ECOPD mouse models.
Significant downregulation of ILC2 immunity was observed during COPD exacerbations, accompanied by increased ILC1 and ILC3 responses, particularly in cases associated with bacterial infections.
Notably, elevated IL-22 levels were observed in this group.
Administration of recombinant IL-22 in ECOPD mouse models disrupted lung ILC homeostasis, specifically inhibiting the accumulation of ILC2.
Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses suggested IL-22 as a mediator of type 2 immune suppression by creating a molecular environment that favors type 1 and type 3 immunity.
Treatment with baicalin effectively restored ILC2 immunity by enhancing the recruitment and activation of lung ILC2 while suppressing ILC1 and ILC3 responses.
Importantly, baicalin attenuated IL-22 production from lung ILC3, highlighting its potential as an IL-22 inhibitor.
Baicalin demonstrates potential as a therapeutic strategy for addressing ILC immune imbalance in COPD exacerbations, particularly by restoring ILC2 immunity and partially inhibiting IL-22 production.
Clinical registration The cross-sectional study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100050683).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) stands as an important cause of global health burden and mortality, particularly during exacerbations (ECOPD).
The innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family, crucial for early immune responses and maintaining epithelial integrity, has been implicated in COPD pathophysiology.
Unlike adaptive lymphocytes (e.g., T and B cells) or granulocytes (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils), ILCs act as rapid responders to tissue injury and pathogens, bridging innate and adaptive immunity.
As ILCs exhibit a trait of functional diversity and plasticity [1,2], immune dysfunction or an imbalance between ILC subsets might be induced under different cytokine milieus, contributing to ECOPD [3].
Type 2 immunity exhibits several host-protective functions, including the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis, suppression of excessive type 1 inflammation, regulation of barrier defense, and modulation of tissue regeneration [4].
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 s), along with adaptive Th2 cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, are integral to type 2 immune responses.
While Th2 cells are central drivers of adaptive type 2 immunity through cytokine production, ILC2 s act as innate counterparts that amplify tissue repair and eosinophilic inflammation in response to epithelial-derived alarmins like IL- 33 and IL- 25.
They are pivotal in orchestrating lung immune homeostasis, lung structures repair after injury, and the resolution of cell-mediated inflammation in conditions like COPD [5].
Notably, the frequency of ILC2 s in circulation is lower in COPD patients compared to healthy individuals, correlated with increased disease severity and exacerbation incidence [3].
Consistently, eosinopenia is commonly observed in COPD patients during exacerbation and is associated with poor prognosis and bacterial infection complications [6–9].
Risk factors for COPD exacerbations, such as cigarette smoking (CS) and bacterial infections (e.g.,Staphylococcus aureusand non-typeableH.
influenzae), contribute to ILC2 dysfunction.
These factors downregulate GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), a critical transcription factor for ILC2 differentiation and functional activation, which leads to a phenotype alteration towards the ILC1 subset and silences the ILC2 immunity by inhibiting the production of IL- 5 and IL- 13 [3].
Exposure to these combined risks exacerbates ILC2 inhibition in COPD, while increasing the ILC1 numbers [3].
In parallel, the frequency of ILC1 s and ILC3 s, characterized by the transcription factors of T-bet and retinoic acid receptor‐related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), respectively, correlates with neutrophilic lung inflammation, emphysema, epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition in the lung, and overall disease severity.
This has been linked to an increased risk of exacerbations in COPD patients [3,10–12].
IL- 22 is a member of the IL- 10 ‘family’ and is a Th17-related cytokines, produced by adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells, neutrophils, and innate lymphocytes like γδ T cells and ILC3 s [13].
IL- 22 plays a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, particularly by inhibiting eosinophilic inflammation and type 2 immune responses.
Elevated IL- 22 levels have been observed in allergic respiratory conditions such as asthma [14,15], where it induces the expression of regenerating islet-derived protein 3γ (Reg3γ) through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and suppresses IL- 33, thus inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration and ILC2 activation [16,17].
However, the involvement of IL- 22 in the ILC imbalance in COPD has not been fully discovered.
Baicalin, a flavonoid compound found in various herbal medicines, is known for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.
It has demonstrated effectiveness in treating inflammatory lung diseases, including COPD exacerbations [18–20].
Despite this, the potential impact of baicalin on ILC subsets, especially its role in restoring immune balance during exacerbations, has not been thoroughly investigated.
This study aims to explore whether baicalin can correct ILC imbalance in COPD, potentially offering a novel therapeutic approach for managing exacerbations.

Mice were fixed in specially-made nose-only exposure tubes and exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) (300 mg/m3to 350 mg/m3) for 75 min, twice daily, five days per week, for a total of 12 weeks.
Mice in the control group were exposed to fresh air.
After CS exposure, an atomizing spray of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.2 mg/mL) was administrated through endotracheal intubation after visualizing the glottis through the oral cavity to establish the ECOPD model.
To observe the effect of IL- 22, 50 μL of recombinant mouse IL- 22 (20 μg/mL) or normal saline was administrated through airway intubation 24 h after CS exposure [22,23].
LPS was endotracheally sprayed to induce an acute airway inflammation 24 h post IL- 22 or normal saline treatment.
To evaluate the effect of baicalin in ECOPD mice, 200 μL baicalin dissolved in 3% carboxymethylcellulose sodium was administered intragastrically for consecutive five days to pre-modeled ECOPD mice.
Mice were randomly divided into three baicalin treatment groups: high-dose group (200 mg/kg), medium-dose group (100 mg/kg), and low-dose group (50 mg/kg) [24,25].
Normal saline was used as the control treatment.
Twenty-four hours after intervention, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection and underwent tracheostomy.
Lung function was assessed using a Buxco system (Buxco, Saint Paul, MN, USA) [26].
The system employs invasive plethysmography to measure respiratory mechanics.
Following tracheostomy, mice were connected to the apparatus, and forced maneuvers were performed by applying controlled airway pressures.
Parameters including forced expiratory volume at 20, 50, and 100 ms (FEV20, FEV50, FEV100), forced vital capacity (FVC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and total lung capacity (TLC) were recorded.
These measurements reflect airflow limitation and lung hyperinflation, key pathophysiological features of COPD.
BALF was collected as previously described [26].
Briefly, the left bronchial tubes of mice were ligated, and the right lungs were lavaged three times with 0.5 mL of sterile pre-cooled PBS.
Then, the BALF was centrifuged to pellet the cells, which were resuspended for cell count.
The supernatant was kept at − 80 °C for cytokine analysis.
After washing cell resuspensions with red blood cell lysate and analyzing cellular viability, cells in BALF were calculated.
Cell counts were observed and counted in five randomly selected views per slice by two double-blind evaluators who were unaware of the experimental interventions.
After lavage, the right lung was isolated, stored in a cryopreserved tube, and kept in liquid nitrogen for protein and RNA extraction.
The left lung was fixed in 10% formaldehyde for pathological examination.
For lung tissue homogenate collection, freshly removed lung tissue (20 mg) was homogenized in tropomyosin receptor kinase lysate/β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St.
Louis, Missouri, USA), and the supernatant was stored at − 80 °C for further analyzing.
Fresh lung tissue (20 mg) was immediately crushed and transferred to 2 mL enzyme-free EP tubes containing lysate (PMSF in the lysate was diluted with RIPA lysate at 1:100 volume).
Protein phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixture were added.

Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R6812 - 02, OMEGA, St.Louis, MO, USA).
Single-cell suspensions were rapidly prepared using the lung dissociation kit (130–095–927, Miltenyi Biotec, Köln, Germany) from the remaining lung tissues, after the removal of trachea and connective tissue as much as possible.
Collagenase and DNase were added to dissociate the lung tissue.
Cells were isolated using the gentleMACS™ Dissociator (130–093–235, Miltenyi Biotec, Köln, Germany) and filtered to obtain a single-cell suspension.
To increase the ILCs yield for flow cytometry, the above procedures were processed for pooled lung segments from 5 mice in each group.
Percoll gradient fractionation was used to further separate lymphocytes.
After lysing red blood cells with ammonium chloride solution, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in pre-cooled PMI- 1640 medium (10% FCS, 200 U/mL cyan-streptomycin dual antibodies) to a final concentration of 1.5 × 107cells/mL.
Cells were stained with flow cytometry antibodies to sort or analyze by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Lung tissue ILCs were identified as Lin−CD45+CD127+cells.
ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 were further identified as Lin−CD45+CD127+CD117–Sca- 1+cells, Lin−CD45+CD127+CD117+Sca- 1+KLRG1+cells, and Lin−CD45+CD127+CD117+Sca- 1–cells.

The digest peptides were desalted and separated using IntelliFlow technology on a reversed-phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100, 100 μm × 2 cm, nanoViper C18) maintained at 45 °C.
Chromatographic separation was performed using a 120-min linear gradient from 5 to 40% mobile phase B (mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water; mobile phase B: 0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile) at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min.
The auto-sampler temperature was maintained at 4 °C with an injection volume of 2 μL.
LC–MS/MS analysis was conducted on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an Easy nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Josse, CA) in positive ion mode.
Data were acquired in data-dependent top 10 mode with a scan range of 300 − 1800 m/z and an automatic gain control target of 3 × 106.
The ion transfer tube temperature was set to 275 °C with a spray voltage of 2.1 kV.

The top 20 enriched pathways were visualized in a bubble diagram, where point size indicated the number of annotated genes and color depth represented enrichment significance.
IL- 22-producing ILC3 s (CD3–RORγt+IL- 22+cells) were visualized with immunofluorescence histology in the paraffin lung tissues sections according to previous published protocols [28,29].
The following antibodies were used: IL- 22 antibody (orb8397, Biorbyt, Cambridge, UK), CD3 antibody (orb11308, Biorbyt, Cambridge, UK), RORγt antibody (PA5 - 23,148, Thermo, MA, USA).
All micrographs were acquired on a microscope (BA210 T, Motic).
After the depletion of Lin+and CRTH2+cells from human blood by using the Human ILC2 isolation kit (No.130–114–825, Miltenyi Biotec, Köln, Germany), ILC3 s were separated from ILC1 s using the anti-human antibodies of CD127 and CD117 through flow cytometry.
The purity of ILC3 s (> 90%) was confirmed by flow cytometry after sorting.
From 100 mL of human blood, approximately 1 × 104cells could be yielded.
Isolated ILC3 s were cultured in 200 μL RPMI 1640 with 2% human serum, isolated from the same human donor, for 1 h, and then stimulated with 40 μM baicalin.
After 8 h, cells were harvested and the supernatants were stored at − 80 °C after centrifugation.
IL- 22 levels in the supernatant of ILC3 s were detected before or after baicalin treatment by using the Human IL- 22 DuoSet ELISA kit (DY782, R&D systems, Emeryville, CA, USA).
All the experiments were repeated thrice and the data presented was collective data of three individual experiments.
Western blotting images provided were representative of three experiments.
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and ANOVA was used for comparison between groups for normal distribution data.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
GraphPad Prism 9.0 statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) was used for data statistical analysis.
Participant characteristics are detailed in the Supplementary tableS1.
Compared to other groups, ECOPD patients complicated with bacterial infections exhibited a reduced number of eosinophils in both blood and sputum (Fig.1a), as well as ILC2 s in peripheral blood (Fig.1b and c).
Meanwhile, their ILC1 s and ILC3 s increased compared to the healthy controls (Fig.1b).
Additionally, there was a loss of GATA3 expression in blood ILC2 s in bacterial infection group (Fig.1c).
Conversely, their expression of RORγt, IL- 17, and IL- 22 in blood ILC3 s were increased (Fig.1c).
Changes in levels of signature cytokines of type 2 and type 3 immunity subgroups in serum aligned with the changes of cell counts, with a significant increasing in blood IL- 22 levels found in the bacteria-infected group (Fig.1d).
Notably, while the expression of IL- 5 in blood ILC2 s was elevated in ECOPD patients compared to healthy controls (Fig.1c), total serum IL- 5 levels remained unchanged across groups (Fig.1d).
Although IL- 6 is not specifically classified as a type 3 cytokine, its role in supporting ILC3 function is particularly notable [30].
Our results showed a significant increase of IL- 6 in bacterial infected ECOPD patients than others (Fig.1d).
Representative flow cytometric plots demonstrating gating strategy for identifying ILC subsets and their signature markers were shown in Supplementary Fig.1.
Compared to the control group, LPS group or CS group, mice in the CS + LPS group showed a decreased body weight, further impaired lung function (Fig.2a), and increased inflammatory lesions in lung tissues (Fig.2b) and total cell infiltrations in BALF (Fig.2c).
The number of eosinophils in BALF were significantly decreased after CS exposure, especially with a combined treatment of LPS, analysed through both cell smear and flow cytometry (Fig.2c and Supplementary Fig.2).
Besides, a reduced percentage of ILC2 s in lung tissue homogenate was observed in CS + LPS group, accompanied by an increase in ILC1 s and ILC3 s (Fig.3a).
IL- 13 and IL- 33 levels in BAL fluid were significantly reduced in the CS + LPS group compared to controls (Fig.3b), however, their expressions in lung tissue homogenate remained unchanged (Fig.3b).
This discrepancy might suggest compartmentalized regulation of these cytokines: IL- 13 and IL- 33 secretion into the airway lumen may be suppressed during exacerbations, while parenchymal their productions persist in lung tissues.
Oppositely, the expression of IL- 22 and Reg3γ in both protein and mRNA levels were increased after CS and LPS administration (Fig.4a-c).
Consistent with the change of ILC2 s, the level of GATA3 expression in lung tissues was decreased (Fig.4b).
Considering the consistent increasing in ILC3 s and IL- 22, we performed immunofluorescence staining to show that a significant rising in the percentage of CD3−IL- 22+RORγt+cells in mice lung tissues in CS + LPS group (Fig.5), indicating an involvement of IL- 22-producing ILC3 s in ECOPD conditions that complicated with bacterial infections.
In order to explore the role of IL- 22 in ECOPD pathological process, we treated ECOPD mice with recombinant IL- 22.
After IL- 22 administration, the number of lung eosinophils and ILC2 s reduced, accompanied by an increase in ILC3 s (Fig.6a).
The expressions of IL- 33 was also inhibited by IL- 22 (Fig.6a).
However, the inflammation score and the GATA3 expression in lung tissues were not significantly influenced by IL- 22 (Fig.6c).
The proteomics analysis showed 527 DEGs between groups, with 143 proteins being up-regulated and 384 proteins being down-regulated (Fig.7a and b).
The enrichment demonstrated a vital biological process of IL- 22 in regulating the immune responses, including the innate immunity (Fig.7c).
The lung transcriptome identified genes involved after IL- 22 treatment.
A total of 3558 DEGs were found between groups, with 1736 genes being up-regulated and 1822 genes down-regulated (Fig.8a, b).
The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses further explained the ability of IL- 22 on regulating multiple cytokines such as IL- 6, IL- 12, IL- 1β, TNF-α, as well as chemokines such as C-X-C motif ligand (Cxcl)2, Cxcl3, C–C Motif ligand (Ccl)3, Ccl4, Cxcl11, Cxcl12, Ccl2, et al. (Fig.8c, d), thus influencing the leukocyte proliferation, migration, and activation (Fig.8e) through multiple inflammatory signaling pathways (Fig.8f).
To discover the effect of baicalin in ECOPD, we treated mice models with different doses of baicalin.
Compared to the CS + LPS group, high dose of baicalin significantly improved the FEV50/FVC (Fig.9a) and alleviated inflammatory damages in lung tissues (Fig.9b).
Besides, baicalin significantly induced the accumulation of eosinophils in BALF (Fig.9b).
The ILC2 s were also increased in lung tissues, accompanied with reduced frequencies of ILC1 s and ILC3 s (Fig.9c).
Moreover, the expression of IL- 5, IL- 13, and IL- 33 in BALF or lung tissues were up-regulated by baicalin (Fig.9d).
Compared to the CS + LPS group, the protein expression of IL- 22and Reg3γ in lung tissues was down-regulated by baicalin (Fig.10a-c).
While the GATA3 protein level was not influenced (Fig.10b).
Besides, the CD3−IL- 22+RORγt+cells in lung tissues were slightly reduced after baicalin treatment (Fig.10d).
In order to confirm the effect of baicalin on ILC3 s, we isolated human ILC3 s from peripheral blood, and treated them with 20 μM baicalin, which showed that baicalin significantly reduced the production of IL- 22 in ILC3 cell supernatant (Fig.10e).
COPD is a multifaceted inflammatory condition characterized by persistent symptoms that are periodically exacerbated by acute flare-ups.
These exacerbations are often intricately associated with immune dysregulation involving ILCs [31].
Among ILC subsets, ILC2 s play a crucial role in mediating eosinophilic and type 2 immune responses in COPD [32].
Activation of ILC2 occurs through epithelial cell-derived cytokines such as IL- 33, IL- 25, and TSLP, leading to the production of Th2 cytokines including IL- 4, IL- 9, IL- 5, and IL- 13, ultimately contributing to eosinophilic inflammation [33].
Our cross-sectional clinical study revealed notable alterations in ILC subsets during COPD exacerbations, marked by eosinopenia, decreased ILC2 populations, and concurrently increased ILC1 s and ILC3 s, particularly in bacterial infection-associated cases.
ILC1 and ILC3 responses are considered crucial in host defense against bacterial pathogens [34], with neutrophilic inflammation characterizing these immune responses.
While ILC2 s are predominantly linked to wound repair, helminth infection, and allergic condition, rather than bacterial infections, often accompanied by eosinophil infiltration in affected parts.
Our findings suggest that bacterial infections in respiratory tract may impair the normal functioning of ILC2 immunity, which might contribute to tissue damage and lung inflammation driven by bacterial pathogens.
Notably, an increased IL- 5 expression in blood ILC2 s was observed in ECOPD patients than healthy control, however, total serum IL- 5 levels remained unchanged between them.
This might suggest that despite enhanced IL- 5 production by ILC2 s during exacerbations, systemic IL- 5 is regulated by compensatory mechanisms, such as increased consumption by eosinophils or degradation in circulation, et al. Alternatively, other IL- 5-producing cells (e.g., Th2 lymphocytes) might exhibit reduced activity, offsetting the contribution of ILC2 s to systemic IL- 5 levels.
Besides, the inconsistency of IL- 13 and IL- 33 changing pattern between BAL fluid and lung tissue homogenate highlights spatial heterogeneity in cytokine dynamics during ECOPD.
These discrepancies highlight the complexity of cytokine regulation and type 2 immune response during ECOPD, and also underscores the need to evaluate cellular, localized, and systemic cytokine dynamics.
Besides, alterations in ILC subsets during exacerbations of COPD correlated with elevated levels of IL- 22, a cytokine recognized for its role in mucosal immunity, tissue repair, and immune regulation in inflammatory lung diseases.
Previous studies have reported increased IL- 22 levels in induced sputum and airway epithelial brushings from COPD patients [35,36], suggesting that IL- 22 may serve as a potential susceptibility factor for COPD exacerbations [22,35].
Our results further underscore the role of IL- 22 in COPD exacerbation, in line with earlier studies that demonstrate IL- 22’s ability to stimulate epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial proteins such as C-type lectins Reg3β and Reg3γ, which exhibit direct antimicrobial activity against certain bacterial pathogens [37,38].
To delve deeper into the involvement of IL- 22 in eosinopenia and ILC2 immune suppression during COPD exacerbations, we employed CS and LPS-induced ECOPD mouse models.
In these models, we confirmed the presence of lung eosinopenia and inhibited ILC2 immune response under ECOPD conditions, alongside increased expression of IL- 22 and its downstream protein Reg3γ.
Moreover, exogenous IL- 22 supplementation suppressed eosinophil and ILC2 aggregation, as well as IL- 33 expression in the lungs of ECOPD mice.
These findings align with previous studies indicating that the IL- 22/Reg3γ signaling pathway suppresses the IL- 33/ILC2 axis in house dust mite-induced asthma models [16,39].
Notably, we observed no inhibition of GATA3 expression following IL- 22 treatment, suggesting that IL- 22’s effects on ILC2 immune dysfunction might primarily stem from its suppression of IL- 33 production.
Additionally, we found that IL- 22 might induce the ILC immune bias by modulating the cytokine and chemokine profiles.
Type 2 immunity is traditionally orchestrated by a set of cytokines primarily produced by ILC2 s and their adaptive counterparts, CD4+Th2 cells, in conjunction with contributions from myeloid cells and antibodies.
In contrast, type 1 and type 3 cytokines influence the normal function and maintenance of type 2 immunity [3].
Our multi-omics analysis revealed that IL- 22 enhanced the expression of multiple cytokines (such as IL- 12, IL- 1β, IL- 6, et al.)
and chemokines (such as CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL2, et al.
), fostering an environment favorable to type 1 and type 3 immune responses, while simultaneously inhibiting type 2 immunity [3,30,40–49].
Baicalin, a major extract derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal herbScutellaria radix, has been linked to protective roles in ILC2-mediated type 2 immune responses, which can help mitigate lung inflammation induced by CS, bacteria (including LPS), and viruses [50–52].
Our study observed that baicalin treatment led to increase ILC2 accumulation and activity, correlating with reduced lung inflammation.
This aligns with the established protective roles of type 2 immunity in conditions related to cigarette smoking [53].
However, contrasting findings from asthma models have highlighted baicalin’s ability to suppress eosinophilic inflammation [54,55], suggesting that baicalin may bidirectionally modulate type 2 immune responses depending on the specific context, a notion supported by extensive clinical observations [56].
Notably, systemic imbalances in T lymphocyte populations contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of COPD [57,58].
Studies have demonstrated that baicalin can alleviate intestinal inflammation in young mice exposed to lincomycin by upregulating IL- 21R expression, thus promotes a shift from Th1/Th2 immune balance towards Th2 polarization [59].
Moreover, network pharmacology analysis indicates that baicalin may regulate the Th17/Treg axis through specific target proteins [60].
Our results expand the knowledge that baicalin may alleviate lung inflammation by restoring innate immune balance, particularly through the enhancement of ILC2 immunity.
Additionally, baicalin appears to attenuate the IL- 22 production, at least partially by inhibiting the activation and aggregation of ILC3 s. This indicates that baicalin may play a role in mitigating IL- 22-mediated immune dysregulation and associated inflammatory conditions.
Given IL- 22’s dual role in lung inflammation and pathogen defense [61], its modulation by baicalin could offer therapeutic benefits by balancing the protective effects while dampening its detrimental impact on lung inflammation and immune regulation.
This study does have limitations that warrant to be addressed in further investigation.
First, the cross-sectional design of the clinical study limits our ability to draw causal conclusions about the dynamic changes in ILC populations and cytokine profiles during COPD exacerbations.
Longitudinal studies would be beneficial to track these changes over time and further elucidate the cause-and-effect relationship between immune dysregulation and disease progression.
Second, our study did not quantify ILC2 numbers or the concentrations of IL- 22 and IL- 33 in induced sputum samples due to undetectable levels of these markers.
Although animal models provided consistent data with human findings, the variability in biomarker levels across individuals and sample types in humans suggests that larger cohort studies may be needed to validate the findings.
Additionally, while the exogenous supplementation of IL- 22 in animal models provided insights into the IL- 22/Reg3γ signaling pathway and its role in immune suppression, the effects of IL- 22 antagonism or genetic knockout of IL- 22 in this context were not examined.
Using IL- 22 antagonists or knockout models would provide a more direct assessment of IL- 22's specific contributions to immune dysfunction during COPD exacerbations.
This would also help to strengthen the reliability and mechanistic understanding of the observed immune responses.
Furthermore, our study primarily focused on the role of ILC2 s and IL- 22 in bacterial infection-related COPD exacerbations, but other potential contributors such as viral infections, pollutants, and environmental factors may also influence immune dysregulation.
Future research should consider the multifactorial nature of COPD exacerbations and explore the interactions between different environmental and infectious triggers in the modulation of immune responses.
Finally, while we have explored the impact of baicalin on ILC2 s and IL- 22 modulation, further studies are needed to better understand the dose-dependent effects and long-term therapeutic potential of baicalin in COPD management.
The clinical applicability of baicalin requires comprehensive investigations on its pharmacokinetics, optimal dosage, and potential side effects in COPD patients.
It should be noted that while baicalin demonstrates broad therapeutic potential in preclinical models, its translation to human applications faces significant hurdles.
Poor oral bioavailability (~ 2%) necessitates advanced formulations (e.g., nanoparticles) to achieve therapeutic plasma levels [62,63], which remain under clinical investigation.
Dose translation from mice to humans, while feasible via body surface area scaling (~ 1 g/day for a 60 kg adult), requires validation in large-scale trials to balance efficacy and safety.
Mechanistically, baicalin’s pleiotropic effects risk off-target interactions, underscoring the need for disease-specific studies.
Furthermore, variability in herbal sourcing and lack of regulatory standardization challenge reproducibility.
Although early-phase trial in coronary artery disease and rheumatoid arthritis is promising [64], and it has been studied in non-small cell lung cancer and diabetes (https://www.chictr.org.cn/, ChiCTR2100051276, ChiCTR2100051281, and ChiCTR2300074978), baicalin is not a panacea; its application must be context-specific, guided by robust clinical evidence.
Baicalin may hold potential as a therapeutic agent in alleviating lung inflammation during COPD exacerbations, possibly by restoring immune balance through modulation of ILCs, particularly by enhancing ILC2 immune responses.
This effect appears to be partially mediated by the inhibition of IL- 22 production.
While the findings suggest promising therapeutic implications, further studies are needed to confirm the precise mechanisms and assess the long-term efficacy of baicalin in COPD management..
