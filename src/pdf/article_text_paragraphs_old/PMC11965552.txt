Developing rice (Oryza sativaL.) cultivars with resistance to bacterial leaf blight (BLB) and blast is crucial for ensuring food security, as these diseases can cause significant yield losses. Additionally, enhancing yield potential in these resistant cultivars can maximize productivity and meet the growing demand for rice; therefore, introgression of bacterial leaf blight and blast resistance genes along with yield improvement genes is the most felicitous strategy for a panoramic genetic enhancement. Jaya is a most popular, stable mega rice variety, notified and cultivated in 19 states across India, and is susceptible to bacterial leaf blight and blast diseases and has an average yielding ability (4.5 t/ha). In the current investigation, efforts have been made to transferXa21for BLB resistance,Pi54for blast resistance, andGn1afor yield improvement. A total of 20 BC2F2introgression lines with targeted BLB, blast, and yield genes were identified. Based on preliminary yield trials in BC2F3generation, two best lines (BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4) and which showed higher phenotypic disease resistance along with superior yield performance were selected for multi‐location testing along with recurrent parent. Both the lines performed superior with respect to disease resistance and grain yield, along with acceptable grain quality which can be comparable to the recurrent parent Jaya.

TheGn1aQTL, known for increasing grain number, contributed to higher yields in the improved lines of Jaya rice variety.

Xa21gene introgression led to resistance againstXooisolate among the improved lines of Jaya.

The improved lines demonstrated good grain quality and increased yield when tested across multiple locations.

Rice (Oryza sativaL.) is one of the most significant staple crops in the world and provides sustenance to billions of people and is essential for ensuring food security. In 2023–2024, the world rice production was 522 million tons. India has a production of 135.76 million tons from an area of 46.3 million hectares with an average yield of 2.93 t/ha, feeding the mouths of more than 75% of the population (https://www.indiastat.com, 2023–2024). To meet the food security of the growing population, the exigency for rice is anticipated to increase by 40% by 2030 (Khush,2005). This demand can be met only if there is an increase in rice production and productivity through the development of biotic and abiotic stress‐resistant varieties. Among biotic factors, blast and bacterial leaf blight (BLB) are highly devastating diseases of rice, together affecting grain production by 20–50%. Breeding for targeted disease resistance among the popular varieties remains the most economical and effective way in controlling the BLB and blast of rice (Fiyaz et al.,2022).

BLB caused byXanthomonas oryzaepv.oryzaeis one of the oldest known vascular disease‐causing yield losses by 6%–60% by creating a significant threat to rice cultivation (Srinivasan et al.,1959). To date, 48 BLB genes have been identified, and the most recent one has been fine mapped and reported by Sinha et al. (2023). Among these, 11 genes have been cloned and characterized.Xa21is the most significant and broad spectrum‐resistant gene; hence, it is more utilized under resistance breeding programs (Fiyaz et al.,2022). Rice blast, caused by the fungusMagnaporthe grisea, is found to be the most devastating rice disease and often results in yield losses up to 70%–80% during an epidemic (Ou,1985). To date, 109 significant genes for leaf blast resistance have been discovered, of which 25 genes have been molecularly characterized with “Pib” being the first cloned R gene (G.‐L. Wang et al.,1999). The “Pi54” locus which confers broad‐spectrum resistance against variousM. oryzaeisolates was found to be the ideal choice to introgress into popular rice varieties. Rice grain production is a multifaceted attribute, and numerous additional characteristics, including plant architecture, heading date, and the level of biotic/abiotic stress resistance, have a direct or indirect impact on it. In rice, about 20 major effect genes were found to affect yield significantly.Gn1a(OsCKX2) is the first gene to be isolated that controls the rice grain yield by regulating cytokinin and the number of spikelets. Reduced expression ofGn1acauses cytokinin accumulation in the inflorescence meristems and, consequently, increases the number of spikelets (Ashikari et al.,2005; Yeh et al.,2015). Marker‐assisted backcross breeding (MABB) is mainly used to transfer favorable traits from a donor parent into popular recurrent for which recurrent parent is lacking.

As a result, the research intended to introduce the genes that are related to yield enhancement into an elite rice variety known as “Jaya.” This would be accomplished by increasing the grain number per panicle (Gn1a), having resistance to bacterial leaf blight (Xa21) and blast (Pi54) resistance.

The experimental material consisted of two indica rice varieties, “Jaya” as the recurrent parent and “isogenic line of MTU 1010” as a donor parent. Jaya was the first variety developed after the initiation of the All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Programme (AICRIP) through systematic breeding efforts by the renowned rice breeder Dr. S.V.S. Shastry and his team using TN1/T141 as parents, at Indian Council of Agricultural Research‐Indian Institute of Rice Research (ICAR‐IIRR), Hyderabad, India. The variety Jaya was released in 1968 and is well suited to high altitudes as well as wet and upland cultivation and has been notified and released for cultivation in 19 states across India. It is medium duration, semi‐dwarf rice, and produces long bold grains. The donor parent is an isogenic line (IL) of a popular variety MTU 1010, a high‐yielding, BLB‐ and blast‐resistant line, developed through MABB at ICAR‐IIRR, Hyderabad.

A crossing program was carried out to introgress the BLB (Xa21), blast (Pi54) genes, and yield‐enhancing (Gn1a) quantitative trait loci (QTL) into the recurrent parent through the MABB strategy. During the crossing program, Jaya was used as female and IL of MTU 1010 (withXa21+Pi54+Gn1a) as male. A total of two backcrosses were made involving foreground and background selection each time. Selected backcross lines were maintained through selfing (Figure1).

A mini preparation procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the freshly collected leaf samples using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method (Doyle & Doyle,1990). DNA quality and quantity were assessed by using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND‐1000. The quantity of DNA in different samples varied from 50 to 1200 ng/µL. After quantification, all the samples were diluted to 50 ng/µL and were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. Standard annealing temperature specific to each marker was used for the PCR amplification. PCR products were resolved on 3% agarose gels stained with EtBr, and the gel images were captured using Gel documentation unit.

Validation of molecular markers with trait phenotype was carried out among the donor (MTU 1010 withXa21+Pi54+Gn1a) and recurrent parent (Jaya) plant population grown in field during 2020‐wet season (June–October). Functional markers specific to these traits (TableS1) were utilized in validating parental lines. Foreground and background selection was carried out during BC1F1, BC2F1, and BC2F2generation. Until BC2F1generation, background genome recovery was estimated using a set of 118 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers out of total 862 SSR markers used in the study (TableS2). Among BC2F2selected plants, background recovery was estimated using polymorphic markers identified through 1K‐RiCA (rice custom amplicon) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chips (TableS3). Background genome recovery was estimated as explained by Sundaram et al. (2008).

Phenotypic screening was carried out among the BC2F2population to reduce the population size for genotyping. Keeping BLB resistance and recurrent parent similarity as a selection criteria, only 150 plants were selected for foreground selection. Station trials were conducted for BLB and blast disease screening at ICAR‐IIRR research field and uniform blast nursery (UBN), respectively, for two consecutive seasons. BLB screening was conducted in BC2F2and BC2F3, whereas blast screening was conducted in BC2F3and BC2F4generations.

BLB isolate IX‐020 (Xanthomonas oryzaepv.oryzae[Xoo]) is one of the highly virulent isolates collected from the ICAR‐IIRR, Hyderabad, Telangana state, and was used to screen all the backcross‐derived lines in BC2F2and BC2F3generations possessing the gene combinationsXa21+Pi54+Gn1aalong with the donor and recurrent parents. The bacterial culture of the pathogen was maintained, harvested, and diluted as described by Preece et al. (1982). Inoculation was done during the early hours of the day when the crop was at the maximum tillering stage following the leaf clip method of Kauffman et al. (1973). Symptoms were measured 15 days after inoculation as per the screening protocols given by Chen et al. (2000). The mean lesion length on three inoculated leaves per plant was considered for assigning the disease score.

In station trials, blast screening was carried out at UBN available at the division of plant pathology of ICAR‐IIRR, Hyderabad, India. The bed size of 10 × 1 m2was prepared for sowing. The border row was prepared to sow highly susceptible check Himmatsagar rice‐12, and the middle rows were prepared perpendicular to the border rows for test material. Test entries were sown along with recurrent parent Jaya by repeating resistant control Tetep after every five test entries. Spore suspension (IIRR local isolate SPI‐40) of the blast pathogenMagnaporthe oryzaewas prepared from 10‐day‐old slants of mycelia, and spore concentration was adjusted to ∼105spores/mL. Fifteen‐day‐old seedlings were then inoculated by spraying spore suspension. Controlled conditions were maintained to ensure disease progression as mentioned in IRRI standard evaluation system (2013) protocol. After 15 days of inoculation, test entries were scored comparatively to susceptible and resistant checks as per the 0–9 scale of IRRI, 2013.

Station trials were conducted at the research farm of ICAR‐IIRR, Hyderabad, using randomized complete block design (RCBD) design with three replications (based on station trials data, lines that were found to be highly superior to recurrent parent in terms of yield and disease resistance, were tested in multi‐location yield trials for one season [wet season 2023]). Grain quality estimations were carried out for all the BC2F3lines along with the recurrent parent for the following characters viz., hulling, milling, head rice recovery, grain chalkiness, alkali spreading value, amylose content, gel consistency, and L/B ratio were also recorded as explained in Sundaram et al. (2008).

Analysis of variance of the replicated agronomic data was performed using the SAS version 9.3 software, and background genome recovery estimation was carried out using the Phenogram software as described by Arbelaez et al. (2019). Parental polymorphism was represented using the Map maker 4.0 software.

Two best performing high‐yielding backcross‐derived entries along with recurrent parent were tested across different location (20 different location across nine states and one union territory) in India for yield evaluation. These entries along with recurrent parent were subjected for BLB (12 hotspots) and blast (12 hotspots) multi‐location disease screening along with specific resistant check, and disease score was recorded. The average disease score was calculated to predict the resistance levels of test entries over recurrent parent.

Validation experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of a marker in determining phenotypes among the parental lines by keeping positive and negative controls for each trait. Details of the specific functional markers used in foreground selection are mentioned in TableS1. Results confirmed the presence of positive alleles for all the three genes/QTL(Xa21,Pi54, andGn1a) in the donor parent, and the same was proven to be negative in the recurrent parent (Figure2). The donor parent showed a highly resistance score of 1 for both BLB and blast upon phenotypic screening, and the recurrent parent was found to be susceptible to both the diseases.

From the cross between Jaya and MTU 1010 IL, 21 true F1plants were identified through foreground marker (FigureS1), and subsequent backcrossing to Jaya produced 116 BC1F1plants. Foreground selection identified a total of five plants that were heterozygous for all the three targeted loci. These five plants were screened with 118 polymorphic SSR markers covering all the 12 chromosomes (Figure3) (TableS2). The plant number BC1F1‐2 with the highest recurrent parent genome recovery of 79.66% was used in the second backcrossing to generate 192 BC2F1plants. Foreground selection revealed 30 plants with all the three targeted loci, and background selection was carried among them. It was found that the plant number BC2F1‐2‐27 had the highest recurrent parent genome recovery of 91.52% (Table1). The identified plant was then selfed to produce 1000 BC2F2progeny. Because of large population, initial selection was carried out based on artificial BLB screening in field during tillering stage. Of 1000 plants, 648 BLB‐resistant plants were identified. Again by considering plants phenotypic similarity with recurrent parent of 648 plants, 150 best lines were selected for genotyping. This strategy of combining phenotyping with genotyping for BLB resistance has been previously described by Hari et al. (2013), wherein stringent phenotypic screening initially followed by selective genotyping of resistant plants has been reported to save time and resources.

Out of 150 BC2F2plants, 20 triple gene positive homozygous plants (Xa21,Pi54, andGn1a) were obtained (Figure4) through foreground selection and were designated as follows: BC2F2‐2‐27‐1, BC2F2‐2‐27‐2, BC2F2‐2‐27‐4, BC2F2‐2‐27‐9, BC2F2‐2‐27‐21, BC2F2‐2‐27‐29, BC2F2‐2‐27‐41, BC2F2‐2‐27‐52, BC2F2‐2‐27‐60, BC2F2‐2‐27‐62, BC2F2‐2‐27‐64, BC2F2‐2‐27‐66, BC2F2‐2‐27‐74, BC2F2‐2‐27‐75, BC2F2‐2‐27‐83, BC2F2‐2‐27‐97, BC2F2‐2‐27‐103, BC2F2‐2‐27‐105, BC2F2‐2‐27‐106, and BC2F2‐2‐27‐107.

These plants were further subjected to background genome recovery estimation using 1k‐RiCA SNP chip having 1094 SNPs with the average distance of ∼1.524 cM between two adjacent SNPs to select the best plant(s) with higher recurrent parent genome recovery. A total of 377 polymorphic SNPs were identified between the donor and recurrent parent (TableS3). Results indicated that recurrent parent genome recovery ranged from 85.41% (BC2F2‐2‐27‐105) to 96.28% (BC2F2‐2‐27‐4). Phenogram representing recurrent parent genome recovery of BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 (93.89%) and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4 (96.28%) is indicated in Figure5a,b.

The three BC2F2and BC2F3gene positive lines were evaluated under field conditions for their resistance against bacterial leaf blight for two consecutive seasons (wet and dry season) along with the donor and recurrent parents at research fields available at ICAR‐IIRR (Table2). All the backcross‐derived lines possessingXa21exhibited highly resistant disease reaction with lesion length of <2 cm, while the recurrent parent was found to be highly susceptible to lesion length surpassing >9 cm (Figure6).

BLB screening was conducted at multiple locations across India (FigureS2) for two selected entries alongside the recurrent parent. The average disease score was calculated for the improved lines, the recurrent parent, and a resistant check (Table3). The selected lines, BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4, exhibited lower average disease scores of 3.5 and 3.08, respectively, compared to the recurrent parent, which had an average score of 6.16. In contrast, the resistant check improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) recorded an average disease score of 1.5.

The BC2F3and BC2F4improved lines of Jaya were evaluated along with the recurrent parent at a uniform blast nursery facility available at the ICAR‐IIRR (Table2). All the backcross‐derived lines possessingPi54showed resistant to blast with score ranging from 1 to 2. Among these, lines with the resistance score of 1 did not show any observable lesions on the leaves, and lines with the resistance score of 2 showed tiny roundish to slightly extended necrotic grey spots of about 1–2 mm in diameter (Figure7), while the recurrent parent was found to be susceptible to the disease score of 7.

Multi‐location testing of two nominated entries was subjected to blast resistance screening along with the recurrent parent at different blast hotspots (FigureS2). Both the improved lines, BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4, were found to have a lower disease severity index (DSI) of 3.66 and 3.16, respectively, compared to recurrent parent which has recorded a DSI of 5.66, whereas resistant check Tetep recorded a DSI of 2.50 (Table4).

All the backcross introgression BC2F3lines were subjected to preliminary yield trials along with Jaya (Table5). The improved lines at BC2F3generation possessingXa21,Pi54, andGn1ashowed non‐significance for days to 50% flowering (112–113 days) with Jaya (112 days), plant height was comparable (104.7–107.9 cm) without any significant difference in comparison to Jaya (104.9 cm), number of tillers and productive tillers were non‐significant (11–12 no.) and (10–11 no.) in comparison to Jaya (11 no.) and (10 no.), respectively. Significant higher panicle length (26.5–29.7 cm) was observed compared to Jaya (23.4 cm) (FigureS3); similarly, panicle weight was significantly higher (3.92–8.73 g) than Jaya (3.55 g). The improved lines also exhibited significantly more filled grains per panicle (185–300 no.) compared to Jaya (141 no.). However, number of unfilled grains per panicle showed non‐significant difference (13–19 no.) compared to Jaya (18 no.). Thousand grain weight (21.8–22.4 g) was comparable to Jaya (22.4 g) without any significant differences, L/B ratio was non‐significant (2.67–2.82) with Jaya (2.7) indicating that improved lines have similar long bold grain type as of recurrent parent Jaya (FigureS4) and higher grain yield per plant (38.9–49 g) as compared to Jaya (33.5 g) with significant difference except for BC2F2‐2‐27‐103, BC2F2‐2‐27‐106 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐97. All the improved lines had fully strong and thick culms in comparison to recurrent parent. Based on these preliminary yield trials, disease screening, and recurrent parent genome recovery, two best entries viz., BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4, were subjected to multi‐location testing in BC2F4generation.

Two introgression lines (BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4) were sent for 20 different locations, which include nine states and one union territory (Puducherry) (FigureS5) along with recurrent parent Jaya for yield trials. The average performance of BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4 across these locations indicated yield improvement by 4.7% (5338.6 kg/ha) and 7.66% (5510 kg/ha), respectively, in comparison to recurrent parent (5072.9 kg/ha) (Table6).

All the near isogenic lines (NILs) showed acceptable hulling, milling, and head rice recovery percentages. BC2F2‐2‐27‐4 (58.4%) had superior head rice recovery over Jaya (56.3%). Chalkiness was completely absent in BC2F2‐2‐27‐21 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐60 (Table7). All entries retained the grain type appearance (long bold) of the recurrent parent Jaya.

The Jaya variety of long bold rice is a mid‐early, high‐yielding variety that was released in 1968. It was embraced by the majority of the states in India because it is well adapted to cultivation at high altitudes, in wet and upland environments. Owing to its wide adaptability and desirable agronomic traits, Jaya has been extensively used in the pedigree of many high‐yielding cultivars released in the country. Despite its desirable agronomic traits, it is susceptible to BLB and blast disease and has an average yielding ability. Hence, the present study deals with the validation followed by introgression of favorable alleles pertaining toXa21andPi54genes andGn1aQTL in the genetic background of the variety Jaya through station and multi‐location trials.

Foreground selection was carried out using gene‐specific markers for the targeted traits similar to the reports of Jamaloddin et al. (2020), Biswas et al. (2021), Sowmiya et al. (2024), and Subburaj et al. (2024) forXa21andPi54, and Reyes et al. (2021) and Kikuta et al. (2023) forGn1a. Each backcross generation was perfectly genotyped to identify stable expression of the targeted traits. Stringent background selection was employed with SSR and SNP markers across the genome and backcross‐derived line, and the maximum recurrent parent genome of ∼96.28 was recovered at BC2F2generation. Our results are in agreement with Basavaraj et al. (2010), S. K. Singh et al. (2022), Sundaram et al. (2008), and Rekha et al. (2022) who reported more than 94% recurrent parent genome recovery with two backcrosses and selfing. Two backcrosses and stepwise background recovery along with phenotypic selection helped to recover desirable attributes of the Jaya viz., grain type, plant height, and number of productive tillers along with standard grain quality traits similar to Jaya.

The backcross‐derived lines of Jaya possessing resistant allele ofXa21showed highly resistant disease reaction in station trials with lesion length of below 2 cm in both wet and dry seasons. The recurrent parent Jaya was scored as susceptible to a lesion length of more than 9 cm in both wet and dry seasons. Multi‐location trials of selected lines along with recurrent parent and resistant check ISM (with three genes viz.,Xa21,xa5, andxa13) indicate promising resistance effect ofXa21locus alone with a lower average disease score compared to recurrent parent Jaya across many rice‐cultivating environments. Similar reports were observed where,Xa21known to give incompatible reaction to most of the isolates tested against it across India. Studies by Z. X. Wang et al. (1996) and Mishra et al. (2013) reported the incompatible reaction of 90.62%, 93%, and 88% of total collected isolates, respectively, and these studies concluded by statingXa21is effective to confer broad spectrum resistance for the majority of the isolates available in India. There are many recent reports available on successful introgressionXa21into elite rice varieties which imparted promising resistance among the introgression lines against major BLB isolates across India (Hari et al.,2013; Janaki Ramayya et al.,2021; Sundaram et al.,2008). However, considering the performance of the introgression lines at individual screening locations at Ludhiana (Punjab) and Maruteru (Andra Pradesh),Xa21made least impact in expressing resistance unlike in other screening locations. Surprisingly, resistant check ISM also showed higher lesion length in comparison to other screening locations. Nelson et al. (2018) explained the cause of susceptible disease reaction of genotypes carrying the same resistant gene at different locations by confirming the genesis of virulent version of the existing local isolate through mutations led by climate changes. This condition has been earlier explained by Yugander et al. (2017) and Du et al. (2022) in which congenial disease environment helps pathogen to evolve into highly virulent isolates which led to the breakdown of existing resistant gene(s). Hence, we can conclude that Ludhiana and Maruteru are among the potential BLB hotspots that need genotypes with a new combination of resistance genes or completely new super resistant gene(s) to tackle disease severity such as incorporating the recessive genesxa13and orxa5in addition toXa21in introgressed lines. In contrast, another disease screening location, that is, Moncompu (Kerala) where both introgression lines carryingXa21and resistant check ISM, showed immune reaction and the recurrent parent Jaya which showed a resistance score of 3. This explains that the occurrence of disease severity majorly depends on the virulence of pathogen and existing environmental conditions.

All the 20 introgression lines screened against the local blast isolate (SPI‐40) at the ICAR‐IIRR station trials demonstrated resistance in both wet and dry seasons. During multi‐location testing, introgression lines recorded varied response for the pathogenM. Oryzae. This phenomenon was explained Yadav et al. (2019) quoting the epistatic gene interaction and virulence of the isolate located in different hotspots led to differential resistant reaction among the derived lines. Similarly, Devi et al. (2015) highlighted that disease hotspots harbor diverse pathogen populations, there by genotype with single resistant gene known to show differential disease reaction and also they mentioned testing genotypes in multiple disease hotspots is much better than testing with the single isolates of the pathogen there by, breeder can get the resistant pattern offered by the gene in across different locations, which in turn helps in developing location specific resistant varieties. Many earlier studies reported thatPi54is the best choice for developing blast‐resistant varieties through introgression (Kiran et al.,2020; Rai et al.,2011; Sharma et al.,2002; Thulasinathan et al.,2023; Zhang et al.,2018), and as evidence, our results indicate that the Jaya introgression lines showed lower average disease score compared to recurrent parent Jaya. Hence,Pi54could be an important target as a single gene or in combination with other blast resistant genes for introgression into blast susceptible elite rice cultivars.

All the 20 introgression lines were evaluated for their agro morphological and yield contributing traits in RCBD at station trials. Best selected entries were sent for multi‐location yield trials, along with the recurrent parent. The performance of the selected lines was superior in multi‐location testing, which is an indication of the effectiveness ofGn1aintrogression into the recurrent parent Jaya.Gn1aencodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase2 enzyme (OsCKX2), which transforms the biologically active cytokinin to its inert form. The favorable allele ofGn1ais associated with the reduced cytokinin dehydrogenase activity, and this leads to cytokinin accumulation in the inflorescence meristem, which in turn increases both grain number and branches, thereby enhancing grain yield (Feng et al.,2017; Yeh et al.,2015).

In our study, upon introgression ofGn1a, there was a significant improvement in single plant yield which is indirectly impacted by a significant increase in the number of grains per panicle, panicle length, and panicle weight. Agata et al. (2023) reported the effect ofGn1aon the increased number of spikelets, and primary branching resulted in increased panicle weight and overall yield among the NILs carryingGn1aQTL. This study also reported thatGn1ain combination with other beneficial QTLs contributed to increased panicle length. There are several reports that highlighted the significantly increased number of spikelets per panicle through introgression ofGn1aQTL using MABC technique in many different mega rice varieties (Ashikari et al.,2005; Ohsumi et al.,2011; Reyes et al.,2021).

Introgression ofXa21,Pi54, andGn1ahad no negative effect on yield and yield‐related traits, grain quality, and other agronomic performance in the genetic background of the recurrent parent Jaya. This is because of stringent background and phenotypic selection made during BC2F2generation. Compared to the earlier successful reports (Basavaraj et al.,2010; S. K. Singh et al.,2022; Sruthi et al.,2016), we have screened higher number of parental polymorphic markers (i.e., 862 SSR markers) and obtained great number of polymorphic markers (i.e., 118) across the chromosomes with a better coverage per chromosome (∼9.8 polymorphic markers per chromosome) for background genetic selection in BC1F1and BC2F1generations. In addition to SSR, 377 polymorphic SNPs were identified between the donor and recurrent parent using 1K‐RiCA SNP chips (1094 SNPs) and are utilized in background genome recovery estimation in BC2F2generation. Using a combination of SSR and SNP markers, the highest recurrent parent genome recovery (i.e., 96.28%) was achieved in BC2F2lines. Backcross‐derived improved lines were observed to be superior with respect to bacterial leaf blight, blast resistance, and in terms of yield. The introgression lines BC2F2‐2‐27‐4 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 were considered outstanding versions of existing mega rice variety Jaya with all the desirable combinations of characters from both the donor and recurrent parent.

Jaya, the iconic semi‐dwarf rice variety developed in 1968, has completed over 56 years of cultivation, remaining popular among farmers even today. Known as a “miracle variety,” Jaya broke the yield barrier of its time, transforming India into a self‐sufficient nation in rice production during the late 1960s and early 1970s. At the time of its release, Jaya demonstrated a baseline yield potential of 4.5 t/ha. Over the past 56 years, Indian breeding programs have achieved steady annual yield improvements, with this study contributing a remarkable breakthrough. The introgression of yield‐enhancing genes has led to a 4.7% and 7.6% yield increase in the improved lines BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐4, respectively, compared to the original Jaya. These advancements underscore the effectiveness of targeted gene introgression in overcoming yield plateaus and accelerating genetic progress in rice breeding.

Comparative multi‐locational data for the nominated entries, BC2F2‐2‐27‐4 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐2 and the recurrent parent Jaya collected from hotspot locations across India revealed that these two lines had lower average disease score along with yield superiority of 7.66% (BC2F2‐2‐27‐4) and 4.7% (BC2F2‐2‐27‐2) over recurrent parent along with on‐par grain quality traits. Hence, these two lines are considered a promising replacement for existing mega rice variety Jaya.

The current study proposes to enhance Jaya by developing improved variants that exhibit increased yield (Gn1a) along with resistance to bacterial leaf blight (Xa21) and blast disease (Pi54). The strategy of concurrent foreground, background, and phenotypic selection has proven to be an effective method for discovering optimal backcross introgressed lines that surpass the recurrent parent in desired qualities while preserving the genetic background of the elite recurrent parent. Two lines from the 20 lines, exhibiting greater similarities to the recurrent parents (BC2F2‐2‐27‐4 and BC2F2‐2‐27‐2), were evaluated for their superiority over the recurrent parent in multi‐location trials. All backcross‐derived lines can serve as innovative donor sources in crossing initiatives. The enhanced backcross‐derived lines of Jaya may significantly benefit farmers by providing resistance to bacterial blight and blast diseases, thereby lowering disease management expenses.
