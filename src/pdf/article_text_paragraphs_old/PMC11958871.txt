High‐throughput digital phenotyping (DP) has been widely explored in plant breeding to assess large numbers of genotypes with minimal manual labor and reduced cost and time. DP platforms using high‐resolution images captured by drones and tractor‐based platforms have recently allowed the University of Florida strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) breeding program to assess vegetative biomass at scale. Biomass has not previously been explored in a strawberry breeding context due to the labor required and the need to destroy the plant. This study aims to understand the genetic basis of predicted vegetative biomass and biomass‐related traits and to chart a path for the combined use of DP and genomics in strawberry breeding. Aboveground dry vegetative biomass was estimated by adapting a previously published model using ground‐truth data on a subset of breeding germplasm. High‐resolution images were collected on clonally replicated trials at different time points during the fruiting season. There was moderate to high heritability (h2= 0.26–0.56) for predicted vegetative biomass, and genetic correlations between vegetative biomass and marketable yield were mostly positive (rG= −0.13–0.47). Fruit yield traits scaled on a vegetative biomass basis also had moderate to high heritability (h2= 0.25–0.64). This suggests that vegetative biomass can be decreased or increased through selection, and that marketable fruit yield can be improved without simultaneously increasing plant size. No consistent marker‐trait associations were discovered via genome‐wide association studies. On the other hand, predictive abilities from genomic selection ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 across traits and years, suggesting that genomic prediction will be an effective breeding tool for vegetative biomass in strawberry.

These measurements allowed us to examine the inheritance of biomass and balance selection for yield and plant size.

Predictive abilities from genomic selection were moderate and will allow effective predictive breeding for biomass.

Improvement of DP methods for biomass estimation could also improve selection accuracy for biomass in the future.

Cultivated strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa) is the most widely consumed fruit crop in the world with an annual production of 9.5 million metric ton in 2022 (FAO‐UN,2022). Although the production of strawberries increased by 1168% from 1961 to 2022 due to an increase in acreage, only a 200% increase in yield was observed (FAO‐UN,2022). To meet the growing global demands for strawberries, it is vital for strawberry breeding programs to develop high‐yielding cultivars while also improving ease of harvest, fruit quality, and disease resistance.

In the United States, most strawberries are produced in California and Florida. As of 2022, California produced 89.1% of strawberries in the United States, while Florida, known for its peak strawberry production during winter, produced 10.9% (USDA‐NASS,2023). The University of Florida (UF) breeding program develops cultivars that are adapted for fruit production during the winter season in west‐central Florida. Currently, strawberry fruit production in west‐central Florida begins in late November and peaks during February and March as the weather warms and the plants continue to accumulate crowns and leaves (Whitaker & Fan,2020; Wu et al.,2015). Development of early yielding strawberries is an important breeding objective at UF to help Florida farmers take advantage of high prices from late November until the end of January.

Harvest efficiency is also an important breeding objective since harvesting is a labor‐intensive and costly activity that represents about 57% of the total cost of strawberry production (Guan et al.,2018). Selecting for a moderate plant size helps increase efficiency of manual harvesting and allows strawberry plants to fit within desired in‐row spacings. On the other hand, per plant yield tends to be positively correlated to leaf area and plant size (Agehara,2021). Plant biomass is the total mass of a plant, including aboveground plant parts such as stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits, as well as the root system (Poorter & Nagel,2000). Plant vegetative biomass, which is our focus here, refers to only leaves and stems. High vegetative biomass is associated with the potential for higher yields across plant species (Poorter et al.,2009). With an increase in leaf biomass, higher photosynthesis is expected, which in turn increases biomass accumulation that can lead to greater yield (Burgess et al.,2023; Poorter et al.,2009; Zhu et al.,2010). However, direct measurement of vegetative biomass is labor‐intensive, time consuming, and requires the destruction of the plant. Implementation of high‐throughput phenotyping approaches, including digital phenotyping (DP), can help address these limitations.

Recent advances in DP technologies have enabled rapid and detailed extraction of plant traits on a large scale. Image‐based DP using ground‐based and aerial systems are the two most common approaches (Guan et al.,2020; Krause et al.,2020; Pérez‐Ruiz et al.,2020; H. Zheng et al.,2019). In strawberry, Guan et al. (2020) used high‐resolution imagery obtained from a ground‐based imaging system mounted on a tractor to develop a model predicting vegetative biomass with an accuracy (R2) of 0.79. This previous work has provided an opportunity to estimate vegetative biomass at scale in strawberry and thus to study the genetics of this trait.

Because the ability to measure vegetative biomass at scale is a new development in strawberry, the genetics of this trait have not yet been explored. Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) represent an effective method to discover genetic variants associated with traits, potentially leading to the development of tools for marker‐assisted selection (Ibrahim et al.,2020). However, this approach is most beneficial when the trait is controlled by one or few large‐effect loci. For complex traits, a genomic selection (GS) strategy has been effective for increasing genetic gains in plants (Crossa et al.,2010; de Bem Oliveira et al.,2019; Gezan et al.,2017; Merrick & Carter,2021; Pincot et al.,2020; Tessema et al.,2020). GS uses genome‐wide marker data to predict the performance of untested individuals (Meuwissen et al.,2001), a successful approach in various breeding programs, including in strawberry (Crain et al.,2018; O'Connor et al.,2021; Osorio et al.,2021; Peixoto et al.,2024).

To date, vegetative biomass has not been measured or studied at scale in any strawberry breeding program due to the lack of a high‐throughput and nondestructive method. Now that we have a DP method to estimate vegetative biomass, we are able to explore the genetic basis of this trait in relation to important fruit yield and quality traits. Here, we have combined predicted vegetative biomass data with genomic information from the UF strawberry breeding program to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations for vegetative biomass and yield‐related traits. We also performed GWAS to examine the genetic architecture of vegetative biomass. Lastly, we evaluated the potential of GS, demonstrating the combined use of DP and genomics in strawberry breeding.

The genotypes used in this study represent the elite strawberry germplasm of the Strawberry Breeding and Genetics Program of the UF including released cultivars and advanced selections. These were planted in replicated yield trials during the 2017–2018, 2018–2019, 2020–2021, and 2021–2022 seasons on October 9, October 10, October 7, and October 6, respectively, at the UF/IFAS Gulf Coast Research and Education Center, in Balm, FL (27° 45′ 37.98″ N, 82° 13′ 32.49″ W) (Figure1). Other data from these field trials were also utilized in previous studies (Fan & Whitaker,2024; Fan et al.,2024; Osorio et al.,2021).

Bare‐root clonal replicates of 1748 different entries across the years were planted in a randomized complete block design with five replications that consists of two beds per replication. The 1748 phenotypes represented 1460 unique individuals including advanced selections and varieties that were repeated across trials (Table1). Each bed was divided into five to eight plots with one cultivar check per plot to account for variation within the bed (columns). Each replication consisted of a single plant (clonal replicate) per genotype. Overlapping genotypes were included across years. The trial site was prepared and maintained following the standard strawberry growing practices in west‐central Florida. Fertilization, weed management, and pest and disease control varied among different seasons according to environmental conditions.

Improvement of DP methods for biomass estimation could also improve selection accuracy for biomass in the future.

Weekly yield and fruit quality data were collected from mid‐November until mid‐March for all trials. During each harvest week, all ripe fruits per plant were removed and evaluated for six yield and fruit quality traits that were divided into two timepoints, early and total season. Early season is the harvest period between late November and January, while the total season is the harvest period between late November and March. The traits evaluated were early marketable yield (EMY; g/plant), total marketable yield (TMY; g/plant), average fruit weight (AWT; g/fruit), total culls (TC; number/plant), soluble solids content (SSC; %), and firmness (FRM; 1–5 score). All marketable fruit were considered as EMY if harvested before the first day of February. TMY was calculated as the marketable fruit collected until the first week of March. AWT in grams was estimated as the TMY divided by the number of marketable fruits. TC, or unmarketable fruit, were counted and expressed as a proportion of the total number of fruits per plant. SSC was measured five times during the season within each trial and was calculated as the mean of all measurements. At each measurement, one ripe fruit from each plant was squeezed by hand onto a handheld digital refractometer. FRM was measured as a score from a scale of 1–5 (Osorio et al.,2021; Whitaker et al.,2012).

A ground‐based imaging platform described by Guan et al. (2020) and Abd‐Elrahman et al. (2020) was utilized to collect high‐resolution RGB and NIR images from the field trials during the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019. Image data were collected at two timepoints that represent the end points of the early season and total season. Canopy size metrics such as plant canopy area, volume, average height, and standard deviation of height were computed using a model used for all datasets acquired throughout the season as described in Abd‐Elrahman et al. (2020).

In the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform was developed to replace the ground‐based imaging platform for image acquisition. A MicaSense RedEdge‐M multispectral camera with a downwelling light sensor (DLS) mounted on a Da‐Jiang Innovations (DJI) Inspire 2 drone was used in this study. Since the UAV is easy to operate and control remotely, it was used to collect image data at more time points (13 and 26 for the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons, respectively) to track the growth of strawberry plants over time. Canopy size metrics and related vegetation indexes were extracted from the UAV imagery for vegetative biomass prediction. Image data processing and comparison between the UAV and ground‐based platform in this study were discussed in C. Zheng et al. (2022a).

Vegetative biomass that represents the early season was labeled as EBIO. Predicted vegetative biomass at the end of the season was labeled as BIO. Fruit yield data such as EMY, TMY, and AWT were then scaled on a biomass basis by dividing EMY, TMY, and AWT by the predicted vegetative biomass, which resulted in new traits of interest, namely, early AWT on a predicted biomass basis (EAWTB), AWT on a predicted biomass basis (AWTB), early marketable yield on a predicted biomass basis (EMYB), and total marketable yield on a predicted biomass basis (TMYB).

The logistic model can be dated back to the work of Verhulst (1838), who proposed a self‐limiting model of population growth with a function or curve representing an S‐shaped curve (Kawano et al.,2020).

As shown in Figure2, the fitted logistic function can reflect the growth trend of strawberry plants. The accumulated biomass was defined as the sum of biomass between the first and last days of data collection during the strawberry winter growing season.

The green shaded area represents the accumulated biomass during the strawberry winter growing season, spanning from the initial to the final days of data collection.

During the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons, the accumulated predicted vegetative biomass (ACCB) was recorded, and AWT as well as TMY were scaled on an ACCB basis (AWT/ACCB and TMY/ACCB, respectively) generating two new traits, AWT on an accumulated predicted vegetative biomass basis (AWTAC) and TMYAC.

Two sets of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were utilized in this study. First, a reference population of 1228 individuals out of a total 1297 genotypes was genotyped using common markers across the Affymetrix Axiom IStraw90 (Bassil et al.,2015) and IStraw35 arrays (Verma et al.,2017). Quality control was implemented on a total of 14,332 segregating SNP markers in which SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.05, and missing marker data > 0.05 were removed, leaving a total of 5300 markers for the analyses. These markers were used for the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons. Missing values for each of the markers were imputed based on average allele frequency. Genotyping of the individuals from seasons 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 was performed utilizing 8749 molecular markers from the newer FanaSNP 50K array (Hardigan et al.,2020), and a similar quality control was implemented. Due to the difference in the marker platforms used, and since different DP methods were used in the first 2 years versus the last 2 years, we took the conservative approach of conducting two analyses, one for 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons and another for 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons, as opposed to combining data across 4 years.

The estimation of the genetic parameters from the advanced selection trials and multi‐year trials followed the two‐stage approach proposed by Smith, Cullis, and Thompson (2001) and implemented in the ASRtriala software (Gezan et al.,2022). These analyses were based on multiple linear mixed models, including the modeling and/or not of spatial model terms, row, column, autoregressive correlated errors, or independent residual units. All spatially adjusted phenotypic data used in this study are available in TableS1.

where∑ct(ρct)and∑rt(ρrt)are spatial correlation structures in the column and row directions, respectively.

There were 14 models tested for each trait within the early and total periods of each year, including the presence or absence of some model factors (TableS2). The best‐fitted model for each trait, period, and year was selected based on the heritability of the prediction error variance (hPEV2), a goodness of fit criterion that is commonly used to compare different models with and/or without spatial factors (TableS3). These single‐stage analyses provide variance components for the random effects, genetic predictions for all genotypes and their corresponding weights (Gezan et al.,2022).

The genotype by year interaction (G×Y) of EBIO, BIO, and the scaled traits EAWTB, AWTB, EMYB, and TMYB were estimated in the second‐stage analyses. The genetic predictions from the first‐stage model, with random genotype effects, were Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) and cannot be used in a multi‐year trial because they were shrunken (Smith, Cullis, & Thompson,2001). Therefore, the previous model was fitted with genotype as a random effect, and the variance components from the first stage were fixed, once it ran, the model is refitted again with genotype fixed to obtain unshrunken genotype predictions. These new predictions are Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs), comparable across trials, and the estimated weights from the stage 1 analyses are included into a weighted linear mixed model in the across‐year analyses (Gezan et al.,2022). Details of the statistical model can be found in Smith, Cullis, and Gilmour (2001) and Gogel et al. (2018). The same procedure was followed to estimate theG×Yinteraction of the same traits from seasons 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022, plus the additional ACCB trait and the scaled traits AWTAC and TMYAC.

The genetic correlations among multiple traits within a season were estimated using the Bayesian multi‐environment model (BME) function of the Bayesian multi‐trait and multi‐environment (BMTME) R software developed by Montesinos‐López et al. (2019). Details on the linear mixed model and the script used to estimate the genetic correlations among traits are presented in the cited article.

Spatially adjusted data generated from the two‐stage analysis of predicted vegetative biomass from 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2020 to 2021 and accumulated biomass from 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 through ASRtriala were used as the phenotype input for GWAS. Analyses were conducted separately by season, using SNP genotypes from a set of common markers across the Affymetrix Axiom IStraw90 (Bassil et al.,2015), IStraw35 (Verma et al.,2017), and FanaSNP 50k (Hardigan et al.,2020) SNP arrays. GWAS analysis was conducted using a Bayesian information and linkage disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway method implemented in GAPIT3 (Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool 3) R package (Wang & Zhang,2021) for both predicted vegetative biomass and accumulated biomass with the inclusion of the top five principal components and markers with MAF > 0.05. Relatedness was accounted for using a kinship matrix estimated with the “VanRaden” algorithm implemented in GAPIT. Significant marker‐trait associations were determined using both 1% and 5% Bonferroni correction.

The phenotypic variation of the predicted vegetative dry biomass during the early and the total season is represented in TableS4. Predicted EBIO ranged from 8.5 to 47 g/plant across years. Predicted BIO ranged from 12.2 to 75.7 g/plant across years. Scaled traits such as EAWTB, EMYB, AWTB, and TMYB ranged from 0.3 to 1.8 g fruit weight/g biomass, 0.0 to 18.7 g marketable weight/g biomass, 0.3 to 1.6 g fruit weight/g biomass, and 0.5 to 31.8 g marketable weight/g biomass, respectively.

The genetic correlations between predicted biomass and marketable yield were positive and low to moderate (rG= 0.16) for the total season in 2017–2018 (Figure3). A similar trend was also seen in the total season in 2018–2019 (rG= 0.40) but was slightly higher than the first season. The genetic correlations between the two seasons for predicted biomass (rG×Y= 0.57, 0.80), AWT (rG×Y= 0.69, 0.87), and marketable yield (rG×Y= 0.60, 0.75) indicated moderate to low genotype by year interactions (FigureS1). Scatter plots, histograms, and phenotypic correlations for the predicted biomass and biomass‐related traits with the fruit yield and quality traits are shown in FigureS2.

Early season showed similar trend as the total season. TMYB, total marketable yield on a predicted biomass basis.

During 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, aside from a different SNP marker set, we were able to access weekly drone image data, which generated another trait, the accumulated predicted vegetative biomass (ACCB), a measure of biomass over several timepoints in a growing season. This is presented as a growth‐related curve in FigureS3. The genetic correlations between biomass and marketable yield were negative and low (rG= −0.13) in 2020–2021 but positive and low in 2021–2022 (rG= 0.14) season (Figure3). The phenotypic correlation for 2020–2021 (FigureS2) between biomass and yield was positive and low, in contrast to the genetic correlation for that season. For ACCB, the genetic correlation with marketable yield was low in 2020–2021 (rG= 0.17) and moderate in 2021–2022 (rG= 0.43). The genetic correlations between the two seasons for ACCB (rG×Y= 0.88), predicted biomass (rG×Y= 0.91), AWT (rG×Y= 0.9), and marketable yield (rG×Y= 0.61) also indicated moderate to low genotype by year interactions (FigureS4).

The heritability of the predicted biomass and biomass‐related traits were moderate to high and comparable with yield traits, withh2= 0.48 andh2= 0.49 for the EBIO 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons, respectively, and withh2= 0.28 andh2= 0.26 for EBIO 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, respectively (Table2). For BIO, heritabilities were similar, withh2= 0.50 andh2= 0.56 for the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons, respectively, andh2= 0.34 andh2= 0.30 for 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, respectively. For ACCB, heritabilities wereh2= 0.27 andh2= 0.27 for 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, respectively. For the predicted biomass scaled traits, the heritability estimates were also moderate to high, with heritability ranging fromh2= 0.25–0.58 across seasons for EAWTB,h2= 0.39–0.60 across seasons for EMYB,h2= 0.44–0.64 across seasons for AWTB, andh2= 0.49–0.64 across seasons for TMYB.

To assess the genetic architecture of predicted biomass, we conducted a genome‐wide association analysis of BIO for the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons (Figure4) and ACCB for the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons (Figure5). Results showed low‐level peaks with no consistent SNPs associated with BIO and ACCB across years. This is evident from the lack of consistent peaks across environments in the Manhattan plots shown in Figures4and5as compared to the high‐level peaks observed from strawberry disease resistance studies like inFaRCa1(Salinas et al.,2019), a major locus that confers resistance to anthracnose fruit rot.

GS was tested as a breeding strategy for predicted vegetative biomass and biomass‐related traits in our breeding program (Table3). Since two different sets of SNP markers were used across years, we generated separate PAs with BRR as the model. The PA for BIO and BIO‐related traits in 2017–2018 (2017–2018 season was used as the training set and 2018–2019 season was used as the testing set) ranged from 0.24 to 0.46. The PA for BIO and BIO related traits in 2020–2021 (2020–2021 season was used as the training set and 2021–2022 season was used as the testing set) ranged from 0.25 to 0.36. The correlation of heritability in 2018 and PA in 2017–2018 was 0.67, while the correlation of heritability in 2021 and PA in 2020–2021 was 0.92, with ACCB included. PA for EAWT, EMY, AWT, and TMY were also included for comparison since those are traits routinely used in GS in the breeding program (Table3).

Vegetative biomass is an important trait to help assess a plant's yield potential. However, traditional measurement of vegetative biomass is destructive and time consuming. In a breeding program, it is essential to collect yield and fruit quality data at every harvest. Thus, destroying field plots to measure biomass manually is not a viable option. With the emergence of DP technologies, it has become possible to estimate vegetative biomass at scale.

The phenotypic and genetic correlations between predicted biomass and marketable yield in both the early season and total season were generally positive but low in magnitude (Figure3). This suggests that fruit yield can be improved without a corresponding increase in plant biomass. The moderate heritability of biomass‐scaled yield also suggests that improvements in yield on a plant biomass basis are quite feasible. Overall, heritability estimates for biomass traits were in similar ranges with yield traits, suggesting that directional selection for biomass will also result in genetic gains (Table2). This is noteworthy since the biomass traits are not ground‐truth measurements. EBIO and BIO are based on size metrics extracted from high‐resolution images that were used to develop a regression model modified from Guan et al. (2020) with an adjustedR2of 0.77. If the accuracy of biomass estimation can be increased, we should expect increases in heritability above what are reported here.

It is important to reiterate that our goal in strawberry breeding is not to increase vegetative biomass. In the strawberry industry, cost of labor is a significant bottleneck with the majority being used on harvesting. Thus, the goal is to select for high‐yielding varieties without simultaneously increasing plant biomass. More biomass could mean a larger canopy and/or increased canopy density. A moderate plant size allows strawberry plants to fit within the desired in‐row spacings that could maximize yield. In addition, plant density must not be increased too much, as air circulation within the plant and the ability for harvesters to visualize fruit under the canopy is critical. Currently, the recommended plant populations in Florida are 16,000–20,000 plants per acre on a two‐row bed with distance of 12–16 in. within row and 12–14 in. between row (Whitaker et al.,2023). A moderate plant size also allows fruits to be more visible and thus helps increase efficiency of manual harvesting in contrast to larger plant size, which tends to hide fruits under its canopy. Thus, it was important to examine scaled traits representing yield‐related traits on plant biomass basis. These scaled traits are meant to capture a roughly similar concept to harvest index, which is the ratio of yield to total harvested aboveground biomass in grain crops (Brandán et al.,2009; Porker et al.,2020; Van Hooijdonk et al.,2018). However, we should also reiterate that the yield traits that we measure are only from marketable fruits, and that our ground truth biomass data do not include reproductive parts and runners but only leaves and stems. The heritability estimates for the biomass‐scaled traits are moderate and thus can be improved in our breeding program.

In 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons, we were able to obtain UAV‐derived biomass data (C. Zheng et al.,2022a). Unlike the ground‐based method, the UAV could be flown weekly to collect image data. This allowed the calculation of ACCB. This trait better reflects the vegetative growth trajectory of a strawberry plant over the season, which may give more in‐depth insights into how vegetative biomass relates to fruit production. Interestingly, in this study, the accumulated biomass traits did not have higher heritabilities or predictive abilities compared to the biomass estimates at single time points. Thus, it is not clear whether weekly UAV imaging can provide additional value over single flights at the end of the early season and total season when predicting vegetative biomass. If more time points do not provide an advantage, they would represent a waste of personnel and computing resources. A study on the rate of growth of individual genotypes using weekly UAV imaging could be a potential trait to explore that could be used in phenomic selection.

GWAS analysis did not reveal consistent peaks across trials. This was not unexpected, as biomass should be controlled by a large number of physiological, biochemical, and genetic factors. This was also a strong indication that genomic prediction would be the best strategy for DNA‐informed breeding for these traits (Clark et al.,2019; Tilhou & Casler,2022; Toda et al.,2021). Predictive abilities for the predicted biomass and biomass‐related traits in this study were similar to the yield traits in a scenario in which one field trial was used to predict the next year's trial. This suggests that genomic prediction can effectively be applied for these traits when predicting untested genotypes in new environments. Therefore, inclusion of vegetative biomass in the multi‐trait index or the use of biomass‐scaled yield traits in GS should help balance genetic gains for fruit and plant traits.

With the advent of DP technologies, we were able to measure aboveground vegetative biomass on a large scale, a trait that we have not measured before in the UF strawberry breeding program. This approach is allowing our program to efficiently balance selection for fruit yield and plant size within the context of GS for the first time. We expect that as additional data are accumulated over seasons, increasing the training population size, predictive abilities will continue to improve. Further improvements in the accuracy of DP methods for biomass estimation could also help improve the accuracy of selection for vegetative biomass traits in the future.
