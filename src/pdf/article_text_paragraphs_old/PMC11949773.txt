The aim of this study was to describe temporal trend of drugs claims after an episode of non‐specific low back pain in Québec between 1997 and 2018, by pharmacological class.

Data came from thePROspective Québec study on work and health(PROQ), the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and Québec hospital services (Med‐Echo). RAMQ common denomination codes were used to identify the types of medication claimed for an episode of non‐specific low back pain. Multivariate log‐binomial regression models were used to evaluate temporal trends in claims for the main pharmacological classes, taking into account dependence between multiple episodes.

A total of 5214 episodes of non‐specific low back pain were identified in 1658 people between 1997 and 2018. The mean age at the first medical service for low back pain was 64.1 years (standard deviation: 8.3 years). Results show a significant increase in opioid claims between 1997 and 1998 (4.1%) and 2009–2010 (12.7%) (pfor trend = 0.0008), anticonvulsants between 1997 and 1998 (0.0%) and 2011–2012 (10.5%) (pfor trend = 0.0002), and myorelaxants between 1997 and 1998 (2.0%) and 2009–2010 (8.8%) (pfor trend < 0.0001), but no significant change in claims for antidepressants between 1997 and 1998 (0.5%) and 2016–2017 (2.6%) (pfor trend = 0.5508).

Claims for opioids, anticonvulsants and myorelaxants for non‐specific low back pain showed significant upward changes between 1997 and 2018 in Québec, in contrast to antidepressants. These temporal variations in claims were different for each group of drugs, with a greater variation for anticonvulsants.

Relieving a patient's back pain remains a major challenge for the clinician, particularly in a context marked by the irrational use of painkillers (Chou and Huffman2007; Fields2011). The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends gradual prescription of pain medication, starting with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids (Vargas‐Schaffer2010). However, for more than a decade, an 'opioid crisis' has been unfolding in several parts of the world due to the excessive use of these drugs, often resulting in overdose deaths (Hancocks2019; Hornberger and Chhatwal2021; Krausz et al.2021). Some of these opioid users are victims of misguided prescribing by healthcare professionals (Khan et al.2019; Lev et al.2016; Manchikanti and Kaye2016; Skolnick2018). In addition to opioids, antidepressants and anticonvulsants prescribed for pain also contribute to overdose deaths (Chaves et al.2022; Darke et al.2022; Soni and Walters2019; Tharp et al.2019).

In recent years, there has been an upward trend in the prescription of opioids in several countries around the world. In the United States, the use of prescription opioids increased by 7.2% between 1999 and 2016 (Stokes et al.2019). However, recent estimates in the United States (2015–2020) show an overall downward trend in opioid prescribing (IQVIA2020). In line with this trend, opioid use in Australia increased by 0.6% between 2013 and 2018, and decreased by 0.3% after 2018 (Lalic et al.2019). In Canada, there has been an overall decrease in the prevalence of opioid prescribing from 13.1% in 2015 to 11.5% in 2020 (Pierre and Daniel2023). Furthermore, the effects of opioids were more noticeable in Canada's English‐speaking provinces and territories, which had the highest prescription prevalence in the country (up to 16.3% of opioids dispensed in pharmacies in the city of Edmonton in 2015) (Pierre and Daniel2023). In the province of Québec, Health Canada statistics show that the prevalence of opioid prescribing fell from 11.6% in 2015 to 10.0% in 2020 (Pierre and Daniel2023). Guidelines have been established to provide a better framework for prescribing different classes of pain medication (Bussières et al.2008; CIHI2023). In the specific case of low back pain, a treatment guide has been developed to assist clinicians (Kreiner et al.2020; Qaseem et al.2017).

In the Canadian context, and more specifically in Québec, there is very limited information on the use of pain medication in adults with low back pain, particularly with regards to opioids. Although prescribing trends have been described globally (Encinosa et al.2022; Gorfinkel et al.2022; Hwang et al.2016; Kantor et al.2015; Meng et al.2013; Noordam et al.2015; Piper et al.2018; West et al.2015), it is less clear how the use of opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and myorelaxants has evolved in people with non‐specific low back pain. Tracking these trends would provide a better understanding of changes in prescribing practices over time. In addition, the introduction of new molecules such as duloxetine (Knadler et al.2011), gabapentin and pregabalin (Robertson et al.2019) to treat patients with non‐specific low back pain, as well as advances in knowledge, have most likely led to changes in prescribing behaviour. It is therefore necessary to examine changes over time not only in the prevalence of opioid claims, but also in that of other pharmacological classes used for the treatment of pain.

The aim of this study was to describe changes in the prevalence of claims for drugs prescribed for non‐specific low back pain in white‐collar workers of Québec between 1997 and 2018 by main pharmacological class: opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and myorelaxant drugs.

To carry out this study, we took advantage of the opportunity offered by the occupational health research programme of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Québec‐Université Laval. This programme has been instituted and follows a cohort of white‐collar workers calledPROQ (PROspective Québec study on work and health). This is a 24‐year prospective cohort of 9188 white‐collar workers from 19 public and semi‐public organisations in the Québec City region (Trudel et al.2018). The cohort was initiated in 1991–1993 with two follow‐up periods, 8 years (1999–2001) and 24 years (2015–2018) later. The flowchart of the cohort is presented in Appendix 1 in Supporting InformationS1. The sample comprised a wide range of white‐collar jobs, including senior managers (10.4%), professionals (34.1%), technicians (19.7%), clerical workers (32.7%) and other types of jobs (3.2%).

In addition to the data collected from the workers themselves, this study included their medico‐administrative data. These medico‐administrative data consisted of data from the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ), theMaintenance et exploitation des données pour l'étude de la clientèle hospitalière(Med‐Écho), and data from private insurers in the province of Québec (Desjardins, La Capitale and SSQ). In the current study, we did not use data from private insurers because the pharmaceutical data from this source were not complete. RAMQ data consisted of medical services data and pharmaceutical data, and Med‐Écho data consisted of hospital stay data.

Participant selection criteria. MA: medico‐administrative; RAMQ: Régie d'assurance maladie du Québec (Quebec health insurance board).

1st step:Merging the cohort data with the above‐mentioned medico‐administrative data. As the RAMQ pharmaceutical data were available from 1997, we ensured that the medical data were aligned from the same date in order to have complete follow‐up of the participants. We excluded all participants who did not have medico‐administrative data.

2nd step:Excluding participants who did not have a period of eligibility for RAMQ drug insurance between 1997 and 2018. This action made it possible to retain the participants in the cohort who had at least one period of eligibility for RAMQ drug insurance. This period of eligibility corresponded to the period during which the individual was covered by RAMQ for reimbursement of drugs claimed in pharmacies. Individuals eligible for the RAMQ drug insurance plan include people who are not eligible for a private plan or who have only complementary private coverage, people aged 65 or over, recipients of last‐resort financial assistance and other holders of a claims booklet, as well as the children of people insured by the public plan (RAMQ2011).

3rd step:Given that the study focused on drug claims among people suffering from non‐specific low back pain, retaining only cases of low back pain, excluding all other diagnostic codes. To identify cases of low back pain, we applied an identification algorithm that included anyone who had at least one diagnostic code for low back pain in medical or hospital service data between 1997 and 2018 (Ly et al.2023). Cases of low back pain were identified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‐9 and ICD‐10) codes in the Québec and Canadian versions. The list of codes can be found in Appendix 2 in Supporting InformationS1.

4th step:The final step in this selection process was checking whether the low back pain occurred during a period of eligibility for RAMQ drug insurance, which made it possible to finally retain participants for whom data on drug claims were available during an episode of non‐specific low back pain.

The initial idea was to measure the prevalence of drugs requested during the 7 days following a medical visit for low back pain. A descriptive analysis showed that the data included visits for low back pain where the interval between two visits was less than 1 week. Applying the initial strategy could have led to an overlap in the measurement window when the medical visits were fairly close, with the result that the same drug could have been counted twice in the prevalence estimate for two separate medical visits. We thus grouped cases of low back pain with a difference of ≤ 7 days to create 'episodes' of low back pain. An 'episode' could therefore consist of one or more diagnoses of non‐specific low back pain.

To measure prevalence, we looked at drug claims made during and within 7 days of an episode of low back pain. The drugs studied were grouped into four pharmacological classes: opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and myorelaxants. For each drug class, we identified all the drugs, alone or in combination, that can be used to relieve low back pain. We first compiled a list of these drugs based on the literature and expert opinion (Kantor et al.2015; Soprano et al.2020; Stokes et al.2019). We selected drugs that were claimed at least once during the study period, including oral and injectable forms, suppositories, and skin patches. Medications claimed during an episode of low back pain were identified using the common name code (Appendix 3 in Supporting InformationS1). This code is assigned by the RAMQ and refers to the unique scientific name of the drug's active ingredient. We excluded certain opioids prescribed for the treatment of opioid dependence, such as naltrexone. Each drug group was treated dichotomously (e.g., opioids claimed: yes vs. no). The prevalence of claims for drugs in each pharmacological class was measured as the proportion of individuals who claimed at least one drug in that class within 7 days of an episode of low back pain during a 2‐year period. The measure was repeated for the entire follow‐up period, i.e., for 11 observation points.

If the person had been hospitalised for cancer 1 year before the onset of the episode of low back pain or if the person had consulted or had been hospitalised for other musculoskeletal disorders related to the neck, shoulder, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis or arthritis 6 months before the onset of the episode of low back pain, we excluded opioid claims in the estimate of opioid prevalence.

If the person had consulted or had been hospitalised for depression or other mental disorders (anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, and other phobic disorders) 1 year before the onset of the episode of low back pain, we excluded claims for antidepressants in the estimate of the prevalence of antidepressants.

If the person had consulted or had been hospitalised for a diagnosis of epilepsy or bipolar disorder 1 year before the onset of the episode of low back pain, we excluded anticonvulsant claims in the estimate of the prevalence of anticonvulsants.

Finally, if the person had consulted or had been hospitalised for other musculoskeletal disorders related to the neck, shoulder, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and arthritis 6 months before the onset of the episode of low back pain, we also excluded claims for myorelaxants in estimating the prevalence of myorelaxants.

It was also possible to identify the various pathologies mentioned above using the ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 codes of the Québec and Canadian versions (Appendix 4 in Supporting InformationS1).

A descriptive analysis was performed on our sample. Patient age was measured at the time of low back pain diagnosis. Means and standard deviations (SD) were used to describe continuous variables, while frequencies were used for categorical variables. Time trends in claim prevalence during an episode of low back pain and over a 7‐day window following this episode were examined for the different drug groups. The period, composed of the grouping of 2 calendar years to obtain more case of low back pain, was used as the continuous independent variable. Log‐binomial regression was used to perform linear trend tests and the null hypothesis that the slope is equal to 0 was tested. In order to take account of the dependence between observations due to the multiple episodes of low back pain possible for the same individual, a robust variance was calculated using generalised estimating equations (GEE). The proportions per period calculated for visualisation purposes were used to identify, where appropriate, a cut‐off period of different fluctuations within the full study period and the linear trend was tested separately for each cut‐off period. To quantify the changes, we reported prevalence ratios (PRs) for the cut‐off periods of different fluctuations within the full study period. These prevalence ratios correspond to an estimate of the change in the prevalences when comparing time t and time (t‐1) over the selected period. All models were adjusted for age at diagnosis of low back pain. Sensitivity analyses were performed by examining temporal trends over windows of 14 and 28 days following the episode of low back pain. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Inform consent was obtained and the project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec (CHUQ) under the number ‘Project 2012–1674, DR‐002–1409’.

Our study included 1658 people between 1997 and 2018. The mean age of participants at the first diagnosis of low back pain was 64.1 years (SD = 8.3 years). Participants aged 65 and over represented 57.1% of the sample. The proportion of men and women was fairly even, with 50.7% of women.

We identified 5214 episodes of non‐specific low back pain, 66.1% of which occurred in people aged 65 and over, and 53.9% in women. The duration of episodes was one day in 95.9% of participants, and the maximum duration was 43 days. The number of episodes per participant ranged from 1 to 66, with 44.8% of participants having a single episode and 10.6% having 7 or more. During the follow‐up period, the number of people with at least one episode rose from 124 in 1997–1998 (4.2%) to 411 in 2017–2018 (13.9%). Similarly, the total number of episodes rose from 219 in 1997–1998 to 727 in 2017–2018.

Figure2shows that opioids were the most frequently claimed group of drugs between 1997–1998 and 2003–2004, again between 2007–2008 and 2009–2010, and in 2015–2016, with prevalences ranging from 4.1% (1997–1998) to 12.7% (2009–2010). Following opioids, myorelaxants were more frequently claimed than anticonvulsants between 1997–1998 and 2003–2004. However, from 2009 to 2010 onwards, the prevalence of anticonvulsant claims surpassed that of myorelaxants, ranging from 9.2% in 2009–2010 to 11.7% in 2017–2018. After 2001–2002, antidepressants had the lowest number of claims among the pharmacological classes.

Figure3.1shows a significant increase in the prevalence of opioid claims, rising from 4.1% in 1997–1998 to 12.7% in 2009–2010 (prevalence ratio (PR) per period = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09–1.41). No significant trend was observed after 2009–2010 (pfor trend = 0.2688). Claims for antidepressants (Figure3.2) did not change significantly over time (pfor trend = 0.5508). On the other hand, the prevalence of anticonvulsant claims increased from1997‐1998 to 2011–2012 (pfor trend = 0.0002; Figure3.3), rising from 0.0% to 10.5%; the PR per period was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.15–1.57); no trend was observed after 2011–2012 (pfor trend = 0.7360). Finally, claims for myorelaxants also increased significantly between 1997–1998 and 2009–2010, with prevalences of 2.0% and 8.8%, respectively (Figure3.4); the PR per period was 1.25 (95% CI: 1.12–1.39 between 1997–1998 and 2009–2010; Table1).

The aim of this study was to describe changes in the prevalence of claims for opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and myorelaxants in white‐collar workers presenting with one or more episodes of non‐specific low back pain, using medico‐administrative databases from 1997 to 2018. Our results show heterogeneous trends in the prevalence of claims across the four drug groups. Claims of opioids, anticonvulsants, and myorelaxants significant increased over time, while claims for antidepressants remained stable.

The increase in opioid claims observed up to 2010 aligns with findings from several studies on this topic (Chen et al.2022; Elmore et al.2021; Jin et al.2022; Piper et al.2018). However, no significant decrease in opioid claims was observed after 2010. This could be attributed to the 2010‐2011 guidelines, which were not specific enough and generally supported opioid prescribing, offering limited guidance on when opioids should be avoided (Furlan et al.2010; Kahan et al.2011Wilson, & Srivastava, 2011). On the other hand, recent studies (after 2017) have reported a decline in opioid prescribing for pain management in Canada, particularly in Québec (CIHI2019; IQVIA2022). This shift could be explained by the more specific 2017 Canadian guidelines that focused on enhancing patient safety while reducing opioid prescribing (Jason2017). One key recommendation in these guidelines was to optimise non‐opioid pharmacotherapy (e.g., non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs) and non‐pharmacological therapy over opioid use for patients with chronic non‐cancer pain.

Our study is not the only one to report an increase in the use of anticonvulsants for pain management in recent years. Similar observations have been made in other countries, including the United States (Soprano et al.2020) and the United Kingdom (Yu et al.2021). Gabapentinoids (pregabalin and gabapentin) are the main anticonvulsants recently used for pain management, which could explain this increase in the use of this drug class (Bongiovanni et al.2023; Gingras et al.2019; Soni and Walters2019; Viniol et al.2019). This finding may require attention, as the side effects of these anticonvulsants are almost like those of opioids (Driot et al.2019; Molero et al.2019; Shanthanna et al.2017).

Antidepressants did not show any significant variation in claims during the study period. The lack of scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of this pharmacological class to treat low back pain could explain this (Turner and Denny1993). However, a study carried out in the United States showed an upward trend in antidepressant prescriptions for managing moderate to severe pain (Gorfinkel et al.2022). This study focused on the period from 2014 to 2018, in contrast to the present study, which covered a broader timeframe.

Finally, a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of myorelaxant claims was observed during the study period. These results align with those of another study that assessed trends in prescription drug use among adults in the United States (Kantor et al.2015). The authors reported a rise in myorelaxant use, from 1.9% in 1999–2000 to 2.5% in 2011–2012. In contrast, the prevalence figures in the present study were higher, ranging from 2.0% in 1997–1998 to 7.0% in 2017–2018, with a peak of 8.8% in 2009–2010. Our prevalence estimates are more recent, as they span up to 2017–2018, whereas the previous study covered up to 2011–2012. Other studies have also found a substantial increase in myorelaxants use, with prevalence doubling between 2005 and 2016 in people aged over 65, reaching an estimated prevalence of 22.2% in 2016 (Soprano et al.2020).

We had access to medico‐administrative data that provided detailed records of drug claims for the individuals included in the study, allowing for precise identification of drugs dispensed in pharmacies. This contrasts with self‐reported data, which could be affected by information bias. The availability of data over a long period (from 1997 to 2018) and covering a large number of participants further enabled us to assess trends in drug claims across several classes of drugs over time.

One of the main limitations of this study is the absence of indication for the medications claimed in the RAMQ database. To address this, we inferred that the drugs claimed were related to the medical visit based on the dispensing date. This approach may have resulted in an underestimation of our prevalences. However, sensitivity analyses performed using 14‐day and 28‐day windows after the episode of low back pain showed trends similar to those observed with a 7‐day window. Additionally, several studies examining prescribed drugs for a given condition have employed similar inferential methods with varying time intervals (Fortin et al.2022; Lacasse et al.2016). Another potential limitation is the inclusion of participants whose low back pain occurred during a period of eligibility for RAMQ drug insurance, which may have introduced a selection bias. While the RAMQ drug insurance plan predominantly covers people aged 65 and over, those under 65 are generally covered by private insurance, for which we lack data. Nevertheless, the estimates for people aged 65 and over, particularly for opioids, are largely consistent with those for the general population of Québec across all conditions (Pierre and Daniel2023). This finding supports the external validity of our results for the entire adult population in Québec.

Analysis of trends in drug claims for non‐specific low back pain showed significant shifts in prescribing behaviour, with a general upward trend across all pharmacological classes, except for antidepressants. While opioids remained the most frequently prescribed class for managing low back pain, our study showed a notable increase in the prescription of anticonvulsants for this condition in the province of Québec. More recent data would be necessary to confirm these findings and potentially uncover new insights regarding the use of these drugs classes.
