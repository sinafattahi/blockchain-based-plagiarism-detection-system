Sentence 1:
: Lithium is a cornerstone in the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD).

==================================================

Sentence 2:
However, lithium use requires careful monitoring of thyroid function due to associated dysfunctions.

==================================================

Sentence 3:
aim of our real-world study is to retrospectively evaluate the impact of lithium on thyroid func-

==================================================

Sentence 4:
tion and how these thyroid alterations can be measured and managed.

==================================================

Sentence 5:
Methods : A retrospective observational study was performed on 150 patients with BD who started lithium treatment at the

==================================================

Sentence 6:
University Hospital of Siena.

==================================================

Sentence 7:
Thyroid function was assessed at baseline and after the introduction

==================================================

Sentence 8:
of lithium by measuring TSH, T3, and T4 levels at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, during

==================================================

Sentence 9:
which changes in psychiatric symptoms were also evaluated using specific psychometric scales.

==================================================

Sentence 10:
Results : Significant increases in TSH levels were observed at 3 and 6 months, while T3 and T4 levels decreased significantly at 3 months.

==================================================

Sentence 11:
Transient thyroid dysfunction occurred in 36.7% of patients,

==================================================

Sentence 12:
but normalized without the discontinuation of lithium or need for thyroid replacement therapy in

==================================================

Sentence 13:
most cases; however, replacement therapy was initiated in 8.7% of patients.

==================================================

Sentence 14:
There were no significant

==================================================

Sentence 15:
differences in treatment response between patients with and without thyroid abnormalities, as the

==================================================

Sentence 16:
abnormalities were transient or resolved.

==================================================

Sentence 17:
Conclusions:  In our sample, lithium induced some cases of hypothyroidism, which, being transient or corrected with replacement therapy, did not interfere with

==================================================

Sentence 18:
symptomatic improvement.

==================================================

Sentence 19:
These findings underscore the necessity for continuous thyroid function

==================================================

Sentence 20:
monitoring during lithium therapy.

==================================================

Sentence 21:
Clinicians should be prepared to initiate thyroid replacement

==================================================

Sentence 22:
therapy, when necessary, as timely management can prevent the interruption of lithium treatment

==================================================

Sentence 23:
and ensure ongoing symptomatic improvement in BD patients.

==================================================

Sentence 24:
Future studies could include larger

==================================================

Sentence 25:
and more diverse populations to validate these findings further, extending the follow-up period

==================================================

Sentence 26:
beyond 12 months to better observe long-term thyroid function trends and management outcomes.

Keywords:  lithium; hypothyroidism; bipolar disorder

==================================================

Sentence 28:
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a significant mental health condition affecting over 1% of the global population [

==================================================

Sentence 29:
This disorder presents with distinct clinical features, including manic and depressive episodes, and sometimes mixed features that exhibit symptoms of opposite

==================================================

Sentence 30:
polarities within the same episode [

==================================================

Sentence 31:
The chronicity and complexity of BD contribute to its underdiagnosis and significant clinical and socioeconomic burden [

==================================================

Sentence 32:
Studies show that many patients with BD experience symptoms approximately 50% of the time over

==================================================

Sentence 33:
follow-up periods exceeding ten years [

==================================================

Sentence 34:
Comorbidity further complicates the diagnosis and treatment of BD [7,8].

==================================================

Sentence 35:
Pharmacological treatments for BD include mood stabilizers like lithium, antipsy-

==================================================

Sentence 36:
chotics, and anticonvulsants [

==================================================

Sentence 41:
robust evidence supporting its mood-stabilizing effects, which extend to both manic and depressive episodes, as well as its anti-suicidal efficacy [

==================================================

Sentence 42:
The BALANCE study con- firmed lithium’s efficacy in preventing relapse and reducing suicidality in BD patients [

==================================================

Sentence 43:
A comprehensive systematic review by Fountoulakis et al.

==================================================

Sentence 44:
10  ] reviewed the evidence con- cerning lithium’s efficacy in various phases and clinical facets of BD, supporting lithium’s

==================================================

Sentence 45:
usefulness across a broad spectrum of clinical issues in BD, particularly in treating acute

==================================================

Sentence 46:
mania, including cases with psychotic symptoms.

==================================================

Sentence 47:
The review also supports the use of

==================================================

Sentence 48:
lithium in combination therapies, such as with olanzapine and quetiapine, in conditions

==================================================

Sentence 49:
such as mixed states [10].

==================================================

Sentence 50:
Lithium’s mechanism of action in treating BD involves inhibiting glycogen synthase

==================================================

Sentence 51:
β  (GSK-3 β ), impacting neuronal plasticity, neuroprotection, and mood regula- tion [

==================================================

Sentence 52:
It modulates neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, oxidative metabolism, apoptosis, and second messenger systems, contributing to mood stabilization [

==================================================

Sentence 53:
Lithium protects neurons from excitotoxicity [

==================================================

Sentence 54:
15  ] and affects intracellular calcium homeostasis [  16  ].

==================================================

Sentence 55:
It reduces tau phosphorylation, potentially benefiting neurodegenerative conditions [

==================================================

Sentence 56:
17 ], and normalizes intracellular sodium levels [

==================================================

Sentence 57:
Lithium influences gene transcription through the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) [

==================================================

Sentence 58:
19  ] and may increase brain structure volumes involved in emotional regulation [

==================================================

Sentence 59:
It also enhances neuropro- tective proteins like BDNF and Bcl-2, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation [20].

==================================================

Sentence 60:
Lithium is concentrated in the thyroid at levels three to four times higher than in the

==================================================

Sentence 61:
This drug reduces the uptake of radioiodine in the thyroid of rats and other species, suggesting that it may compete for iodide transport [

==================================================

Sentence 62:
One of the most significant effects of lithium on the thyroid is the inhibition of thyroid hormone release, leading to the

==================================================

Sentence 63:
development of goiter and hypothyroidism [

==================================================

Sentence 64:
This inhibitory effect involves alterations in tubulin polymerization and the inhibition of TSH action on cyclic AMP [

==================================================

Sentence 65:
Additionally, lithium can affect the activity of deiodinases, the enzymes responsible for the conversion of

==================================================

Sentence 66:
thyroid hormones, further contributing to thyroid functional alterations [

==================================================

Sentence 67:
Lithium increases thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies)

==================================================

Sentence 68:
if present before therapy but does not cause de novo synthesis of antibodies in animals

==================================================

Sentence 69:
Lithium might be associated with a range of thyroid dysfunctions, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis.

==================================================

Sentence 70:
The frequency of these dysfunctions varies, with hypothyroidism being the most common, affecting 6–52% of

==================================================

Sentence 71:
patients on lithium therapy [

==================================================

Sentence 72:
Thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism are less common but still significant, with a prevalence of about 0.5–10% for hyperthyroidism [

==================================================

Sentence 73:
Persistent hypothyroidism is more common than transient forms, with women, particularly those

==================================================

Sentence 74:
with pre-existing thyroid autoimmunity, a family history of thyroid disease, or a history

==================================================

Sentence 75:
of postpartum thyroiditis, being at higher risk [

==================================================

Sentence 76:
Additionally, factors such as the duration and cumulative dose of lithium therapy have been implicated as risk factors,

==================================================

Sentence 77:
where prolonged exposure increases the likelihood of developing thyroid dysfunction [

==================================================

Sentence 78:
Age also plays a role, with older adults being more susceptible to lithium-induced thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 79:
Studies suggest that about 20–30% of patients on long-term lithium therapy may require thyroid hormone replacement due to the development of clinically

==================================================

Sentence 80:
significant hypothyroidism [27].

==================================================

Sentence 81:
The impact of lithium on thyroid function has also been studied in the context of ultra-

==================================================

Sentence 82:
sonographic changes in the thyroid gland, with findings indicating alterations in thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 83:
volume and morphology in lithium-treated individuals [

==================================================

Sentence 84:
Moreover, the potential reversibility of lithium-associated hypothyroidism upon the discontinuation of lithium

==================================================

Sentence 85:
treatment underscores the dynamic nature of lithium’s effects on thyroid function [30].

==================================================

Sentence 86:
Thyroid function monitoring should begin before starting lithium treatment and

==================================================

Sentence 87:
continue with checks every 3–6 months during the first year of therapy, and then every

==================================================

Sentence 88:
6–12 months thereafter.

==================================================

Sentence 89:
The minimum required test is the thyroid-stimulating hormone

==================================================

Sentence 93:
In a 2006 study, it was found that 38% of patients with bipolar disorder treated pri- marily with lithium developed abnormalities in TSH and/or free thyroxine index (FTI)

==================================================

Sentence 94:
Additionally, these patients spent significantly longer in the acute phase of treat-

==================================================

Sentence 95:
ment and showed higher average scores on the Hamilton Scale for Depression during the

==================================================

Sentence 96:
A significant correlation was found between the duration of lithium

==================================================

Sentence 97:
treatment and the development of abnormal thyroid values [32].

==================================================

Sentence 98:
The aim of this study was to explore the potential effects of lithium on thyroid function

==================================================

Sentence 99:
in a real-world cohort of bipolar disorder patients, focusing on how these changes can be

Sentence 344:
The bootstrap approach

provided additional confidence in the model’s findings [33].

==================================================

Sentence 346:
For the model using lithium serum levels, the bootstrap estimate for the effect of

Sentence 347:
lithium on thyroid dysfunction was 0.290, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from

Sentence 348:
0.063 to 0.367 using the bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) method [

==================================================

==================================================

Sentence 350:
These intervals largely confirmed the original model’s

However, with appropriate management, these thyroid

Sentence 376:
These findings emphasize the critical importance of continuous monitoring of thyroid

Sentence 378:
Our data indicated statistically significant increases in

Sentence 379:
TSH levels within the first three and six months of treatment, with some patients exhibiting

==================================================

Sentence 380:
transiently elevated TSH levels.

==================================================

Sentence 381:
Given these results, it is advisable to adopt a monitoring

==================================================

Sentence 382:
schedule that includes more frequent checks during the first year of lithium therapy—every

==================================================

Sentence 383:
three to six months—followed by regular bi-annual assessments.

==================================================

Sentence 384:
This aligns with the

==================================================

Sentence 385:
guidelines from the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) [

==================================================

Sentence 386:
35  ], the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [

==================================================

Sentence 387:
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [  37  ], which recommend regular monitoring of thyroid function during lithium treatment.

==================================================

Sentence 388:
monitoring protocols should be tailored to individual patient needs, considering other

==================================================

Sentence 389:
concurrent medical conditions and therapies.

==================================================

Sentence 390:
Our study also observed a significant linear decrease in MADRS and MRS scores from

==================================================

Sentence 391:
the first observation point at three months, indicating clinical improvement in depressive

==================================================

Sentence 392:
Importantly, this improvement occurred regardless of the presence of transient

==================================================

Sentence 393:
thyroid abnormalities.

==================================================

Sentence 394:
In cases where severe and symptomatic thyroid dysfunctions arose,

==================================================

Sentence 395:
they were effectively managed with thyroid replacement therapy.

==================================================

Sentence 396:
This highlights that with

==================================================

Sentence 397:
proper management, lithium-induced thyroid dysfunction does not necessarily compromise

==================================================

Sentence 398:
the overall efficacy of treatment for BD.

==================================================

Sentence 399:
Clinicians should therefore be vigilant in managing

==================================================

Sentence 400:
thyroid issues to maintain the continuity and success of lithium therapy.

==================================================

Sentence 401:
Previous studies have shown a correlation between thyroid function and treatment

==================================================

Sentence 402:
response in BD, with lower thyroid function and higher TSH levels associated with longer

==================================================

Sentence 403:
times to remission and slower response to treatment.

==================================================

Sentence 404:
Patients with an optimal thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 405:
profile have been shown to experience better outcomes [

==================================================

Sentence 406:
For example, Fagiolini and colleagues observed that patients who developed abnormal TSH levels during treatment

==================================================

Sentence 407:
spent more time in the acute phase of the illness and exhibited higher depressive scores [

==================================================

Sentence 408:
These findings are consistent with the overlap between clinical manifestations of thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 409:
dysfunction and depressive symptoms.

==================================================

Sentence 410:
In our study, the temporary nature of hypothy-

==================================================

Sentence 411:
roidism or the prompt treatment of hypothyroidism, enabled by close monitoring, likely

==================================================

Sentence 412:
mitigated the impact of thyroid dysfunction on depressive symptoms.

==================================================

Sentence 413:
there is considerable literature on the impact of hypothyroidism on depressive symptoms

==================================================

Sentence 414:
in major depressive disorder (MDD), evidence regarding its influence on bipolar depression

==================================================

Sentence 415:
Our study aligns with the broader literature that demonstrates a link between lithium

==================================================

Sentence 416:
therapy and thyroid function alterations [

==================================================

Sentence 417:
Meanwhile, another study observed that up to 47% of patients developed subclinical hypothyroidism within the first two years

==================================================

Sentence 418:
of lithium treatment, with a smaller percentage progressing to overt hypothyroidism [

==================================================

Sentence 419:
2024 ,  17 , 1425  10 of 16

==================================================

Sentence 420:
Additionally, another study conducted over 15 months showed that the prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism during lithium treatment was 10.4% [

==================================================

Sentence 421:
Additionally, a previously mentioned study showed a prevalence of abnormal FTI and TSH levels in 38% of bipolar

==================================================

Sentence 422:
patients treated with lithium [32].

==================================================

Sentence 423:
In our study, we found that 8.67% of patients undergoing lithium treatment developed

==================================================

Sentence 424:
clinical hypothyroidism.

==================================================

Sentence 425:
This finding aligns with the broader literature, including a study

==================================================

Sentence 426:
that reported that over 20% of patients developed hypothyroidism within the first year

==================================================

Sentence 427:
of lithium treatment [

==================================================

Sentence 428:
Additionally, a comprehensive meta-analysis indicated that lithium treatment significantly increases the odds of developing clinical hypothyroidism,

==================================================

Sentence 429:
with an odds ratio of 5.78 compared to non-users [

==================================================

Sentence 430:
Regarding patients who developed subclinical hypothyroidism, as indicated by elevated TSH levels along with normal T3

==================================================

Sentence 431:
and T4 values, but which resolved without the need for replacement therapy, none of

==================================================

Sentence 432:
the patients in our cohort reported any symptoms of hypothyroidism.

==================================================

Sentence 433:
important to highlight that even short-term hypothyroidism might lead to fatigue, weight

==================================================

Sentence 434:
gain, depression, cognitive impairment, and cold intolerance, which can impair daily

==================================================

Sentence 435:
functioning and overall well-being [

==================================================

Sentence 436:
Therefore, it is crucial to track and monitor even subclinical and/or transient hypothyroidism to ensure it does not negatively impact the

==================================================

Sentence 437:
patient’s quality of life.

==================================================

Sentence 438:
Lithium is known to concentrate in the thyroid at higher levels than in the plasma,

==================================================

Sentence 439:
potentially inhibiting thyroid hormone release and affecting iodide transport, deiodinase

==================================================

Sentence 440:
activity, and TSH action [

==================================================

Sentence 441:
These effects contribute to goiter, hypothyroidism, and increased thyroid autoimmunity, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions.

==================================================

Sentence 442:
However, it is also important to consider that bipolar disorder itself has been associated

==================================================

Sentence 443:
with thyroid function alterations.

==================================================

Sentence 444:
Some studies suggest that patients with bipolar disorder

==================================================

Sentence 445:
are more likely to have thyroid dysfunction compared to the general population, especially

==================================================

Sentence 446:
in those with refractory and rapid-cycling forms of the disorder [

==================================================

Sentence 447:
Disruptions in the hypothalamo–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis, which plays a critical role in mood regulation,

==================================================

Sentence 448:
may significantly impact the clinical course of bipolar disorder.

==================================================

Sentence 449:
Both hyperthyroidism and

==================================================

Sentence 450:
hypothyroidism are linked to mood disturbances, with hyperthyroidism often associated

==================================================

Sentence 451:
with anxiety and mood lability, and hypothyroidism with depressive symptoms [51].

==================================================

Sentence 452:
Additionally, the potential impact of other medications taken by our patients as part

==================================================

Sentence 453:
of their therapy must be considered, as these can also affect thyroid function in clinical

==================================================

Sentence 454:
In conclusion, our study found that transient thyroid abnormalities in most patients

==================================================

Sentence 455:
normalized over time without the need to discontinue lithium or initiate long-term thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 456:
replacement therapy.

==================================================

Sentence 457:
This finding is crucial for the continued prescribability of lithium, a

==================================================

Sentence 458:
cornerstone in the treatment of bipolar disorder known for its effectiveness across all phases

==================================================

Sentence 459:
and its anti-suicidal properties.

==================================================

Sentence 460:
Despite its narrow therapeutic index and potential side

==================================================

Sentence 461:
effects, including thyroid dysfunction, lithium remains a vital treatment option.

==================================================

Sentence 462:
ings reinforce the importance of careful monitoring and management of thyroid function

==================================================

Sentence 463:
during lithium therapy, enabling many patients to continue benefiting from this essential

==================================================

Sentence 464:
Clinicians should be well prepared to address and manage potential side effects,

==================================================

Sentence 465:
such as hypothyroidism, to ensure the continued effectiveness and tolerability of lithium

==================================================

Sentence 466:
in treating bipolar disorder.

==================================================

Sentence 467:
Our findings underscore the critical importance of vigilant

==================================================

Sentence 468:
monitoring and management of thyroid function during lithium therapy.

==================================================

Sentence 469:
found that a well-balanced approach, involving thyroid function tests every three months

==================================================

Sentence 470:
during the first year, was effective in enabling many patients to continue benefiting from

==================================================

Sentence 471:
this essential treatment without significant thyroid-related complications.

==================================================

Sentence 472:
be well prepared to address and manage potential side effects, such as hypothyroidism, to

==================================================

Sentence 473:
ensure the continued effectiveness and tolerability of lithium in treating bipolar disorder.

==================================================

Sentence 474:
is important to note that early diagnosis of lithium-induced hypothyroidism, followed by

==================================================

Sentence 475:
prompt treatment with thyroid replacement therapy, can allow lithium to remain effective

==================================================

Sentence 476:
in bipolar patients, as demonstrated in our sample.

==================================================

Sentence 516:
Scale (MADRS), and Mania Rating Scale (MRS), which were used in current clinical practice

==================================================

Sentence 517:
at day 0, month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12 of lithium treatment.

==================================================

Sentence 518:
was assessed by blood chemistry tests with the determination of TSH, T3, and T4 levels at

==================================================

Sentence 519:
day 0, month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12, respectively.

==================================================

Sentence 520:
There were no missing data

==================================================

Sentence 521:
for any of these variables, and consequently, no methods of data imputation were applied

==================================================

Sentence 522:
before modeling the thyroid status over time.

==================================================

Sentence 523:
The tolerability and the presence of any side

==================================================

Sentence 524:
effects to medications or symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, and

==================================================

Sentence 525:
cold intolerance, were assessed at each time point during the patient’s clinical visit.

==================================================

Sentence 526:
Statistical Analysis

==================================================

Sentence 527:
Descriptive statistics for dichotomous and ordinal variables are given as counts and percentages, while those for quantitative variables are given as the mean, standard deviation

==================================================

Sentence 528:
(SD), minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

==================================================

Sentence 529:
Changes from baseline

==================================================

Sentence 530:
in thyroid status, categorized as normal, subclinical, or hypothyroidism based on TSH and

==================================================

Sentence 531:
FT4 levels, were analyzed using a cumulative link mixed-effects model (CLMM).

==================================================

Sentence 532:
The cumulative link mixed-effects model (CLMM) provides a detailed analysis of how

==================================================

Sentence 533:
lithium treatment affects thyroid function over time in patients, considering individual

==================================================

Sentence 534:
The model uses an ordinal outcome variable that classifies patients into cate-

==================================================

Sentence 535:
gories of thyroid function: normal, subclinical, and hypothyroidism, based on TSH and T4

==================================================

Sentence 536:
This allows the assessment of changes in the probability of being in a higher thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 537:
dysfunction category over time and with varying lithium levels.

==================================================

Sentence 538:
This approach accounted

==================================================

Sentence 539:
for individual variability by including patients as random effects and examined the impact

==================================================

Sentence 540:
of time (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) and lithium serum levels on thyroid status.

==================================================

Sentence 541:
According to the approach presented in

==================================================

Sentence 542:
Applied Longitudinal Analysis  by Fitzmau- rice et al., the ordinal random effects model can be written as follows:

==================================================

Sentence 543:
•  Y ij  represents the ordinal thyroid status (normal, subclinical hypothyroidism, clinical hypothyroidism) for patient i at observation j;

==================================================

Sentence 544:
•  k  indexes the ordinal categories with  k  =  1, 2, corresponding to the cumulative logit model (i.e., log odds for each threshold);

==================================================

Sentence 545:
 : the cumulative probability of being in category (k) or below, condi-

==================================================

Sentence 546:
tional on random effects;

==================================================

Sentence 547:
ij  is the linear predictor for the k-th cumulative logit;

==================================================

Sentence 548:
•  τ k  represents the threshold (cut-off) parameter for the k-th category;

==================================================

Sentence 549:
β  represents the fixed effects part of the model:

==================================================

Sentence 550:
2024 ,  17 , 1425  13 of 16

==================================================

Sentence 551:
β  =  β 1 X 1ij  +  β 2 X 2ij  +  β 3 X 3ij  +  β 4 X 4i  +  β 5 X 5i  +  β 6 X 6i  +  β 7 X 7i  +  β 8 X 8i

==================================================

Sentence 552:
#  X 1ij  =  month ij ;

==================================================

Sentence 553:
#  X 2ij  =  Li ij ;

==================================================

Sentence 554:
#  X 3ij  =  month ij  ×  Li ij ;

==================================================

Sentence 555:
#  X 4i  =  baseline TSH i ;

==================================================

Sentence 556:
#  X 5i  =  Gender i ;

==================================================

Sentence 557:
#  X 6i  =  Gabapentin/Pregabalin i ;

==================================================

Sentence 558:
#  X 7i  =  Other Antidepressants i ;

==================================================

Sentence 559:
#  X 8i  =  Age of Onset i .

==================================================

Sentence 560:
β  is the vector of fixed effect coefficients corresponding to each covariate in the model—Z

==================================================

Sentence 561:
b i  represents the random effects part of the model, with Z

==================================================

Sentence 562:
b i  =  b i  (1) where

==================================================

Sentence 563:
b i  is the random intercept for patient  i , which accounts for individual variability across patients and is assumed to follow a normal distribution: b

==================================================

Sentence 564:
This formulation captures the hierarchical structure of the data and the ordinal nature

==================================================

Sentence 565:
of the response, where fixed effects

==================================================

Sentence 566:
β  and random effects  Z ij ′

==================================================

Sentence 567:
b i  are combined in the linear predictor

==================================================

Sentence 568:
ij  to model the probability of thyroid status categories.

==================================================

Sentence 569:
The main research question was to determine if, and to what extent, exposure to

==================================================

Sentence 570:
lithium increased the risk of hypothyroidism.

==================================================

Sentence 571:
We began by identifying nine initial models

==================================================

Sentence 572:
that included combinations of the following variables: (1) lithium treatment (measured

==================================================

Sentence 573:
by lithium serum levels and/or oral lithium dose, both with their interactions with time);

==================================================

Sentence 574:
(2) key suspected confounders, such as baseline TSH levels (which were always included).

==================================================

Sentence 575:
At step 0, each of the three models was compared with a null model (with no covari-

==================================================

Sentence 576:
ates) using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

==================================================

Sentence 577:
Following this, a stepwise forward

==================================================

Sentence 578:
selection process was performed for each model, in which potential confounding variables

==================================================

Sentence 579:
were added one by one.

==================================================

Sentence 580:
The variables included in this process were the following: age,

==================================================

Sentence 581:
gender, BMI, education level, ethnicity, age of onset, number of manic episodes, number

==================================================

Sentence 582:
of depressive episodes, age at first manic episode, age at first depressive episode, use of

==================================================

Sentence 583:
mood stabilizers, use of first-, second-, and third-generation antipsychotics, use of benzodi-

==================================================

Sentence 584:
azepines, treatment with gabapentin or pregabalin, treatment with SSRIs, treatment with

==================================================

Sentence 585:
SNRIs, and treatment with other antidepressants.

==================================================

Sentence 586:
We utilized a bootstrap method to evaluate the robustness of our model estimates.

==================================================

Sentence 587:
Bootstrapping is a non-parametric resampling technique that allows for assessing the

==================================================

Sentence 588:
stability of statistical estimates by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original

==================================================

Sentence 589:
In this study, we generated 1000 bootstrap replications of our dataset to estimate

==================================================

Sentence 590:
the distribution of the model parameters [

==================================================

Sentence 591:
For each replication, we refit the model, enabling us to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the main exposure variables

==================================================

Sentence 592:
(lithium serum levels and oral lithium dose) using both the quantile method and the bias-

==================================================

Sentence 593:
corrected accelerated (BCa) bootstrap technique as defined by Efron [

==================================================

Sentence 594:
This process allowed us to confirm the reliability of our findings, with the bootstrap estimates providing

==================================================

Sentence 595:
further validation of the observed effects on hypothyroidism risk.

==================================================

Sentence 596:
The results from this

==================================================

Sentence 597:
bootstrap analysis have been incorporated into our final model output tables.

==================================================

Sentence 598:
The model selection process is resumed in Figure 4.

Limitations and Future Perspectives

==================================================

Sentence 605:
This study on the impact of lithium on thyroid function in patients with bipolar disorder has potential limitations.

==================================================

Sentence 606:
Firstly, it would be beneficial to better understand the

==================================================

Sentence 607:
long-term effects of lithium treatment, as it is a fundamental medication for bipolar disorder

==================================================

Sentence 608:
and is used for extended periods, even during inter-episode phases.

==================================================

Sentence 609:
Moreover, it would be

==================================================

Sentence 610:
useful to expand the sample size, both to increase the numbers and to identify potential

==================================================

Sentence 611:
differences in geographic areas where the incidence of hypothyroidism may differ from

==================================================

Sentence 612:
A significant limitation is that the patients were also on other medications; how-

==================================================

Sentence 613:
ever, rather than demonstrating the well-known correlation between lithium and thyroid

==================================================

Sentence 614:
function alterations, our study aims to show how these alterations can be monitored and

==================================================

Sentence 615:
managed without compromising symptom improvement.

==================================================

Sentence 616:
Another limitation is related to the scope of our inferential research question, which

==================================================

Sentence 617:
was strictly limited to quantifying the effect of lithium on thyroid status.

==================================================

Sentence 618:
focus only on this aspect was driven by the need to avoid unnecessary multiple testing,

==================================================

Sentence 619:
which can reduce statistical power and lead to potential bias.

==================================================

Sentence 620:
While this strategy ensured the

==================================================

Sentence 621:
validity of our primary results, it limited our ability to explore other potentially significant

==================================================

Sentence 622:
variables or outcomes beyond the direct impact of lithium on thyroid function.

==================================================

Sentence 623:
Future studies could include larger and more diverse populations to validate these

==================================================

Sentence 624:
findings further, extending the follow-up period beyond 12 months to better observe

==================================================

Sentence 625:
long-term thyroid function trends and management outcomes.
