The study aimed to explore the differences in physical performance characteristics across various age groups (U14, U16, and U18) and sexes in adolescent team sport athletes.
473 adolescent Norwegian football and handball players were recruited for anthropometrical and physical performance testing.
Performance improved with age in both boys and girls, showing significant differences between age categories.
Across all tests, boys outperformed girls, and the sex difference doubled from U14 to U16, such as −5.1% to −10.3% for 30 m sprint, −5.6% to −9.8% for change of direction (CoD), 11% to 21% for countermovement jump (CMJ), and from 5% to 16% for relative strength.
No further increase in differences between sexes was observed in the U18 age group.
All age groups showed substantial intragroup variability in physical performance tests and anthropometric measures.
The main findings from the study were increased sex differences from U14 to U16, but no further increase in sex difference from U16 to U18s as well as considerable individual variation in performance.
Girls, maturing earlier than boys and showing less physical performance development, may benefit from earlier introduction to strength training to boost their physical development.
Moreover, the considerable individual variation underscores the need for tailored individualized programs.
The study highlights significant effects of both age and sex on physical performance, with greater performance in older age groups and in boys compared to girls.
A considerable increase in the difference between boys and girls was observed from the U14 to the U16 age group, with effect sizes rising from small/moderate to large/very large, but no further increase occurred from U16 to the U18.
The distinctions among age groups and sexes and the large intragroup variation emphasize the importance for targeted training programs and injury prevention measures tailored to the distinct phases during adolescence.
Team sports are characterized by frequent high‐intensity efforts (sprinting, jumping, and changes of direction) separated by bouts of lower intensity, such as walking and jogging (Bradley et al.2009; Póvoas et al.2012).
Consequently, team sport athletes must possess high physical performance levels to compete at a high level.
Proper physical development not only enhances physical performance but is also a cornerstone of holistic injury prevention programs (Buckthorpe et al.2019; Suarez‐Arrones et al.2021).
Adolescence represents a critical period for developing the physical attributes needed to meet the demands of the game.
Most youth teams are mostly organized by chronological age, so understanding physical performance differences across and within age groups is critical to refine training strategies and selection processes applicable to current team structures.
An important aspect in these processes is to consider the influence of growth and maturation, which vary widely among individuals and between sexes during adolescence, affecting the progression and timing of physical development (R. M. Malina et al.2004).
Most existing research on physical development in adolescent athletes focuses on boys, resulting in a considerable gap in understanding how these attributes develop in girls or how development trajectories compare between sexes (Tingelstad et al.2023).
This lack of sex‐specific data hampers our ability to develop targeted training programs and could lead to missed opportunities for optimizing performance or preventing injuries.
Research on team sport athletes demonstrates that older age groups generally outperform their younger counterparts in various physical metrics, including sprint speed and muscle strength, in both boys (Mendez‐Villanueva et al.2011; Mujika et al.2009; Valente‐dos‐Santos, Coelho‐e‐Silva, Martins, et al.,2012) and girls (Byrne et al.2021; Emmonds, Scantlebury, et al.,2020; Söderman et al.2000).
However, the progression in physical performance during adolescence is typically slower and smaller in magnitude in girls compared to boys, as seen in both team sport athletes (Tingelstad et al.2023) as well as the general population (Jones1949; Krahenbuhl et al.1985; R. M. Malina et al.2004; Round et al.1999) and other sports (Tønnessen et al.2015).
This difference is largely attributed to a greater increase in fat mass in girls and muscle mass in boys during puberty (R. M. Malina et al.2004).
Consequently, notable differences in physical performance between boys and girls become apparent from the onset of puberty (Mujika et al.2009) and increase with age (R. Malina et al.2010; Tingelstad et al.2023; Tønnessen et al.2015).
Few studies have examined between‐sex differences in athletes, and especially in team sports, the literature is scarce.
To our knowledge, there are no studies that directly compare sexes and different age groups using a comprehensive test battery in handball or football.
One cross‐sectional study on hurling, camogie, and Gaelic football players found consistently greater performance with age in boys but more varied age trends in girls (Byrne et al.2021).
However, their study was limited to age groups up to U16 for both sexes.
Consequently, there is a need for further research in this area, encompassing a broader age range for both sexes and includes other sports (Tingelstad et al.2023).
Understanding how age and sex differences impact physical performance in adolescent team sport athletes is important to enhance the development of targeted training strategies for physical performance and injury prevention.
Therefore, this study aimed to explore differences in physical performance characteristics across sexes and various age groups in adolescent team sport athletes.
We hypothesized that boys would demonstrate superior physical performance compared to girls within similar age groups and that the differences between age groups would be more pronounced in boys than in girls.
Between 2021 and 2023, this multisite study recruited 471 adolescent Norwegian football and handball players, including boys and girls, from local clubs in the cities of Oslo and Kristiansand.
The participants were represented in three team categories: U14 (12.1–13.8 years, 96 boys, and 121 girls), U16 (14.2–15.9 years, 100 boys, and 77 girls), and U18 (16.4–17.9 years, 46 boys, and 31 girls).
Ethical approval was obtained from the internal ethical committee at the [Institution blinded for review] (Ref nr: 191‐170621) following the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration.
Participants were informed about the research objectives, procedures, and potential risks and benefits.
Written consent was obtained from all participants; for those under 16, parental consent was also given.
Participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any point.
The physical assessments were carried out over 2 days during the competitive season (autumn for football players and spring for handball players), with a minimum of 2 days postmatch.
Day one included anthropometrical measures, including stature, sitting height, and body mass, in addition to testing sprint performance, change of direction (CoD) capabilities, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, leg force and power, eccentric hamstring strength, isometric hip abduction and adduction, and isometric shoulder internal and external rotation.
On the second day, the Yo‐Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test (YYIR1) was conducted to measure intermittent endurance capacity.
Due to logistical challenges and to optimize the testing process, the order of tests varied among participants.
In some cases, specific assessments were deferred to the second day, contributing to the variation of the testing schedule.
It is important to note that not all participants completed every test, leading to variations in the number of participants for each test.
Additionally, limitations in equipment availability led to the exclusion of the hamstring, hip, and shoulder strength tests at one of the testing sites, resulting in a reduced sample size for these tests.
As part of a larger study, data on training hours, injuries, and illness were collected biweekly over 10 weeks for the Oslo group following the testing period, using a modified OSTRC questionnaire (Clarsen et al.2013).
The results reflect the average weekly total and strength training hours between the groups (Appendix Table1) and the biweekly prevalence of health problems during this period.
Height and sitting height were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 cm with the head placed in the Frankfurt horizontal plane.
Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany).
For sitting height, the players sat on a flat hard‐surfaced bench and were instructed to keep their feet off the ground.
Each anthropometric variable was measured twice and then averaged.
If the difference between the two measures was more than 2 mm for height or 2 g for weight, a third measurement was conducted and the median was used (Mirwald et al.2002).
Maturation status, expressed as years from peak height velocity (YPHV), was estimated using the Mirwald et al. (2002) equations, which use height, sitting height, leg length, and chronological age.
It is important to note the significant limitations of this method, particularly its reduced accuracy in very early or late‐maturing individuals and its tendency to underestimate the maturity status in girls (Kozieł and Malina2018).
Although the method is widely used in youth sports due to its noninvasive nature and reported reliability (R2= 0.91) with a standard error of 0.50 years, these limitations must be carefully considered as they can compromise the validity of the results.
Although the method has limitations, it remains a valuable noninvasive tool for estimating biological maturity in adolescent athletes (Mirwald et al.2002).
Based on their calculated maturity offset, the players were grouped as either pre (≤ −0.5 YPHV), mid (≥ −0.5 to 0.5 YPHV), post1 (≥ 0.5 to 1.5 YPHV), or post2 (> 1.5 YPHV).
Following the anthropometrical tests, all subjects performed a standardized warm‐up for about 15 min containing jogging, dynamic mobility, dynamic flexibility, and 3 × 30 m acceleration runs with progressive increasing intensity before proceeding with the physical performance tests.
The 30 m linear sprint was conducted on an indoor track with timing gates positioned at 10, 20, and 30 m. Before starting, participants assumed a split leg position 50 cm behind the starting line.
Each participant performed three sprint attempts, with at least 3 min of rest between each trial (Ronnestad et al.2008).
The best time recorded was used for analysis.
The timing system utilized was Athletics training self‐timer, dual beam photocells (IC control Media and Sport, Sweden) at one test site, and a contact mat with wireless timing gates (Musclelab, Ergotest innovation AS, Norway) at the second test site.
The 30 m sprint speed test has demonstrated high reliability, with acceptable intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.90 to 0.97 (Coelho et al.2015; López‐Segovia et al.2014; Loturco et al.2015) and coefficient of variation (CV) of 1.1%–2.3% (López‐Segovia et al.2014; Loturco et al.2015) among adolescent football players.
Change of direction ability was assessed using a modified version of the A180° (Sporis et al.2010).
The starting procedure and equipment were the same as for the sprint test.
Subjects began accelerating 12.5 m before performing four 180° turns with five m in‐between, all with the same foot, before finishing at the 20 m line, for a total of 40 m. They had four attempts each: two turning with the dominant foot and two turning with the nondominant foot, with the fastest attempt used for analysis.
The rest between attempts was 3 min.
Single‐beamed timing gates with infrared photocells (Brower Timing Systems, Draper, USA) were used at the second test site.
The test is well‐suited and reliable for change of direction ability among football players, with an ICC of 0.95 and CV of 5.1% (Sporis et al.2010).
Vertical jump abilities were tested with a CMJ on a portable force platform (HUR Labs Oy, Tampere, Finland; and AMTI: Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Waltham Street, Watertown, USA at the second testing site).
The players were instructed to stand on the platform with a shoulder‐width foot placement, with hands on their hips.
Then, a CMJ was performed with a self‐selected depth.
Each player had at least three attempts with 15–20 s rest between, but if the third jump was significantly higher than the preceding, they were given an additional effort.
The highest jump was used for analysis.
When compared to the gold standard mounted floor force platform, the force platform has good concurrent validity within 1 cm (2%) (Buckthorpe et al.2012) and a 2.2%–3.5% within‐subject CV (López‐Segovia et al.2014; Loturco et al.2015; Markovic et al.2004).
A Keiser leg press machine (Keiser A300, Keiser Co.
Inc., USA) was used to measure lower body force and power.
The protocol involved progressively increasing loads and rest between repetitions toward failure, with a knee angle in the bottom position set as close to 90° as possible, measured with a goniometer (Grendstad et al.2020; Redden et al.2018).
The resistance increased incrementally at equal percentage intervals, based on each player's estimated one‐repetition maximum (1RM), derived through visual observation and previous experience.
Average power (Watt) and force (Newton), absolute and normalized to body mass, were used for the statistical analysis.
These variables were retrieved from a software (NIH Keiserdatabase, Norway) calculating theoretical average peak force and power based on the individual data points from the test fitted on a regression line (Lindberg et al.2021).
The test demonstrates good levels of reliability in assessing lower extremity force (ICC = 0.91, average, and typical error = 4.2%) and power output (ICC = 0.86 and TE = 5.4%) among football players (Redden et al.2018).
Specific exclusion criteria for theoretical average peak force were applied during the analysis to ensure data accuracy and reliability: a difference of > 30% between the measured and predicted average values from the regression line.
Thirty‐five subjects were found to exceed a 30% difference and were excluded from the analysis.
A Nordic hamstring testing device (NordBord v.
1.0, VALD performance, Albion, Australia) assessed maximal eccentric hamstring strength through Nordic hamstring curls.
Warm‐up and familiarization involved three submaximal repetitions, followed by three repetitions with maximum effort, striving to hold as steadily and extensively as possible.
A 10 s rest interval separated each repetition, and any repetition with excessive hip flexion was not counted.
The average of the best effort for the left and the right leg was used for statistical analysis (Amundsen et al.2022; Buchheit et al.2016).
The NordBord has shown good reliability with an ICC of 0.96 (Freeman et al.2018), typical error of 5.8%–8.5%, and a minimal detectable change of > 60 N (Opar et al.2013).
Isometric (ISO) hip adduction (ADD) and abduction (ABD) were assessed in a long lever hip position with 0° hip flexion using the ForceFrame system (VALD performance, QLD) device.
Before assessment, two warm‐up repetitions were completed at 70% and 90% effort, followed by three maximum effort repetitions.
Each repetition consisted of a 5 s hip adduction immediately followed by a 5 s hip abduction, with a 10 s rest interval between repetitions (O'Brien et al.2019).
The average of the maximal result for the left and the right side was used in the analysis.
The ForceFrame's hip adduction test for football players is reliable, with an ICC of 0.85 and 0.82 and SEM of 8.2% and 6.2% for adduction and abduction, respectively (Desmyttere et al.2019).
The ForceFrame device was also used to assess isometric strength in external (ER) and internal (IR) shoulder rotation.
Players lay with legs extended, shoulders abducted, and elbows flexed at a 90° angle beneath the sensor.
The heel of the palm rested on the pad, and they were instructed to keep their elbow on the floor during the test.
Measurements were taken only for the player's dominant arm, the one they would use for throwing.
The testing procedure was identical to hip adduction and abduction, always starting with internal rotation, followed by external rotation.
The best attempt from each external and internal rotation was selected for analysis.
The reliability of internal and external shoulder rotation with the ForceFrame has been established as good, with ICC of 0.92 and 0.85, respectively (Couch et al.2021).
The Yo‐Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 is an intermittent endurance test with increasing speed in intervals for assessing intermittent endurance performance.
The players ran 20 m, turned 180°, returned to the starting line, and got 10 s active rest before the next run.
Not being able to continue or receiving two warnings resulted in the termination of the test.
Warnings were received when (i) starting before the signal, (ii) not touching the turning line, or (iii) not being back in time before the time was out.
The test was selected because of its good reliability and validity (ICC of 0.87–0.95 and CV = 4.9%) for assessing team sport‐specific endurance (Deprez et al.2015; Krustrup et al.2003).
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for physical performance and anthropometrics for all groups.
To account for equipment differences between the two study sites, a correction factor was added to the sprint (0.21 s), CoD (0.68 s), and CMJ (2.96 cm) test results from the second study site.
The correction factor was calculated as the difference in means in the U14 girls' (the largest sample) results between study sites for each test.
The calculated correction was then added to individual test results to standardize data across sites.
In addition to normalizing results by body weight, allometric scaling was applied to leg press force and power and hamstring, hip adduction/abduction, and shoulder rotation strength, using an exponent of 0.67 as described in previous work (Atkins2004).
One‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the differences in physical characteristics, anthropometrics, and training volume between annual‐age categories with a Tukey post hoc test, whereas a two‐way ANOVA was used for between‐sex differences.
Association between sex for injury prevalence was determined using an ANOVA test.
The level of significance was set atp< 0.05.
Effect sizes (ES) were calculated to assess the magnitude of the differences and interpreted as: < 0.2 (trivial), 0.2–0.6 (small), 0.6–1.2 (moderate), 1.2–2.0 (large), and > 2.0 (very large) (Hopkins et al.2009).
Inferential statistical analysis were performed using R Studio (Version: 2023.12.0 + 369), while descriptive statistics such as means, SD, and percentage change, were analyzed in Microsoft Excel.
Table1shows data from anthropometric measures and physical tests of adolescent team sport players by sex and age group (U14s, U16s, and U18s), and effect sizes are shown in Table2.
A significant age effect was observed for all boys' anthropometrics and physical characteristics (p< 0.05 and ES = 0.88 − 3.69), except relative strength in hamstring and internal and external shoulder rotation.
Girls also showed significant differences between age groups in most variables (p< 0.05 and ES = 0.52 − 2.98), except relative force and relative strength in hamstring, hip adduction, and external shoulder rotation.
When allometric scaling was applied (Table3), more variables significantly differed between age groups than when scaled to body mass.

Age differences were more prominent in boys compared to girls for relative power (leg press relative power and CMJ) and total force (leg press total force, eccentric hamstring, ISO shoulder ER/IR, and ISO hip ADD/ABD) variables (means of means).
Boys exhibited a difference of 40% in relative power and 73% in relative force between the U14 and U18 age groups compared to 28% and 37% in girls, respectively.
Figures1and2illustrate the intragroup variability for all participant groups across several measures: 30 m sprint, CoD, relative power, YYIR1, CMJ, eccentric hamstring strength, stature, and body mass.
These data highlight substantial variations in performance within each group, particularly pronounced in the youngest age category.

A significant interaction effect between sex and age was found for all anthropometrical variables and most physical characteristics (Table4).
Post hoc tests showed boys exhibiting greater height and limb length in both the U16 and U18 age groups and higher body mass in the oldest age group (Table4).
These differences yielded moderate to very large ES (Table4).

* = Significant difference between boys and girls (p< 0.05).
Boys performed consistently better than girls across all ages in 10 and 30 m sprint, CoD, CMJ, YYIR1, total, and relative power.
In the U16 and U18 age groups, all tests except relative hamstring strength were significantly different between the sexes.
Notably, fewer significant differences between sexes were observed among the U14s, with generally small to moderate effect sizes, but ranged from primarily large to very large in both the U16 and U18 age group (Table4).
Additionally, there was a more pronounced ES between the U14s and U16s in boys, whereas the U16 and U18 groups presented similar age differences between sexes (Table2).
Data on health problems and average weekly training volume are presented in Appendix Table1.
The response rate for the monitored weeks was 67 ± 5%.
Although the overall weekly prevalence of health problems and injuries was similar between the sexes, girls had a significantly higher prevalence of overuse injuries (p= 0.013).
Boys had a significantly greater volume of both total and gym training, and significant effects of both age and sex were observed (p< 0.05).
Like in the age group comparisons, boys performed significantly better than girls across most physical tests around time for PHV (mid group) and across all tests in the two maturity levels after PHV (post1 and post2).
Boys were significantly taller and heavier than girls at these maturity levels (Appendix Table2).
Sex comparisons before time at PHV were not possible because all girls had passed the “pre PHV” level, whereas 62 boys were in this category (Appendix Table2).
This study aimed to investigate age and sex differences in physical performance and body measurements among adolescent football and handball players, addressing a research gap, particularly for girls across a broad age range.
Both boys and girls demonstrated significant effects of age on physical characteristics but with distinct patterns.
Boys showed the largest age‐related differences between U14 and U16 across most characteristics, whereas girls exhibited greater differences between U16 and U18.
Notably, although boys consistently demonstrated larger effect sizes than girls between U14 and U16 for all physical traits, the differences were more comparable between sexes from U16 to U18, with girls surpassing boys in 10 m sprint, CoD, YYIR1, and relative force improvements.
The greater difference with the older age groups in girls also explains the markedly greater sex difference observed in the U16 age group compared to the U14, whereas similar differences were observed between U16s and U18s (Table4).
These findings suggest that while girls may plateau in physical development during early puberty, they show potential for significant improvements later in adolescence as they adapt to new body proportions and are likely exposed to more targeted physical training.
During the PHV period, boys typically experience their most rapid development in physical performance (Philippaerts et al.2006) due to a surge in the production of testosterone, increases in muscle mass, and rapid height growth (R. M. Malina et al.2004).
On the other hand, girls experience a greater increase in fat mass during the PHV period (Rutters et al.2009) and consequently less improvements in physical performance: The U14 girls in our study were on average one year past their PHV, whereas boys on average were almost a year pre‐PHV in the U14 group.
Being closer to their peak developmental period and benefiting from more advantageous maturation are greatly contributing to the more pronounced difference in physical characteristics observed for boys between the U14 and U16 age group compared to girls (Ripka et al.2020; Rutters et al.2009).
Such a development plateau in girls around the age of 13–14—about one year after PHV—has been suggested previously (Armstrong and van Mechelen2017), and aligns with our data, which shows increased difference in physical characteristics between sexes from U14 to U16.
Additionally, differences in training volumes and content could influence the results.
Girls tend to be less involved in strength training from an early age than boys (Till et al.2014; R. M. Malina et al.2004; Weakley et al.2017), and this was also observed in our study, where boys in the U14 group averaged approximately one more hour of training per week than girls in the same age group.
Results from previous studies indicate increasing sex differences with age (Andrade et al.2021; Carvalho et al.2019; Toong et al.2018; Vargas et al.2020).
Notably, in our study, the U18 girls performed markedly better than the U16s, such as boys, deviating from the expected trend of performance plateau toward the end of maturation (Carvalho et al.2019; Greier et al.2019).
The results may reflect the influence of different strength and conditioning training regimes because a significantly greater strength training volume was observed among the U18 girls (2.2 weekly hours) than the U16s (1.0 weekly hours).
The increased focus on strength training in the girls U18 could explain the greater performance differences observed between the older age groups compared to previous studies.
A similar difference in training volume was observed for the boys.
Moreover, no difference in training volume, neither team nor strength training, was observed between sexes in the U18 group.
This suggests that improvements in physical performance, especially among older girls, could potentially align with those of boys, given similar training volumes.
However, these findings could also stem from the inherent limitations in cross‐sectional study designs, such as selective bias due to smaller, more physically advanced older groups (Panzeri et al.2008).
Moreover, this effect could be further exaggerated or nuanced by differing participation trends between sexes (Emmonds et al.2023), which may introduce additional variability in the performance outcomes observed.
An additional factor to consider is the impact of injuries on physical development.
Although there was no observed difference in the overall prevalence of health problems or injuries between the sexes, there was a significantly greater prevalence of overuse injuries in girls and acute injuries in boys (Appendix Table1).
These findings emphasize the need for more in‐depth longitudinal studies to better understand the dynamics between physical development, training load, injuries, and participation trends.
Age was a significant factor for all measures of absolute muscle strength for both sexes, aligning with previous research (Andrade et al.2021; Buchheit et al.2016; Duarte et al.2018; Markovic et al.2020; Nedeljkovic et al.2007; Niederer et al.2020; Roe et al.2018; Söderman et al.2000; Vargas et al.2020).
However, when normalized for body mass, no differences were found in eccentric hamstring strength, isometric hip adduction, or shoulder strength from U14 to U18.
This contrasts with the age difference observed in relative force and power from the leg press in the current study and relative squat strength in previous research (Till et al.2014; Keiner et al.2013,2014,2018; Kelly et al.2017; Till et al.2016).
Yet, relative strength measured in isometric mid‐thigh pull has shown minimal age group difference, indicating possible test‐specific discrepancies (Emmonds, Sawczuk, et al.,2020; Emmonds, Scantlebury, et al.,2020; Morris et al.2018).
Increases in eccentric strength, measured with the Nordic hamstring in younger football players, is heavily linked to body mass gains (Markovic et al.2020).
However, muscle mass increases differently in various body parts, particularly in the upper body in boys, and such unproportioned gains could reduce the relative strength in the lower extremities in exercises such as the Nordic hamstring (Roe et al.2018).
Additionally, a large proportion of the body mass increases in girls during puberty is from fat mass, which usually negatively impacts relative strength.
The lack of difference observed in relative hamstring, hip adduction, and shoulder strength might imply that growth and maturation do not affect all physical characteristics uniformly and that individualized approaches may be necessary to address the specific needs of developing young athletes.
It is also important for coaches to be aware of the lack of increase in relative values in girls, including relative force, as this is crucial for the appropriate management of girls' athletes during puberty.
Girls go through the growth spurt earlier than boys and should therefore probably also be exposed to appropriate strength training earlier to potentially boost their physical development and for injury prevention.
The subtle differences in strength across age groups, especially when normalized to body mass, indicate that more factors than growth are involved.
Allometric scaling has demonstrated varying results among different age groups, and research has shown that this method can remove the effect of body mass when comparing players, as strength normalized to body mass often underestimates performance in heavier individuals (Crewther et al.2009; Wisløff et al.1998).
On the other hand, our results showed a shift toward greater difference between age groups when applying allometric scaling to the results than normalized to body mass (Table3).
This finding supports previous research suggesting that various processes associated with maturation could confound the relationship between muscle strength and body size (Jaric2002).
Potential factors that can explain the differences are neural and metabolic factors, such as improved neural function, increased muscle stiffness, changes in muscle architecture, rise in circulating testosterone levels boosting muscle power and muscle mass in the upper body, and changes in body composition resulting in larger relative muscle mass (R. M. Malina et al.2004).
The comparison of sex differences across maturity groups mirrors the trends observed in the age group comparisons, with boys outperforming girls in most physical tests across all maturity stages from the time of PHV and later.
As no girls were categorized as pre‐PHV, it was not possible to compare the sexes at this stage.
These results could suggest that the physical differences between boys and girls are consistent across developmental stages and are not solely influenced by chronological age or maturation phase but are likely driven by biological sex differences in growth patterns, such as muscle and fat mass development.
Although prediction equations of age at PHV offer an efficient, noninvasive method for estimating the maturity status in adolescent athletes, it is essential to recognize their limitations.
These methods are particularly constrained for early or late‐maturing athletes, especially girls (Kozieł and Malina2018), it greatly overestimates early maturation in girls before PHV and late maturation after PHV age, and this should be carefully considered when interpreting results.
Age group comparisons offer valuable insights in age‐matched performance differences, an important aspect considering most youth teams today are organized by chronological age, making age group comparisons directly applicable to current team structures.
Nevertheless, since individual physical development during adolescence is heavily influenced by maturity, focusing solely on age‐group differences risks overlooking maturity's critical role in shaping performance variations during these years.
Athletes of the same chronological age can vary widely in biological maturity, which significantly impacts performance, strength, and injury risk (R. M. Malina et al.2004).
The present study observed significant intragroup variability across all groups.
Previous research suggests that early maturing athletes often outperform their late‐maturing peers in various physical metrics (Armstrong and Welsman2001; Valente‐dos‐Santos, Coelho‐e‐Silva, Martins, et al.,2012; Yang and Chen2022).
However, the variations depicted in Figure2of our data underpin that physical performance is not solely determined by the maturation status.
For instance, including participants from two different sports likely contribute to the variation.
This finding highlights the complexity involved in adolescent physical performance and development.
Although correlations between physical performance and maturity status are often observed in boys, this relationship is inconsistent and even less evident in girls.
Various factors likely influence this dynamic, contributing to variability in outcomes across individuals.
Therefore, evaluating the physical performance of adolescent athletes requires a nuanced multifaceted approach that considers the individual's unique developmental stage, training history, sport‐specific requirements, and potential injury risk factors.
It requires a combination of objective measurements, subjective assessments, and ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal health and performance outcomes.
Although efficient in assessing diverse populations at a single time point, the cross‐sectional design of this study presents inherent limitations.
The use of different testing equipment across various sites potentially introduced inconsistencies in the data, and the potential for selection bias and the variations in training across teams might mask actual differences and fail to reflect longitudinal trends or individual developmental nuances.
The study's scope could have been enhanced by comparing football and handball players; however, the limited sample size restricted this analysis.
The absence of significant differences in reported health problems might imply that injury rates did not affect the observed group performance disparities (Appendix Table1), but this questionnaire faced a low response rate (67 ± 5%).
Moreover, injury locations, which were not reported in this study, might also be important for the development of physical performance.
The difficulty in gathering high‐quality health and injury data complicates drawing definitive conclusions about the extent of injuries related to growth and development.
The low response rate in this study can likely be attributed to various factors, including the young age of the participants, the inclusion of several teams, and technical challenges with the phone application used for reporting.
Therefore, future studies should focus on finding better strategies for collecting health‐related data on adolescent athletes, as this is vital for understanding the relationship between longitudinal physical development and injury rates during this period.
Measures of muscle mass could have been included to provide a more accurate understanding of the physical performance differences between boys and girls, given its considerable influence on the development of several physical characteristics.
This would have allowed a more precise assessment of how changes in muscle mass contribute to physical performance across age, sex, and maturity groups.
For example, a recent systematic review (Tingelstad et al.2023) estimated that, at 15 years old, muscle mass comprises approximately 76% of total body mass in girls and 88% in boys.
Applying these approximations to the U16 sample in this study suggests that differences in relative power and force between boys and girls would be much smaller, with reduced effect size differences.
This highlights the potential for differences in muscle mass to account for much of the observed sex differences.
The impact of maturation on physical development is profound, and future studies should incorporate more robust methods for assessing maturity.
Noninvasive techniques, such as the Khamis–Roche method, which uses parental height or ideally measuring skeletal age with X‐ray, are recommended (Lloyd et al.2014).
Findings based solely on age group differences may fail to address the challenges of coaching or developing athletes with varying maturity levels within the same age group.
Despite these limitations, our research contributes significant strengths to the field.
It stands out as one of few studies to investigate both boys and girls, establishing a solid foundation for direct sex comparisons in physical performance at different ages.
This study offers comparative data on cross‐sectional age and sex differences in adolescent team sport athletes and reference data for the specific assessments employed.
Recognizing the differences across age groups and sexes in physical development and maturation timing, and the considerable intragroup variation, it is crucial to design training programs tailored to distinct phases during adolescence, and individual needs and maturation levels, accommodating their unique progress and response.
Consequently, caution should be implemented in selection processes, avoiding premature selection based on physical capabilities that may not fully reflect an athlete's long‐term athletic potential.
Educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the normal range of variations in adolescent development can help set realistic expectations and reduce undue pressure on young players.
Overall, this study could contribute to evidence‐based decision‐making and support the long‐term athletic development of young players.
Furthermore, it is imperative to practice patience and show understanding during these developmental years, particularly for girls, who generally experience a slower rate of development.
This considerable variation in development trajectories, both physically and in sports performance, necessitates a supportive environment that acknowledges and accommodates these natural progressions for all young athletes.
Furthermore, integrating injury prevention strategies, such as the FIFA 11+ program, as part of the normal training is crucial for all age groups during the adolescent period to mitigate the risk of both acute and overuse injuries (Sadigursky et al.2017; Soligard et al.2009).
Our study offers valuable insights into age and sex differences in the physical performance of adolescent team sport athletes.
We confirmed our hypothesis that boys would perform better than girls across all age groups and have larger between‐age differences.
However, larger differences between age groups were evident only between the U14 and U16 groups, with boys showing greater increases in performance compared to girls.
In contrast, the differences between the U16 and U18 groups were similar between sexes.
Although this may result from selection bias, it suggests a greater potential for improvements later in adolescence, following the initial plateau during early puberty, as girls adapt to new body proportions and are likely exposed to more targeted physical training.
The distinctions among age groups and sexes emphasize the importance of individualized training programs tailored to young athletes' specific needs and maturation levels alongside targeted injury prevention measures.
These findings improve our understanding of how age affects physical performance in adolescent team sport players and provide a valuable reference for coaches and strength and conditioning coaches in adolescent team sports.
