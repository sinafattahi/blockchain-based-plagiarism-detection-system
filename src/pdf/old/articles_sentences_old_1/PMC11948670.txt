The applications of artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine are considered to be among the most important technologies shaping the future of modern healthcare.
AI provides major innovations in both human and veterinary medicine, bringing radical changes in various areas, from disease diagnosis to treatment processes.
Particularly in animal health and treatment, the advantages offered by AI enable veterinarians to make faster, more precise, and more effective decisions.
This study aims to examine the future effects of artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine in light of scientific research and to reveal how these innovations are reflected in the scientific literature.
AI introduces significant innovations in both medical and veterinary practices, offering many advantages by transforming animal health and treatment processes.
Veterinarians can utilise AI across various fields to expedite diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, achieving more accurate results and optimising treatment plans.
By providing these services, AI makes a considerable contribution to both animal and human health as well as general veterinary practices (Hamet and Tremblay2017; Jiang et al.2017).
However, artificial intelligence technologies provide a significant transformation in a wide range of areas such as veterinary anatomy, education, diagnosis and surgical applications.
The potential and limitations of artificial intelligence on animal studies bring new opportunities, especially in the analysis of complex anatomical structures and other areas of veterinary medicine.
In addition, the use of artificial intelligence‐supported techniques in veterinary medical imaging provides significant contributions to improving clinical outcomes by increasing accuracy, speed, efficiency and data security in diagnostic and surgical processes (Choudhary et al.2023; Choudhary et al.2024; Vickram et al.2024; Yılmaz2024).
The AI process follows a pathway that begins with clinical data collection, progresses through data enrichment with Natural Language Processing (NLP), continues with data analysis using Machine Learning (ML), and culminates in the clinical decision‐making process.
This roadmap starts and ends with clinical processes.
Regardless of how advanced AI techniques may be, they should be inspired by clinical problems and ultimately employed to support clinical applications.
Notably, a significant portion of the AI literature focuses on diagnostic imaging, genetic tests, and electrodiagnostic data during the diagnosis stage (Figure1).
For instance, Jha and Topol (2016) encouraged radiologists to leverage AI technologies when analysing diagnostic images containing large amounts of data.
A comprehensive roadmap illustrating the journey from clinical data generation to data enrichment using natural language processing (NLP), advanced data analysis with machine learning (ML), and integration into clinical decision‐making processes.
AI‐supported image processing and analysis systems enable veterinarians to interpret medical images, such as X‐rays, ultrasounds, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), more quickly and accurately.
For instance, these technologies can facilitate the early diagnosis of conditions such as hip dysplasia in dogs or tumours in cats.
Consequently, AI‐supported technologies accelerate the diagnostic processes for veterinarians, allowing them to initiate treatment for animals more swiftly and accurately (Hennessey et al.2022).
Moreover, AI technologies analyse large datasets, consolidating critical information that aids in disease diagnosis, including anamnesis, symptoms, and laboratory results.
This capability facilitates the early diagnosis of complex diseases and enables a prompt start to the treatment process (AlZubi2023).
Additionally, these technologies can offer personalised treatment methods by enabling real‐time, individual monitoring of animal health, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of treatment plans (Albadrani et al.2024; Appleby and Basran2022).
Through AI analyses, the capacity for rapid big data analysis in the development of new veterinary drugs and the design of clinical trials has accelerated the discovery and testing of potential drug candidates.
This capability significantly shortens the time required for drugs to reach the market (Kumar et al.2023; Paul et al.2021).
Furthermore, various AI‐supported applications provide veterinarians with the opportunity to offer remote consultancy services, which can be crucial in emergencies or when access to veterinary services is challenging (Abu‐Seida et al.2024).
This bibliometric study aims to examine the extent to which artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine is represented in global research, the trends in this field, and the prominent topics.

Therefore, bibliometric analyses that evaluate research trends, collaborations, and publication dynamics related to AI in veterinary medicine are essential for understanding scientific advancements and guiding future research.
The primary objective of integrating AI into veterinary medicine is to enhance efficiency and, in some cases, improve the quality of care.
Research in human medicine has shown that AI and robotic systems can sometimes surpass human surgeons, indicating a similar potential in veterinary procedures.
AI has the potential to significantly improve the overall quality of veterinary services by automating various aspects of work management and medical care (INVMA2024).
In the AI process, several stages are involved, including enriching data with natural language processing (NLP), analysing it with machine learning (ML), and ultimately supporting clinical decision‐making from the clinical data collection phase.
Regardless of the sophistication of AI techniques, they should be developed based on clinical problems and directed towards practical clinical applications.
A significant portion of the AI literature focuses on the analysis of diagnostic imaging, genetic tests, and electrodiagnostic data, particularly during the diagnosis phase (Jiang et al. 2017).
Jha and Topol (2016) suggested that radiologists should utilise AI technologies when analysing extensive volumes of diagnostic images.
The IBM Watson system serves as a pioneer in this field, having made significant strides in oncology.
For instance, in a cancer study, 99% of Watson's treatment recommendations aligned with physician decisions, and Watson collaborated with Quest Diagnostics to offer Genetic Diagnostic Analysis (Lohr2016).
Tools like VOSviewer have been employed for detailed analyses of collaboration networks, research trends, and future research topics.

This underscores how AI can significantly accelerate solutions to complex biomedical challenges.
Although specific standards for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of AI systems are currently lacking in regulations, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has initiated guidance studies for assessing AI systems to address this issue (Graham2016).
Zawacki‐Richter et al. (2019) found that the articles examined in their study were published across 104 different journals, indicating the broad impact of AI applications across various disciplines.
The analysis results from this study indicated that the fields contributing most significantly in terms of article volume were ‘Veterinary Sciences (11.8%)’, ‘Computer Science (11.6%)’, ‘Science Technology Other Topics (8.1%)’, and ‘Engineering (7.5%)’.
The 11% publication rate in veterinary sciences indicates a need for further research in this area.
Countries such as the United States (51.4%), Taiwan (19.1%), the United Kingdom (13.1%), and Germany (10.3%) emerged as leading contributors to AI research.
Zawacki‐Richter and colleagues (2019) analysed the geographical distribution of articles in their study on artificial intelligence research across all scientific fields.
The analysis examined 19 countries.
The results show that 50% of the articles came from the United States, China, Taiwan, and Turkey alone.
This suggests that AI research is concentrated in these countries.
The prominence of institutions such as the US Department of Veterans Affairs (20.6%), Veterans Health Administration (19.3%), Pennsylvania State University (9.3%), Taipei Veterans General Hospital (11.6%), and Harvard University (11.5%) underscores the US's leadership in this research field.
Zawacki‐Richter et al. (2019) noted that most of the examined articles were published by US universities, indicating that academic institutions in the United States significantly drive research in AI.
This finding reinforces the US's position as a leader in AI research.
Recent years have seen significant momentum in integrating AI into veterinary medicine.

Furthermore, the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) has established a task force dedicated to technology and innovation (INVMA2024).
According to Web of Science indexes, 84.6% of articles are included in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐Expanded) category, followed by the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) (9.0%) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) (7.7%).
This distribution indicates that most research is published in high‐impact journals, underscoring the scientific validity of the field.
Given the increasing trend of AI studies in recent years, it is anticipated that such scientific processes will become increasingly significant in veterinary medicine moving forward.
Langlotz (2019) posited that radiologists employing AI would outpace those who do not.
While there may be no immediate concern regarding the replacement of veterinarians by AI, the potential benefits for both the profession and animal health cannot be overlooked.
Appleby and Basran (2022) noted that while there is much to understand about AI, it holds great promise for enhancing veterinary practices.
This research has its limitations.
Firstly, bibliometric analysis serves only to identify trends in the literature and does not provide a direct evaluation of data accuracy.
Hence, more comprehensive studies are necessary.
Conducting similar analyses using various databases could help identify knowledge gaps.
Bibliometric analysis aims to examine existing literature and provide a general overview, so the findings warrant deeper investigation through qualitative research.
Finally, considering the study's limitations, future research with larger datasets and diverse methodologies is expected to contribute to a more profound understanding of AI literature in veterinary medicine.
In conclusion, this bibliometric analysis delineates delineates global trends and significant studies in the realm of AI in veterinary medicine.
It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and industry representatives in the health sector, underscoring the importance of research in this area.
Future investigations into AI applications in veterinary medicine could aid in the development of clinical applications and enhance animal health.
Additionally, the findings highlight the necessity for further studies in the literature on AI in veterinary medicine.
Future research should delve into the effects of AI technologies on animal health and behaviour more comprehensively.
Such investigations could contribute to veterinary medicine's evolution and provide innovative solutions in practice.
Moreover, comparing AI applications across different countries could foster international collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Ultimately, a better understanding of AI's potential in veterinary medicine offers significant opportunities for improving animal health and welfare in the future.
