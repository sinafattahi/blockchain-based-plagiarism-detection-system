This case report describes a 10‐year‐old male with a history of kidney transplantation who developed trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS), a rare skin disorder associated with immunosuppression.
The patient's condition, characterized by follicular papules and keratinous spines primarily on the face, was managed by a multidisciplinary team.
Treatment involved reducing immunosuppression and administering topical cidofovir alongside oral leflunomide, leading to significant clinical improvement over several months.
This case adds to the literature of TS management and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care as well as the challenges of treatment accessibility due to insurance limitations.
Trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS) is a rare, folliculocentric dermatologic disorder first described in 1995 [1] and officially named TS by Haycox et al. [2] in a patient with renal and pancreatic transplants in 1999.
Ubiquitous to immune suppression, it is believed to be caused by the trichodysplasia spinulosa‐associated polyomavirus (TSPyV), an alpha polyomavirus that shows high seroprevalence among healthy adults but is generally non‐pathogenic [3].
The exact trigger for TS in some immunocompromised patients remains unclear, and whether it results from a new infection or viral reactivation is an ongoing debate [4,5].
TS typically presents as painless erythematous papules with protruding keratinous spines, most commonly on the central face.
However, it can rarely involve other body areas, such as the ears and trunk.
TS may also be associated with alopecia of the eyebrows and dermal hyperplasia of the affected areas [6,7].
Although cutaneous disease is the primary clinical manifestation of infection, TSPyV has been identified in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, tonsils, and respiratory specimens using nucleic acid detection, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy [8,9,10,11,12].
High‐level viremia can exist months before typical trichodysplasia spinulosa skin lesions [13].
Histopathology often reveals dilated hair follicles with keratin plugging and eosinophilic trichohyalin protein deposits [14].
Due to its rarity, there is limited literature on TS, and no gold standard treatment has been established.
We report the case of a 10‐year‐old male with a history of living‐related kidney transplantation at the age of 21 months for end stage renal disease secondary to obstructive uropathy who presented to the dermatology clinic with a concern about facial bumps.
The patient and his family described a waxing and waning rash that persisted for 1–2 months without complete resolution.
Clinical examination revealed numerous coalescing, skin‐colored to pink follicular papules with keratinous spines on the central face (Figure1).
No other body areas were affected, and there was no associated alopecia.
The patient was also noted to have widespread molluscum contagiosum infection.
The patient's immunosuppressive regimen at the time included oral tacrolimus 2 mg BID (with dose range of 5–9 ng/mL), prednisone 5 mg daily, mycophenolic acid (260 mg qAM, 180 mg qPM), and monthly tocilizumab infusions.
Trichodysplasia spinulosa was suspected and a skin biopsy was recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
In the interim 8 weeks, his eruption had worsened, with lesions becoming more confluent and spreading to the entire face, ears, and postauricular scalp, causing him significant social distress.
A punch biopsy of the right lateral nose revealed histological features pathognomonic of TS, including distorted hair follicles, absence of follicular papilla, and nucleolated eosinophilic cells with prominent trichohyalin granules (Figure2A,B).
Polyomavirus immunostaining was strongly positive.
PCR testing was not performed.
Blood cell‐free DNA testing was performed and revealed Trichodysplasia spinulosa‐associated polyomavirus copies of 105 molecules/mL.
Numerous coalescing pinpoint skin‐colored to pink follicular papules with keratinous spines on the central face.
Distorted hair follicles affected by trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV) lack follicular papilla (A), original magnification100×, and demonstrate columns of nucleolated, eosinophilic cells with prominent trichohyalin granules, pathognomonic of trichodysplasia spinulosa (B), 400× original magnification.
A multidisciplinary team, including pediatric nephrology, infectious disease, and dermatology, recommended reducing the patient's immunosuppressive therapy.
In addition to TS, the patient was diagnosed with BK viremia.
Mycophenolic acid was discontinued, and the tacrolimus dose was reduced.
He was started on topical cidofovir 3% cream to be applied nightly, along with oral leflunomide, a treatment previously reported effective in isolated cases [9].
His immune workup revealed the following results, all within normal for his age: CD4 381 cells/mcl, CD8 362 cells/MCL, CD19 109 cells/MCL, and NK 138 cells/mcl.
After 4 weeks on this regimen, the patient's TS showed marked improvement.
Although topical cidofovir initially caused mild irritation, he eventually tolerated it well.
By 10 weeks, the number of lesions had significantly decreased on the forehead, cheeks, and ears, though nasal lesions remained prominent.
At 14 weeks, further improvement was observed in most areas, but dermal hyperplasia developed on the lateral nasal surface (Figure3).
The patient continued to improve, and by 9 months, the TS had completely resolved (Figure4).
Topical cidofovir was discontinued after 11 months.
His molluscum contagiosum also resolved during this period.
Leflunomide was continued for 1 year to manage concurrent BK viremia, after which his immunosuppression regimen was transitioned to tacrolimus and everolimus.
It has been over 12 months since the patient stopped treatment, with no recurrence of TS.
His transplant nephrology team continues to manage his immunosuppression to ensure optimal transplant outcomes.
Trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS) is a rare folliculocentric skin disorder primarily affecting immune‐compromised individuals, including solid organ transplant recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies, with no age or sex predilection [15,16,17,18].
Initially thought to be an adverse effect of cyclosporine, TS was identified in 2010 as caused by trichodysplasia spinulosa‐associated polyomavirus (TSPyV) [3].
It is a ubiquitous virus and seroprevalence increases with age, estimated at 10% in children aged 1–2 years, 41% in those under 10, and 75% by age 30, stabilizing thereafter.
The overall seroprevalence is 70% in immunocompetent individuals and 89% in immune‐compromised populations [19].
Proposed mechanisms of TS in immunosuppressed hosts include primary TSPyV infection, re‐exposure, or reactivation of latent virus, similar to JC and BK polyomaviruses [13].
The discrepancy between TSPyV's high seroprevalence and the low number of reported TS cases suggests other contributing factors yet to be identified.
TS typically presents as centrofacial indurated papules with protuberant follicular spines and, in some cases, associated alopecia.
The trunk and scalp may also be involved.
Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion, characteristic histopathology, electron microscopy, and molecular confirmation via immunostaining or PCR [5,6,7,9].
TS was diagnosed through histopathology and positive immune staining in our case.
TSPyV has been detected in affected patients' skin, urine, blood, respiratory secretions, and cerebrospinal fluid [10,11,12].
Although our patient had a detectable viral load in the blood via cell‐free DNA testing, no other organ involvement was identified.
Literature on using this diagnostic modality for TS is scarce, possibly due to its emerging role.
There are no standardized treatment guidelines for TS.
Reducing immunosuppression is typically the first step in managing infections in immunocompromised patients; however, this may not always be feasible due to concerns about allograft status and overall prognosis [5,14].
Reported treatments include topical agents such as cidofovir, retinoids, imiquimod, corticosteroids, and keratolytics, as well as oral therapies like valganciclovir, isotretinoin, and leflunomide.
Treatment outcomes vary widely, ranging from no improvement to complete resolution [7,20].
Topical cidofovir (3%) is often recommended as a first‐line therapy based on case reports demonstrating its efficacy.
As a cytosine analog, cidofovir inhibits polyomavirus replication, leading to clinical improvement in many patients.
However, its high cost and potential for systemic absorption limit its widespread use [21].
Oral valganciclovir, a guanosine analog inhibiting polymerase activity, has been associated with significant improvement and even complete resolution in some cases.
However, there is limited in vivo or in vitro evidence supporting its activity against human polyomaviruses, and its use is complicated by the risk of bone marrow suppression [22,23].
Leflunomide, commonly used for rheumatologic conditions, exhibits antiviral activity against DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and BK polyomavirus (BKPyV).
It has been reported as a successful treatment for generalized TS in adults.
Common side effects include diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, and hematologic toxicity [24].
Other therapies, such as topical and oral retinoids, corticosteroids, topical imiquimod, and keratolytics, have shown inconsistent or limited efficacy [1].
At our institution, oral leflunomide is routinely used for managing BK viremia.
Given the patient's concurrent diagnosis of BK viremia and TS, we initiated a treatment regimen combining oral leflunomide, topical cidofovir, and a reduction in immunosuppression.
While leflunomide was covered by insurance, the high cost of cidofovir ($429 for 15 g) presented a significant financial barrier.
Despite these challenges, the patient achieved notable clinical improvement, with no recurrence of TS to date.
This case underscores the efficacy of leflunomide and topical cidofovir, combined with immunosuppression reduction, in treating TS and highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in its management.
As the population of transplant recipients and immunocompromised patients—including those in oncology, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and cellular therapy—continues to grow, awareness of rare skin conditions like TS is essential for timely diagnosis and intervention.
However, management remains challenging due to the limited availability of effective therapies, insurance‐related barriers, and the necessity of coordinated care across multiple specialties.
