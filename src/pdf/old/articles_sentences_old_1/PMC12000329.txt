This prospective cohort study explored the association between two upstream IFN-γ variants (rs2069709: G > T and rs2069705: A > G) and hazard factors for malaria outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of children (n= 941, 3–36 mos.
), followed for three years.
The impact of age, sex, previous malaria exposure, HIV1 infection, and sickle-cell genotypes (HbAA, HbAS, and HbSS) was also investigated.
Reduced malaria episodes were associated with older age at enrollment [HR = 0.957 (95% CI = 0.953–0.961) per month,P< 2.2e-16], HIV1 infection [0.687 (0.545–0.866),P= 0.001], being female [0.910 (0.859–0.964),P= 0.040], and HbAS [0.823 (0.754–0.898),P= 0.005].
The GA/TA diplotype [0.376 (0.230–0.614),P= 0.002] also reduced the hazard of malaria, while TA haplotype increased susceptibility [1.749 (1.159–2.640),P= 0.029].
Factors protecting against the development of SMA [Hemoglobin (Hb < 6.0 g/dL)] included older age [0.927 (0.913–0.942) per month,P< 2.2e-16], previous malaria episodes [0.576 (0.542–0.614,P= 9.5e-32)], HbAS [0.553 (0.400-0.766),P= 0.015].
The rs2069705AG genotype increased the hazard of SMA [1.697 (1.002–2.875),P= 0.042].
Reduced hazard of mortality was observed for older children [0.898 (0.857–0.941),P< 2.2e-16], while a higher hazard was present in HIV-infected children [12.475 (6.380-24.392),P< 2.2e-16], and in those with HbSS [6.341 (1.944–20.686),P= 0.007].
The GG haplotype increased the mortality hazard [1.817 (0.936–3.527),P= 0.078].
The results here highlight critical factors influencing the hazard of malaria, SMA, and mortality.
Despite effective control efforts in recent decades, malaria continues to be a significant threat to public health, with an estimated 249 million cases in 2023, resulting in 608,000 deaths worldwide1.
Approximately 233 million of these cases and 580,000 deaths were reported in the WHO African region, accounting for ~ 94% and 95% of global cases and deaths, respectively.Plasmodium falciparumis the most common species in this region, responsible for over 80% of deaths among immune-naive children under five years old1.
Studies show that malaria is a primary reason for in-patient admissions in western Kenya, a holoendemicP.
falciparumtransmission region, accounting for 63.4% of admissions and 61 deaths for every 1,000 malaria admissions among children under five years old2.
The primary manifestation of severe malaria in these children residing in western Kenya is severe malarial anemia [SMA, hemoglobin (Hb) levels < 6.0 g/dL], which is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality3.
The pathogenesis of SMA is multifactorial and includes suppressed erythropoietic responses in the bone marrow, increased clearance of both parasitized and non-parasitized erythrocytes by the spleen and phagocytic cells, and intravascular lysis (hemolysis)4–7.
Over the past two decades, our investigations in western Kenya have shown that genetic variation in immune response genes plays a crucial role in shaping susceptibility to malaria episodes, SMA development, and all-cause mortality8–12.
Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a key cytokine primarily produced by NK cells, Th1 cells, and CD8 + T cells that contribute to innate and adaptive immunity13.
IFN-γ plays a pivotal role in activating macrophages to boost the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and eliminate intracellular pathogens14.
It also drives the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into Th1 cells, critical for combating intracellular infections while suppressing Th2 cell differentiation15.
Additionally, IFN-γ improves immune response by enhancing antigen presentation through upregulating MHC molecule expression on antigen-presenting cells16–20, and decreases the rates of asexual malaria parasite replication in malaria patients.
However, excessive IFN-γ production evokes autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions due to sustained tissue damage21.
A meta-analysis showed that patients with severe malaria have higher mean IFN-γ levels compared to those with uncomplicated malaria22.
We previously demonstrated that children with SMA had elevated circulating levels of IFN-γ relative to those with non-SMA23.
Collectively, high IFN-γ levels were shown to limit parasitemia but exacerbate malaria disease severity.
Functional point mutations [i.e., single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] in the upstream region of the IFN-γ gene (i.e., rs2069709G > T and rs2069705A > G) have been linked to severe malaria, specifically cerebral malaria (CM).
Malian children who were carriers of the rs2069709T allele had a lower risk of CM and higher circulating IFN-γ levels24.
In contrast, the rs2069705C allele has been associated with an increased risk of CM in Gambian children in West Africa25.
Variability in carriers of the rs2069705 SNP is also associated with susceptibility to various infectious and inflammatory diseases.
For instance, the rs2069705GG genotype is associated with a ~ 50% increased risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in West African populations and a ~ 53% reduced risk of asthma in Asian (Indian) populations26,27.
Since the impact of the two SNPs on malarial disease susceptibility has not been reported for holoendemicP.
falciparumtransmission regions, the current investigations focused on the influence of rs2069709G > T and rs2069705A > G variants on susceptibility to the longitudinal hazard of malaria infections, SMA, and all-cause mortality in a population of Kenya children (n= 941, aged 3–36 months upon enrollment) followed for 36 months.
Moreover, the evaluation of the longitudinal hazard included additional variables that can strongly impact malaria disease outcomes, such as age, previous exposure to malaria, HIV1 infection, and sickle cell genotypes (HbAA, HbAS, and HbSS)28–33.
The demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics at enrollment are summarized in Table1.
A total of 941 children participated in the study.
Malaria status was categorized as aparasitemic (n= 211; free from malaria with any hemoglobin level), non-SMA (n= 487, Hb ≥ 6.0 g/dL), and SMA (n= 243, Hb < 6.0 g/dL).
The definitions of malarial anemia were based on 19,231 Hb measurements over 36 months in the current study area3.
The proportion of females and males was similar across the groups (P= 0.976).
Age differed across the groups (P= 2.854e-14), with children presenting with SMA being the youngest.
Axillary temperature also differed across the groups (P= 3.331e-8) and was lowest in aparasitemic children.
Assessment of hematological profiles on admission showed that white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width differed across the groups (P< 0.001 for all) and were highest in SMA, while platelets were lowest in this group.
Parasite densities were lower in children with SMA than non-SMA (P= 0.006).
Evaluation of additional endemic infectious diseases upon enrolment revealed that HIV1 infection and bacteremia were not evenly distributed (P= 0.005 andP= 0.029, respectively) and were highest in the SMA group.
The proportion of sickle cell genotypes differed across the group (P= 0.002) with HbAS enriched in the aparasitemic and non-SMA groups.
Collectively, children with SMA exhibit distinct clinical and hematological profiles compared to the other groups, highlighted by younger age at enrollment, more frequent co-infections, and reduced inheritance of HbAS.

Although the rs2069705 upstream variants are reported to be functional (i.e., alter IFN-γ production)34, in-silico analysis was performed for both the rs2069709 and rs2069705 loci to determine if the nucleotide transitions could alter Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS), an important consideration for mapping complex disease traits35.
For rs2069709, the G to T transversion mutation eliminates all TFBS specific to the wildtype G allele (such as TCF-3, TCF-1, LEF-1, and others) and introduces new binding sites for EcR, YY1, and AP-1.
Similarly, the A to G transversion mutation at rs2069705 results in the loss of TFBS specific to the wildtype A allele (including GR, GATA-1, and others) and the addition of new sites for delta factor and YY1.
Thus, previous studies and the in-silico results support the notion that the selected variants can impart functional changes to gene expression and protein products.
The two SNPs selected for investigation on chromosome 12q15 are located at chr:12:68161231 (rs2069709G > T) and chr:12:68159923 (rs2069705A > G) on build GRCh38.p14 (Fig.1A)36.
The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) for the SNPs were derived from the International HapMap Project, 1,000 Genomes Project, and genotyping of the current Kenyan cohort (Fig.1B)36,37.
Compared to the global population MAF of 0.01 for rs2069709, the minor allele is slightly enriched in the AFR (0.02), LWK (0.2), and Kenyan (Luo) cohort (0.03).
The global MAF for rs2069705 was 0.48 and comparable in the AFR (0.47) and Kenyan (Luo) cohort (0.49) populations and lowest in LWK (0.38).
In line with linkage analysis results from the AFR population, which informed the selection of the two variants, rs2069709G > T and rs2069705A > G are in linkage equilibrium (i.e., not linked) also in the current cohort no significant departure from linkage equilibrium was detectable (D’ = 0.109, LOD = 0.06, R² = 0.0).
These findings indicate that the selected IFN-γ variants exhibit distinct MAFs in the Kenyan cohort compared to the global population, with their lack of linkage in the cohort highlighting genetic diversity.

The frequency distributions of genotypes, haplotypes (binary), and diplotypes in the overall population and in the three study groups upon admission are presented in Table2.
The genotype distribution for rs2069709G > T was highly unbalanced (GG 93.8%, GT 6.0%, TT 0.2%) with a MAF of 3%.
These distributions were similar across the groups (P= 0.448) and conformed to Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium [HWE (P= 0.270)] in the overall population and the three clinical groups.
In contrast, the genotypic distribution at rs2069705A > G was more balanced (AA 26.6%, AG 48.9%, GG 24.5%) with a MAF of 49%.
The genotypic distributions differed across the three groups (P= 0.021) but not after adjusting for multiple testing (Bonferroni-Holm correction).
The overall population was consistent with HWE (P= 0.501), except in aparasitemic children (P= 0.033, insignificant after multiple test adjustments).
Although the distribution of haplotypes (GA, GG, TA, and TG) was comparable across the groups (P= 0.212), diplotypes (GA/GA, GA/GG, GA/TA, GG/GG, GG/TA, GG/TG, and TA/TG) differed across the study groups (P= 0.009).
Taken together, the frequency distribution data indicates that while the genotype distributions for rs2069709G > T and rs2069705A > G generally conform to HWE across the study groups, any observed deviations or differences were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing, suggesting that these SNPs exhibit stable genetic patterns in the studied population.

To identify factors influencing the long-term hazard of malaria, an Andersen-Gill Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the impact of the genetic variants and covariates on the time-to-event.
The effect of the variables retained in the model on the hazard of malaria (4,663 events) across 36 months is shown in Table3.
The hazard of malaria across the follow-up was reduced for children who were older at enrollment [age first/enrollment, HR = 0.957 (95% CI = 0.953–0.961) per month,P< 2.2e-16].
Children with HIV1 infection [0.687 (0.545–0.866),P= 0.010] and females [0.910 (0.859–0.964),P= 0.040] also had a reduced hazard of malaria, as did carriers of the HbAS genotype [0.823 (0.754–0.898),P= 0.005].
Inheritance of TA haplotype increased susceptibility to malaria [0.749 (1.159–2.640),P= 0.029], while the GA/TA diplotype [0.376 (0.230–0.614),P= 0.002] was associated with a reduced hazard.
There was also a 37.2% hazard of longitudinal malaria episodes in carriers of the GG/TA diplotype, but the results did not reach statistical significance [0.628 (0.403–0.979),P= 0.091].
This analysis highlights the importance of demographic variables, sickle cell trait carriage, and inheritance combinations for the two promoter variants on susceptibility to malaria across 36 months.

An Andersen-Gill Cox proportional hazard model was also used to determine the influence of genetic variants and covariates on the time-to-event for SMA episodes.
This model included the same covariates as in the malaria model, along with the addition of two variables to account for the influence of prior malaria episodes on the longitudinal development of SMA: no prior malaria and a count variable for the number of previous malaria episodes [prior malaria (count)].
Variables (446 events) that remained in the selection model are presented in Table4.
As with malaria, being at an older age at enrollment was protective against the development of SMA [0.927 (0.913–0.942)P< 2.2e-16].
Additional protection against SMA was offered by (i) being in cohort 2 [0.714 (0.546–0.935),P= 0.012], which summarizes underlying differences in the two cohorts being followed in different time ranges, (ii) higher numbers of previous malaria episodes [0.576 (0.542–0.614),P< 2.2e-16], reflecting host acquired immunity, and (iii) having no prior malaria episodes [0.356 (0.275–0.461),< 2.2e-16], reflecting protection for severe infections perhaps due to younger age and the presence of maternal antibodies.
Note that the two latter factors must be interpreted jointly.
Carriage of HbAS was also protective against the development of SMA [0.553 (0.400-0.766),P= 0.004].
However, there was an increased hazard of developing SMA in heterogeneous carriers of the rs2069705AG genotype [1.697 (1.002–2.875),P= 0.042].
Although carriers of the GA/GG diplotype had a 33.5% reduced hazard of SMA events, this impact did not reach statistical significance [0.665 (0.392–1.128),P= 0.117].
These results underscore the impact of age, history of previous malaria, inheritance of HbAS, and carriage of promoter variants, particularly the AG genotype at rs2069705, on the hazard of developing SMA during naturally acquired malarial immunity.
Impact of IFN-γ variants on the longitudinal risk of SMA.
Independent increments according to Anderson–Gill method for ordered multiple-outcome-per-subject.
The Cox proportional hazard model was fit to investigate the time-to-event, considering covariates, for SMA episodes.
Data are ranked per variable as follows: metric variables (age at 1st hospital visit/enrollment, Age first/enrollment), followed by categorical variables (HIV1, cohort, sex), sickle cell genotypes (HbSS, HbAS, while HbAA was used as reference), no prior malaria episodes, prior malaria (count, # of previous episodes), and IFN-γ genetic variants.

Results emerging from the Cox proportional hazard model investigating the impact of demographic and promoter variants on all-cause mortality are shown in Table5.
Children enrolled at older ages showed a 10.2% reduction in hazard of mortality per month [0.898 (0.857–0.941),P< 2.2e-16].
Conversely, those infected with HIV1 experienced a 12.5-fold increase in the hazard of all-cause mortality [12.475 (6.380-24.392),P< 2.2e-16], and children with sickle cell anemia (SCA, HbSS) had a 6.3-fold increased hazard of death during the study period [6.341 (1.944–20.686),P= 0.002].
Carriage of sickle cell trait (HbAS) imparted a 66.3% reduced hazard of all-cause mortality, but the effect size did not reach statistical significance [0.337 (0.105–1.084),P= 0.068].
The only promoter variant that emerged from the all-cause mortality modeling was the GG haplotype.
Although the GG haplotypic carriage increased the mortality hazard by 81.68%, the results were not statistically significant [1.817 (0.936–3.527),P= 0.078].
Thus, while age at first encounter, HIV1 infection, and SCA strongly influence all-cause mortality, the effect of the promoter variants has a moderate impact.
Cox proportional hazard modeling was implemented to investigate the impact of the variables on all-cause mortality.
Data are ranked per variable as follows: metric variables (age at 1st hospital visit/enrollment = Age first/enrollment), categorical variables (HIV1, cohort, sex), sickle cell genotypes (HbSS,HbAS, whileHbAAwas used as reference), andIFN-γgenetic variants.

SMA is a critical complication of malaria in children, marked by a significant reduction in Hb levels that can result in severe morbidity and increased mortality.
The impact of SMA is particularly profound in holoendemic regions, contributing to substantial childhood mortality and posing a significant public health challenge.
Understanding the factors that drive SMA is essential for developing effective strategies to reduce its incidence and improve outcomes in affected populations.
Our recent work demonstrates that the pathogenesis of SMA is multifactorial and influenced by different genes and gene networks3.
Investigations here focused on IFN-γ, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that triggers crucial immune responses during the early stages of malaria infection in both the pre-erythrocytic (hepatic) and erythrocytic phases38,39.
To gain insight into the role of IFN-γ on longitudinal disease outcomes, we selected two functional upstream variants (rs2069709: G > T and rs2069705: A > G) and showed that transitions in each of the SNPs have the potential to impart changes in transcription binding sites.
The two SNPs selected for investigation displayed distinct MAFs in the Kenyan cohort compared to the global population.
Moreover, despite their relatively close proximity on a genomic scale (~ 1,308 bps), and low measures of linkage disequilibrium (D’ = 0.109, LOD = 0.06, R² = 0.0), due to the low frequencies of the rs2069709G > T mutation, there was no significant departure from linkage equilibrium, suggesting that they are not co-inherited.
In addition to the two functional upstream variants of IFN-γ, we considered the impact of other variables known to impart strong effects on the longitudinal hazard of malaria and SMA, including age and sickle cell genotypes28,29,32,33.
We also investigated the impact of HIV1 on malaria and SMA episodes since our findings in a cross-sectional study showed that children infected with HIV1 have a significantly higher prevalence of SMA (8.71-fold) during acute P.falciparum infection, independent of parasite density31.
Additional variables considered in assessing the longitudinal hazard of SMA included whether the children had prior episodes of malaria and, if so, whether there was a relationship between the number of episodes and the development of SMA across 36 months.
By considering these factors in our modeling efforts, we aimed to capture a comprehensive understanding of the genetic and environmental influences on malaria and SMA during the follow-up through a robust multifactorial approach to predicting disease outcomes.
Our analysis identified several significant factors influencing long-term malaria hazard.
Older age at enrollment was strongly protective against malaria, highlighting reduced susceptibility to malaria as young children undergo repeated episodes and develop malarial immunity as they age.
Being female was also associated with a reduced hazard of malaria, potentially due to unknown genetic/epigenetic factors and sociocultural behavioral aspects.
The HbAS genotype provided significant protection against malaria, consistent with the known protective effect of the sickle cell trait33.
Interestingly, being infected with HIV1 was associated with a decreased hazard of malaria across 36 months, potentially due to enhanced type I immunity, longitudinal treatment with cotrimoxazole, or a combination of both40,41.
Moreover, HIV-1 infection leads to chronic immune activation, which may enhance the activity of innate immune cells such as macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells, and could contribute to an increased ability to clear parasitized erythrocytes42.
Another possible explanation is that HIV infection may alter cytokine profiles in a way that is less favorable for P.falciparumsurvival.
For example, elevated levels of cytokines such as IFN-γ may interfere with parasite replication during the liver or blood stages of the malaria life cycle43.
Additionally, the TA haplotype increased malaria susceptibility by 74.9%, whereas the GA/TA diplotype reduced the hazard by 62.3%.
This suggests that the combination of these alleles counteracts the increased hazard conferred by the carriage of the TA haplotype alone.
Although the GG haplotype showed a similar protective pattern when combined with the TA haplotype in the GA/TA diplotype, resulting in a 37.2% reduction in the hazard of malaria, the lack of statistical significance suggests that the protective effect of the GG/TA diplotype is not strong enough to confidently conclude that this combination provides meaningful protection against malaria.
These findings highlight the importance of demographic and genetic factors in modulating malaria susceptibility over time.
Findings from the Andersen-Gill Cox proportional hazard model offer valuable insights into the factors influencing the hazard of developing SMA in the context of naturally acquired malarial immunity.
The protective effect of older age at enrollment (7.2% per month) is consistent with children developing acquired immunity as they age and experience repeated infections, particularly in holoendemic regions where malaria begins early in life44.
This premise is supported by the protective effect of prior malaria episodes (42.4% decrease).
Interestingly, having no prior malaria episodes was associated with a 64.4% reduction in the hazard of SMA.
While this may seem counterintuitive at first, it likely reflects the prospective cohort design, where children were recruited at the hospital and followed for 36 months.
The children were enrolled at ages ranging from 3 to 36 months, and notably, 54.5% of the total SMA events occurred at enrollment.
Since SMA was already present in many children at the first visit, and subsequent SMA episodes were rare in the cohort, the analysis is biased towards those with no prior malaria.
This suggests that the protective effect from no previous malaria is partly due to the timing of recruitment and the high incidence of SMA at baseline rather than a direct protective mechanism.
The protective effect associated with cohort 2 (28.6%) may reflect the strengthening of the health system, with better healthcare access resulting from improved community awareness and enhanced management of malaria cases45.
This improved access and timely treatment likely contributed to reducing the development of SMA, highlighting the importance of early intervention in preventing severe outcomes.
The protective role of the HbAS genotype is consistent with the well-documented advantage of the sickle cell trait in malaria-endemic regions46.
HbAS carriers are less likely to experience severe complications from malaria, which is reflected in the reduced hazard of SMA observed in the study.
Inheritance of the rs2069705 AG genotype increased the hazard of developing SMA by 69.7%.
This result supports previous findings in West Africa in which the rs2069705 minor allele enhanced the hazard of CM by 1.4-fold (36%) and severe malaria by 5.5-fold in Gambian children and Saudi pregnant women, respectively25,34, suggesting the minor allele at this locus may contribute to a heightened susceptibility to severe forms of malaria across different populations.
While the GA/GG diplotype showed a trend toward fewer SMA events (33.5%), the lack of statistical significance indicates that this diplotype may not have a strong protective effect.
Overall, these findings emphasize the multifactorial nature for the development of SMA, where age, prior malaria history, genetic background, and specific promoter variants all play important roles.
Several variables strongly impacted childhood survival over the 36-month follow-up, including age, HIV1, and sickle cell genotypes, with less impact observed for the upstream variants.
Older age at enrollment was associated with a 10.2% reduction in mortality hazard per month, suggesting that as children age, their likelihood of survival increases, possibly due to the development of stronger immunity or other age-related protective factors.
This premise is supported by the protective effect observed against malaria and the development of SMA, leading causes of mortality in the region.
Conversely, HIV1 infection had a profound impact, with infected children facing a 12.5-fold higher hazard of death, pointing out the critical need for effective HIV management in this population.
Fortunately, the management of pediatric HIV has improved since the time of this cohort study, so it is likely that the impact of HIV on all-cause mortality may not be as significant currently.
Additionally, children with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) experienced a 6.3-fold increased hazard of mortality, consistent with the high mortality hazard associated with SCA, particularly in regions with limited access to comprehensive care47.
Although carriage of sickle cell trait (HbAS) was associated with a 66.3% reduction in all-cause mortality, this effect did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that while HbAS may offer some protective benefit, evidence in this study was not strong enough to confirm this definitively.
The GG haplotype was the only promoter variant that emerged from the model, showing an 81.68% increase in hazard of mortality; however, this result was also not statistically significant, indicating that the GG haplotype’s impact on mortality may be moderate or inconsistent.
Overall, the analysis highlights the strong influence of age, HIV1 infection, and SCA on all-cause mortality, while the effects of promoter variants appear less pronounced and secondary to these dominant demographic and health factors.
The robust data presented in this manuscript identify factors involved in the pathogenesis of SMA.
However, some limitations should be considered when interpreting these results.
For example, the findings are for a pediatric cohort from a holoendemic P.falciparum transmission region in western Kenya, primarily among the Luo ethnic group, limiting generalizability to other populations with different genetic backgrounds and environmental exposures (e.g., malaria transmission).
Despite adjusting for covariates such as age, sex, HIV-1 status, and sickle-cell genotypes, unmeasured confounders such as healthcare access should always be considered.
Additionally, the study utilizes statistical relationships but does not include functional validation to confirm if the genetic variants alter IFN-γ expression and subsequent immune responses.
In summary, the study highlights critical factors influencing the hazard of malaria, SMA, and mortality in children residing in malaria-holoendemic regions.
Key protective factors include older age, prior malaria episodes, sickle cell trait (HbAS) carriage, and inheritance of IFN-upstream variant combinations.
These findings highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to decipher the complex interplay of demographic and genetic variables that influence childhood morbidity and mortality.
Future directions should focus on enhancing genetic research, strengthening healthcare management for high-hazard groups, and implementing targeted public health strategies to reduce the burden of malaria and SMA in endemic regions.
Children withP.falciparummalaria (n= 941, ages 3–36 months) were enrolled (2004–2013) in the prospective cohorts at Siaya County Referral Hospital (SCRH), a rural government health facility in western Kenya’s holoendemicP.falciparumtransmission area.
After enrollment, children were followed for 36 months to observe outcomes of interest (i.e., longitudinal malaria and SMA episodes and mortality, see below).
The participants were from the Luo ethnic group.
Detailed descriptions of the study site and clinical manifestations of pediatric malaria can be found in our previous report48.
Children who had been hospitalized for any reason or had used anti-malarial drugs within two weeks before enrollment were excluded.
None of the participants had cerebral malaria.
At enrollment, participants were categorized into three clinical groups: aparasitemic controls that were febrile and presented at hospital for evaluation and found to be negative for falciparum malaria (n= 211), malaria without severe anemia (non-SMA) with Hb ≥ 6.0 g/dL and any density parasitemia (n= 487), and severe malarial anemia (SMA) with Hb < 6.0 g/dL and any density parasitemia (n= 243), as described in our previous report3.
Since our previous studies have shown that HIV1 and bacteremia31,49,50exacerbate anemia in children with malaria; all participants were tested for these co-pathogens.
Parents or guardians of all participants received pre- and post-HIV test counseling.
Sick children were treated according to Kenya’s Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines.
Informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians in their preferred language (i.e., English, Kiswahili, or Dholuo).
The Maseno University Scientific and Ethics Review Committee, Kenya (MUSERC; MSU/DRPI/MUERC/00510/18) and the University of New Mexico Institutional Review Board granted ethical approval (16–284).
All the experiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study participants were followed for 36 months after enrollment.
Parents/guardians were asked to bring their children to the hospital for quarterly visits.
If they could not attend a scheduled visit, our field personnel visited the child’s home to collect data on health status data, including mortality information.
Parents or guardians were also advised to bring their child to the hospital for febrile episodes or other illnesses (acute visits).
Participants underwent comprehensive physical and laboratory examinations during each acute and quarterly visit to ensure proper clinical management.
The following assessments were conducted: complete blood count, malaria parasitemia determination, and evaluation for viral and bacterial infections.
Throughout the follow-up period, mortality data were obtained from hospital records or verbal autopsies if the death occurred outside the hospital.
Venous blood samples (less than 3.0 mL) were collected into EDTA-containing Vacutainer®tubes before any treatment interventions.
Asexual malaria parasites (trophozoites) were counted against 300 leukocytes in peripheral blood smears stained with 10% Giemsa stain for 15 min.
To ensure quality control, two microscopists independently counted the parasites against 300 leukocytes, and the average of their counts was used as the final parasite count.
Parasite densities were calculated using the formula: [parasite density/µL = (WBC count/µL) × (trophozoites number of parasites/300 WBC]).
Complete hematological profiles were obtained using a Beckman Coulter®AcT diff2™ (Beckman–Coulter Corporation, Miami, FL, USA).
Sickle cell genotypes (HbAA, HbAS, and HbSS) were identified by Hb electrophoresis as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX, USA).
The presence of bacteremia was determined following the microbial culture methods described detailed in our previous publication50.
HIV1 infection was detected through serological and PCR testing according to our published methods31.
As stated above, rs2069705 and rs2069709 are two upstream variants (i.e., SNPs in the promoter region) ofIFNG.
Though previous studies established associations between rs2069705 or rs2069709 and various disease status including CM, there is no report studying the relationship between these two SNPs in combination and serious malaria disease outcomes such as SMA and mortality.
As such, rs2069705 and rs2069709 were selected for investigation in the current study.
It is well known that genetic variants in the promoter region potentially SNPs in the upstream region can affect TFBSs, altering promoter activity and gene transcript level51imparting functional gene expression changes.
Therefore, in-silico analyses of TFBSs around the two SNPs within the region containing the variants was retrieved from TRANSFAC database35.
Previous reports indicating that the two SNPs and/or their haplotypes are associated with both infectious and non-infectious diseases38–41informed additional selection criteria.
DNA was obtained from buccal swabs using the Buccal Amp™ DNA extraction kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).
The genomic DNA was then amplified with the Genomiphi V2 DNA amplification kit (Cytiva Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA, USAGE Healthcare, Life Sciences, Amersham).
Both, The IFN-γ rs2069709G > T and rs2069705A > G SNPs were genotyped using the Taqman®5′ allelic discrimination Assay-By-Design reagents (Assay ID: C__15859685_10, and C_15944115_20, respectively) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) method, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Genotype data fromn= 941 study participants were utilized to analyze the association between genotypic variants and disease outcomes.
Data were analyzed using R version 4.4.0.
This study included two longitudinal cohorts of children.
Cohort 1 (n= 604) was enrolled between 2004 and 2008, and Cohort 2 (n= 337) was enrolled between 2009 and 2013.
The cohorts were enrolled and subsequently followed for 36 months under identical conditions.
To account for unmeasured confounding factors, such as potential shifts in malaria transmission over time, the cohorts were merged into a single dataset, and ‘cohort’ was included as a covariate to adjust for any temporal variation.
Metric variables at enrollment were compared across the aparasitemic, non-SMA, and SMA groups using one-way ANOVAs and Welch-corrected two-samplet-tests after visual inspection of box plots, histograms, and Q-Q plots to verify that the variables approximately follow normal distributions.
Chi-square tests for homogeneity compared the probability mass functions of categorical variables between groups.
For sparse contingency tables (one cell count < 20), a generalized Fisher’s exact test (Fisher-Freeman-Halton’s exact test) was used.
If not feasible, P-values were approximated using a bootstrap with B = 500,000 bootstrap repeats.
In consideration that haplotypes and diplotypes contain more information than alleles and genotypes for association studies52, haplotypes and diplotypes composed of rs2069709 and rs2069705 were constructed to investigate combinational effects (dominance, epistasis, position effects) of these two upstream variants ofIFNGon malaria outcomes in this study.
The frequency for each haplotype or diplotype derived from these two SNPs was estimated using PHASE v.2.1, available athttp://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/phase/download.html53.
Chi-square tests for homogeneity or a generalized Fisher’s exact test (with simulatedP-values if necessary) were used to identify differences in the frequency distributions of genotypes haplotypes and diplotypes between aparasitemic, non-SMA, and SMA groups.
Exact tests for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at the two SNPs were conducted as described54.
Due to low cell counts for some haplotypes, Fisher’s exact test assessed linkage equilibrium (LE) between the two loci.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) r² was determined using Haploview55.
An unbalanced design for multiple data points was used to examine the longitudinal hazard of malaria and SMA episodes since the number of observations per patient can differ due to acute visits and loss to follow-up.
To fully utilize the data and address this dependency structure, Andersen-Gill multiple-events-per-subject Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine the longitudinal hazard for malaria and SMA episodes.
Models were fitted using AIC-based forward-backward selection, and times to events were right-censored to account for instances, in which a patient remained free of malaria and/or SMA during clinical presentations.
The malaria and SMA model variables included age at 1st hospital visit (enrollment), HIV1 infection, cohort, sex, sickle cell genotypes (HbAS, HbSS, whilst HbAA as reference), andIFNGvariants.
The SMA model included two additional variables, no prior malaria episodes and previous malaria episodes expressed as a count variable, to consider the effect of malaria infections on the development of SMA.
The impact of covariates on hazard of mortality was analyzed by fitting a semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard model using AIC-based forward-backward selection.
For each patient, mortality or survival was recorded at the last hospital visit, which was used as the time to event, and censoring time in the case of survival.
Age at enrollment was included as a covariate, as it was hypothesized that children who experience their first malaria episode at an older age, are less likely to die.
The model was fitted using all-cause mortality, regardless of whether it was related to malaria infection, as the outcome variable.
