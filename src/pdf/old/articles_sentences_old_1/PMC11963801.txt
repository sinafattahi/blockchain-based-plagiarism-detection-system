Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DA) is relatively rare and highly co‐existent with prostate adenocarcinoma (AC).
This study aimed to investigate the distinctive genomic profiles of patients with DA compared to those without.
Blood samples were obtained from 144 patients (36 with DA and 108 without DA) who were diagnosed from 2017 to 2023 at West China Hospital.
We performed cell‐free DNA sequencing to investigate the genomic differences between patients with DA [DA(+)] and those without [DA(−)], and explored the potential associations between their mutational status and prognosis.
Pathogenic and likely pathogenic alterations were included for analysis.
We identified that AR pathway [16/36 (44.4%) versus 24/108 (22.2%),p= 0.017] and WNT pathway [6/36 (16.7%) versus 5/108 (4.6%),p= 0.029] mutations were significantly enriched in DA(+) compared to DA(−) patients.
Mutation ofFOXA1, as a key component of the AR pathway, demonstrated markedly higher prevalence in the DA(+) over the DA(−) cohort [25% (9/36) versus 4.6% (5/108),p= 0.0012].
The DNA damage repair mutation rate and the homologous recombination repair deficiency scores appeared to be comparable between the DA(+) and DA(−) patients.
In the metastatic population, DA was characterized by a higher speckle‐type POZ protein (SPOP) mutation rate.TP53mutation was associated with a deteriorating prognosis for both DA(+) and DA(−) patients in terms of castration‐free survival.
In conclusion, our findings provide further genomic insights into prostate cancer with ductal morphology and are instructive for the diagnosis and treatment of DA.
Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DA), featured by a papillary structure or cribriform glands lined with tall columnar pseudostratified epithelial cells, occurs in approximately 10% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients while coexisting with acinar adenocarcinoma (AC) [1].
DA exhibits a high rate of de novo visceral metastases with a relatively low baseline prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) level, leading to diagnostic challenges and poor patient prognosis [1,2].
Previous studies showed that, in the M0 cohort, the presence of DA was independently associated with a poor response to conventional hormone therapy [3,4].
Conversely, among the metastatic population undergoing androgen deprivation therapy, DA appeared not to be correlated with adverse clinical outcomes [5].
A multi‐omics analysis by Gillardet alreported comparable AR activity between DA and AC [6], while our earlier work indicated that the presence of DA could serve as a potential prognostic marker for advanced PCa, inducing responsiveness to the potent androgen‐synthesis inhibitor, abiraterone [7].
These findings underscore the importance of elucidating the molecular mechanism of DA pathogenesis, especially the AR pathway.
However, contemporary genomic research on DA is scarce, possibly due to its rarity.
Several studies have conducted tissue‐based genomic sequencing on DA, while some of the results appeared to be heterogeneous, typically regarding the abundance of DNA damage repair pathway mutations [8,9].
Liquid biopsy has demonstrated advantages over traditional tissue‐based sequencing in providing dynamic molecular insights into PCa.
It effectively captures intratumor heterogeneity, which cannot be accurately assessed by a single biopsy specimen, especially in metastatic cases [10].
Additionally, liquid biopsy is less invasive and offers highly concordant mutational results when compared to traditional tissue‐based genomic sequencing [11].
Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the genomic profiles of patients with [DA(+)] and without DA [DA(−)] using cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing.
Additionally, we explored potential cfDNA‐derived prognosticators for both DA(+) and DA(−).
In this study, we retrospectively collected 144 PCa samples from 2017 to 2023 at West China Hospital, including 36 patients with DA and 108 without.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient for sample collection, regular follow‐up, and sequential data analysis.
The entire study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital.
Clinicopathologic and demographic data, including treatment line, metastatic stage (bone and visceral metastasis), age at sample collection, International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade, and baseline PSA level, were collected.
The majority of patients in the hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) stage were treated with maximal androgen blockade (MAB) or MAB plus radiotherapy (34/41, 82.9%), while the remaining four patients received either abiraterone (1/41), docetaxel (1/41), or apalutamide (2/41).
In the castration‐resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cohort, 87.5% (21/24) of patients received novel hormone therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide) as their first‐line treatment, with the remaining three patients treated with docetaxel.
The time point of sample collection was also recorded based on the treatment status of patients, specifically the treatment‐naïve, HSPC, and CRPC stages.
DA is characterized by papillary structures or cribriform glands lined by tall columnar pseudostratified cells arranged in cribriform, papillary, or solid patterns featured by distinctive metastatic behaviors [12].
Patients were diagnosed as having DA based on pathological evaluation of prostatic biopsy samples.
The hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunohistochemistry results of prostate cancer with and without DA are presented in supplementary material, FigureS1.
The percentage of DA was evaluated by experienced uropathologists according to the fifth edition of the WHO classification of urogenital tumors (supplementary material, TableS1) [12].
For patients receiving both radical prostatectomy (RP) and biopsy, the DA percentage was determined from the RP samples.
Notably, patients with other unique morphological features (e.g., intraductal AC of the prostate, neuroendocrine prostate cancer) were excluded from this study.
Upon receipt, whole blood samples were centrifuged at 1600gfor approximately 10 min at room temperature.
Following centrifugation, the buffy coat was manually isolated and transferred to new tubes for genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction.
Subsequently, the plasma layer was meticulously transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and subjected to a second centrifugation step at 16,000gfor another 10 min at 4°C to maximize the elimination of residual cells as well as cell debris.
The isolation of cfDNA from the plasma was carried out using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocol.
DNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
DNA extraction from white blood cells was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
For the construction of cfDNA libraries, 30–60 ng of cfDNA was utilized with the Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA), incorporating Unique Molecular Identifiers to maximally eliminate background noise.
Similarly, gDNA libraries were constructed using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Targeted sequencing of DNA sequences of interest was achieved using a customized set of biotinylated DNA probes and next‐generation sequencing panel kits for both cfDNA and gDNA.
The constructed libraries were subsequently loaded onto the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for paired‐end sequencing with 75 base pairs (bp).
Paired‐end reads obtained from sequencing were mapped using the Burrows‐Wheeler alignment maximal exact matches algorithm.
To ensure accurate mutation calling, particularly for variants with low allele frequency in cfDNA, a robust filtering model based on the binomial test was developed.
Single‐nucleotide variations (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (Indels), and fusions were called using a heuristic filtering strategy, taking parameters such as base quality, mapping quality, and supporting reads into consideration.
Copy number variations in cfDNA were determined using an internally developed method with default parameters.
The 90‐gene detection panel with the corresponding pathway is listed in supplementary material, TableS2.
Germline alterations were detected using white blood cells, while somatic mutations were detected through cfDNA, respectively.
It should be mentioned that for both somatic and germline mutations, only pathogenic or very likely pathogenic variants were selected for further analyses according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria [13].
Tumor mutation burden (TMB) scores were calculated based on structural mutations within each megabase pair detected in the whole genome.
To validate the identified mutations, all results underwent manual review utilizing the Integrative Genomics Viewer to eliminate false positives [14].
Additionally, Gaussian kernel smoothing with StatsModels 0.8.0 was employed to accurately calculate the probability density distributions of mutant and wild‐type fragments.
Hematopoietic expansion‐related variants were ruled out by comparing to the healthy individual data from the genomic database of West China Hospital by referring to the previous publication [15].
To estimate genomic scars of tumor samples, homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) scores were calculated by the unweighted sum of large‐scale state transition (LST), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI) [16].
Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test.
Fisher's test or chi‐squared test was performed accordingly to assess the genomic differences between DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts.
Survival analysis was conducted and plotted as Kaplan–Meier curves.
All of the statistical analyses in this study were performed using ‘survival’, ‘survminer’, and ‘ggplot2’ packages, and the heatmap was drawn based on ‘ComplexHeatmap’ and ‘pheatmap’ packages from R (version 4.3.2).
Thepvalue <0.05 indicated statistical significance.
A total of 36 patients with DA and 108 patients without DA underwent genomic sequencing (Figure1A).
Baseline characteristics of both cohorts are displayed and compared in Table1.
Generally, patients diagnosed with DA exhibited bone metastatic rates similar to those in the DA(−) cohort at the time of blood sample extraction.
However, the DA(+) cohort demonstrated a higher rate of visceral metastasis than the DA(−) cohort (22% versus 7.4%,p= 0.028) and significantly lower baseline PSA levels (p= 0.007).
Other baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two cohorts.

The detailed somatic and germline mutational profiles of both patients with and without DA are depicted in Figure1B.
Overall, 193 SNVs [59 in DA(+) and 134 in DA(−)] were observed in 101/144 patients.
TMB values were also comparable between the DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts (3.2 Mut/Mb versus 4.5 Mut/Mb,p= 0.609) (supplementary material, FigureS2A).
We performed co‐existing mutation or mutual exclusivity analyses for the total cohort, DA(+) and DA(−) (supplementary material, FigureS2B–S2D), respectively.UGT1A1was found to co‐exist withCYP2C19in both the DA(−) and the total cohorts.
However, in the DA(+) cohort, no top genes (≥5) showed either co‐existence or mutual exclusivity after multitest adjustments (Figure1B).
Pathogenic germline mutation rates were comparable between DA(+) and DA(−) cases (6/36 versus 11/108,p= 0.37).
In the DA(+) cohort, the most frequent somatic alteration wasFOXA1(9/36, 25%), followed by speckle‐type POZ protein (SPOP) (6/36, 16.7%), CYP2C19 (5/36, 13.9%), andAPC(4/36, 11.1%).
For the DA(−) cohort, the most frequent somatic mutation wasCYP2C19(19/108, 17.6%), followed byUGT1A1(16/108, 14.8%), TP53 (11/108, 10.2%), andAR(8/108, 7.4%).
Additionally, theETS‐fusion rates between the DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts showed no significant differences (3/36 versus 7/108,p= 0.711).
We further investigated the differential genomic alterations between the DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts based on classical PCa‐related pathways, which are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.
The mutational profiles of the AR pathway are displayed in Figure2A.
We found that AR pathway mutations were significantly enriched in DA(+) compared to the DA(−) cohort [16/36 (44.4%) versus 24/108 (22.2%),p= 0.017], with 12 (50%) found in the population with DA content ≥10% and 4 (33%) in patients with DA content less than 10%.FOXA1[9/36 (25%) versus 5/108 (4.6%),p= 0.0012] (Figure2B,Cand supplementary material, TableS3) mutations were enriched in the DA(+) population.
Additionally,NCOR1,NCOR2, andARmutation rates were comparable between the DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts (Figure2B).
In the M1 cohort, theSPOPmutation rate was higher in the DA(+) cohort compared with DA(−) [4/17 (23.5%) versus 3/56 (5.4%),p= 0.047].
Five out of sixSPOPalterations were found in patients with DA content ≥10%.

The total mutation rate of the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway was similar between the DA(+) and DA(−) groups [8/36 (22%) versus 27/108 (25%),p= 0.825] (Figure3A).
Given that HRD scores more comprehensively reflect the consequence of loss of function in homologous recombination repair than DDR mutations alone [16], we subsequently compared the HRD scores (Figure3A) between the DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts.
The values of LOH (Figure3B), LST (Figure3C) and TAI (Figure3D) were also compared.
The results indicated no significant differences between the two cohorts.BRCA2germline mutations were also comparable (2/36 versus 1/108,p= 0.154).

For the WNT signaling pathway, four key genes were targeted for genomic sequencing:APC,CTNNB1,RNF43, andZNRF3.
The WNT pathway mutation rate was elevated in the DA(+) cohort compared to the DA(−) cohort [6/36 (16.7%) versus 5/108 (4.6%),p= 0.029] (supplementary material, FigureS3A).
Five out of six WNT pathway alterations were detected in patients with high DA content (≥10%).
The mutation rate ofAPCappeared to be comparable [4/36 (11.1%) versus 3/108 (2.8%),p= 0.066] (supplementary material, FigureS3B).
TwoCTNNB1mutations were observed in the DA(+) cohort and the DA(−) cohort [2/36 (5.6%) versus 2/108 (1.9%),p= 0.260], respectively (supplementary material, FigureS3A).
As forRNF43andZNRF3, they were not detected in either the DA(+) or the DA(−) cohort.
At the end of follow‐up, 62 (43.1%) patients developed castration resistance.
Associations between genomic alterations and castration‐free survival (CFS) in the DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts are displayed in Figure4A,B, respectively.
We found that theTP53mutation was associated with shorter CFS (Figure4C,D) in both the DA(+) (median: 7.9 months versus.25.7 months,p= 0.04) and DA(−) (median: 24 months versus.28.5 months,p= 0.088) cohorts.
At the pathway level, cell cycle, MAPK, and PI3K pathway mutations suggested poorer CFS in the DA(−) cohort.
However, none of the above correlations were detected in the DA(+) group.

In this study, we conducted a genomic evaluation to assess the mutational profiles of patients with and without DA within the Asian population.
AR pathway mutations, particularlyFOXA1, were significantly enriched in patients diagnosed with DA.
WNT pathway mutations were also more commonly observed in the DA(+) cohort.
The DDR alteration rates and HRD values were comparable between the two cohorts.
Additional findings included the prognostic value of theTP53mutation for CFS in both DA(+) and DA(−) cohorts.
Ductal AC is recognized as a rare and aggressive variant of PCa, characterized by unique metastatic patterns and serving as an independent poor prognosticator.
The 2022 WHO guidelines debated the reclassification of DA, considering whether DA should be considered a subtype of acinar AC, before maintaining it as a distinct morphological type of PCa rather than integrating it into acinar AC [12].
Additional investigations are warranted regarding the similarities and differences between DA and acinar AC of the prostate.
Serving as the upstream molecular regulator of the AR pathway,FOXA1mutations have been reported to potentially induce divergent effects on AR pathway activities—either inhibition or promotion [17].
According to Adams' study, forkhead mutants of F254_E255 and M253_N256 indels inFOXA1, which were also observed in our cohort, would induce a pioneering effect by increasing the chromatin opening rate and transcriptional activity, thus potentially facilitating subsequent AR binding [18].
This explained the noninferior or numerically higher AR activity scores observed in DA compared to AC in the Gillardet alstudy [6].
Boysen's team investigated the potential correlations betweenSPOP/CHD1mutational status and abiraterone efficacy.
They noted that patients withSPOPmutations presented high sensitivity to abiraterone [19].
In our study, we have found that, in the M1 cohort, the DA(+) group harbored a significantly higherSPOPmutation rate than the DA(−) group.
Though highly hypothesis‐generating, we assume that a higherSPOPmutation rate in metastatic DA(+) might contribute to its considerable response to abiraterone [7].
Enrichment in WNT‐pathway mutations is associated with PCa progression, metastasis, and castration resistance [20].
It is also relevant to the cribriform morphogenesis of PCa [6].
Suteraet alindicated that the WNT pathway was strongly associated with a higher visceral metastasis rate [21], withAPCmutation being especially notable in the Chinese population [22].
We observed that the WNT pathway mutations, mainlyAPC, were more frequent in the DA(+) tumors compared to the DA(−) PCa, thereby partially explaining the higher visceral metastasis rate observed in the DA(+) population from a genomic perspective.
Similar findings reported in other studies further corroborate our results [6,8].
Unlike some studies that linked DA with an increased detection rate of DDR mutation [9], we observed no significant differences in DDR pathway mutations between patients with or without DA regardless of their metastatic stage.
This finding aligns with Kobayashiet al's study, which reported no DDR alterations in any samples from aggressive DA [8].
While HRD scores suggest genomic scars and reflect the consequences of loss of function in homologous recombination repair in tumor samples [16], the HRD scores were also comparable between the DA(+) and DA(−) groups.
Consequently, we hypothesized that PCa with ductal morphology may not feature a frequent occurrence of DNA damage repair deficiency.
This study should be interpreted with several limitations.
First, the sample size in the DA(+) cohort was relatively small due to the rarity of PCa with ductal morphology, restricting the robustness of our findings.
Second, samples collected from DA(+) and DA(−) were based on a 12‐core prostate biopsy, and some cases presenting coexistence of both DA and prostate AC may cause bias.
In conclusion, DA was characterized by a higher AR pathway mutation rate compared to DA(−) PCa, typically involving theFOXA1mutation.
Additionally, the DA(+) cohort harbored more WNT pathway mutations.
The DDR mutation rate and HRD scores were comparable between the DA(+) and DA(−).TP53mutation served as a deteriorating prognosticator for patients with and without DA in terms of CFS.
Further large‐scale studies are warranted for additional validation.
