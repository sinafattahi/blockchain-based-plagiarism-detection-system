The present research study describes the Venetoclax (VEN)‐related substances test method using RP‐HPLC/DAD techniques.
It was developed and validated according to ICH Q14 and Q2(R2) guidelines.
The substances were separated using an X‐Bridge Phenyl column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm) and a gradient program.
The mobile phase A, consist 0.02 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) buffer and acetonitrile in an 80:20 v/v ratio.
Mobile phase B was prepared using a 75:25 v/v mixture of acetonitrile and a pH 8.0 buffer and well mixed.
The flow rate remains constant at 1.0 mL/min, traversing an appropriate gradient program.
The VEN and its impurities were detected at 280 nm, with an injection volume of 15 μL and a runtime of 130 min.
Moreover, we identified proper degradation impurities and sensitivity of VEN due to forced‐degradation study experiments.
The linearity and range of the testing procedure were validated by computingr2values over 0.999.
All organic impurities were recovered at a rate of 97.6%–106.0% with a relative standard deviation of 0.11%–4.35%.
A robustness test was conducted utilizing the AQbD methodology.
The proposed method was stability‐indicating in nature and can be used for commercial samples in the pharmaceutical industries.
Venetoclax (VEN) is a specific inhibitor of the anti‐apoptotic protein B‐cell Lymphoma 2.
It is utilized for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with 17p deletion (Vaxman et al.2018; Leverson et al.2017).
VEN is around tenfold more effective than navitoclax in inducing apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Juárez‐Salcedo et al.2019; Mihalyova et al.2018).
It is a solid ranging from pale yellow to dark yellow, with the empirical formula C45H50ClN7O7S and a molecular weight of 868.44.
VEN is chemically characterized as 4‐(4‐{[2‐(4‐chlorophenyl)‐4,4‐dimethylcyclohex‐1‐en‐1‐yl]methyl}piperazin‐1‐yl)‐N‐({3‐nitro‐4‐[(tetrahydro‐2H‐pyran‐4‐ylmethyl)amino]phenyl}sulfonyl)‐2‐(1H‐pyrrolo[2,3‐b]pyridin‐5‐yloxy)benzamide, accompanied by the chemical structures of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and its associated impurities depicted in the Figure1.
VENCLEXTA tablets for oral use are available as pale yellow or beige tablets containing 10, 50, or 100 mg of VEN as the active component.
VEN is classified as a BCS class IV compound (Riedmaier et al.2018), exhibiting low water solubility ( < 0.0042 μg/mL at pH 7.4) and significant hydrophobicity (Logp= 8.1).
VEN has seven process impurities and two degrading impurities.
(a) Venetoclax, (b) Venetoclax‐N oxide (Impurity‐II), (c) Venetoclax oxidative impurity, (d) Venetoclax (Impurity‐III), (e) Impurity G, (f) Impurity D, (g) Impurity E, (h) Impurity C, (i) Impurity A, (j) Impurity B.
A literature study revealed that many chromatographic techniques have been employed for the quantification of VEN in pharmaceutical formulations (Zigart and Casar2020).
Although many studies assessed VEN in conjunction with other medication combinations, only a limited number exclusively evaluated VEN and its degradation products ( David Raju2022).
VEN estimation and metabolite assessment in plasma samples have been conducted mostly by LC–MS and HPLC methodologies (Yasu et al.2022; Eisenmann et al.2020; Fukuda et al.2022; Divya Bhargavi et al.2023).
Nonetheless, most of these techniques encounter issues with mobile phase buffers, columns, and mobile phase pH.
Furthermore, the resolution between impurities is insufficient, and forced degradation was not conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline2003; ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline1996; ICH Harmonised Guideline2023).
Moreover, the documented methodologies did not encompass all VEN impurities, including process‐related and degrading impurities.
The aim of this work was to provide a straightforward, specific, linear, robust, tough, and stability‐indicating technique for quantifying VEN and its associated impurities in pharmaceutical formulations.
The stability‐indicating technique is a proven quantitative analytical approach that often includes forced deterioration and validation experiments (Bakshi and Singh2002).
Building on these prior findings, we conducted degradation experiments and identified two possible impurities in the medicinal product during stress testing in the presence of peroxides.
The chemical exhibits stability under both physical and hydrolytic degradation conditions, as corroborated by validation criteria.
This approach is successful for identifying VEN and its associated impurities while being cost‐efficient.
The existing regulatory guidelines explicitly mandate that the methodology must be refined or demonstrated to be resilient via the statistical technique Quality by Design (QbD) (Bandaru et al.2024; Rathnakar et al.2023).

The literature indicates that the VEN molecule has low polarity.
Consequently, we originally selected an X bridge C8 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and an ammonium buffer at pH 4.0.
Subsequently, blank, placebo, and spiked sample solutions were prepared in accordance with the specified specifications.
Moreover, they were accurately administered into the LC‐DAD apparatus.
The data indicate that it was not utilized.
Subsequently, we conducted one further experiment; nevertheless, it proved to be useless.
Additional information is available in Table2.
Various stationary phases were employed in the subsequent testing, including X‐Bridge Phenyl (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm).
Phenyl stationary phases engage with molecules including aromatic groups or unsaturated bonds via π‐π interactions.
A 20 mM solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer was used to enhance the separation of impurities.
Subsequently, we experimented with isocratic and gradient protocols in many configurations.
