In the setting of high hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemicity, we studied the cost‐effectiveness of universal HBV screen‐and‐treat strategies for averting HBV‐related morbidity and mortality in Hong Kong, where diagnosis and treatment coverages are low.
An age–sex‐specific compartmental model for 2000–2040 was developed, with the incorporation of population‐based screening strategies targeting different age groups.
With a one‐time HBV screening programme in 2025–2029, 3.6%–8.9% of HBV‐related deaths could be averted.
We evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of the screening strategies with primary‐care‐based management in different scenarios with components of annual drug cost levels, screening programme duration, starting year and targeted age groups.
Incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, with the willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) threshold set at USD100,000/quality‐adjusted life years (QALY).
At the standard drug cost level, only the screening strategy targeting the 40–49 years old is cost‐saving.
When drug cost decreases to a low level, the strategy targeting the 35–49 years old (ICER USD97,042/QALY gained) is likely to be cost‐effective and screening 35–59 years old is marginally cost‐effective.
In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, screening 40–49 years old (50%) and 35–59 years old (42%) have a half–half probability of being the most cost‐effective at USD100,000/QALY WTP threshold, but increased to 93% for screening 35–59 years old at USD150,000/QALY threshold.
From scenario analysis, deferred initiation of screening and unlimited programme duration would increase the ICER.
Universal HBV screening targeting individuals aged 35–59 years or 40–49 years in the general population, with an earlier start and limited duration of the programme, is likely to be cost‐effective.
In 2022, the global population burden of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections was 254 million, and that of hepatitis B‐related deaths was high at 1.1 million each year [1].
Unlike the relatively ineffective and expensive HBV therapy of the past, current antiviral therapy could effectively suppress HBV viral load, slow the disease progression of cirrhosis and reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2].
A high treatment coverage of chronic HBV infection is crucial to minimise the infection burden in the population.
Instead of setting treatment initiation criteria at the severe disease stage, which was usually too late for health improvement, earlier treatment initiation for chronic HBV infection with the inclusion of people with HBV DNA above 2000 IU/mL and elevated alanine transaminase has been recommended [2].
World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended adult HBV testing in populations with a prevalence of HBsAg ≥ 2% [2].
HBV screening followed by treatment has been shown to be cost‐effective in economic evaluation studies in China [3], Australia [4], the United States [5] and Gambia [6].
However, the specificity of the cost‐effective screen‐and‐treat strategy could vary geographically, as the disease burden is shaped by local transmission patterns, the age structure of the population, coverage of public health interventions, including HBV vaccination, testing and treatment, and the cost.
Hong Kong is a highly endemic city in Asia, with the HBsAg prevalence high at 8.8% in 2001, which fell gradually to 7.2% in 2015/16 and 6.3% in 2018–2020 [7,8,9].
To reduce the HBV incidence, a universal neonatal HBV vaccination programme, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) injection for infants, and antenatal HBV screening have been implemented since the 1980s [8].
The slow decline in the overall HBV burden is attributed to the persistence of chronic infection in a significant proportion of HBV‐infected individuals who have remained untreated.
Notably, the proportion of individuals who were aware of their infection status had remained at a similar level over the years, at 59% in 2018–2020 and 62% in 2020–2022 [7,10].
Only half of those aware of their status were in care and/or on HBV treatment in Hong Kong in 2020–2022 [10].
Universal screening of the adult population is a potentially effective strategy to identify otherwise undiagnosed infections in a high‐endemicity setting.
In this study, we evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of different universal HBV screen‐and‐treat strategies for averting HBV‐related morbidity and mortality in a high‐endemicity setting.
This is an economic evaluation study, which projects the HBV infection burden in Hong Kong in 2000–2040 using mathematical modelling and estimates and compares the cost and utility of base‐case scenario (i.e., no universal screening) and different one‐off universal screen‐and‐treat strategies to identify the cost‐effective strategies.
Universal screening involves the screening of all persons in the population meeting the screening criteria, in reference to the specific ages referred to in this study, bundling with the management of asymptomatic chronic infections in primary care [11].
However, symptomatic individuals with chronic HBV infection are assumed to be tested regardless of age group.
The screening is one‐off in nature as only one instead of repeat testing is performed per person, over a defined screening period.
This is an open, age–sex‐specific compartmental model, with a projection of HBV transmission dynamics from 2000 to 2040 in Hong Kong.
The model was developed in R programming language, with month as the time step.
A total of 15 age groups are included in the model, namely year 0, 5 years interval from 1 to 49 years old, 50–59, 60–69, 70–84 and 85+ years old.
In each year, newborns and immigrants are added to the model, whereas deaths and emigrants are moved out.
Model compartments include the status of susceptible (unvaccinated), susceptible (vaccinated), acute infection, fulminant hepatitis B, liver transplant, recovery and status at care continuum (i.e., undiagnosed, diagnosed and treated) for disease stages of chronic infection, compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and HCC (Figure1).
Untreated individuals with low viral load (< 2000 IU/mL) are assumed to be non‐infectious, which accounts for around 76% of females and 58% of males with HBsAg positivity [10].
Two forces of infection are included in the model, one for mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) and one for sexual transmission.
Model flow diagram for HBV transmission.
CC, compensated cirrhosis; CHB, chronic hepatitis B infection; DCC, decompensated cirrhosis; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.
The force of infection for MTCT is determined by age‐specific HBsAg prevalence of antenatal women, risk of HBV transmission adjusted by HBV treatment status of chronically infected antenatal women and proportion of high viral load, vaccination status of the infants, HBIg injection to infants.
Only mothers in acute or chronic infection, CC or DC stages are assumed to be infectious.
On the other hand, females with acute infection, diagnosed DC, undiagnosed or diagnosed HCC and liver transplant are assumed to have a zero fertility rate.
From 2021 onwards, 95% of HBV‐infected pregnant women with high viral load are assumed to have received treatment according to public service guidelines.
The force of infection for sexual transmission is determined by the risk of HBV transmission per sex partner, condom efficacy and usage rate, the proportion of being sexually active in 1 year by age groups [7] and the prevalence of HBsAg of the opposite sex (i.e., heterosexual transmission).
Only infected individuals with acute infection, untreated chronic infection with high viral load and those in the CC and DC stages are assumed to be infectious.
Demographic data including age–sex‐specific population size, fertility rate, sex ratio of infants and death rate were collected from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department [12].
Parameter values for age–sex‐specific sexual behaviour including a proportion of being sexually active in the year, condom usage rate and HBV vaccination coverage were summarised from a previous HBV seroprevalence study conducted by the Research Team [7] (TableS1).
Parameter values related to biological transmission risk, disease progression rate, excess death rate related to hepatitis B, seroclearance rate, coverage of testing and treatment in Hong Kong and vaccination coverage in migrants from Mainland China were summarised from the literature [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22] and annual surveillance reports in Hong Kong [8].
Ethical approval from the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics of The Chinese University of Hong Kong was obtained (SBRE‐22‐0608).
The age–sex‐specific prevalence of HBsAg estimated in community research projects conducted in 2001 [8], 2015–2016 [9], 2018–2020 [7] and in the Population Health Survey 2020–2022 [10] was collected for model fitting.
We used maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) under a beta‐binomial distribution in R (bbmle2 package) for fitting.
The prevalence data in family members of HBV‐infected individuals in 1983/84 [23] was used for estimating the initial population with chronic HBV infection in 1981.
Data from literature are used for cost estimation, including vaccination expenditure with the incorporation of logistical expenditure, testing cost with inclusion of related investigations (laboratory test for anti‐HBs, HBsAg, HBV DNA; rapid test and self‐test of HBsAg, liver function test, renal function test, alpha‐fetoprotein, ultrasonography) [11], annual treatment cost including consultation and investigation costs, indirect costs and drug costs (TableS2) [3,24].
In the base‐case scenario, we assume all consultations are at specialist services (status quo).
In screening scenarios, screening strategies are supported by primary‐care‐based management, which includes HBV screening at primary care, 85% of cases diagnosed with asymptomatic chronic infections receiving consultation at primary care and 15% at specialists.
For the drug cost in the real‐world setting, we assume around 85% of treated patients took entecavir, which was listed in the public service sector, while the rest used either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide by different proportions of generic and branded drugs (standard annual drug cost of USD699 assuming 100% branded drug; medium level of USD606 assuming 80% branded drug; low level of USD465 assuming 50% branded drug).
The upper bound utility estimation across HBV infection stages in a previous study [3] is used for the calculation of utility loss.
In the base‐case scenario, we assume all HBV tests (HBsAg and anti‐HBs) were performed in the laboratory.
Testing and treatment coverage follow the value in 2022.
Considering that point‐of‐care (POC) test costs less and involves testing service by healthcare providers or trained staff, we assume all HBV screen‐and‐treat scenarios adopt the POC testing approach, at the acceptable 30% annual screening coverage for unscreened asymptomatic persons.
The screen‐and‐treat scenarios are varied by components of (1) duration of programme (3 years, 4 years, 5 years, ongoing as routine), (2) level of annual drug cost (USD699, USD606, USD465), (3) target age groups for screening (35–49 years old, 35–59 years old, 35–69 years old, 35–84 years old, 40–49 years old, 40–59 years old, 40–69 years old, 45–59 years old and 45–69 years old) and (4) programme initiation year (2025 for all screen‐and‐treat strategies, and 2026, 2027, 2028 for screening targeting population aged 35–59 years) (FigureS1).
With reference to the average of the annual composite consumer price index in 2009–2021 in Hong Kong [25], we assume a 1.6% annual inflation rate and a 3% annual discount rate for cost and quality‐adjusted life years (QALY) in the analysis.
No inflation rate is assumed for drug cost, which is expected to decrease instead of increase over time.
Cumulative discounted cost and cumulative discounted QALY from 2025 to 2040 were calculated.
We ranked the strategies by effectiveness (i.e., cumulative discounted QALY) and then calculated the cumulative discounted incremental cost and cumulative discounted QALY gained (QALYG).
After excluding the strongly dominated (costs more but has negative QALYG compared with an alternative strategy) and extendedly dominated (higher ICER and fewer benefits than a more effective strategy) strategies, the next best alternative strategy was selected.
The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs), as defined by additional cost per QALY gain of the next screen‐and‐treat strategies with higher effectiveness, were calculated.
R package (dampack) was used to calculate ICER and plot cost‐effectiveness planes.
A strategy is considered as likely cost‐effective if the ICER is lower than the willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) threshold, which is defined as the maximum amount that the public is willing to pay for health gains.
We set the WTP threshold at USD100,000, approximately 2 times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita after adjustment of the inflation rate in 2022 [26], which was within the recommended maximum 3 times GDP per capita (USD150,000) by WHO [27].
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed with 5000 simulations for each selected screen‐and‐treat strategy to analyse the impact of the combined uncertainty of 11 key parameters (TableS3).
R package (hesim) was used to summarise PSA results through the generation of cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves and cost‐effectiveness acceptability frontier.
One‐way sensitivity analyses around the same list of key parameters, except for the exclusion of the inflation rate and screening rate but inclusion of the treatment rate for chronic HBV infection, were performed for the strategies with the highest and second highest probability of being cost‐effective.
In addition, to analyse the impact of the HBsAg testing method on cost‐effectiveness, scenarios for blood taking with laboratory tests and self‐testing were separately set for the most cost‐effective strategy.
In the base‐case model, the estimated prevalence of chronic HBV infection was high at 8.2% in 2004, followed by a continuous drop to 6.1% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2040 (Figure2).
The model estimation of the overall prevalence fits with the previous seroprevalence studies except for the 2001 study (TableS4, FigureS2) [4,8,9].
The estimated annual incidence of chronic HBV infections would drop from 0.2 per 100,000 persons in 2020 to 0.1 per 100,000 persons between 2025 and 2040.
The estimated number of chronic HBV infections was 458,135 in 2023, which would drop to 362,669 in 2030 and to 249,850 in 2040.
It is estimated that only 58% of infected cases will be diagnosed and 57% will receive treatment by 2040 (TableS5).
Between 2025 and 2040, the discounted cumulative cost would be USD6,562,033,788, and the discounted sum of utility loss would be 835,674 QALY.
The number of HBV‐related deaths in 2030 would be 2416 (i.e., 31 per 100,000), and the total number in 2025–2040 would be 36,243.
Baseline estimation of prevalence and incidence of chronic HBV infection in the general population in 2000–2040.
For a screening programme starting from 2025 with an annual 30% coverage for unscreened asymptomatic persons, under standard annual drug cost (USD699) with a WTP threshold of USD100,000/QALY, screening programming starting in 2025 targeting individuals aged 40–49 years is a cost‐saving strategy (ICER‐USD136,090/QALYG) (Figure3).
Cost‐effectiveness planes for a one‐time screening programme by using POC test starting from 2025, with an annual 30% screening coverage, at standard annual drug cost (USD699), by different durations of screening programme and target age groups.
ICER in 2025–2040 represents the additional cost per QALY gain of the next screen‐and‐treat strategies.
By reducing the annual drug cost to a low level (USD465), strategies targeting individuals aged 40–49 years are cost‐saving (ICER‐USD156,593/QALYG) and screening 35–49 years old in a 3‐year programme (ICER USD97,042/QALYG)is likely to be cost‐effective at the USD100,000/QALY WTP threshold (Figure4).
The cost‐effectiveness increases with a shorter duration of the screening programme (from 5 years to 3 years), keeping other screening components constant.
In a 5‐year programme, only the strategy targeting individuals aged 40–49 years (averted 3.6% HBV‐related deaths compared with base‐case) is cost‐effective.
The strategy targeting individuals aged 35–49 years (ICER USD101,251/QALYG) could avert 4.5% HBV‐related deaths while targeting individuals aged 35–59 years could avert more HBV‐related deaths (8.9% less than base‐case, ICER USD105,448/QALYG), which slightly exceeds the WTP threshold.
If the programme duration could be shortened to 3 years (ICER USD97,042/QALYG) or 4 years (ICER USD99,322/QALYG), targeting individuals aged 35–49 years would become the most cost‐effective.
By expanding the screening age range, more HBV‐related deaths could be averted (TableS5).
When the annual drug cost is at the medium level (USD606), we observe a similar pattern, with screening individuals aged 40–49 years being a cost‐saving strategy (FigureS3).

ICER in 2025–2040 represents the additional cost per QALY gain of the next screen‐and‐treat strategies; label text in blue for ICER under WTP USD100,000/QALY, in orange for ICER under USD110,000/QALY.
The cost‐effectiveness of 5‐year screen‐and‐treat strategies for 40–49 years old, 35–49 years old, 35–59 years old and base‐case scenarios was further compared in PSA (Figure5).
By setting the WTP threshold at USD100,000/QALY, the strategy targeting those aged 40–49 years has a 50% probability, while those aged 35–59 years have a 42% probability of being the most cost‐effective.
The probability of being the most cost‐effective strategy for screening targeting those aged 35–59 years increases along with a higher WTP threshold.
As shown in the cost‐effectiveness acceptability frontier, targeting those aged 35–59 years has an increasing chance of being the optimal strategy when the WTP threshold increases (93% chance at USD150,000/QALY WTP threshold).

If there was a delayed start of the screening programme for individuals aged 35–59 years, the ICER (2025–2040) in comparison with the base‐case scenario would increase along with the starting year (Figure6).
In sensitivity analysis with different HBV testing methods for a 5‐year programme starting in 2025 targeting those aged 35–59 years, the difference in cost‐effectiveness between the self‐test and POC test is small, with the cost assumption at USD6.4 per self‐test and USD9.6 per POC test in 2023.

In one‐way sensitivity analysis, the impact on ICER by treatment recovery rate was very high, enabling ICER to range between ‐USD86,897/QALYG and ‐USD30,153/QALYG in the screen‐and‐treat strategy targeting those aged 40–49 years if the treatment recovery rate is 0.0164 and 0.0074, respectively (FigureS4).
Drug cost was the most influential parameter for screening individuals aged 35–59 years, and the second most influential parameter for those aged 40–49 years.
Chronic HBV infection cost for consultation and related investigations is an influential parameter in both screening strategies.
In the high HBV endemicity setting of Hong Kong, our cost‐effectiveness analyses suggested that a 5‐year screening programme for individuals aged 40–49 years with primary‐care‐based management, starting from 2025, is likely to be cost‐saving.
The screening programme for individuals aged 35–59 years with primary‐care‐based management at a low level of annual drug cost is marginally cost‐effective at a slightly higher WTP threshold of USD110,000/QALY.
This strategy is likely to be effective, which could avert 8.9% of HBV‐related deaths in 2025–2040 compared with the no screening scenario.
The impact of this strategy on mortality decline is similar to the estimated proportion of mortality decline in screening the 30–60 years old population in China [3].
Despite its cost‐effectiveness, the WHO 2030 mortality targets could not be met (estimated at 31 per 100,000 in this study vs. 4 per 100,000 in WHO targets) [28].
The 2030 HBV incidence targets could, however, be met, as shown by an estimated incidence of 0.1 per 100,000 persons (WHO targets of 2 per 100,000) in the base‐case scenario.
Different from the previous cost‐effectiveness analysis study, which highlighted the screening of the widest age range (18–70 years old) [3] or considering high screening coverage alone [4] as the most cost‐effective option, we have demonstrated that targeted screening of adults and middle‐aged (35–59 years old) in 2025 is likely to be a cost‐effective strategy for Hong Kong.
As shown in previous seroepidemiology studies, the prevalence of HBsAg in individuals born between 1966 and 1990 was high, ranging between 7.4% and 10.9% [7,8,9,10].
A study estimated that the lifetime cumulative incidence of HCC in HBV‐unvaccinated individuals was 0.06% at 25 years old and 0.14% at 30 years old [29].
Therefore, higher detection rates aside, individuals aged 35–59 years with chronic HBV infection might not have progressed to severe stages, which could maximise the benefits of HBV treatment.
The prevalence of HBsAg was lower in individuals born before 1960 [7], which partly explains the lower cost‐effectiveness of screen‐and‐treat strategies covering older age groups.
Starting the screen‐and‐treat programme earlier would be more cost‐effective than a delayed start.
This finding aligned with the previous cost‐effectiveness study for HBV screening in China [3].
In our screen‐and‐treat strategy, the age group combinations all start from 35 years old (i.e., born in or after 1990 if started in 2025 and in or after 1993 if started in 2028) to avoid the saturated proportion of vaccinated age cohorts due to delayed start, as mentioned in the previous study [3].
The reduced cost‐effectiveness of delayed start in our study is mainly due to disease progression to CC, DC, HCC or even death that could only be averted by earlier screening and treatment initiation.
In addition, the management cost for chronic infection is lower than CC, DC and HCC.
On the other hand, within the same age range for screening, say 35–59, a delay of 2 years means the individuals aged 58–59 years in 2025 would no longer be eligible for joining the 2027 programme.
We suggest a one‐time screening programme with a limited duration.
Compared with routine adult testing, strategies targeting different age groups in the limited duration programmes (the shorter, the better) are cost‐effective at a WTP threshold of USD100,000/QALY.
Although maintaining a routine screening service for adults in a specific age range could avert a slightly higher proportion (1% more) of HBV‐related deaths and achieve a higher proportion of HBV diagnosis (8% more) and treatment (8% more) compared with a 5‐year programme, the number of individuals in the population screened would almost double (TableS5).
The detection rate of HBV would likely drop over time as the prevalence of HBsAg decreases, but vaccination coverage increases with birth year; the effectiveness of screening would drop greatly.
Our results show that the same screen‐and‐treat strategy would become more cost‐effective (i.e., smaller ICER) over a longer time interval (2025–2030 vs. 2025–2040), suggesting a slower rise of cumulative discounted cost but a faster increase of cumulative discounted QALYG over time.
Whereas the expense for treatment of the identified cases would be life‐long, the QALYG due to delayed disease progression and decreased mortality risk increases over time.
If the economic evaluation timeframe is extended further to the year 2050 or even 2060, the cost‐effectiveness of the same strategy would be further improved.
We acknowledge a few limitations in this study, and the interpretation of study findings needs caution.
Firstly, as an age‐sex structured open model, the projection of HBV epidemiology may be affected by the age–sex structure and HBsAg prevalence of migrants and emigrants.
Also, a change in population structure in the future may affect the HBV epidemiology and re‐evaluation of epidemiology and screen‐and‐treat strategies would then be needed.
Secondly, the model assumes that 80% of individuals diagnosed with chronic HBV infection would start treatment regardless of viral load level.
This might overestimate the total treatment number and cost, as the current indications for antiviral treatment are limited to high viral load levels for chronic HBV infection [2].
However, this reserves the room for further relaxation of treatment eligibility criteria in the near future.
Third, although the options included in the HBV screen‐and‐treat strategy have considered real‐world practicality, the implementation options and costs involved, as well as additional costs on managing the side effects of specific treatment regimens such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [30] were not considered.
The acceptance and willingness to participate in the screening in the general population were not included in the model.
The capacity of hospitals to take care of all diagnosed individuals was not part of the model because hospital settings should be just one option, but not the only option.
Decentralisation of care and treatment to health centres, general outpatients, family medicine or even telemedicine followed by home delivery could be on the list in accordance with the severity [31,32,33].
In summary, one‐time HBV screening targeting specific age groups in the general population could be an effective intervention, which could avert HBV‐related morbidity and mortality burdens in the community.
It is likely to be cost‐effective under a careful selection of screen‐and‐treat strategies, including starting the programme earlier, setting a limited programme duration and covering adults and middle‐aged.
