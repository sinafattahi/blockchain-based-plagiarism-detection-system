To examine the excess deaths due to non-COVID-19 pathologies in Uruguayan prisons in 2021 vs. 2014-2023, and analyse the factors that contributed to them.
A non-experimental case study with quantitative and qualitative retrospective analysis was conducted.
All available data on the causes and circumstances of prisoner deaths from the year 2021 vs. 2014-2023 were analysed.
Contingency and risk tables were prepared.
A care process analysis tool was used in the qualitative study.
In 2021, a significant increase of deaths caused by diseases not due to COVID-19 was documented (rate person-years 296.35 vs. X̄ = 165.53 [P<0.001]).
The risk was also significant for the period (OR = 2.01 [CI 1,42-2,83]) and there was also an association with prison security (P<0.05).
A total of 63.4% of the deaths were associated with difficulties in the healthcare process.
The excess non-COVID-19 mortality in Uruguay prisons in 2021 was mainly due to restrictions on movement in prison and priority in the care of respiratory patients, which generated difficulties in accessing prison health services, delays in diagnosis and treatment of other pathologies.
Examinar el exceso de muertes por patologías no COVID-19 en cárceles del Uruguay durante el año 2021 frente a 2014-2023, y analizar qué factores contribuyeron a las mismas.
Investigación no experimental de estudio de casos transversal, retrospectivo cuantitativo y cualitativo.
Se analizaron todos los documentos disponibles sobre las causas y circunstancias de muerte del año 2021 frente a 2014-2023.
Se realizaron tablas de contingencia y riesgo.
En la fase cualitativa, se elaboró una herramienta de análisis del proceso asistencial.
En 2021, se documentó un aumento significativo de muertes por patologías no atribuibles a COVID-19 (tasa años/persona de 296,35 frente a X̄ = 165,53 [p <0,001]).
El riesgo calculado también fue significativo para el periodo (odds ratio[OR] o razón de posibilidades = 2,01; intervalo de confianza [IC]: 1,42-2,83), así como la asociación con el nivel de seguridad de la prisión (p <0,05).
En el 63,4% de las muertes se encontró vinculación a dificultades en el proceso asistencial.
El exceso de mortalidad no COVID-19 en las cárceles de Uruguay en 2021 se debió principalmente a las restricciones a la circulación en prisión y a la prioridad en la atención de pacientes respiratorios, lo que generó dificultades en el acceso a los servicios de salud penitenciarios, retrasos en el diagnóstico y tratamiento de otras patologías.
In December 2019, the first cases of respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus type 2, the causative factor in severe acute respiratory syndrome, appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
The number of cases increased worldwide and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international importance in January 2020.
The situation was full of uncertainties, especially for vulnerable populations such as prison inmates, who ran a higher risk of infection given the characteristics of prisons.
National and international regulations have established standards of protection for human rights and health in prisons, and the consensus is that good healthcare outcomes are achieved when medical activities are based on primary healthcare and actions are managed in accordance whit primary care levels (PCL)1.
However, when faced with the growing number of cases of COVID-19, many countries did not comply with recommendations by the WHO and experts about not focusing exclusively on tracing and treating respiratory patients and contacts, and not abandoning surveillance of other pathologies and maintaining activities within the context of PCL2,3.
Some responses to the pandemic placed greater focus on strengthening second and third healthcare levels, at a time when closing outpatient clinics and health centres was not the most adequate response in view of the above-mentioned recommendations.
Although virtual and telematic healthcare strategies were implemented, these did not satisfactorily replace face-to-face healthcare, creating an overload of work for healthcare personnel and often causing collapses in hospital medical services that were attempting to contain the pandemic4.
The outcome was that health services were reorganised or interrupted, making it difficult to diagnose and treat other pathologies that caused illness and death if diagnosis was delayed5.
Furthermore, many health workers were redirected towards efforts to respond to COVID-19, leading to suspension of activities of health promotion, education and prevention and early diagnosis programmes6-8.
A study by the WHO in 163 countries showed how modifications in the PCL as a result of COVID-19 had affected control of high blood pressure by 52%, diabetes by 49% and cancer by 42%, all as a result of activities such as selective cancellations of services (58%), staff reassigned to respond to COVID-19 (50%) and patients who did not go to medical appointments for fear of infection (50%)9.
Although the first cases of COVID-19 in Uruguay were confirmed in March 2020, the country did not experience any waves of infection that year.
However, March 2021 saw a major increase in positive cases, active cases and deaths over several weeks, making Uruguay the number one country in the number of deaths per million for 68 days10,11.
The public healthcare system, which was already facing a sustained increase in users as a result of the pandemic, established a centralised healthcare strategy with strengthened hospital structures and an extended capacity for beds in intensive care, alongside training and redistribution of human resources to intensive care departments, thus limiting possibilities for building an integrated approach to the pandemic12,13.
This state of affairs led to considerable reductions in consultations at PCL, with a consequent reduction in checkups, diagnoses and treatment of other pathologies, in a country where noncommunicable diseases are the main cause of death14,15.
A survey on health and access to healthcare in Uruguay showed how the health crisis had brought about a change in clinical practice modalities, with a high percentage of studies, procedures, treatments pending or in progress being suspended or postponed16.
The situation provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic was a gloomy one, given the defective conditions and overcrowding common to so many prisons in Uruguay, (e.g. difficuties in isolating contacts, whit the added fear of violence caused by uncertainty about the pandemic).
The United Nations made use of the Nelson Mandela Rules and issued a series of recommendations for managing COVID-19 in prisons, insisting on the idea that the pandemic should not be used as a justification for worsening inmates’ living conditions.
It also suggested that countries should establish plans to reduce overcrowding with a focus on vulnerable inmates (with terminal or chronic diseases or elderly prisoners), and give priority to measures that did not restrict the freedom of inmates with low-risk profiles and responsibilities for caring for others (such as pregnant women and mothers)17.
Latin America and the Caribbean countries have a million and a half prisoners and an imprisonment rate of 120 per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to an average of 24 in other parts of the world.
Uruguay occupies first place in the region and is the tenth country in the world for rates of imprisonment (408 per 100,000 inhabitants).
These figures are constantly growing and gender differences are increasing, with the number of female inmates standing at three times that of men in recent years.
Furthermore, the average level of overcrowding in the prisons of Latin America and the Caribbean countries is 64%, while in Uruguay it stands well above regional averages (129% in 2022)18,19.
Even so, COVID-19 took some time to appear in Uruguayan prisons: the first case in the country was diagnosed in March 2020, but the first case of an infected inmate was not reported until November the same year.
The number of cases in prisons then began to rise sharply, but with a low mortality rate.
In line with general recommendations, the prison authorities established and managed home detention for about twenty cases with particular health risks.
Another measure taken after the first case in prison was to activate a state of alert, applying a flexible, pragmatic policy based on dialogue with inmates and their families and avoiding massive preventive isolation, which would have led to major tensions and confrontations (which did not in fact take place).
The situation was also monitored on a daily basis in collaboration with the health services.
Emphasis was placed on hygiene, temperature controls of infected inmates and suspected cases, isolation areas were defined and activities that brought together more than five persons in an enclosed area were suspended20.
However, the report by the Parliamentary Commission on Prisons described “inadequate healthcare with limited coverage […] pathologies not resolved in time, which has led to violence […] and ‘logjams’ in care causes by the lack of prison officers to go to polyclinics […], with the added difficulties of specifying external coordination for specialised consultations and interventions in community health services”21.
Thus, as with the rest of the community, restrictions in prisons on circulation (exacerbated by security), with the added weakening of the PCL due to the emphasis on screening for respiratory patients, reduced access to clinics, which delayed the diagnoses and treatment of diseases other than COVID-19.
The WHO has prioritised improvements to patient safety in primary healthcare.
One factor it considers to be a high priority issue is diagnostic error, which it feels may be the starting point of a cascade of defects in the healthcare process, alongside the opportunities lost for a correct diagnosis, which may in turn lead to patients being harmed or even dying22.
Graberet al.define it as a “situation in which a patient’s diagnosis is totally omitted, unsuitably delayed and/or mistaken, according to the final information”.
The author identifies three types of diagnostic error: the “innocent” (when the disease is silent or atypical), “systemic” (due to organisational failings) and “cognitive” (linked to perceptions and reasoning in the process of evaluating the disease)23,24.
Singhet al.have included the concept of “lost diagnostic opportunities”, which considers the evolution of the problem presented by a patient during their contract with a healthcare service25.
Patients who seek healthcare and comply (or not) with instructions/appointments; i.e., patient’s behaviour26,27.
When these concepts are applied to healthcare management in prisons, what one finds is that medical personnel provide care to a wide variety of patients with a highly complex set of health issues, work with few diagnostic resources and, in many cases, have little or no knowledge of the inmate’s background, all of which are key factors in making correct medical decisions.
These elements, with the added factor of the organisational characteristics of prisons (where restrictions on circulation for security reasons predominate), may have an effect on timely contact with health services, leading to delays in diagnoses, treatment and premature death28.
To examine the excess deaths caused by non-COVID-19 pathologies amongst inmates of Uruguayan prisons in 2021 compared to 2014-2023, and to analyse the factors that contributed to them.
Non-experimental research on qualitative and quantitative, retrospective, correlational and cross-sectional case studies.
The inclusion criterion was that all the inmates had died from pathologies between 2014 and 2023.
Deaths that occurred during day parole, leave and home detention were excluded.
The data was gathered by the author from public reports by the Parliamentary Commission on Prisons and the Department of Forensic Medicine at the Medical Faculty, along with other information provided by prison institutions.
The gross mortality rates were calculated (given that the age-sex structure and age distribution did not vary significantly over the period that was studied) from the number of deaths in the period and the population exposed to the risk of death at the end of each six-month period.
Frequency tables were used to contrast the averages from 2014 (year from when prison records started to include the category “death from pathology”) with the year in question (2021).
The exposure and outcome variables were tested using the Pearson’s chi-squared test (c2), in which exposure to imprisonment in 2021 and the outcome of death from a pathology are considered.
The odds ratio test was used to calculate the magnitude of the effect.
The circumstances of death from pathology in 2021 were analysed in the qualitative phase, and the variables were grouped into simple tables with qualitative descriptions and categorisations to identify what factors contributed to them.
Associations between the reports from the sources were then established.
A tool was designed to evaluate healthcare monitoring and diagnostic error, based on the classifications proposed by Singhet al.and Graberet al.
The decision was made to add additional components to the classification process of the factors proposed by the first author.
These were: “no medical consultation” (defined as deaths from pathologies that took place in modules and sections without any contact with the health services) and “death with healthcare”, in which death took place with medical monitoring.
The dimensions proposed by Graberet al.were added to the table, which enabled the possible healthcare errors to be subclassified into “innocent” (when death is caused by a silent or undetectable disease), “cognitive-individual causes” and “individual causes”.
Statistical analyses were carried out with the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version22.
The study received institutional support from the prison authorities of Uruguay and complied with the formal research provisions of the Ministry of Public Health.
There was no relationship or link in the study that might lead to possible conflicts of interest.
The total number of deaths registered in prisons in the period 2014-2023 was 490 (191 from pathologies) with gross mortality rates for 2021 that exceeded the average for the period (Figure 1).
Since the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods (2014-2020 and 2022-2023, respectively) were found to be uniform and with continuous distribution that were maintained over time (Levene’s testp= 0.279 and Student’sttest = 0.703 [p= 0.505]), they were unified into one for contrasting with 2021 (Figure 2).
The averages for total deaths and deaths from pathologies in 2021 were, with regard to the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic average, +192% (86 compared to x̄ = 44.77, standard deviation (SD) = 5.04 [CI of 95% ± 3.92]) and +246 %, respectively (41 compared to x̄ = 16.66, SD = 5.29 [CI of 95% ± 3.55]); deaths from COVID-19 represented 9% of the total, with no explanation for the excess mortalities.
The values found in the proportion of deaths in 2021 with regard to the rest of the period were also significant in terms of deaths from all causes (c2= 14.35 [p<0.001]), from pathologies (c2=16.22 [p<0.001]) (Table 1), and for the relative weight of deaths from pathologies over total deaths (2021 = 0.48 compared to x̄ = 0.37, SD = 0.10 [CI of 95% ± 0.08], Student’sttest = -3.707 [p<0.05]).
On the other hand, bearing in mind the sustained increase in inmates (2014 = 9.542; 2023 = 14.950 [+566%]), statistically significant values were calculated and found (p<0.01), when the mean rates of deaths for 2021 were compared with the rest of the period (Table 2).

Calculation of the strength of association between the condition of imprisonment in 2021 and the effect of death was positive for the deaths from all causes (OR = 1.56 [CI of 95%, 1.24- 1.98]) and even more for deaths from pathologies (OR = 2.01 [CI of 95%, 1.42-2.83]).
Significant differences were also found in deaths from pathologies according to the level of security of the unit (Table 3).

As for the qualitative findings, 29% of the deaths occurred amongst persons under 40 years of age, even though the mean age of the deceased persons was 54 years.
92% of the deaths could be classified after analysis of the factors that contributed to them.
63.4% of the deaths were found to have defects in the healthcare process, and 34.1% of those were classified into the “systemic-organisational” category (identified in the stages of non-access to consultations [17%] and disease monitoring [17%]).
29.3% of the deaths (linked to lost diagnostic opportunities [14.6%], inter-consultations [12.2%] and technician/patient meetings [2.4%]) in the “cognitive-individual” category, 29.3% of deaths were linked to missed diagnostic opportunities [14.6%], refferals [12.2%] and technician/patient encounter [2.4%].
Another 29.3% occurred in hospitals due to diagnosed disease with adequate follow-up care.
There was insufficient information available to classify 7.3% of the deaths (Figure 3).
There are few studies on deaths in prisons from non-COVID-19 pathologies.
One study in Florida (USA) on the pandemic showed significant changes in standardised mortality from all causes for inmates (40%) compared to the general public (19%) that were not attributable to COVID-1929.
However, a review of databases on health and COVID-19 and the impact on inmates identified 77 studies, which showed no data about non-COVID-19 healthcare provisions in prisons, or about the quality of care30.
Deaths in prisons over the period of the study showed a significant excess in deaths from all causes and from non-COVID-19 pathologies when they were compared to the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods.
This excess could be explained by factors arising from the pandemic, such as restrictions on circulation and access to PCL (further exacerbated in the prison system).
This opinion has been expressed by some other authors2,3, given that while the first case in the country was reported in March 2020, the first reported case in prison appeared in November of the same year, with a probable impact in 2021 caused by measures being reinforced from that time on5-8.
Both the total deaths and the rates of mortality for 2021 showed significant differences in the number of excess deaths when compared to the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods.
Furthermore, the confined conditions in 2021 represented a higher risk of death from other pathologies; these figures match some taken from other published studies29,30.
The data found on the average age of the persons who died from pathologies match those of publications that described how premature death is related to the higher load of disease and poor care for health amongst inmates, which are aggravated by confinement29.
The qualitative analysis brought to light difficulties in healthcare that could be related with readjustments of the health services to cope with the pandemic, as other studies have shown, where screenings, monitoring and treatment of other non-COVID-19 pathologies were reduced8,9,30.
Failures in different stages of the healthcare process were identified in almost two out of three deaths amongst inmates, probably as a result of the prison and medical models used to cope with the pandemic.
This may have had consequences in healthcare inside prison (access to diagnosis, treatment or control of existing diseases) and outside (coordination and transfers for inter-consultation diagnosis or hospital admission), with a possible worsening and death from other non-COVID-19 pathologies.
This has also been commented in other studies21,30.
One out of three deaths occurred while patients received care from prison or external healthcare services.
Many studies have documented the impact of the pandemic and the medical strategies used to cope with it.
The restrictive measures did not affect everyone equally and some groups such as prison inmates faced greater difficulties.
This study found a significantly large number of excess deaths caused by non-COVID-19 pathologies in Uruguayan prisons in 2021, which coincided with reinforced restrictive measures on circulation and limitations on access to primary care, with consequences at all levels of healthcare.
This process, combined with probable biases in the emphasis towards respiratory syndromes to the detriment of other conditions, may have had an effect in the form of delays or losses of healthcare opportunities for prison inmates, leading to deaths from other pathologies.
