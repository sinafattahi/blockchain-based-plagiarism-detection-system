Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) MRI has been used for in vivo brain imaging to assess lipid and protein composition and benefits from 7 T field strengths due to the larger chemical shift dispersion.
However, a continuing challenge is signal drop off observed in regions such as the medial temporal lobes due to “standing wave” effects from shorter radiofrequency (RF) wavelengths at ultra‐high fields.
2D periodic unit cell metasurfaces have been a promising approach for providing improvements in anatomical imaging but have not yet been evaluated in chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)‐based sequences.
Here, we report the use of metasurfaces for enhancement of NOE imaging as well as for improvement of Lorentzian line fitting of full Z‐spectrum data.
3D NOE image data, B1+maps, and B0maps were acquired on five healthy volunteers using a 7 T MRI system with and without metasurfaces positioned near the temporal lobes.
A frequency offset range of −5 to +5 ppm with additional separate acquisitions of ±20 and ±100 ppm offset images.
A five‐pool Lorentzian line fitting model was employed to fit and quantitatively compared magnetization transfer (MT), amide proton transfer (APT), amine, and relayed NOE (rNOE) metabolite pools.
NOEMTR‐weighted contrast maps were also calculated via Z‐spectrum asymmetry analysis.
The metasurfaces globally enhanced the transmit efficiency within the imaging slab by approximately 9.6% and reduced B1+inhomogeneity by approximately 16.6% and increased transmit efficiency by 55.8% in the temporal lobes.
Amplitude fit maps showed decreases in contrast magnitude ranging from 1 to 16% and changes in image uniformity ranging from a 4.3 decrease to a 34.7% increase, while NOEMTR‐weighted contrast maps demonstrated similar changes.
The results presented here demonstrate that metasurfaces can enhance CEST‐based techniques complementing previously reported benefits in anatomical imaging.
Metasurfaces were utilized to improve in vivo brain B1+inhomogeneity at 7 T and enhance NOE imaging and multipool Z‐spectra fitting.
Results showed that B1+magnitude was increased global and locally within the temporal lobes while NOE image enhancement was also observed in the temporal lobes.
Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) MRI is a promising technique for assessing lipid and protein content within the brain by leveraging dipolar cross relaxation between saturated and unsaturated spins systems and producing endogenous contrast [1,2,3].
By repeating this measurement across a range of frequency offsets, a voxel‐based Z‐spectrum can be generated which includes signal contributions from the exchange of various functional groups such as aliphatic, amine, and amide protons (APT).
Additionally, the saturation of free (direct saturation) and restricted (magnetization transfer) water molecules also contributes substantially to the overall signal.
These additional contributions from direct saturation and magnetization transfer effects can make quantification of smaller pools, such as amine, APT, and relayed NOE (rNOE) less accurate when using asymmetry analysis.
Multi‐pool Lorentzian line fitting models have been employed in the past to separate out these contributing signals, leaving the previously mentioned metabolite pools for individual assessment in both healthy and diseased populations [4,5,6].
Furthermore, NOE magnetization transfer ratio (NOEMTR) provides an additional derived contrast from this imaging technique that combines the aggregate effect from direct saturation and magnetization transfer, which has been applied to imaging of high‐grade brain tumors, ischemic stroke injury [7], Parkinson's disease [8], and Alzheimer's disease [9,10].
The application of in vivo full Z‐spectrum acquisition at ultra‐high field (≥7 T) strengths allows for substantial increases in SNR and spatial resolution as well as increasing chemical shift displacement, making it exceptionally useful in chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) based techniques, such as NOE [11].
However, a continuing challenge at these field strengths is the reduced transmit (B1+) field homogeneity, leading to signal degradation [12,13].
In neuroimaging applications where there is a strong relation between the signal and B1+field strength, such as for NOE imaging, the temporal lobes typically show a large amount of signal drop off.
Current mitigation strategies for dealing with B1+inhomogeneity have included the use of CEST specific post‐processing corrections [5,14] as well as parallel transmit (pTx) techniques [15,16].
However, post‐processing corrections can be unreliable in anatomical regions below a certain B1+threshold while specific absorption rate (SAR) restrictions for pTx hardware can limit use beyond the research space.
Dielectric pads have long been an effective technique for improving not only SNR in anatomical images [17,18,19] but also contrast uniformity in CEST‐based techniques [20].
Previous work by our group showed that dielectric padding, in combination with standard linear post‐processing correction, help mitigate B1+inhomogeneity issues leading to improved NOEMTRcontrast values in the brain at 7 T [21].
However, dielectric pads come with several drawbacks including a limited shelf life (12–18 months), limited corrective efficacy due to the permittivity limits of available materials, and bulky size that hinders placement inside the already space constrained 7 T radiofrequency (RF) coils.
Metasurfaces and metamaterials provide an alternative means for improving B1+homogeneity.
They function similarly to dielectric pads by supporting induced RF currents in the 2D or 3D periodic unit cell structures which generate a secondary RF field that can enhance the B1+field in regions of drop off [22,23].
Notable in vivo applications of this class of device at 1.5 T and 3 T include anatomical imaging of the wrist [24,25], knee [26], calf [27], and abdomen [28].
Additionally, metasurfaces for 7 T applications have also seen increased utilization including brain imaging [29,30], spectroscopy [31], and, recently by our group, in calf imaging [32].
However, neither metasurfaces nor metamaterials have been assessed in the context of CEST‐based techniques, including NOE imaging.
In the present work we utilize a previously demonstrated metasurface design to assess the corrective effects of the metasurface on B1+inhomogeneities, NOEMTR, and multi‐pool metabolite fitting derived contrasts not only on the entire imaging slab but also locally in the temporal lobes.
Metasurfaces produce a secondary B1+field via the induction of induced currents in the conductive structure.
The induced voltage potential (VMS) across the unit cell of an inductive mesh grid filter design, seen in Equation1, can be described by integrating the incident transmit field (B→1,RF+) along the unit cell conductor trace path (l→).
As seen in Equation2, the resulting secondary field formed from the metasurface (B→1,MS+) is proportional to the induced current (iMS) in the conductor trace which is also dependent on the ratio ofVMStto the unit cell complex impedance (ZMS).
However, unlike secondary B1+fields formed via high‐permittivity dielectric padding (from displacement currents), which add constructively to the primary field, conduction currents formed in metasurface structures are 90° out of phase.
Without any form of additional phase delay, the resulting fields would add orthogonally withB→1,RF+, resulting in a suboptimal change.
The phase of these conduction currents can be influenced either by varying the length of the conductor traces to a specific wavelength fraction [33,34] or by changing the characteristic reactance of the unit cell [28,30].
For the latter approach, the unit cell impedance can be described as a series RLC‐circuit with a small non‐zero resistance (R) and a certain amount of inductive or capacitive reactance (X), as seen in Equation3.
As a unit cell will have a natural amount of inductance associated with the conductor traces (XL>0), a series capacitance (C) can bring the total reactance of the unit cell to zero or even made to be capacitive (XC<0), as seen in Equation4, wherefis the operating frequency of the system.
The phase angle (φ) can be determined by taking the arctangent of the ratio between the imaginary and real components of the complex impedance, as seen in Equation5, reflecting the ideal relationship between added series capacitance and phase ofiMS.
Conversely, describing the alternate inductive regime would be seen in Equation6.
This interaction mechanism can be seen illustrated in Figure1.
A diagram illustrating the interaction mechanism between the transmit field (B→1,RF+) and an individual unit cell.
TheB→1,RF+induces currents (iMS) in the conductor trace length (l→) which induces a voltage potential (VMSt) across the unit cell.VMStthen induces additional currents (iMS) which then form a secondary magnetic field (B→1,MS+t), brought into phase with the primary field by controlling the characteristic impedance (ZMS) of the unit cell.
A pair of in‐house designed 18 × 18 cm2metasurfaces, illustrated in Figure2a, were manufactured on a 25‐μm‐thick flexible polyimide printed circuit board (PCB) substrate, with a uniform unit cell size of 11.25 mm.
A series capacitance of 11 pF was integrated into each side of the unit cell via parallel plates of approximately 3 × 3 mm2.
The metasurfaces used in this work were identical to the metasurfaces used in a previous study by our group [32].

The corresponding coronal FLAIR image can be seen from the approximate center of the slab location with metasurface placement annotated by the labelled orange lines near the temporal lobes (c).
All images were acquired on a 7 T system (MAGNETOM Terra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a single‐channel transmit and 32‐channel receive phased array proton RF coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA).
Images were acquired on 5 healthy volunteers (3 males, 2 females; average age = 30 ± 5.95 years) after obtaining informed written consent under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.
Based on prior phantom safety assessments [32], all acquisitions were run under a conservative SAR limit of 50% (normal mode operation) to mitigate risks of adverse heating events.
A modified volumetric (3D) turbo FLASH sequence with gradient echo readout, was used in acquiring CEST image data having a TR = 3.9 ms, TE = 1.79 ms, shot TR = 6 s, with 3 shots per image [11].
The volumetric slab was positioned on the medial temporal lobes in a coronal orientation (Figure2b) and acquired first with and then without the metasurfaces present on either side of the head (Figure2c).
The acquisition comprised 12 slices each with a 2 mm thickness, for a total 24‐mm‐thick slab with an in‐plane resolution of 1 × 1 mm2and a matrix size of 240 × 196.
A B1,RMSwith an amplitude of 0.72 μT was used in achieving magnetization preparation, with a saturation duration of 3 s. Specifically, thirty 99‐ms‐long Hanning‐shaped pulses with a 1 ms inter‐pulse delay were applied at frequency offsets ranging from −5 to 5 ppm in step sizes of 0.2 ppm relative to the water proton resonance.
The range of frequency offsets were used to generate in vivo Z‐spectra which were then used in a multi‐pool Lorentzian line fitting model.
Additional saturation offsets were also acquired at ±20 and ±100 ppm to aid in Lorentzian fitting, with the 100 ppm saturation offset also being used for NOEMTRnormalization calculations.
B1+maps were acquired as described by Volz et al. [35] under the following parameters: nonselective preparation pulses were used to collect images at three flip angles (20°, 40°, and 80°) across the same 12‐slice slab each with a slice thickness of 2 mm, with an in‐plane resolution of 1 × 1 mm2, and a matrix size of 240 × 196.
TR = 3.50 ms, TE = 1.46 ms, shot TR = 7400 ms, and number of shots = 5.
These B1+maps were then converted to transmit efficiency maps by normalizing to the transmit reference voltage.
Water saturation shift referencing (WASSR) images [36] were also acquired at frequency offsets ranging from −1 to +1 ppm, in steps of 0.1 ppm, with the saturation pulse having a B1,rms= 0.29 μT and a saturation duration of 200 ms for B0field inhomogeneity correction.
Prior to post‐processing, the first and last slices in the imaging slab were discarded due to aliasing artifacts.
A pixel‐by‐pixel five‐pool Lorentzian line fitting model was used to fit each in‐vivo Z‐spectrum to five pools: direct saturation (DS), magnetization transfer (MT), amide proton transfer (APT), amine, and relayed NOE (rNOE) [5].
Fitting boundaries and initial values used for each pool can be seen in TableS1.
The fitting model was parallelized and utilized the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to decrease fitting computation time.
Additionally, for the fitting‐based analysis, the CEST‐based imaging data was denoised prior to multipool fitting via a 4‐dimensional Bloch Matching (BM4D) Filter [37].
NOEMTRwas calculated by subtracting the −3.5 ppm offset image from the −100 ppm offset image (𝑆0) and normalizing the difference to 𝑆0, as described below in Equation7.
An additional linear B1+post‐processing correction step was applied to all image data after WASSR images were used to correct for B0inhomogeneity via local interpolation to a second‐order polynomial [5].
To assess changes in specific tissue contrast, gray and white matter segmentations were generated via T1maps [38].
These tissue types were then analyzed separately as masks to each of the quantities presented.
Mean and standard deviation values were calculated for different quantities across the volumetric slab for whole brain, white matter, and gray matter tissue types as well as a circular temporal lobe ROI on either side of the brain slab.
All analyses and imaging processing were performed using in house MATLAB (The MathWorks) analysis which incorporated statistical parametric mapping 12 (SPM12) [39].
Figure3shows coronal transmit efficiency maps acquired with and without the metasurfaces as well as a percent change map for the five participants.
The transmit efficiency maps consistently showed qualitative enhancement in the temporal lobes when the metasurfaces were used in comparison to the reference condition.
The mean whole slab transmit efficiency was 0.052 ± 0.012 μT/V in the reference condition and 0.057 ± 0.010 μT/V with the metasurfaces, reflecting a 9.6% increase in mean value and 16.6% decrease in the variability.
Transmit efficiency mainly increased in the temporal lobes where the average reference value was 0.034 ± 0.003 μT/V and the average metasurface value was 0.053 ± 0.002 μT/V, reflecting a 55.8% increase with a 33% decrease in variability.
In some areas of the temporal lobes the transmit efficiency increased upwards of 100%.
This data is also quantified and summarized for each individual subject as seen in Table1.
The improved B1+uniformity is also reflected in a histogram showing the distribution of transmit efficiencies across voxels with and without metasurfaces (Figure4).
The transmit efficiency histogram narrows substantially and increases to a higher magnitude with metasurfaces compared to the reference condition.
ΔB0maps were also acquired under reference and metasurface conditions, showing that minimal off‐resonance effects are produced in the imaging volume from the introduction of the metasurfaces (Figure5).
Transmit efficiency maps acquired across all five subjects showing the distribution in both the reference (top row) and metasurface (middle row) experimental conditions.
Percent difference maps (bottom row) show that substantial increases of up to 100% are produced in the temporal lobes while slight decreases are seen in the central and superior regions contributing to an overall increase in B1+homogeneity.

Data from all 10 slices across all subjects were combined and in the case of the temporal ROIs, data from both temporal lobes were combined.
For the whole brain case, the mean transmit efficiency in the reference case was 0.052 ± 0.012μT/V while the metasurface case was 0.057 ± 0.010μT/V.
For the temporal lobe case, the mean transmit efficiency in the reference case was 0.034 ± 0.003μT/V while the metasurface case was 0.053 ± 0.002 μT/V.

Figure6shows the resulting MT, APT, amine, and rNOE fitting amplitude maps from two representative subjects under both reference and metasurface conditions.
Overall qualitative signal increases can be seen in the temporal lobes for the MT pool, illustrating a more uniform contrast across the image.
The mean whole slab MT amplitude across subjects was 0.232 ± 0.089 in the reference condition and 0.222 ± 0.075 with metasurfaces.
Similar changes were observed for segmented brain tissue values which changed from 0.294 ± 0.077 in the reference condition to 0.274 ± 0.055 with metasurfaces in white matter as well as from 0.194 ± 0.063 in reference to 0.196 ± 0.053 in gray matter.
Temporal lobe MT amplitude quantification also showed a substantial increase in magnitude from 0.130 ± 0.068 in the reference case to 0.196 ± 0.060 in the metasurface case.
APT, amine, and rNOE, showed increases in contrast uniformity manifested as reductions in amplitude map oversaturation.
The whole slab mean APT amplitude across subjects was 0.025 ± 0.023 for the reference condition and 0.021 ± 0.015 with metasurfaces.
No changes were observed in the white matter APT amplitudes while gray matter changed from 0.025 ± 0.016 in the reference condition to 0.021 ± 0.013 with metasurfaces.
Temporal lobe APT amplitude quantification also increased in magnitude from 0.026 ± 0.017 in the reference case to 0.029 ± 0.014 in the metasurface case.
The mean whole slab amine amplitude across subjects was 0.033 ± 0.019 for the reference condition and 0.029 ± 0.019 with metasurfaces.
Similar changes were observed for segmented tissue which changed from 0.026 ± 0.013 in reference to 0.022 ± 0.017 with metasurfaces in white matter from 0.035 ± 0.018 in reference to 0.032 ± 0.017 in gray matter.
Temporal lobe amine amplitude quantification also increased in magnitude from 0.027 ± 0.019 in the reference case to 0.032 ± 0.017 in the metasurface case.
The mean whole slab rNOE amplitude across subjects was 0.091 ± 0.023 for the reference and 0.090 ± 0.024 with metasurfaces.
Minor quantified changes were also observed for segmented tissue, changed from 0.101 ± 0.017 in reference to 0.100 ± 0.018 with metasurfaces in white matter and from 0.088 ± 0.021 in reference to 0.087 ± 0.020 in gray matter.
The temporal lobe quantification showed an increase in rNOE amplitude from 0.083 ± 0.019 for the reference to 0.095 ± 0.018 for the metasurface.
These data are quantified and summarized for each individual subject in TablesS2andS3.
RMSE values were measured for each subject and showed an improvement from an average of 0.011 in the reference case to 0.008 in the metasurface case.
Individual subject wise RMSE values can be seen in the supplemental TableS4.
Additionally, example Z‐spectra showing spectra ranges of ±100 ppm and ±5 ppm averaged within two separate ROIs in the brain can be found as supplemental FigureS1.

Figure7shows a comparison of the NOEMTR‐weighted contrast values across all five subjects between the reference and metasurface conditions, demonstrating repeatability.
The mean whole slab NOEMTRcontrast value across subjects was 38.99 ± 11.89% for the reference and 40.58 ± 11.95% with metasurfaces.
Similar changes were observed for segmented tissue, which changed from 46.52 ± 7.75% in reference to 48.40 ± 7.40% with metasurfaces in white matter and from 36.54 ± 8.68% in reference to 37.98 ± 8.43% with metasurfaces in gray matter.
NOEMTRvalues quantified in the temporal lobe ROI increased from 38.46 ± 8.94% for the reference to 42.03 ± 8.65% for the metasurface.
This data is quantified and summarized for each individual subject in TableS5.

The slice presented is from the center of the volumetric slab.
Improvements in contrast uniformity are further supported by histogram comparisons in Figure8, showing contrast histograms of the reference condition and metasurfaces.
MT amplitude values show consistent histogram narrowing across the whole brain as well as within white matter and gray matter with the metasurfaces compared to the reference condition.
APT, amine, and rNOE amplitude values were shifted to slightly lower mean values reflecting a decrease in image contrast over saturation and increase in image uniformity.
Lastly, NOEMTRcontrast value distributions were shifted to higher overall magnitude while the contrast variability was decreased.
This data is further quantified across tissue type and for each pool and summarized as supplemental FigureS2.

Distributions can be seen for each of the metabolite fit (MT, APT, amine, and rNOE) amplitudes and NOEMTRcontrast separated into whole brain, white matter, and gray matter can be seen in the left, center, and right columns, respectively.
Metasurfaces increased the mean transmit efficiency values across subjects and decreased the B1+variability without introducing any unwanted off‐resonance effects.
This was particularly evident when assessing the temporal lobe ROI which alone saw a 55.8% increase in B1+magnitude.
The improvements in transmit efficiency values were partially driven by lower transmit reference voltages needed for the metasurfaces to produce the same effective B1+field in comparison to the reference condition [23].
The other mechanism for transmit efficiency improvement comes from the additional secondary field induced via conduction currents that can sum with the primary currents.
This was seen not only as a substantial increase in the temporal lobe regions but also as a slight decrease in the central and superior brain regions.
Resulting qualitative contrasts improvements were seen in both the fit amplitude maps and in the NOEMTRderived contrast maps, particularly in the lateral temporal lobes where the largest amount of signal drop off typically occurs.
We were also able to establish intrasubject repeatability by consistently showing the in vivo enhancing effects across five subjects.
In previous work by our group, we showed that a set of conventional calcium titanate dielectric pads [19], in combination with a post‐processing linear B1+correction, could provide more enhancement for NOEMTRimaging than dielectric pads alone [21].
When using the metasurfaces, we opted to incorporate the same multi‐faceted correction approach using linear B1+correction for all image data.
The metasurfaces enhanced the B1+field in regions of low magnitude, particularly in the lateral temporal lobes, increasing the overall effective B1+distribution above a certain minimum threshold (~0.03μT/V) and into a regime that is more suited for linear correction, as linear correction is not suitable for wider ranges of B1+magnitude [40].
In the case of the multipool Lorentzian fitting, the general model parameters used are more stable above a minimum B1+threshold.
When fitting the Z‐spectrum, data in regions where the B1+is below this threshold, the model will attempt to overestimate the fit in certain pools and will appear nonuniform in the resulting contrast maps.
By increasing both the magnitude and homogeneity of the B1+field, the resulting amplitude maps appear more uniform in image contrast.
It should be noted that differences in MT and rNOE contrasts can be explained due to rNOE being a smaller fit peak compared to the MT peak as well as rNOE being more associated with mobile macromolecules likely associated with unsaturated fatty acids in the myelin membrane and neuronal cell body plasma membrane lipids.
Additionally, the APT signal in white matter appears to be lower than in grey matter due to both the overall lower concentration of proteins in the white matter and white matter proteins being significantly less mobile than those in the grey matter.
The metasurfaces described here utilized an inductive mesh on a flexible PCB substrate which incorporated 11 pF of added capacitance to tune the response of the metasurfaces.
With the relative simplicity of the design, involving only a single capacitance value, these metasurfaces could be optimized in a straightforward manner.
However, because our design is based on parallel plate capacitances, this may involve increases in substrate losses, in comparison to designs that use conductor traces corresponding to a specific RF wavelength fraction [25,34,41].
These additional losses may negatively affect the overall transmit efficiency and, by reciprocity, result in an increased amount of noise present in the images.
Furthermore, if placed improperly these metasurfaces can also produce regions of decreased image contrast due to potential reductions in the B1+field strength.
Varying the amount of capacitance across the metasurface to induce position‐based changes in unit cell reactance may be able to compensate for this [42].
Limitations present in this work include the acquisition only encompassing a relatively small 20 mm thick slab, precluding the assessment of whole brain NOE enhancements.
Additionally, due to the conservative 50% SAR constraint, sequences utilizing high SAR levels (higher B1+powers), such as glutamate‐weighted CEST (GluCEST), could not be assessed with the metasurfaces at present.
However, since dielectric pads have been shown to be effective at enhancing GluCEST contrast [20], and the metasurfaces function similarly to dielectric pads, it would be expected that they would provide a similar (if not higher) level of GluCEST contrast enhancement.
This also holds true for CEST based contrasts using lower powers, such as hydroxyl‐CEST.
Additional RF safety assessments including phantom temperature measurements and electromagnetic simulations in heterogenous body models are therefore warranted to reduce the safety margin for such techniques.
Additionally, since metasurfaces are manually placed near the subject's head, small variations between left and right temporal lobe enhancement may be present.
Future studies using this metasurface design and modified versions include homogenizing the B1+field for creatine‐weighted CEST (CrCEST) in the calf at 7 T as well as designing a version that fully encapsulates the head, which is expected to allow further B1+homogeneity gains.
We demonstrated the first use of flexible metasurfaces for enhancing in vivo CEST‐based brain contrast at 7 T in the form of NOEMTRcontrast and multipool Lorentzian fitting.
Transmit efficiency maps showed an increase in both medial temporal lobe B1+magnitude (55.8% increase) and overall, across the imaging slab (9.6% increase) without the introduction of off‐resonance effects.
Use of the metasurfaces yielded benefits in the NOEMTRcontrast maps by increasing medial temporal lobe signal and in the multipool amplitude maps (MT, APT, amine, and rNOE) by reducing image saturation and model overfitting.
Overall, this work has shown that metasurfaces not only improve anatomical based structural imaging but also CEST‐based techniques at low RF powers.
