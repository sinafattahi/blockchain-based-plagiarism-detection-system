High‐impact infectious diseases pose major global health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for robust public health preparedness.
Despite efforts to improve global health security, recent pandemics have revealed significant weaknesses in health systems’ preparedness and response capabilities.
We reviewed and synthesized key strategies and lessons from existing public health preparedness plans for high‐impact infectious diseases.
This included examining national and global plans, focusing on strategic approaches, evidence integration, and real‐world implementation lessons.
A narrative synthesis, based on the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) model, identified effective practices and areas needing improvement.
We screened 1987 documents, selecting 38 for detailed analysis.
Findings highlighted strategies for long‐term health emergency preparedness, workforce development, enhancing global health frameworks, and investing in infrastructure.
Challenges included maintaining laboratory detection, managing sentinel surveillance, and logistical issues.
Effective approaches emphasized early threat detection, rapid response, healthcare capacity, medical supply management, and strategic communication.
Effective public health preparedness for high‐impact infectious diseases requires a coordinated approach, including early threat detection, rapid response, robust healthcare systems, and strategic communication.
Past outbreaks show the need for continuous investment, evidence‐based policies, and adaptable health systems.
Future research should assess ongoing preparedness efforts and implementation challenges.
High‐impact infectious diseases have consistently posed significant health challenges globally, resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality.
Since the dawn of the twenty‐first century, the world has witnessed several severe infectious disease outbreaks, beginning with the SARS coronavirus pandemic in 2002–2003.
This pandemic highlighted the need for the robust international frameworks for pandemic preparedness to manage such health crises [1].
In response to the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) significantly revised its International Health Regulations (IHR) in 2005.
This revision aimed to provide a more effective global legal framework to respond to acute public health risks that could potentially cross borders and threaten people worldwide.
A key feature of the revised regulations was the introduction of the mechanism for declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), designed to bring a coordinated international response to such crises [2].
Since the amendment of these regulations, the WHO has declared PHEICs on several occasions: the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic in 2009; Ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2014) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018); the resurgence of polio in 2014; the Zika virus outbreak in 2015; the COVID‐19 pandemic beginning in 2020 and the Mpox outbreaks in 2022 and 2024.
These health emergencies presented unique challenges and necessitated globally coordinated responses to mitigate their impacts [2].
The COVID‐19 pandemic, in particular, has underscored the devastating consequences of such diseases, not only on global health but also on society and the worldwide economy.
It has highlighted the interconnectedness of countries and economies and the importance of global solidarity in responding to public health threats.
The pandemic has led to unprecedented public health measures, including international travel restrictions, nationwide lockdowns, and massive vaccination campaigns, illustrating the critical role of international cooperation and preparedness in combating global health emergencies.
The recent outbreaks, culminating in the COVID‐19 pandemic, have, however, exposed significant gaps in public health systems’ preparedness to manage and contain infectious diseases.
The pandemic revealed that many health systems were overwhelmed and lacked the infrastructure and protocols to respond effectively to such widespread health crises [3].
According to the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, critical elements of successful public health interventions against COVID‐19 have included prompt case identification and contact tracing, establishment of dedicated isolation facilities, fostering partnerships within government sectors and with external entities, maintaining clear and transparent communication, and actively engaging communities and the private sector.
These components underscore the necessity for comprehensive planning, collaboration, and transparent strategies in strengthening public health responses to future infectious disease outbreaks [4].
The panel identifies several areas for improvement in public health responses in some countries, noting the depreciation of scientific evidence evolved and the pandemic's potential impact, procrastination in initiating measures, inadequately funded health systems, and poor coordination between national and local responses.
A significant shortcoming was the failure of leadership in some countries to assume responsibility and implement strategies to limit community transmission effectively.
These factors contributed to less effective management and control of the pandemic, underscoring the critical need for timely action, adequate funding, cohesive strategy, and accountable leadership in future public health crises [4].
Well‐coordinated, evidence‐based strategic planning, implemented by national authorities across jurisdictions, could have significantly enhanced pandemic responses in numerous countries.
Jurisdictional scans are strategic instruments employed by governments for informed decision‐making.
They entail an in‐depth analysis of various jurisdictions’ definitions, approaches, and strategies regarding specific issues.
This process enables policymakers to identify, compare, and gauge the relevance of distinct policies and helps provide crucial insights for policy formulation.
Moreover, jurisdictional scans may help identify practical considerations critical for implementing policies, leveraging insights from various regions’ experiences [5].
This jurisdictional scan aims to review and synthesize key strategies and lessons from existing public health preparedness plans, specifically targeting high‐impact infectious disease threats.
The objectives of the study are as follows: To review existing public health preparedness plans at both national and global levels, focusing specifically on high‐impact infectious disease threats.
The aim is to distill key strategies, best practices, and lessons learned from various national and global responses to high‐impact infectious disease threats to public health.
To synthesize the key strategies used in these plans in the face of high‐impact infectious disease outbreaks following the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) model.
This involves understanding the systems and processes used in different jurisdictions.
To describe how evidence support is integrated into these preparedness plans.
This includes assessing the use of evidence in formulating and implementing the plans or strategies and the mechanism for timely demand‐driven evidence support across all eight forms of evidence in decision‐making as identified by the Global Evidence Commission Report [6], that is, data analytics, modeling, evaluation, behavioral/implementation research, qualitative insights, evidence synthesis, technology assessment/cost‐effectiveness analysis, and guidelines.
To identify and extract lessons learned and best practices from these plans, especially those tested in real‐world scenarios.
This will include analyzing successes and challenges faced during high‐impact infectious disease crises.
The jurisdictional scope of this review encompasses a dual focus, examining both national and global perspectives.
National: This aspect of the review focused on examining the public health preparedness approaches used by individual countries.
It examined how different nations have responded to and managed public health crises, especially those related to high‐impact infectious diseases.
We selected countries based on their similarity to Ireland in terms of geographical profile, population size, and organization of health services.
We also considered the magnitude of public health challenges, uniqueness of response strategies, and outcomes.
Selected countries are as follows:New Zealand: Similar island geography, effective COVID‐19 response strategy.Portugal: Public healthcare similar to Ireland.Denmark: Similar healthcare system, effective in managing public health challenges.Finland: Comparable in terms of population and healthcare organization, known for its strong public health infrastructure.Norway: Similarities in the public health system, proactive in health crisis management.Iceland: Island nation with a population size smaller than Ireland, but with an effective public health response system.Luxembourg: Small population, high‐quality healthcare system faced unique challenges during the pandemic.Singapore: Similar population and island geography, highly organized healthcare system, and innovative public health strategies, particularly during the COVID‐19 pandemic.Israel: Different in size and geographical profile but highly organized healthcare system, innovative use of technology in public health, and notable response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, especially in terms of rapid vaccination rollout and data‐driven strategies.Canada: Although larger in both geography and population, Canada's healthcare system, which is publicly funded and administered on a provincial level, has parallels with Ireland's system.
Canada's diverse population and its response to public health crises, including its strategies for managing the COVID‐19 pandemic across different provinces, provide a useful comparison for Ireland.UK: We considered the United Kingdom as a whole, as well as England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland separately.Global: Any international report on country‐level preparedness such as the Evidence Commission Report, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) report, the WHO report, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, and so forth.
These reports were used to understand and compare national responses to public health crises as evaluated and presented by multilateral organizations rather than how multilateral organizations respond.
Data sources: Primary sources included government websites, including ministry of health websites, reports from international health organizations (such as WHO, CDC, ECDC, PAHO, and OECD, Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, Policy Commons), and documents from national commissions and multilateral organizations.
Key online repositories for these organizations were systematically searched.
Search strategy: A targeted search strategy was developed, focusing on combinations of keywords like “public health emergencies,” “preparedness,” “crisis management,” “emergency response,” “evidence‐based policy,” “infectious disease response,” and specific names of diseases or threats.
This strategy was adapted to each specific source, including its interface for searching, to maximize the relevance and comprehensiveness of the search results.
The details of the search strategies have been provided in theSupporting Informationsection.
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: Types of documents: The review included documents or reports of national advisory groups, review committees, assessment of high‐level panels, national commissions, policy groups, monitoring boards, and reports of science task forces or academia.
It also encompassed governmental policies, strategic plans, action reports, and guidelines that detail best practices in managing public health emergencies, particularly those related to high‐impact infectious diseases.
Health threats: The primary focus was on infectious diseases with actual or potential high impact.
These include diseases with widespread infection rates and significant mortality, those causing considerable economic and social disruption, and rapid transmission rates leading to national, regional, or global outbreaks, including defined high‐consequence infectious diseases [7].
Diseases declared global health emergencies by major organizations like ECDC and the WHO received substantial media and public attention or necessitated significant government and policy responses.
Time frame: Documents that focus on infectious diseases, relevance to public health preparedness, and publication since 2020.
Exclusion criteria include documents not directly related to national or global preparedness strategies or those not providing actionable insights or evaluations.
Document assessment: Each document underwent a preliminary assessment to determine its relevance to the review's objectives.
This involved evaluating the content for direct insights into public health preparedness strategies for high‐impact infectious disease threats.
Two independent review authors selected the documents through the full‐text review, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.
Key information was extracted from each selected document, including the nature of the public health strategy, measures of success or challenges, and evidence integration in the preparedness plans.
We extracted data and synthesized it following the PHEP model [8,9] and organized it by each objective.
The PHEP framework was designed to assist EU member states in identifying areas where readiness planning is insufficient.
The logic model focuses on three interconnected components: capacities, response capabilities, and objectives.
In this model, “response capabilities,” also referred to as “Public Health Preparedness Capabilities” are categorized into “detection and assessment,” “policy development, adaptation and implementation,” “health services,” “coordination and communication,” and “emergency risk communication” [9].
This approach can be broadly applied to categorize different facets of preparedness for various pandemic health threats.
Data extraction was performed by one review author and was cross‐checked by a second review author.
Comparative analysis: The extracted data were analyzed to compare and contrast different public health preparedness strategies.
This analysis identified common themes, successful approaches, and areas of challenge across different national contexts.
Evidence integration assessment: The use of evidence in formulating and implementing these strategies/decisions was assessed, including how various forms of evidence (data analytics, modeling, qualitative insights, etc.) are integrated.
Synthesis of lessons learned: On the basis of the analysis, key strategies and lessons learned were identified to help highlight effective practices and areas where improvements are needed, particularly in the face of high‐impact infectious disease outbreaks.
We identified a total of 1987 documents, of which 105 were included in the full‐text review (Figure1).

Echoing our findings, this review highlighted a strong alignment with the components of the All‐Hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP [49,50], which advocates for a comprehensive and adaptable approach to emergency planning.
This framework underscores the importance of resilience across various health system capacities to enable effective response and recovery during emergencies.
The scoping review pinpointed several key themes essential for reinforcing emergency preparedness actions: Evidence‐based decision‐making: utilizing the best available data to guide actions and policy formulation.
Vaccination capacity: expanding as a primary defense mechanism against infectious disease outbreaks.
Diagnostic capabilities: enhancing the overall laboratory system for timely and accurate identification of pathogens.
IPC: emphasizing measures to prevent disease spread within healthcare settings and the broader community.
Healthcare infrastructure: increasing investment to form the backbone of any robust emergency response.
Legislation support: enabling swift and effective emergency responses and public health measures.
These themes form a blueprint for enhancing PHEP, ensuring that systems are in place to mitigate the impact of infectious disease emergencies.
Another recent report [51] from the HIQA, Ireland, guided the Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group by evaluating the functionality and structure of public health systems in selected countries, particularly in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic.
The report benchmarks these systems against the WHO's 12 Essential Public Health Functions (EPHFs), revealing a balance between strategic national oversight and decentralized implementation.
Notably, functions such as surveillance and governance are predominantly nationally coordinated, whereas emergency management and health promotion are largely executed at regional and local levels.
Key observations from the pandemic response underline the indispensability of: Robust IT infrastructure: for data gathering and surveillance.
Evidence synthesis: in shaping policy.
Decentralized models: fostering local engagement but with limitations in achieving a cohesive national response.
Holistic approach: merging health protection with health promotion, intelligence, and service improvement to mitigate health disparities.
These insights advocate for the strategic orchestration of EPHFs across different governance layers, highlighting the significance of readiness and flexibility within the public health framework.
These findings also align with the identified public health preparedness strategies highlighted in our jurisdictional scan.
To make informed decisions about public health and social measures (PHSMs), it is essential to use the best available evidence, even though these measures are challenging to evaluate in controlled settings.
Real‐world studies, despite their complexity and potential biases, provide valuable insights [52].
We did not rule out economic and social responses; however, we did not obtain specific information on those aspects in this jurisdictional scan.
The PHEP model provides a systematic framework for enhancing pandemic response strategies across countries and regions.
By establishing national standards for preparedness planning, the model enables jurisdictions to assess and strengthen their response capabilities to public health emergencies.
Adopting the PHEP model allows regions to build resilience, improve preparedness, and ensure a more effective and coordinated response to future pandemics.
Our objective was to analyze the pandemic response strategies of selected countries, including New Zealand, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Singapore, Israel, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
However, we could only obtain reports specific to New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, and South Korea, with the remaining analyses being of a global or regional nature.
A possible explanation is the prevalence of documents in local languages on the health ministries’ websites of these countries, which may have limited our access to reports detailing national strategies for pandemic or emergency preparedness.
Although these documents incorporate various types of evidence in their methodologies, they do not elaborate on how this evidence was explicitly used in formulating their preparedness and response plans.
Our aim was to understand the application of evidence in national pandemic preparedness plans, but specific details on this aspect were not discernible from the available information.
We could not determine if individual countries employ a single agency or multiple entities to devise strategies against emerging health threats, a factor critical for enhancing future preparedness for health crises, such as infectious diseases and pandemics.
However, insights from Scotland revealed that centralized planning, managed by a specific public health agency or health board, can enable a more synchronized response effort.
In Canada, efforts at central coordination gradually decreased over time.
The main challenges stem from the implementation of current preparedness plans and policies.
Increased health investment and an evidence‐based approach to policymaking can markedly improve preparedness and responses to future infectious diseases.
Urgent and decisive actions by governments and public health authorities are essential, highlighted by the rapid progression of the COVID‐19 pandemic.
Combatting misinformation, intensified during the pandemic, is equally critical.
The simultaneous spread of misinformation, disinformation, or “infodemic,” alongside the health crisis, necessitates that global and national health organizations counteract misinformation effectively by validating sources and guiding the public to reliable information.
In Ireland, a fact‐checking initiative has played a key role in refuting nonscientific claims, providing evidence‐based rebuttals, and thus reinforcing public trust and comprehension of health guidelines [53,54].
The intra‐action review of the health protection response in Ireland gathered insights from Health Service Executive Health Protection staff on the pandemic response, leading to key recommendations in communication, governance, and staff well‐being.
Effective communication should be timely, clear, relevant, and trustworthy to guide decisions and influence behavior.
Quality governance involves structures and standards to ensure safe and effective services.
A positive organizational culture, marked by trust and alignment of values, is crucial for success [55].
Our research examined preparedness for public health emergencies driven by emerging or reemerging infectious disease threats.
We highlighted the critical need for a unified national surveillance system that integrates with regional and global efforts, leverages technological advancements, and ensures data integrity.
Strengthening the framework for disease prevention and management requires: ensuring access to essential supplies, equipment, medications, and vaccines; enhancing the capacity and skills of the public health workforce.
Effective public health management relies on a well‐coordinated system that enables swift national and global decision‐making.
Additionally, risk communication and community engagement are essential for transparent information sharing and building trust among stakeholders.
Tracking progress on pandemic preparedness at the national level is essential.
Future research should explore ongoing preparedness efforts by countries, regional bodies, and global organizations for potential public health emergencies.
A qualitative investigation could provide insights into the challenges faced in implementing national pandemic preparedness plans, particularly in integrating evidence into the planning and execution stages.
Combining quantitative surveys with qualitative methods could offer a comprehensive assessment of a country's readiness, focusing on the domains specified in the PHEP model.
This jurisdictional scan has some limitations.
Our research involved navigating the websites of various international organizations and health ministries across different countries.
Keyword searches often yielded an overwhelming volume of documents, necessitating the establishment of a saturation point to maintain search feasibility.
We also encountered country‐level documents on various health ministry websites in local languages.
Documents not available in English were excluded from our consideration, potentially omitting valuable insights from the analysis.
In conclusion, this jurisdictional scan highlights that global and national public health preparedness plans align with the PHEP model, emphasizing early threat detection, rapid response, healthcare capacity building, medical supply management, and effective risk communication.
Although evidence‐based policymaking and investments in healthcare infrastructure are crucial, challenges remain in implementation, misinformation management, and sustained health funding.
Strengthening national surveillance systems, coordinated disease prevention frameworks, and robust risk communication strategies is essential for enhancing preparedness against infectious disease threats.
Addressing these challenges through evidence‐driven approaches and sustained investments will strengthen public health infrastructure and improve readiness for future health emergencies.
