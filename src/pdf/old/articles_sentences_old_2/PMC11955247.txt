The primary purpose of this study is to determine the experiences of individuals with chronic illnesses related to managing their illnesses after the February 6, 2023, Kahramanmaraş earthquake in Türkiye.
This study was conducted using phenomenological methodology.
The study employed purposeful and criterion sampling, and 12 participants were included.
Data were collected using an in‐depth interview technique and a semi‐structured interview form.
The data obtained showed that the central theme of the study was the earthquake process and that the data was analyzed in three categories: factors affecting illness management, changes in health status, and methods of coping with problems.
Various problems are experienced regarding managing chronic illnesses in the post‐earthquake period.
These problems leave short‐ or long‐term adverse effects on the individual or social level.
Failure to address chronic illnesses effectively in disasters causes short‐ and long‐term adverse effects on chronic patients.
Disaster response plans should be developed in a way that ensures that individuals with chronic illnesses have access to psychosocial support services, along with medication and medical devices.
Public awareness should be raised about the difficulties that individuals with chronic illnesses may face in disaster situations.
Rapid changes and difficulties in living conditions combined with disruptions in accessing and using health services make it difficult for individuals with chronic illnesses to manage their illnesses.
At the same time, these difficulties lead to mental and psychological changes and make illness management even more difficult.
The widely used and considered most effective chronic care model in chronic illness management aims to improve the quality of care and minimize the cost of care by emphasizing the protection and promotion of health through primary health services.
The chronic illness management evaluated within the context of this model enables patients to ensure active participation, receive detailed information, and support their self‐management skills (Wagner2000; Wagner et al.2001).
Chronic illnesses are defined as long‐term health issues that induce irreversible structural and functional disorders.
Illness management, therefore, addresses holistic care to ease the course of conditions that cannot be treated with regular medical monitoring, support, and medical interventions.
Furthermore, illness management aims to optimize the patient's role and responsibility for their self‐care (World Health Organization (2023) [WHO] [Online]; Non‐communicable Diseases Country Profiles 2011; Available athttps://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/44704; Access Date: 17.04.2023).
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Center for Health Statistics define chronic illnesses as long‐term and typically slow‐progressed illnesses and illnesses that persist for 3 months or longer.
Almost 41 million individuals annually lose their lives due to chronic illnesses.
This figure represents 74% of all fatalities worldwide.
Every year, approximately 17 million individuals die before the age of 70, and 86% of these premature fatalities occur in low‐ and middle‐income nations.
The chronic illnesses that most frequently induce mortality are cardiovascular illnesses, cancer, chronic respiratory illnesses, and diabetes, accounting for 17.9 million, 9.3 million, 4.1 million, and 2 million losses worldwide, respectively (https://www.who.int/news‐room/fact‐sheets/detail/noncommunicable‐diseases).
According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK)2018data, however, the illnesses that most commonly result in fatality are circulatory system illnesses, benign and malignant tumors, and respiratory system illnesses, with rates of 38.4%, 19.7%, and 12.5%, respectively (https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Olum‐Nedeni‐Istatistikleri‐2018‐30626).
Managing a chronic illness is crucial for individuals with chronic illnesses in terms of illness prognosis (Mossialos et al.2015).
The management of chronic illnesses involves not only the treatment of the illness but also the patient's acquisition of self‐management skills, getting used to living with the condition, and elevating the level of coping with its stress.
Chronic illness management also facilitates adherence to therapy, lessens illness symptoms, improves life quality, and decelerates the illness process or delays its progression (Cutler et al.2018; Kini and Ho2018).
However, some crises may hinder illness management.
Indeed, the unexpected experiences of individuals may influence their responses to the crisis and their level of crisis‐based stress management.
Naturally occurring disasters like earthquakes are one of these crises (Vallis et al.2019; Tahernejad et al.2023).
Disasters also induce an adverse effect on the health requirements of individuals with chronic illnesses, causing difficulties in the provision of medical care services throughout disasters (Ghazanchaei et al.2023).
The literature review revealed that a study conducted 5 years after the Japan earthquake reported a higher incidence of renal failure caused by hypertension.
Accordingly, dialysis patients increased substantially (Abe et al.2022).
The Kahramanmaraş earthquake, which had magnitudes of 7.7 and 7.4, occurred on February 6, 2023, resulting in significant damage across 11 provinces in southern and southeastern Türkiye.
Residents in the impact zone were compelled to vacate their homes for several weeks due to the risk of building collapse and associated fears, resulting in their temporary residence on the streets, in vehicles, or tents.
Numerous survivors were forcibly relocated, either permanently or temporarily, from their place of residence.
Multiple factors contributed to the inability to access or utilize healthcare services, including the collapse of health institution buildings, significant casualties among health personnel, outages of utilities such as internet, transportation, and energy, and adverse weather conditions.
The sudden catastrophe prompted individuals to alter their daily routines.
Earthquake disasters significantly impact individuals, potentially resulting in new health‐related issues such as mental health impairments, temporary or permanent physical injuries, and physiological disorders.
It may adversely impact processes, including managing and treating pre‐existing health conditions.
Limited or absent access to medications, insufficient medical devices, challenges in adhering to nutritional diets, unsanitary living conditions, disrupted sleep patterns, heightened stress levels, and barriers to health services can exacerbate pre‐existing health symptoms in individuals with chronic illnesses during chaotic situations akin to earthquakes.
Therefore, it is essential to implement measures such as emergency planning, enhancing health infrastructure, and increasing public awareness to ensure effective chronic illness management in the aftermath of an earthquake.
Effective planning and execution of measures against potential future earthquake disasters necessitate a thorough assessment and analysis of how individuals with chronic illnesses are impacted by illness management in the post‐earthquake context and the primary factors influencing their experiences.
This research aimed to evaluate the experiences of individuals with chronic illnesses in managing their conditions after the Kahramanmaraş earthquake in Türkiye on February 6, 2023.
The research data acquired under the chronic care model is anticipated to inform various studies on enhancing health and care outcomes for individuals with chronic illnesses.
Furthermore, the objective is to enhance public knowledge and measures for improvement concerning the post‐disaster challenges faced by those with chronic illnesses during illness management.
Indeed, the current research data may offer an insightful perspective to elaborate on the health/care outcomes of individuals with chronic illnesses in the aftermath of the earthquake and provide guidance in helping identify effective intervention strategies for chronic illness management.
This research aims to elucidate the impact of earthquakes on individuals with chronic illnesses, to emphasize the essential steps for identifying the unmet needs of individuals with chronic illnesses in disaster situations, and thus to enhance social awareness among the general public, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.
This research aims to enhance societal awareness regarding the specific challenges earthquakes pose in the context of chronic illnesses.
Such awareness and sensitivity are expected to yield increased public support, heightened societal interest, and the promotion of more effective solutions to these challenges.
Advancements in emergency planning, health services, and community support networks can enhance the formulation of more effective policies and strategies for managing chronic illnesses during disaster scenarios.
This qualitative study is based on an interpretative phenomenological approach.
The focus of phenomenology is on experiences that individuals are aware of but retain no detailed and in‐depth comprehension (Yıldırım and Şimşek2021; Bonyadi2023).
The study also used this design to carefully scrutinize the illness management experiences of chronic patients who survived the Kahramanmaraş earthquake.
This study employed purposive sampling, a prevalent method in qualitative research methodologies.
While the findings from qualitative research do not aim for generalization to the broader population, purposive sampling often serves as an effective method for in‐depth examination of specific situations or individuals of interest (Creswell2007).
This study utilized criterion sampling, a form of purposive sampling.
Criterion sampling establishes specific criteria and evaluates all options that fulfill these criteria.
Criteria may be predetermined, or researchers may develop a list of their research criteria (Yıldırım and Şimşek2021).
The study's inclusion criteria specified individuals residing in Osmaniye, a province designated as a disaster zone due to the significant earthquake centered in Kahramanmaraş, who possess any chronic illness and survived the earthquake.
The study's exclusion criteria included individuals not directly affected by the disaster, those with health conditions unsuitable for interviewing, and individuals facing Turkish language and communication barriers.
The study gathered data via semi‐structured interviews.
The main aim of the interview is to uncover the participants' emotions, thoughts, and beliefs regarding the research topic (Patton2002).
The researchers in this study opted for semi‐structured interviews to elucidate the feelings, opinions, and experiences of individuals with chronic illnesses, particularly regarding the impact of the Kahramanmaraş earthquake on their illness management.
The semi‐structured interview sheet included 14 questions and probes related to these inquiries, formulated based on a comprehensive literature review of the research topic (Khankeh et al.2020; Kc et al.2019).
Expert opinions were solicited regarding the interview form questions, leading to their revision.
Initially, the interview question posed was, “Did you experience any changes/issues about your illness during the earthquake?” However, following expert feedback, researchers modified it to: “Did you have any problems with your illness during the earthquake?” “Did you observe any alterations in your illness during the earthquake?” Another interview question was revised from “Did the container/tent you live in after the earthquake affect your illness or illness management?” to “How did the container/tent you live in affect your illness or illness management after the earthquake?” The interview question, “Did you require any illness management during the earthquake period?” was modified to “What were your needs regarding illness management during the earthquake period?” Table1presents examples of interview questions that have been revised by expert feedback.
The study data were collected in an institution that provides primary health care services.
Individuals with chronic illnesses who access this institution for any reason were informed about the study by the first researcher, and interviews were conducted with individuals who agreed to participate in the study in a suitable room within the institution.
No one other than the researcher and the participant was allowed in the interview room.
The first researcher, a specialist in qualitative research, commenced the interview procedure.
The researcher elucidated the research objectives to the participants, indicating that there was no definitive solution to the posed questions, and they were urged to express their perspectives and insights.
During the interview, the researcher made the utmost effort to establish eye contact with the participants and used the proper tone.
In line with participants' consent, the interviewer audio‐recorded the interview with a mobile phone and took notes during the interview.
Each interview lasted approximately 25 min.
Face‐to‐face interviews were conducted with the participants in a friendly environment that was away from distractions and suitable for the participants' comfort.
When no new information emerged during the data collection process and the content of the interviewing started to repeat, the researcher thought that data saturation was achieved and ended the research with 12 participants.
The first researcher performed the interviews.
Another researcher transcribed the interview records; however, all researchers participated in the necessary analyses.
The researchers do not have any relationship with the prior to the interviewing participants.
The first researcher conducted interviews in a professional environment to maintain objectivity, and any prejudice or personal opinion of the researchers did not affect the data collection process.
The researcher who conducted the interviews was a woman and an academic who had completed her PhD in Internal Medicine Nursing.
She received training in qualitative research methods.
Three researchers specialize in nursing, focusing on health, community health nursing, nursing care, and practices.
The researchers, residing in various provinces within the earthquake‐affected region, are survivors who have profoundly experienced the earthquake's impacts in their respective areas.
Despite being specialized health professionals, they are unable to engage in the management of individuals with chronic illnesses.
The researchers were motivated to explore this topic following the earthquake, believing their observations and experiences during the disaster enhanced the study.
Approval for the study was granted by the Osmaniye Korkut Ata University Scientific Research and Publication Ethics Committee (Approval Date: 30.05.2023, Approval Number: 2023/6/12) and the Osmaniye Provincial Health Directorate (dated 04.07.2023, numbered 126371).
The researcher conducting the interview informed participants of the study's aims, secured their written and verbal consent, and included them in the study.
This study adheres to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist for qualitative studies.
The audio recordings are housed in an encrypted directory on the primary researcher's computer.
The research employed content analysis to examine data gathered from semi‐structured interviews.
Researchers generated a 58‐page transcript from the interview records for content analysis.
They read the statements in the transcript sentence by sentence and underlined the identified codes.
By the interview questions, researchers categorized the underlined codes and formulated themes derived from these categories.
Two scholars—one specializing in internal medicine nursing and the other in qualitative research—offered expert evaluations on the themes, categories, and codes the researchers identified, assessed, and mutually agreed upon.
The researchers established consistency among themes, categories, and codes, ensuring data validity and reliability.
The first, second, and fourth researchers reviewed the themes, categories, and codes produced by the third researcher.
Following the consultation of expert opinions, researchers implemented the required revisions and achieved consensus to examine the codes within a thematic framework and three distinct categories.
Accordingly, the research theme was the earthquake impact, whereas the categories were factors affecting illness management, changes in health status, and coping mechanisms with problems.
While there was a consensus on the names of the themes and categories, all researchers mutually agreed to rename the “experienced illness management‐related issues” category—designated by the third researcher—as “factors affecting illness management.” The researchers kept the original names of the participants confidential by adhering to ethical rules throughout the study.
Instead, they assigned a participant code and number based on gender (for instance, F1, F2… for female participants and M1, M2… for male participants).
As relevant to the nature of the qualitative data, the research presented the data validity and reliability under the titles of internal validity (credibility), external validity (transferability), internal reliability (consistency), and external reliability (confirmability).
Qualitative research involves various methods, including participant confirmation, long‐term interaction, and expert analysis to elevate internal validity—in other words, credibility (Holloway and Wheeler2010).
This study provided access to the semi‐structured interview queries generated by the researchers so that the relevant experts could analyze their clarity and conformity.
In line with the expert opinions and suggestions, researchers reevaluated the interview questions and made necessary revisions.
Researchers also verified the participants' responses to each question by repeating their replies.
They also promptly clarified these responses during the interview if there was confusion.
The results section included verbatim quotations taken directly from participant responses in the interview.
The study sought to enhance internal validity by incorporating participant confirmation, expert recommendations, and direct quotations.
The primary limitation to the internal validity of this study is the exclusive use of a semi‐structured interview format for data collection.
This study described in detail the research sample, research design, data collection tools, data collection process, data analysis, and the arrangement of the results to ensure external validity (transferability).
Furthermore, the research sample also included relevant individuals (participants) who would contribute to the research objective.
The researchers took voice recordings by smart telephone during the data collection process to minimize potential data loss, and they also presented the readers with all of the data they collected without making any commentary to ensure internal reliability—in other words, consistency.
Furthermore, the third and fourth researchers verified the generated codes by reading the data independently from the first and second researchers.
As a result, researchers reached a consensus about the categories and themes derived from the codes.
Researchers discussed the consistency of the results and conclusion sections for the external reliability of the study.
Accordingly, they mutually agreed to receive the approval of a qualitative research expert for the suitability of the data in the results and conclusion sections.
A total of 12 participants were included in the study since data saturation was reached.
The personal characteristics of these participants are presented in Table2.
Abbreviations: CAD, coronary artery disease; CRF, chronic kidney failure; CVD, cerebrovascular disease; DM, diabetes mellitus/diabetes; FMF, familial Mediterranean fever; HF, heart failure; HT, hypertension/high blood pressure.
Table3displays the participants' views on the factors affecting illness management in the post‐earthquake period.
Participants reportedly indicated that the issues related to nutrition, shelter, higher stress levels, and lack of access to health services, medications, and medical equipment in the post‐earthquake period adversely affected their illness management.
Categories and codes according to participants' responses.
Table3indicates participants' health status changes during the post‐earthquake period.
Accordingly, the study revealed that the participants experienced various adverse mental and psychological changes during the post‐earthquake period.
Table3displays the findings about the participants' post‐earthquake coping mechanisms with the problems.
Participants stated their coping mechanisms as professional support, social support, focusing attention elsewhere, religion‐oriented practices, crying, and smoking.
Table3indicates that participants faced adverse post‐earthquake challenges, including access to nutrition, health services, shelter, medications, and medical devices, significantly increasing their stress levels.
The primary factors influencing participants' experiences are the challenges encountered during the post‐earthquake period and the effect of these challenges on their illness management.
The challenges, uncertainties, and insecurities following the earthquake heightened the participants' stress levels.
This situation may directly influence physical health and adversely impact the management of emotional and mental illnesses.
From a phenomenological viewpoint, these experiences are influenced by participants' perceptions, emotions, and prior experiences.
The results indicated that the participants, when combined with their existing illnesses, represented a disadvantaged group relative to other earthquake victims without chronic conditions.
Failure or delay in addressing the needs of individuals dependent on family caregivers, requiring essential medication and medical equipment for survival—such as oxygen masks, nebulizers, sphygmomanometers, and glucometers—and adhering to a prescribed diet results in adverse experiences.
Simultaneously, these experiences induce uncertainty and anxiety in individuals, leading to elevated stress levels and adversely impacting their overall health status.
This study indicates that these factors must be considered in post‐disaster interventions, and the needs of individuals concerning illness management should be addressed promptly.
Following the 2001 El Salvador earthquake, a study involving both rural and urban communities documented that 79% of participants experienced chronic illness exacerbations, and 55% failed to access healthcare.
They also observed that individuals with mental health symptoms were significantly at risk of managing their chronic illnesses.
They additionally reported that in the post‐earthquake period, patients residing in rural areas had a 14.6% lower ability to manage their chronic illnesses (Woersching and Snyder2003).
Another post‐earthquake study—the 1976 Tangshan earthquake—on a retrospective cohort scrutinized the long‐term effect of earthquake‐related stress on the incidence of impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus among survivors, identifying that these incidences were significantly higher among the exposed groups (survivors) compared to the control group.
They further reported that those who lost their relatives displayed a higher incidence of diabetes than others (An et al.2014).
Another study focusing on the short and long‐term effects of the Marmara earthquake, which struck Türkiye on August 17, 1999, on 88 individuals with type 1 diabetes on HbA1c, insulin need, and quality of life found that the Marmara earthquake affected the glycemic control and quality of life of individuals with type 1 diabetes in the short term; however, these adverse effects faded away in the long term.
Nevertheless, their HbA1c levels and insulin needs increased in the third month after the earthquake (Sengül et al.2004).
The results of these studies support our study.
Accordingly, an earthquake causes negative experiences in illness management, and individuals should be observed in terms of the short and long‐term effects of these negative experiences.
In addition to this information, the information obtained in our study is thought to provide valuable contributions to all stakeholders who strive to understand the post‐disaster experiences of individuals with chronic illnesses and improve their access to health services.
It will contribute to understanding the post‐disaster experiences of individuals with chronic illnesses and, in particular, raise awareness about the challenges encountered after disasters and the effects of these challenges on illness management.
Thus, individuals will be better prepared and able to take measures to meet their needs.
In addition, health professionals can use this information to understand better the factors affecting illness management and be more effective in post‐disaster interventions.
In particular, it will help them to be more sensitive in identifying and meeting the needs of individuals with chronic illnesses in disaster situations and to take necessary measures.
When we look at the societal level, individuals who make up society will be able to develop a more empathetic attitude by understanding the difficulties experienced by individuals with chronic illnesses after a disaster.
This information will contribute to society being more solidaristic in post‐disaster interventions and provide more support to meet the needs of individuals with chronic illnesses.
In addition, this information may encourage researchers to study more in‐depth post‐disaster healthcare access and illness management and provide a basis for developing post‐disaster response strategies and a better understanding of the needs of individuals with chronic illnesses.
In conclusion, this research data is anticipated to enhance access to post‐disaster health services and the management of chronic illnesses, thus elevating society's general health and cohesion.
Table3indicates that participants reported experiencing negative physiological changes related to illness during the post‐earthquake period, with some also noting adverse effects on their mental states alongside these physiological changes.
The management of chronic illnesses typically requires a multi‐disciplinary approach involving healthcare professionals, patients, their support networks, society, and administrative bodies.
However, chaotic disaster situations characterized by limited or absent resources can result in increased exacerbations of illness, disabilities, and mortality rates (Mokdad et al.2005).
Furthermore, individuals with chronic illnesses face disadvantages as health, rescue, and aid services have historically prioritized injuries, emergencies, and pandemics in the context of disasters and other crises (Miller and Arquilla2008).
Identifying individuals disproportionately affected by disaster conditions and the subsequent recovery process is crucial.
This involves assessing their specific needs, fostering disaster awareness and safety culture, addressing inequities to ensure that post‐disaster services are accessible to all societal segments with special needs, and ultimately building a resilient society (Okay and İnal2019).
This study aligns with existing literature, indicating an increase in illness exacerbations during the post‐disaster period, alongside significant negative physiological and psychological experiences reported by patients.
This study assists public administrators in identifying the policies to implement following a disaster.
Three months after the Kobe earthquake, Wang et al. (2000) studied psychological well‐being and life quality.
They discovered that survivors in the earthquake zone had much higher psychological issues than individuals living in other areas.
Kirizuka et al. (1997) also reported that the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of diabetic patients increased approximately 2 months after the Great Hanshin‐Awaji Earthquake.
In another study on the Great East Japan Earthquake, Nishikawa et al. (2015) identified that diabetic patients who visited the hospital periodically experienced no increase in HbA1c levels; consequently, they concluded that regular access to care could keep diabetic patients in their current state.
Ohkouchi et al. (2013) found a 2.5‐fold increase in COPD exacerbations in the 2011 earthquake year compared to the same period of the previous year.
He et al. (2010) monitored six patients' blood pressure (BP) during the Sichuan earthquake.
They identified that their BP average dramatically rose to 150/98 during and post‐earthquake periods, while their pre‐earthquake average BP was 127/80.
Longer‐term studies in Japan also revealed that Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients' morning blood pressure was higher for 6 months.
These studies also reported higher urinary albumin excretion rates and HbA1c levels for 6 months among these patients, albeit with no change in their cholesterol levels (Kamoi et al.2006).
A study by Bland et al. (2000) 4 years after the earthquake in Italy analyzed coronary heart illness risk variables, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol level among individuals experiencing the earthquake.
As a result, they identified no long‐term correlations between blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
In contrast, they found higher resting heart rates among patients who experienced financial losses, moved farther away from home, and had rare family and friend visits.
Studies also reported that the Great Hanshin earthquake, which struck the Kobe‐Osaka region of Japan on January 17, 1995, with a magnitude of 7.2, aggravated the physical and mental conditions of patients with chronic illnesses, as they were unable to access their medications and had to live in unfavorable living conditions.
Specifically, many patients with chronic illnesses develop pneumonia when they get cold.
Moreover, these studies also indicated that patients with chronic illnesses were more prone to insomnia and tiredness (Baba et al.1996; Tsujiuchi et al.1996).
After the hurricane disaster that struck the Caribbean in 2017, which resulted in devastating earthquake‐like effects, 71.3% of the casualties reportedly occurred due to uncontrollable chronic illnesses (Bell et al.2020).
This information supports the data of this study and shows that the earthquake negatively affected the health status of individuals with chronic illnesses.
At the same time, it reveals that patients require close follow‐up in the post‐earthquake period.
Table3summarizes the participants' coping strategies with the experienced post‐earthquake problems.
Accordingly, this study found that the participants strived to use variables such as professional support, social support, diverting attention elsewhere, religion‐oriented practices, crying, and smoking as coping mechanisms.
Undoubtedly, earthquakes devastatingly affect individuals; hence, they rank among the most traumatic events that profoundly disrupt daily life by causing medical, economic, and spiritual destruction.
Studies reported that traumatic events adversely affect individuals' capacity to relate to their own emotions, their sense of control and meaning, and their existing coping strategies, leading to individuals experiencing diverse feelings, such as hopelessness, helplessness, and burnout (Ozturk2003).
Nearly all of the earthquake survivors suffer from psychological trauma, even though some of them merely undergo physical injuries (Aydın2023).
However, not all survivors are affected equally by the psychological fallout from severe traumatic events like earthquakes (Halpern and Vermeulen2017).
The literature lacks studies that examine how individuals with chronic illnesses navigate the post‐earthquake recovery process.
According to the study by Mori et al. (2007) and Ikeda et al. (1998) examined the post‐disaster self‐care of patients with hypertension, chronic heart failure, diabetes, or bronchial asthma following the Great Hanshin earthquake.
The findings indicated that experiences such as the loss of a relative, the physical environment and living conditions of temporary shelters, inadequate self‐management due to knowledge deficits, age‐related changes in physical function, poor pain control, and financial difficulties contributed to impaired or worsened self‐care among participants.
Additionally, upon identifying their subjective symptoms, participants reassessed their self‐care practices, particularly by enhancing their management of blood pressure and blood sugar levels, modifying their diet, implementing strategies to reduce psychological stress, undergoing medical examinations, resuming previously discontinued medications, and employing pain management techniques (Mori et al.2007).
This phenomenological study conducted by Tosun (2023) following the Kahramanmaraş earthquake on February 6, 2023, sought to examine survivors' perceptions of the disaster, the coping mechanisms they employed to address post‐earthquake stress, and their references to religious coping strategies within these mechanisms.
He identified that the participants employed nine distinct coping mechanisms: psychologist support, psychiatrist support, family support, friend support, government support, hope, religious coping, autosuggestion, and personal decision‐making, with religion being the most frequently cited mechanism.
Survivors identified seven distinct religious coping strategies: reading the Quran, finding solace in the lives of the Prophet, praying, performing salaat, seeking advice and conversing with religious individuals, expressing gratitude, and believing in the afterlife.
Notably, “praying” was the most frequently cited coping mechanism.
In contrast to the sample groups of these studies, our research data indicate distinct experiences concerning coping methods associated with the challenges faced by individuals with chronic illnesses following the earthquake, a traumatic event.
The study's data will significantly contribute to the literature and inform practices to address physiological and psychological issues in the post‐earthquake context.
Sharing traumatic and emotionally charged topics such as chronic illness and post‐earthquake experiences may have caused some participants to have emotional difficulties and not share some information during the interview.
This may have limited the depth of the data obtained.
The research was conducted only in Osmaniye and does not cover the experiences of individuals in other disaster provinces or regions with different demographic characteristics.
Another limitation is that the experiences of individuals with chronic diseases in different provinces were not investigated to provide a broader perspective.
The research findings concluded that failure to address chronic illnesses effectively in disasters may cause short‐ and long‐term adverse effects on chronic patients.
These negative effects may cause suffering not only to patients themselves but also to their families and public health; consequently, they may result in significant losses in terms of health expenditures.
Chronically ill individuals are among the vulnerable groups that require special attention during the planning, intervention, and recovery stages of disasters due to their unique needs, which include medication, medical equipment, shelter, and nutrition in a healthy environment, sustainable medical care, situations requiring emergency or intensive care, and the potential for exacerbation of illnesses.
Therefore, considering the issue in the chronic care model used in managing chronic illnesses, chronic illnesses are the vital component that disaster medical response must address.
Public activists, policymakers, and national and local administrators should take the initiative to plan the necessary steps to maintain and further improve the current situation for chronic illnesses in disasters.
In this context, post‐disaster emergency health services should be provided quickly to facilitate access to health services.
Post‐disaster response plans should be developed to ensure access to medicines and medical devices for individuals with chronic illnesses.
In addition, the provision of psychosocial support services should help individuals with chronic illnesses reduce stress levels and improve illness management.
It is also recommended that public awareness be raised about the challenges that individuals with chronic illnesses may face in disaster situations through education and awareness activities.
This study's findings emphasize that managing chronic illnesses is a priority in disaster situations.
In clinical practice, the rapid provision of emergency health services after a disaster and guaranteeing access to medicines and medical devices required to manage chronic illnesses will contribute to overall public health by reducing the harmful effects experienced by chronic patients and their families.
In addition, since the research findings comprehensively address the problems experienced by individuals with chronic illnesses after disasters, they also reveal the nursing care practices that these patients need related to chronic illnesses management in case of disaster.
Evidence‐based research is needed to provide quality health services after a disaster, to manage chronic illnesses, and to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing care practices.
