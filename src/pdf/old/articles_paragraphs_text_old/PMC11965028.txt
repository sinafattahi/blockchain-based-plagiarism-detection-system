Enteral feeding interruption (EFI) is a frequent issue in ICU settings, affecting nutritional adequacy and delaying recovery in critically ill patients. While tools exist to assess patients' nutritional status, no instrument evaluates ICU staff's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in EFI management.

To develop a reliable and valid EFI management scale for ICU medical staff based on the KAP model.

This instrument development study followed the STROBE guidelines, utilizing a cross‐sectional, multi‐centre approach in Wuhan. A convenience sample of 400 ICU staff from eight tertiary A hospitals and two tertiary B hospitals was included between May 2021 and March 2022. A preliminary scale was constructed through literature review, interviews and expert consultations. The sample was used to assess the scale's reliability and validity.

The final EFI management scale comprised 41 items across three dimensions, with cumulative variance contributions of 70.341%, 70.437% and 66.550%. Cronbach's α ranged from 0.919 to 0.947, with test–retest reliability between 0.488 and 0.836. The total scale had a Cronbach's α of 0.953 and test–retest reliability of 0.977. Content validity indices (I‐CVI) ranged from 0.800 to 1.000, and the scale‐level CVI was 0.975.

The EFI Management KAP Scale is a valid, reliable tool for assessing ICU medical staff's management of EFI.

The EFI Management KAP Scale addresses a critical gap in the standardized evaluation of critical care nurses' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding enteral feeding interruptions. By providing a validated tool, this scale enables the identification of specific barriers and facilitators to optimal enteral nutrition delivery in critically ill patients. Its application can guide targeted educational interventions, inform policy adjustments and enhance multidisciplinary collaboration in the ICU. Ultimately, this scale supports improved enteral nutrition management, reducing complications associated with feeding interruptions and contributing to better patient outcomes in critical care settings.

Enteral feeding interruptions are common in ICU settings and are associated with adverse patient outcomes, including malnutrition and increased morbidity.

Effective management of feeding interruptions requires ICU medical staff to have adequate knowledge, positive attitudes and appropriate practices.

There is no validated tool to comprehensively assess ICU staff's knowledge, attitudes and practices related to managing enteral feeding interruptions.

This study presents the development and validation of a novel “Enteral Feeding Interruption Management Scale,” specifically designed for ICU medical staff.

The scale provides a standardized method to evaluate and identify gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practices, thereby facilitating targeted interventions.

Its application can inform clinical education, enhance evidence‐based feeding protocols and ultimately improve nutritional outcomes for critically ill patients.

Enteral nutrition (EN) is a method of delivering essential nutrients via a feeding tube to meet human metabolic requirements.1,2It is a cornerstone of nutritional support therapy for critically ill patients, leveraging gastrointestinal functionality to modulate the microbiota, preserve intestinal mucosal barriers, reduce infection rates, enhance immune responses and promote gastrointestinal motility.3,4Recognizing its critical importance, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) recommended EN as the primary nutritional support for critically ill adults in their 2016 guidelines.5Early initiation of enteral nutrition (EN) not only supports nutritional status but also maintains intestinal mucosal integrity, aiding recovery. Similarly, the 2019 ESPEN guidelines advocate for the continuous provision of EN to avoid interruptions and optimize patient outcomes.6Despite these recommendations, EN interruptions remain a significant challenge in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI), often triggered by severe trauma, hemodynamic instability, or physiological stress, is a frequent cause of these interruptions.7,8Reports indicate that EN interruptions affect 54%–84% of ICU patients and occur during 38%–100% of their ICU stay,8reducing energy intake and impacting outcomes. Lee et al. reported energy deficits of 1780.23 kcal and protein losses of 100.58 g due to these interruptions.7Such deficits can impair immune function, delay wound healing, increase infection risk, prolong ICU stays and elevate mortality rates.

ICU physicians and nurses play crucial roles in formulating EN plans, assessing nutritional needs, monitoring complications and evaluating outcomes.9,10,11However, the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of health care professionals regarding EN interruptions remain underexplored. KAP assessment tools are widely used in health care research to evaluate and enhance professional competencies and behaviours by identifying gaps and targeting interventions. For example, KAP frameworks have been instrumental in improving adherence to infection control measures, occupational health and safety, and enhancing waste management practices.12,13,14By understanding health care workers' knowledge and perceptions, targeted educational and behavioural interventions can be designed to improve clinical practices and patient outcomes.

Currently, there is a global scarcity of validated tools specifically addressing KAP related to EN interruptions in ICU settings. This gap limits the ability to systematically assess and address the factors contributing to EN interruptions. Developing an ICU‐specific EN interruption KAP assessment tool would facilitate the identification of knowledge deficits, attitudinal barriers and suboptimal practices among health care professionals. Furthermore, such a tool could guide the development of targeted training programmes, enhance adherence to evidence‐based EN protocols and ultimately reduce the frequency and impact of EN interruptions. Addressing this unmet need is essential for improving the nutritional management and clinical outcomes of critically ill patients.

A cross‐sectional, descriptive multi‐centre study was conducted in Wuhan to evaluate the validity and reliability of the EFI Management KAP Scale for ICU medical staff. The study adhered to the STROBE guidelines, and a convenience sampling method was used. As recommended in the literature, the sample size in clinimetric studies is usually set considering at least 5–10 subjects for each item15,16; the final 49‐item scale required 245–490 participants. To account for potential invalid responses, the sample size was increased by 15%. A total of 400 ICU health care workers from 8 tertiary‐level A and 2 tertiary‐level B hospitals in Wuhan were recruited between May 2021 and March 2022. Inclusion criteria: (1) age >18 years; (2) having a health professional qualification; (3) being employed in the ICU; (4) having the ability to comprehend scale items accurately; (5) informed consent and willingness to participate. Exclusion criteria included ICU vacationers or staff involved in rotations, training, or further medical education. In the qualitative interviews part, purposive sampling procedures were used, and participants were deliberately invited due to their unique insights related to their experience with EN17; sampling was considered complete when no new significant themes emerged during the interviews.

The research team comprised an ICU clinical administrator with a deputy senior title and master's supervisor qualification, a deputy chief physician with a senior title and PhD, two clinical researchers with master's degrees and three ICU clinical staff members with bachelor's degrees. The team's responsibilities included creating the initial item pool through literature reviews and interviews, selecting experts, distributing and collecting expert surveys, refining scale items, and performing item analysis and reliability testing to finalize the KAP scale.

Based on the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) model, a systematic literature search was conducted in databases including CNKI, Wanfang, China Biomedical Literature (CBM), PubMed, EmBase, Web of Science and CINAHL. Search terms such as “critically ill patients,” “enteral nutrition,” and “feeding interruption” were used. Additionally, we reviewed relevant materials from professional organizations such as the Chinese Society of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition, the Chinese Society of Critical Care Medicine, and international bodies like the European and American Societies for Clinical Nutrition and Critical Care.

To align the scale with the clinical and cultural context of critical care in China, in‐depth interviews were conducted in June 2021, including four ICU clinicians, three nutritional support nurses and five ICU nursing team leaders from a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. Topics included the significance of enteral nutrition, perceptions of feeding interruptions, causes, strategies for managing interruptions and their impact on patients. These interviews were recorded using a digital audio recorder to ensure high‐quality data capture. The recordings were transcribed verbatim, maintaining accuracy and capturing nuances in language and expression. Transcriptions were then subjected to thematic analysis, a method well suited for identifying and interpreting patterns within qualitative data.18The analysis process began with multiple readings of the transcripts to achieve data familiarization. Initial codes were generated to identify significant statements and concepts related to the interview topics. Both inductive and deductive coding approaches were employed: inductive coding allowed for the emergence of themes directly from the data, while deductive coding was guided by the Knowledge‐Attitude‐Practice (KAP) framework. These codes were organized into overarching themes and subthemes that captured participants' insights into EN interruptions. The identified themes were directly used for item generation. Item generation refers to the process of creating specific questions or statements (items) that reflect the constructs being measured. In this study, the process aimed to develop items that assess ICU health care professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding EN interruptions. Each item was crafted to be clear, concise and contextually relevant, ensuring that it accurately reflected the qualitative findings and aligned with the theoretical framework. This methodology is supported by best practices in scale development, where qualitative data provides a foundation for generating items that are both comprehensive and representative of the construct of interest.19By integrating participants' experiences and professional insights, the resulting scale ensures contextual relevance and practical applicability in critical care settings.

Referencing key publications such as the 2016 ASPEN guideline,5the 2018 CSPEN expert consensus20and the 2019 ESPEN guideline,6our research team previously developed an expert consensus on common complications of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients,21which was also included, and a preliminary pool of pre‐test scale entries was formulated. This pool comprised three dimensions: knowledge (16 entries), attitudes (10 entries), and practices (24 entries), totalling 50 entries. Following group discussion and analysis, combined with interview outcomes, this initial scale pool was established.

Expert consultations were conducted to assess the content validity of the ICU Enteral Nutrition Feeding Disruption scale. Two rounds of consultations were distributed via WeChat QR codes. Experts rated the importance of scale items using a 5‐point Likert scale, with a column for suggested revisions. Items scoring ≤3.50 or with a coefficient of variation ≥0.25 were marked for potential revision or deletion. Selection criteria required experts to have a Bachelor's degree or higher, an intermediate or senior title, at least 10 years of experience (or 5 years with a master's degree), and expertise in ICU or clinical nutrition. Opinions from the first round were consolidated within 3 weeks, followed by a second round of scale refinement. The consultation concluded with 20 experts from 15 tertiary hospitals across multiple provinces, with diverse expertise in clinical management, intensive care, nursing, medicine, surgery and emergency care.

In July 2021, 50 health care workers were selected from a tertiary hospital in Wuhan to pre‐test the scale. The aim was to assess the linguistic accuracy, semantic clarity and logical arrangement of the scale entries. After completing the pre‐test of the scale, a cross‐sectional, descriptive multi‐centre study was conducted in Wuhan to evaluate the validity and reliability of the EFI Management KAP Scale for ICU medical staff.

Data collection tool consists of two sections: the first section captures participants' general information, including gender, age, education, professional title, ICU experience, ICU type, membership in nutritional support groups, enteral feeding interruption training experience and knowledge level of enteral nutrition. The second section is the ICU Medical Staff EFI knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) scale, consisting of 49 items across three dimensions: knowledge (16 items), attitude (10 items) and practice (23 items). Each item is rated on a five‐point Likert scale. Knowledge items range from 1 (completely uninformed) to 5 (completely understood), attitude items range from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), and practice items range from 1 (never) to 5 (always).

The Scale Star platform was used for distributing and collecting data. ICU directors and head nurses from 10 Wuhan hospitals were informed about the study's objectives, content and criteria. After obtaining consent, the survey was shared via a QR code. Standardized instructions clarified the study's purpose, completion methods and guidelines. To ensure data authenticity and prevent duplicate entries, each mobile device was restricted to a single response. The survey remained open for 2 weeks, after which access was closed automatically. Data were monitored and validated for completeness and accuracy. To assess test–retest reliability, 60 health care professionals retook the survey 30 days later.

Data from the scale were validated by two individuals and analysed using SPSS 22.0. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to provide evidence for the construct validity of the scale. Before EFA, the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test of sphericity were applied to determine whether the data were suitable for principal components analysis. For the qualitative data, thematic analysis was employed to identify and interpret patterns. The interviewer listened to the recordings, read the transcripts and conducted line‐by‐line coding after each interview. The notes were organized into categories of knowledge, attitude and practice using Microsoft Excel. These categories were subsequently discussed until a consensus was reached.

Discriminant analysis, question‐total correlation and principal component analysis were applied to evaluate scale item adequacy and consistency.22Discriminant analysis: The sample was divided into two groups (top and bottom 27% based on total scores). An independent t‐test was performed, and items withp< .05 and a decision value (CR) <3.000 were flagged for deletion. Total Correlation Coefficient: Items with Pearson correlation coefficients <0.4 or corrected item‐total correlation (CITC) <0.4 were considered weakly associated and flagged for deletion. Principal Component Analysis: Items with commonality <0.40 were considered for deletion if they were poorly aligned with the scale's common factor.

Construct Validity: Principal component analysis (PCA) and maximum orthogonal rotation (MORV) were used in exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to define scale structure. Factors with eigenvalues >1.0, contributing to cumulative variance >60%, with at least three items and loadings >0.5 were retained. Content Validity: Experts rated item importance, with a content validity index >0.7 for individual items and >0.9 for the overall scale considered acceptable.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (number: UHCT22094, date: 24, 02, 2022).

Two experts were involved to assess the content validity of the tool, and 400 were used to evaluate the tool.

Twenty clinical experts in critical care, nursing, internal medicine, surgery, emergency care, and clinical nutrition (6 males, 14 females; ages 31–58, mean 43.65 ± 7.55) participated in this study. Eight held bachelor's degrees, 10 had master's degrees and two had PhDs. Their titles ranged from intermediate to senior, with 6–39 years of experience (mean: 21.85 ± 9.77). All 20 questionnaires were returned across two consultation rounds, yielding a 100% response and validity rate. Authority coefficients were 0.92 and 0.93, indicating high expertise. Kendall's harmony coefficient improved from 0.205 in the first round to 0.613 in the second, demonstrating increased consensus.

Experts assessed language, clarity, and item sequence. Importance scores ranged from 4.00 to 5.00, with variation coefficients of 0.00–0.11. Two entries (A5, B15) exceeded a variation coefficient of 0.25, and two others (B14, B21) had differing perspectives. Three entries required sequencing adjustments (K3, K5, K12). After revisions, 1 entry was deleted, 17 were modified and 2 were merged. The final pre‐survey scale contained 49 entries: 16 for knowledge, 10 for attitude and 23 for practice.

The scale's completion time for ICU medical staff ranged from 5 to 12 min, allowing adequate comprehension of each entry. During the pretest, two scales had omitted responses. To address this, a “prevent omission” feature was added to the survey platform, ensuring all entries were completed before submission in the official survey. This adjustment improved data quality and minimized incomplete responses.

Of the 400 participants, 382 submitted valid questionnaires, yielding a 95.50% valid response rate. The cohort included 112 males and 270 females, aged 21–56 years (mean: 31.77 ± 6.99). It comprised 90 doctors and 292 nurses, with 230 holding junior titles, 105 intermediate titles and 47 senior titles. Additionally, 53.66% (205) had over 5 years of ICU experience, and 349 participants held at least a bachelor's degree. Most participants (81.68%) worked in comprehensive ICUs, with 26.44% involved in enteral nutrition groups. The majority (86.13%) were from tertiary hospitals. The main source of knowledge on enteral nutrition interruptions was hospital/departmental lectures (74.08%), while only 9.69% relied on academic journals. Although 74.61% (285/382) had some knowledge of the topic, it was not comprehensive.

In Table1, it revealed decisive values of the scale entries from 8.711 to 18.596,p< .001, indicating reasonable scale design with good differentiation. Total correlation coefficients analysis identified entry B15 with a coefficient of 0.375 <0.40, leading to its deletion. Following this deletion, the remaining entries showed correlation coefficients with the total table ranging from 0.429 to 0.693, indicating acceptable item discrimination and internal consistency of the scale.

The mean values and Cronbach's alpha scores for individual items are given in Table2. Based on the findings, all items appear to contribute adequately to the reliability of the scale, with no single item negatively impacting overall consistency.

Mean values and Cronbach's alpha scores for individual items.

The Kaiser‐Meyer‐Olkin (KMO) values for the knowledge, attitude and practice dimensions of the scale were 0.938, 0.934 and 0.935, respectively. Bartlett's test of sphericity indicated significant differences (p< .001), confirming that the data were suitable for factor analysis. Six primary factors were extracted from the scale, in alignment with the scree plot (Figure1). These factors were categorized as follows: two factors within the knowledge dimension (concepts and consequences of enteral nutritional interruption, and causes and influencing factors of interruption); one factor within the attitude dimension (perceptions/attitudes toward nutritional interruption); and three factors within the practice dimension (Learning and Communication, Medical Operation Behaviour, and Patient Disease Status).

In the knowledge dimension, 16 entries were initially analysed, and 2 factors were extracted, each containing at least 3 entries. However, 2 entries (K5 and K7) showed dual loadings (both with loading values >0.5 on 2 factors and a difference of <0.2), leading to their deletion. After two rounds of exploratory analysis, 14 entries were retained in two distinct factors. Post‐rotation, these factors explained a cumulative variance of 70.341%, as detailed in Table1.

For the attitude dimension, all 10 entries were subjected to factor analysis, leading to the extraction of one factor. Each entry had a factor loading greater than 0.6 and a commonality value exceeding 0.4. Post‐rotation, the factor explained 70.437% of the cumulative variance, as detailed in Table1.

In the practice dimension, 22 entries were initially analysed, resulting in the extraction of 3 factors. However, entry B6 showed dual loading, and entry B23 had a factor loading below 0.5, leading to their removal. After reanalysis with 20 entries, entry B9 showed a loading below 0.5, and entries B13 and B20 had commonality values below 0.4, resulting in their deletion. After three rounds of analysis, 17 entries across 3 distinct factors remained, with a cumulative variance of 66.550% after rotation, as outlined in Table1.

The content validity index (CVI) was calculated based on expert ratings of each item's importance. The overall CVI for the scale was 0.975, while individual item CVIs ranged from 0.800 to 1.000, demonstrating strong content validity and comprehensiveness in assessing the scale's targeted domains.

The Inter‐Factor Correlation Matrix is given in Table3, which shows the correlations between the latent factors extracted from the scale. It can be seen that the correlations mostly range from 0.167 to 0.635, suggesting a moderate to strong relationship between some factors.

Item total statistics are presented in Table4, the Cronbach's α coefficient values are consistent (range: 0.911–0.954), indicating that no single item drastically affects the overall scale reliability.

In Table5, the mean score of the scale was 174.573 ± 19.424, the mean score in the knowledge dimension was 54.482 ± 9.266, the mean score in the attitude dimension was 47.183 ± 4.232, and the mean score in the practice dimension was 72.908 ± 9.653. The overall internal consistency of the scale, as indicated by a Cronbach's α coefficient, was 0.953. For subscale, Cronbach's α values ranged from 0.919 to 0.947. The scale also showed good stability with a test–retest reliability coefficient of 0.977, and test–retest reliability for the subscale ranged from 0.488 to 0.836. These metrics suggest the scale exhibits excellent internal consistency and satisfactory test–retest reliability.

Mean score, internal consistency and test–retest reliability results for subscale.

The final ICU Enteral Feeding Interruption knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) scale, after validity and reliability assessments, comprises 41 items across three dimensions, as shown in Appendix1. The knowledge dimension includes 14 items under two factors: concepts and consequences of enteral feeding interruptions and factors influencing interruptions. Each item is rated on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = “completely unaware,” 5 = “completely aware”), with a total possible score of 70. Higher scores indicate greater knowledge among ICU health care professionals. The attitude dimension consists of 10 items assessing perspectives on enteral nutrition interruptions, rated on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = “completely disagree,” 5 = “completely agree”), with a total score of 50. Higher scores reflect a stronger recognition of the importance of managing feeding interruptions. The practice dimension includes 17 items covering learning and communication, medical procedures and patient condition. Items are rated from 1 (“never”) to 5 (“always”), with a total score of 85. Higher scores signify better adherence to enteral feeding interruption practices.

Understanding health care professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices is essential for developing targeted training programs. Currently, no dedicated tool exists for assessing ICU professionals' perspectives on enteral feeding interruptions. Developing a tailored assessment tool will enable the investigation of their knowledge, attitudes and practices, providing insights for management to formulate focused quality improvement strategies.

This study employed the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) framework, integrating extensive literature reviews, interviews with clinical staff and expert consultations to construct the scale. A meticulous process refined the item pool and initial draft, clarifying variables within the conceptual framework. For instance, the definition of enteral feeding interruption was elaborated to include support methods, frequency and duration, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive assessment of interruption factors.

To refine the scale's content and ensure its relevance, in‐depth interviews were conducted with clinicians and nursing experts specializing in enteral nutrition. Their feedback enhanced the precision of language, clarity and logical sequencing of items. Two rounds of expert consultations followed, utilizing the Delphi method with 20 experts from 15 tertiary hospitals across eight provinces in China, alongside methodologists. The expert authority coefficients reached 0.92 and 0.93. Item revisions and sequence adjustments were based on these consultations, with a Kendall's coefficient of 0.613 in the second round, reflecting strong consensus.

The scale underwent discriminant analysis, total‐item correlation and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), supported by scree plots. All metrics met recommended thresholds,30affirming the scale's robustness. According to the methodology of scale development, it is mentioned that the time for retest reliability is generally between 2 and 4 weeks.16Based on discussions within the research team, to avoid overestimating the retest ability, we chose a 30‐day interval for assessing test–retest reliability. This rigorous approach strengthens the tool's validity and reliability, making it an effective instrument for evaluating ICU health care professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding enteral feeding interruptions.

This KAP assessment tool for ICU health care professionals has significant international relevance, especially for critical care nurses in diverse settings. While the scale was developed based on clinical and cultural contexts in China, its theoretical foundation—the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) framework—is universally applicable. The challenges of enteral feeding interruptions, including insufficient knowledge, suboptimal attitudes and inconsistent practices, are global issues in critical care. Studies from various countries have reported similar barriers to optimal enteral nutrition delivery, such as inconsistent protocols, lack of awareness and insufficient training.31,32Key features of this tool, such as its comprehensive consideration of interruption frequency, duration and underlying causes, make it adaptable to different health care systems. With minor contextual modifications, the scale can serve as a benchmark for assessing critical care nurses' competencies in managing enteral feeding interruptions worldwide.

Enteral feeding interruptions often result from health care professionals' insufficient knowledge and attention. Evaluating current knowledge and offering targeted training can update outdated perspectives and emphasize the importance of managing these interruptions. The scale serves as a practical tool, encouraging reflection and review of clinical practices, and fostering the integration of knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Regular use of this scale can improve ICU staff's ability to manage enteral nutrition, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing complications caused by interruptions.

This study has limitations. Convenience sampling may limit the representativeness of the findings. The lack of on‐site supervision could affect online survey quality. Participants were all from a single hospital in Wuhan, and regional differences in culture, health care policies and ICU practices suggest the need for further validation with a larger, more diverse sample for broader applicability. Lastly, as this is a cross‐sectional study, the responsiveness cannot be tested. Because of the lack of a recognized gold standard tool for KAP in this specific area, criterion validity has not yet been assessed. In future studies, we plan to establish the judgment criteria for the scale in conjunction with professional practice after completing external validation.

Critical care nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring the continuity of enteral nutrition, given their constant bedside presence and responsibility for monitoring and managing feeding protocols. The EFI Management KAP Scale is a valuable addition to the global effort to enhance enteral nutrition practices in ICUs. It provides a structured framework to identify knowledge gaps and areas for targeted professional development, enhancing nurses' understanding of the importance of uninterrupted EN. By standardizing clinical protocols and fostering adherence to evidence‐based practices, the tool supports nurses in effectively managing EN interruptions, thereby minimizing variability in care quality. Additionally, it promotes reflective practice, encouraging critical care nurses to continuously evaluate and improve their clinical approaches. The tool also facilitates multidisciplinary collaboration by offering insights into team‐wide practices, enabling cohesive efforts among nurses, physicians and dietitians to optimize EN delivery. Ultimately, its routine application can empower critical care nurses to play a proactive role in improving patient outcomes, such as maintaining adequate nutritional intake, reducing complications and promoting recovery in critically ill patients.

This EFI Management KAP Scale is a valuable addition to the global effort to enhance enteral nutrition practices in ICUs. Focusing on critical care nurses' knowledge, attitudes and practices, it provides actionable insights for education and quality improvement. Its potential for international adaptation underscores its broad utility in advancing critical care nursing standards. Integrating this tool into routine clinical practice can not only standardize care but also empower nurses to deliver more effective and patient‐centred nutritional support, ultimately improving outcomes for critically ill patients.
