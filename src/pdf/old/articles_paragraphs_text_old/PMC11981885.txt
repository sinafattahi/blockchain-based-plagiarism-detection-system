Glutamate (Glu) is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The measurement of Glu/glutamine (Gln) neurotransmitters in the brain provides valuable insights into the dynamic aspects of neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycles and can be accomplished through the detection of13C‐labeling of Glu and Gln during the administration of13C‐labeled glucose. Our goal is to evaluate the reproducibility of selective proton‐observed, carbon‐edited (selPOCE) MRS at 7 T for the detection of13C‐labeled Glu and Gln in the human brain. Data of three healthy participants, who were scanned twice at 7 T while undergoing [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion for 120 min, were used to detect13C‐labeled Glu and Gln in the brain, using selPOCE‐STEAM‐MRS. There was a rapid increase of plasma glucose13C fractional enrichment (FE) during the first 20 min of infusion, followed by a steady state of plasma glucose13C FE until the end of the [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion. The time courses of13C‐labeling of Glu and Gln were similar for test/retest. The test/retest variability was 15.8% for13C‐Glu and 33.3% for13C‐Gln. Knowing the variability of these readings using selPOCE‐STEAM‐MRS can inform the application to future studies on disease‐specific alterations in Glu/Gln cycling.

Data from three healthy participants scanned twice at 7 T during a 120 min [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion were used to detect13C‐labeled Glu and Gln in the brain using SelPOCE STEAM MRS. The13C labeling time courses of both metabolites were consistent across sessions. However, test/retest variability was higher for13C‐Gln compared to13C‐Glu.

The glutamate/glutamine (Glu/Gln) cycle is a crucial biochemical process within the central nervous system, involving the interplay between neurons and astrocytes [1]. Excitatory glutamatergic neurons take up glucose and oxidize it via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [2,3,4]. As such, neurons derive energy from glucose to facilitate neurotransmission, while neurons rely on astrocytes to provide Gln as a source for Glu. Neurons convert Gln to Glu through the action of phosphate‐activated glutaminase [5,6]. Changes in the Glu/Gln cycle have been reported in many diseases, such as hepatic encephalopathy, and in neurological and psychiatric disorders [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20].

Alterations in the levels of Glu and Gln in the brain have been assessed using1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). While informative,1H‐MRS measures only metabolite pool sizes and lacks the ability to directly assess metabolic fluxes, such as the Glu/Gln cycle. Additionally, the separation of Glu and Gln signals can be challenging, particularly at field strengths of 3 T and below [21]. In contrast,13C‐MRS, upon13C‐labeled glucose infusion, enables the quantification of metabolic rates and the neurotransmitter cycling of Glu/Gln in the brain [6,21]. For example, with13C‐MRS, it has been shown that rates of the neuronal TCA cycle (VTCAn) and Glu/Gln cycle are reduced in Alzheimer's disease [22]. Impaired Glu/Gln cycling has also been observed in epileptogenic tissues [15,23]. Additionally,13C‐MRS has revealed increased lactate turnover, consistent with the Warburg effect, in brain tumors [24]. Furthermore,13C‐MRS can be employed to assess the direct impact of (novel) drugs or therapeutic interventions on brain metabolism [25,26].

In vivo13C‐MRS methods can be categorized into direct and indirect detection techniques. Indirect13C‐MRS, or1H‐[13C]‐MRS, utilizes the1H‐13C‐coupling to identify protons attached to13C‐atoms and is inherently more sensitive than the direct detection of13C‐MRS, due to the approximately four times larger gyromagnetic ratio of1H compared to13C. As a result, indirect13C‐MRS can achieve higher signal‐to‐noise ratios, allowing for the detection of lower concentrations of metabolites [27,28,29]. Indirect, selective proton‐observed carbon‐edited (selPOCE) MRS sequences have been employed in vivo in animals and in the human brain and have been shown to detect13C‐labeled Glu and Gln separately [27,30,31]. Even at 7 T, the partial overlap of Glu and Gln1H resonances (Glu‐H4 resonates at ~2.3 ppm and Gln‐H4 resonates at ~2.4 ppm) poses challenges for their separate detection [32]. To achieve complete separation of Glu and Gln in the frontal region of the brain at 7 T, Jacobs et al. demonstrated that selPOCE is necessary [33].

In this study, we aim to assess the reproducibility of the measurement of13C‐labeled Glu and Gln in the human brain using selPOCE‐MRS at 7 T.

The study received approval from the Medical Ethical Committee NedMec, based in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Prior to participation, informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in the study.

Four healthy male adults (age 23 ± 2.2 years) underwent1H‐[13C]‐MRS in a 7‐T MR system (Philips, Best, NL) on two occasions. The two visits were scheduled between 3 and 4 weeks to allow for a washout period. A nonshielded13C‐transmit–receive birdcage head coil with eight transmit–receive1H‐dipole antennas and a 32‐channel1H‐receive array (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA) was used, as described in more detail by Jacobs et al. [33,34].

Participants were domiciled overnight and fasted for 8 h before each scan. Participants refrained from consuming caffeinated beverages or xanthine‐containing products for 12 h and alcohol for 24 h before each scan. Smoking and/or the use of nicotine/nicotine‐containing products was not permitted from the moment of inclusion until the last visit of the participant. Participants also avoided unaccustomed strenuous physical activity for 4 days before each scan.

Throughout the study, all participants were monitored by trained staff. Upon arrival, intravenous (IV) catheters were placed in both arms: one for [U‐13C]‐glucose administration and one for blood sampling. The arm with the IV catheter for blood sampling was wrapped in a heating pad (~37°C), and between samplings, a continuous NaCl drip was used to discourage blood clotting, thus allowing continuous blood sampling during the duration of the scan. Blood samples were collected every 5–6 min for immediate determination of plasma glucose levels using a benchtop glucose analyzer (YSI 2500 series, Yellow Spring Instruments Inc.). Remaining blood plasma was stored at −80°C for a maximum of 2 weeks for determination of13C fractional enrichment (FE) of plasma glucose. Blood plasma samples (540 mL) with the addition of 50 mL of D2O (deuterium oxide) were centrifuged for 4 min at 14,000 RPM. Subsequently, the samples were measured in a 5‐mm NMR tube on a 600‐MHz Bruker spectrometer [35] to determine the plasma glucose FE.

Both B1+and B0shimming were performed prior to1H‐[13C]‐MRS using the MR Code software (Tesla DC, Zaltbommel, the Netherlands). Relative complex transmit B1+fields per channel (multislice gradient‐echo acquisition [FFE], echo time [TE] = 1.89 ms, repetition time [TR] = 30 ms, three slices, slice thickness 10 mm) and B0maps (FFE, TE = 1.74 ms, ∆ TE = 1 ms, TR = 10 ms) were measured. For each subject, a specific RF‐shim setting was achieved by optimizing the transmit phases of the eight1H‐dipole antennas, aiming at constructive interference within a manually delineated region of interest (ROI) bifrontal in the midline. Second‐order B0shimming was performed in the manually drawn ROI bifrontal in the midline; the whole brain was considered as a secondary ROI, albeit with a lower weight. The13C power was calibrated prior to each scan using a [2‐13C]‐acetate phantom. A T1‐weighted image (3D TFE; voxel size: 0.5 × 0.5 × 1 mm3; TE: 1.9 ms; TR: 8 ms) was acquired to position the1H‐[13C]‐MRS voxel following the B1+and B0shimming.

A selPOCE‐stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence [27,33] was used for dynamic detection of the H4 of Glu and Gln signals and H3 of Glx (Glu and Gln combined), in a voxel bifrontal in the midline (see Figure2for an example) (scan time 6:40 min, minimal voxel size 3 × 5 × 3 cm; TE 7.8 ms; TM 38 ms; TR 3000 ms; NSA 4 × 32; VAPOR water suppression, BW 4000 Hz; 2048 spectral points). The selPOCE‐STEAM sequence consisted of four acquisitions: (1) conventional STEAM; (2)13C‐inversion, using a composite13C 90°–180°–90° block pulse centered at 32.95 ppm, that is, in between the C4 resonances of Glu and Gln; (3 and 4)13C Glu and Gln phase discrimination achieved with13C 90° (+x)–1H 180°–13C 90° (± x) block pulses, also centered at 32.95 ppm [33]. A surface spoiler coil was used to suppress residual signals from extracranial lipids [36]; this crusher coil was activated during the last STEAM pulse in all four selPOCE‐STEAM acquisitions. The selPOCE‐STEAM acquisition started just before the start of the [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion and lasted for approximately 120 min thereafter.

The resonance frequencies of the C3 of Glx and H4s of Glu and Gln are indicated with green, blue, and red dotted lines, respectively. The MRS voxel was placed bifrontal in the midline.

After these preparations and the acquisition of a baseline selPOCE‐STEAM dataset, the infusion protocol started with an initial bolus of 99% enriched [U‐13C]‐glucose, administered in a time‐dependent decreasing dose (based on the subject's height and weight, the duration of total [U‐13C]‐glucose administration is therefore different per subject) every minute during the first 15 min, and has been kept at a constant rate between 15 and 20 min of the [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion [26]. Following this, the infusion protocol included about a 100‐min continuous infusion of 66% enriched [U‐13C]‐glucose with 33% unlabeled glucose, depending on the subject's height and weight, allowing the concentration of plasma glucose to decline slowly while aiming at maintaining a constant FE of13C‐glucose. The infusion was adjusted based on the plasma glucose values with the aim of maintaining them between 6 and 10 mmol/L [37]. The total [U‐13C]‐glucose dose for all participants was 40 g in 250 mL of NaCl. For the second experiment, the plasma glucose values from the first experiment were taken into account to ensure that the plasma glucose values remained as consistent as possible between both experiments.

MRS data of 401H‐receive channels were combined using a generalized least squares algorithm, utilizing the unsuppressed water signal from the initial selPOCE‐STEAM acquisition (i.e., before the [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion started) to calculate the coil sensitivity for each channel. Subsequently, spectra were aligned for both frequency and phase before averaging [6]. The infusion of [U‐13C]glucose results in the labeling of [4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln during the first turn of the TCA cycle. With subsequent cycle turns, further labeling can occur, resulting in [3,4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln, [2,4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln, [1,4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln, [2,3,4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln, [1,3,4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln, and [1,2,3,4,5‐13C]Glu/Gln. The acquisition parameters were optimized to detect Glu and Gln labels at 4 and 5 positions. For simplicity, Glu and Gln labeled at the 4 and 5 positions are referred to as Glu C45 and Gln C45, respectively, and collectively as Glx C45. Glu C45, Gln C45, and Glx C3 signals in the difference spectra were fitted with a home‐written LCModel approach in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) using spectral simulations performed in SpinWizard software (R.A. de Graaf). Time courses of the fitted Glu C45 and Gln C45 signals were normalized to the average amplitude of Glu C45 in the final ~30 min of each experiment (steady state).

For each13C‐Glu and13C‐Gln measurement, an exponential function was fitted to estimate the plateau value. TheEarlyLateenrichment (RaveragePlateau) for13C‐Glu was calculated as the ratio of the slope from early 0 to 40 min divided by the Glu plateau [38]. TheMidLateenrichment for (RaveragePlateau)13C Gln was calculated as the ratio of the slope from 35 to 85 min divided by the Gln plateau, because of the slower increase of13C‐Gln compared to13C‐Glu.

To gain further insight into the stability of the MRS data over these > 2‐h scan sessions, the coefficient of variation (CoV) of tNAA (N‐acetyl aspartate [NAA] + N‐acetylaspartylglutamate [NAAG]) in the conventional STEAM spectra during [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion was determined by calculating the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the tNAA concentration across each scan. For this, the conventional STEAM spectra (i.e., Acquisition 1) were fitted with LCModel Version 6.1 [39].

One of the participants was excluded from the analysis because of significant head movements during the first visit and premature discontinuation of the second visit, leading to data fromN= 3 subjects for analysis.13C‐FE of plasma glucose in Participant 1 (first visit) and the first data points13C‐FE of plasma glucose of Participant 3 (second visit) could not be determined because of insufficient water suppression.

There was a rapid increase of plasma glucose concentrations and plasma glucose13C‐FE of all three participants during the first 20 min of the [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion, followed by a steady state of13C FE around 50% until the end of the infusion (Figure1). The variation in13C‐FE of plasma glucose between test and retest was 2.36% ± 1.12% (mean ± SD). Plasma glucose concentrations gradually decreased after approximately 1 h of [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion. After the [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion stopped, plasma glucose values returned to their baseline value within ± 20 min (Figure1).

Postinfusion plasma glucose measurements were acquired after ~20 min. Data of 1 T in (B) could not be determined because of insufficient water suppression.

Figure2shows the selPOCE difference spectra from one participant as an example, and fitting results of this dataset can be found in FigureS1. The mean linewidth across all subjects and timepoints of the STEAM‐MRS (as reported by the LCModel) was 11.22 ± 1.28 Hz. Glu C45 and Gln C45 signals can be observed, as well as the overlapping resonances of Glx C3.RSlopePlateaufor the Glu test and retest was similar (mean ± SD: 0.014 ± 0.002 vs. 0.012 ± 0.003) with an overall test/retest variability of 15.8% ± 3.76% (mean ± SD), and individual subject variances were as follows: Sub 1 (1.9%), Sub 2 (26%), and Sub 3 (19%). For Gln,RSlopePlateaufor test and retest was similar as well (mean ± SD: 0.007 ± 0.008 vs. 0.006 ± 0.007); however, test/retest variability was higher as expected because of the lower concentration of Gln: 33.3% ± 13.66% (mean ± SD), and individual subject variances were as follows: Sub 1 (25%), Sub 2 (37%), and Sub 3 (38%) (Figure3).

This study investigated the reproducibility of the determination of13C‐labeling of Glu and Gln in the healthy human brain during [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion using selPOCE‐MRS at 7 T. Plasma glucose concentrations and13C FE of plasma glucose rose rapidly in all participants within the first 20 min of [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion, stabilizing a plasma glucose13C FE of around 50% throughout the remaining infusion period. The variation in plasma glucose13C FE between initial and subsequent measurements was 2.36% ± 1.12%. We observed that the mean time courses of Glu C45 and Gln C45 enrichment in the brain were similar for test/retest scans with a variability of 15.8% ± 3.76% for Glu C45 and a higher variability of 33.3% ± 13.66% for Gln C45.

As expected, the test/retest variability of Gln C45 was higher compared to the test/retest variability of Glu C45, as a result of the inherently lower SNR due to the lower concentration of Gln and slower labeling of Gln C45 compared to Glu C45 [40,41]. Care was taken to obtain similar plasma glucose levels during [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion per subject for test and retest visits. Furthermore, subjects were domiciled the night prior to each scan to ensure compliance with fasting and lifestyle instructions to guarantee similar testing conditions during the test and retest. Previous dynamic13C‐MRS studies, utilizing either direct or indirect13C‐MRS, have reported13C‐enrichment percentages in the brain after approximately 100 min of13C‐glucose infusion, ranging from 25% to 65% for Glu and from 20% to 40% for Gln among healthy participants [40,41]. In previous studies, as reviewed by Petroff et al. [15], the concentration of Gln C4 was significantly increased by 54% in epilepsy patients compared to controls (0.60 vs. 0.39 μmol/g). Similarly, in Alzheimer's disease, the Glu enrichment ratio was reduced by 30% (0.53 vs. 0.76 in controls) [42,43]. Knowing the reproducibility for the determination of the labeling of Glu C45 and Gln C45 will help in the design of13C‐MRS studies comparing, for example, placebo versus intervention or healthy versus diseased [25,40].

To enhance our understanding of the stability of our MRS measurements, we determined the stability of the tNAA signal, measured with the conventional STEAM acquisition (i.e.,1H‐MRS), assuming that the concentration of tNAA is unaffected by the infusion of [U‐13C]‐glucose [23,44]. During our > 120‐min scan session, we observed a CoV of ~8%, which is slightly higher compared to existing literature, typically reporting a CoV of less than 5% for tNAA [45,46]. Although we utilized a larger voxel size, which would typically reduce SNR, the extended scan duration during [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion likely increased subject movement, which may have contributed to the higher variability. This is also relevant for studies considering the use of straight1H‐MRS to monitor13C incorporation, in which a conversion from the primary resonance structure to one with satellites is monitored during [U‐13C]‐glucose infusion [41,47].

The strengths of this study include the use of a13C‐transmit–receive birdcage head coil, enabling a uniform RF excitation throughout our ROI, and our effort to ensure similar testing conditions during both visits. There are, however, several limitations as well. Given the high cost of13C‐labeled substrates and time‐consuming experiments (i.e., typically > 2 h), human13C‐MRS studies are often carried out in small samples [3,39,40]. Also, in our study, we experienced this significant limitation arising from the restricted number of participants. In addition, we had to exclude one of the participants from our analysis because of substantial head movements during the MRI scan of the first visit and an inadvertently shortened second visit.

We have investigated the reproducibility of selPOCE‐MRS at 7 T for detection of Glu C45 and Gln C45 in the human brain, bifrontal in the midline upon [U‐13C]‐labeled glucose infusion. The mean time courses of Glu C45 and Gln C45 were similar between runs, with a variability of 15.8% ± 3.76% for Glu and a higher variability of 33.3% ± 13.66% for Gln. Knowing the variability associated with these measurements can aid in the future application of this method in studying disease‐specific alterations in Glu/Gln neurotransmitter cycling. Such investigations hold promise for elucidating the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of various conditions related to disrupted Glu/Gln metabolism.
