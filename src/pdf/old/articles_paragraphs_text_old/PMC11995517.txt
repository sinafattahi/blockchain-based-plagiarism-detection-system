A total of 3000 1‐day‐old chicks were randomly assigned to 5 groups with 6 replicates (n= 100). The control group was fed standard diets, whereas the other groups were fed diets containing poultry slaughterhouse meal (PSM) at levels of 50, 75, 100 or 125 kg/t. The results indicated that the group fed 75 kg/t of PSM exhibited greater body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) than the other groups. Enhanced crude protein (CP), calcium and phosphorus digestibility coefficients were observed in the 75 kg/t PSM group. Compared with those in the control group, liver weight was increased, plasma high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) was increased, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) was decreased in all the PSM groups. The remaining biochemical parameters showed non‐significant changes, except for the serum albumin and globulin levels, which were significantly lower in the PSM groups, except for the globulin level in the 100 kg group. Moreover, liver malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased, and catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased in the 75 kg/t PSM group. Mild degenerative changes in hepatocytes were observed, indicating the potential benefits of PSM inclusion. In conclusion, incorporating PSM in broiler diets holds promise for improving the health and productivity of broilers by enhancing the growth performance, digestibility, plasma lipids and antioxidative status of these birds.

Chicken production and the poultry feed industry are faced with significant challenges due to high costs and shortages of protein and energy supplies. The previous research has focused on developing substitute feed sources to augment the limited supply of conventional feed resources. Although several unconventional chicken feed sources have grown in popularity, there are currently little data and analyses regarding their nutritional composition, which limits their use. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate how these unconventional compounds use energy and minerals. According to some experts, poultry slaughterhouse meal (PSM) is a byproduct of poultry processing facilities that include vital elements like calcium, phosphorus, vitamin B12 and key amino acids. As the poultry industry grows, PSM has the potential to be a useful substitute for other protein components like meat and bone meal and soybean meal. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding PSMs to broiler chickens in terms of growth performance, digestibility, antioxidant status and liver histology.

Chicken production and the poultry feed industry are faced with significant challenges due to high costs and shortages of protein and energy supplies. The previous research has focused on developing substitute feed sources to augment the limited supply of conventional feed resources. Although several unconventional chicken feed sources have grown in popularity, there are currently little data and analyses regarding their nutritional composition, which limits their use. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate how these unconventional compounds use energy and minerals (Dahouda et al.2009; Ružić‐Muslić et al.2014).

According to some experts, poultry slaughterhouse meal (PSM) is a byproduct of poultry processing facilities that includes vital elements like calcium, phosphorus, vitamin B12 and key amino acids (Waldroup and Adams1994; Abdel‐Warith et al.2001). As the poultry industry grows, PSM has the potential to be a useful substitute for other protein components like meat and bone meal and soybean meal. PSM is a material with a lot of variation. The connective tissues provide the majority of the protein. The average amount of crude protein (CP) was 61%. The amount of fat in PSM is determined by the raw ingredients as well as the processing technique, especially if the meat chickens have a lot of abdominal fat (Evans1985). As a result, the fat content varies greatly but is mostly unsaturated fatty acids (New1987; NRA1993). PSM has just chyme crude fibre and foot keratin as its sources of crude fibre.

Because consumers are favouring processed poultry meat over entire carcasses, the ash content varies greatly and could continue to climb, resulting in more bones going to the offal (NRA1993). PBM is an excellent source of zinc, iron and choline. The type and quality of the raw materials, the processing temperature, the use of antioxidants to maintain the raw materials’ quality, the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, the high polyamine content, the imbalance of amino acids, the digestibility and content of the nutrients, and the storage conditions are just a few of the variables that can significantly affect the results when PSM are fed to broilers (Bellaver et al.2001). None of the other performance parameters that were evaluated were impacted by the PBM treatment approaches. During the same time period, broiler performance did not change appreciably when PSM was added to the diets (Sartorelli1998; Junqueira et al.1992). There was no discernible difference in the performance of 21‐day‐old broilers between diets that included 4% meat and bone meal, 3% poultry offal meal and vegetable diets (Bellaver et al.2005). When compared to diets that contained simply soybean meal, broilers fed diets that also included meat and bone meal, poultry offal meal or a combination of these three nutrients showed superior BW and feed conversion ratio (FCR) at 21 days of age. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding PSMs to broiler chickens in terms of growth performance, digestibility, antioxidant status and liver histology.

A total of 3000 1‐day‐old Cobb broiler chicks, with an average weight of approximately 42.1 ± 0.2 g, were distributed among five nutritional groups. Each treatment included 6 replicates, with 100 birds per replicate. The experiment spanned 35 days that were randomly allocated to 5 dietary groups.

The birds were fed three dietary phases: starter (1–10 days), grower (11–23 days) and finisher (24–35 days). The starter diets were crumbled, whereas the grower and finisher diets were pellets. The experiment took place in an environmentally controlled house, with the temperature adjusted from 32°C ± 1°C, decreased by 1°C every 3 days until it reached 24°C ± 1°C and maintained until the conclusion of the experiment (35 days). The relative humidity started at 70% and then was maintained at approximately 50%. The lighting schedule included 16 h of light with 8 h dark period for the initial 3 days, followed by an intermittent lighting programme of 16 h of light with 8 h of darkness until the study's conclusion. Regular monitoring ensured the birds’ health status, and mortality rates were recorded daily.

The birds were assigned to five groups. Group A was fed an experimental basal diet formulated based on the nutritional requirements of the Cobb broilers (Aviagen2018). The B, C, D and E diets contained 50, 75, 100 and 125 kg/t PSM, respectively. The inedible parts of poultry slaughterhouse byproduct meal include feathers, bones, blood, skin, fat and connective tissue, all of which contribute to its nutritional composition and influence digestibility, mineral content and energy balance in broiler diets (Tables1,2,3). Commercial PSM samples were subjected to chemical analysis, revealing 60% CP, 3600 kcal/kg metabolizable energy, 6.5% calcium, 3.8% total phosphorus, 10.5% crude fat (CF), 2.2% crude fibre, 0.70% sodium, 0.75% chloride, 6.0% lysine, 1.7% methionine and 0.2% threonine.

BW was recorded weekly, and feed intake (FI) was measured daily on a group basis. Body weight gain (BWG) and the FCR were calculated. At the end of the experiment, 24 birds per group were slaughtered, and the carcass, breast muscle, thigh muscle, abdominal fat and internal organ weights were recorded and expressed as a ratio to BW (Saleh et al.2023).

During the final 3 days of the investigation, excreta from each cage replicate were collected and weighed for digestibility testing. All samples were dried for 24 h at 60°C in a drying oven following the digestibility test. The dried samples were then homogenized in their entirety according to AOAC (2003) for scrutiny and finely ground. The Kjeldahl method was used to determine the nitrogen digestibility of the CP component in the feed and excreta (CP, Method 968.06). An adiabatic bomb calorimeter was used to calculate gross energy (GallenkampAutobomb, London, UK) standardized with benzoic acid (AOAC2003). The digestibility of calcium and phosphorus minerals was measured following the method described by Bao et al. (2009). The values of crude fibre were determined following the method of Heteron and Jensen, based on the solubility of the noncellulosic components in solutions of sulphuric acid and potassium base (Churkova2013).

Malondialdehyde (MDA) was used to detect lipid peroxidation in the liver following Richard et al. (1992), and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GPX activities were determined according to the method of Marklund and Marklund (1974).

At 35 days of age, blood samples were collected from each group (n= 10 birds/group) following an 8‐h fasting period before euthanasia. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected from the wing vein immediately before slaughtering, gathered into heparinized test tubes and then rapidly centrifuged (3000 rpm for 20 min at 5°C) to separate the plasma. Plasma was stored at  −20°C pending analysis. Total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein, albumin and globulin were all measured colorimetrically using commercial kits (Diamond Diagnostics, Egypt) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Chicken liver tissue samples were swiftly procured and immediately preserved in 10% buffered formalin for 48 h to ensure proper fixation. Subsequently, the fixed specimens were processed with an automated tissue machine. In a sequential procedure, specimens were initially washed in distilled water for 30 min, followed by dehydration in a graded series of alcohol concentrations (70%, 90% and 100%). The specimens were then cleared of xylene after multiple changes, impregnated with molten paraffin wax and subsequently embedded and blocked. Multiple 4 µm thick sections were precision‐sliced and subjected to conventional haematoxylin and eosin staining (Dosoky et al.2022).

The data obtained were subjected to analysis using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test to evaluate the mean differences among treatments. Statistical analyses were performed utilizing SAS software (SAS Institute2016). Ap< 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

The growth performance of the broiler chickens over 35 days was assessed, and the results are presented in Table4. Birds fed 75 kg/t of PSM exhibited significantly greater BW and BWG than those in the control group (A) and other PSM groups (B, D and E), indicating improved performance (p< 0.05). The FI was significantly lower in the group receiving 125 kg/t of PSM than in the control group (p< 0.05). However, the FCR did not significantly differ across the experimental groups. However, group B (50 kg/t) had the best FCR.

Table5provides insights into digestibility, revealing that 75 kg of PSM powder significantly increased (89.8% ± 1.15%) CP digestibility in chickens. Conversely, the groups ingesting 50 or 100 kg of PSM exhibited greater CP digestibility than the control group, with a decrease observed in the 125 kg group. Similar trends were observed for CF digestibility, where the 50, 75 and 100 kg groups had higher percentages of CF digestibility than did the control group, whereas calcium digestibility increased in the groups consuming 75, 100 and 125 kg of PSM compared to the control group. Phosphorus digestibility was greater in all the treatment groups than in the control group.

Organ weights were evaluated (Table6), revealing various impacts on carcass, breast muscle, thigh muscle, liver, abdominal fat, heart, gizzard and spleen weights across treatment groups. For instance, compared with those in the control group, all the treated groups exhibited no significant changes in carcass, breast or thigh muscle weight, whereas liver weight did not significantly increase in any of the treatment groups. Abdominal fat, heart, gizzard and spleen weights also showed non‐significant changes.

Blood parameters, detailed in Table7, demonstrated alterations induced by different levels of PSM. Total cholesterol decreased, not significantly, in all treated groups except for the 100 kg PSM group. TG levels increased, not significantly, in the 50 and 125 kg PSM groups but decreased in the 75 and 100 kg groups. The remaining biochemical parameters showed non‐significant changes except albumin and globulin levels that were significantly decreased in the treated groups except globulin levels in the 100 kg group.

Table8highlights the impact of PSMs on tissue antioxidants. The MDA levels in all the PSM groups were lower than those in the control group, indicating reduced lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSPx) and SOD levels increased significantly in all the PSM groups compared to those in the control group.

Histopathological examination (Figure1) revealed distinct liver conditions across the dietary groups. The control diet (A) produced dilated central veins and hepatic vacuolation, indicating possible alterations in blood flow and metabolic stress. An amount of 50 kg (B) and 75 kg (C) of the PSMs displayed well‐arranged hepatocytes, suggesting normal liver function. However, the 100 kg (D) and 125 kg (E) PSM groups exhibited signs of liver deterioration, including slight degenerative changes and shrinkage, emphasizing potential structural impairment and metabolic stress.

The efficient utilization of dietary protein and amino acids in chickens is crucial for achieving environmental and economic goals (Salama et al.2024). To optimize dietary protein utilization, a dietary strategy maintaining an ideal protein‐to‐amino acid ratio is essential, considering factors such as genetic potential, environmental conditions, feed quality and gastrointestinal health (Adhikari et al.2020; Alagawany et al.2021). The study revealed improved BW and BWG in birds fed 75 kg/t of PSM, whereas 125 kg/t decreased FI, and 50 kg/t had the lowest FCR. However, the FCR did not significantly differ among the experimental groups. Maximizing dietary amino acids is economically important due to their high cost, and concerns about nitrogen losses from animal waste highlight the need for careful dietary management. Conclusive evidence suggests that increasing easily digestible amino acids enhances processing yields (Ahmed et al.2020; Maharjan et al.2020; Amer et al.2021).

The present study revealed that birds fed 75 kg/t of PSM exhibited greater CP digestibility, leading to improved BW and BWG (Zampiga et al.2021). Conversely, those fed 125 kg/t of PSM had the lowest CP digestibility, resulting in lower FI, BW and BWG. Similar trends were observed for CF digestibility, whereas the percentages of calcium and phosphorus digestibilities were greater in all the treated groups than in the control group. These findings emphasize the importance of carefully monitoring nitrogen levels in chicken manure (Alagawany et al.2019).

This research highlights a clear connection between dietary protein intake and nitrogen excretion, emphasizing the need for well‐balanced meals to enhance nitrogen utilization efficiency (Alagawany et al.2018). Birds fed 75 kg of PSM/t demonstrated improved CP digestibility, aligning with the importance of meeting broilers’ amino acid needs for well‐being and development. Efficient nitrogen conservation involves assessing factors such as readily absorbed amino acids, caloric intake, feeding methods and maintaining a balance between essential and non‐essential amino acids, as well as considering external feed supplements (Kidd et al.2021). Overall, the study supports previous findings, indicating that slaughterhouse waste products provide essential amino acids crucial for broiler growth and maturation (Karuppannan et al.2021; Castillo‐Paz et al.2022).

The study revealed variations in CF digestibility among the groups, with 50, 75 and 100 kg of PSM groups displaying higher percentages of CF digestibility than did the control, whereas the 125 kg group exhibited the lowest CF digestibility. Poultry fed to calory and the inclusion of calories in slaughterhouse waste in broiler diets may elevate caloric content, influenced by factors such as processing methods, bird age and health status. The digestibility of lipids in slaughterhouse waste diets is heterogeneous, with factors such as fat composition and anti‐nutritional components affecting utilization in poultry diets (Shen et al.2019; Pinotti and Ottoboni2021; Yessimbekov et al.2021).

This study highlights the suitability of slaughter byproducts due to their mineral content (Toldrá et al.2016; Adhikari et al.2018). Calcium digestibility increased in the groups consuming 75, 100 or 125 kg of PSM compared to the control group, whereas phosphorus digestibility was greater in all the PSM groups than in the control group. These byproducts, encompassing flesh and blood, provide crucial minerals such as calcium and phosphorus for bone and muscle health (Izydorczyk et al.2022). Research has underscored the importance of utilizing these organic leftovers, especially in animal fodder production (Irshad and Sharma2015).

Previous studies aligned with the current findings, revealing the beneficial utilization of PSMs in poultry nutrition (Adhikari et al.2018; Limeneh et al.2022). The nutritional quality and digestibility of slaughterhouse waste feeds are subject to various factors, such as feed processing methods, storage conditions and the specific composition of waste materials. It is imperative to adhere to established standards and regulations to guarantee the safety and quality of the feed (Ribeiro et al.2021).

Although carcass, breast and thigh muscle weights showed no significant differences compared to the control group, earlier research suggested that elevated feed availability could enhance development rates and increase carcass weights in broiler chickens (Ozdemir and Yetilmezsoy2019). The supplementation of broiler chicks’ diets with slaughterhouse waste offers additional protein and essential amino acids, potentially fostering muscular growth and overall body development and contributing to increased carcass weight.

The liver weight did not significantly increase in any of the treatment groups, whereas the abdominal fat weight exhibited a similar trend, except for in the 50 kg PSM group, which exhibited a lower weight than the control group. Liver hypertrophy may be attributed to increased protein synthesis and nutritional metabolism, as the liver is a metabolic organ (Mozhiarasi and Natarajan2022). The inclusion of blood and adipose tissues from slaughterhouses in the diet of broiler chickens may contribute to elevated fat content, leading to increased abdominal fat buildup and liver weight. The liver, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, can accumulate fat in response to higher dietary fat levels (Limeneh et al.2022).

Heart weights were not significantly lower in any of the groups, except in the 125 kg PSM group than in the control group. The reduction in cardiac muscle mass observed in broiler chicks fed slaughterhouse waste may be due to multiple contributing factors, including potential modifications in the diet content, particularly a heightened concentration of fat (Baldi et al.2021). Diets rich in fat have been linked to structural and functional changes in cardiac muscle. Additionally, the increased strain on the heart due to rapid growth and higher BW in broiler chickens may lead to proportional changes in cardiac muscle mass (Sayeed and Tiwari2020).

The treated groups exhibited a non‐significant decrease in blood cholesterol and an increase in TG levels, with exceptions noted in the 100 kg PSM group, which showed the reverse trend and in the 75 kg group, which displayed decreased TGs. Slaughterhouse waste, known for its unique fatty acid composition, may contribute to reduced total cholesterol levels due to its polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid contents (Cartoni Mancinelli et al.2022). The diverse lipid content of waste, including omega‐3 fatty acids, could also lead to lowered TG levels (Saleh et al.2024). Additionally, non‐digestible fibre in slaughterhouse waste may inhibit cholesterol absorption, further contributing to lower total cholesterol levels (Siddiqui et al.2022). The high‐quality protein in slaughterhouse waste may influence lipid metabolism, potentially resulting in decreased TGs (Sharma et al.2021).

The treated groups exhibited increased HDL levels and decreased LDL levels, attributed to the specific lipid composition, including omega‐3 fatty acids, in slaughterhouse waste (Cattaneo et al.2023). Additionally, proteins in slaughterhouse waste were found to positively influence lipid metabolism, contributing to the observed changes in HDL and LDL levels (Yaakob et al.2021).

The treated groups showed non‐significant decreases in serum uric acid and creatinine levels, which are byproducts of purine degradation that are primarily eliminated through the renal system. Slaughterhouse waste, which is rich in meat and blood, serves as a valuable protein source, and elevated protein intake from such waste may reduce uric acid levels (Shuaib et al.2023). This reduction may indicate improved kidney function, supported by minerals and bioactive compounds in the waste, relieving kidney oxidative stress and inflammation (Song et al.2022; Montalbán et al.2023). Slaughterhouse waste is integrated into the diet as a nutritionally rich source of proteins, minerals and essential components, potentially enhancing overall nutrition and supporting kidney health (Javourez et al.2021).

The treated groups exhibited a significant reduction in the serum albumin concentration. Slaughterhouse waste may lead to blood dilution, resulting in decreased total protein and albumin levels. The distinctive protein composition of slaughterhouse waste, characterized by variations in amino acid content and degradability, can influence protein production and metabolism in broiler chickens. Specific protein fractions within the waste may contribute to the observed decline in total protein and albumin levels (Cappelaere et al.2021; Garazhian et al.2023; Saleh and El‐Magd2018,2019).

The treated groups exhibited non‐significant reductions in the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST levels. Incorporating liver and organ tissues from slaughterhouses into diets offers essential nutrients and cofactors that promote liver health. The various components in these waste products may possess hepatoprotective effects, contributing to decreased levels of liver enzymes. The essential proteins, vitamins and minerals present in waste support proper liver function. Ensuring an optimal intake of a diverse array of nutrients may positively impact liver health, leading to a decrease in liver enzyme levels (Limeneh et al.2022; Saleh et al.2020).

The PSM‐treated groups exhibited significantly lower MDA levels and greater CAT, GSPx and SOD levels than the control group, indicating the antioxidant potential of slaughterhouse waste. Waste, comprising blood, flesh and bones, contains bioactive substances such as vitamins (E and C), minerals (selenium and zinc) and phytochemicals, effectively reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, as reflected by decreased MDA levels (Sayas‐Barberá et al.2022). Additionally, the antioxidants in waste may enhance the activity of intrinsic antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT and GPx. These findings align with previous studies (Alagawany and Abd El‐Hack2020; Carvalho et al.2020; Haščík et al.2022; Ameen et al.2023; Saikia et al.2023).

Numerous antioxidants are present in living tissues to counteract oxidants. However, oxidative stress is indicated when the body's balance between antioxidants and oxidants is disturbed and oxidants surpass a certain threshold. Living cells’ mitochondria produce the majority of oxidants during cellular metabolism. ROS are generated not only by cellular metabolic activities but also by some external sources, such as feed that contains oxidized lipids and fats (Cadenas and Davies2000). The principal source of ROS is the release of electrons during oxidative phosphorylation from the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Mujahid et al.2007). Because the electron transport chain is essential to the muscle's ability to produce energy, high environmental temperatures upregulate the generation of ROS. Decreased protein synthesis, accelerated muscle ageing and the inactivation of nuclear proteins are all possible consequences of increased ROS release (Celi and Gabai2015). Elevated ROS concentrations rise in stressful environmental conditions, causing the chicken physiology to struggle to maintain thermal homeostasis (Sahin et al.2016). Excessive production of ROS can cause poor nutrient absorption and digestion, which alter the redox status of the intestinal mucosa and cause the antioxidant system to malfunction, as was previously mentioned (Liu et al.2014). Moreover, OS damages the mucosa of the intestines, impairs the effectiveness of digestion and nutrient absorption and negatively affects the average growth of animals (Yara et al.2013). Under OS, the body produces and releases heat shock proteins (HSP) in an attempt to protect itself from the harmful effects of ROS on cells (Archana et al.2017).

The antioxidants found in slaughterhouse waste are essential for maintaining a balance between the generation of ROS and the antioxidant defence system in broiler chickens. This equilibrium contributes to cellular well‐being, reduces oxidative stress and improves the efficiency of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT and GSPx. These enzymes play a crucial role in counteracting ROS and protecting cells from oxidative damage, as evidenced by the enhanced histopathological profile. These observations are supported by previous studies (Scutaru2020; Salem et al.2022).

Antioxidant status in broilers, as determined by several antioxidant enzymes, including CAT, SOD, GPx and MDA, has been considered the first line of defensive biomarkers to protect cells and tissues from oxidative damage caused by some free radicals such as superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH) (Zheng et al.2019). GSPx, GPx is an important antioxidant enzyme showing strong radical‐scavenging capacity against free radicals and lipid peroxides. The present study detected a significantly lower activity of GPx in the serum of broilers fed with PSM, which may due to the lower levels ofn‐3 LC‐PUFA and DHA in 100% PSM diet. Liu et al. (2015) reported that broilers are susceptible to oxidative stress due to their high demand for LC‐PUFA. However, elevated serum GPx activity in broilers fed 100% PSM might be due to the antioxidant capacity of broiler protein. It has been reported that the GPx activity is well correlated with the concentration of MDA (Sabzi et al.2017). MDA is a natural biomarker and main ending product of lipid peroxidation, and its elevation indicates oxidative injury and associates with the pathological state of animals, including cell structure damage and function. A lower activity of GPx with the higher level of MDA indicates that PSM‐based diet may provoke the oxidative damage of broilers which was further proven by the presence of hepatocyte lipid vacuolization (Nugroho2014).

The vision and suggestions reached by the current study agree with dos Santos Pereira et al. (2024), who said: Understanding what legislation seeks when applying different quality standards for certain purposes is extremely important for environmental and public health safety. The data reported in the article brings the main standards applied in the world in this regard and demonstrates how to adapt to them through different wastewater treatment techniques, especially from slaughterhouses that generate and consume a large volume of effluent and water, in addition to presenting the limiting factors associated with wastewater management and generating attitudes using this study as tool.

Our study indicated that including PSM in broiler diets, particularly at 75 kg/t, positively influences growth performance, digestibility and antioxidant status. The observed improvements in BW, FCR and nutrient digestibility highlight the potential of PSM as cost‐effective and sustainable protein source. This study emphasizes the need for careful dietary optimization, considering factors such as nitrogen levels, amino acid balance and adherence to safety standards. The positive impact on lipid metabolism and organ health further supports the potential benefits of incorporating PSMs in broiler nutrition, as these supplements could contribute to both economic and environmental sustainability.
