The increase in world population linked to climate change leads to the need to develop more productive and more adapted cultivars of food species. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping is a useful tool although, interaction between genotype and the environment is still a challenge. In this study, we sought to identify QTL related to grain yield and the production components in common beans (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) supported by QTL×environment interaction. Two hundred eight recombinant inbred lines obtained from the Awauna UEM×IPR88 Uirapuru common bean cross were evaluated in 2017, 2018, and 2019 in field conditions under a 15 × 15 triple lattice experimental design. QTL mapping was estimated using genotypic means and a genetic linkage map with 288 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Five QTLs associated with plant height (PH), number of pods per plant (NPP), first pod height (FPH), 100‐seed weight (SW), and grain yield per plant (GYP) were identified on chromosomes Pv01, Pv04, Pv08, and Pv10. Interestingly, three of these QTLs were co‐localized for more than one trait, where the QTL for PH, NPP, and GYP co‐locate on Pv01, the QTL for PH and FPH co‐locate on Pv04, and the QTL for NPP and SW co‐locate on Pv08. In turn, on Pv10, two distinct QTLs were found for SW. The identification of these QTLs stands out in Brazil since relatively little research is directed at this economically important commercial group. It is noteworthy that the molecular markers found linked to the QTLs must later be validated to be used in a multi‐trait marker‐assisted selection.

According to projections, the global population is expected to reach 10.9 billion by the year 2100. As a result, various sectors of society are increasingly focused on achieving food security. A key implication of this population increase is a greater demand for agricultural expansion, which requires more intensive land use. This shift calls for the adaptation of existing crop varieties or the development of new, more productive cultivars to meet the growing food needs (Garrett et al.,2018).

Climate change requires the development of cultivars that can adapt to diverse and changing environmental conditions. The common bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) is an important crop with significant nutritional benefits. It provides essential amino acids, complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, unsaturated fats, vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, it contains bioactive compounds with potential health benefits, including hypocholesterolemic, antiatherogenic, anticarcinogenic, and hypoglycemic properties (Celmeli et al.,2018; Kotue et al.,2018).

One of the major challenges faced by plant breeding programs is the variation in genotype performance across different environments, commonly referred to as genotype by environment interaction (G × E interaction; Singamsetti et al.,2021). Identifying the underlying causes of G × E interaction and integrating this knowledge into breeding strategies requires extensive multi‐environment experiments, which demand large sample populations and considerable financial investment (A. A. Elias et al.,2016).

Mapping studies identify genomic regions using molecular markers (Kromdijk et al.,2014). Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping in plants helps uncover the inheritance patterns and genetic architecture of quantitative traits, aiding the identification of functional markers that can be used for selecting complex traits (Bernardo,2008). However, most identified QTLs account for less than half of the total genetic variation; this can be attributed to the presence of numerous undetected minor QTL and epistatic interactions within the mapping process (Boopathi,2020). As a result, the interaction between QTL and environmental factors (QTL × E interaction) involves additional complexity, requiring more advanced statistical approaches to accurately assess and quantify these effects (Kromdijk et al.,2014).

Several researchers have made significant contributions to mapping QTL in common beans. González et al. (2016) identified important QTL for plant height (PH) and the number of pods per plant (NPP) on chromosome Pv01. Similarly, Delfini et al. (2021) found QTLs associated with PH, the NPP, and 100‐seed weight (SW) on Pv01, as well as QTL for PH and the height of the first pod on Pv04. Langat et al. (2019) focused on mapping QTL related to drought tolerance in an F2population of common beans. They found QTL for the NPP on Pv01, QTL for SW on Pv08 and Pv10, and QTL for grain yield on Pv01. Mir et al. (2021) identified QTL for the NPP on Pv01 and Pv08, QTL for SW on Pv08 and Pv10, and QTL for grain yield per plant (GYP) on Pv01. These studies collectively highlight chromosome Pv01 as a significant locus for traits related to PH, the number of pods, and grain yield, with other QTL identified on chromosomes Pv04, Pv08, and Pv10. Cordoba‐Novoa et al. (2022) conducted an investigation for the genetic variability and structural characteristics of traits related to transpiration, stomatal regulation, and water utilization within Mesoamerican common bean germplasm. They successfully identified QTLs on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv07, as well as candidate genes and regulatory elements associated with tolerance to abiotic stress, including various transcription factors. Arriagada et al. (2023) performed a meta‐QTL (MQTL) analysis encompassing 667 QTLs derived from 21 distinct studies with the aim of discerning reliable genomic regions linked to yield‐related traits in common bean. Their comprehensive analysis unveiled 42 MQTLs, characterized by confidence intervals that were 3.41 times more precise than those of the original QTL, thereby enhancing the accuracy of mapping. Notably, among these MQTLs, 28 were correlated with both yield and phenological traits, highlighting their significant potential applicability in breeding programs. In a similar vein, Njau et al. (2024) identified 44 QTLs pertinent to pod quality and yield traits within a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population originating from a Vanilla × MCM5001 snap × dry bean cross. The QTLs associated with pod quality were localized on chromosomes Pv01, Pv02, Pv03, Pv04, Pv06, and Pv07, whereas those associated with pod yield were discerned on chromosome Pv08.

Traits controlled by multiple loci are often heavily influenced by environmental factors, making it crucial to assess QTL responses across various environments (A. A. Elias et al.,2016). QTL analysis allows researchers to determine the number and location of key genetic regions, as well as to explore the interactions among loci and identify essential genes and their functions (Li et al.,2015). Yuste‐Lisbona et al. (2014) discovered five QTLs with only individual additive effects, six with only epistatic effects, and 12 that exhibited both types of effects for pod traits. Hoyos‐Villegas et al. (2016) conducted a study over two agricultural years and identified QTL associated with seed yield, seed size, days to flowering, days to maturity, number of seeds, and PH.

Sandhu et al. (2018) evaluated an RIL population at two locations in southern Manitoba over the years 2014–2016 and found QTL associated with seed hydration and hardness, traits that impact cooking quality. Geravandi et al. (2020) identified QTL linked to seed size and yield‐related traits. González et al. (2016) evaluated an RIL population across various environments and identified QTL that control the number of days to flowering as a function of increasing degree‐days. J. C. F. Elias et al. (2021) examined RILs grown under both drought and non‐drought conditions for 2 years and identified 16 QTLs across chromosomes Pv01, Pv02, Pv03, Pv05, Pv07, Pv08, Pv09, Pv10, and Pv11. These studies highlight the complex genetic basis of common bean traits, demonstrating the presence of both single‐locus and epistatic QTL and the importance of environmental interaction. They also underscore the need for multi‐environmental studies to capture the full range of QTL effects, which is critical for plant breeding and the development of improved cultivars.

The present study aimed to map QTL related to production components, as well as interaction between QTL and the environment within a RIL population of black common bean derived from a cross between Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru.

Genetic mapping of Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru population of black common bean.

In this study, common bean RILs were generated via artificial intragenic (Mesoamerican) hybridizations between the cultivars Awauna UEM (female) and IPR88 Uirapuru (male) within a controlled greenhouse environment at the Núcleo de Pesquisa Aplicada à Agricultura (Nupagri‐UEM). A total of 208 progenies were produced using the Single Seed Descent method, progressing through generations until reaching the F2:5stage. Subsequently, the RIL population (F2:6, F2:7, and F2:8) underwent phenotypic evaluations in field conditions at Centro de Treinamento em Irrigação (CTI‐UEM). Both facilities are part of the Universidade Estadual de Maringá‐UEM, situated in Maringá, in the Northwestern region of the state of Paraná, Brazil.

Awauna UEM is a black common bean cultivar product of the Nupagri‐UEM Common Bean Breeding Program. It derives from the crossing of the cultivar FT Nobre and the SEL 1308 line. Noteworthy characteristics of this cultivar include an average maturation period of 71 days from emergence to harvest, resistance to lodging, and a yield potential of 3400 kg ha−1, particularly suited for the southern region of the country. Moreover, it exhibits resistance to angular leaf spot (Pseudocercospora griseola), common bean mosaic virus (BCMV), and most of the Brazilian endemic races ofColletotrichum lindemuthianum, owing to the presence of theCo‐42anthracnose resistance allele.

IPR88 Uirapuru, a member of the black commercial group of common bean cultivars, is the result of breeding efforts of the Common Bean Improvement Program of the Agronomic Institute of Paraná. Its genetic lineage traces back to a combination of traditional cultivars, including BAC 29, PR1711/3, NEP2/2, Puebla 173, and ICA Pijao. Phenotypically, IPR88 Uirapuru exhibits wide adaptability across the primary production regions of Paraná, with optimal size for mechanical harvesting, an average growth cycle of 86 days, and a yield potential of 2407 kg ha−1. Additionally, it demonstrates tolerance to water deficit and high temperatures. Furthermore, it is resistant to BCMV, rust (Uromyces phaseoli), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni) (Moda‐Cirino et al.,2001).

A total of 208 RILs, the parent varieties Awauna UEM and IPR88 Uirapuru, and control cultivars, including BRS Esteio, FT Noble, FT Soberano, FT 120, Crioulo, and CHP996524, were evaluated. These assessments spanned three agricultural years, from August to November of 2017, 2018, and 2019, within the experimental fields of CTI‐UEM. Each experimental unit comprised a 2.0 m row, spaced 0.5 m apart, accommodating 24 plants. The experimental design was a triple lattice arrangement of 15×15.

The following agronomic traits were evaluated: PH: the distance from the soil surface to the tip of the leaves measured in centimeters; NPP: calculated as the total number of pods per plot divided by the number of plants within the plot; number of seeds per pod (NSP): determined by counting the seeds from 10 randomly selected pods within a plot; first pod height (FPH): determined by averaging the heights (in centimeters) of five plants at maturity, measured from the cotyledonary scar to the base of the first pod; SW: the weight of a sample containing 100 seeds expressed in grams; GYP: calculated by dividing the total mass of plant seeds by the number of plants within the effective plot area, considering a moisture content of 13%.

The phenotypic data from each trial underwent analysis using SELEGEN software (Resende,2016) and the R software (R Core Team,2013), utilizing the ggplot2 package (Wickham,2016). Within the R environment, we generated frequency density curves to illustrate the quantitative characteristics of the evaluated traits. Additionally, genetic and phenotypic correlation analyses were conducted, and scatter plots. These visualizations aimed to elucidate the potential influence of co‐localized QTLs across different traits (FigureS1).

The uppercase letters represent the incidence matrices for the aforementioned effects.

Genomic DNA extraction was performed on the 208 RILs (F2:8generation) and their parental lines (Awauna UEM and IPR88 Uirapuru) using the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. The extracted DNA was then quantified using a 1.5% agarose gel (Agarose SFR, Amresco) in TBE buffer (tris‐borate‐ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) and visualized by staining with 1 g mL−1Sybr Green (Sigma‐Aldrich).

The DNA samples were screened with 5398 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) DNA markers using the BARCBean6K_3 Illumina BeadChip, employing the Infinium HD assay ultra‐protocol (Illumina, Inc.). Fluorescence intensity measurements were obtained by imaging the BeadChip with the Illumina beadarray reader. Automatic allele calling for each locus was carried out using the GenomeStudio Genotyping Module v1.8.4 software (Illumina), followed by visual inspection. Errors in allele calling due to improper cluster identification were corrected, resulting in a final set of 800 SNPs.

Following quality assessment of SNPs using the GenomeStudio software, we employed a Microsoft Excel electronic spreadsheet to execute the filtering process. This involved excluding monomorphic SNPs present in both parental lines, Awauna UEM and IPR88 Uirapuru, as well as those with missing data exceeding 5% and a minimum allele frequency below 30%. Furthermore, SNP markers were mapped to their respective chromosomes and assigned nomenclature deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.

The QTL analysis, conducted on the new adjusted genotypic means of the phenotypic traits evaluated across the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, as well as the combination of agricultural years, was carried out using the QTL software IciMapping Version 4.2 (Meng et al.,2015). This software employs the inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method, integrating both the BIP and MET analysis modules in the appropriate sequence. These modules enable the mapping of QTL with additive effects in individual environments and QTL with environmental interactions across multiple environments (Li et al.,2015).

Significance of QTLs was determined using the 1000‐permutation test for each trait in QTL IciMapping, establishing the LOD threshold atp= 0.05. The peak LOD score was considered as the location of the QTL. For QTLs with additive effect genes, a 1 cM scan step was utilized, with a probability of 0.001 for inserting variables in stepwise regression. Detection and declaration of putative QTLs relied on a minimum LOD score of three in individual settings and a minimum LOD score of 4.5 in multi‐environmental analyses (α: 0.05; Li et al.,2015).

In QTL classification, the following criteria were applied: a main QTL is defined by a minimum LOD score of five and a proportion of the total explained phenotypic variation (total PVE) exceeding 10%; a stable QTL exhibits a LOD score greater than three in at least two environments; and a specific QTL is characterized by a minimum LOD score of five and significant QTL × E interaction. QTLs were named according to the guidelines proposed by Miklas and Porch (2010) for QTL naming in common bean. Finally, using MapChart 2.3 (Voorrips,2002), the QTLs were visually depicted on genetic linkage maps forP. vulgarisdeveloped using the RIL population Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru.

Evaluation of the RIL population at the field conditions for three crop years provided an opportunity to account for their phenotypic performance under a variety of environmental conditions (Table1and TableS1). Despite the phenotypic similarity in terms of averages between parents and RILs, these showed a wide range of extreme values (max and min), denoting a substantial transgressive segregation and indicating that both parents carry genes that contribute to the variation of traits.

Abbreviations: CV%, coefficient of variation of the phenotypic data; Inf.K, inference about the kurtosis; Inf.S, inference about the skewness; Kurt, kurtosis of the phenotypic data; Lepto, leptokurtic; Max, maximum of the phenotypic data from the RILs; Meso, mesokurtic; Min, minimum of the phenotypic data from the RILs; Skew, skewness of the phenotypic data. (+), (−), and Sym means positive asymmetric, negative asymmetric, and symmetric, respectively.

Observing the pattern of data distribution (FigureS1), the inference about the asymmetry reveals that there is a certain disturbance in the data distribution due to the complementary gene interaction in the traits PH, NPP, FPH, and GYP, as well as duplicated gene interaction in the traits NSP and SW (Table1). Obviously, such interactions are not mutually exclusive events, as they are polygenic traits.

Another important information provided by the frequency distribution in phenotypic classes concerns kurtosis. All evaluated traits reveal some form of gene interaction, especially the NPP, NSP, SW, and GYP for both showing, at some point, leptokurtic behavior of the data distribution (Table1).

The selective accuracy values obtained with the experimental data (TableS2) were, on average, >70%, being considered, therefore, high and consistent with the need for data required for the purpose of QTL mapping.

In the partition of the effects involved in the differential expression of the correlated traits, it was observed that, under the experimental conditions, the genetic effects played a major role in the correlations, since most of the traits, at some point, were genetically associated with each other in greater or lesser degree (Table2).

Genetic correlation coefficient of the traits plant height (PH), number of pods per plant (NPP), number of seeds per pod (NSP), first pod height (FPH), 100‐seed weight (SW), and grain yield per plant (GYP) of the 208 common bean recombinant inbred lines (RILs) to the agricultural years 2017, 2018, and 2019.

** and * effects at 1% and 5% probability byttest, respectively.

The genotypic correlation coefficients of PH were significant and positive with all traits, except for the NSP, which was not significant. The NPP showed a significant and positive correlation with all traits; however, its correlation with the NSP was negative. The SW had a significant and negative correlation with the NSP, but it was positively correlated with the height of the first pod and GYP. (Table2).

Although the high estimates of genetic correlation observed indicate the presence of pleiotropy, the contrast is not true, as different pleiotropic loci can result in positive or negative covariances between traits, which can cancel each other out. In other words, pleiotropic effects of different genes that affect pairs of traits may not lie in a single direction for each trait and, therefore, will not result in significant genetic correlations between them (Mackay et al.,2009).

The phenotypic correlation and its respective graphical representation, the scatter plot (FigureS1), evidenced the important role of the G × E interaction in the associated pairs, since the genotypic correlation only partially reflected the phenotypic correlation. Of the 11 pairs of significant genotypic correlations (Table2), only six remained at a phenotypic level, either the pairs: FPH and NPP; MS and NPP; GYP and NPP; NSP and MS; FPH and MS; and GYP and MS (FigureS1). In part, the explanation of the observed is supported by the premise that the interaction between pleiotropic loci and environments can alter the genetic effects of traits according to the environment, leading to differences in covariances between traits and consequent changes in correlations due to imposed environmental differences (Pavličev & Cheverud,2015).

Deviation analysis showed a significant difference between the RILs and a significant G × E interaction (α: 1% and 5%) for all evaluated traits, years, and combination of years (TableS3). Therefore, it was necessary to adjust the phenotypic means using BLUPs, mitigating environmental effects that reduce the range of population variation that would restrict QTL detection. Furthermore, the new averages avoid confusion between environmental effects and QTL, resulting in consistent values of PVE.

This study involved genotyping 208 RILs derived from the Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru cross using 5398 SNPs (TableS4). Following the filtering process, a total of 288 SNP markers were selected for mapping procedures (Table3). The mapping of the Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru population spanned 590.3 cM, with an average marker distance of 2.05 cM. The number of markers ranged from 12 to 39 per chromosome.

Our study revealed the ss715646884 marker, situated at 46,961,454 bp on chromosome Pv01 associated with PH, NPP, and GYP. Similarly, marker ss715649973 (at 1,575,721 bp) on chromosome Pv04 was found in close proximity to the peak of the QTL for both PH and FPH. Noteworthy findings emerged on Pv08, where markers ss715646109 (at 58,231,277 bp) and ss715646101 (at 58,006,525 bp) were linked to the QTLs for NPP and SW. Moreover, Pv10 unveiled two distinct QTLs for SW, associated with markers ss715650584 (at 40,255,828 bp) and ss715641827 (at 16,330,477 bp). The co‐occurrence of QTLs for different traits suggests potential pleiotropy or closely linked genes (Haggard et al.,2015). Furthermore, QTL mapping for PH, FPH, NPP, and SW revealed consistent performance across the experimental years, underscoring stability in trait expression.

QTLs associated with PH were detected on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv04. The peak of the QTL PH1AUon Pv01 was located at 4.91 cM from the marker ss715646884 (46,961,454 bp), based on data from the 2019 assay, explaining 8.9% of the phenotypic variation. QTL mapping on Pv04 (PH4AU) revealed consistent identification across both the 2017 and 2018 datasets, positioned at 2.65 cM from marker ss715649973 (1,575,721 bp). This QTL accounted for over 2.0% of the phenotypic variation in each year.

QTLs associated with NPP were identified on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv08. The QTL on Pv01 (NPP1AU) was detected in 2019 and across the combination of agricultural years, within the interval delimited by markers ss715646884 (46,961,454 bp) and ss715645259 (50,130,201 bp). This QTL explained 9.6% and 10.1% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, in each year. Intriguingly, this QTL overlaps with the region where QTLs for PH and GYP were also found. On Pv08, the NPP8AUQTL was identified in 2018, spanning the region between markers ss715647389 (59,483,302 bp) and ss715646109 (at 58,231,277 bp). This QTL explained 11.2% and 11.3% of the phenotypic variation in each respective year.

On chromosome Pv04, the QTL FPH4AUwas consistently identified across all years (2017, 2018, and 2019), positioned at 2.65 cM from marker ss715649973 (1,575,721 bp). This QTL explained >2.0% of the phenotypic variation in each year. Intriguingly, this QTL coincides with the QTL identified for PH.

QTLs associated with SW were detected on chromosomes Pv08 and Pv10. On Pv08, the QTL SW8AUwas consistently identified across all years (2017, 2018, and 2019) and in the combination of agricultural years. It spanned the interval between markers ss715646109 (at 58,231,277 bp) and ss715646101 (at 58,006,525 bp), explaining 14.2%, 12.7%, 13.9%, and 8.3% of the phenotypic variation in each respective analysis. Notably, this QTL coincides with the QTL found for NPP. On Pv10, two distinct QTLs were identified. The QTL SW10AUwas detected in 2018, and across the combination of agricultural years, it was positioned at 1.87 cM from marker ss715650584 (at 40,255,828 bp), explaining 2.7% and 2.9% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Additionally, the QTL SW10.2AUwas identified in the combination of agricultural years, spanning the interval between markers ss715641827 (at 16,330,477 bp) and ss715649351 (at 61,114,365 bp), explaining 7.6% of the phenotypic variation.

The QTL GY1AU, located on chromosome Pv01 between the markers ss715646884 and ss715645259 at positions 46,961,454 bp and 50,130,201 bp, was identified both in 2019 and across the combination of agricultural years. It explains from 6.8% to 7.9% of the phenotypic variation and coincides with the region where QTLs for PH and NPP were also found.

The observed genetic correlations between NPP and GYP across all years, as well as between PH and NPP, and PH and GYP in 2018 and 2019 (Table2), suggest the presence of pleiotropic loci or loci located in tightly linked regions of the genome, as noted by Haggard et al. (2015). This implies that a greater number of shared QTL could lead to larger values of genetic correlation (Gardner & Latta,2007). Indeed, QTL co‐localization for correlated variables has been documented in various studies (Briñez et al.,2017; García‐Fernández et al.,2021; Mukeshimana et al.,2014; Nabateregga et al.,2019; Sedlar et al.,2020; Trapp et al.,2015).

In the study, putative QTLs were identified for the PH trait on both chromosome Pv01 (PH1AU) and chromosome Pv04 (PH1AU). Notably, on chromosome Pv01, a co‐localized QTL was discovered for PH, NPP, and GYP in close proximity to the marker ss715646884 (46,961,454 bp). This finding was supported by a significant and positive genetic correlation coefficient among these traits. Interestingly, González et al. (2016) also reported similar co‐localization for these three traits.

Stable QTLs for both PH and FPH were consistently mapped together at the beginning of chromosome Pv04, near the marker ss715649973 (1,575,721 bp). Notably, this QTL stands out for its stability across multiple years, exhibiting non‐significant QTL × E interaction (TableS5). Furthermore, these traits demonstrated a consistent genetic correlation across all assays. It is worth mentioning that the primary genetic influence driving the increase in PH originates from the parental line Awauna UEM.

PH plays a crucial role in the common bean crop, influencing the formation of yield components (Fang et al.,2020). An upright growth habit and lower susceptibility to lodging are vital factors for facilitating both manual and mechanized harvesting processes. Moreover, optimal PH facilitates cultivation practices, minimizing harvest losses and the incidence of diseases. This, in turn, allows for increased harvest frequency per year by reducing the crop cycle (Mendes et al.,2009).

Several studies have consistently mapped QTLs for the PH trait on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv04 (Delfini et al.,2021; J. C. F. Elias et al.,2021; González et al.,2016; Silva et al.,2018). Additionally, Tar'an et al. (2002), Blair et al. (2006), Checa and Blair (2008), and Chavarro and Blair (2010) have reported QTLs for the PH trait on both Pv01 and Pv04 in their respective studies.

Indeed, comparing results across different studies can be challenging due to variations in populations and marker technologies utilized. Despite methodological differences, the consistent identification of QTLs on Pv01 across multiple studies underscores the robustness of this genetic region's association with the PH trait in common bean crops.

In the NPP trait, putative QTLs were identified on both chromosome Pv01 (NPP1AU) and Pv08 (NPP8AU). Once more, our study revealed a QTL on Pv01, which was co‐localized with QTLs for PH, NPP, and GYP in close proximity to the marker ss715646884 (46,961,454 bp).

This stable QTL, NPP1AU, exceeds the contribution to the increase in NPP derived from the parental line IPR88 Uirapuru, as indicated by the additivity values. Despite exhibiting QTL × environment interaction (TableS5), the predominant portion of the phenotypic variation is attributed to additive effects (A), with minimal environmental influence. This observation confirms the authenticity of the QTL, suggesting its reliability in genetic prediction across diverse environments. Consequently, markers such as ss715646884 emerge as compelling candidates for multi‐trait marker‐assisted selection strategies.

On chromosome Pv08, we detected a QTL co‐localized for both the NPP and SW in close proximity to marker ss715646109 (58,231,277 bp). Notably, NPP and SW exhibited a consistent genetic correlation across all assays. Additive effects predominantly influenced both traits, with the increase in NPP attributed to the parental line IPR88 Uirapuru and the increase in SW attributed to Awauna UEM. This QTL demonstrated no significant QTL × environment interaction, underscoring its importance for marker‐assisted selection strategies (TableS5).

Several studies have consistently mapped QTLs for NPP trait on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv08. Mukeshimana et al. (2014) and Langat et al. (2019) mapped QTLs associated with drought tolerance in common bean and identified QTLs for NPP on Pv01. Similarly, González et al. (2016) and Delfini et al. (2021) also identified significant QTLs for NPP on Pv01. Additionally, Vargas et al. (2021) and Mir et al. (2021) also mapped QTLs for NPP on chromosomes Pv01 and Pv08. Cordoba‐Novoa et al. (2022) conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genetic variability and underlying architecture of traits pertinent to transpiration, stomatal regulation, and the overall water utilization of the whole plant within Mesoamerican common bean germplasm. They successfully identified specific genomic regions located on Pv01 and Pv07 that are significantly associated with critical traits, such as the mean normalized transpiration rate and the essential fraction of transpirable soil water.

In the FPH trait, a putative stable QTL, FPH4AU, was uniquely mapped to chromosome Pv04. The primary genetic contribution to the increase in FPH was attributed to the parental line Awauna UEM. This trait demonstrated genetic correlation with other evaluated traits, across all assays, except with the NSP and GYP. Moreover, besides being stable over the years, the QTL FPH4AUidentified on this chromosome for FPH, co‐localized with PH, showed no significant QTL × environment interaction. Therefore, these QTLs are highly desirable in breeding programs as they offer greater reliability for marker‐assisted selection (Table1and TableS5).

The FPH trait has received considerable attention in common bean breeding programs, particularly with the modernization of crop management and the increase in large‐scale production. There is a growing need for plants with higher and more uniform pod insertion to facilitate mechanized harvesting. Despite this, relatively few studies have mapped QTLs for FPH on chromosome Pv04. Beattie et al. (2003), in their investigations into mapping QTLs for a common bean ideotype, identified QTLs for FPH on Pv04. Similarly, more recently, Delfini et al. (2021) also reported mapping QTLs for FPH on this chromosome. These findings underscore the importance of further research in this area to facilitate the development of common bean varieties with improved FPH characteristics.

In SW trait, putative QTLs were identified on chromosomes Pv08 and Pv10. Specifically, on Pv08, we consistently identified a QTL for SW across all evaluated crop years, as well as in the combined analysis, co‐localized with NPP near the marker ss715646109 (58,231,277 bp). It is noteworthy that SW and NPP exhibited a genetic correlation in all assays. Both traits were primarily influenced by additive effects, with the increase in SW attributed to Awauna UEM and the increase in NPP attributed to IPR88 Uirapuru. While this QTL did show significant QTL × environment interaction, the partition of total (PVE; 12.10) indicated that additive effects (11.49) outweighed the effects of the genotype‐by‐environment interaction (0.61), confirming its importance for assisted selection (TableS5).

On Pv10, we identified two QTL for SW. The SW10AU, linked to the marker ss715650584 (40,255,828 bp), exhibited QTL×E interaction (TableS5); however, the majority of the phenotypic variation is attributed to additive effects (A) with small environment influence, and therefore confirmed that it is a true QTL. In turn, the QTL SW10.2AU, linked to the marker ss715641827 (16,330,477 bp), did not show significant QTL×E interaction and therefore is desirable in breeding programs, as it is more reliable for assisted selection (Table1and TableS5). The genetic contribution to the increase in the SW derives from the parental UEM×IPR88 Uirapuru.

It is indeed quite common for various studies to map QTLs related to SW on chromosomes Pv08 and Pv10 in common bean. Silva et al. (2018), Kamfwa et al. (2018), and Nabateregga et al. (2019) also reported QTLs on Pv08 associated with this trait. Lei et al. (2020) and J. C. F. Elias et al. (2021) mapped QTLs for SW on Pv10. Similarly, Trapp et al. (2015), Sandhu et al. (2018), Langat et al. (2019), Murube et al. (2020), Valdisser et al. (2020), Vargas et al. (2021), and Mir et al. (2021) identified QTLs for SW on Pv08 and Pv10.

The stability observed in the majority of the identified QTLs across multiple years, coupled with their relatively modest phenotypic contribution, suggests the involvement of numerous loci with small effects in governing the expression of these traits. This finding aligns with the insights provided by Luo et al. (2020), indicating that the genetic architecture underlying these traits may be characterized by the cumulative impact of multiple minor effect loci.

In the GYP trait, we identified a single putative QTL situated on chromosome Pv01. Remarkably, this QTL, designated as GY1AU, was co‐localized for GYP, PH, and NPP in close proximity to the marker ss715646884 (46,961,454 bp). The genetic correlation observed among PH, NPP, and GYP (Table2) underscores the significance of uncovering co‐located QTL governing these traits. Notably, this stable QTL, GY1AU, demonstrates a greater contribution to the enhancement of GYP, surpassing the additive effects derived from the UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru parental lines, as evidenced by the additivity values (Table4). Cordoba‐Novoa and Hoyos‐Villegas (2024) discerned loci correlated with agronomic characteristics such as flowering time, maturation rate, and yield in Middle American common beans, with loci located on Pv02 and Pv04 demonstrating interaction effects on both flowering time and yield. Furthermore, they underlined the significance of epistatic interactions among genomic regions to facilitate the optimal stacking of advantageous alleles aimed at enhancing yield outcomes. Importantly, the utilization of Pv03 and Pv08 as reference loci could lead to yield enhancement, while the allocation of markers on Pv01 and Pv04 as reference and alternative loci, respectively, would further augment yield efficiency.

Several studies have mapped QTL for grain yield on chromosome Pv01, underscoring the significance of our findings (Briñez et al.,2017; L. M. Diaz et al.,2018; Langat et al.,2019; S. Diaz et al.,2020). Additionally, research by Sedlar et al. (2020), Valdisser et al. (2020), Delfini et al. (2021), and Mir et al. (2021) has consistently mapped QTL related to grain yield on chromosome Pv01. Arriagada et al. (2023) executed a meta‐QTL (MQTL) analysis aimed at discerning robust genomic regions correlated with yield‐related characteristics in common bean. They elucidated that 28 MQTL were linked to both yield and phenological characteristics, underscoring their applicability for breeding programs.

The clustering of QTL for GYP, PH, and NPP in close proximity on Pv01 highlights the potential significance of this chromosomal region for commercial bean breeders (Geravandi et al.,2020). Such co‐localized QTL clusters offer promising targets for marker‐assisted selection, enabling the simultaneous improvement of multiple agronomic traits and thereby enhancing overall crop productivity and performance.

In conclusion, this study marks a substantial progression in the genetic characterization of the RIL population derived from the Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru cross. Utilizing 288 polymorphic SNP markers and comprehensive phenotypic data, we identified consistent QTL associated with key agronomic traits. A total of five QTL linked to PH, NPP, FPH, SW, and GYP were detected across chromosomes Pv01, Pv04, Pv08, and Pv10. Notably, three QTL exhibited co‐localization for multiple traits, indicating potential pleiotropic effects or close genetic linkage. On chromosome Pv01, a QTL was identified that simultaneously influenced PH, NPP, and GYP. Similarly, chromosome Pv04 harbored QTL affecting both PH and FPH, while Pv08 contained QTL linked to NPP and SW. Finally, two distinct QTLs associated with SW were identified on Pv10. QTL mapping in individual environments successfully identified co‐located, main, and relatively stable QTL, while multi‐environment QTL mapping confirmed their relative importance. This comprehensive mapping QTL in the Awauna UEM × IPR88 Uirapuru population holds significant implications for common bean breeding programs, particularly for the Black commercial group in Brazil, which has historically received limited research attention despite its economic importance.
