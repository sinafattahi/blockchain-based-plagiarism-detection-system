The anti‐inflammatory cytokine interleukin‐4 (IL4) has been recognised as a protective factor in various cardiovascular events, yet its prognostic value in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) remains unclear. The study aimed to measure the levels of plasma IL4 in patients with PH and to explore their potential association with disease risk and outcomes.

In this observational study, we analysed the levels of plasma IL4 in 766 PH patients and 191 healthy controls in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital from October 2009 to January 2024. To establish the correlations between plasma IL4 levels and the risk and outcomes of PH, all patients were followed up from June 2013 to June 2024. The Spearman correlation test was employed to evaluate the relationships between IL4 and right heart catheterisation parameters among patients with PH. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IL4 for PH. The Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to assess the prognostic value of IL4 levels. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict PH incidence. A nomogram was constructed to predict mortality, and its clinical utility was validated using decision curve analysis (DCA).

Plasma IL4 levels were significantly decreased in patients with PH compared with controls (p< 0.001), as well as in different PH groups (p< 0.05 for all). The logistic regression analyses indicated that the lower IL4 levels were associated with the high risk of PH (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.716–0.872;p< 0.001). IL4 levels correlated inversely with NT‐proBNP (r= −0.10,p< 0.05) and mPAP (r= −0.01,p< 0.05), and positively with CI (r= 0.12,p< 0.05) and PaSaO2 (r= 0.11,p< 0.05), indicating an association with disease severity. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that patients with IL4 ≥ 2.8774 pg/mL had a 3‐year cumulative survival rate of 91.28%, compared with 82.83% for those with IL4 < 2.8774 pg/mL (log–rankp= 0.007). Cox regression confirmed IL4 as an independent predictor of survival (HR = 0.810, 95% CI: 0.660–0.993;p= 0.043). A diagnostic model combining IL4, 6MWD and NT‐proBNP demonstrated good prognostic value (AUC = 0.692,p< 0.0001).

Plasma IL4 levels were significantly decreased in patients with PH, exhibiting a negative correlation with disease severity; furthermore, lower IL4 levels may serve as a prognostic indicator of poor outcomes in patients with PH.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a syndrome characterised by restricted flow through the pulmonary arterial circulation, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and, ultimately, right heart failure [1]. Clinically, PH is categorised into five groups: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, Group 1 PH), PH associated with left‐sided heart disease (Group 2 PH), PH associated with lung diseases or hypoxia (Group 3 PH), PH associated with chronic pulmonary arterial obstruction (Group 4 PH), or PH with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms [2]. PAH can be further subclassified into idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), connective tissue disease (CTD) and congenital heart disease (CHD), due to the presence of cardiac and pulmonary causes of PAH. The prevalence of PAH ranges from 15 to 52 cases per million, with an incidence rate of 2.4 to 7.6 per million, and it predominantly affects females [3]. With the clinical application of targeted therapeutic drugs, the annual survival rate of patients with IPAH in China has increased from 68.0% to 92.1%, but the long‐term survival rate is still low [4,5]. Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of PH and identifying novel therapeutic targets is of paramount clinical importance. Moreover, effective prognostic prediction plays a crucial role in guiding clinical decision‐making and optimising treatment strategies.

The typical pathological characteristics of PH include excessive proliferation of distal pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, abnormal pulmonary vascular muscle normalisation and infiltration of inflammatory cells around the diseased vessel [2,6]. Inflammation is a critical pathogenic mechanism across various etiologies of PH [7,8,9]. Previous studies [10,11] have shown that the Th2 cell‐related immunoinflammatory response can regulate the pulmonary vascular remodelling process in PH. Interleukin‐4 (IL4), a Th2 cytokine with anti‐inflammatory properties, has been shown to protect against pulmonary inflammation [12]. Patients with IPAH showed elevated Th2 lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes, IL‐6 and TNF‐alpha, whereas Th1/Th17 lymphocytes and IL4 were reduced. Patients with IPAH have a reduced ability to produce IL4, compared with healthy individuals [13]. Additionally, a suppression of anti‐inflammatory cytokines, including IL4, has been observed in PH animal models [14]. However, there are few studies on the correlation between IL4 and other types of PH, especially in large cohorts. With the increasing importance of inflammation in the prognostic evaluation of patients with PH, exploring inflammatory biomarkers is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Here, we measured the levels of plasma IL4 in patients with PH and assessed their association with the risk and outcomes of PH.

This observational study included a total of 766 patients diagnosed with PH and 191 age‐ and gender‐matched control subjects, conducted from October 2009 to January 2024. All patients underwent right heart catheterisation (RHC) for confirmation of their diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for PH were mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg, PVR > 2 wood units, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mmHg. Patients without plasma who did not meet the criteria for PH diagnosis or who had incomplete information were excluded with no selection bias. Subjects without PH, chronic lung disease and neurological disorders were included in the control group, as well as 10 patients (1.3%) lost to follow‐up were censored as alive on the last day of contact. All patients in this study provided informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (number: K23‐206).

Hemodynamic and clinical data at the time of diagnosis were collected for the analysis of PH during inpatient cardiopulmonary screening. Patients were treated according to the ERS/ESC guidelines and prospectively followed up with half‐yearly scheduled visits to the outpatient clinic [15]. The median follow‐up duration was 47.4 (27.4, 76.8) months, focusing on all‐cause mortality at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital.

All participants underwent 6‐min walk tests. Peripheral blood was collected from both patients with PH and the control group for the study. The samples of 10‐mL venous blood were extracted from the femoral vein and stored in anticoagulant and procoagulant tubes respectively. The concentration of plasma IL4 was detected by flow cytometry.

Normally distributed continuous variables are described as either mean ± SD or the median [25th–75th percentile]. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies (percentages). Data were tested for adherence to a normal distribution with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method. The Mann–Whitney test was utilised to compare nonparametric data, and the unpairedt‐test (with Welch correction) was used for parametric data. The Spearman correlation coefficients were utilised to investigate the associations between IL4 and various other variables. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between IL4 levels and the risk of PH. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between IL4 and clinical worsening events in patients with PH, followed by the construction of a nomogram for the prognostic model. ROC curve was used to select the cut‐off values of the parameters. According to the cut‐off of ROC analysis, the continuous variables of plasma IL4 levels are transformed into categorical variables. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were calculated to assess the diagnostic performance of IL4 levels in distinguishing patients with PH from healthy controls. The Kaplan–Meier method was utilised to derive survival curves, which were then compared using the log–rank test. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical utility of the prognostic model incorporating IL4 levels, 6MWD and NT‐proBNP. Values ofp< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 and R studio.

Table1presents the baseline characteristics of patients with PH, including 766 patients with PH (mean age: 53.2 ± 17.2 years, male sex: 37.2%) and 191 healthy controls matched to the inclusion criteria (mean age: 51.0 ± 14.5 years, male sex 44.5%). There are 392, 107, 205 and 62 patients in Group 1, Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 PH cohorts, respectively. There were 145 IPAH, 78 CHD and 169 patients with CTD in the PAH cohort, respectively. The distribution of the World Health Organization Functional Class (WHO FC) among patients with PH was as follows: 19 in Class I, 256 in Class II, 440 in Class III and 51 in Class IV. Baseline plasma levels of IL4 were 2.0 pg/mL (Q1‐Q3: 1.1–2.9 pg/mL) in PH and 2.8 pg/mL (Q1‐Q3: 1.7–3.8 pg/mL) in controls.

We observed a significant reduction in the levels of plasma IL4 in patients with PH compared with controls (Figure1A). Subsequent subtype analysis revealed that the levels of IL4 were also significantly lower in patients with G1, G2 and G4 PH subtypes compared with healthy controls (Figure1B). A significant decrease in the level of IL4 was observed in patients with IPAH and CHD (Figure1C). Additionally, we discovered that the levels of IL4 were also significantly decreased in both female and male patients with PH compared with healthy controls (Figure1D).

The levels of IL4 were found to be associated with the disease risk of PH. Among the patients with PH, the area under the ROC of IL4 was 0.63 (sensitivity 75%, specificity 48%,p< 0.0001, Figure2A,C) as compared with healthy controls. Similarly, among the patients with four PH groups, the AUC of IL4 was 0.64 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 48%,p< 0.0001), 0.59 (sensitivity 68%, specificity 54%,p= 0.0077), 0.58 (sensitivity 39%, specificity 81%,p= 0.0004) and 0.71 (sensitivity 69%, specificity 69%,p< 0.0001) as compared with healthy controls (Figure2B,C).

Table2presents the results of the Logistic regression analysis. Decreased levels of IL4 were predictive of a higher overall incidence rate of PH in the univariate model (OR = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.716–0.872];p< 0.001). The levels of IL4 remained a significant predictor for disease after adjustments for age and gender (OR = 0.772 [95% CI: 0.698–0.854];p< 0.001). Both male and female patients were predicted by lower IL4 levels in univariate or adjusted models.

Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to explore the association between IL4 and clinical worsening events in patients with PH. There were significant negative correlations between IL4 and biomarkers of heart failure, including NT‐proBNP, mPAP, CI and PaSaO2 in the PH cohort (allp< 0.05, Figure3).

As revealed by the univariate Cox regression analysis, the plasma IL4 levels were associated with the survival of patients with PH (HR [95% CI], 0.769 [0.652–0.908],p= 0.002, Table3). Moreover, the multivariate Cox regression analysis also confirmed that plasma IL4 levels were independently associated with the survival of patients with PH (HR [95% CI], 0.810 [0.660–0.993],p= 0.043), as well as gender, 6MWD and NT‐proBNP (allp< 0.05, Table3).

Moreover, we generated a nomogram using the Cox regression algorithm to predict the death odds of patients with PH (Figure4). The predictors included gender, IL4, 6MWD and NT‐proBNP. The contribution of IL4 to predict patient survival rates after 1, 3 and 5 years was comparable to 6MWD. To better match the needs of clinical practice, DCA was used to validate the predictive effectiveness of the nomogram (Figure5). The results showed that both models yielded positive clinical net benefits for interventions within the range of 20%–50%, suggesting that the superior clinical utility of the nomogram in the present study was generalisable.

Among the nonsurvivors with PH, the AUC of IL4 was 0.59 as compared with survivors (p= 0.0051, Figure6A). The cut‐off value was 2.8774 pg/mL. It was possible to stratify patients with PH into groups with significantly better and worse cumulative survival on the levels of IL4. Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that patients with IL4 < 2.8774 had a lower probability of survival (log–rankp= 0.007, Figure6B). For example, at 3 years, the cumulative survival for patients with IL4 < 2.8774 was 82.83%, whereas the cumulative survival for patients with IL4 ≥ 2.8774 was 91.28%. In addition, the ROC curve formed by the indices of IL4, 6MWD and NT‐proBNP could be used for PH diagnosis, with the area under the ROC curve being 0.692 (p< 0.0001, Figure6C). The patients were divided by the cut‐off value (0.13389) into low‐ and high‐risk groups, which had good diagnostic value (log–rankp< 0.0001, Figure6D).

The present study comprehensively evaluated the role of IL4 in PH by examining its levels in patients with PH and healthy controls. Our findings revealed that IL4 levels were significantly reduced in patients with PH compared with controls, suggesting a potential association with disease pathogenesis. Logistic regression analysis further indicated that lower IL4 levels were predictive of a higher risk of PH. Additionally, IL4 levels correlated with markers of disease severity and were independently associated with survival outcomes in patients with PH. These results highlight the potential of IL4 as a biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis in PH. This research marks the first instance of profiling the relationship between IL4 and PH in a large cohort, supporting the hypothesis that systemic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the progression of PH and may serve as valuable prognostic indicators.

The significant reduction in plasma IL4 levels in patients with PH compared with controls suggests that IL4 may serve as a potential biomarker for the disease. This is further supported by the subtype analysis, which shows lower IL4 levels across different PH subtypes and gender, indicating a consistent pattern regardless of the underlying cause of PH. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that lower IL4 levels were associated with a higher incidence of PH, even after adjusting for age and gender. This suggests that IL4 may have a protective role in the development of PH. The observed association could be attributed to IL4's anti‐inflammatory properties, which might counteract the pro‐inflammatory processes driving PH progression. Future studies should explore the mechanistic pathways through which IL4 influences PH development.

Moreover, our study revealed significant correlations between IL4 levels and markers of disease severity, which suggested that IL4 levels may reflect the overall burden of disease in patients with PH. The inverse correlation with NT‐proBNP and mPAP indicates that lower IL4 levels are associated with more severe haemodynamic compromise, whereas the positive correlation with CI and PaSaO2 suggests that higher IL4 levels are linked to better cardiac function and oxygenation. These results highlight the potential of IL4 as a biomarker for monitoring disease severity in clinical practice. The nomogram, which includes IL4, gender, 6MWD and NT‐proBNP, offers a refined tool for prognosis prediction. The comparable contribution of IL4 to 6MWD in predicting survival rates underscores the importance of IL4 in assessing the prognosis of patients with PH. The Cox regression analysis further illustrates the impact of IL4 levels on survival, with patients having IL4 levels below the cut‐off value having a significantly lower probability of survival. This finding could be used to stratify patients into risk groups, potentially guiding treatment decisions and follow‐up strategies.

Inflammation and inflammatory cytokines may be an important part of the initial response to injury contributing to the process of vascular remodelling in PH. Studies have established the role of inflammation in PH pathogenesis and progression [16,17,18]. Plasma levels of cytokines, including IL2, IL6, IL8 and IL10, were significantly higher in patients with PH compared with controls [19,20,21]. IL4 is a cytokine involved in the development of PH, but the correlation between IL4 and PH remains controversial. IL4 has been shown to have a dual role in PH. On one hand, it can promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and vascular remodelling, contributing to disease progression. On the other hand, in certain contexts, it may also have protective effects by promoting the generation of anti‐inflammatory M2 macrophages [22,23,24,25]. The reduction of IL4 may lead to an imbalance in the inflammatory milieu, favouring the predominance of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α, IL‐6 and IL‐1β. This imbalance can promote endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, all of which contribute to vascular remodelling. The specific mechanisms through which IL4 deficiency affects vascular remodelling in PH warrant further investigation. However, there was no relationship between cytokine levels and haemodynamic parameters in patients with PH [26]. This divergence may stem from the use of different parameters to assess the increased risk of death. Moreover, a study showed increased IL4 in male patients with PH, with no significant change in females [27], indicating the gender difference of cytokine in patients with PH.

Our findings have important clinical implications for the management of patients with PH. By identifying IL4 as a predictor of clinical deterioration in patients with PH, our study provides clinicians with an additional tool for risk stratification and prognosis. Blood biomarkers offer hope for future diagnostic methods. The study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the study was conducted in a single centre, which can introduce selection bias. Larger, multicentre studies would be needed to confirm these results and to ensure that they can be applied to diverse patient populations. Second, although IL4 shows a significant reduction in patients with PH, the AUC (0.63) indicates moderate sensitivity and specificity. This suggests that IL4 alone may not be a strong diagnostic biomarker. Combining IL4 with other biomarkers could improve diagnostic accuracy. Thirdly, the Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis provide prognostic information, but they rely on the accuracy of the data collected, including the timing of events and censoring. Any errors in data collection could affect the survival estimates. Finally, our study does not directly address the mechanism and pathological role of IL4 in PH, but we are the first to systematically assess the comprehensive evaluation of IL4 in predicting clinical worsening in patients with PH. Our findings suggest that lower levels of IL4 are significantly associated with increased risk, clinical worsening of PH, which extends the findings of research on systemic inflammation in PH.

Through comprehensive analysis of IL4 expression in patients with PH plasma and its correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes, we demonstrated significantly reduced plasma IL4 levels in patients with PH compared with healthy controls. Our findings reveal a significant association between IL4 levels and both disease risk and survival outcomes in PH, suggesting that IL4 may represent a promising prognostic biomarker for PH.
