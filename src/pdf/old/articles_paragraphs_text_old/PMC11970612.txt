Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs) are associated with several antiretrovirals. Doravirine (DOR), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for HIV-1 treatment, does not interact significantly with known neurotransmitter receptors in vitro. First-line therapy with DOR-based regimens resulted in significantly fewer NPAEs than efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) and similar rates to those of ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) with 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) through week 96 of the phase 3 DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD studies, respectively.

In the DRIVE-AHEAD (NCT02403674) and DRIVE-FORWARD studies (NCT02275780), treatment-naive adults randomly received DOR/lamivudine/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF and DOR + 2 NRTIs or DRV/r + 2 NRTIs, respectively, for a 96-week double-blind phase; afterward, participants could continue or switch to a DOR-based regimen for a 96-week open-label extension.

Overall, 269 and 233 participants in the DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD studies, respectively, switched to a DOR-based regimen. At week 96, 26 and 15 participants randomized to EFV/FTC/TDF and DRV/r + 2 NRTIs, respectively, had ongoing NPAEs, resolving by week 192 in 73% (19/26) and 40% (6/15) of participants switching to a DOR-based regimen. New-onset NPAEs were reported by 9% (25/269) and 8% (18/233) of participants; by week 192, new-onset NPAEs were resolved and/or resolving in 60% (15/25) and 61% (11/18) of participants.

In both trial extensions, NPAEs persisted in 3%–4% of participants 96 weeks after switching to a DOR-based regimen, possibly representing the background rate for these events. This suggests that DOR-based therapy may be a good option for adults with baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms or those experiencing NPAEs with other antiretrovirals.

For the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz (EFV), NPAEs were the most common adverse events, with more than 50.0% of participants reporting such adverse events in most clinical trials.10–12Accordingly, experiencing NPAEs has been one of the main reasons for discontinuation of EFV.13The most frequently reported NPAEs with EFV are abnormal dreams, sleep disturbances, insomnia, dizziness, anxiety, and depression.10–13Preclinical studies suggest that EFV-induced neurotoxicity may be mediated through interactions with receptors (eg, serotonin 5-HT) and transporters (eg, serotonin, dopamine) known to be targets for drugs of abuse.5,14,15Together, these data highlight the need for alternative treatment options for those experiencing NPAEs with current first-line antiretroviral regimens.

In this study, we report on NPAEs in participants who switched to a DOR-based regimen in the open-label, 96-week extensions of the DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD trials, focusing on resolution of NPAEs that had been ongoing from the double-blind phases, and onset and resolution of new NPAEs after switching to a DOR-based regimen in the extension phases.

The DRIVE-AHEAD (MK-1439A-021,NCT02403674) and DRIVE-FORWARD (MK-1439-018,NCT02275780) trials were randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trials in adults with previously untreated HIV-1.19,20,22–24Participants were randomized to a DOR-based regimen (DOR/3TC/TDF or DOR + 2 NRTIs) or a comparator regimen (EFV/FTC/TDF or DRV/r + 2 NRTIs, FTC/TDF or abacavir/3TC) for 96 weeks of double-blind treatment. On completing the double-blind phase, eligible participants in the comparator groups could switch to the study-specific DOR-based regimen for an additional 96 weeks in an open-label study extension (see Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). In participants originally randomized to a comparator regimen who switched to a DOR-based regimen in the extensions, we examined the persistence of NPAEs reported during treatment with the comparator in the double-blind phase. We also examined new-onset NPAEs that occurred after participants switched to a DOR-based regimen (see Figure 2, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). All NPAEs were summarized descriptively.

Five categories of NPAEs were predefined: sleep disorders, depression and related disorders (suicide/self-injury), dizziness, altered sensorium, and psychotic disorders. These represent the most commonly reported neuropsychiatric events in the phase 2b study of DOR.18The specific terms included for each category were based on the MedDRA 23.0. All such events were pooled and evaluated as neuropsychiatric events. The same categories were used to evaluate NPAEs during the double-blind phase of the DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD trials.19,22,23Although predefined NPAE categories did not include headache, this was a commonly reported nervous system adverse event in both the DRIVE-AHEAD19,22and DRIVE-FORWARD trials,20,23and, therefore, was included in this analysis.

At the end of the double-blind phase (week 96), 73.9% (269/364) of participants randomized to EFV/FTC/TDF in the DRIVE-AHEAD trial switched to open-label DOR/3TC/TDF and 60.8% (233/383) of participants randomized to DRV/r + 2 NRTIs in the DRIVE-FORWARD trial switched to open-label DOR + 2 NRTIs. Demographics and baseline characteristics of participants who switched to the open-label DOR regimen are shown in Supplemental Digital Content (see Table 1,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). Across both trials, most participants were assigned male at birth (86.6%) and received TDF in their original regimen (93.6%). In both trials during the double-blind phase, participants who switched to a DOR-based regimen reported similar rates of NPAEs and headache (see Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419) to those reported by all participants originally randomized to the respective comparator groups (see Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419).19,20Two participants discontinued the trial extensions because of an NPAE: 1 participant in the DRIVE-AHEAD trial (who switched from EFV/FTC/TDF to DOR/3TC/TDF) because of schizophrenia and 1 participant in the DRIVE-FORWARD trial (who continued with DOR + 2 NRTIs) because of insomnia.

In the DRIVE-AHEAD trial, NPAEs were ongoing in 9.7% (26/269) of participants before switch from EFV/FTC/TDF to DOR/3TC/TDF at week 96. After the regimen switch, these NPAEs resolved or were resolving in 73.1% (19/26) of these participants and NPAEs remained ongoing in only 2.6% (7/269) of all participants at week 192. Sleep disorders and disturbances (mainly abnormal dreams and insomnia, see Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419) and dizziness were the most common NPAEs ongoing at week 96 (Fig.1A). At the end of study treatment (week 192 or time of discontinuation), most participants with ongoing sleep disorders and all participants with ongoing dizziness reported resolution of these events after switching to DOR/3TC/TDF (Table1). Headache was ongoing in 5 participants (1.9%) at week 96 and resolved in 3 (1.1%) after the switch. In the DRIVE-FORWARD trial, NPAEs were ongoing in 6.4% of participants (15/233) before switch from DRV/r- to DOR-based regimens at week 96 in the open-label extension. At the end of study treatment, these NPAEs resolved or were resolving, or remained ongoing, in 40.0% (6/15) and 60.0% (9/15) of participants, respectively. Sleep disorders and disturbances (mainly insomnia) and depression were the most common NPAEs ongoing at week 96 (Fig.1B and Table1). Sleep disorders and disturbances resolved in only 1 out of 8 participants after switching to a DOR-based regimen, whereas depression resolved in 5 out of 8 participants (Table1). Headache was ongoing in 4 participants (1.7%) at week 96 and resolved in all 4 after switching to DOR-based regimen.

Persistent NPAEs (A, B) and new-onset NPAEs (C, D) at week 192 in the DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD extension phase. A, Persistence of NPAEs at week 192 in DRIVE-AHEAD participants randomized to EFV/FTC/TDF and switched to DOR/3TC/TDF at week 96. B, Persistence of NPAEs at week 192 in DRIVE-FORWARD participants randomized to DRV/r + 2 NRTIs and switched to DOR + 2 NRTIs at week 96. C, Persistence of new-onset NPAEs at week 192 in DRIVE-AHEAD participants randomized to EFV/FTC/TDF and switched to DOR/3TC/TDF at week 96. D, Persistence of new-onset NPAEs at week 192 in DRIVE-FORWARD participants randomized to DRV/r + 2 NRTIs and switched to DOR + 2 NRTIs at week 96.

Specific terms included for each category were based on MedDRA 23.0. A participant with multiple AEs within a category is counted a single time for that category. NRTIs were TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC. The 5 categories of NPAEs were predefined. Data shown as n (%).

Headache was not included in the predefined NPAE categories and is not included in the total number of participants with persisting NPAEs.

In the DRIVE-AHEAD trial, new-onset NPAEs were reported by 9.3% (25/269) of participants after switching to DOR/3TC/TDF at week 96 (see Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). Any new-onset NPAEs had resolved or were resolving in 15 participants and remained ongoing in 10 participants (see Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419) by the end of study treatment. One account of drug-related headache was reported, which was considered mild and resolved by the end of study treatment. In the DRIVE-FORWARD trial, any new-onset NPAEs were reported by 7.7% (18/233) of participants after switching to DOR + 2 NRTIs at week 96. New-onset NPAEs had resolved or were resolving in 11 participants and remained ongoing in 7 participants by the end of study treatment (see Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). In both studies, the most common new-onset NPAEs were sleep disorders and depression (Figs.1C, D). Most new-onset dizziness, altered sensorium, and sleep disorders resolved by the end of the study, while most new-onset depression did not (see Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). New-onset headache was reported by 5.9% (16/269) and 6.0% (14/233) of participants after switching to DOR/3TC/TDF or DOR + 2 NRTIs, respectively, at week 96 (see Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419). New-onset headache remained ongoing in 1 and 2 participants, respectively, by the end of study treatment.

People living with chronic medical conditions, including HIV, are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition than those without chronic medical conditions.25Neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety, are more prevalent among persons with HIV than those without HIV.26–31Antiretrovirals should not precipitate or exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms.

In both studies, participants switching to a DOR-based regimen experienced fewer new-onset NPAEs (9.3% after switch from EFV; 7.7% after switch from DRV/r) than participants initially treated with DOR/3TC/TDF in the DRIVE-AHEAD trial (26.4%) or DOR + 2 NRTIs in the DRIVE-FORWARD trial (15.7%).19,20Most of the new-onset NPAEs had resolved by the end of the open-label study extension. The most persistent NPAE was depression, a common neuropsychiatric complication in adults with HIV owing to multiple potentially contributing mechanisms,39which remained ongoing in a total of 10 participants.

Our results are consistent with a previous report from a parallel-group, direct comparison phase 2 trial of DOR-based regimens that demonstrated significantly fewer NPAEs than EFV-based regimens.18Although in a previous phase 2 study that enrolled participants with CNS complaints while receiving EFV/FTC/TDF and randomized participants to immediate or delayed switch to DOR/3TC/TDF, improvement in NPAEs was not substantially different between the 2 groups40; selection bias may have skewed the results because only those participants who tolerated EFV well enough to consent to a potential randomization to the deferred switch arm were enrolled, whereas individuals who could not tolerate EFV had likely already discontinued this medication as part of standard clinical care and would not have been enrolled in the trial.40Furthermore, given that EFV acts as a partial serotonin 5-HT2Areceptor agonist,5,15it is reasonable to expect withdrawal-type syndromes, which may result in an increased frequency of NPAEs after discontinuation of EFV.

The current investigation is likely a more accurate reflection of the difference between EFV and DOR with regard to the incidence, persistence, and resolution of NPAEs, although the study does present limitations. These are post hoc analyses from open-label study extensions without control groups and, although these participants had reported NPAEs at rates similar to those reported by all participants randomized to the respective comparator groups (57.6% versus 58.5% in the DRIVE-AHEAD trial; 17.6% versus 18.8% in the DRIVE-FORWARD trial; see Tables 1 and 2, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419) before switching to a DOR-based regimen,19,20the participants who entered the extensions may have differed from the original cohort in other ways. In addition, long-term evaluation of NPAEs in participants who did not switch to a DOR-based regimen is not within the scope of this analysis. The incidence of headache during the double-blind phase was also similar for the switch groups and the randomized groups: 16.4% versus 15.4% in the DRIVE-AHEAD trial; 11.2% versus 12.0% in the DRIVE-FORWARD trial (see Tables 1 and 2, Supplemental Digital Content,http://links.lww.com/QAI/C419).19,20These similarities in NPAEs and headache, before switching to a DOR-based regimen, suggest that the switch groups were not predisposed to report fewer NPAEs after switching to the DOR-based regimen and that the similar rate of headache and NPAEs with DOR- and DRV/r-based regimens may represent the generalized background rate for these events in people living with HIV.26–30In addition, although participant medical history was requested at the time of enrollment in the trials, the retrospective nature of those data may have resulted in undercounting of pre-existing neuropsychiatric symptoms, resulting in some symptoms being misclassified as emergent, whereas they may have been present at baseline. Nonetheless, this would have likely affected to a greater extent the analysis from the original double-blind study period rather than the analyses examining the open-label extensions. Finally, these post hoc analyses were insufficiently powered for subgroup analyses because of small sample sizes.

None of the DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD trials included a DTG-based regimen as a comparator; therefore, no direct comparison with DTG could be performed based on these trial extensions. However, multiple phase 3 trials evaluating DOR- versus DTG-based regimens for first-line therapy (NCT05924438andNCT06203132) are underway.

Overall, in both trials, NPAEs persisted in ∼3–4% of participants 96 weeks after switching to a DOR-based regimen. Sleep disorders and depression, which may be caused by factors other than tolerability issues, persisted in ∼1–3% of participants, while all other NPAEs persisted in ∼0–1% of participants. This suggests a DOR-based regimen may represent a good option for adults with HIV and baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms or for those experiencing NPAEs with other antiretroviral regimens.
