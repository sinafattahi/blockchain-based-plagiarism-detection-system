Low birth weight has become one of the major health challenges in the world with 19.8 million newborns suffering from it in 2020. Such children stand the risk of dying in their first month of life or are at a high risk of stunted growth, low intelligent quotient and other health challenges as they grow into adulthood. Despite efforts made so far in reducing the proportions of children with low birth weight, the problem persists in sub‐Saharan Africa. This study examined the factors associated with low birth weight among under‐five children in sub‐Saharan Africa.

This study used data sets from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 15 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa. About 58,857 children were involved in the study. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with low birth weight at multivariable level.

Prevalence of low birth weight was 10% in sub‐Saharan Africa with Mauritania (22.9%), Mali (16.5%) and Madagascar (12.2%) having the highest rates. It is most prevalent among children whose mothers have no education (11%), not working (11.5%) and had less than 4 ANC visits (11.4%). The odds of low birth weight increased significantly for children whose mothers belonged to middle and poor households, have no education, were not employed and had less than 4 ANC visits. Female children, children of first order birth and those that belonged to households with unsafe method of stool disposal were more likely to suffer from low birth weight.

The study has revealed that 1 in every 10 children in sub‐Saharan Africa suffered from low birth weight. There is a need for an urgent intervention that would reduce the proportion of children with low birth weight in the region. Such interventions should incorporate efforts to promote female adult and girl‐child education and individual and household socioeconomic status.

Low birth weight has become one of the major health challenges in the world. It is included as a primary outcome indicator in the major set of indicators for the Global Nutrition Monitoring Framework and included as well in the World Health Organization (WHO) Global reference list of 100 health indicators [1]. As of 2020, 19.8 million (14.7%) newborns suffered from low birth weight with the geographical distributions showing the highest rate in South Asia (24.9%) and the lowest rate recorded in Europe and Central Asia (7.6%) [2]. It is emphasized that babies who suffered from low birth weight are more likely to die in their first month of life and those who can survive beyond this period are at a higher risk of stunted growth, low intelligent quotient and other health challenges as they grow into adulthood [2].

To address the problem of low birth weight, plans were made at global level to ensure a 3% relative reduction per year from 2012 to 2025 [3]. It is expected that this will eventually lead to a reduction from about 20 million to 14 million babies with low birth weight [3]. In view of this, certain interventions were recommended by WHO. These interventions include (i) at country or regional level: support for women's empowerment and educational attainment; social protection system; food distribution systems for subpopulations at risk of food insecurity; improvement of clean and adequate water sanitation and hygiene; improvement in facility‐based perinatal care (ii) at community level: adequate nutrition for adolescent girls; community‐based packages of care to improve linkage and referral for facility births; promotion of smoking cessation during and after pregnancy; prevention of malaria during pregnancy (iii) antenatal care intervention for all women: daily iron and folic acid supplements for women during pregnancy; decrease in non‐medically indicated caesarean delivery and induction; fetal growth monitoring and neonatal size evaluation at all levels of care [3].

Despite the above goal and interventions, low birth weight in sub‐Saharan Africa is reported to be about 10% [4]. This is coupled with the fact that the region is home to high infant mortality, which stands at 29% of the global total [5] and stunting among under‐five children which is put at 26% [6]. Many attempts have been made to explain the factors that are responsible for the low‐birth‐weight scenario. For instance, Weyori and others concluded that antenatal care attendance significantly influenced low birth as women who had eight or more antenatal care visits being at lower risk of giving birth to children with low birth weight [7]. Wealth index is another factor identified in the study of Gupta and others as results showed that the odds of low birth weight reduced among children that belonged to the richest wealth quintile compared to children that belonged to the poorest wealth quintile [8]. Other factors include maternal education [9], maternal under nutrition [10], maternal age [11], sex of child [12], lack of nutritional counselling [13], use of iron tablets during pregnancy and place of delivery [14] and toilet facility [15].

Bearing in mind that low birth weight exposes children to the risk of mortality at the early stage of life and chronic health conditions later in life, it is necessary to investigate further the factors influencing its prevalence. This study aims at examining the factors associated with low birth weight among under‐five children in sub‐Saharan Africa. Unlike most previous studies which focused on individual countries, this study pooled data sets of selected countries in sub‐Saharan Africa to obtain robust results which can be applied in settings or regions with similar characteristics. Despite extensive research on maternal and child health disparities in sub‐Saharan Africa, most studies have been limited to single‐country analyses or focused on a narrow set of determinants. This study advances the literature by leveraging pooled data from 15 sub‐Saharan African countries, providing a broader regional perspective on wealth‐ and education‐based inequalities in partner‐controlling behavior. Unlike previous studies, which primarily examine socioeconomic status, this study incorporates underutilized factors such as household sanitation, particularly child stool disposal methods, a critical but often overlooked determinant of child health outcomes. Additionally, by utilizing a large data set (n= 58,857), this study offers more robust and generalizable estimates compared to localized or small‐sample studies. Importantly, the study provides policy‐relevant cross‐country comparisons, identifying disparities across different national contexts and offering insights for regional interventions. These contributions collectively enhance the understanding of structural inequalities influencing maternal and child health outcomes in sub‐Saharan Africa.

In this study, data from Demography and Health Survey (DHS) of 15 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa were pooled. The data were extracted from the children's file (Kids Recode) of all the countries involved, which comprises children that were born 5 years preceding the surveys. The countries were selected based on two criteria: (i) countries with recent data covering the period from 2015 to 2021 and (ii) countries with children who had birth weight recorded for them. In all the countries considered in this study, 58,857 children met the criteria above. DHS is a cross‐sectional survey which consists of information relating to socio‐demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics of men, women and children. DHS surveys employ a two‐stage stratified sampling technique, first selecting enumeration areas (EAs) using probability proportional to size and then selecting households within EAs using systematic random sampling. Data collection is conducted through structured, interviewer‐administered questionnaires, ensuring standardization across countries. Training and supervision of field interviewers help mitigate recall and interviewer biases.

Households were then selected from the EAs in the second stage using a systematic sampling technique. From each household selected, women within the reproductive age 15–49 years were interviewed using a well‐structured and standardized questionnaire. Such women were asked questions relating to themselves and their children. Some of the areas covered in the questionnaire include background information, reproductive history, antenatal care, delivery care, postnatal care, immunization, childhood diseases, types of treatment sought for sick children, mortality, nutrition and domestic violence.

The outcome variable in this study is birth weight which is dichotomized as 1 for children whose birth weight is less than 2.5 kg and 0 for children whose birth weight is 2.5 kg and above. Those with birth weight less than 2.5 kg are regarded as having low birth weight while others are in the non‐low birth weight category. Due to data limitations, it was not possible to distinguish whether LBW was due to preterm birth or small for gestational age (SGA), nor whether SGA cases were symmetrical or asymmetrical. As such, LBW in this study is defined solely as birth weight less than 2.5 kg, in line with WHO and DHS conventions.

The independent variables were selected based on prior literature and their theoretical relevance to low birth weight, including maternal socioeconomic status, antenatal care utilization, and environmental factors such as sanitation. Variables with known biological and social linkages to fetal growth were prioritized.

The independent variables used in this study are derived from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) definitions to ensure consistency and comparability across similar studies.

Mother's Age: Categorized into three age groups—15–24 years, 25–34 years, and 35+ years—to capture variations in maternal experience and exposure to healthcare services.

Education Level: Defined as the highest level of schooling attained, categorized as none, primary, and secondary/higher education, following DHS classifications.

Household Wealth: Measured using the DHS wealth index, which ranks households based on asset ownership, housing materials, and access to utilities. Households are grouped into quintiles: poorest, poorer, middle, richer, and richest.

Place of Residence: Categorized as urban or rural, indicating the mother's living environment, which often influences access to healthcare and resources.

Employment Status: Indicates whether the mother was engaged in any form of paid or unpaid work in the past 12 months, categorized as not working or working.

Media Exposure: Based on whether the mother has access to information via radio, television, or newspapers at least once a week (exposed) or not at all (not exposed).

Sex of Child: The biological sex of the child, recorded as male or female.

Number of Under‐Five Children in Household: The total count of children under age five living in the household, categorized as ≤ 4 children or ≥ 5 children to assess potential resource constraints.

Antenatal Care Attendance (ANC): The number of visits made during pregnancy, categorized as no visit, less than four visits, and four or more visits, in accordance with WHO and DHS guidelines.

Birth Order: Refers to the sequence of the child's birth, classified as first‐order birth, second‐order birth, and third or higher‐order birth, which may influence maternal healthcare utilization.

Iron Pill Consumption During Pregnancy: Indicates whether the mother took iron supplements during pregnancy, classified as yes or no, an important measure for maternal nutrition.

Source of Drinking Water: Categorized as improved (e.g., piped water, boreholes, protected wells) or non‐improved (e.g., surface water, unprotected sources), following DHS and WHO classifications of safe drinking water.

Type of Toilet Facility: Classified as improved (e.g., flush toilets, ventilated improved pit latrines) or non‐improved (e.g., open defecation, pit latrines without a slab), based on sanitation standards.

Child's Stool Disposal Method: Indicates whether a child's feces are disposed of in a hygienic manner (safe disposal, e.g., in a toilet or buried) or in an unhygienic way (unsafe disposal, e.g., left in the open), an important measure of household sanitation practices.

After pooling datasets of the 15 countries together and applying weighting factor(v0051000000)to clear the data from the effects of under‐enumeration and over‐enumeration that occurred during the surveys, the main analysis was carried out. The first stage of the analysis involved the use of percentages to describe the proportion of children with low birth weight in each of the countries. In the second stage, the association between low birth weight and each of the independent variables was considered usingχ2test. Multivariable analysis was performed in the third stage using binary logistic regression. The crude odds ratios, adjusted odds ratios, confidence intervals and levels of significance were thereafter obtained. The level of significance denoted byαwas set at 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001. All statistical operations were done using Stata statistical software version 15. To account for confounding, a variance inflation factor (VIF) test was conducted before running the logistic regression models. All VIF values were below 5, indicating an acceptable level of multicollinearity among independent variables. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of ICF and host country IRBs reviewed and approved the respective DHS surveys. All surveys in this study were conducted with those approvals and survey participants gave consent verbally. The IRB of ICF complied with the United States Department of Health and Human Services regulations for the protection of human research subjects (45 CFR 46). Before survey release, all DHS data sets were anonymized. All ethical consideration concerning the use of secondary data set for publication were adhered to.

Table1shows the distribution of low‐birth‐weight prevalence among under‐five children in the countries considered in the study. The table shows that countries with the highest prevalence of children with low birth weight are Mauritania (22.9%), Mali (16.5%) and Madagascar (12.2%). In Table2, results show that 10% of children in sub‐Saharan Africa experienced low birth weight. Close to 12% of children whose mothers were 15–24 years of age and 11% of those whose mothers reported having no education experienced low birth weight. The higher the level of poverty in households, the more the number of children with low birth weight as the proportion of children with low birth weight is highest among those from middle (10.8%), poorer (10.6%) and poorest (10.6%) households. While proportion of children with low birth weight is higher among nonworking women (11.5%), women without media exposure have higher proportion (10.7%) of children with low birth weight compared to children of women with media exposure. With respect to antenatal care, results show that 1 in every 10 children born to women who never attended antenatal care has low birth weight. There are more female children with low birth weight (11.2%) than male children (8.7%). Higher proportions of children with low birth weight are found in households with five or more under‐five children (12.6%) and among children of first order birth (12.2%). Low birth weight is more prevalent among children living in households with non‐improved toilet facility and unsafe stool disposal method (11.6%).

Table3shows results from multivariable analysis which highlight the factors associated with low birth weight among under‐five children. The results reveal that the odds of having children with low birth weight increased by 42% for women that have no education compared to their counterparts with secondary or higher education. The chances of having children with low birth weight reduced by 19% among children from richer households. While the odds of having children with low birth weight increased by 19% among nonworking women compared to working women, the odds increased by 31% for female children compared to male children. Children of women who attended antenatal care less than four times are 35% more likely to experience low birth weight compared to children of women who attended antenatal care four or more times. Also, first order birth children are 55 times more likely to experience low birth weight than their counterparts who are of third or higher order birth. The chances of experiencing low birth weight increased by 31% for children from households with unsafe method of stool disposal compared to children from households with safe method of stool disposal.

This study focused on factors that are associated with low birth weight among under‐five children in sub‐Saharan Africa. Results indicated that 1 in 10 children in the region experienced low birth weight. Mother's level of education has been found to contribute significantly to this prevalence. Children of uneducated women are more likely to experience low birth weight than children whose mothers have secondary or higher education. This is in line with findings from previous studies where it was emphasized that pregnant women with a higher level of education could easily adjust their biological, psychological and behavioural characteristics contributing to poor nutrition, smoking and physical labour better than their uneducated counterparts [16,17,18,19,20,21]. Household wealth or income is another factor that influences low birth weight among children. It has been shown that the chances of having children with low birth weight reduced for children in richer households compared to children from poor households. This has been attributed to the fact that poor households are faced with challenges which put them in a disadvantaged socioeconomic condition. Such challenges include lack of access to nutritious food, poor sanitation and environmental conditions which consequently contribute to poor health conditions of such households [22,23,24,25,26,27]. In addition, it has been emphasized that women from poor households, often, have limited access to quality maternal health services such as antenatal and delivery care which can induce serious health conditions that will have effect on the fetal growth and development and result into low birth weight [22]. Results further revealed that low birth weight is more prevalent among children of nonworking women. This has been reported in a previous study [28]. This may be linked to the notion that nonworking women may be disadvantaged in terms of financial independence which could limit their opportunity to enjoy adequate medical care during pregnancy. This may eventually lead to poor pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight.

The observed variation in low‐birth‐weight prevalence across the 15 sub‐Saharan African countries included in this study is driven by multiple factors, reflecting disparities in maternal healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and data collection methodologies.

First, healthcare system disparities play a crucial role. Countries with higher access to quality maternal healthcare services, including comprehensive antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance, and postnatal monitoring, tend to report lower rates of low birth weight. For instance, Mauritania (22.9%) and Mali (16.5%)—which recorded the highest prevalence rates—also have lower ANC utilization rates and higher maternal undernutrition levels compared to Rwanda (6.2%) and Sierra Leone (4.8%), where healthcare interventions have improved over time.

Second, socioeconomic and nutritional differences between countries contribute to these variations. Low birth weight is closely linked to maternal malnutrition, which is more prevalent in food‐insecure regions. Countries with weaker food security policies and higher poverty rates are more likely to have increased low birth weight cases due to inadequate maternal nutrition during pregnancy.

Third, survey methodology and data collection variations influence reported prevalence rates. While the DHS program uses standardized data collection protocols, the mode of birth weight reporting differs across countries. In settings with high institutional delivery rates, birth weight is often recorded by health professionals, leading to more accurate data. Conversely, in countries where a significant proportion of deliveries occur at home, birth weight is typically reported based on maternal recall, which is prone to misclassification and underreporting of low‐birth‐weight cases.

Lastly, sociocultural factors such as traditional birthing practices and variations in maternal health‐seeking behaviors also contribute to these discrepancies. In some contexts, limited maternal health literacy or reliance on traditional birth attendants may result in lower detection and reporting of low‐birth‐weight cases.

Given these complex, multi‐layered factors, conducting a country‐specific sub‐analysis would require adjusting for diverse structural and health system differences, which is beyond the scope of this study. However, these variations underscore the need for country‐specific policy interventions to address low birth weight through targeted maternal health and nutrition programs.

The sex of a child is another factor influencing low birth weight as female children are more likely to experience low birth weight than male children. This has also been found in previous studies with the explanation that there is a high level of intolerance for maternal glucose among female fetuses which invariably affects their weight at birth [12,29,30,31]. The role of antenatal care on low birth weight featured prominently in the study as children of women who attended antenatal care less than four times are more likely to experience low birth weight compared to their counterparts whose mothers attended antenatal care four or more times. Reports indicate that antenatal visits contribute to women's diet during pregnancy which enhances a healthy weight gain [32,33,34,35]. This is further underscored by the fact that women who attend antenatal care are exposed to routine examination of themselves and their fetuses coupled with the fact that they would receive adequate health information on how to practice good health habits that limit the tendency to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight [14]. In the same vein, it is opined that as women attend antenatal care sessions, they tend to gain more maternal and child health knowledge, they would be screened for risk factors of low‐birth‐weight, and they would embark on requisite preventive measures [7]. Prevalence of low birth weight is higher among children of first order birth compared to children of second or higher order birth. This is in tandem with results from previous studies in which it was stated that most mothers at the time of first birth are young and inexperienced and as such they know little about their health needs and what could contribute to the well‐being of the fetuses [9,36]. Method of stool disposal is significantly associated with low birth weight. Children from households with unsafe method of stool disposal are more likely to experience low birth weight than children from households with safe method of stool disposal. Similar results have been reported in a previous study in which low birth weight was more prevalent among children whose households used open dump to disposal their solid waste [37]. It was emphasized that such poor toilet facilities expose women to infections that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight [37].

Achieving the third goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS), which is focused on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well‐being for all at all age, requires improvement not only in the health of adults but also the children. Child's weight at birth is an important measure of child well‐being. The low birth weight recorded in the countries understudy, which shows a prevalence of 1 in 10 children, indicates that much needs to be done to improve child health in sub‐Saharan Africa. Since the role of education in child's birth weight featured prominently in the study, it will be a worthwhile intervention if level of education among women is improved. This may be achieved by reviewing existing programmes on girl‐child education in each country and identifying areas where much progress has not been recorded. A new approach to ensuring improvement in girl‐child education may then be introduced. Special programme on adult education can be organized for women who missed the opportunity of receiving formal education but who are willing to become literate. Improving the economic status of women at individual and household levels is another intervention that can lead to a reduction in the proportion of children with low birth weight. One way of achieving this is embarking on economic programmes that would make women self‐employed. Part of the programmes should ensure provision of interest‐free loan facilities to women to engage in any entrepreneurial activities they desire. With improved economic status, women will have access to quality maternal health services, nutritious food and clean environment. Because of its numerous benefits both to the pregnant women and their fetuses, adequate antenatal care attendance should be given more attention. Interventions that will promote both increase in the number of women attending ANC and the number of visits should be applied. For instance, interventions such as health awareness campaign at community and household levels and use of mobile technology may be adopted. While the former has the potential of increasing the number of women that will attend ANC generally, the latter will facilitate meeting the recommended minimum number of ANC visits. To reduce the incidence of poor method of stool disposal, efforts on the maintenance of clean environment and the provision of improved toilet facility need to be intensified by appropriate government agency. Such agency should ensure that each house is equipped with toilet facility that meets the minimum standard set.

It is to be noted that this study is limited to 15 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa. The reason for this is that only countries with surveys conducted from 2015 to 2021 were considered and this helped in reducing variations that may occur when the years are too far apart. Including more countries in the analysis would have provided more insights into the prevalence of low birth weight among children in sub‐Saharan Africa. Since the study used a secondary data, only variables available in the datasets were used which resulted in leaving out other relevant variables not found in the datasets. In particular, important maternal health variables such as hypertension, gestational diabetes, and infections during pregnancy—known contributors to LBW—were not consistently captured across DHS surveys. Including these variables would have resulted in substantial missing data and compromised comparability across countries. Future research leveraging facility‐based datasets or cohort studies is needed to investigate the role of these clinical factors in more depth. While these factors may influence maternal and child health outcomes, the scope of this study was limited to variables with comprehensive and reliable data. Future research should explore datasets that systematically capture maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, and underlying health conditions to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their potential impact on maternal and child well‐being. A further limitation is the inability to differentiate between low birth weight due to preterm birth and that due to small for gestational age, as DHS datasets do not consistently provide gestational age or relevant clinical indicators.

Despite these limitations, the study used the most recent datasets of countries in sub‐Saharan Africa which places the results in the current context. Also, the study involved large datasets which provide the opportunity for the findings to be generalized.

This study has revealed that low birth weight is still a major health challenge among children in sub‐Saharan Africa. It is also highlighted that low birth weight is associated with lack of maternal education, household poverty, unemployment, female child, poor antenatal care attendance, first order birth and poor method of stool disposal. Interventions to reduce the proportion of children with low birth weight should be urgently embarked upon in the region. Such interventions should incorporate programmes that would improve female adult and girl‐child education, individual and household socioeconomic status, antenatal care attendance and household environmental conditions.
