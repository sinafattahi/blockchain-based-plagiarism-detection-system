Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries and is strongly associated with several metabolic disorders. Plant-derived bioactive extracts, such as berry extracts, with high antioxidant capacity have been used for the treatment and prevention of this pathology. Moreover, they promote circular economy and sustainability.

To study the beneficial effects of extracts from different parts of berry plants in animal models of NAFLD.

A systematic research of the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane, and Scopus databases was conducted to identify relevant studies published after January 2011. In vivo animal studies of NAFLD were included in which berry extracts of different parts of the plant were administered and significantly improved altered biomarkers related to the pathology, such as lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis, glucose and glycogen metabolism, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biomarkers.

Of a total of 203 articles identified, 31 studies were included after implementation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Most of the studies showed a decrease in steatosis and a stimulation of genes related to β-oxidation and downregulation of lipogenic genes, with administration of berry extracts. Berry extracts also attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress.

Administration of berry extracts seems to have promising potential in the design of enriched foodstuffs or nutraceuticals for the treatment of NAFLD.

Berries represent a variety of small fruits with different colors, such as red, purple and blue.7The most commonly consumed are blackberries (Rubusspp.), red raspberries (R. idaeus), black raspberries (R. occidentalis), blueberries (Vacciniumspp.), cranberries (V. macrocarpon), bilberries (V. myrtillus), blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum), and strawberries (Fragariaspp.). Less commonly consumed berries include chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa), açai berries (Euterpe oleraceae), goji berries (Lycium barbarum), Indian gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblicaL.), and mulberries (Morus alba).18–22Furthermore, another widely cultivated fruit with antioxidant properties, which could be considered a berry, is the grape (Vitis viniferaL.).23They are consumed both as fresh products as well as processed foods (eg, juices, beverages, jams, freeze-dried).24In general, berries exhibit a remarkable polyphenol content including flavonoids, condensed tannins, hydrolyzable tannins, phenolic acids, stilbenoids, and lignans,18,25although their concentration may vary according to species, genotype, and growing and post-harvesting conditions.22Nowadays, the development of dietary supplements based on concentrated extracts or nutraceuticals that combine different plant extracts to acquire optimal nutritional value is growing rapidly. Therefore, there is a need to identify plants that can fulfill this purpose. In this regard, the products of berry cultivation (fruits as well as different plant components like leaves, stem, or roots) are revealing increasing potential.

Considering the need to develop nutritional therapeutic strategies to combat NAFLD, our aim for this systematic review was to examine research in animal models, published in the academic literature, that studied the benefits that extracts from different parts of berry plants can offer to revert metabolic alterations caused by the onset of NAFLD. The inclusion of animal studies allows us to compare results not only in plasma but other tissues, and to analyze the key mechanisms responsible for the observed effects. Putting together these findings can help establish a wide base of knowledge that will guide and encourage the design of clinical studies including different extracts of berries, or even a combination of them, for the treatment of NAFLD.

The resulting algorithm was ((Plant Extracts[MeSH Terms]) AND ((((((((((((((((((Actaea[MeSH Terms]) OR (Arctostaphylos[MeSH Terms])) OR (Euterpe[MeSH Terms])) OR (Fragaria[MeSH Terms])) OR (Hippophae[MeSH Terms])) OR (Mahonia[MeSH Terms])) OR (Morus[MeSH Terms])) OR (Photinia[MeSH Terms])) OR (Phyllanthus[MeSH Terms])) OR (Prunus[MeSH Terms])) OR (Ribes[MeSH Terms])) OR (Rubus[MeSH Terms])) OR (Sambucus[MeSH Terms])) OR (Ulmus[MeSH Terms])) OR (Viburnum[MeSH Terms])) OR (Vitis[MeSH Terms])) OR (Vaccinium[MeSH Terms])) OR (Lycium[MeSH Terms]))) AND ((((((((((((((Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease[MeSH Terms]) OR (Fatty Liver, Nonalcoholic[Title/Abstract])) OR (Fatty Livers, Nonalcoholic[Title/Abstract])) OR (Liver, Nonalcoholic Fatty[Title/Abstract])) OR (Livers, Nonalcoholic Fatty[Title/Abstract])) OR (NAFLD[Title/Abstract])) OR (Non alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease[Title/Abstract])) OR (Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver[Title/Abstract])) OR (Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease[Title/Abstract])) OR (Nonalcoholic Fatty Livers[Title/Abstract])) OR (Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitides[Title/Abstract])) OR (Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis[Title/Abstract])) OR (Steatohepatitides, Nonalcoholic[Title/Abstract])) OR (Steatohepatitis, Nonalcoholic[Title/Abstract])).

The same algorithm, with some adaptations when needed, was used in the different databases (Appendix S1). Next, a list of relevant studies was made, avoiding duplicated articles, and it was completed by searching the reference list of selected publications and implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The systematic review was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines20(Table S1). The period of the search was set to the 10 years inclusive of January 2011 to December 2021, to include the most recent information on the subject. The use of high-nutritional foods and plant extracts in studies of metabolic diseases have increased in recent years. Therefore, the Burton-Kebler index was used for obsolescence to help us include the most current scientific texts published on this topic according to the median age or median production.21In addition, the term “NAFLD” was used in the search instead of “MAFLD” (for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease), because the latter was proposed in 2020. Established PICOS criteria for the included studies are shown inTable 1.

Two of this study’s authors (A.G.-B. and A.L.M.) carried out the first screening of the literature separately, reviewed the abstracts of the retrieved articles, and selected the appropriate ones for further full-text examination. At this point, bibliographic reviews, epidemiological studies, editorials, case reports, and book chapters were excluded. There were no language restrictions so all relevant studies could be included. In the second stage of the selection process, the same 2 authors examined the full-text articles and decided which should be included in the review. Because the aim of this work was to review the existing data on animal intervention studies, in vitro studies as well as human clinical trials were manually excluded at this point.Figure 1shows the flow diagram of the selection process for this systematic review.

Flow Diagram for Systematic Reviews (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020).

After the study selection, the same 2 authors independently reviewed and extracted information from the selected articles. Risk-of-bias assessment was conducted in accordance with a tool developed for animal studies by the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation.22Moreover, the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines26for reporting animal research were used to evaluate the quality of the studies according to García-González et al.27Briefly, the evaluation of the 21 items (formed by different subitems) included the use of the following scale: “reported” (2 points) if the publication complied with all subitems; “not reported” (0 points) if it did not; and “unclear” (1 point) if the details were not provided for all the subitems. In this way, a predefined quality coefficient (excellent, 0.8-1; average, 0.5-0.8; poor, <0.5) was applied to each study, calculated as the sum of the points obtained and divided by 42 (the maximum possible points). Studies with a quality coefficient <0.5 were excluded. The agreement between the 2 reviewers was acceptable according to the Cohen κ statistical test28(κ > 0.60).29Any discrepancies were resolved in consensus between A.G.-B. and A.L.M. or between 2 other authors (R.M.M. and G.K.), if necessary.

As shown inFigure 1, 203 studies were identified in the initial systematic search of the different databases. After the exclusion of duplicated studies, 109 potentially eligible studies were found. The first screening resulted in the exclusion of other bibliographic reviews (n= 19) and book chapters (n= 2). The remaining eligible studies were then reduced to 88. The second screening, which was manually performed, resulted in the exclusion of articles without full-text access (n= 1), another topic irrelevant to this review (n= 1), and articles on studies including humans (n= 5), exclusively in vitro studies (n= 9), studies including alcoholic fatty liver disease (n= 5), studies that did not include berries in the intervention (n = 2), studies that combined a mix of several berries extracts or their nutraceuticals (n= 11), studies that included a berry consumption as an intervention but not administered as an extract (n= 21), and 5 articles that failed the quality scale. After the second screening, 28 eligible articles remained. Next, the reference lists of these 28 articles were checked for articles that met the inclusion criteria and did not appear in the initial search. Finally, 3 more articles were added, and the final number of eligible studies was 31. The interobserver raw agreement was calculated at 88.89% (k= 0.647).

Upon examining these 31 articles, we found that over the past 10 years, most of the studies have focused on antioxidant activity of extracts from species of the generaMorus(n= 9)6,30–37andRubus(n= 5).9,38–41The plant material mostly used to obtain the extracts was the fruit (n= 10),4,31,36,37,40,42–45followed by leaves (n= 6),6,23,30,32–34seeds (n= 3),2,3,46and roots (n= 2).39,41In contrast, the whole plant (n= 2),1,47skin (n= 1),48pulp or pomace (n= 2),38,49or root bark (n= 1)35have been seldom studied. Two of the retrieved articles did not mention the source of the plant material used for their intervention,5,50and 2 studies used a mixture of different parts from the plant fruits and leaves9or seed and skin.51The chemical composition of the extracts was reported in 221–6,9,31–33,36–39,41–43,46,48–51of the 31 articles described in this review (Table 2).

The biological effects of the berry extracts in different animal models are summarized inTable 3. Male (n= 27)1–3,5,6,9,23,30–32,34–44,46–49,51,52and female (n= 2)4,50rodents were selected as animal models to study NAFLD. In 1 study, both male and female animals were included (n= 1)45; in 1 study, the sex was not mentioned.32Fourteen articles studied the effect of berry extract administration on mice.2–5,30–32,34,40,42,43,45,52In the remaining 17 articles, the animal model used was rat.1,5,6,23,33,35–39,41,44,46,47,49–51The induction of NAFLD was mainly carried out by the inclusion of a high-fat diet (HFD) in different fat percentages (n= 15)2,3,5,9,30–32,34,36,38,40,43,44,48,51; the combination of a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFD-HCD) (n= 6)1,6,37,39,41,47; or a Western-type (n= 1)4or cafeteria diet (n= 1).49In 2 studies, hepatic steatosis was also induced by an HFD plus streptozotocin (n= 2)35,46or an orotic acid diet (n= 1).33Other strategies also included a methionine choline–deficient diet alone (n= 3)42,45,52to induce this pathology or in combination with sodium nitrite injection (n= 1).18Only 1 study did not develop a diet-induced NAFLD model (n= 1)50but instead used ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats to study the risk of NAFLD development due to estrogen deficit.

The most common form of berry extract administration was by oral gavage (n= 17)1,5,23,30–35,37,39,42,44,45,47,48,52; other studies mixed it with the rodent diet (n= 9)4,6,9,36,38,40,43,49,50or used intragastric administration (n= 4)2,3,41,46or intraperitoneal administration (n = 1).51After reviewing the collected studies, we found most of them used berry extract as the sole intervention. Nevertheless, in 1 article, the treatment with berry extract was combined with a protocol of physical activity,46and in others, berry extracts were co-administered with β-glucan,30silk amino acids,36and fructo-oligosaccharides or pectins38to enhance their activity.

The treatment period varied among articles, ranging from <4 weeks (n= 4),23,41,45,47to 4-8 weeks (n= 8),1,2,39,42,46,49,51,529-13 weeks (n= 14),3,5,6,9,30,32,34,36–38,40,43,48,50or 14-24 weeks (n= 4).31,35,39,44In 1 article, this period was not specified.33The most common duration of the treatment was 12 weeks (n= 10).3,5,9,30,32,34,36,38,48,50The obtained results of the different genera of the berries included in the retrieved studies are presented next.

As shown inTable 3, 4 of the retrieved studies assayed the antioxidant activity of berries belonging to theEuterpegenus on Wistar rats,46,49C57BL/62and C57BL/6J3mice with NAFLD during 42,46,49or 12 weeks.3These articles reported on studies of the seeds extracts ofE. oleraceaMart.2,3,46and the pulp ethyl ether extract ofE. edulis.49The intragastric administration of 2 doses (200 mg kg-1d-146and 300 mg kg-1d-12,3) ofE. oleraceaor the inclusion ofE. edulisoil (4%), pulp, or defatted pulp (5% and 10%) in the diet resulted in a decrease in body weight (BW),2,3liver weight, and hepatic steatosis of the animals.2,3,46,47In addition, they reduced hepatic and serum2,3,46levels of total cholesterol (TC), TGs, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as well as hepatic lipogenic gene expression (Srebf1,Hmgcr,Acaca).3,46However,E. edulisextracts increased serum TC levels.47Different effects on antioxidant enzyme activities were reported in response to the inclusion of the extracts. In 1 case, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxide (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities decreased,2,49whereas SOD, GPx, and CAT activities increased in the other 2 articles.3,46In addition, a decrease in glutathioneS-transferase (GST) enzymatic activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were also observed.38Furthermore, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity3,46and the expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8, transporters responsible for biliary and transintestinal secretion of cholesterol and dietary sterols,3were increased. de Bem et al46studied the combination of the administration of berry extract with physical activity, and they observed an improvement of the beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, reducing hepatic lipogenic proteins and cholesterol transporters.

Two of the 4 studies of the genusPhyllanthusused the whole plant to produce a functional extract ofP. niruri,1,47and the remaining 2 used extracts fromP. emblicaL. fruit.44,52These extracts were tested on Sprague-Dawley rats1,44,47and C57BL/6Narl mice,52using doses from 125 to 1000 mg kg-1BW by oral gavage.Phyllanthusextracts reduced serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST),1,44,52and visceral, peritoneal, and epididymal fat.1,44In addition, administration of the extracts increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GST, SOD, and GPx) in liver and plasma,44,52and downregulated hepatic gene expression of inflammatory (Tnfa,Il1b,Nr1h3/Lxra)44,52and lipogenic (Srebf1)44markers. Al Zarzour et al1observed that all doses of 50% methanol extract (1000, 500, and 250 mg kg-1d-1) ofP. nirurisignificantly improved serum parameters, and the highest dose significantly improved the histological parameters. Together with these results, Al Zarzour et al47observed that the extract reduced micro- and macrovesicular steatosis and fibrosis in the liver; decreased serum levels of TNF-α, RBP4, vaspin, and IL-6; and increased adiponectin serum levels.

TheRibesgenus was studied in 1 article. A commercial extract ofR. nigrumL. was used.50Different concentrations of berry extract (10, 100, and 200 mg kg-1) were administered by oral gavage to C57BL/6 mice. Higher doses improved NAFLD status, decreased hepatic steatosis, and reduced body and visceral fat weight. In addition, it also reduced TC, TG, LDL, adiponectin, and leptin serum levels. The highest extract dose decreased hepaticTnfa,Il6, andIl1bmRNA expression and increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein.

Most of the articles (n= 8) reporting on research of this genus focused onMorus albaL. extracts from different plant parts, such as leaves (n= 5),6,30,32–34fruit (n= 2),36,37and root bark (n= 1)35and 1 onM. nigraL. fruit.31C57BL/6,32,33C57BL/6J,48and C57BL/6N mice,34and Wistar6and Sprague-Dawley33,35–37rats were used as animals models to testMorusextracts effects on NAFLD. In mice models, the doses used were between 100 and 600 mg kg-1, whereas in rats, they ranged from 0.05 to 10 g kg-1.Morusextracts decreased body and liver weight,6,31,33,34,36liver steatosis, TG levels,30,31,36,37lipogenic metabolism, and inflammatory status.6,32–37Moreover, extracts enhanced lipid β-oxidation via increasedCpt1agene expression.6,36Regarding liver oxidative status,Morusextract decreased NADPH oxidase activity,37TBARS, and ROS levels6,30and increased SOD, GST, and glutathione disulfide antioxidant enzymatic activity.6,30–34,36,37Likewise, fat weight was also decreased.6,30–32,36Furthermore, the administration of the different extracts reduced serum levels of ALT, AST, TC, TG, LDL,6,30–32,35leptin,6,31and adiponectin,6and improved glucose metabolism decreasing glucose and insulin serum levels, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (after oral glucose tolerance test) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA)-IR and HOMA for insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IS).31,35,36Finally, the results observed by Xu et al30after the berry extract administration were enhanced with the inclusion of β-glucan (200 mg kg-1d-1).

Five of the retrieved articles reported on studies of different species and plant portions belonging to the genusRubus. Two of them evaluated the effects of root extracts fromRubus aleaefoliusPoir,39,411 of them included raspberry pomace (Rubusspp.) extracted with 30% acetone,38and the other used fruits and leaves of blackberry (Rubusspp.), using 50% ethyl alcohol as solvent.9A commercial fruit extract ofR. coreanuswas also used.40Rubusextracts were assayed on different models, such as Wistar38and Sprague-Dawley rats,9,39,41and on C57BL/6 mice.40The extract was administered mostly by oral gavage,38–40in the diet,9or by intragastric injection,41using doses between 0.1 and 1.44 g kg-1BW per day.Rubusextracts decreased body40,41and liver weight,40liver steatosis,9,39,41as well as epididymal and retroperitoneal fat.9,40Furthermore,Rubusextracts reduced plasma and/or serum levels of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, TC, TG, and LDL,9,38–41and improved glucose metabolism, resulting in a decrease of insulin and AUC of serum glucose levels during either glucose or insulin tolerance testing.9In addition, lipogenic metabolism and inflammatory status in the liver was improved,9,38–41and lipid β-oxidation was favored by an increase inCpt1agene expression.9,39,40In addition, the hepatic antioxidant capacity was also increased by SOD and glutathione reductase (GSH) enzymatic activity afterRubusextract administration.9Fotschki et al38observed that benefits ofRubusspp. extracts were enhanced by the inclusion of fructo-oligosaccharides (3%) and pectins (3%).

One of the retrieved studies5focused onAronia melanocarpa, formerlyPhotinia melanocarpa. The effects of a 50 mg kg-1d-1dose (orally administered) of a commercial ethanolic extract (portion not specified) were tested on male C57BL/6N mice for 12 weeks. Results included a reduction in BW, liver weight, and serum levels of AST, ALT, and leptin. The extract also caused a reduction in hepatic lipid deposition, hepatic levels of TG and Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS), and in hepaticPparg2,Fabp4, andLplmRNA and protein expression. On the other hand, SOD enzymatic activity and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity increased after the consumption of this extract.

One of the 3 articles reporting on studies involving the genusVitisfocused on aV. coignetiaeaqueous extract of leaves,23and the other 2 articles reported on studies ofV. viniferaextracts of skin and a mixture of seed and skin, using water48and ethanol51as solvents, respectively. The doses administered (100, 300, 200, or 500 mg kg-1d-1) were tested in Wistar rats23,51and C57BL/6 mice.48Reductions in BW, epididymal and retroperitoneal fat mass, as well as hepatic steatosis23,48,51were observed. Liver weight was reduced in 2 studies,48,51althoughV. coignetiaeincreased this parameter.23In addition, hepatic levels of TG and TC48,51were decreased, whereas AMPK antioxidant enzymatic activity (GPx, SOD, CAT) were increased.48,51Furthermore, Santos et al48observed thatV. viniferaaqueous extract improved insulin resistance via reduction of glucose and serum insulin levels, increased expression of hepatic insulin cascade proteins, and resulted in a decrease in hepatic lipogenic factors.V. coignetiae23treatment showed a beneficial effect on NAFLD by reducing the percentage of fibrosis area and NF-κB expression. Oxidative status was also improved, as seen by increased plasma antioxidant activity.

Therefore,Vitisgenus treatments presented beneficial effects on the treatment of NAFLD.V. viniferashowed positive effects in lipid and glucose metabolism, whereasV. coignetiaecontributed to modulate the interaction between inflammation and oxidative stress.

In the present systematic review, we aimed to provide a complete description of the benefits of berry extracts on NAFLD. Antioxidant properties of the berries and their therapeutic use to treat different metabolic pathologies are well known. Kowalska and Olejnik53reviewed the beneficial effects of berry fruits in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, showing their antioxidant effect and potential to treat obesity and diabetes, improve hepatic and plasma lipid profile, and protect against NAFLD through the modulation of lipogenic and inflammatory genes. Keeping in mind the importance of circular economy, in this review, the beneficial effects of berry extracts made from other parts of the plant in addition to fruit were gathered that have beneficial properties against metabolic diseases.

After performing an extensive screening, 31 articles were included, using extracts from numerous genera (Euterpe,Vaccinium,Phyllanthus,Ribes,Morus,Rubus,Photinia,Lycium, andVitis)whose fruit are considered berries. These species are commonly used for nutritional purposes and most are consumed worldwide. Extracts were obtained using different methodologies and from different parts of the plants. This systematic review is a first attempt, to our knowledge, to collect information on the impact that extracts of different plant components of berries have on NAFLD and its associated metabolic outcomes. The available information was organized so that future studies could take it into account. According ARRIVE guidelines, the quality of the retrieved studies was good, although there was great heterogeneity among them.

The plant materials most used to obtain the functional extracts were the fruit and leaves. The most common berry extract administration was by oral gavage, followed by its inclusion in the diet. Moreover, no toxicity effects of the administration of berries in any form were reported. The most common study treatment period was between 9 and 13 weeks, and doses ranged from 50 to 1000 mg kg-1. The extraction process is critical for the isolation of bioactive compounds and depends on the intended use of the final products.56The most frequently used solvents in the studies in this systematic review were water and ethanol with different purity percentages (Table 2). In general, regardless of the type of plant portion, most of the compounds isolated were polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. In the genusMorus, Peng et al6reported that, through water extraction, the main identified components were neochlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic, and chlorogenic acid, whereas Ann et al32using ethanol as the solvent and identified 1-deoxynojirimycin and resveratrol. Using another part of the plant and the same solvents,M. alba36,37andM. nigra31fruit extracts contained cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. It seemed thatM. alba36water extract had a higher content of polyphenols, whereasM. nigra31ethanolic extract had more flavonoids. InRubusspp., chloroform:methanol:ammonia extracts from roots39,41were mainly composed of carbohydrates and alkaloids, whereas the acetone:water extract ofRubuspomace38had a high polyphenol content.Euterpespp.2,3,46,49presented remarkably high anthocyanidin and anthocyanin content in seeds and pulp when either hydroalcoholic or soxhlet extraction was carried out, respectively. Similar results were obtained in different members ofVaccinium.4,43Finally, bioactive compounds present inVitis viniferaseeds and skin have been studied by Charradi et al51and Santos et al,48who found that seeds were mainly composed of polyphenols (gallic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid), whereas skin contained mostly anthocyanins.

The development of NAFLD by the theory of 2 “hits” or stages is widespread. The first hit is triggered by TG accumulation in hepatocytes, caused by exacerbated fat intake and insulin resistance. This condition increases the liver's vulnerability to other damaging factors, such as increased levels of oxidative stress, activation of inflammatory pathways, and the onset of fibrosis, collectively referred to as the second hit.57The most widely studied parameters related to NAFLD are liver weight, hepatic steatosis, hepatic and serum TG and TC levels, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory status. In this regard, a summary of the most representative effects of berry extracts on the alterations of NAFLD are summarized inFigure 2.

Hepatic fat deposition ensues as an unbalance among hepatic FA synthesis, de novo lipogenesis (DNL), hepatic availability of free fatty acids (FFAs) from hepatic lipolysis, and lipid exportation from the liver in the form of triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein. FFAs can be generated from several pathways, including increased hepatic DNL, delivery of FFAs from adipose tissue lipolysis, delivery of dietary fat, and reduced FA oxidation.58Regarding the effect of the functional plant extracts on the liver, a general decrease in liver weight and steatosis caused by a decrease in lipid deposition has been observed,2,5,6,32,33,36–39,42,43,45,48,51together with a reduction in macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis,1,3,4,9,31,33,34,36,39,41,43,45–47,51and TG1,3,6,9,30,31,33,36,37,40,42,46,48,51and TC hepatic content.1,3,4,6,30,31,33,36,38,39,46,48,51In addition, administration of berry extracts led to a general decrease in plasma and serum TG,2,6,30,32,35–41,46,50TC,1–3,6,30–32,35–37,39–41,46,50LDL,1–3,6,30–32,36,37,39–41,44,50and very-low-density lipoprotein2,3,46content. Therefore, berry extracts could improve NAFLD by acting against the first hit hypothesis, decreasing plasma and serum leptin levels, preventing insulin resistance, and inhibiting lipogenesis.3,5,6,30,40,50Liver-weight reduction is a biomarker related to an improvement of NAFLD.57Berry extracts improved this biomarker with the exception of 2 studies in which liver weight was increased.23,38Although Pak et al23observed an increase in the relative liver weight, theVitis coignetiaePulliat. leaves extract alleviated liver fibrosis, improving nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by, theoretically, inhibition of the second hit.

The most common risk factor for NAFLD development and progression is insulin resistance.61Systemic insulin resistance is characterized by the inability of insulin to reduce blood glucose levels appropriately, whereas hepatic insulin resistance is caused by interrupting hepatic glucose production but increasing lipogenesis stimulation. Insulin is also a key inhibitor of hepatic glucose production by suppression of glucose production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Therefore, insulin resistance induces an elevation of glycogenolysis and an increase in hepatic glycolytic intermediates, which lead to raised glycolysis.58Despite its importance, only 2 studies included the effect of berry extracts on glycogen deposition.9,36In both articles, berry extracts increased glycogen content in NAFLD rats. In 1 study, blackberry leaf extract enhanced glycogen content more than the fruit extract, whereas in the second study, a high ratio or high dose ofMorus albaextract in combination with silk amino acids increased glycogen content in NAFLD rats. Increased glycogen content may indicate decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis, favored by enhanced intrahepatic TG content. The reduction of TG content seems to explain the way that berries modulate glucose metabolism. The studies of Park et al9,36showed that both blackberry and mulberry extracts decreased serum glucose and insulin levels, as well as AUC of serum glucose levels during either glucose and insulin tolerance testing. Similarly,M. nigraL. andM. albaextracts,30,31,35Phyllanthus niruri,1andVitis viniferaL.48decreased AUC after oral glucose tolerance testing, HOMA-IR, HOMA-IS, and glucose and insulin levels.

NAFLD is a pro-inflammatory condition, and inflammation and oxidative stress are critical for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis development and progression. Actually, inflammation and its main consequence, fibrosis, are key determinants of the long-term prognosis of the disease.57Therefore, a great variety of articles focused on the factors of the second hit hypothesis, such as effects on inflammatory markers and antioxidant enzymes. The inflammatory process was attenuated by berry extracts by decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration9,36,39,41,49and gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers such asTNFa,9,34,36,41–43,45,50,52Il1b,9,34,36,42,43,50,52Il6,34,38,41,42,50Il10,45Nfkb,4,23,34,41,43,45Ppara,38,43Ptgs2(COX-2),34,41,43Ccl2,18,43Ccl3,43Ccr2,43Tgfb,42,45Nlrp3,43,45Nlrp6,45Casp1,43,45Nr1h3(Lxra),32,40,44Icam1,42Itgax(CD11c),42Fabp4,5,32,34F4/80,42Pycard(ASC),45andTlr4.43In the same way, inflammatory markers such as TNF-α,6,30,36,47,52IL-1β,30,52IL-4,30and IL-647,52were decreased in serum. Even short periods of berry extracts (eg, 3-week administration ofPhyllanthus niruri47andLycium barbarumLynn45) or 1-week administration ofRubus aleaefoliusPoir. extract41resulted in a significant improvement in the anti-inflammatory status. Moreover, berry extracts enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the liver by increasing the activity of key role antioxidant enzymes (namely, SOD,3,6,9,30,36,37,42,46,48,51,52CAT,3,42,44,45,48,52GPX,3,36,45,46,48,51,52GRd,44UCP2,32and GSH9,36,51) and decreasing pro-oxidant markers (ie, Nrf2, malondialdehyde [MDA],2,3,9,36–38,42,45,46,48carbonyl protein,2,3,46,48TBARs,6,494-HNE,32,378-isoprostane,46and ROS30). In general, it has been observed that berries with the same extraction protocol and treatment period (aqueous extract; 4 weeks) but of different genera (L. chinense42andP. emblicaL.52) had similar effects on the decrease of TBARS52and GSH and MDA levels.42Such beneficial actions could be explained by the presence of different compounds, such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, catechin, epicatechin, proanthocyanidins, gallic acid, and ellagic acid, which are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.3,37,42,44,52In addition, berry extracts cause decrease of the secretion of various adipokines that contribute to hepatic inflammation.32The most representative effects of berry extracts against NAFLD and its associated alterations are summarized inFigure 2.

One of the principal limitations of this study is the difficulty in defining the term “berry” and the lack of a global Medical Subject Heading term for it. Therefore, this study included the most cultivated and commercialized berry genera. Another limitation was the difficulty of including clinical studies, due to the small number of studies that tested berry extracts in humans (n= 5). This corroborates the fundamental aspect of collecting the already existing results from animal studies for the encouragement of future clinical trials. Moreover, only 3 articles included female rodent models, which indicates lack of information for proving any sex inferences on the observed effects. The high variability of the treatment periods of the studies limits the value of the comparison of the observed effects of berry extracts. Therefore, there is a need for homogenization of the methodology. Also, the heterogeneity of extraction methodologies and solvents, as well as NAFLD induction protocols are a limitation to comparing the beneficial effects of the berry extracts. In addition, the chemical composition of the extracts is difficult to compare and unreliable because there is no established protocol for analysis of compounds, and each study used the standards and analyses the compounds the researchers deemed convenient.

In conclusion, all the studies in this systematic review reported beneficial effects of functional extracts of berries on altered biomarkers associated with NAFLD, although a wide discrepancy in the elaboration of the extracts was observed. Administration of berry extracts to genetically or diet-induced obese animal models demonstrates positive effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, ameliorating first-hit parameters such as body, liver, and fat weight. Additionally, they exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, counteracting the alterations involved in the 2-hit hypothesis. These results are encouraging for the inclusion of berry extracts in clinical trials as a complementary approach for the amelioration of certain disrupted biomarkers linked to NAFLD onset.

This systematic review primarily focuses on in vivo preclinical models that replicate some of the NAFLD-derived alterations to delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations and how they are influenced by the administration of the mentioned functional ingredients. Although these insights are promising, future research involving humans is necessary to fully understand the potential therapeutic benefits of berry extracts. Thus, these findings provide valuable groundwork for designing future clinical studies.
