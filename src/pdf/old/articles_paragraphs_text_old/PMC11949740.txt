Rare‐allele variants are important for crop improvement because they can be linked to important traits. However, genome‐wide distribution and annotation of rare‐allele variants have not been reported. We analyzed sequencing data from 1556 soybean accessions and found 6,533,419 rare‐allele variants inGlycine maxand 941,274 inGlycine sojapopulations. Although the total number of variants was 20% less inG. maxthanG. soja, the number of rare‐allele variants inG. maxwas six times that inG. soja. Among the rare‐allele variants inG. max, 19.16% were novel mutations that did not exist inG. soja. Domestication and artificial selection have not only reduced overall genetic diversity but also the frequency of variants of cultivated soybean. Rare‐allele variants were mainly located in intergenic and noncoding regions rather than coding regions, and in heterochromatin regions rather than euchromatic regions. There were 121,450 rare‐allele variations in 36,213G. maxgenes and 20,645 in 12,332G. sojagenes, resulting in nonsynonymous, stop gain or stop loss mutations. This study provided the first comprehensive understanding of rare‐allele variants in wild and cultivated soybean genomes and its potential impact on gene functions. This information will be valuable for future studies aimed at improving soybean varieties, as these variants may help reveal the underlying mechanisms controlling traits and have the potential to improve stress resistance, yield, and adaptability to environments.

Genetic variants including rare‐allele variants were identified and annotated based on sequence of 1556 accessions.

Rare‐allele variants clustered in noncoding regions and euchromatic regions and resulted in nonsynonymous or stop gain/stop loss mutations in 40%–60% of genes.

Domestication greatly reduced the number of variants and allele frequencies in cultivated compared to wild soybean.

Resources are provided for future biological insights and research to understand how rare‐allele loci affect complex traits.

Genetic variants can be classified into three types based on their minor allele frequency (MAF): common genetic variants with MAF > 5%, low‐frequency variants with MAF between 1% and 5%, and rare‐allele variants with MAF < 1% (Nicolae,2016). Rare‐allele phenomenon was common in plant, animal, and human genomes (Schilthuizen et al.,2001). The 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,2012) reported the biological characteristics of low‐frequency variants in human populations: On average, 26.87% of gene bins, 35.47% of intergenic bins, 42.85% of pathway bins, 14.86% of ORegAnno regulatory bins, and 5.97% of evolutionarily conserved regions showed statistically significant differences in low‐frequency variant burden across populations. Conserved or functionally relevant regions had fewer significant differences in low‐frequency burden than regions under less evolutionary constraint (Moore et al.,2013). Factors such as rapid population growth and weak purifying selection had lowed ancestral populations to accumulate excessive low‐frequency variants in the genome (Moore et al.,2013).

Rare‐allele variants were likely essential for understanding the etiology of common complex traits and uncovering the mechanisms underlying these traits. Genome‐wide association studies in humans showed that adult height was associated with approximately 700 common variants that together explained approximately 20% of the height heritability (Wood et al.,2014); however, the average effect of 32 rare‐allele variants and 51 low‐frequency (1% < MAF ≤ 5%) variants was 10 times greater than that of common variants (Marouli et al.,2017). Rare‐allele variants might also play a role in complex human disease risk (Keinan & Clark,2012), for example, low‐frequency missense and rare‐allele nonsense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lipoprotein gene (Chasman et al.,2009; Mehta,2011) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease gene (Cohen et al.,2006,2005) had large effects on low density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary artery disease risk, respectively. Protein‐truncating variants in GPR75 were found in ∼4/10,000 sequenced people and were associated with a 1.8 kg/m2reduction in body mass index, a 5.3 kg weight loss, and a 54% reduction in the odds of obesity in heterozygous carriers (Akbari et al.,2021). Rare‐allele variants often caused monogenic disorders in humans (Hirschhorn & Daly,2005). Analysis of the whole‐genome sequences from avian IAV H7N9 patients and healthy controls identified a strong association between H7N9 infection and a rare heterozygous single‐nucleotide variant in theMX1gene (Chen et al.,2021).

In plants, although the genome‐wide distribution of rare‐allele variants has not yet been reported, there had been some reports on the functions of rare‐allele variants. TheOsTCP19allele associated with high tillering response to nitrogen was reported to be common in wild rice but was largely lost in modern cultivars (Liu et al.,2021). TheYrAS2388Rallele associated with wheat stripe rust resistance was present inAegilops tauschiiCoss., the donor of the common wheat D genome andA.tauschii–derived synthetic wheat but was absent in 461 common wheat lines tested (C. Zhang et al.,2019). Rare alleles were also shown to be associated with dysregulated expression and correlated with seed‐weight fitness (Kremling et al.,2018). Looking back at the history of plant breeding, the process of plant improvement had also led to some low‐frequency variants with advantages becoming common variants in improved varieties.

Soybean (Glycine max) is an important source of protein meal and vegetable oil used for human consumption and animal feed as well as industrial uses such as biofuel (Hartman et al.,2011). Moreover, soybean plays an important role in the production of other crops as it adds nitrogen to the soil during crop rotation (Singh,2010). In the past decade, many soybean accessions were sequenced (Schmutz et al.,2010), the availability of sequence provided an opportunity to explore rare‐allele variants in soybean on a genome‐wide scale. Q. Song et al. (2015) genotyped 18,480 domesticated soybeans and 1168 wild soybean (Glycine soja) accessions with the SoySNP50K BeadChip assay containing more than 50,000 SNPs. The dataset was used to select a diverse core set of soybean accessions for breeding applications, of which approximately 400 cultivated soybean and 50 wild soybean accessions were re‐sequenced (Valliyodan et al.,2021), and resequencing of additional soybean genomes was also reported by others (Bayer et al.,2022; Chung et al.,2014; Fang et al.,2017; Han et al.,2016; Kajiya‐Kanegae et al.,2021; M. Y. Kim et al.,2010; Li et al.,2014; Liu et al.,2020; Maldonado dos Santos et al.,2016; Qi et al.,2021,2014; Qiu et al.,2014; Shen et al.,2019,2018; Shimomura et al.,2015; Torkamaneh et al.,2018; Valliyodan et al.,2019,2016; Xie et al.,2019; Zhou et al.,2015). H. Zhang et al. (2022) consolidated and analyzed the 1556 soybean genomes of wild, landraces, and elite soybean cultivars available in the public domains and generated at USDA‐ARS, Beltsville, MD. Based on this study, we further functionally annotated all variants in the soybean genome (including the rare‐allele variants) according to the gene models, investigated landscape of rare‐allele variants in soybean genome, and compared the rare‐allele frequencies betweenG. maxandG. sojapopulations.

Genetic variants including rare‐allele variants were identified and annotated based on sequence of 1556 accessions.

Rare‐allele variants clustered in noncoding regions and euchromatic regions and resulted in nonsynonymous or stop gain/stop loss mutations in 40%–60% of genes.

Domestication greatly reduced the number of variants and allele frequencies in cultivated compared to wild soybean.

A total of 1556 soybean whole genome sequences generated at Soybean Genomic Improvement Laboratory, USDA‐ARS, Beltsville, MD, and deposited at SRA NCBI were analyzed and approximately 30 million SNPs were identified (H. Zhang et al.,2022). The accession types, maturity groups, countries of origin, longitude and latitude of the 1556 accessions were previously reported by H. Zhang et al. (2022). These accessions came from 38 countries and their maturity groups ranged from 0 to X. We converted the SNP VCF files to SNP allele files using an in‐house script, and the script also filtered all the SNPs with only one allele and with only heterozygotes. We further eliminated the SNPs with tri‐alleles and with missing and heterozygotes greater than 30%. To reduce false SNP calling, SNPs with the number of accessions containing minor alleles less than or equal to 2 across 1556 cultivated and wild soybeans were eliminated. SNPs with MAF lower than 1% were defined as rare‐allele variants (Auer & Guillaume,2015; Y. J. Kim et al.,2022; Sazonovs & Barrett,2018; Q. Wang et al.,2021). Although different thresholds such as 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% were used in different publications, we adopted the commonly used threshold of 1%. Although number of rare‐allele variants may vary depending on the sample size, a large sample size and a diverse set of germplasm used in this report may minimize the impact.

The sequence annotation was performed using Annovar. Reference genome sequence and annotation files from assembly Wm82a2v1 (Gmax_275_v2.0) were used. The reference genome sequence was downloaded fromhttps://data.jgi.doe.gov/refine‐download/phytozome?q=glycine&expanded=Phytozome‐275(Schmutz et al.,2010) and was converted to Gm_refGeneMrna.fa. The input variant file included the following columns: variant chromosome IDs, variant start and end physical positions, reference genome variant alleles, and alternate variant alleles based on the sequence alignment to Wm82a2v1 assembly.

To screen for insect‐resistant genes, we included only those genes that encoded proteins with relatively clear mechanisms of action on insects. Thus, we selected protease inhibitors that inhibited insect digestive proteases (Nunes et al.,2020); plant lectins that were toxic to various insects such as Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera, and Thysanoptera (Lagarda‐Diaz et al.,2017); amylase inhibitors that inhibited insect amylase (B. Wang et al.,2023); chitinases that were involved in plant defense (Vaghela et al.,2022); and NBS‐LRR proteins that played a key role in plant defense against biotic stresses (Pirithiraj et al.,2023).

A total of 13,651,475 and 16,505,265 variants were identified inG. maxandG. sojapopulations, respectively. Of the 13,651,475 variants in theG. max, 6,533,419 were rare‐allele variants. Of the 16,505,265 variants in theG. sojapopulation, 941,274 were rare‐allele variants. All the rare‐allele variants were positioned in different genic regions: downstream, exonic, exonic‐splicing, intergenic, intronic, upstream, 3′ UTR, and 5′ UTR, and the type of mutations was also annotated and listed in TablesS1andS2. The dataset containing annotations of all variants with rare alleles, low‐frequency alleles, and common alleles has been deposited at the Soybase site (https://data.soybase.org/Glycine/max/diversity/Wm82.gnm2.div.Liu_Shi_2025/)for public access.

In theG. maxpopulation, the average number of rare‐allele variants per chromosome was 326,671 and ranged from 250,081 (Chr11) to 427,813 (Chr18). Rare‐allele variant density ranged from 5467 (Chr13) to 8466 (Chr05) per 1 Mb, with an average of 6913. In theG. sojapopulation, the average number of rare‐allele variants per chromosome was 47,064, ranging from 24,496 (Chr11) to 72,171 (Chr18). The density of rare‐allele variants per 1 Mb window ranged from 636 (Chr05) to 1477 (Chr03), with an average of 989 (Figure1; TableS3). Although the total number of variants was 20% higher inG. sojathanG. max(16,505,265 inG. sojavs. 13,651,475 inG. max), the number of rare‐allele variants inG. sojawas only 14% of the number inG. max. Rare‐allele variants accounted for 5.7% of all SNPs in theG. sojapopulation and 47.9% in theG. maxpopulation. These findings highlighted the abundance of rare‐allele variants in soybean and the significant differences in the prevalence of rare‐allele variants betweenG. maxandG. sojapopulations. The rare‐allele variants in the heterochromatic region of theG. maxandG. sojapopulation accounted for 53.33% and 58.61% of all rare‐allele variants, respectively, which were slightly higher than the proportion of the heterochromatic region in the genome (52.82%) (Table1).

InG. maxpopulation, the 13,651,475 variants were placed in different genomic regions (Figure2; TableS4). The numbers and proportions of variants in different regions were as follows: downstream 662,977 (4.8%), exons 431,588 (3.1%), intergenic regions 10,191,710 (74.6%), introns 1,237,638 (9.0%), upstream 794,429 (5.8%), 3′ UTR 162,241 (1.1%), and 5′ UTR 107,293 (0.7%). In theG. sojapopulation, the 16,505,265 variants were also annotated (Figure2; TableS4): downstream 818,860 (4.9%), exons 531,478 (3.2%), intergenic regions 12,205,077 (73.9%), introns 1,549,851 (9.3%), upstream 978,973 (5.9%), 3′ UTR 206,678 (1.2%), and 5′ UTR 135,247 (0.8%).

For rare‐allele variants, a total of 4,988,045 (76.35%) and 1,545,374 (23.65%) variants from theG. maxpopulation were in intergenic regions and genes, respectively. Of all the intragenic variants, 376,026 (24.33%), 48,007 (3.10%), 199,302 (12.89%), 556,666 (36.02%), 71,871 (4.65%), and 293,502 (18.99%) were in upstream, 5′ UTR, exon, intron, 3′ UTR, and downstream regions of genes, respectively. InG. sojapopulation, a total of 726,925 (77.23%) and 214,349 (22.77%) rare‐allele variants were in intergenic regions and genes, respectively. Among the variants within genes, 46,053 (21.49%), 7,197 (3.36%), 32,616 (15.21%), 79,818 (37.24%), 10,472 (4.89%), and 38,193 (17.82%) were in upstream, 5′ UTR, exon, intron, 3′ UTR, and downstream regions of genes, respectively (Figure2).

In theG. maxpopulation, a total of 7,118,056 non‐rare allele variants were identified, of which 136,526 (1.92%) caused missense mutations, stop gain mutations, or stop loss mutations, and 121,450 (1.86%) of the 6,533,419 rare‐allele variants caused such mutations in 36,213 genes. In theG. sojapopulation, a total of 16,505,265 variants were identified, of which 292,301 (1.88%) caused missense mutations and stop gain/stop loss mutations. A total of 20,645 (2.19%) of the 941,274 rare‐allele variants caused such mutations in 12,332 genes (TablesS1, S2, andS4).

Among the 6,533,419 rare‐allele variants identified inG. max, 5,281,690 were shared between theG. maxandG. sojapopulations. MAF analysis of the shared variants in theG. sojapopulation showed that 608,392 variants were also with rare alleles, accounting for 11.25%; 2,030,674 variants were low‐frequency, accounting for 38.45%; and 2,642,624 variants were common, accounting for 50.03% in theG. soja(Figure3). These results indicated that most of the rare‐allele variants in theG. maxpopulation were due to the decreased MAF of low‐frequency and common variants in theG. sojapopulation (71.53%), and 19.16% of the rare‐allele variants were due to new mutations arising in theG. maxpopulation.

(b) MAF of 898,229G. sojarare‐allele variants inG. maxpopulation. Light blue represents common variants, orange represents low‐frequency variants, and light green represents rare‐allele variants.

For the 941,274 rare‐allele variants identified in theG. sojapopulation, 898,229 variants were shared in both theG. maxandG. sojapopulations. Analysis of these shared variants in theG. maxpopulation showed that 608,392 (67.7%) variants were rare, 159,077 (17.7%) were low‐frequency, and 130,760 (14.5%) were common in theG. maxpopulation (Figure3). Most (64.63%) rare‐allele variants from theG. sojapopulation remained in theG. maxpopulation, and the remaining rare‐allele variants (30.97%) were converted into low‐frequency or common variants.

Base substitution analysis of all variants and rare‐allele variants inG. maxandG. sojapopulations revealed the presence of 12 mutations. The proportions of different forms of base substitutions did not differ much betweenG. maxandG. sojapopulations and between all variants and rare‐allele variants. Among the 12 base substitutions, C‐T and G‐A were the two most common substitution types, accounting for 21.03% and 24.85% of all substitutions, respectively, whereas C‐G and G‐C were the least common substitution types, accounting for 2.28% and 2.40% of all substitutions, respectively. These base substitutions can be divided into transitions and transversions, with transitions accounting for 67% of all substitutions and transversions accounting for 33% in both populations, all variants and rare‐allele variants categories (Figure4).

In the soybean genome annotation file, we searched for genes annotated as proteinase inhibition, phytolection, amylase inhibition, chitinase, and NBS‐LRR, and obtained 45, 255, 71, 44, and 258 genes, respectively, for a total of 673 genes (TableS5). There were 62,260 variants within the intragenic regions of these insect‐resistant genes ofG. soja, of which 10,418 variants resulted in amino acid changes. Among the 62,260 variants, 4065 were rare‐allele variants and were distributed in 580 insect‐resistant genes, 863 of the 4065 rare‐allele variants led to amino acid changes in 273 of these genes. There were 58,217 variants located in the intragenic regions of these genes ofG. max, of which 11,070 variants led to amino acid changes. Among the 58,217 variants, 25,229 were rare‐allele variants, of which 4841 caused amino acid changes. There were 25,229 rare‐allele variants in 600 insect‐resistant genes, of which 539 genes contained at least one rare‐allele variant that caused amino acid changes. We compared the numbers of all variants, rare‐allele variants, and variants causing amino acid changes in the intragenic regions in bothG. sojaandG. maxpopulations, across the genome and in the insect‐resistant genes. The results indicated that across the entire genome, the number of intragenic variants causing amino acid changes was 7/100, and the number of intragenic rare‐allele variants causing amino acid changes was 1/10 inG. sojaand 8/100 inG. max. However, within insect‐resistant genes, these values were approximately 2.4 times those observed genome‐wide (Figure5). The enrichment of amino‐alternation mutations in rare‐allele variants in biotic stress resistance genes may be a result of soybean's response to frequent changes in insect species and insect population sizes during its long domestication history.

The gray bars represent intragenic variants in theG. maxandG. sojapopulations, orange bars represent intragenic variants causing amino acid alteration, green bars represent intragenic rare‐allele variants, and pink bars represent intragenic rare‐allele variants causing amino acid alteration.

By observing the chromosomal distribution of rare‐allele variants and all variants (including common, low‐frequency, and rare‐allele variants) identified inG. maxandG. sojapopulations (Figure1), we found that inG. maxandG. sojapopulations, the number of all variants and rare‐allele variants located in heterochromatin regions was higher than that of variants located in euchromatin regions (Table1; Figure1), and the number of rare‐allele variants in noncoding regions was higher than that of variants in coding regions. The higher proportion of rare‐allele variants in heterochromatic regions might be caused by a combination of factors such as reduced selective pressure, high mutation rate, low recombinant rate, and genetic drift. Heterochromatic regions often contained repetitive sequences, satellite DNA, and fewer protein‐coding genes. These regions typically experienced less selective pressure compared to euchromatic regions, where functional genes were more prevalent. This reduced selective pressure allowed for a higher accumulation of genetic variants, including those with rare alleles. Studies have shown that some heterochromatin regions had higher mutation rates than euchromatin regions. This higher mutation rate might lead to an increase in the number of genetic variations and rare alleles in these regions. Heterochromatic regions also had lower rates of recombination that played a key role in mixing genetic material and could reduce the frequency of minor alleles in euchromatic regions through mechanisms such as genetic drift and selection. In heterochromatic regions with lower recombination, minor alleles might persist at higher frequencies over evolutionary timescales. Noncoding regions generally had a higher proportion of variants with rare alleles compared to coding regions for several reasons: Exons coded for proteins, and any variations in these regions could have a direct impact on protein function. Therefore, deleterious mutations in coding regions were often removed by purifying selection, leading to a lower frequency of variants. In contrast, variants in noncoding regions were more likely to be neutral; neutral variants were not subject to strong selective pressures and could drift in the population, leading to a higher proportion of rare alleles.

InG. maxpopulation, dense clusters of rare‐allele variants observed on Chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 18, and 20, some of these densely clustered hotspots (e.g., regions on Chromosomes 5 and 20) did not have a large number of total variants. Although the reasons for the formation of most, if not all, rare‐allele variant clusters were unclear, the cluster formation of a few rare‐allele variants could be inferred from the annotated gene functions inArabidopsis thaliana, for example, the rare‐allele variant G/A at Chr05_7237778 on Chromosome 5, whose genotype “AA” was 0.60% in cultivated soybean but 55.50% in wild soybean, dropped sharply during domestication and improvement (FigureS1). This might be attributed to the functionality of the gene (SMO1) containing the variant. InArabidopsis, double mutations within this gene could cause embryonic lethality (J. Song et al.,2019). In cultivated soybean, some new double mutations within this gene might also cause embryonic lethality and led to low survival of specific genotypes, and the clustering of rare‐allele variants might be expanded due to the extent of linkage disequilibrium in this genomic region containing theSMO1gene.

Our results showed that domestication and artificial selection had reduced the MAF of most non‐rare variants fromG. sojapopulation. The number of variants in cultivated soybean was 20% lower than in wild soybean, and the number of rare‐allele variants in cultivated soybean was six times higher than in wild soybean.

This suggested that domestication and selection had greatly reduced the genetic diversity of the cultivated soybean by reducing the total number of variants and decreasing variant allele frequency. The reduction of genetic diversity might have led to an increased vulnerability of soybean to biotic and abiotic stresses. These findings were consistent with the view that a genetic diversity bottleneck occurred during soybean domestication and improvement, and that wild soybean retained allelic diversity appeared to have been lost in cultivated soybean (Hyten et al.,2006; Lam et al.,2010). Domestication and selection can also increase the proportion of rare‐allele variants in cultivated soybean compared to wild soybean due to several evolutionary and genetic mechanisms. In the wild, natural selection removes deleterious alleles that reduce survival or reproduction. Under domestication, human care (e.g., irrigation, fertilizers, and pest control) reduces natural selective pressures. As a result, some rare deleterious mutations that would have been eliminated in the wild can persist or even increase in frequency. Occasionally, cultivated soybeans may hybridize with wild relatives or other cultivated lines, introducing new rare alleles. If these alleles are not immediately selected against, they may persist. Neutral mutations may also play an important role for the presence of rare‐allele variants in cultivated soybean.

Genome‐wide functional annotation of genetic variation, especially rare‐allele variants, can play a key role in unraveling the mysteries of plant genomes. These rare‐allele variants were often overlooked due to their low frequency, but they can carry key adaptive traits such as enhanced stress tolerance or improved yield. Information of the identified variants that alter protein amino acids, function, or even completely stop protein production throughout the soybean genome will help to determine their functions, understand how they affect complex traits, and aid in soybean improvement.
