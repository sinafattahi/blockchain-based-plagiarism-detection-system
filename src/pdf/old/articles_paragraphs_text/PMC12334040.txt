In the capital-constrained newsvendor paradigm, revenue share financing (RSF) presents a novel yet underexplored financing approach. This theoretical study conducts a comparative analysis of two financing methods: traditional debt financing and revenue share financing. Our research findings indicate that the revenue share ratio, cost share ratio, and debt interest rate are the most critical factors influencing retailers’ decisions. This study further demonstrates that, under certain conditions, both financing strategies can yield competitive profit margins and order quantity. Additionally, we discovered that fund providers have a minimum revenue share ratio, whereas for retailers, there is a maximum revenue share ratio. These two ratios establish a bargaining interval within which an optimal revenue share ratio can be achieved if it falls within this range. Outside this range, RSF is either unattainable or impractical.

Access to financing for small and micro enterprises has always been a global challenge. Due to the unstable asset status, low credit ratings, and insufficient collateral, traditional financing methods often prove unfriendly to these enterprises. A World Bank (2024) survey of companies in 144 countries found that 51.4% of the companies required loans, and 21.2% considered financing availability a significant obstacle to their development. This indicates that gaining sufficient financial support during the development process is a crucial issue for these enterprises and that small and medium-sized enterprises have difficulty obtaining loans. According to the fourth economic census data released by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018, micro and small enterprises account for 98.5% of all firms. However, according to the China Financial Yearbook 2019, the balance of loans to micro and small enterprises accounts for only 32.1% of all outstanding loans. The disparity between the proportion of micro and small enterprises and their access to capital market support, such as issuance of bond financing and listing financing, is enormous. Despite relying on informal loans from family and friends and other private lending channels, they still struggle to secure stable funding, underscoring the substantial financing difficulties faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China.

In recent years, many innovative financing products and business models have emerged, and different financing methods have greatly facilitated the growth of SMEs and the market’s prosperity. The development of SMEs finance has also become a new direction for expanding business models in the financial field, attracting significant attention and research from academia and industry alike [1–6].

A new financing practice for SMEs, called revenue share financing (RSF), has recently emerged in mainland China. Unlike traditional financing, which relies on equity and debt financing—equity based on profits and debt on assets—RSF focuses on a company’s revenue and cash flow. This approach aligns with the operating cash flow reported in the company’s cash flow statement. For instance, Micro Connect, a financial company that leverages financial technology to connect global capital with small and micro enterprises in China, is pioneering this innovative financing model. The RSF offered by Micro Connect involves the investor contributing a certain amount of capital to the physical store. Within the agreed-upon timeframe, a predetermined percentage of the store’s revenue is allocated to the investor daily as a return on investment. Once this revenue share period expires, the revenue share concludes, and both parties complete the capital settlement, thus ending the partnership.

Revenue share financing is distinct from both debt and equity financing. It operates through a revenue-aligned repayment structure, where businesses repay investors a fixed percentage of monthly revenue until reaching a predetermined return cap or time deadline, avoiding equity dilution, collateral requirements, and fixed repayment schedules. Distinct from debt financing, Revenue share financing eliminates interest rates and collateral obligations, while differing from equity funding by preserving ownership control and bypassing exit mandates. Its flexibility suits businesses with stable recurring revenue—such as SaaS, subscription models, or high-margin ventures—particularly asset-light or growth-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit but lack profitability. Compared to traditional financing, Revenue share financing accelerates funding timelines and shifts risk-sharing to revenue outcomes rather than fixed obligations. As a new way of financing for SMEs, it has received mixed reviews in society: Revenue Sharing Financing allows businesses to retain ownership without collateral, offers flexible repayments tied to revenue fluctuations, and has faster approval processes than traditional financing. However, it carries higher costs than bank loans, with total fees potentially rising sharply if revenue surges, and agreements often include restrictive clauses. Its applicability is limited to non-sensitive industries with stable revenue, while startups or unprofitable ventures struggle to qualify. Additionally, the industry faces legal and regulatory compliance challenges, requiring vigilance regarding contract terms and evolving oversight risks [7,8]. However, as a novel finance business model, it can quickly develop within the current legal framework, and its underlying operation logic is worth further research.

This paper presents models integrating the two financing alternatives within the operational decisions of a newsvendor-like retailer. The model encompasses a singular capital-constrained retailer and a fund provider. The capital-constrained retailer pursues short-term financing to buy inventory from its upstream manufacturer. The retailer faces uncertain demand and operates as a newsvendor. The funding provider presents two financing options: debt financing and revenue share financing. It derives the corresponding order quantity and profitability for each financing method and subsequently deliberates on the optimal financing strategy for the retailer.

When selecting between revenue share and debt financing, critical factors include the interest rates offered by fund providers, revenue share ratio, and cost share ratio. Retailers are inclined towards RSF when debt interest rates are high. An equilibrium threshold for the revenue share ratio exists, below which retailers favor RSF; above this threshold, they opt for debt financing. A similar equilibrium threshold applies to the cost share ratio. With a fixed financing amount, fund providers have a minimum acceptable revenue share ratio; no funds will be provided below this threshold. Retailers also have a threshold for the revenue share ratio; if it exceeds this threshold, they will choose debt financing. The Nash bargaining model was utilized to optimize and compare the revenue share ratio with the thresholds, highlighting a bounded range for the revenue share ratio.

The structure of this article is as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature and highlights previous research. Section 3 presents a detailed model that analyzes the financing logic for both debt financing and RSF. Section 4 validates these findings through numerical analysis. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions and suggests directions for future research.

This article addresses supply chain contracts and the capital-constrained newsvendor model. Numerous scholars have examined the interaction between operational and financial decisions. Our research focuses on how capital constraints and financial choices influence fund providers and retailers. It draws from three main areas of literature: research on supply chain management contracts, studies of capital-constrained newsvendors and supply chain finance.

Supply chain contracts are a crucial topic in supply chain management. Previous research has extensively explored the mutual effects of different contracts in supply chains and how to optimize supply chain management using various contracts. These contracts encompass wholesale price contracts, revenue share contracts, return contracts, two-part tariff contracts, service-level agreements, quantity flexibility contracts, and so on. Cachon [9] examined six different contracts in the supply chain. He argued that compared to pure wholesale price contracts, each type of contract can induce retailers to increase their order quantities. However, no single contract universally dominates the others in all circumstances. Pasternack [7] studied return contracts in a multi-distributor environment. He found that a policy limiting returns to a fixed percentage of the purchase amount does not necessarily maximize channel profit. Instead, a return policy allowing unlimited returns of a portion of the credit can achieve this goal. Cachon and Lariviere [10] found that revenue share contracts can coordinate supply chains and allocate profits arbitrarily in the case of a single retailer. Furthermore, revenue share contracts can also coordinate supply chains in the presence of quantity competition among retailers. Wang and Pan [11] studied the coordination problem of a c contract in the presence of unreliable supply. The results show that supply chain coordination can be achieved under the quantity flexibility contract when the wholesale price and procurement commitments meet certain conditions. Wong, Qi [12] found that perfect coordination in the supply chain can be achieved when sales rebate contracts are combined with a vendor-managed inventory mechanism. This means that even when considering the retailer’s interests, they can make pricing decisions to maximize the profit of the entire supply chain. In addition, the intensity of competition also affects the profit distribution between suppliers and retailers. When competition is intense, more profit will be allocated to the manufacturer. Nie and Du [13] studied the impact of peer-induced fairness and distribution fairness on the decision-making process in a dual-level supply chain when using quantity discount contracts between suppliers and retailers. They found that quantity discount contracts cannot coordinate the supply chain when participants in the supply chain do not have fair concerns. However, by making simple adjustments to the contracts, it is possible to achieve coordination in the supply chain by ensuring that the total profit of suppliers and retailers is equal to the profit of the coordinating channel. Du, Nie [14] used the Nash game model to study a bilateral supply chain where both suppliers and retailers have concerns about fairness. They analyzed the impact of fairness concerns on optimal decisions and channel efficiency. When fairness concerns are present in the supply chain, its efficiency decreases. When suppliers are less concerned about fairness, retailers’ order quantities will be more significant. Moreover, fairness concerns do not change the state of supply chain coordination. Our research examines the strategic application of revenue share contracts, considering them as tools for supply chain coordination and mechanisms for addressing capital shortages. We analyze how the financial benefits and risks linked to revenue share contracts can impact supply chain decisions in the context of constrained capital. This approach provides a novel perspective on the intersection of finance and supply chain management.

This section focuses on studying the capital-constrained newsvendor problem involving two parties: a capital-constrained retailer and a fund provider. The retailer requires short-term financing to purchase a single product as an inventory, which will be sold to consumers. The primary objective of this section is to explore the interactions among these two parties within the framework of the newsvendor model. We consider two financing methods: debt financing and the RSF.

In the first stage, the wholesale pricewis fixed, and then the retailer determines the purchasing quantityqbased on this price. The initial capital of the retailer isx, and if the purchasing costwqexceedsx, the fund provider can supply the additional funds. This article explores two methods: debt financing and RSF. Under debt financing, the fund provider provides the required funds in exchange for repayment and interest in the second stage. In contrast, with RSF, the fund provider supplies the necessary funds but receives a predetermined percentage of the revenue as financing costs based on actual sales in the second stage. Regardless of the financing method chosen, the retailer makes the initial product purchase in the first stage, and in the second stage, market demand is realized, prompting the retailer to reimburse the fund provider according to the selected financing arrangement.

The retailer’s decision includes the purchasing quantityqand the choice of financing method. The exogenous parameters are the risk-free raterf,debt interest raterD,(whererD≥rf), the unit retail pricep,and wholesale pricew. To simplify the model without losing generality, we exclude the salvage value of unsold items and the associated goodwill loss, as they do not fundamentally alter the problem. To avoid trivial scenarios, we assumep>(1+rD)w>0. The market demand, denoted bydis uncertain. LetF(·)be the cumulative distribution function andf(·)be the probability density function ofd. We assumeF(d)is a strictly increasing and differentiable function,F(0)=0, andE(d)denote the expected demand. These assumptions are aligned with those presented by Kouvelis and Zhao (16) in their study. Furthermore, all participants in this model are considered trustworthy and are expected to adhere to the contractual agreements.Table 1. list all the notations used in this model.

Here, the term reflects the investment income earned at the risk-free interest rate from the retailer’s additional funds, after accounting for the necessary capital for purchasing. The optimal order quantity is given byq1*=F−1(1−w(1+rf)/p). When the retailer’s capital is adequate, the determination of the optimal order quantity is influenced by various factors, including the product’s probability distribution, market price, wholesale cost, and risk-free interest rate. This formulation embodies the critical fractile solution for optimal inventory decisions in the classical newsvendor model.

In this case, the optimal order quantity in this situation isq2*=F−1(1−w(1+rD)/p).

The optimal order quantity in this situation isq2*=F−1(1−w(1+rD)/p).

In this scenario,δrepresent the cost share ratio indicating the percentage of expenses covered by the fund provider. The optimal order quantity isq2*=F−1(1−w(1−δrf+rf+δrD)/p).

After analyzing three distinct financial scenarios, we find that the optimal order quantity remains unchanged when a retailer uses all available funds—regardless of whether they come from initial capital or other sources. However, when the retailer secures a debt while reserving some funds for alternative uses, the optimal order quantity increases relative to scenarios where all funds are exclusively allocated to purchasing.

Whereθ∈[0,1]represents the proportion of total revenue taken by the fund provider under the RSF model. The optimal order quantity in this situation isq3*=F−1(1).This indicates that when all capital is derived solely from the fund provider, the retailer will opt to procure the maximum possible order quantity.

whereδ∈[0,1]represents the proportion of inventory costs borne by the fund provider. The optimal order quantity in this situation isq3*=F−1(1−(1−δ)w/p(1−θ)).

wherex−(1−δ)wqrepresent when the initial capital of the retailer exceeds the inventory cost, the retailer will invest the remaining funds and receive a return equal to the risk-free rate. The optimal order quantity in this situation isq3*=F−1(1−(1−δ−δrf+rf)w/p(1−θ)).

Through the above analysis, we found that in the case where the initial capital of the retailer is 0, the optimal order quantity is equal to the maximum market capacity. In this scenario, the absence of cost input compels the retailer to pursue an aggressive strategy to capture the entire market share to maximize profits. However, this approach may impose more significant costs on the fund provider, potentially leading to capital losses. As a result, under these conditions, the fund provider may be reluctant to extend credit. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the optimal order quantity is greater when the retailer operates without surplus funds as compared to situations where surplus funds are maintained.

To analyze the attractiveness of different financing methods for fund providers, we first consider the expected income generated from investments in the RSF model, represented asE[min(d,q)]θp, and income derived from debt financing asδwqrB. Additionally, the potential loss incurred can be quantified asp∫0d^F(x)dx. For these two financing methods to be perceived as equally attractive to fund providers, their respective revenue must matchπIM=πID. It is important to note that each financing method establishes distinct demand thresholds for fund providers. In RSF, this threshold is defined asd^RSF=(1−δ)wq/θpwhile the threshold in debt financing isd^debt=(wq−x)(1+rD)/p. these two thresholds converge whenθ=1/(1+rD). In this scenario, the income for fund providers in both models are equal:E[min(d,q)]θp=δwqrB. Conversely, ifθ<1/(1+rD), it results inE[min(d,q)]θp>δwqrD, indicating fund provider need to take away more capital from the retailer under RSF. This is because, under the RSF model, fund providers must bear a more significant risk level than debt financing.

In the above, we analyzed retailers’ profit and optimal order quantity under three different scenarios. In this section, we focus on the case in which the retailer’s initial capital and financing funds equals the purchasing cost. To compare two financing models, we assume that the uncertainty of demanddfollows a uniform distributionU[0,u]. The optimal order quantity for the debt financing model is given byq2*=u(1−w(1+rD)/p), while for the RSF model, it is given byq3*=u(1−(1−δ)w/p(1−θ)).

Corollary 1.The difference in optimal order quantity has the following properties:∂ΔQ∂δ<0,∂ΔQ∂θ>0,and∂ΔQ∂rD<0.

According to Corollary 1, the cost share ratio and the interest rate exert a negative impact onΔQ. In contrast, the revenue share ratio has a positive effect onΔQ. Whenδ>θ−(1−θ)rB,ΔQ>0, indicating that the optimal order quantity under the debt financing model exceeds that under the RSF model. Conversely, whenδ<θ−(1−θ)rD,ΔQ<0, meaning that the optimal order quantity under the RSF model exceeds that under the debt financing model, retailers aiming to increase their order quantities should consider these findings.

Proposition 1.For the retailer, there existsδ^. in which the difference in profits between the two financing models is equal to zeroΔπ=0.Whenδ<δ^the retailer will choose the debt model for financing. Conversely, whenδ>δ^the retailer will choose the RSF.

Proposition 1 indicates that the retailer’s financing choice is affected by the cost share ratio. When the cost share ratio is relatively highδ>δ^, the retailer will prefer the RSF to maximize profits. This preference stems from the fact that a higher cost share ratio transfers more market risk from the retailer to the fund provider, thereby reducing the initial capital required from the retailer. When the cost share is relatively lowδ<δ^, the retailer will opt for debt financing, resulting in higher profits.

Proposition 2.For theretailer, there existsθ^which the profit differential between the two financing models is also zeroΔπ=0. Whenθ>θ^, the retailer will choose the debt model financing. Whenθ<θ^, the retailer will choose the RSF.

In debt financing, the cost of funds is fixed at a specific interest rate. In contrast, the cost of funds in RSF varies according to the revenue share ratio. As Proposition 2 indicates, when the revenue share ratio is relatively highθ>θ^, the cost of funds increases, leading the retailer to prefer debt financing. Conversely, when the revenue share ratio is relatively lowθ<θ^, enabling the retailer to attain higher profits by opting for RSF.

Corollary 2 indicates that the revenue and cost share ratios significantly influence the retailer’s profit difference. Specifically, an increase in the revenue share ratio leads the retailer to favor debt financing. In contrast, an increase in the cost share ratio enhances the attractiveness of the RSF option for the retailer.

WhereΦ(·)andϕ(·)denote the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the standard normal distribution, respectively.

When profits are high andq*>μ, the sensitivity ofq*toσis positive:∂q*∂σ>0. When profits are low andq*<μ, the sensitivity ofq*toσis negative:∂q*∂σ<0.

When the retail pricepis significantly higher than the wholesale pricew, retailers tend to increase order quantities to capture upside demand gains∂q*∂σ>0. The high marginal profit makes stockout costs much higher than overstocking risks. The fixed interest rate of debt financing amplifies profit advantages through leverage, encouraging aggressive strategies.

Whenpis close tow, increased demand volatilityσleads retailers to reduce order quantities∂q*∂σ<0. Here, the financial risk of overstocking dominates decisions. Financing cost pressures squeeze profit space, pushing retailers toward conservative strategies to avoid debt repayment crises.

These dynamics reveal a corporate trade-off mechanism: retailers “bet on demand increases” when profits are high and “guard against demand decreases” when profits are low. The interplay of debt costs and volatility shapes optimal inventory strategies. Notably, under revenue-sharing financing, despite different risk-sharing mechanisms, the consistent sensitivity direction indicates that retailers’ responses to demand volatility are universal. This further confirms the model’s robustness.

This indicating higher volatility increases financing costs due to the fixed interest structure amplifying borrowing needs.

This reveals that higher volatility reduces financing costs. This counterintuitive result stems from RSF’s risk-sharing mechanism: the fund provider internalizes demand volatility through revenue and cost-sharing ratios, thereby mitigating the retailer’s financial burden.

Under bank financing, financing costs exhibit a positive sensitivity to market volatility. This arises because heightened demand volatility incentivizes retailers to increase their optimal order quantity, amplifying borrowing needs to finance larger inventory purchases. The fixed interest rate, applied proportionally to the loan amount, translates this expanded borrowing into higher financing costs. In contrast, RSF demonstrates an inverse relationship, with financing costs decreasing as volatility rises.

Two mechanisms drive this counterintuitive result: first, the risk-sharing mechanism inherent in RSF redistributes demand volatility risks between the retailer and fund provider through negotiated revenue and cost shares, effectively internalizing a portion of the uncertainty; second, the revenue compensation effect leverages higher expected sales revenue under volatility to offset proportional repayment obligations. This dynamic highlights RSF’s adaptability to volatile markets, where flexible risk allocation mitigates financial strain, whereas bank financing—with its rigid interest structure—remains better suited to stable demand environments.

We employ the Nash bargaining model to explore the fund provider’s alternatives, assuming that the fund provider and the retailer can negotiate to establish the revenue share ratio within the RSF framework, the objective is to identify a mutually acceptable ratio for both parties.

Proposition 5.The optimal revenue share ratio isθ*=(Q+g−x−πRW)/2Q, At this ratio, both the retailer and the fund provider can achieve a Nash equilibrium that maximizes their respective profits.

In this scenario, the revenue share ratio is fixed atθ―=(B+g)/Q.This ratio,θ―can be considered the fund provider’s minimum acceptable threshold. If the actual revenue share ratio falls belowθ―, the fund provider will refrain from lending to the retailer, as any ratio beneath this threshold would inevitably result in a loss for the fund provider or yield less profit compared to debt financing.

Assuming the retailer has the same expected total revenue and borrowing amount across different financing modes within the same market environment, the profit function of the retailer under debt financing can be represented asπRD=Q−B(1+rD)−x. The profit function of the retailer under the RSF mode can be represented asπRM=Q(1−θ)−x. The difference in profits between the two financing models can be calculated as:Δπ=πRD−πRM=Qθ−B(1+rD).

In this context, there exists a revenue share ratioθ~=B(1+rD)/Q. that equates the profit difference to zero. Ifθ>θ~, the retailer should opt for debt financing; ifθ<θ~, RSF is preferable. Consequently, a bargaining space is defined asθ∈(θ―,θ~). Whenθ―<θ*<θ~, the fund provider and retailer can reach a Nash bargaining optimal revenue share ratio if the bargaining is feasible. In the condition whereθ*>θ~, the optimal ratio is not achievable, and ifθ―>θ~, the RSF option will be unsuitable for both parties.

In conclusion, we identified three potential revenue share ratios:θ―,θ~andθ*. If the fund provider has exclusive authority over determining the revenue share ratio, he will selectθ~. If the ratio is negotiated between the fund provider and the retailer,θ~will be chosen if feasible. Conversely, if the retailer possesses the authority to determine the ratio, he will opt forθ―.

In this section, we conducted a numerical analysis to validate our findings and examined the impact of different parameters under two financing models. The numerical parameters utilized in our study are as follows:p=1,w=0.4,x=1,rD=rf=0.The uncertainty of demanddfollows a uniform distributionU[0,u]andu=10. This part mainly examines whether the above proposition and result are correct.

The analysis of the combined data presented inFig 1. reveals significant relationships between cost share ratioδand revenue share ratioθwithΔπandΔQ. A notable negative correlation exists betweenδ,ΔπandΔQ, suggesting that asδincreases,ΔπandΔQdecrease. Specifically, whenθ=0.4andδ>0.6619,retailers should opt for RSF to maximize profits, whereas debt financing is more advantageous whenδ<0.6619. Additionally, forθ=0.4andδ>0.4, the optimal order quantity under RSF exceeds that of debt financing; conversely, whenδ<0.4, the opposite holds.

Concerningθ, a positive correlation is observed with bothΔπandΔQ. Asθincreases,ΔπandΔQalso increase. For instance, whenδ=0.3andθ>0.175, debt financing is recommended for higher profits, while RSF is advantageous whenθ<0.175. Furthermore, whenδ=0.3andθ>0.3, the optimal order quantity under debt financing surpasses that under RSF, whereas it is greater for RSF whenθ<0.3.

Assuming the same conditions as mentioned earlier, letΔπIrepresent the profit difference for the fund provider. Under the same assumption as above, we choose an order quantity of 3 as the starting point since the retailer must seek financing for orders of this size or larger. Whenq=3, the revenue share ratioθneed to be 0.392 to achieveΔπI=0.Fig 2. illustrates how varying levels ofθimpact the fund provider’s profit difference under different financing amounts, asθincrease, fund provider’s profit under RSF increases.

Fig 3illustrates the impact of changes in the debt interest rate onθ―,θ~andθ*. When the debt interest rate is set to zero,θ―is always larger thanθ~, indicating that RSF is not a viable option for both parties. This is because, with a zero-interest rate, borrowing use debt becomes cost-free, and the retailer will always choose the debt financing. However, whenrD=0.3as shown on the right side ofFig 3. Becauseθ―<θ~, in this scenario there is a bargaining space for the revenue share ratio for both parties. The debt interest rate significantly affects the value ofθ―. Nonetheless, in both scenarios, the optimal revenue share ratio,θ*remains unachievable under any circumstances.

Fig 4Show the case whichθ*can be achieved, withθ*being primarily affected by the initial capitalx. Asxincrease,θ*decrease. If the initial capital is set atx=0.1with all other conditions held constant, the optimal revenue share ratio is betweenθ―andθ~, therefore the optimal condition can be achieved. Whenq=3.51,θ*=θ―=0.465. Ifq<3.51, the optimal revenue share ratio can be attained. Conversely, whenq>3.51, the optimal ratio cannot be achieved. However, RSF remains accessible regardless of the purchase quantity.

This study examines a financially constrained newsvendor model. First, we analyze how a retailer’s financing choice (debt or revenue share) affects profits and optimal order quantity under financial constraints. In the construction of the model, we consider three scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume the retailer has zero initial capital. In the second scenario, retailers have fully exhausted their initial and financing capital for inventory purposes. In the third scenario, retailers retain some of their funds for inventory after financing. Our analysis reveals that the optimal order quantity is the same under debt financing in the first two scenarios. In the third scenario, the optimal order quantity is influenced by factors such as the cost share ratio, debt interest rate, and risk-free interest rate. When retailers opt for RSF, in the first scenario, the retailer will try to capture all market capacity since there are no associated costs. In the second scenario, the optimal order quantity is affected by the revenue share and cost share ratio. In the third scenario, the debt interest rate and risk-free rate also influence the optimal order quantity.

We then compared the impact of two financing models on retailers’ decisions, focusing on revenue and cost share ratios under the assumption that the market is uniformly distributed. An equilibrium pointθ^exists for the revenue share ratio. Whenθ<θ^the retailer will choose RSF. Conversely, the retailer will choose debt financing. Similarly, an equilibrium pointδ^exists for the cost share ratio; whenδ>δ^, the retailer will choose RSF, and whenδ<δ^, the retailer will choose debt financing.

We employed the Nash bargaining model to identify the optimal revenue share ratio. Through Nash bargaining, we identify a bounded interval forθwhere mutually beneficial agreements between retailers and fund providers are achievable. Outside this range, RSF becomes impractical, emphasizing the importance of aligning contractual terms with market conditions and risk appetites. Then we analyze how demand volatility affects the financing market. Under debt financing, rising demand volatility amplifies financing costs due to rigid interest obligations. In contrast, RSF mitigates this effect through proportional risk-sharing, making it more adaptable to uncertain markets.

Examining revenue share as a financing mechanism presents considerable potential for further investigation. This study simplifies the model by analyzing a scenario with a single fund provider and a single retailer. Future research could explore how competition affects retailers’ financing decisions with multiple parties. Moreover, the revenue share model raises several compelling issues for inquiry, including potential moral hazards, adverse selection challenges faced by retailers, and risk management difficulties encountered by fund providers.

We derived the optimal order quantity by differentiating the profit function under debt financing, setting the derivative to zero, solving for the critical cumulative demand value, and applying the inverse cumulative distribution function.

We employed a method analogous to that used for Proposition 1 to determine the optimal order quantity under the revenue-sharing model.

The sign of∂q*∂σis determined by the relationship betweenq*andμ.
