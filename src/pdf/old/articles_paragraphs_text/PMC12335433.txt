Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease increasingly linked to neuroinflammation, and a heightened response of nociceptive neurons called central sensitisation, leading to persistent pain and functional decline. Neuroinflammation, along with dysfunction in serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways, and chronic activation of the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, prolongs the pain sensations. Conventional treatments, including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, primarily offer symptomatic relief but fail to address these central mechanisms while posing risks of adverse effects.

This narrative review explores alternative approaches, specifically Ayurveda and yoga-based interventions, as potential strategies to mitigate neuroinflammation and pain hypersensitivity in OA.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across databases of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar from the year 2005 to 2025 using multiple keywords related to OA, central sensitisation, yoga, and Ayurveda. Published studies were reviewed for outcomes related to central sensitisation and OA.

Ayurvedic herbs consistently have been shown to have positive results in modulating inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress without adverse effects. Yoga has been shown to regulate the HPA axis, enhance vagal tone, and promote neuroplasticity, all of which contribute to pain modulation. Furthermore, mindfulness and meditation practices stimulate the release of endogenous opioids, thereby reinforcing descending pain inhibitory pathways. Both interventions contribute to OA management by supporting weight control, improving metabolic function, enhancing executive-level modulation of pain perception, and promoting better sleep quality. Their active analgesic effects, combined with a holistic mind-body approach, offer a safe and sustainable strategy for long-term OA management.

Yoga and Ayurveda have shown reliable results in providing safe and effective management of chronic OA accompanied by central sensitisation. However, there is a need for large-scale studies to integrate these into the mainstream treatment regimens.

The modern medical treatment transiently relieves symptoms, but in the long run, can cause havoc to health.9Oral and topical use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) can temporarily alleviate pain and improve function in hand, knee and hip OA.10With oral preparations, the lowest effective dose and shortest duration of treatment are recommended due to the wide range of potential side effects.10Consequently, there is a lack of safe and effective long-term treatment options available for OA. This underscores the need for more effective and sustained therapies that target not only pain but also central sensitisation in OA management.

This review explores how two indigenous therapeutic approaches from the Indian Knowledge System (IKS): Yoga and Ayurveda, cater to the burden of OA by targeting on their potential to modulate associated neuroinflammation and central sensitisation. Furthermore, it examines how a biopsychosocial framework that integrates Ayurveda and yoga-based interventions can offer a comprehensive, safe and effective strategy to modulate neuroinflammation, central sensitisation, and pain processing in OA. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, covering studies published between 2005 and 2025. This narrative review appraises a range of outcomes associated with yoga and Ayurveda interventions, including physiological, psychological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular changes relevant to OA pathophysiology, and presents novel study findings while emphasising the necessity for further high-quality research. It also delineates key actions required to advance clinical translation and integration of these approaches.

Yoga tends to reduce the inflammation, potentially by its positive effect on metabolism and cellular health. With advancing age, there is derangement in the immune system leading to higher levels of vascular inflammation markers such as fibrinogen, hs-CRP, and ESR. A 10-weekHathayoga intervention in elderly women was found to significantly reduce these inflammatory markers.27Additionally, elevated biological stress mediated through the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, immune system response and autonomic nervous system is correlated.28Yoga is known to reduce stress, which partly explains its positive effect in lowering inflammation and improving vagal tone.29In addition to that, yoga intervention helps in reducing circulatory cortisol, IL-6, IL-1ß, CRP, TNF-α, INF-γ, CD56 and IgA.28A non-randomised yoga-based lifestyle intervention study reported a reduction in stress and inflammation markers within 10 days in patients with chronic diseases. A significant reduction in plasma cortisol, β-endorphin, IL-6 and TNF-α was reported.30An RCT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17A, and TNF-α) and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine (TGF-β) with an 8-week yoga-based lifestyle intervention.31In a placebo-controlled RCT on COVID-19 positive patients, 7 days of Ayurvedic treatment resulted in significantly lower serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α.32The Ayurveda group achieved 100% recovery within a week compared to 60% recovery in the placebo group.

Emerging evidence suggests that reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels may significantly influence the pathophysiology of OA pain. Reckziegel et al. demonstrated an inverse correlation between GABA concentrations in the mid-anterior cingulate cortex and the intensity of pain in chronic knee OA patients, indicating that reduced GABA levels may contribute to heightened experience of chronic pain.47Similarly, a systematic review highlighted the efficacy of GABA derivatives, such as pregabalin and gabapentin, in alleviating OA pain, further underscoring the role of GABAergic mechanisms in pain modulation.52These findings collectively suggest that reduced GABA levels may exacerbate OA pain by impairing inhibitory control within central nociceptive pathways, leading to increased neuronal excitability and pain sensitisation. An RCT compared yoga with an active control arm has shown an increase in GABA levels immediately and even after 3 months of intervention. There was better improvement in mood and anxiety, which was correlated with improved GABA levels.53Oral intake of GABA is known to improve sleep and reduce stress.54Withania somnifera(Ashwagandha) is a common ayurvedic pain, stress and sleep management medicine. Withanolides and triethylene glycol were the two active compounds found in ashwagandha root and leaves.55One RCT reported reduced cortisol and stress in subjects with psychological stress, with an intervention of oral Ashwagandha extract with 300 mg twice a day for 2 months. Possibly by positive impact on the HPA axis, implicated in the regulation of glutamate, GABA and cortisol hormone; yoga and Ayurveda tend to improve the central sensitisation.

Impaired descending inhibitory pathways significantly contribute to central sensitisation, particularly in OA, affecting pain perception and responses. These pathways operate in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and influence pain response through complex interactions with various neurotransmitters.56Glutamate’s impact on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is a significant modulator of central sensitisation, resulting in increased intracellular levels of calcium and subsequent kinase activation, amplifying pain signals. In a healthy system, descending pathways including serotonin-norepinephrine and opioidergic processes help to diminish pain sensitivity and to sustain the analgesia. However, in chronic pain syndromes like OA, there is typically a significant loss of descending analgesia, which can result in heightened pain experiences that include hyperalgesia and allodynia and sympathetically maintained pain.57Notably, central sensitisation not only alters pain processing but also signifies a shift in central pain mechanisms, making it essential to understand these impairments for therapeutic applications.

Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is a centrally controlled measure of the overall impact of the descending pain pathway. This includes both the facilitative and inhibitive effects.58CPM has been described under several terms, including diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation (HNCS), and endogenous analgesia (EA). The restoration of CPM has been documented in patients following joint replacement surgery, indicating that improved descending inhibition can relieve widespread mechanical hyperalgesia.59Given the intricacies of central pain processing, tailored treatments that boost descending analgesic pathways may give more effective pain relief for people with OA than standard pain drugs that focus primarily on the peripheral mechanism. There are effective complementary medicines like dietary supplements of curcumin, vitamins, lipolic acid, omega-3, capsaicin, along with yoga intervention, and ayurveda practices that target all three orders of neurons; thus, suggesting a multimodal, customised treatment for each patient.60Patient’s responses to therapies vary greatly from one another. Hence, a combination of Ayurveda and yoga can serve the patient well.

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, advocates the use of various herbo-mineral formulations for pain relief. Several commonly used components in these formulations have individually demonstrated efficacy in managing pain and inflammation.

Because OA pain is multifaceted, a biopsychosocial strategy that incorporates both yoga and Ayurveda provide a thorough approach to address pain processing, central sensitisation, and neuroinflammation (Figure 1). Pharmacological therapies mostly target the management of peripheral symptoms, whereas yoga and Ayurveda target the underlying neuroimmune dysregulation by working on the psycho-neuro-immune-axis that contributes to the persistence of chronic pain.31,96Yoga and Ayurveda pose positive results in managing obesity, which plays a pivotal role in OA.97–99The increased mechanical load, as well as adipose tissue dysfunction, adversely impacts immune cells that can lead to central sensitisation.97Further, Ayurveda promotes food as medicine, and yoga promotes healthier eating behaviours.100Thus, the two approaches bring about positive lifestyle changes in the individual. There exists an analogy at the theoretical aspect of the two with,Trigunatheory of Yoga(Satva, rajas and tamas)seeking a balance among the three components, like thetridosha (Vata, pitta and Kapha)theory of Ayurveda. Together, these two can provide better health outcomes in OA management.Table 1shows various RCTs that used yoga and Ayurveda in managing OA.

Although integrative approaches like yoga and Ayurveda have shown promise in managing OA, several critical gaps hinder their widespread clinical adoption. There is a pressing need for high-quality, large-scale RCTs with strong methodology, appropriate blinding, and long-term follow-up to generate strong evidence for their efficacy and safety.77Most existing studies suffer from small sample sizes, heterogeneous outcome measures, a limited theoretical framework, a rationale for the choice of the comparator and variability in intervention delivery, limiting their generalizability.101Further, the lack of standardised therapeutic protocols for Yoga and Ayurveda remains a significant barrier. Currently, interventions vary widely in terms of duration, intensity, sequencing, dosage, and practitioner expertise. Standardising these practices, while allowing for some degree of variation, is crucial for reproducibility and comparison across studies. The development of consensus guidelines informed by traditional texts and clinical evidence would enhance scientific rigour and acceptance in mainstream healthcare.102Integration of modern biomedical tools, such as neuroimaging and biomarker-based assessments, is essential to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of these therapies. Functional MRI, PET scans, and inflammatory or neurotrophic biomarkers can help demonstrate how mind-body interventions modulate neural circuits involved in pain perception, inflammation, and central sensitisation. This integration will facilitate translational research and validate the neurophysiological basis of traditional practices.

Future research should therefore aim to develop an evidence-based, individualised, and technology-enabled integrative care model for OA, which not only addresses symptomatic relief but also targets disease mechanisms, including central sensitisation, ultimately reducing dependency on long-term pharmacotherapy, for a healthier tomorrow.

The interplay between neuroinflammation, central sensitisation, and chronic pain in OA necessitates a paradigm shift in its treatment strategies. Conventional pharmacological interventions, while effective in managing acute pain and inflammation, fail to address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms contributing to chronic OA pain. Ayurveda and Yoga offer a promising, integrative approach to OA management, providing neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and autonomic regulatory benefits. Ayurvedic herbs such as Ashwagandha, Guggul, Ginger and Curcumin act through cytokine modulation and oxidative stress reduction, while Yoga, Pranayama, and mindfulness-based interventions enhance neuroplasticity, regulate the HPA axis, and improve endogenous pain inhibition. Together, the two approaches work holistically on the bio-psycho-social model of the individual with a potential contribution towards eudemonic wellbeing. In addition to assessing the therapeutic potential of Ayurvedic and yoga-based therapies in regulating pain pathways, this review combines recent studies on neuroinflammation and central sensitisation in OA. This comprehensive viewpoint on indigenous medical approaches, combining knowledge from clinical research, neurology, and traditional medicine, will add value to managing the global rise in the burden of OA.
