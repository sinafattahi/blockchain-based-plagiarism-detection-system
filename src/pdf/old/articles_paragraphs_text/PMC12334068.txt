Setting: The study was planned with the objective of developing a balanced diet menu based on Indian traditional food items, incorporating formatted fat and 50% of energy from carbohydrates, in line with general dietary recommendations. This was undertaken in the absence of any clear, viable, or India-specific menus or guidelines for constructing such a diet. The fat formatting, guided by metabolic expert recommendations and derived from routine/local foods, adds a unique aspect to the newly formulated menu.

Objective: This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of designing a complete balanced diet of 2000 calories, providing 50% of energy from carbohydrates, using commonly consumed Indian food items. The menu also aims to balance fat intake by providing equal amounts of saturated and unsaturated fats.

Results: It was possible to formulate a balanced diet menu with mathematically derived estimates for energy contribution, fat composition, and other nutrient values. The resulting menu was deficient in only four nutrients, sodium, chloride, iodine, and fluoride, which are not expected to be adequately supplied by the chosen food items alone (e.g., sodium and chloride from table salt, iodine from iodized salt or marine foods, and fluoride from drinking water).

Conclusions: Although predictive, the model and its methodology provide a practical framework for designing metabolically targeted diets for various health conditions, with minimal resource waste. The included tables can also serve as tools for assessing nutritional content both before and after cooking. Importantly, the proposed menu’s use of familiar and affordable food items may enhance acceptability and feasibility among Indian populations.

Although most advanced reference books on internal medicine do not specify the daily recommended amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats for individuals with diabetes, some published studies have reported improvements in glycemic control among those following the traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) or the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, both of which derive 50.00%-55.00% of total energy from carbohydrates [1-5]. However, sample diets from these categories often feature foods commonly found in the Mediterranean region or Western countries, which may be scarce or expensive in India. To address this gap, the authors developed a prototype menu designed to provide 50.00% of total energy from carbohydrates using rice and other routinely used food items commonly found in Indian households, specifically for diabetic Indian adults. Key features of the proposed menu include rice and wheat as the primary cereals, milk as the main source of first-class protein, and a balanced fat profile, equal proportions of saturated fat (SAFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), with an omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio of 4:1 [6-11]. The technical value of this model lies in its capacity to provide mathematically derived predictions of nutritional quality, enabling easy adaptation for metabolically targeted diets for other health conditions. Socioeconomically, the model is likely to gain wide acceptance in the Indian context, owing to its reliance on familiar ingredients and minimal cost. As an alternative to established models like the TMD and ADA diets, and composed of culturally familiar food items, the new formulation may be easier to clinically evaluate, potentially bypassing the need for extensive xenobiotic assessments, such as toxicological testing or animal trials.

The general methodology involved screening 592 widely available food items in India and organizing them into columns (items) and rows (nutritive values) for further calculation and analysis.

The first step in designing a menu to derive 50.00% of total energy (i.e., 1,000.00 out of 2,000.00 calories) from carbohydrates, while adhering to traditional food habits, involved the initial selection of 250.00 g of rice (since 1 g of carbohydrate provides 4 kcal, 1,000 ÷ 4 = 250). This was later adjusted to 130.00 g of rice, along with the addition of 50.00 g of whole wheat flour (atta), for reasons explained below [12]. Given that diabetes mellitus is a cellular metabolic disorder characterized by impaired energy extraction from carbohydrates, the caloric contribution from protein, requiring higher energy expenditure for metabolism, was limited to 14.00% (i.e., 280.00 calories), which lies at the upper end of the normal range. Consequently, fat was set at 36.00% of total energy, considering it to be the easiest macronutrient to metabolize with the lowest specific dynamic action.

To meet the protein requirement (280 ÷ 4 = 70.00 g), 70.00 g of cowpea seeds were chosen for their traditional use and availability as a protein-rich pulse. However, rice, wheat, and cowpeas are not pure macronutrient sources. For instance, per 100.00 g, rice contains 77.16 g carbohydrates (excluding 3.74 g fiber) and 7.81 g protein; wheat contains 64.17 g carbohydrates (excluding 11.36 g fiber) and 10.57 g protein; and cowpeas contain 49.40 g carbohydrates (excluding 10.60 g fiber) and 23.50 g protein [13]. Thus, the combined cereal-pulse selection yielded only 166.97 g of carbohydrates and 31.89 g of protein, falling short of the targeted 250.00 g and 70.00 g, respectively, leaving daily deficits of 83.03 g of carbohydrate and 38.11 g of protein. These deficits were evaluated and found to be appropriate for being fulfilled by additional food items yet to be added (such as protective foods for vitamins and minerals, and fat sources). This justified both the revised quantity of rice and the inclusion of whole wheat flour (Table1, Block A: I; Supplemental material 1).

CHO: carbohydrate, SAFA: saturated fatty acid, MUFA: monounsaturated fatty acid, PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acid, O6: omega-6 acid, O3omega-3 acid.

†Glycemic index: wheat whole flour, 68; arrowroot flour, 65.

The cereal-pulse combination provided 2.37 g of fat, along with essential amino acids such as histidine, tryptophan, threonine, and the phenylalanine-tyrosine pair, in the required amounts. Additionally, it supplied adequate levels of folate, iron, copper, chromium, molybdenum, and manganese (Table2; Supplemental materials 1 and 2).

-No data available on the detectable amount available in the specified quantity.

For the second step of the workup, since no natural dietary fat sources were found to contain equal amounts of saturated (SAFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) with an internal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 4:1, the authors attempted to formulate a suitable combination of fat-rich foods (“fat combination”) that would meet these criteria as part of the menu.

To fulfill the remaining 36.00% of energy from fat (720.00 calories), an initial quota of 80.00 g of oils was tried (i.e., 720 ÷ 9 = 80), empirically selecting one predominant source for each fat type: coconut oil (SAFA), rice bran oil (MUFA), and sesame oil (PUFA), all locally available. However, using only these oils failed to address the carbohydrate and protein deficits inherent to the cereal-pulse combination. Thus, the trials were repeated with added oilseeds and milk. The final combination (Table1, Block A: II; Table3; Supplemental Material 3) included sesame oil, rice bran oil, rice bran, flaxseed, coconut, milk, fenugreek seeds, and olive oil [6,12,14-19]. Together, these items contributed approximately 37.00 g of carbohydrate and 30.00 g of protein, reducing the deficits from -83.03 g to -45.68 g for carbohydrates, and from -38.11 g to -8.63 g for proteins (Table1, Block A: II). Notably, the protein from flaxseed and milk was of first-class quality, being rich in essential amino acids.

SAFA: saturated fatty acid, MUFA: monounsaturated fatty acid, PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acids.

The total amount of rice bran oil is 38.25 g (items 5 + 6).

‡Regarding the totals, variations in the total values of the bottom row (around 26.70 g, within a ±0.30 g range) are due to the unique natural composition of the oils used and the rounding of their quantities to whole numbers or 0.25 g increments.

The specific quantities of fat sources were determined by calculating the amount of each item needed to provide the required quantity of a particular type of fat (e.g., MUFA) for the trial menu, while also contributing other fat types. This was done by multiplying the reciprocal of the fraction of a specific fat type in a food item by the desired amount of that fat type. In other words, to obtain “Y” grams of a particular fat (e.g., MUFA) from 100.00 g of an oil that contains “X” grams of it, the formula used was:
(100 ÷ X) × Y. To balance the total contributions of SAFA, MUFA, and PUFA to approximately 26.70 g each, and to ensure adequate intake of vitamin B12, milk, commonly consumed in Indian villages, was added to the combination. Flaxseeds (rather than flaxseed oil) were included as the main source of omega-3 fatty acids, due to their wider availability across India. Additionally, fenugreek seeds were incorporated for their traditionally recognized antidiabetic properties.

The above combination clearly presents SAFA, MUFA, and PUFA components in roughly equal amounts (26.70 g each), with minor variations of ±0.30 g due to the natural variability in oil composition and the rounding of oil quantities to whole or 0.25 g increments.

At this stage of formulation, analysis of the fat sources showed that, except for the oils present in flaxseed and fenugreek seeds, which contained only omega-6 fatty acids in their PUFA fractions, the combination provided a total of 21.60 g of omega-6 fatty acids (Table1, Block B: I; Table3) [6,12-19].

To maintain an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 4:1, the remaining portion of the PUFA compartment (26.87 g - 21.60 g = 5.27 g) needed to be supplied by omega-3 fatty acids. In the final formulation, this was achieved through 9.50 g of flaxseed oil contained in 22.50 g of flaxseed, which contributes 5.13 g of omega-3 and 1.33 g of omega-6 fatty acids within its 6.46 g PUFA fraction. An additional 0.14 g of omega-3 fatty acids was derived from 12.50 g of fenugreek seeds. Thus, the resulting omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in the PUFA compartment was 4:1. The flaxseed quantity was rounded up to 22.50 g to facilitate practical measurement in the kitchen, equivalent to approximately nine teaspoons of powdered flaxseed.

After incorporating the fat source combination, the remaining deficits stood at -45.68 g for carbohydrate and -8.63 g for protein, these being the unresolved shortfalls from the original cereal-pulse combination following the addition of the fat sources. These gaps were expected to be filled by the carbohydrate and protein content of the yet-to-be-added protective foods. Up to this point, the cereal-pulse and fat source combination had already contributed a substantial amount of dietary fiber (35.79 g), which is equivalent to 94.18% of the recommended daily intake (Table1, Block A: II; Supplemental Material 1).

The inclusion of fat sources also led to a marked increase in the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, vitamin B12, phosphorus, magnesium, selenium, and all essential amino acids, bringing these nutrients well above their daily adequacy levels. However, a few protective nutrients remained deficient. While vitamins A, D, and K showed some improvement, they still remained below recommended levels, as did iodine and fluoride, which continued at zero due to their absence in both the cereal-pulse and fat source combinations (Table4; Supplemental Material 4).

*Values for vitamins E and K reflect the total oil fraction; all other values are derived from rice bran and coconut meat only.

†Nutrient levels elevated to meet daily requirements by the addition of fat sources.

-No data available on the detectable amount in the mentioned quantity.

At this stage, it became evident that the selection of protective food items for the menu had to address all remaining nutrient deficits without contributing significantly to additional fat intake. Since the formulation was intended for a specific geographic population with generally low income and distinct food customs, both local availability and traditional dietary patterns were taken into account. As such, the protective food items listed in Table1(Block A: III; Indian gooseberry, arrowroot flour, onion stalk, chili powder, drumstick leaves, ash gourd, fresh ginger, and raw guava) were selected [12,20-22]. An additional consideration was the inclusion of locally available bulk-forming foods commonly used in the Indian diet (e.g., ash gourd and drumstick leaves) to promote satiety ("hunger-killing") without significantly increasing caloric intake, thus helping prevent overconsumption of calorie-dense foods.

The protective food items listed in Table1(Block A: III) provided sufficient amounts of carbohydrate and protein (45.84 g and 8.66 g, respectively) to fully meet the final daily deficits remaining after the addition of the fat sources. The slight excess (45.84 g vs. 45.68 g of carbohydrate and 8.66 g vs. 8.63 g of protein) is clinically negligible. These food items also addressed the fiber shortfall and improved the levels of most protective nutrients, while contributing a minor excess of 1.84 g of fat (Tables5and 6; Supplemental Materials 5 and 6).

This predominantly vegetarian menu formulation for the prototype balanced diet provided adequate amounts of proximate nutrients, essential amino acids, dietary fiber, and most key vitamins. However, it revealed partial deficiencies in certain protective nutrients, specifically sodium and chloride, and complete deficiencies in iodine and fluoride (Table7) [23,24]. In total, the newly developed menu, designed to incorporate 43 nutrients (comprising 6 macronutrients (including specific fat components), 10 essential amino acids, and 27 protective nutrients), showed deficiencies in only four protective nutrients upon completion of the tabulation. The reasons for these deficiencies and potential solutions are discussed below. Importantly, none of the nutrients exceeded their respective "tolerable upper intake levels" (TULs; Supplemental Material 2) [25].

*12,086.84 mcg beta-carotene and 270.00 mcg retinol.

-No data available on the detectable amount in the mentioned quantity.

Deficiencies of sodium and chloride can be managed through the currently recommended minimum daily intake of table salt, 4.40 g/day (75.00 meq) [26].

Daily intake of body-stored nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B12 is not strictly required. Nonetheless, this formulation provides adequate levels of vitamins A, D, E, and K. Notably, the region’s nearly year-round sun exposure naturally supports sufficient vitamin D synthesis. Among the included food items, milk alone accounts for the full daily vitamin B12 requirement (2.40 mcg), and it remains a staple in the diet of Indian village farmers, who form a major part of the population.

Fluoride and iodine, also body-stored nutrients, remain deficient in the new menu. Fluoride is generally not obtained through food, and iodine availability in vegetables varies depending on the iodine content of the soil, which is higher in coastal regions. Due to these factors, reliable generalized nutritive data for these nutrients are not available (from both cited and additional reference sources), making it difficult to estimate their intake from this menu.

We therefore recommend the regular use of iodized salt as the primary source of dietary iodine. India’s public health infrastructure ensures its widespread availability. Alternatively, including sea products in the diet, along with corresponding adjustments to the food list and nutrient tabulation, can help meet iodine needs.

Fluoride intake, on the other hand, mainly comes from drinking water. In most parts of India, fluoride levels in water are around 0.50 mg/L, which is generally sufficient for preventing deficiency, especially given the higher water consumption typical in tropical regions [27]. In areas with low fluoride levels in water, supplementation through water fluoridation, fluoridated foods, toothpastes, or other means is recommended.

Lastly, a small amount of additional fat (1.84 g, or 1.50 g depending on the source) came from the protective food items (Table5). However, due to its minimal quantity, it was not included in the initial fat combination structure (Table1, Block B: II), as it was too minor to affect the formulation.

A non-diabetic adult requiring 2,000 calories per day typically derives 50%-60% of these calories from carbohydrates, 10%-14% from proteins, and the remainder from fats, without exceeding 30% (or 80 g) of total calories from fat [20,24,28]. In diabetes mellitus, although the cellular mechanism for energy extraction from carbohydrates is impaired, the overall daily energy requirement remains unchanged. Therefore, the most appropriate nutritional strategy is to reduce the carbohydrate load while proportionally increasing protein and fat intake to meet energy needs. This principle is already reflected in traditional diabetic diets such as the TMD and the ADA sample plans. However, similar dietetic models using routine Indian food items remained largely conceptual. It was in this context, where both standardized menu plans and formulation guidelines for Indian diets were lacking, that the authors designed the present study. The proposed work introduces a model menu formulated with mathematically predicted nutrient values, using traditional Indian foods in culturally typical quantities. Beyond serving as a prototype, this formulation offers a practical framework for developing other metabolically targeted diets. It also helps reduce the cost and inefficiency of clinical trials by minimizing reliance on random or poorly planned dietary models. Since this menu is a nutritionally equivalent adaptation of well-established models like TMD and ADA, it can be clinically evaluated for its therapeutic value upon ethical committee approval and laboratory confirmation of the calculated nutrient contents. Furthermore, the formulation methodology and its accompanying interim evaluation tables can serve as nutritional assessment tools for both traditional and newly designed diet plans, before and after actual recipe preparation.

The source recommending the consumption of equal amounts of SAFA, MUFA, and PUFA is the Dietary Goals for the United States, 1977 [7]. This guideline was selected for constructing the new menu because it was the first to clearly suggest the proportionate intake of each type of fat, following the initial dietary recommendations introduced by the American Heart Association in 1957 [29]. Technically, to translate these fat requirements into numerical values, i.e., the specific amounts of SAFA, MUFA, and PUFA, explicit recommendations on the percentage requirement of each component are essential. However, both earlier and later dietary guidelines have generally lacked such clarity, particularly regarding MUFA and PUFA requirements. This absence of detailed guidance makes it challenging to advise or prescribe specific menus for patients [30]. Possibly due to this technical clarity, many medical textbooks and educators during the 1980s and 1990s referred to the 1977 recommendations as the “classic” guidelines. These continue to be highlighted, especially when paired with the later-established 4:1 ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, together often cited as the “classic recommendations” for dietary fat consumption.

The menu formulation developed in this study is specifically designed to meet the caloric and protective nutrient needs of a diabetic adult with minimal physical exertion (i.e., a 2,000-calorie requirement). For other individuals, such as diabetic adults with higher energy demands, the energy distribution percentages (from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) may need adjustment based on the intensity and type of physical activity (e.g., brisk versus sustained exertion) before applying this methodology. In cases of comorbid conditions (such as liver disease), both the daily caloric target and the choice of food items may also require appropriate modification.

Finally, it is important to remember that the selection of food items in menu formulations must be adjusted to account for quantitative and qualitative variations in nutritional requirements among diabetic individuals, based on factors such as age, sex, and physiological status (e.g., pregnancy). These considerations are equally relevant to the non-diabetic population.

Since this study is predictive in nature, the projected nutritional values must be validated through post-cooking analysis of the prepared recipes. If any nutrient, particularly those not stored in the body, is found to be below the required daily level, a step-by-step reassessment should be carried out. This may involve examining cooking methods, post-harvest storage practices, or pre-cooking nutrient content of ingredients. Any identified issue should be corrected to ensure nutritional adequacy before initiating clinical dietary trials using this or any similar predictive menu formulation.

From a nutritional perspective, the most logical way to manage the metabolic condition of diabetes mellitus is by rearranging the pattern of energy derivation, specifically, through a controlled reduction in carbohydrate intake and compensatory increases in protein and fat intake. In line with this approach, the authors have successfully proposed a target-oriented menu formulation composed primarily of low-glycemic-index local Indian food items (G.I. < 55), using a straightforward methodology to support the overall well-being of diabetic adults. Notably, in this formulation, the carbohydrate-derived energy from rice and wheat, the “key foods,” does not dominate the total carbohydrate share but instead contributes nearly equally with the rest of the items, at 26.48% and 23.52%, respectively. The methodology is flexible enough to design metabolically targeted menu formulations tailored to various physiological and clinical needs, enabling diverse food cultures worldwide to adopt contextually balanced diets using locally available foods, while preserving traditional tastes and minimizing costs.

Importantly, this is the first instance in diabetic nutrition where a complete balanced diet has been developed using everyday Indian food items, with carbohydrate-derived energy restricted to 50%. The inclusion of fat components derived in precise proportions from constituent food items also introduces a novel concept to diabetic dietary planning.
