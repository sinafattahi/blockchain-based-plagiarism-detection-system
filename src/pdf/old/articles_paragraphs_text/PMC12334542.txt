Alexandrium pacificum,a globally distributed dinoflagellate, is well-known for causing harmful algal blooms and producing Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PSTs), a threat to marine life and human health. The frequency and intensity ofAlexandriumblooms have increased in recent decades, driven, in some cases, by increasing temperatures. Here, we investigated the temperature-dependent (15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C) growth rates and paralytic shellfish toxin profiles of eightA. pacificumstrains while concurrently examining differences in sequences of the saxitoxin biosynthetic gene,sxtA4. While maximum cell densities were lowest at 30 °C, toxin production per cell was highest at higher temperatures that inhibited growth, with greater diversity of toxin analogs peaking at 30 °C, as confirmed by the higher Shannon’s diversity index obtained for the toxin profiles with the increasing temperatures. Furthermore, genetic analysis of thesxtA4gene showed that greater genetic diversity—quantified by nucleotide diversity (π) ranging from 9.91 to 30.21 across strains—was positively correlated with this wider array of toxin analogs (Shannon’s diversity index;p< 0.0001). Conserved regions within the gene were identified, suggesting that these regions may play important structural or functional roles in the saxitoxin biosynthetic pathway. These findings highlight the role of temperature, genetic diversity, andsxtA4conserved regions in influencing toxin production and profiles inAlexandrium. Further research into the genetic mechanisms underlying saxitoxin biosynthesis will improve our understanding ofAlexandrium’s adaptability to changing temperatures. Such insights are essential for effective ecosystem management and safeguarding public health.

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur when algae grow to high levels, often producing toxins that may harm humans and/or aquatic ecosystems. These events are a global phenomenon, impacting coastal and freshwater systems worldwide [3,6,7,30,36,41,59]. Among the species responsible for marine HABs, some species ofAlexandrium, a genus of dinoflagellate, have attracted significant attention due to their ability to produce saxitoxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) [37,64,84]. The frequency and intensity ofAlexandriumblooms have been rising worldwide, leading to an increase in PSP events and associated disruptions to marine ecosystems and fisheries, with significant economic impacts (Supplementary Figure1,[9,36,63,66]). In some cases, the geographic range ofAlexandriumblooms are expanding due to rising temperatures, especially within higher latitude regions [7,25,31,55]. However, as environmental conditions continue to shift due to climate change, predicting the long-term dynamics ofAlexandriumblooms remains challenging because of the ecological complexity associated with these blooms [12,60].

One of the key factors fostering the ecological complexity ofAlexandriumblooms in marine environments may stem from its genetic diversity. Genetic diversity within a population can influence physiological traits, including growth, toxin production, and bloom dynamics. This diversity often allows a species to adapt to environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, salinity, light, nutrient, and grazing pressure [4,13,21,22,76,89]. Among these traits, toxin production is particularly relevant for bloom dynamics and ecological interactions. The biosynthesis of paralytic shellfish toxins is a complex, multistep process involving a suite of enzymes encoded within thesxtgene cluster [51,61]. This modular biosynthetic pathway is initiated by the enzymesxtA, which catalyzes the first committed step by converting arginine into a key intermediate. ThesxtAgene comprises four functional domains, among which domain 4 (sxtA4) encodes an aminotransferase essential for initiating toxin synthesis [67,70]. As the enzyme responsible for the initial transamination step,sxtA4functions as a molecular gatekeeper of the entire PST pathway—without its activity, downstream toxin biosynthesis cannot proceed [19]. Subsequent steps involve core biosynthetic enzymes such assxtG,sxtB, andsxtD, which construct the tricyclic saxitoxin backbone, followed by a series of tailoring enzymes includingsxtSUL,sxtX,sxtH/T, andsxtUthat introduce various chemical modifications to produce a structurally diverse array of PST analogs [33,67,68]. Notably,sxtA4is generally detected only in toxigenicAlexandriumspecies and is absent or undetectable in non-toxic strains, underscoring its critical role in toxin biosynthesis [19,67,68,87]. Due to its functional centrality, variation insxtA4gene sequences and expression levels has been proposed as a key factor explaining intraspecific differences in toxin production [19,29,88]. Its restricted presence in toxigenic lineages and functional indispensability also makesxtA4a valuable molecular marker for predicting the toxin-producing potential ofAlexandriumpopulations in natural environments [29,68,81].

ToxicAlexandriumspecies show considerable inter- and intraspecific variability in toxin production, reflected in both total toxin amount and the toxin composition [13,34,80,91]. One potential source of this variability is the high genetic diversity observed within toxin biosynthesis genes, such assxtA4. Interestingly, high genetic diversity of the saxitoxin biosynthetic initiating gene (sxtA4) was found within a single strain ofA. pacificum,ACCC01 [94]. Also, the genetic diversity of this gene was observed in 11A. minutumstrains, with a unique allelic form in two non-toxic strains and varying copies (1-46) of genetically diversesxtA4mRNA sequences in the toxic strains [29]. This suggests that the high genetic diversity of toxin-producing genes may contribute to the ecological adaptation ofAlexandriumpopulations to fluctuating and stressful environments. Despite these insights, the relationship betweensxtA4genetic variation and actual differences in toxin profiles remains poorly understood. Limited studies have explored the association between the genetic diversity of thesxtA4gene inAlexandriumand how it is related to intraspecific variation in toxin production (e.g., toxin composition and/or toxin profile) amongAlexandriumspecies. Therefore, further research is necessary to elucidate whethersxtA4diversity alone can account for the observed physiological variation or whether interactions with downstream genes also play a significant role.

Among the toxicAlexandriumspecies, A. pacificumis a dinoflagellate species known for its rapid growth, causing dense blooms in estuarine and coastal waters worldwide (Supplementary Figure2), with significant ecological and economic impacts [2,44,77]. Extensive ecophysiological studies have investigated toxin production and bloom formation mechanisms inA. pacificumspecies [1,15,39,46,57,58,75,83],Van [92,93,95]. Despite these efforts, the underlying mechanisms of how environmental factors drive intraspecific variation in toxin production remain largely unclear, as most studies—typically based on fewer than three strains—offer only a limited view of strain-level variability [1,57,93]. In fact, nearly all studies cited above used a small number of strains (often one or two), which may constrain our understanding of the full extent of physiological and toxin production diversity withinAlexandriumspecies.

To better understand the association between the genetic diversity of thesxtA4gene and intraspecific variation in toxin production, it is essential to deepen our understanding of the species’ genetic and ecological variability by examining a larger number of strains. Therefore, in this study, we isolated eightA. pacificumstrains from the Korean coastal waters to investigate their physiological characteristics (Supplementary Figure3–4), particularly in relation to growth responses and toxin production under varying temperatures. In addition, by cloning and sequencing thesxtA4gene in each strain, we aim to investigate whether genetic variation in this domain may be associated with differences in toxin production. This research contributes to a broader understanding of how genetic diversity within the species may drive ecological interactions, ultimately informing future strategies for HAB management in a changing ocean environment.

This study examined eight strains ofA. pacificum. Strains LIMS-PS-2760 (L60) and LIMS-PS-2762 (L62) were obtained by germination of cysts isolated from Masan Bay, South Korea (35° 07′ 30.0″ N, 128° 36′ 19.2″ E), in October 2018. These two strains are collectively referred to as the LIMS group in this study. Strains KM1 – KM6 (KM group) were isolated from vegetative cells in seawater samples collected from Dadaepo, Busan, South Korea (35° 03′ 24.5″ N, 128° 58′ 28.8″ E), in May, 2020 (Supplementary Figure3). Details regarding algal culture conditions, including isolation methods, specific growth rates, and species identification, are provided in the supplementary information. Prior to the initiation of growth experiments, the eightA. pacificumstrains, initially cultured at 20 °C, were gradually acclimated to each test temperature. Cultures were first transferred to 15 °C and 25 °C and maintained at these temperatures for one week. Following this, cultures acclimated to 25 °C were transferred to 30 °C and incubated for additional three days, as prolonged exposure to 30 °C often leads to rapid cell mortality. Then, the cultures were inoculated in triplicate into 25 cm2plastic tissue culture flasks filled with fresh F/2 media with a final cell density of 200 cells mL−1(final volume of 50 mL). Cultures were incubated under each temperature. Growth was monitored at intervals ranging from 1 to 4 days (on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36). Experiments were concluded individually for each strain once the culture reached the stationary phase, resulting in variable end points among the eight strains. A 1 mL aliquot of each flask was fixed with Lugol’s solution (Daejung Chemical, Korea) at a final concentration of 1%. Cell counts were performed using an inverted light microscope (Eclipse Ti-U; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 40× magnification with a Sedgewick-Rafter counting chamber. Between 200 and 400 cells were counted per sample to ensure statistical reliability while maintaining efficiency [24,50]. Growth curve was determined from an average of triplicate cultures. At the end of the experiments, cells were harvested via centrifugation at 4000×g for 30 min at 4 °C and stored at –20 °C until HPLC analysis of PSTs [72].

PSTs in cell pellets were extracted with 1.0 mL of 0.03 M acetic acid by multiple freezing/thawing cycles [73,90] and sonicated (Branson Sonifier 150; Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, USA) in ice for 1 min. Disruption of algal cells was observed under an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-U; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Extracts were passed through a 0.2-μm nylon filter before high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.

PSTs were analyzed using HPLC-FLD with post-column oxidation, with slight modifications of the methods described in Krock et al. [56] (Supplementary Table1). Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (6 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid and 6 mM 1-heptanesulfonic acid in 40 mM ammonium phosphate adjusted to pH 7.0/0.75% THF, v/v) and solvent B (13 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid in 50 mM phosphoric acid adjusted to pH 6.9/15% acetonitrile/1.5% THF, v/v). The autosampler was cooled to 4 °C. The eluent from the column was continuously oxidized with 10 mM of periodic acid in 550 mM ammonium hydroxide and continuously acidified with 0.75 N nitric acid in a reaction coil set at 60 °C. The fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 333 and 395 nm, respectively. All samples were analyzed on a Waters e2695 HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a 2475 FLR detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm,Phenomenex, Germany). Data acquisition and processing were performed using the Empower 3 software.

whereH′is the Shannon diversity index,Sis Simpson diversity index,sis the number of toxin analogs, andpiis the amount of toxin analog produced of each strain. The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were used to assess toxin diversity. The Shannon index typically ranges from 0 to ~ 3.5 in ecological studies, with higher values indicating greater diversity and a more even distribution of toxin analogs [62]. The Simpson index ranges from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 reflect higher diversity and values near 0 indicate dominance by one or a few analogs [40]. Simpson’s index represents the probability that two randomly selected individuals belong to different toxin types. The calculated Shannon and Simpson diversity indices for each strain across four temperature conditions were visualized using violin plots. These plots were generated to display the distribution and median values of toxin diversity indices across all eight strains per temperature condition (n= 8). In each plot, the width of the violin represents the probability density of the data at different values, with wider sections indicating more frequent observations. The central black line within each violin denotes the median diversity index. This graphical approach highlights both the central tendency and the variability in toxin diversity across temperature treatments, facilitating visual comparison of trends among temperature groups.

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed to describe thesxtA4gene sequence variation among/within strains in Arlequin v3.5.2.2 [27]. Details regarding PCR amplification and cloning, and the phylogenetic analysis of thesxtA4gene are provided in supplementary information. The AMOVA is based on an analysis of the variance of gene frequencies, considering the number of mutational differences between sequences. A function of the number of polymorphic sites and frequency of transition/transversion and insertion/deletion, was also calculated using the program Arlequin. Minimum spanning network using pairwise differences was constructed to determine absolute distances between sequences. Using the de novo assembly tool in the Geneious software (Version 11.1.2), 160 sequences were classified based on SNP positions. Due to the nature of de novo assembly, which combines the most similar sequences based on sequence similarity, this method generates contigs that reflect the observed variation patterns.

The cloning sequences were translated into amino acid sequences using Geneious software. Open Reading Frames (ORFs) were predicted by the ORF Finder tool on the NCBI website, with a cut-off of 90 nucleotides. Search was conducted in all three reading frames (1, 2, and 3) to identify genes associated with increased diversity resulting from frame shifts. Protein function annotations were then identified using InterProScan by querying its available databases [48]. Similarity of nucleotide sequences and translated amino acid sequences were analyzed using the Biostrings and dplyr packages in the R software (Version 4.2.3) to determine the extent of variation at each position due to the SNPs (Müller, 2020; R Core Team, 2023). A total of 166sxtA4gene nucleotide sequences and 54 protein sequences from dinoflagellatesAlexandrium,Gymnodinium, andPyrodiniumwere retrieved from the NCBI database, and their sequence similarity was analyzed. The results were subsequently visualized with ggplot2. Sequence similarity analysis was conducted by distinguishing between sequences with the identified domain associated with the function ofsxtA4and those without it.

To investigate the potential functional consequences of the observed genetic diversity in thesxtA4gene, we predicted and compared the 3D protein structures encoded by eightAlexandrium pacificumstrains. Because sequence variations in thesxtA4gene may lead to structural and functional differences in the encoded protein, we focused on predicting the structural consequences of such genetic variation. ThesxtA4gene encodes an aminotransferase domain that initiates the biosynthesis of saxitoxin; therefore, even minor sequence variations could result in structural and potentially functional divergence among strains.

Protein structures were predicted using AlphaFold2 [49,65] based on translated amino acid sequences (Supplementary video1). The reliability of each residue was assessed using the Predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) score, where values above 90 indicate high confidence, scores between 70 and 90 reflect moderate confidence, and values below 70 represent low confidence. The predicted TM-score (pTM) was used to evaluate structural similarity, with a pTM value greater than 0.8 suggesting a very high likelihood that the predicted structure closely resembles experimentally determined structures.

To further assess structural variation across strains, we used the Dali web server to compare protein structures and obtain similarityZ-scores [42]. Generally, aZ-score above 20 indicates that the two structures are definitively homologous, while a score between 8 and 20 suggests they are likely homologous. In contrast, TM scores obtained from the Universal Structural Alignment (US-align) program [98] assess the structural homology between the query protein and the reference arginine aminotransferase (PDB ID: 6KFR), which is associated with the function of thesxtA4gene. The TM-score ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating an identical structural match. A TM-score of 0.5 (or 0.45) or higher suggests that the structures share the same global topology for proteins. These structural comparisons allowed us to assess whether the observed nucleotide-level diversity insxtA4leads to potential differences in protein topology and thus may influence toxin biosynthetic capacity across strains.

All statistical tests for growth rate, toxin data, and diversity indices were conducted at a significance level of α = 0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 9 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The assumption of normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and homogeneity of variances was assessed using Levene’s test. For growth rate, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD post hoc test was performed to identify differences among temperature treatments. As the toxin data did not meet the assumptions of normality, a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used, followed by Dunn’s post hoc test with Dunn–Šidák correction to identify pairwise differences among treatments. Statistical analyses of the Shannon’s and Simpson’s diversity indices were performed using ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s HSD post hoc test to evaluate significant differences among temperature treatments. All statistical results, including exactp-values, are provided in Supplementary Tables2–7. Additionally, linear regression analysis was conducted using SigmaPlot version 14.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) embedded SigmaStat to examine the effect of genetic diversity on toxin diversity, with genetic diversity (measured byπ) as the independent variable and toxin diversity (assessed using Shannon’s diversity index) as the dependent variable. Following this, a second linear regression analysis explored the relationship between the number of representative sequence present in each strain and toxin richness. Lastly, a linear regression analysis assessed the correlation between the similarity scores (Z-scores) of predicted protein structures derived from 20 sequences of each strain and the toxin richness at 20 °C. Statistical significance was evaluated at a level ofp< 0.05 to determine the strength and relevance of the relationships among the variables.

The incubation of eightA. pacificumstrains at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 °C) revealed that 20 °C was the optimum growth temperature based on the maximum cell densities, with the average ranging from 2,470 to 4,383 cells mL⁻1, showing substantial variations in maximum cell density among the strains (Figure1A–H). Additionally, the minimum growth temperature was found to be 30°. Only KM2, KM3, and KM4 showed a slight increase in cell density, reaching maximum densities between 547 and 758 cells mL⁻1, while the other strains exhibited no growth or even cell death throughout the experiment. At 25 °C, maximum cell densities ranged from 1,270 to 2,936 cells mL⁻1. Notably, under 15 °C incubation, all KM cultures exhibited cell growth exceeding 1,100 cells mL⁻1, whereas L60 and L62 showed almost no growth, with an average maximum density of only 374 cells mL⁻1. While the growth patterns were similar among the eight strains at 20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C, a distinct difference was observed at 15 °C. This observation led to the classification of the strains into two groups: the KM strain group (KM 1 to 6), which exhibited a substantial increase in cell density ranging from 5-fold to 18-fold compared to the initial density at 15 °C, and the LIMS group (L60 and L62), which only doubled their cell density at this temperature.

The average growth rate was lowest at 30 °C (0.13 ± 0.09 day⁻1) and 15 °C (0.19 ± 0.09 day⁻1), while higher growth rates were observed at 20 °C (0.38 ± 0.13 day⁻1) and 25 °C (0.37 ± 0.16 day⁻1). These results indicate that growth was generally optimized around 20–25 °C, whereas both lower and higher temperatures suppressed growth across most strains (Figure1I).

Toxin production differed between the strains and across temperatures with increased cellular toxin quotas at temperatures that inhibited growth. KM strains exhibited significantly higher toxin production at 30 °C, ranging from 61.5 to 130.9 fmol cell⁻1, while significantly lower production was observed at temperatures between 15–25 °C, with values ranging from 0.58 to 31.67 fmol cell⁻1(p< 0.05;n= 72; Fig.2A–F). The LIMS strains exhibited significantly higher toxin production at both 15 °C and 30 °C, ranging from 74.21 to 510.00 fmol cell⁻1, whereas lower production was noted at temperatures between 20 and 25 °C, with values ranging from 4.02 to 30.04 fmol cell⁻1(p< 0.05;n= 24). A statistically significant but weak negative relationship was observed between growth rate (day⁻1) and toxin production (cell−1) (Supplementary Fig.7; slope = –0.000431,R2= 0.260,p< 0.05).

The toxin profiles varied among the strains, with KM2 and KM6 producing only C1/2, GTX3, and GTX4 across all temperatures, while KM5 displayed a diverse range of toxin profiles depending on the temperature. Overall, C1/2 and GTX3 were the predominant toxin analogs detected across all temperatures, with the highest toxin richness at 30 °C and the lowest at 15 °C among all strains. These results were supported by the toxin diversity analysis using Shannon’s diversity index. The L60 strain took the lead with the highest average index of 1.03, hinting at a broad spectrum of toxin analogs, while KM5 and KM2 lagged behind at 0.43 and 0.44, respectively. KM4 (0.78), L62 (0.73), and KM6 (0.86) showed moderate diversity, and KM1 and KM3 landed in the middle range with values of 0.63 and 0.66. These differences highlight the strain-specific nature of toxin production even under the same thermal conditions. As the temperature increased, the Shannon index rose from an average of 0.47 at 15 °C to 0.85 at 30 °C, reflecting greater diversity of toxin analogs produced (Figure3A). The statistical analysis, based on the observed increase in Shannon’s diversity index with rising temperature, revealed significant differences between 15 °C and both at 25 °C and 30 °C (p< 0.05,n= 96). Similarly, in terms of Simpson’s diversity index across the four incubation temperatures, strain KM4 stood out with the highest average e value of 0.92, followed closely by KM2 at 0.90. KM1 and KM3 shared a steady average of 0.86, while KM45 KM56 and L60 clustered around the mid-0.7 range. L62, however, consistently showed the lowest average at 0.61, marking it as the most distinct among the group. With increasing temperature, the Simpson’s index decreased from 0.81 at 15 °C to 0.65 at 30 °C (Figure3B), indicating a reduced dominance of specific analogs. Statistical analysis, conducted based on this observed trend, revealed significant differences between 30 °C and both 20 °C and 25 °C (p< 0.05,n= 96).

PCR amplification of thesxtA4gene sequences from eight strains confirmed multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the same position (Supplementary Fig.8). To assess the genetic diversity of the gene, cloning techniques were used, resulting in 160 total sequences (20 from each strain). Among these, 32 sequences were 100% identical sequences found both within the same strain and between different strains (Supplementary Fig.9). The nucleotide diversity (π) values indicated high genetic diversity within strains (Table1). AMOVA results revealed that variation among strains accounts for 3.68% of the total genetic variation, while variation within strains accounts for 96.2% (Supplementary Table6). These results suggest that genetic differences between strains are small, but there is considerable intragenic variation within each strain (n= 160,p< 0.05). Moreover, out of the 32 representative sequences identified from 160 total sequences based on the positions of SNP sites, none was shared across all strains, while only one sequence was unique to a single strain (Fig.4).

A domain search of the 160 translated amino acid sequences revealed that only 87 matched the class-II aminotransferase domain of thesxtA4gene. The remaining sequences resembled pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, part of a homologous superfamily, but did not confirm specific protein functions. The analysis of sequence similarity among the identified domain sequences revealed very high similarity in the 390–430 bp region of the nucleotide sequence, while several positions showed very low similarity (approximately 75%) (Fig.5A, C, E). The translated amino acid sequences containing the identified domain were also found to be highly conserved in the corresponding region (Fig.5B, D, F). In contrast, sequences lacking this domain displayed considerable variability in the same region despite belonging to the homologous superfamily.

The predicted protein structure with the identified domain demonstrated a high average pLDDT score of 84.6 ± 2.15 for most residues, indicating moderate confidence in the model’s accuracy (Supplementary Table7). This score suggests that the predicted 3D structure is likely to match experimentally validated structures. In contrast, proteins lacking the domain had a lower average pLDDT score of 74.7 ± 3.91. The predicted TM-score (pTM) for proteins with the identified domain averaged 0.84 ± 0.02, while those without the domain averaged 0.73 ± 0.05. Analysis of predicted protein structure similarity among the eight strains revealed that KM1 exhibited a very high structural similarity score of 19.6, followed by KM4 with 10.7, while the remaining strains had low similarity scores below 8. Interestingly, protein structures with identified domains all displayed high structural similarity, with DALIZ-scores exceeding 20, which strongly suggests that the structures are homologous. PDB files of these predicted protein structures are provided in the Supplementary Files (Supplementary Data File1).

Although the protein structure of thesxtA4gene has not been elucidated, the predicted protein structures were highly similar to the reference arginine aminotransferase (PDB ID: 6KFR), which is functionally related to thesxtA4gene (Supplementary video2). Given that the reference arginine aminotransferase is 449 bp long and the query sequences range from 113 to 282 bp, structural similarity with this reference protein was analyzed based on the query protein structure, and the resulting similarity was expressed as TM-scores (Supplementary Table7). The protein structures with the domain had a TM-score of 0.74 ± 0.01 on average, while those without the domain showed a TM-score of 0.63 ± 0.05. This high score indicates a strong structural similarity between the two, implying that the amplification of thesxtA4gene was successful. Interestingly, some sequences exhibited a TM-score of 0.73 with the reference but lacked the identified domain.

Linear regression analysis indicated a positive relationship between genetic diversity and toxin diversity measured in Shannon’s diversity index, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.66 (p< 0.05) (Fig.6A). Additionally, the analysis revealed a positive correlation between the number of representative sequences possessed by each strain and toxin richness at 20 °C, with anR2of 0.70 (p< 0.05) (Fig.6B). Moreover, analysis of the similarity among the 20 predicted protein structures within strains revealed a negative correlation with toxin richness at 20 °C (R2= 0.62, Fig.6C). This result suggests that as toxin richness increases,Z-scores decrease, indicating greater diversity in protein structures. In this context, lowZ-scores indicate dissimilar protein structures, while highZ-scores represent structurally similar or homologous proteins.

This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the physiological intraspecific variation inA. pacificumand to advance knowledge of the relationship between genetic diversity in the saxitoxin biosynthetic gene, environmental conditions (i.e., temperature) and toxin production within the species. A limitation in previous studies ofAlexandriumspecies was the use of a limited number of strains, which may have underestimated the species’ physiological and genetic diversity. Here, eight strains ofA. pacificumwere tested under the same temperature conditions, revealing distinct growth patterns that allowed classification into two groups. KM strains, which were isolated as vegetative cells from the water column in May, showed robust growth at 15 °C, indicating adaptation to low temperatures. In contrast, LIMS strains, which were isolated as cysts from sediment in October, exhibited little growth, suggesting physiological stress. This likely reflects their lower tolerance to cold stress and may indicate that they had entered a dormant phase in response to seasonal cooling. These findings highlight the importance of using multiple strains to capture intraspecific variability, which is essential for understanding the ecological success and environmental adaptability ofAlexandriumspecies.

Alexandriumspecies are generally recognized for increased toxin production at lower temperatures (8 to 17 °C) [5,23,38,57,69,93]. Additionally, cold stress has been shown to elevate toxin production and enhance the expression of the saxitoxin biosynthetic genes,sxtAandsxtG, inA. pacificum[52,93]. However, the high toxin levels observed at 30 °C in this study contrast with previous reports emphasizing cold-induced toxicity. We found increased toxin production under growth-inhibiting stress conditions—not only at the elevated temperature of 30 °C across all eight strains, but also at 15 °C for two LIMS strains. This discrepancy is important because Etheridge and Roesler [26] showed that toxin production can increase when dinoflagellate growth slows, implying that cells may prioritize producing secondary metabolites over cell division. This is further evidenced by recent work from Jean et al. [47] demonstrated that whileA. pacificumgrowth decreased at 30 °C, the toxin composition shifted with increased levels of some toxins and appearance of new analogs under warming conditions. Together, these findings suggest that high-temperature stress can also enhance toxicity. Consistently, our results suggest a negative relationship between growth rate and toxin production, with slower-growing strains tending to produce higher toxin levels (Figs.1I,2E, Supplementary Fig.7). However, this inverse relationship appears to be relatively weak, indicating that other factors may also play significant roles in regulating toxin biosynthesis alongside growth rate. This potential trade-off might reflect complex resource allocation strategies withinAlexandriumstrains under varying environmental conditions [10,11,14]. These results highlight the complex relationship between temperature and toxin production, suggesting that toxin synthesis may be prioritized under stress, regardless of the expected temperature range for toxin production. In ecosystems, this can result in complex variations in PSP toxicity levels, with temporary increases occurring at both low and high temperature [57,69].

Temperature changes also influenced the profiles ofA. pacificumstrains. As temperatures increased, the Shannon index indicated a rise in toxin diversity, while the Simpson’s diversity index decreased. This suggests that while a greater diversity of toxin analogs was produced with increasing temperature, certain toxins became more dominant among the analogs. This shift was particularly evident at 30 °C, where all strains experienced growth inhibition, suggesting a potential adaptive response to thermal stress. In contrast, at 15 °C—where growth inhibition was limited to only LIMS group—both toxin diversity and analog dominance were less evident. Consistent with these findings, Jean et al. [47] observed that warming and polymetallic stress at 30 °C led to increased production of specific toxin analogs and the appearance of previously undetected toxin analogs. This aligns with our findings of increased toxin diversity and dominance patterns under thermal stress. The increase in toxin diversity and dominance observed under thermal stress may be associated with cellular energy metabolism. Cho et al. [18] reported that thesxtAenzyme co-localizes with Rubisco II and is potentially linked to chloroplasts inAlexandrium catenella, suggesting a possible relationship between saxitoxin biosynthesis and energy-dependent cellular processes. Although the exact role of saxitoxin remains uncertain, its upregulation under stress suggests it may contribute to cellular survival mechanisms under changing environmental conditions.

Despite extensive research on the environmental factors influencing toxin production inAlexandrium[1,15,39,46,57,58,75,83], Van [92,93,95], the underlying mechanisms associated with toxin production remain poorly understood. Previous studies have reported that physiological differences within the same algal species can potentially arise from intraspecific genetic differences [53,71]. Given the observed variation in toxin composition among strains under the same environmental conditions, we conducted a genetic analysis to investigate whether these differences might be attributed to genetic diversity. Therefore, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences of the saxitoxin biosyntheticsxtA4gene and found clear genetic diversity among the strains, with high intragenic variation within each strain. These findings align well with previous studies that show high intragenic diversity in this gene, containing between 100 and 378 copies [29,68,79,87]. The expression levels of the proteins produced by the diverse copies of thesxtA4gene may vary due to non-synonymous SNPs, which can alter the corresponding amino acids in the protein, potentially modifying its function or substrate affinity. These changes, in turn, can lead to differences in the composition and quantity of the final synthesized toxin analogs [17,32,35,45,78,96]. Furthermore, our findings revealed that strains with a greater number of representative sequences produced a wider range of toxin analogs—a relationship not previously reported. [29] suggested that toxin gene sequences with fewer SNPs might be associated with lower toxin diversity. This discovery highlights the crucial role of genetic diversity in shaping toxin profile ofAlexandrium. Furthermore, it offers new insights into the intraspecific variation in PSP toxin production and composition, which has puzzled researchers for decades, even among strains isolated from the same location and time. These findings advance our understanding of PSP toxin variability and provide a foundation for future research aimed at mitigating the impacts of harmful algal blooms. The observed genetic variation in thesxtA4gene could eventually support the identification of molecular markers associated with highly toxic strains. Such insights may inform the development of early-warning molecular monitoring tools to detect toxic blooms in advance, enabling more effective management strategies such as issuing timely harvesting advisories or focused monitoring efforts.

Building upon this genetic analysis, we next investigated whether the observed intragenic diversity translates into structural differences in the encoded protein, which could affect toxin production. Although there is high diversity observed in the nucleotide sequences of thesxtA4gene, we identified a highly conserved region within those sequences and translated amino acid sequences in the corresponding region. To confirm this trend, the analysis of 166sxtA4gene sequences retrieved from the NCBI database in dinoflagellates—Alexandriumspp.,Gymnodinium catenatum, andPyrodinium bahamense—also revealed that this region is highly conserved in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences (Supplementary Fig.10). In general, the conserved region in the sequences suggests that there is strong evolutionary pressure to maintain this sequence, likely due to its functional or structural importance [8,43,54,97]. Therefore, while thesxtA4gene is involved in the initial step of the saxitoxin biosynthetic pathway, and the conserved region identified in this study may contribute to maintaining essential enzymatic function, it is unlikely that variations in its primary sequence alone directly determine the diversity of downstream PST analogs. Rather, these variations may reflect functional tolerance within the conserved core, allowing STX biosynthesis to proceed despite sequence divergence. Hence, the observed sequence diversity likely underscores the robustness of this core function, rather than directly shaping the final toxin profile [28,74,86].

The predicted structural variation observed among strains may reflect functional consequences ofsxtA4gene diversity. Although the enzymatic role of thesxtA4-encoded protein in saxitoxin biosynthesis is recognized, its precise structure–function relationship remains unresolved [33,87]. By assessing the predicted 3D structures, we aimed to explore whether intragenic diversity could be associated with differences in predicted protein structure, and whether these structural differences might tentatively relate to observed toxin analog profiles. The structural differences inferred across strains—particularly in the presence or absence of key functional domains—which could in turn be loosely associated with differences in catalytic behavior. Interestingly, strains with greater diversity in predicted protein structures tended to produce a broader range of toxin analogs, suggesting a possible correlation between structural variation and toxin production (Fig.6C). While causality cannot be established from these observations alone, they may reflect strain-specific adaptations in toxin biosynthesis machinery, potentially shaped by ecological or evolutionary pressures. Moreover, comparison of the known structure of arginine aminotransferase (PDB ID: 6KFR) with the predicted protein structure from this study revealed a TM-score of approximately 0.7 out of 1.0. This high similarity between the two is notable, as the observed structural resemblance to known aminotransferases supports the hypothesis that the amplifiedsxtA4regions encode functionally relevant proteins. These findings underscore the potential utility of structural bioinformatics in bridging genotypic diversity and phenotypic outcomes in toxic dinoflagellates, though further functional validation will be essential.

Although this study suggests a potential link between sequence variation in thesxtA4gene and the production of different saxitoxin analogs, this interpretation should be approached with caution. WhilesxtA4plays a key role in initiating the biosynthetic pathway, the structural diversity of PST analogs is likely shaped by downstream tailoring enzymes such assxtSUL,sxtX,sxtH, andsxtU, whose activities may vary under different environmental or physiological conditions [19,20,33,67,87] As such, the observed association betweensxtA4sequence divergence and toxin profiles remains uncertain and cannot be conclusively interpreted as causal. A major limitation of this study is that it focuses solely onsxtA4, without considering potential interactions with other genes involved in the pathway. To fully understand the mechanisms driving the production of specific saxitoxin analogs, future research must examine howsxtA4interacts with other biosynthetic genes. A more comprehensive understanding of these gene–gene interactions is essential to unravel the complexity of saxitoxin biosynthesis.

Building on the key findings of this study, several important insights have emerged regarding the ecological significance of toxin production dynamics inAlexandrium. First, the pronounced intraspecific variability in growth patterns and toxin production among differentA. pacificumstrains underscores the species’ adaptive complexity, which may influence bloom dynamics and associated ecosystem effects. This highlights the ecological importance of intraspecific diversity in shaping toxin production and suggests that analyzing a broader range of isolates from diverse environments could deepen our understanding of how such diversity contributes to bloom formation and persistence. Furthermore, our results suggest thatAlexandriumtends to prioritize toxin production under stressful conditions, such as growth-inhibiting temperatures. This response may represent a survival strategy in which energy is redirected from growth toward toxin synthesis, helping cells cope with environmental stress. Such a shift could, in turn, affect ecological interactions and ecosystem functioning. Notably, the genetic diversity observed in thesxtA4gene, especially in relation to toxin composition, indicates that the ecological impacts ofAlexandriumare diverse and multifaceted. This genetic variation plays a crucial role in shaping how those impacts manifest. Genomic and transcriptomic approaches could offer deeper insights into how variations across multiple genes involved in saxitoxin biosynthesis contribute to differences in toxin analog composition, thereby influencing food web dynamics and toxicity risks. The presence of conserved regions within thesxtA4gene suggests the action of evolutionary pressures essential for maintaining saxitoxin biosynthesis. This may be important for the long-term persistence and ecological role ofAlexandriumin marine ecosystems. In conclusion, while this study provides valuable insights into the interplay among genetic diversity, toxin production, and environmental stress, it also emphasizes the broader ecological implications of these dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is essential for improving the prediction, management, and mitigation of harmful algal blooms, which pose increasing threats to marine ecosystems and human health in a changing climate.
