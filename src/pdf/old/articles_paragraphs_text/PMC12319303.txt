Nutritional requirements and food systems for long‐duration space missions are crucial to crew safety and mission success, just as the spacecraft's mechanical systems are (Douglas et al.2020). Despite advancements since the launch of the International Space Station (ISS) in 1998, it remains unclear why space travelers consistently consume only about 80% of their daily energy needs (Smith et al.2005). In the second edition ofHuman Adaptation in Spaceflight: The Role of Food and Nutrition(Smith et al.2020) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), microgravity, radiation, isolation and confinement, environmental, and time factors are identified as key stressors impacting crew nutritional requirements. Balanced nutrition and healthy eating behavior are essential for counteracting these stressors and maintaining optimal human functioning during space missions (Bergouignan et al.2016; Cena et al.2003; Heer et al.2000; Pandith et al.2023; Pittia et al.2023; Smith et al.2021). Despite significant improvements in the space food system over the past 50 years, which have enhanced meal palatability for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) crews, these advancements fall short for long‐duration missions, such as the proposed 3‐year journey to Mars (Vodovotz et al.2000). The challenges of preventing weight loss and ensuring adequate nutrition on these extended missions present serious challenges to both physical and psychological well‐being.

The importance of food in space extends far beyond meeting basic energy requirements (Cooper et al.2011); it becomes a crucial source of psychological comfort and gratification, especially on prolonged missions where other forms of personal satisfaction are limited. As reported in Stuster's (2016) analysis of theJournalsexperiment, which documented astronauts’ daily experiences aboard the ISS, food consistently emerged as a primary subject of interest and discussion. Stuster (2016) noted that “food assumes added importance when access to friends, family, leisure pursuits and other normal sources of gratification are denied,” emphasizing that food's role in maintaining morale is similarly observed in other isolated and confined environments such as oil rigs, Antarctic research stations, and submarines. Thus, understanding eating behavior in such settings requires more than addressing physiological needs—it demands an exploration of the broader social and psychological roles food plays.

The space environment may significantly alter flavor perception and food palatability, which can, in turn, impact nutritional well‐being (Taylor et al.2021; Taylor et al.2020). Beyond the obvious reduction in gravity, the spacecraft environment is highly confined and cluttered, presenting unique eating challenges. Taylor and colleagues (2020) highlighted numerous internal and external factors within the spacecraft that could influence flavor perception (e.g., water quality, eating environment, stress). Flavor perception itself is inherently multisensory, involving the integration of taste, smell, texture, and trigeminal sensations. These sensory inputs integrate within the individual and are further influenced by the external environment (Holthuysen et al.2017; Low et al.2024; Schouteten et al.2024; Spence et al.2019; Wang et al.2019), creating a unique perceptual experience for each person and every eating occasion. The five basic senses—touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing—work together to form a multisensory perception of food, contributing significantly to eating enjoyment (Newman et al.2023; Zampini and Spence2010). Consequently, any disruption to one of these senses, such as reduced smell sensitivity in microgravity, as well as food presentation and consumption methods, may dramatically alter the perception and acceptance of food, highlighting the need for sensory adaptive food systems that can accommodate such environmental effects.

This narrative review based on a structured literature search strategy examines flavor perception research within spaceflight missions and Earth‐based analogs, aiming to explore how these platforms can contribute to understanding food sensory experiences in space. Throughout this review, we use the currently accepted definitions ofsimulated microgravityto refer to tools such as clinostats and random positioning machines, andmicrogravity analogsto refer to human‐rated methods such as head‐down bed rest and dry immersion (Ferranti et al.2020; Oluwafemi and Neduncheran2022). We also includemicrogravity platformslike parabolic flights and orbital missions, which provide actual microgravity exposure. Table1summarizes the differences utilizing definitions provided by Ferranti et al. (2020) and Oluwafemi and Neduncheran (2022). In addition, this review considersisolation and confinement analogsthat simulate the psychological and operational stressors of spaceflight, anddigital simulationswhich replicate the environmental context of space without mimicking gravitational effects.

While recent reviews have addressed space analogs in life sciences broadly (Oluwafemi and Neduncheran2022), their specific application to flavor perception remains underexplored. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively examine methods and tools used to assess flavor perception specifically in space missions (Section3). By exploring this information, we aim to identify any consistent changes in flavor perception during space missions, which could inform future research in prolonged, confined environments. In this review, flavor perception is defined as the interaction between the five core human senses—taste, smell (including orthonasal and retronasal olfaction), sight (color, visual texture), sound, and touch—and trigeminal senses (Zampini and Spence2010; Figure1adapted from Newman et al. [2023]). The second part of the review focuses on identifying the available space analogs and simulation methodologies used in space life science studies, with a particular emphasis on their applicability for studying flavor perception and eating experience (Section4). This includes a discussion of the relative merits (limitations and benefits) of key methodologies and research gaps. Recommendations and conclusive remarks were summarized in Section5. The background context of current space travel conditions, including the challenges associated with physiological changes during space travel, is provided inSupporting Information A. A narrative review approach was selected, supported by a structured literature search strategy, to map the current range of space analogs and simulations applicable to flavor perception research. This methodology allows for a broader examination of existing methods, helping to highlight gaps in knowledge and identify tools that could be adapted for studying sensory experiences in space.

Studies involving the indirect sensory evaluation of food such as eating behavior in space analogs and simulations (e.g., human cognitive performance related to food, ingestive behavior such as food cravings). These studies provide insight into the applicability of analog methods to flavor perception.

Two independent literature searches were conducted in June 2023, with slight modifications to keywords to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies. Additional screenings were performed in March 2024 and August 2024 to include any newly published studies. The search used the following keywords in various combinations: “space,” “food*,” “sensory,” “microgravity,” “spaceflight OR space flight,” “taste,” “smell,” “flavour OR flavor,” “chemosensory,” “perception,” “analog*,” “simulation,” “isolat*,” and “confine*.” Additional articles were identified through full‐text reviews of citations and searches based on first author names. A schematic representation of the search strategy can be found in Figure2. A total of 45 articles were identified.

Specific keyword combinations included “space,” “food*,” “sensory,” “microgravity,” “spaceflight OR space flight,” “taste,” “smell,” “flavour OR flavor,” “chemosensory,” “perception,” “analog*,” “simulation,” “isolat*,” and “confine*.” Specific keyword combinations included (Space OR spaceflight OR space flight OR microgravity) AND food*; (Space OR spaceflight OR space flight OR microgravity) AND (taste OR smell OR flavour OR flavor); (Space OR spaceflight OR space flight OR microgravity) AND (chemosensory OR perception); Space AND (analog* OR simulation) AND food*; Space AND (analog* OR simulation) AND (taste OR smell OR flavour OR flavor); Space AND (analog* OR simulation) AND (chemosensory OR perception); and Space AND (analog* OR simulation) AND (isolat* OR confine*).

A total of 16 articles were identified that explored how spaceflight conditions affect flavor perception. These included four quantitative studies and 12 qualitative observations captured during space missions. While quantitative data collection on sensory perception related to space conditions was primarily conducted in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., Soyuz 30–31 missions, Skylab 4, and STS‐41‐G), no such studies have been conducted aboard the ISS, with available data limited to qualitative reports. This highlights the challenge in evaluating the long‐term impact of space conditions on flavor perception. This persistent absence of in‐flight quantitative research not only limits understanding of how flavor perception evolves under space conditions but also hinders the development of evidence‐based countermeasures for future long‐duration missions. Given the central role of food in sustaining both nutrition and psychological well‐being, the lack of robust sensory data represents a critical gap that future space programs must prioritize through controlled, space‐compatible sensory evaluations. While this section focuses on summarizing current findings, the authors recommend that future studies employ standardized, space‐compatible psychophysical methods and repeated‐measure designs to systematically track flavor perception changes over time. Broader recommendations and methodological considerations are further discussed in Section4.

This section presents results and discussion in two parts: (1) subjective experiences of flavor perception during spaceflight (Section3.1) and (2) quantitative data on flavor perception in spaceflight studies (Section3.2). Collectively, the discussion below offers insights into sensory adjustments to space environments and reveals behavioral adaptation among astronauts to maintain food pleasure.

The effects of space conditions on flavor perception experienced by crew members are summarized in Table2and divided into three key themes: changes in sensory perception; behavioral strategies for enhancing food enjoyment; and appetite and cravings. Each theme highlights potential sensory changes and adaptive eating behaviors, suggesting avenues for improving food experiences in space. The studies published between 1963 and 2020 primarily relied on astronaut debriefs, mission logs, and informal interviews.

Subjective experiences related to flavor perception during spaceflights categorized by themes.

Crewmembers added spices to their food supply to enhance flavor.

Reduced taste perception, potentially due to monotony, and tested condiments to improve palatability.

Perceived less taste in foods while in orbit than on the ground. This was thought to be due to the monotony of the diet rather than a physiological change.

Dietary preference for higher carbohydrates in relation to fat.

Use of spices and condiments increases the palatability.

Altered food tastes with a preference for salty foods.

Dietary preference for higher carbohydrates in relation to fat.

Crewmembers experienced cravings for apricot juice, honey, and more spicy and pungent condiments such as mustard and horseradish.

Dietary preference for higher carbohydrates in relation to fat.

Some foods tasted bland, leading to the frequent use of condiments like Tabasco sauce.

Taste changes and cultural differences in preferred foods sometimes led to reduced appetite or skipped meals.

Crewmembers from both Soviet and American missions (Baranski et al.1983; Campton and Benson1983; Douglas et al.2016; Perchonok and Bourland2002; Rambaut et al.1977) reported changes in taste perception during space missions, often describing food as bland or unappetizing. Notably, the Salyut 6 crew reported an unusually salty perception of canned ham (Oberg1981). This observation might be attributed to nasal congestion due to fluid shifts in microgravity, which reduces the complexity of flavor profiles (Flores2008), leaving only the salty taste of the meat more pronounced. Such findings indicate that space conditions may amplify or reduce specific flavor elements, which could vary based on individual taste sensitivity (Dias et al.2013; Hayes et al.2010; Pilic et al.2020). This emphasizes the need for personalized food approaches. Based on the evidence available, fluid shifts associated with microgravity likely lead to nasal congestion, which dulls sensory perception during short‐term missions (Baranski et al.1983; Smith et al.2021). However, longer missions may involve complex adjustments to fluid shifts, suggesting that nasal congestion alone may not fully explain the reduced flavor perception experienced over time (Smith et al.2021; Taylor et al.2019; Taylor et al.2020). Furthermore, research on microgravity simulations indicates potential adaptation over time (Antonutto and Di Prampero2003; Baker et al.2019; Iwase et al.2020), though individual variability in fluid adjustment necessitates further study to optimize personalized food presentation and palatability in space environments (Costa et al.2021). These individual differences warrant further investigation to understand how flavor perception may vary across space travelers.

To counteract reduced flavor perception, space travelers employ behavioral strategies. For example, crewmembers aboard the Skylab and Salyut 6 missions added spices and pungent condiments like mustard and horseradish to their meals (Johnston and Dietlein1977; Kerwin and Seddon2002; Oberg1981; Rambaut et al.1977). These additions likely stimulate trigeminal sensations, compensating for sensory dullness in space and highlighting the importance of incorporating strong flavors in space menus to support food enjoyment (Brand2006). While pungent condiments were added to reflect a compensatory response to the diminished flavor perception, it remains unclear whether trigeminal compounds are perceived differently in space. More recent studies suggest that trigeminal‐stimulating compounds, such as the burning sensation caused by small amounts of capsaicin, can influence the perceived thickness of soups regardless of habitual chili pepper intake (Lyu et al.2021). Designing foods with optimized levels of pungency or astringency could serve as a functional sensory cue, maintaining interest and variety in repetitive menus (He et al.2023; Pires et al.2020; Reinbach et al.2010). Incorporating such stimuli at controlled levels could enhance perceptual contrast without causing discomfort, thereby sustaining sensory interest and palatability, especially in repetitive menus. Personalized condiment kits and sensory trials conducted in space analogs and simulations may further refine these interventions, enabling more tailored and effective flavor delivery systems. Together, understanding how trigeminal simulating compounds are perceived in microgravity could provide strategies for improving the texture and palatability of food in space.

Table3summarizes the findings from studies examining flavor perception changes during spaceflights. To date, only four known sensory functionality experiments (published between 1975 and 1985) have been conducted with space travelers as participants (Baranski et al.1979; Baranski et al.1983; Heidelbaugh et al.1975; Watt et al.1985). These limited studies underscore the scarcity of systematic sensory research in space, as no additional published studies beyond these have specifically focused on flavor perception in space missions (Olabi et al.2002).

Spaceflight flavor perception experiments with quantitative data.

Electrogustometry was used to measure taste detection thresholds by applying a direct current of increasing intensity to the tongue at different areas. The point at which the subject reported a slight sensation was considered indicative of the taste detection threshold (Tomita and Ikeda2002).

Importantly, these experiments primarily assessed basic sensory functionalities, such as detection and recognition thresholds, rather than affective responses (e.g., hedonic ratings), which limits our understanding of astronauts’ subjective food enjoyment. This focus aligns with the initial objectives of these studies, which aimed to determine whether taste and smell perception changed before, during, and after spaceflight. Notably, three out of four experiments provided more details in their experiments; however, details from the Polish Soyuz missions (Baranski et al.1979) remain unclear, limiting the interpretation of these results.

One key difference between the experiments is the range of psychophysical methods used to assess taste thresholds, with each method offering distinct strengths and weaknesses. For instance, taste thresholds refer to detection thresholds (the lowest concentration at which a stimulus can be detected) and recognition thresholds (the concentration at which the taste quality of the sample becomes apparent) (Amerine et al.2013; Keast and Roper2007; Low et al.2017; Snyder et al.2006). The Soyuz missions employed electrogustometry (Baranski et al.1979), Skylab 4 used flavor paper strips (Heidelbaugh et al.1975), and Space Shuttle Mission STS‐41‐G employed taste solutions (Watt et al.1985). While these variations were likely due to adaptations required for spaceflight, they also complicate direct comparisons of findings and may have contributed to inconsistent results, as each method inherently differs in sensitivity, reliability, and dimensions measured (Lawless and Heymann2010; Meilgaard et al.1999).

A particular issue in some studies, such as STS‐41‐G, was a lack of clarity in their methodology for determining taste recognition thresholds, raising concerns about reliability (Olabi et al.2002). For example, details on the concentration intervals used to assess taste recognition were omitted. The Soyuz missions’ choice of electrogustometry likely aimed to circumvent fluid (taste solution) behavior issues in weightlessness, but this method may also capture trigeminal responses, contributing to variability among individuals due to the diverse sensitivity of receptors (Bartoshuk and Snyder2016; Olabi et al.2002; Pavlidis et al.2021). More recent studies on individual variation in thermal sensations using rods have also found large differences across individuals due to physiological differences in taste receptors and trigeminal nerves (Botha et al.2021), which may partly explain the inconsistencies in earlier spaceflight studies.

Importantly, a key commonality across these four experiments is the consistent finding that space conditions do not appear to affect smell functionality. However, the data on taste perception changes are conflicting, with some studies indicating changes in taste sensitivity, while others do not. These inconsistencies may be attributed to the large variability among individuals, as previously observed in Earth‐based sensory trials (Cicerale et al.2012; De Toffoli et al.2019; Hayes and Duffy2007; Kato and Roth2012; Lim et al.2008; Low et al.2016,2017; Mora et al.2018; Samant and Seo2019; Webb et al.2015), since psychophysical studies typically include a minimum of 30 participants to achieve reliable results (Fields2013). In cases with fewer participants, studies often involve multiple rigorous testing sessions to ensure repeatability (Keast et al.2003), which is understandably difficult to do during space missions.

Additionally, advances in taste and smell psychophysics since the 1980s—including improved scaling for taste intensity (Bartoshuk and Snyder2016; Green et al.1996) and reliable odor discriminatory tests, such as “Sniffin’ Sticks,” with high test–retest reliability scores of 0.7–0.9 (Hummel et al.1997; Oleszkiewicz et al.2019)—highlight limitations in these early spaceflight experiments. Standardizing experimental methods in future space missions would allow data from multiple missions to be compiled and analyzed collectively, accounting for individual variability. Taylor and colleagues (2020) also emphasized the need for standardized, easy‐to‐use methods in future spaceflight studies.

Given these challenges, the authors recommend that future studies should adopt standardized psychophysical protocols that are both spaceflight compatible and capable of producing reliable, comparable data. Based on our evaluation of prior studies, solid‐phase taste delivery systems, such as filter paper taste strips or compressed tablets with predefined concentrations, would offer a practical solution. This could eliminate the need for fluid handling while enabling systematic and replicable threshold assessments. Alternatively, taste solutions may also be suitable, provided they are in secure, single‐use modes such as sealed blister packs or pouches that allow controlled release and prevent the risks associated with free‐floating liquids in microgravity. The authors emphasize that the choice of delivery method should balance methodological rigor with operational feasibility to improve the consistency and comparability of sensory data collected in space.

Although initial space missions did not report significant changes in taste and smell sensitivity, anecdotal reports from astronauts describe a diminished appetite potentially linked to altered taste and smell sensations (Heer et al.2007). Furthermore, on Earth studies, there is emerging evidence suggesting a coordinated bodily response to nutrients in food between the oral taste receptors in the oral cavity with the receptors located throughout the gastrointestinal tract (Heini et al.1998; Little and Feinle‐Bisset2010;Newman et al.2013). This highlights a need for simplified, yet realistic, sensory tests in future missions—such as those outlined in the International Standards Organisation (ISO) Method for Investigating Sensitivity to Taste (ISO1991) or Webb et al.’s (2015) adapted suprathreshold procedure—that could better align studies conducted on Earth with sensory data from space missions.

An additional factor to consider in future research is the effect of mission length and the intervals between data collection points on sensory changes. For example, Skylab 4 missions lasted 84 days, observed a decline in taste sensitivity over time, particularly for certain flavors (Heidelbaugh et al.1975), whereas the STS‐41‐G shuttle mission, which lasted only 8 days, showed no significant differences in taste perception (Watt et al.1985). These differences may indicate that duration and compound specificity could play roles in sensory alterations, potentially influenced by stress, space sickness, radiation exposure, or sensory deprivation in confined environments (Olabi et al.2002; Taylor et al.2020). A recent Virtual Reality (VR) study simulating a confined space environment similarly reported a large variation in odor intensity perception, suggesting that environmental confinement itself may influence chemosensory perception (discussed in Section4) (Loke, Chand, et al.2024).

Despite decades of spaceflight, no sensory experiments have been conducted aboard the ISS, and existing studies remain methodologically limited. In our review, most studies focused on threshold type (detection, recognition) methods, often lacking consistent methodologies and affective measures to fully understand interactions with food enjoyment. Small sample sizes, high interindividual variability in sensory sensitivity, and inconsistent testing protocols underscore the need for standardized, scalable psychophysical methods. Although the small sample sizes in these studies limit the broader generalizability of findings, the authors acknowledge that such constraints are inherent in space‐related research, where participant numbers are naturally limited to a highly selective and constrained astronaut population. Further, methods should be tested across ground‐based analogs to ensure robustness under space‐relevant stressors. For instance, food samples may be administered through sealed delivery systems compatible with the ISS environment. Sensory responses could be assessed using either hedonic methods to evaluate liking and acceptability or descriptive methods to characterize flavor intensity and quality. Depending on the research aim, appropriate scale formats such as hedonic scales for liking or magnitude estimation scales for intensity should be selected. Data collection should be optimized using portable or digital entry systems that minimize equipment burden and allow standardized input in confined or resource‐limited environments. We also observe that mission duration and compound‐specific factors likely influence sensory responses, reinforcing the importance of tailoring sensory evaluation methods to different spaceflight stressors. For example, studies may stratify participants based on pre‐flight sensory sensitivity or use crossover designs to track intraindividual shifts across mission phases. Moreover, most studies capture only single time‐point data, limiting insight into the progressive nature of sensory adaptation over the course of a mission. While early reports suggest that fluid shifts and nasal congestion contribute to altered taste and smell, we propose that long‐duration missions may introduce additional physiological and psychological factors that further affect flavor perception. In particular, the distinction between early‐phase changes linked to fluid shifts and later‐phase adaptations associated with sustained microgravity remains poorly understood. We recommend that future research prioritize the development of standardized psychophysical testing protocols that incorporate suprathreshold intensity measures and repeated‐measures designs, alongside the use of analog and simulation‐based missions (as discussed below), to enable meaningful comparisons across different mission types and experimental contexts. These analog environments should serve as iterative testing grounds where methodological adjustments, such as delivery method, exposure timing, and participant comfort, are refined before potential implementation in true microgravity. However, we emphasize that this review aims to provide methodological direction rather than fixed testing protocols. The precise combination of tools, measures, and schedules will depend on specific research aims, hardware constraints, and the operational feasibility in spaceflight. These approaches will better capture mission‐relevant sensory changes and support the development of effective flavor‐based countermeasures to enhance astronaut nutrition and well‐being.

A total of 29 articles were identified as space analogs (n= 23) and simulation methods (n= 6) for sensory perception‐related studies. These methods are summarized inSupporting Information B, which includes their suitability for flavor perception studies. The applicability was judged based on participants’ ability to taste and rate sensory stimuli (e.g., tastants and odors).

Stacks highlight specific methods such as head down tilt (HDT) and microgravity posture as microgravity analogs; isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) and isolated, confined, and controlled (ICC) environments as isolated and confinement analogs; and video and Virtual Reality (VR) simulations as space simulations. The number of articles and publication years are also included.

Of the 23 identified space analog studies, two types were identified: isolation and confinement analogs (n= 12) and physiological analogs that mimic physiological adaptation process to microgravity (n= 11). Additionally, space agency‐related analogs were reviewed and classified, with details summarized in TablesS2andS3.

Isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments: Remote and extreme locations focusing on field research and training exercises (Cromwell et al.2021).

Isolated, confined, and controlled (ICC) environments: Controlled conditions focusing on controlled research studies to examine the effects of isolation (Cromwell et al.2021).

TableS2summarizes details of each analog's environment and study areas. It is noted that these analogs have not focused specifically on flavor perception, but they could potentially be used for future sensory studies. Examples of methods include Arctic and Antarctic missions, Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), and facilities such as HERA (NASA), NEK (IBMP, Russia), HESITA (DLR, Germany), and CHAPEA (NASA).

Table4summarizes the findings from studies on flavor perception and sensory changes in ICE environments. While flavor‐specific studies remain limited, studies have highlighted that environmental stressors, psychological adaptation, and the effects of isolation can influence chemosensory perceptions, appetite, and enjoyment of food. For instance, behavioral data from these missions primarily address the effects of extended confinement and sensory monotony (Basner et al.2014; Bell et al.2019; Kahn and Leon1994; Kanas et al.2011; Le Roy et al.2023; Marques‐Quinteiro et al.2023; Palinkas and Suedfeld2008; Tafforin et al.2015; Van Fossen et al.2021). Such sensory deprivation may occur due to physical constraints or limited food variety (Bachman et al.2012; Stuster2016). For example, astronauts reported that food lacks the same taste as it does on Earth (“it's tough to get enough food in the belly because it doesn't taste good as it does at home” [Stuster2016]). While such data are valuable, they underscore a recurring gap: the limited quantitative assessment of sensory thresholds and taste quality changes over time to clarify the extent and mechanisms of these perceptual changes. Bridging this gap will require integrating validated sensory metrics into mission designs, even within resource‐constrained analog environments.

During the Mars 500 mission, prolonged confinement and a monotonous diet were shown to reduce appetite and affect psychological well‐being (Šolcová et al.2016; Ushakov et al.2014). Further, Hunter et al. (2011) found that instant meals contributed to food monotony, while custom‐prepared meals with diverse flavors, appearances, and aromas increased satisfaction and food intake on designated cooking days. The effect of varied flavors on alleviating sensory monotony could be a critical area for future studies. Similarly, Rai and Kaur (2012) observed that physical and mental workloads decreased taste sensitivity (sweet taste), particularly during physically demanding tasks, pointing to a gap in research around complex flavors and psychological resilience. In comparison to other taste qualities, the sweet taste quality consistently yielded the highest identification rates throughout the trial. Notably, a significant decrease in cumulative salty taste scores was observed over the course of the Antarctic stay, returning to baseline levels at the end of the trial. These findings suggest that certain taste qualities may be more sensitive to isolation and stress than others. Future research should aim to systematically investigate how different taste qualities are affected under such conditions, using standardized stimuli and blinded protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.

Antarctic winter‐over missions provide additional evidence suggesting that altered chemosensory experience is more attributable to prolonged stays in extreme environments than to sensory acuity loss (Barabasz and Gregson1979; Gregson1978). Although changes in taste perception over extended stays remain uncertain, studies have found stable sweet and sour taste perception during winter‐over, with slight improvements in taste sensitivity post‐isolation (Gregson1978). These findings contrast with subjective observations from Mars 500, where preference for sweets declined (Agureev et al.2017). Another recent 1‐year study at Concordia Station in Antarctica (n= 19) observed a general decline in olfactory function and an increase in hyposmia over the course of the expedition. Gustatory function remained largely stable, though sensitivity to salty tastes diminished during isolation. These findings suggest that the combined effects of isolation, confinement, and hypoxia may contribute to progressive sensory changes, potentially influencing dietary habits, energy intake, and body weight (Klos et al.2024).

Behavioral health measures included the Profile of Mood States—Short Form (POMS‐SF) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).

Flavor perception research in space analog environments remains significantly constrained by several methodological and conceptual limitations. Based on the authors’ evaluation of the current literature, a primary challenge is the limited focus on sensory studies within these settings. While gustatory changes have been occasionally explored, flavor perception is often treated as a secondary consideration. As a result, the available research lacks both depth and consistency.

In the authors’ view, analog environments such as Antarctic overwintering missions and the MDRS offer valuable and currently underutilized opportunities to examine the effects of isolation on human perception. Expanding sensory studies in these settings could address existing gaps and provide more robust insights into how isolation impacts flavor perception.

Physiological analogs simulate physiological adaptation process as in microgravity but do not fully replicate space conditions (Cromwell et al.2021; Ferranti et al.2020; Oluwafemi and Neduncheran2022). In life sciences, various analogs have been utilized to mimic the effects of microgravity (seeSupporting Information B). TableS3provides a summary of facilities offering physiological analogs. Of note, these are government‐based facilities, and known private sectors are also offering these facilities for research (but no published studies have been found so far). Notably, most recent published studies identified two approaches to simulate small components of microgravity in conducting sensory‐related studies. This includes the microgravity position (simulated body fluid movements that occur during microgravity) and microgravity postures (simulated posture of space travelers during microgravity).

Table6summarizes flavor perception experiments conducted in physiological analog for microgravity position, designed to simulate the physiological effect of body fluid shift. Generally, bed rest and dry immersion analogs induce microgravity‐like effects on the body (Ferranti et al.2020; Hargens and Vico2016; Navasiolava et al.2011; Tomilovskaya et al.2019), while parabolic flights provide alternating phases of hypergravity (1.8–2 g) and brief periods of true microgravity (∼20 s) (Ogoh et al.2018; Shelhamer2016). To date, flavor perception studies have only been conducted using bed rest as a physiological analog for microgravity position. These experiments were comprehensively reviewed by Olabi et al. (2002), and since then, only four additional published studies (Cromwell et al.2018; Gonzalez Viejo, Harris, and Fuentes2024; Loke, Chandrapala, et al.2024; Low and Loke2024; Rai2009) have been identified to investigate the use of these analogs concerning flavor perception. The key findings from these studies are discussed below to evaluate how these analogs have been applied to flavor perception and eating experience research.

Increased taste thresholds for sweet, salt, acidic, and bitter.

n= 62; electrogustometry before and after food intake.

Taste thresholds increased significantly during the AOH period but tended to normalize by the fifth day.

AOH induces alterations in taste sensitivity, characterized by increased thresholds and changes in the gastrolingual reflex.

Functional mobility method is a process that determines the physiological ability of the body to adapt by weakening or strengthening system functions through the reduction or increase in the number of active functional units (Sniakin1971).

Electrogustometry was used to measure taste detection thresholds by applying a direct current of increasing intensity to the tongue at different areas. The point at which the subject reported a slight sensation was considered indicative of the taste detection threshold (Tomita and Ikeda2002).

Generally, studies reveal diverse methodological approaches in sensory psychophysics. Both Vickers et al. (2001) and Rai (2009) conducted experiments using sensory setups with small dilution steps and repeated measures to examine changes during −6° HDT bed rest periods. Specifically, Vickers et al. (2001) conducted a 15‐day HDT bed rest study with a dilution series for tastants and odorants, covering basic tastes like sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, quinine, and monosodium glutamate (MSG), alongside capsaicin (trigeminal stimuli) and odorants (iso‐amyl butyrate, menthone). The same samples were used by Rai (2009) for a shorter study of 12 h measuring thresholds but with unspecific methodologies (see Table5). Both studies reported an increase in MSG thresholds, indicating a decline in sensitivity to umami, with Rai (2009) additionally noting heightened capsaicin thresholds and reduced sodium thresholds, suggesting variable effects across taste modalities under HDT conditions. While these findings are promising, limitations due to small sample sizes (range from six to 10) and variation in experimental duration present challenges in forming hypotheses. Notably, aligning multiple bed rest studies may enhance sample power and reliability, offering a pathway for investigating sustained fluid shift impacts on flavor.

Interestingly, studies led by Volozhin et al. (1974), Kurliandskii et al. (1974), Yakovleva (1981), and Budylina et al. (1976) focused on the impact of simulated weightlessness on taste receptors on the tongue. These studies revealed varied effects, with Kurliandskii et al. (1974) and Yakovleva (1981) reporting reduced taste sensitivity, supporting the general trend of reduced sensitivity under prolonged bed rest, a pattern also noted in studies of physical inactivity (Bortz II1984). In contrast, Budylina et al. (1976) observed an increased sensitivity with phased receptor activation in highly antiorthostatic conditions and reduced sensitivity and increased receptor activity in low tilts. Further, Kanda et al. (1993) found no significant difference in taste sensitivity between upright and HDT and consistent food acceptability across gravitational conditions. A more comprehensive review of these findings is available in Olabi et al. (2002)​, which underscores the need for longitudinal studies to determine the persistence of sensory changes under HDT​.

Further evidence of sensory decline under HDT conditions was found by Enck et al. (2014) in a 5‐day −6° HDT bed rest study (n= 8), which assessed olfactory function for odor threshold using phenyl ethyl alcohol in a series of dilutions, discrimination, and identification using 16 common odors, such as peppermint and vanilla. Results showed a significant reduction in olfactory sensitivity mainly due to impaired odor discrimination. Notably, a high‐sodium diet further reduced discrimination ability, suggesting an interaction between salt intake and olfactory function under HDT conditions. Moreover, one of the most comprehensive studies so far was a 70‐day NASA HDT bed rest study (n= 16), which assessed the influence of exercise on olfactory function, dividing participants into high‐ and low‐exercise groups (Cromwell et al.2018). The study employed a thorough sensory assessment (Table5), including a validated scratch‐and‐sniff test with 40 odorants (both food and nonfood), measured pre‐HDT, during HDT, and post‐HDT, alongside an odor identification test involving food‐related smells. Interestingly, the low‐exercise group showed a significant decline in smell identification during the bed rest period, while the high‐exercise group maintained stable olfactory performance. Additionally, odor identification varied, with some food‐related odors being identified more easily than others. The findings could be supported by more recent exercise studies (Gauthier et al.2023; Gauthier et al.2020; Namiranian et al.2024), where physical activity status was positively associated with chemosensory performance, underscoring exercise as a potential countermeasure to sensory decline in prolonged inactivity. This suggests the need for future research into the role of external factors like exercise (particularly the length equivalent in microgravity conditions) in aiding long‐term sensory functionality and flavor sensitivity maintenance during longer term missions.

Apart from HDT bed rest, microgravity chairs simulate specific postural conditions associated with space travel in 1g (0°–170°; NASA neutral posture during microgravity), although they lack fluid redistribution effects typically found in HDT. The method does not require specialized equipment as they have been commercialized to backyard/massage chair products that are easily accessible (NASA's spin‐off product of microgravity postures based on Skylab missions) (NASA1997,2013). Table7summarizes the findings of these studies. Of highlight, Gonzalez Viejo, Harris, and Fuentes (2024) are the first to assess basic tastes, aromas, and mouthfeel using microgravity chairs alone. This study was assessed with 14 trained panelists in three seating positions: normal (90°–270°), semireclined (55°–135°), and “microgravity” postures (0°–170°). Results indicated that tastes were perceived with higher intensity in microgravity postures, while aroma perception decreased, suggesting a modality‐specific response to postural changes. Mouthfeel intensity showed no significant differences as well. These findings may be attributed to chance due to the small sample size.

NASA neutral posture mimics “microgravity” posture using a commercial “zero‐gravity” outdoor chair set at 122°–124° (Low and Loke2024).

While trained panelists provided a controlled starting point for sensory testing, it may limit the generalizability of the results, as astronauts and general populations are not typically trained sensory assessors known for their heightened sensory acuity. Additionally, the study's inclusion of trained panelists’ emotional and physiological responses introduces complexity. Such measures are less common in trained panel type study, as affective evaluations—being subjective and based on personal differences—may be influenced by biases from training and repeated exposure to stimuli (Lawless and Heymann2010). Although this study provides valuable insights into posture‐related sensory changes, its applicability to space missions requires careful consideration. Although trained panelists’ procedural familiarity minimizes extraneous variability, they are more reliable for detecting posture effects. However, the emotional and physiological responses may not reflect those of astronauts as they typically lack the trained sensory sensitivity of panelists, limiting the relevance of such measures to real‐world space environments. Nonetheless, the exploration of posture‐related sensory variations provides a foundation for understanding how microgravity postures could impact sensory perception and inform the design of foods and environments in follow‐up studies by the team.

In another recent study, Loke, Chandrapala, et al. (2024) examined a larger sample size of 44 participants using a similar microgravity chair setup. This study focused on orthonasal aroma intensity perception across neutral and microgravity postures, revealing that differences between postures may be aroma specific. However, the selection of odors was limited, but the data showed the potential of the microgravity posture chair to improve space‐like presence when combined with other analogs or simulation methods (discussed in Section4.3). Overall, a key limitation of these studies is the lack of rigor in classical psychophysical study designs, such as incorporating multiple concentration levels and repeated measures. Despite this, the current method is promising for future research applications that mimic short‐term effects.

Mester et al. (1988) found that increased body tilt within the sagittal plane—0° (upright), 90° (supine), 135°, and 180° (upside down)—impaired odor identification performance, potentially due to tilt‐induced changes in cephalic circulation. However, nasal resistance measurements remained unchanged, possibly due to the limitations of the measurement techniques used. Later studies by Lundström et al. (2006,2007) confirmed that body position affects olfactory sensitivity at peri threshold levels, suggesting that cognitive factors, rather than blood flow changes, may play a more significant role. In the authors’ view, while the role of cognitive factors in peri threshold olfactory detection is plausible given the influence of attention and perception, the limited physiological evidence suggests that the contribution of circulatory changes cannot yet be definitively excluded particularly under conditions involving altered posture or gravity. Hort et al. (2008) observed no significant impact of body position on retronasal flavor discrimination, yet emphasized the need for further research with larger sample sizes to better understand the influence of posture on different aspects of flavor perception. These findings collectively provide a foundation for exploring how body posture may alter flavor perception, potentially through cognitive and sensory mechanisms that interact with environmental and physiological factors.

Physiological analogs, such as HDT studies, have been primarily employed to investigate general physiological and psychological responses to space‐like conditions. In the author's view, flavor perception has typically remained a secondary focus, resulting in limited advancement of sensory‐specific research relevant to long‐duration spaceflight. A number of methodological limitations further constrain the scope of current research. One key example is the reliance on electrogustometry, which is incapable of detecting nonionic taste qualities such as sweet and bitter. Moreover, by isolating taste from olfaction, it fails to capture the multisensory nature of flavor perception. Additionally, the method also does not account for the microgravity‐specific conditions such as nasal congestion, which can significantly affect overall flavor experience. Instead, authors recommend employing simplified tools such as filter paper strips or sealed liquid samples or Sniffin’ Sticks that preserve quality and safety under posture‐induced fluid shift conditions. The selection of these tools should be guided by the study's objective. For instance, if the goal is to assess sensory sensitivity, filter paper strips may be more appropriate for dry compounds, whereas blister‐packed liquids may be required for soluble tastants. It is also essential to ensure that packaging maintains sample integrity throughout testing. In the case of olfactory testing, practical issues such as how to administer tools like Sniffin’ Sticks under altered posture or in microgravity (e.g., difficulty inserting into the nasal cavity safely and consistently) must be addressed. Importantly, if these tools are to be used in actual microgravity environments, comparable methods should be employed across relevant analog settings to ensure consistency and facilitate meaningful comparisons across conditions. This highlights the need for a broader planning framework that aligns testing procedures across simulations and real spaceflight scenarios.

Small sample sizes are another recurring limitation in both HDT and microgravity posture studies, reducing statistical power and generalizability. However, the authors suggest that the use of repeated measures not only enhances statistical power but also allows for the assessment of changes over time, providing more robust and reliable results.

Other analog models also present practical barriers for flavor research. While useful in broader physiological contexts, immersion studies introduce risks such as sample contamination, participant discomfort, and reduced focus during food evaluation, which the authors believe compromise their applicability to flavor research. Similarly, microgravity platforms such as parabolic flights offer only brief exposures to true microgravity (∼20 s), which limits their utility for studying gradual sensory adaptation. These flights are further constrained by the need to select participants who are resistant to motion sickness, which restricts feasibility. However, it is worth noting that parabolic flights offer a valuable analog by combining two critical aspects of spaceflight: short‐term microgravity exposure and a confined, operationally complex environment, both of which contribute to the ecological relevance of such simulations. These environments also provide an opportunity to evaluate the operational feasibility of sample handling, data recording, and participant responsiveness in a realistic space‐like setting. Although short in duration, such flights allow for the testing of immediate sensory responses and food delivery systems that could later be used in orbit.

In contrast, microgravity posture studies offer a cost‐effective and accessible means to investigate postural effects on sensory perception. However, their capacity to simulate fluid shifts akin to those in true microgravity is unclear. Additionally, gravity continues to affect food behavior, potentially influencing swallowing and aroma perception, which should be considered in the study's limitations. While posture‐based models may not replicate all physiological aspects of microgravity, they are valuable platforms to test food handling protocols and posture‐related changes in oral‐somatosensory experience before deploying methods in flight.

Despite these limitations, the authors claim that the physiological analogs remain a promising avenue for flavor perception research. HDT offers a stable platform for observing longer term sensory changes and should be more fully leveraged in future studies. Although parabolic flights present logistical challenges, their ability to simulate true weightlessness offers unique value for real‐time sensory testing. Authors recommend that researchers develop a coordinated strategy that bridges analog and in‐flight testing by validating tools and sample delivery systems stepwise from posture and HDT models to parabolic and orbital platforms. This approach can help standardize protocols for psychophysical evaluation under space constraints. With the emergence of private spaceflight providers (Iles et al.2023), there is an increasing opportunity to develop controlled experiments that explore short‐term flavor perception changes in actual microgravity environments. Nonetheless, current methods and devices may require modification to be functional and reliable in spaceflight conditions. Their suitability must be evaluated not only for scientific accuracy but also for operational practicality in resource‐limited and weightless environments.

Although the application of digital technologies to simulate space conditions remains limited, interest in using these methods for studying flavor perception in space analogs is growing. A total of six published studies on digital simulations related to space content have been identified, utilizing two distinct methods: audio‐ and video‐based simulations (n= 2) and VR (n= 2). Notably, one study compared the merits of VR and a physiological measure, while another study used a combination of video simulation and microgravity posture. Table8summarizes the findings of these studies.

Those less sensitive to the odors perceived significantly stronger almond odor in VR.

GCMS analysis linked these findings to benzaldehyde, a common compound in both vanilla and almond odors.

NASA neutral posture mimics “microgravity” posture using a commercial “zero‐gravity” outdoor chair set at 122°–124° (Low and Loke2024).

Some participants overlap across different parts of these studies, as they were involved in examining different aspects within the same study.

Tran (2023) conducted a comprehensive crossover study with 60 participants, investigating the effects of environmental sound (70 dB of actual ISS recordings; NASA's ISS recommended noise level) and no sound on taste perception. The study included two groups (30 participants each) and assessed the five basic tastes—sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami—using three concentrations of each taste quality in both aqueous solutions and chocolate puddings as model foods. The results revealed no significant differences in taste perception between the ISS sound and the no‐sound conditions, regardless of taste category or concentration (Tran and Duizer2023). The findings are interesting as they suggest there may be a more complex interaction between noise level and food perception. For instance, sensory studies investigating environmental white noise levels exceeding 70 dB, including airplane cabin noise, have shown significant effects on taste perception (Lim et al.2024; Woods et al.2011; Yan and Dando2015). This contrast highlights the possibility that noise levels below a certain threshold may have limited sensory impact. Further research is needed to investigate the potential influence of noise intensity and to explore multisensory integration, including the combined effects of sensorial experiences on flavor perception.

In a follow‐up study, Tran et al. (2024) explored the influence of contextual factors on odor perception using a 20‐min video simulation of a rocket launch, paired with environmental sounds at 70 dB based on NASA's ISS noise. The study utilizes multiple context‐evoking methods, including written imaginative scenarios and an immersive room setup (screen dimensions: 7.7 × 3.2 m, angled at 126° in the middle to create an illusion of depth). Affective responses (emotion, liking) to three food aromas (vanilla, almond, citrus) were assessed at four time points during the video. Importantly, immersion via screens did not significantly impact aroma perception, suggesting that the combination of visual and auditory stimuli alone may not effectively replicate the sensory demands of spaceship‐related confined environments. The frequency of positive responses dipped slightly and then increased throughout the experiment, while the opposite was observed for the negative emotions. It is possible that responses were task‐related effects (e.g., feeling more positive nearing task completion). This pilot study highlights the importance of considering the duration of testing for emotional responses to emerge. However, the lack of significant effects raises questions about the utility of screens and sound alone for sensory simulations in space‐related tasks.

Loke, Chand, et al. (2024) conducted a study with 54 participants to examine food odor perception in a virtual spacecraft environment. Participants evaluated the intensity of three odors (vanilla, almond, and lemon) in two contexts: a neutral context and a VR simulation replicating the ISS. The VR environment featured floating objects, operational sounds to mimic space conditions, and an integrated questionnaire in the VR itself. Odor intensity was rated on a 5‐point Likert scale for one concentration, revealing significantly higher intensity for vanilla and almond in VR, while lemon odor remained consistent across contexts. Further analysis revealed that participants with lower baseline odor sensitivity perceived stronger almond and vanilla odors in VR in general. Interestingly, the authors suggest that the increased perception of almond and vanilla odors was likely due to the presence of benzaldehyde, a volatile compound detected in both these odors during GC–MS analysis. While benzaldehyde is not typically found in commercial vanilla extracts, its presence was likely due to its use as a food additive.

In a follow‐up pilot study exploring the duration required for individuals to perceive feelings of isolation within a VR environment, Low and Loke (2024) investigated odor intensity and emotional responses among 16 participants. Participants were exposed to four distinct odors (vanilla, almond, lemon, and eucalyptus) and evaluated these at two time points. Participants remained in the VR environment as long as possible until they began to feel isolated, at which point the second evaluation occurred. The findings revealed that increased odor intensity perception and emotional responses, initially neutral or positive (e.g., “interested,” “attentive”), shifted to more negative emotion terms (e.g., “nervous,” “guilty”) after spending approximately 9 min and 35 s in the VR environment. Importantly, the study also identified clusters of participants based on their emotional regulation and reactions to the VR experience, highlighting significant individual variation in how participants perceive and respond to isolation in a VR spaceship context. This demonstrates VR's potential as a ground‐based analog for sensory research but a need to account for individual variation in how they interact with VR tools, by evoking both sensory and emotional experiences related to food and highlighting its utility in advancing sensory research.

Acknowledging the importance of combining simulation tools, Loke, Chandrapala, et al. (2024) compared odor perception between microgravity posture and VR simulation, to understand the variation in odor intensity for eight odors including vanilla, almond, peppermint, vinegar, eucalyptus, lemon, lemon myrtle, and lemongrass. Their study demonstrated that odor intensity was significantly heightened in the VR environment compared to the microgravity posture for most odors. Notably, polarizing, trigeminal (e.g., eucalyptus, peppermint, vinegar), and citrus (e.g., lemon, lemon myrtle) aromas were perceived more intensely in VR, likely due to shared chemical attributes identified through GC–MS analysis (e.g., benzaldehyde in almond and vanilla extracts) and trigeminal properties (e.g., menthol in peppermint). In contrast, floral odors like lemongrass showed no difference across contexts, possibly due to their simpler volatile profiles (Loke, Chandrapala, et al.2024). The authors emphasized that both approaches were different; while the microgravity posture replicates the physical aspects of space conditions, VR provides immersive visual–spatial cues. However, neither method alone fully replicates the comprehensive immersive experience of actual microgravity. The authors proposed an integrated approach for a more engaging space‐like simulation, but technological constraints of VR at the time prevented the methods from being combined.

More recently, Gonzalez Viejo, Harris, Tongson, et al. (2024) combined microgravity posture with 180° video simulations to explore sensory perception in space‐like environments. Fifty‐one participants evaluated six leafy greens (e.g., kale, lettuce, basil) across four contexts, assessing aroma, texture, and overall liking, alongside biometric and facial expression measures. While the study found minimal differences across contexts, head movements varied when screens were used with the microgravity posture, possibly due to unconscious tilting in response to the immersive setup lacking ceiling projections, despite instructions to focus on the screen. For astronauts, sensory perception is shaped by physiological changes and the isolation of space, as discussed in Section4.2. Although the combination of microgravity postures and space‐themed video simulations elicited mixed emotional responses due to the novelty of the setup, this highlights a key limitation. Earth‐based simulations with microgravity posture chairs and projection screens alone may not replicate the multidimensional sensory and psychological challenges of real space‐living environments, where the confined and cluttered conditions of a space shuttle introduce additional stressors that may explain discrepancies in findings.

An interesting study not focused on food‐related sensory perception but relevant to posture in immersive environments is that of Jiang, Gong, et al. (2023) and Jiang, Fang, et al. (2023). They examined the effects of HDT position (body fluid movements) rather than microgravity posture chairs. Their findings demonstrated that VR combined with varied postures, such as −12° HDT and 9.6° head‐up tilt (seated for up to 3 h prior to evaluation), significantly influenced cognitive performance, emotional states, perceptions of environmental color settings, and visual tracking. Notably, HDT reduced task performance and positive emotional responses across different environmental color conditions (Jiang, Gong, et al.2023) and reduced visual tracking accuracy (Jiang, Fang, et al.2023), highlighting the importance of accounting for postural effects in immersive sensory studies. However, the integration of HDT with other environmental or social factors, particularly in the context of flavor perception, remains unexplored.

Both immersive screens and VR simulations offer valuable opportunities for replicating space‐like environments in sensory research, particularly for food‐ and sensory‐related studies. However, these tools differ significantly in their ability to evoke sensory and emotional responses, necessitating careful consideration of the research objectives when selecting between them. VR appears to offer stronger emotional and sensory engagement for environments aimed at simulating confined or stressful space conditions. Studies demonstrate that VR can evoke evolving emotional states over time, such asnervousnessandloneliness, which may align closely with psychological challenges associated with space‐like confinement (Low and Loke2024). In contrast, immersive screens tend to produce more stable emotional responses, typically neutral or positive responses (Gonzalez Viejo, Harris, Tongson, et al.2024; Tran2023). While this distinction suggests different applications, further research is required to determine the long‐term effects of both methods in space simulations.

VR's heightened engagement also extends to sensory responses. For instance, odors such as almond and vinegar elicited varying emotional and sensory outcomes during VR exposure, with positive emotions amplifying odor perception and stress dampening the perception of polarizing scents like vinegar (Loke, Chandrapala, et al.2024). Notably, prolonged VR exposure led to shifts toward negative emotional states, highlighting the importance of temporal dynamics when simulating sensory and emotional experiences. A significant limitation of both methods, however, is the potential influence of novelty or unfamiliarity with simulated environments on participants’ responses. This raises questions about whether the observed emotional and sensory outcomes truly reflect space‐like contexts or are instead driven by initial exposure effects. Given that astronauts undergo extensive training and may experience adaptation over time, future research should explore how prolonged exposure to these simulations influences sensory perception and psychological states. Additionally, handling food products in VR versus immersive screen environments presents a practical consideration. The way individuals interact with food, utensils, and packaging may differ significantly between the two methods, potentially influencing sensory experiences. Future research should address this by incorporating repeated VR exposures to explore the long‐term effects of familiarity. Additionally, validating these findings through comparisons with established analogs, such as long‐term terrestrial confinement studies, would enhance their ecological validity and strengthen their applicability for space research.

In the authors’ view, the focus of many studies has been limited to odor perception due to its simplicity, neglecting the complex integration of taste and smell required for real food‐based sensory evaluations. Additionally, there is a limited understanding of how varying concentrations of flavor compounds impact sensory perception in digital simulations. This limitation prevents a comprehensive understanding of how digital simulations can replicate real space flavor experiences.

Moreover, current studies often employ VR sessions lasting under 10 min, which may be insufficient to account for individual variability in sensory responses. The lack of standardized protocols for VR exposure times limits the reliability of sensory findings and their applicability to confined environments. In addition, many VR simulations use low‐resolution, low‐polygon models of environments of ISS, which reduces the immersive quality of the experience, potentially diminishing the accuracy of sensory evaluations. The authors suggest that upgrading VR simulations to enhance the actual spaceship environment could enhance immersion and isolation. This may include integrating real‐time environmental variables (e.g., soundscape, light control, tactile feedback) to more accurately mimic the sensory demands of long‐duration spaceflight.

Most studies lack direct comparisons to actual space environments, relying instead on hypotheses drawn from prior sensory‐context research. While these studies highlight the ecological validity of using context to evaluate sensory responses, the authors argue that it remains unclear whether the sensory reactions observed in simulated environments accurately replicate those experienced in real confined or space‐like conditions. An additional challenge in VR‐based flavor perception research is the limited ability to interact with and visualize food in a realistic manner, which may influence sensory expectations and perceived flavor attributes. The authors recommend that developing improved haptic feedback and interaction systems could enhance the realism of food‐related tasks within digital simulations.

To address these limitations and advance the field, the authors suggest that incorporating actual foods and beverages into VR simulations is essential to explore the interplay between taste and smell comprehensively. Research should also explore food consumption experiences (i.e., more realistic eating experience) within VR to better simulate real‐world sensory interactions in confined environments. As part of this, testing different food delivery methods such as straw‐fed pouches or pre‐portioned trays within VR contexts may help identify mechanisms that can be adapted across simulation platforms and, eventually, in actual spaceflight. Furthermore, while posture has been shown to influence sensory responses in video‐based simulations, its role in VR remains underexplored. Studies should build on evidence from video‐based simulations to explore how posture interacts with VR in flavor perception. In the authors’ view, combining immersive environments with varied body positions, such as head‐down tilt postures (body fluid movements), could provide additional insights into sensory experiences under space‐like conditions.

From the authors’ perspective, when evaluating food‐related emotional responses in digital simulations of space environments, greater emphasis should be placed on cognitive and behavioral responses rather than relying solely on physiological indicators. While biometric tools can provide supplementary insights, current evidence suggests they may not reliably capture emotional or hedonic responses in immersive sensory studies independently of explicit measures (see systematic review, Low et al.2022), particularly in contexts involving complex stimuli such as food. This limitation becomes even more pronounced in extreme or altered environments, such as space or its analogs, where physiological changes unrelated to flavor perception may confound biometric data. Therefore, the reliability and interpretive validity of biometric measures in these settings warrant careful re‐evaluation. The integration of implicit and explicit measures can be valuable, but only when supported by well‐controlled, contextually sensitive study designs (an area requiring additional validation). Moreover, although VR‐based tools hold significant promise for simulating confined environments, their current hardware and interface capabilities may require adaptation for use in low‐gravity conditions. Effectiveness should be validated not only in terms of perceptual realism but also in terms of operational usability within microgravity or analog scenarios. Finally, the selection of methods, tools, and experimental designs should be determined by the specific research aims, resource constraints, and the required degree of environmental fidelity.

This review examines flavor perception in spaceflights, space analogs, and digital simulations, highlighting key advancements commensurate with an increased number of people traveling into space and an increase in spaceflight mission duration. Ongoing challenges have also been identified. While many studies have explored individual factors such as microgravity or confinement, the interplay between physiological, psychological, and environmental influences on sensory experiences remains insufficiently understood. Addressing these gaps is crucial for developing effective sensory strategies for long‐duration missions.

Enhancing simulation realism: Integrating VR with physiological simulations or parabolic flights offers a potential method for replicating space‐like conditions. VR can recreate spatial and visual elements, while parabolic flights provide brief microgravity exposure. However, the feasibility of VR‐based sensory assessments in parabolic flights is uncertain due to physical constraints and the short duration of weightlessness, which may limit ecological validity, particularly given the role of adaptation and familiarity in sensory perception.

Improving ecological validity in sensory studies: Future research should focus on ergonomic, reclined‐compatible VR systems to enhance space simulation realism. Mixed‐reality tools with passthrough cameras could enable natural food interactions, while incorporating social elements, such as viewing crew members in VR, may provide insights into the role of communal dining in sensory perception and food enjoyment. Additionally, studies should compare responses between unfamiliar confined and cluttered VR environments and familiar VR settings, as most participants have never experienced space. Investigating cognitive and perceptual differences between these conditions could help distinguish true space‐like context responses from novelty effects.

Targeted testing with relevant populations: Sensory studies conducted in Earth‐based analogs often rely on general populations, which may not accurately reflect the sensory responses of astronauts. Given their extensive training, physiological adaptations, and unique psychological profiles, astronauts (or astronaut candidates) may react differently to sensory stimuli in space‐like conditions. Future studies should focus on recruiting trained individuals to ensure findings apply to space missions, at least until affordable space tourism expands research opportunities.

Establishing standardized sensory testing methodologies: A lack of consistent protocols for sensory testing has limited the comparability of findings across studies. Future research should clearly define the type of sensory methods, appropriate scales, and sample formats. They should also be suited to posture and microgravity constraints. Data collection should use compact digital tools, and designs should include repeated measures to track changes over time. Establishing standardized sensory testing methodologies applicable to both spaceflights and analogs is essential to generate reliable data and support future advancements.

These recommendations underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches that combine advanced technologies, innovative methodologies, and standardized protocols to enhance the ecological validity of research in this domain. While advancements in space analogs and simulations have provided valuable insights, there is a need to address the limitations of current methodologies. A more comprehensive and integrative approach will be crucial to understanding flavor perception in space environments and to optimizing food systems that support astronauts’ sensory and nutritional needs during missions.
