Natural toxins are highly effective at targeting ion channels with high selectivity and potency. To date, all identified spider venom peptide toxins that modulate voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels inhibit Shab (KV2) or Shal-related isoforms (KV4) by interacting with their voltage-sensing domains. In this study, we report novel spider-derived pore-blocking toxins that selectively target Shaker-type (KV1) channels with nanomolar potency. We isolated murinotoxins MnTx-1 and MnTx-2 from the orange baboon tarantulaPterinochilus murinusand sequenced them using a combination of Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, and venom gland nanopore transcriptomics. MnTx-1 was produced recombinantly, and its NMR solution structure was determined. Although MnTx-1 shares sequence motifs common to spider toxins, it displays a distinctly different three-dimensional structure, featuring an alternative disulfide linkage, which we have termed the Disulfide-Reined Hairpin (DRH). We attribute the unique pharmacology of MnTx-1 to its unusual spatial structure. The DRH motif represents a promising new miniature scaffold for future bioengineering applications.

A clear trend in drug discovery is the growing use of peptide substances for clinical applications [1]. Compared to other pharmaceuticals, peptides offer several advantages, including high potency, unique selectivity, and low toxicity [2–4]. Furthermore, ongoing advances in biochemistry and pharmacology are addressing the limitations of peptides, including low oral bioavailability, poor plasma stability, and short circulation times. Currently, approximately 80 peptide drugs are available on the global market, with more than 150 candidates undergoing clinical trials and an additional 400–600 peptides in preclinical studies [1,5].

Animal venoms are a promising and abundant source of pharmacologically active peptides, representing natural cocktails of evolutionary selected, specific, potent, and stable compounds [6,7]. Several venom-derived peptides have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including an antidiabetic peptide from the lizardHeloderma suspectum(Gila monster) and an analgesic peptide derived from the cone snailConus magus. Additionally, several venom-derived lead compounds are in clinical or preclinical development, including a monomeric insulin from a cone snail [8], a sea anemone peptide for treating autoimmune diseases [9], a tumor-targeting peptide from scorpion venom [10], a spider toxin with potential applications in heart transplantation and neuroprotection after stroke [11,12], and several toxins from various sources being explored as analgesics [13–16].

Many venom-derived peptides target ion channels, which are pore-forming transmembrane proteins that regulate ion flux across cell membranes [17,18]. In humans, ion channels are the third most numerous group of proteins involved in signal transduction [19] and the second largest target for marketed drugs [20,21]. Interestingly, more than a quarter of all known ion channel isoforms in the human genome belong to the potassium (K+) channel superfamily [22], which represents significant therapeutic targets [23,24].

According to the Kalium database (https://kaliumdb.org/), over 400 natural polypeptides target K+channels, with nearly all acting as inhibitors [25]; only a few toxins function as channel activators [26,27]. Inhibition of K+channels by peptide ligands occurs through two distinct mechanisms [28,29]. Pore-blocking toxins from snakes, scorpions, sea anemones, cone snails, and other sources bind to the outer vestibule of the channels, obstructing the passage of K+ions through the permeation pathway or pore [30,31]. Alternatively, gating-modifier toxins from spiders stabilize non-conducting states of K+channels by interacting with their voltage-sensing domain [32,33]. Notably, spider toxins tend to preferentially modulate the gating of Shab (KV2) and Shal-related isoforms (KV4), whereas most other animal venom peptides block multiple K+channel subtypes, with a strong preference for Shaker type (KV1) channels [34,35].

Through function-based screening of spider venom fractions, we identified an unexpected activity in the venom of the orange baboon tarantulaPterinochilus murinusPocock, 1897 (Fig.1A) that inhibited Shaker-type K+channels, an unprecedented finding in spider venom. This tarantula, commonly known as OBT among pet keepers, inhabits Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa and has several color morphs, some of which were previously classified as distinct species [36,37]. Bites from these spiders have been reported to cause “more violent pain than the sting of a scorpion”, and often lead to cold sweats and fainting, possibly contributing to arachnophobia in people, both at present and in the past [38,39]. We identified the active compound responsible for K+channel block as a peptide with a novel folding pattern, a feature more commonly associated with conotoxins and sea anemone peptides. Unlike the conserved structural motifs typically found in venom from snakes, scorpions, and spiders, this discovery highlights an alternative venom-derived peptide structure with unique pharmacology, offering novel insights into protein science and venomics.

Crude venom ofP. murinuswas initially fractionated using reverse-phase (RP) HPLC, and its components were pooled into six major fractions (I–VI; Fig.1B). Electrophysiological measurements indicated predominant activity against Shaker-related channels in fraction I (Table1). Components of this fraction were then tested individually, revealing the activity in two subfractions. Each step of electrophysiological measurements was conducted using material derived from the separation of 2.5 µL of crude venom (or its dry equivalent of ≈ 0.5 mg). To isolate individual active compounds, these subfractions were subjected to a second round of separation by RP-HPLC (Fig.1C, D). This process yielded single symmetrical Gaussian peaks corresponding to > 98% purity for both substances, which were designated murinotoxins (MnTx-1 or κ1-theraphotoxin-Pmu3a and MnTx-2 or κ1-theraphotoxin-Pmu3b). Further analysis using MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) showed monoisotopic molecular masses of 3851.7 Da and 3913.7 Da (Fig.1E, F) for MnTx-1 and MnTx-2, respectively.

Alkylation of non-reduced MnTx-1 and MnTx-2 with 4-vinylpyridine revealed no free thiol groups in the native peptides, as confirmed by MS analysis. However, the mass differences (636.6 Da) between the native and reduced-alkylated peptides indicated that both MnTx-1 and MnTx-2 contain six half-cystine residues. Direct Edman degradation provided partial N-terminal sequences consisting of 33 amino acid residues (Fig.2A, Fig.S1E). Differences of measured and calculated molecular masses indicated the full-length sequences of both toxins consist of 35 amino acids, leaving the two C-terminal residues undetermined. To complete the primary structure, we constructed and sequenced a cDNA library fromP. murinusvenom glands for further analysis.

We obtained sequencing data from a single venom gland sample using two technologies: 12,527,935 paired-end reads of Illumina (2 × 125 bp) and 17,890,347 long-reads of Oxford Nanopore following the direct cDNA sequencing protocol. On the first step, we assembled thede novotranscriptome from short-reads, resulting in 45,721 contig sequences (transcripts). To identify target transcripts, we performed a local search using BlastX and the toxin reference sequences established by Edman degradation. This process resulted in the selection of several potentially suitable sequences. Despite the high accuracy of short-reads, during the reconstruction (assembly) of transcripts, the occurrence of assembly artifacts cannot be ruled out. To verify the results, we utilized full-length Nanopore cDNA reads. The archived data have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession number PRJNA1252972. Initially, nanopore cDNA reads were clustered based on sequence similarity using the RATTLE program [40]. This algorithm allows the assembly of consensus sequences corresponding to transcripts without requiring a reference in the form of a genome. By searching for correspondences of translated sequences, we identified two transcripts containing complete coding frames for MnTx-1 and 2 (Fig.S1G). The deduced amino acid sequence of the full precursor protein for MnTx-1 is shown in Fig.2A. Mature MnTx peptides differ by three residues (Fig.S1E; UniProt IDs: C0HMD2 and C0HMD3).

Recombinant MnTx-1 was produced following our standard approach, usingE. coliSHuffle T7 Express as the host strain [41]. The gene encoding the peptide was amplified by PCR (TableS1) and subcloned into pET-32b(+) expression vector. MnTx-1 was fused with thioredoxin (Trx) as a partner to ensure a high yield of the disulfide-containing peptide (Fig.S1A). The chimeric protein was then digested with CNBr, followed by separation using RP-HPLC and identification by MALDI MS (Fig.S1B). Due to a sizable portion of the toxin being misfolded, we performed a refolding procedure (Fig.S1C, D). A final round of RP-HPLC purification on an analytical column yielded the target peptide in an individual state. The measured molecular mass of the purified recombinant MnTx-1 matched the calculated value. Co-elution of natural MnTx-1 and its recombinant analogue confirmed their identity (Fig.S1F). Furthermore,1H NMR spectra recorded for both the native and recombinant MnTx-1 additionally support their structural identity (Fig.S2).

The 3D structure of the peptide in aqueous solution was solved using NMR spectroscopy. A total of 100 structures were calculated using the torsion angle restraints, upper NOE-based distance restraints, and hydrogen and disulfide bond restraints (Fig.S3). Detailed data are provided in TableS2. The final set of 10 NMR structures showed low RMSD values for backbone atoms (0.07 ± 0.03 Å) and heavy atoms (0.56 ± 0.06 Å), with minimal restraint violations, indicating that the structure is well defined by the experimental data (Fig.2D). The conformation of MnTx-1 is stabilized by three disulfide bridges (C3–C17, C10–C32, and C16–C22; Fig.2B, E) and 11 hydrogen bonds. The surface of the molecule is predominantly positively charged, except for a hydrophobic cluster composed of I4, W9, P11, A14, and P15 side chains (Fig.2F).

Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology was used to assess the effects of MnTx-1 on voltage-gated potassium (KV) and sodium (NaV) channels. The peptide inhibited K+currents mediated by KV1.1, KV1.2, KV1.3, KV1.6, and KV1.7 channels (Fig.3, Fig.S4), whereas currents from the KV2–4 subfamilies, as well as those mediated by NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 channels, were resistant to micromolar concentrations of MnTx-1 (Fig.3A, TableS3). Representative current traces for KV1.1 and KV1.6 exposed to increasing MnTx-1 concentrations, along with corresponding steady-state concentration-response curves, are shown in Fig.3B. The IC50values for MnTx-1 inhibition of KV1.1 and KV1.6-mediated currents were 1.1 ± 0.6 nM (n= 5) and 4.4 ± 1.0 nM (n= 6), respectively (h = 0.7), indicating high potency. KV1.2 was moderately sensitive, with an IC50of 171.1 ± 16.9 nM (n= 8). KV1.3 exhibited lower sensitivity, IC50= 381 ± 40 nM (n= 5). Thus, among the KV1 channels assessed, KV1.1 and KV1.6 exhibited the greatest sensitivity to MnTx-1.

Pore blockers inhibit KVchannel function by physically obstructing the ion conduction pathway, typically through binding within the channel pore, preventing the passage of potassium ions and effectively blocking channel activity. MnTx-1 rapidly inhibited KV1 currents upon application, with the inhibition being readily reversible after washout (Fig.4A), suggestive of a direct interaction with the pore domain of KV1 channels. The half-activation potential of KV1.1-mediated currents in the absence and presence of MnTx-1 (10 nM) was indistinguishable (two-tailed paired t-testp= 0.50) (Fig.4B), indicating that MnTx-1 does not affect the voltage-dependent activation properties of KV1.1. The apparent increased MnTx-1 block observed at more negative potentials aligns with the voltage range where KV1.1 transitions between resting to activated states, suggesting possible state-dependent toxin binding.

Compared to other KV1 family members, differences in the amino acid residues lining the pore and vestibule of KV1.5 make it less susceptible to pore-blocking peptide toxins [29,42,43]. Consistent with this, MnTx-1 failed to inhibit KV1.5-mediated currents, even at micromolar concentrations (Fig.4D). Sequence alignment of the pore loops of KV1.2 and KV1.5 highlights key differences between the toxin-sensitive and toxin-insensitive isoforms (Fig.4C). Substituting V381 with the corresponding KV1.5 residue (R381) nearly eliminated MnTx-1 sensitivity of KV1.2 (Fig.4D), emphasizing the critical role of specific pore residues in MnTx-1 binding.

We have identified two novel spider venom peptides with unique structural and functional features, likely representing a new class of toxins. While previous studies hinted at similar sequences in tarantulas, these were based on transcriptomic data without peptide verification or on proteomic data with incomplete sequencing (Fig.2A). For example, two related toxins were detected in the venom of the Chinese earth tiger tarantulaChilobrachys guangxiensis, which were only partially sequenced and later fully reconstructed from the transcriptome [44,45]. Similarly, analysis of expressed sequence tags from the venom glands of the Chinese bird spiderCyriopagopus schmidtirevealed a transcript with high similarity to MnTx [46]. The highest similarity score was observed for peptides with partially determined primary structures from the venom of the Salem ornamental tarantulaPoecilotheria formosa[47]. However, those peptides were not purified in sufficient quantities to enable thorough functional characterization. In the present study, we purified and determined the complete primary structures of two MnTx (MnTx-1 and MnTx-2), along with their precursor sequences (Fig.2A). These precursors exhibit the typical architecture of spider venom-derived peptides, consisting of signal peptides, propeptides with well-defined processing quadruplet motifs (PQM), and mature chains [48,49].

MnTx, along with related peptides from other tarantula species, share the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) cysteine framework [50]. They also contain an unusually high number of proline residues (up to five) and a high proportion of positively charged amino acids, resulting in a net charge of + 7 to + 9 at neutral pH.

Spider toxins that affect K+channels are well-known tools to target Shab (KV2) and Shal-related isoforms (KV4), as was first demonstrated by Swartz and MacKinnon, who discovered hanatoxins in the venom of the Chilean rose tarantulaGrammostola rosea[32,51]. While some spider venom-derived polypeptide ligands possess selective activity against specific ion channels, target promiscuity is also a common phenomenon [35]. As a result, the pharmacological profile of these toxins can extend to other K+channels, such as hERG (KV11) [52], and even to other ion channels, including voltage-gated calcium (CaV) and sodium (NaV) channels [53–56]. Minor examples of spider toxins include inhibitors of EAG (KV10) [57] and insect Ca2+-activated large conductance K+channels [58,59]. There is also evidence of weak activity of hanatoxin-1 against Shaker-IR [51] and two Kunitz-type huwentoxins against KV1.1 [60,61], though only at micromolar concentrations. To date, high-affinity inhibitors of KV1 have not been found from spider venom.

Earlier studies have reported two pterinotoxins, β-theraphotoxin-Pmu1a and β/κ-theraphotoxin-Pmu2a, isolated from the venom ofP. murinus, which affect several NaVchannels and KV11.1 [62]. Another toxin, µ/ω-theraphotoxin-Pmu1a, exhibits dual inhibitory activity on NaVand CaV3 channels [63]. Although these substances have not been assessed against a broader range of K+channels, potential promiscuity is not unexpected given their mode of action (see below). In contrast to these polypeptides, MnTx selectively block Shaker-type K+channels with strong preference for KV1.1 and KV1.6, whereas KV2–4 channels are insensitive to these toxins (Fig.3). Furthermore, the venom fraction containing MnTx showed no effect on KV7.1, KV10.1, KV11.1 (Table1), or several human NaVchannels. This molecular pharmacology is highly unusual for spider toxins and is more reminiscent of compounds found in other venomous animals such as snakes, scorpions, sea anemones, and cone snails.

Before the discovery of hanatoxins [32], the only known mechanism by which toxins inhibited K+channels involved binding to the outer pore region and physical blockage of K+conduction. This mode of action was studied extensively through mutagenesis, initially using scorpion toxins, and later with peptides from other species. The hallmark of this mechanism is the projection of a key lysine residue from the toxin into the pore of the channel, where it interacts with potassium ions within the selectivity filter [31,64,65]. This ligand-channel stabilization can be also reinforced by an aromatic amino acid from the toxin, which together with the key lysine residue, forms a ‘functional dyad’ [66]. Further structural studies confirmed this mechanism through the examination of complexes between: (i) charybdotoxin from scorpion venom and KV1.2–KV2.1 paddle chimera [67]; (ii) Fab-modified sea anemone toxin ShK and KV1.3 [68]; and (iii) snake α-dendrotoxin and KV1.2 [69].The first evidence that peptide toxins can inhibit K+channels through a mode other than pore occlusion came from experiments with tarantula toxins [32,33]. As with pore blockers, mutagenesis was used to identify specific amino acid residues involved in channel-toxin recognition. A solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface, along with several surrounding basic residues, constitute the active face of the toxins [70], which bind to the S3–S4 region of the voltage-sensing domain [51,71]. This mechanism, often referred to as “membrane-access” model [72], is believed to proceed through the partitioning of toxins into the lipid membrane followed by lateral association with the voltage-sensing domains of the channels [73,74].

To investigate the mechanism of action of MnTx, we performed electrophysiological measurements using a mutant KV1.2 channel. KV1.2 was selected for mutational analysis due to the availability of high-resolution structural data, which offer a robust framework for interpreting toxin-channel interactions. Owing to its high sequence similarity to KV1.1 and KV1.6, KV1.2 is widely accepted as an appropriate structural surrogate for these isoforms. In this context, we introduced a single-point mutation in the pore region, substituting valine with arginine (V381R), to assess its impact on MnTx-1 sensitivity. This site was selected based on the observation that MnTx-1 inhibits KV1.2 but has no measurable effect on KV1.5, making KV1.2-V381R a suitable model for identifying key toxin-pore interaction sites. The substitution of valine with a bulky, positively charged arginine at the pore entrance (Fig.4C) was expected to disrupt binding through steric and electrostatic repulsion. As shown in Fig.4D, this mutation significantly reduced MnTx-1-mediated current inhibition, supporting its action as a pore blocker. In light of prior work on Urotoxin [42], which demonstrated that a single-point mutation can confer sensitivity to otherwise resistant KVchannels, it would be of interest to examine the reciprocal substitution in KV1.5 (R487V) to determine whether a similar gain in MnTx-1 susceptibility can be achieved. We speculate that MnTx-1 functions similarly to the well-characterized toxins from scorpions, sea anemones, and cone snails, which employ a key lysine residue to obstruct the channel pore. Given that both MnTx-1 and MnTx-2 are active against KV1 channels (data not shown), it is possible that channel blockade occurs through the use of one of their eight identical lysine residues.

Only a few studies have provided evidence supporting the pore-blocking mechanism for spider venom peptides acting on K+channels [58,60]. Consequently, most spider-derived peptides that target K+channels became synonymous with “voltage-sensor toxins” or “gating modifiers” [75]. Our current study identifies a novel class of K+channel inhibitors from tarantula venom that occlude the channel pore, rather than alter gating. This type of pore-blocking toxin is likely to be just as significant a component of spider venom as voltage-sensor toxins. Future research may uncover additional members of this class in other tarantula species.

In contrast to marine invertebrates such as sea anemones and cone snails, terrestrial venomous animals tend to exploit conserved folds to build their toxin arsenal. For example, the highly populated scaffolds utilized by snakes, scorpions, and spiders are three-finger toxins (3FTх), cysteine-stabilized α-helix/β-sheet (CSα/β), and inhibitor cystine knot (ICK), respectively [28,76]. While the ICK motif [77] remains the predominant structure in spider venom, several other minor motifs have been identified in disulfide-rich peptides, including the disulfide-directed β-hairpin (DDH) [78], Kunitz-type [60], prokineticin/colipase [79], and helical arthropod-neuropeptide-derived motif (HAND) [80]. Additionally, a recent structural venomics study revealed several potential non-ICK toxins, such as peptides featuring the disulfide-stabilized antiparallel β-hairpin stack motif (DABS) [81].

The cysteine framework in MnTx is CIX6CIIX5CIIIX0CIVX5CVX9CVI(where X represents any amino acid; Fig.2A), which closely resembles the framework found in ICK-containing peptides [50]. This structural motif usually contains an antiparallel β-hairpin, stabilized by disulfide bridges with the following connectivity: CI–CIV, CII–CV, and CIII–CVI. A key feature of the ICK is that two of the disulfide bridges (CI–CIVand CII–CV) and intervening stretches of backbone segments form a ring that is penetrated by the third disulfide bridge (CIII–CVI), creating a pseudoknot structure (77). Unexpectedly, the NMR study of MnTx-1 revealed an alternative fold, previously uncharacterized for spider-derived peptides (Fig.2C–F). Instead of the canonical ICK disulfide connectivity, we observed the following disulfide bond arrangement: CI–CIV, CII–CVI, and CIII–CV. This new fold lacks the penetrated ring structure, and the two corresponding cystines anchor the C-terminal loop to the N-terminal cysteine-rich core without any crossover. Additionally, the typical antiparallel β-hairpin is absent. Given these unique structural features, we propose naming this new structural motif the Disulfide-Reined Hairpin (DRH).

Refolding experiments (Fig.S1B–D) suggest that the DRH structure is energetically favored in MnTx compared to other potential folds, including the ICK motif. This implies that the DRH scaffold may also be the preferred structure for a broader group of peptides that share similarities with MnTx (Fig.2A). It is possible that a subset of spider toxins, previously thought to adopt the ICK motif, may in fact assume the DRH fold. Regardless, this newly identified minifold presents an exciting opportunity for future bioengineering efforts.

The venom ofP. murinuscontains peptide toxins with unprecedented structural and pharmacological properties. MnTx-1 and MnTx-2, described here, are the founding members of a new class of spider toxins that adopt the novel DRH fold with unique disulfide connectivity. These toxins act as high-affinity, selective pore blockers of Shaker-type (KV1) channels, a function not previously recognized in spider venoms. Similar peptides from other tarantula species are likely to be identified and classified within this emerging family of KV1 channel blockers. Our findings not only advance the understanding of protein structure-function relationships but also provide new tools for biotechnological scaffold engineering applications.

All procedures involving animals were performed following the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) [82] and the “European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes” (Strasbourg, 18.III.1986). The use of the frogs was in accordance with the license number LA1210239 to Toxicology and Pharmacology, KU Leuven, and was approved by the Ethical Committee for animal experiments of KU Leuven (P186/2019). Maximum efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used in the experiments.

P. murinusvenom (5 µL for each separation) was fractionated using RP-HPLC with a Jupiter C5column (4.6 × 250 mm; particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 300 Å; Phenomenex). The separation utilized a linear gradient of acetonitrile concentration (0–60% over 60 min) in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a flow rate of 1 mL·min–1. Fractions were collected based on absorbance at two wavelengths, 210 and 280 nm, then freeze-dried and stored at −20 °C. Immediately before the experiments, fractions were reconstituted in 10 µL of ND96 solution containing (in mM): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4.

To perform direct protein sequencing, the purified toxins were first reduced and alkylated as described previously [83]. The modified peptides were then separated using RP-HPLC with a Jupiter C5column. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the modified peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation using a PPSQ-33 A protein sequencer (Shimadzu Biotech), following the manufacturer’s recommended protocols.

Thirty-six hours after successful milking via electrostimulation, the test subject was exposed to carbon dioxide in a closed container for 1 h. Subsequently, the spider’s abdomen was severed from the cephalothorax to prevent resuscitation, as the abdomen contains the heart and lungs. The chelicerae were separated from the cephalothorax along the articular membrane with scissors. Each chelicera was then cut lengthwise on both sides, and the cuticle was removed from one side. The venom glands, which in tarantulas are fully enclosed within the chelicerae, and do not extend into the cavity of cephalothorax, were separated from muscular tissue with needles. The gland duct was cut at the exit in the fang of chelicerae, and the extracted glands were placed in tubes containing RNA stabilizer (IntactRNA; Evrogen, Russia) and stored at −80 °C.

Frozen spider venom glands, stored at −80 °C, were homogenized using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue fragments using the ExtractRNA reagent (Evrogen). The concentration and quality of the total RNA were assessed by the Quant-it RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the RNA 6000 Pico Kit for 2100 Bioanalyzer Systems (Agilent Technologies), respectively. Starting material (200 ng total RNA) was used to prepare the library according to the published protocol (10.17504/protocols.io.yxmvmkpxng3p/v1). The sequencing library for Oxford Nanopore PromethION was created using the Direct cDNA Sequencing Kit SQK-DCS109 (amplification-free), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and run in a FLO-PRO002 (R9.4.1) flow cell. Raw data were basecalled using Guppy v6.5.7. (guppy basecaller) in high-accuracy (HAC) mode with a qscore cutoff of 7. The RNA library was prepared using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module and the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The final library was cleaned up using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter). The libraries size distribution and quality were assessed using a high-sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies), and they were subsequently quantified with the Quant-iT dsDNA High-Sensitivity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equimolar quantities of all libraries (10 pmol) were sequenced in a high-throughput run on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, using 2 × 100 bp paired-end reads and a 1% PhiX spike-in control. Quality control of the raw sequence data was performed with FastQC. Trimmomatic was used to trim the adapter sequences used for cDNA synthesis.

The short-read transcriptome wasde novoreconstructed using the Trinity assembler [84] with default parameters. TransDecoder (https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder) was used to identify putative ORFs with a minimum length of 30 amino acids. Long-reads sequencing was used to identify and validate full-length transcripts and potential splice variants. ReorientExpress [85] was applied to perform reference-free orientation of transcriptomic long sequencing reads. Nanopore cDNA reads clustering was performed using RATTLE [40]. For the identification of target peptide toxins, two complementary approaches were used: homology searches using BlastP/BlastX against the non-redundant (NR) database with an e-value cutoff of 0.001, and Cys-pattern searches using EMBOSS fuzzpro [86].

To produce a recombinant analogue of MnTx-1, we followed our standard approach for disulfide-rich polypeptide production [41]. Briefly, we used the pET-32b(+) vector (Novagen), which allows the production of target polypeptides as His-tagged fusions with Trx. Since MnTx-1 lacks methionine residues, we introduced a methionine site immediately before MnTx-1 to facilitate CNBr cleavage. Additionally, we used a mutated variant of the pET-32b vector (pET-32bM/L), in which all internal Met residues in Trx were replaced with Leu. The gene encoding MnTx-1 was synthesized using a two-step PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides (TableS1) and inserted into pET-32b throughKpnI andBamHI restriction, followed by ligation. The resulting vector, pET-32bM/L-MnTx-1, was then used to transformEscherichia coliSHuffle T7 Express cells (New England Biolabs), optimized for the expression of transgenes with T7 promoter and enhanced capacity to correctly fold proteins containing multiple disulfide bonds within the cytoplasm.

The transformed bacteria were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C with vigorous stirring to the mid-log phase (A600≈ 0.5). Expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG, and the bacteria were cultured at 24 °C for 16 h. Subsequently, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in the start buffer for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The cells were lysed by ultrasonication, and the lysate was centrifuged. The soluble fraction was applied to a HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the His-tagged fusion protein was purified by IMAC following the manufacturer’s protocol using imidazole for elution. Protein expression was verified by SDS-PAGE using 12% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad). CNBr cleavage reaction was performed for Trx-MnTx-1 digestion [87]. The target toxin was purified from the reaction solution via RP-HPLC using a Jupiter C5column (10 × 250 mm; particle size, 10 μm; pore size, 300 Å; Phenomenex) with a 60-min linear gradient of acetonitrile concentration (0–60%) in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 5 mL·min–1. A second RP-HPLC step was performed using a Luna C18column (4.6 × 250 mm; particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 100 Å; Phenomenex) applying a similar acetonitrile gradient (0–60% over 60 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL·min–1. The purity of the recombinant polypeptide was assessed by analytical HPLC and confirmed by MS. Concentrations of chimeric protein and the target toxin were calculated based on UV absorbance of aromatic amino acid residues at 280 nm.

To increase the yield of target peptides, a refolding procedure was performed as described by Logashina et al. [88]. For this, oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich) were added at a concentration of 1 mM and 4 mM, respectively, to 1 mg of the chimeric protein purified immediately after IMAC. Refolding was conducted for three days at 16 °C, followed by digestion and purification as described above.

Molecular mass measurements were performed using MALDI on an Ultraflex TOF-TOF (Bruker Daltonik) spectrometer, as previously described in detail [89]. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the matrix. Measurements were performed in both linear and reflectron modes. Calibration was performed using the ProteoMass Peptide and Protein MALDI-MS Calibration Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Mass spectra were analyzed using Data Analysis 4.3 (Bruker) and TOPPView [90].

All NMR experiments were conducted using the Avance II 700 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Germany) at 30 °C. The protein sample was dissolved in H2O/D2O (19:1), and pH was adjusted to 7.4.1H,13C assignments were obtained via the standard procedure [91], using 2D TOCSY, 2D NOESY (with 40 ms and 80 ms mixing times),13C-HSQC, and15N-HSQC spectra. After recording the initial set of spectra, the MnTx-1 sample was lyophilized and redissolved in 100% D2O (Acros Organics) to measure the proton-deuterium exchange and to record 2D NOESY (80 ms mixing time) and DQF-COSY spectra.

The spatial structure was calculated using the simulated annealing/molecular dynamics protocol implemented in the CYANA software package (version 3.98.13) [92]. Upper interproton distance restraints were determined by 1/r6calibration of NOESY cross-peaks. Torsion angle restraints and stereospecific assignments were obtained from J-couplings and NOE intensities. Hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds were incorporated during the final stage of calculations, with disulfide linkages introduced based on NOE cross-peaks. Visual analysis of the calculated structures and figure drawings was performed using PyMOL software (Schrödinger). The structure was confirmed and deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the ID: 9JGG.

To screen the activity of venom fractions after separation, we expressed genes encoding the following voltage-gated potassium channels inXenopus laevisoocytes: rKV1.1 (GenBank accession number:NM_173095), rKV1.2 (NM_012970), hKV1.3 (NM_002232), rKV1.4 (NM_012971), rKV1.5 (NM_012972), rKV1.6 (NM_023954), rKV2.1 (NM_004975), hKV7.1 (NM_000218), hKV10.1 (NM_172362), hKV11.1 (NM_000238), and Shaker-IR fromDrosophila melanogaster(NM_167595; residues 6–46 removed) as described [93]. Linearized plasmids encoding the corresponding potassium channel genes were transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 or T7 Transcription Kits (Ambion) to prepare the respective cRNA. Oocytes were injected with 50 nL of cRNA at a concentration of 1 g·L–1using a micro-injector (Drummond Scientific). The oocytes were incubated at 16 °C in ND96 solution supplemented with 50 mg·L–1gentamicin sulfate.

Electrophysiological recordings were conducted at room temperature (18–22 °C) using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Molecular Devices), controlled by a pClamp data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). Whole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded 1–4 days after cRNA injection. The bath solution composition was ND96. Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl, and electrode resistances were maintained at 0.7–1.5 MΩ. Depolarization-activated currents were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered at 0.5 kHz for K+currents, using a four-pole low-pass Bessel filter. Leak subtraction was performed using a −P/4 protocol.

Currents were evoked by 500 ms step depolarization to the voltage corresponding to the maximal activation of the channels under control conditions, from a holding potential of −90 mV. Peak current amplitude was measured both before and after incubation with the sample. The time interval between depolarizing pulses was 8 s, allowing sufficient time for the channels to recover from inactivation. Eight pulses, totaling 1 min, were applied to achieve equilibrium block.

In-house generated stable HEK293 and CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the human orthologues of KV1.1 (GenBank accession number:NM_000217), KV1.2 (NM_004974), KV1.3 (NM_002232), KV1.5 (NM_002234), KV1.6 (NR_172523), KV1.7 (NM_031886), KV2.1 (NM_004975), KV3.4 (NM_001039574.3), and KV4.3 (NM_004980) were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2in DMEM and DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), respectively. CHO-K1 and HEK293T cells stably expressing human NaV1.7 (ChanClone) and NaV1.8 isoform (Scottish Biomedical) were cultured according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bovigen), 2 mM GlutaMAX, 100 U·mL–1penicillin, 10 mg·L–1streptomycin (Invitrogen), and/or the selection antibiotics blasticidin, G418 (Gibco) and hygromycin (Invitrogen). Cells were detached using TrypLE, resuspended in cold HBSS at a concentration of 100,000 cells·mL–1, and maintained in suspension in a Cell Hotel reservoir at 10 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.

Concentration-response relationships were determined using automated, high throughput patch-clamp electrophysiology on a SyncroPatch 384PE (Nanion Technologies, Germany) integrated with a Biomek FX pipetting robot (Beckman Coulter). High resistance, four-hole-per-well borosilicate glass patch clamp chips (Nanion Technologies) were used. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature (21–23 °C) with full compensation for chip and whole-cell capacitance and 70% series resistance compensation. Peak K+currents (IK) were elicited by either 50 ms or 150 ms test pulses to 20 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV at 0.1 Hz.

The intracellular solution consisted of 70 mM KCl, 60 mM KF, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH, 280 ± 3 mOsm). The extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH, 298 ± 3 mOsm). Seals were facilitated by brief exposure to a seal enhancer composed of 60 mM NMDG, 40 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 35 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH, 298 ± 3 mOsm), followed by thorough washing with the standard extracellular solution. All solutions were filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane, and lyophilized peptides were dissolved in extracellular solution on the day of experiments and diluted to final test concentrations.

Data acquisition and analysis were conducted using PatchControl 384 and DataControl 384 software (Nanion Technologies). Only cells with a seal resistance greater than 300 MΩ were included. Leak currents were subtracted using a −P/4 protocol.

Voltage dependence of block and reversibility was assessed using manual patch-clamp, employing the same recording solutions as used in the automated patch-clamp experiments. The KV1.2V381Rpore mutant construct was described previously [42]. Manual patch-clamp recordings were performed using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1550, and controlled via Clampex 11.1 software (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150F-15, Harvard Apparatus), and were fire-polished to a resistance of 1−3 MΩ. To minimize inactivation or rundown, a holding potential of −100 mV was used, with currents evoked by 25−150 ms depolarizing pulses to +20 mV at 0.1 Hz. Whole-cell currents were sampled at 100 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz, and series resistance was compensated by 60−80%.

where IC50is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, and h is the Hill coefficient (nH).

Instantaneous current-voltage relationships were obtained from tail currents measured upon returning to −20 mV following 250 ms depolarizing pre-pulses from −80 to 50 mV in 10-mV steps (holding potential: −80 mV; 0.1 Hz). In the presence and absence of 10 nM MnTx-1, activation curves were generated by plotting normalized tail currents against pre-pulse potentials and fitting them to a Boltzmann function. Fractional inhibition (IMnTx1/ICtr) was calculated from peak currents recorded using the same I–V protocol.

Data and statistical analysis comply with recommendations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacology [94]. All data points in the peptide concentration-response curves on channels are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), withn= 4–8 for each concentration. IC50s are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A value ofp< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
