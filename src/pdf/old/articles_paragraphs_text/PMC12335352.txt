Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency with high mortality rates and a significant risk of complications. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as Gram staining, sometimes fail to identify the causative pathogen, and cultures take time to yield results. The FilmArray meningitis/encephalitis (ME) Panel, a molecular diagnostic tool, identifies 14 pathogens in approximately one hour. We report a case ofListeria monocytogenesmeningitis in a 79-year-old man, diagnosed using the FilmArray ME Panel after antibiotic exposure. The diagnosis was made on day seven, three days after admission, using a cerebrospinal fluid sample that had been stored due to the unavailability of the test over the weekend. Despite negative cultures, the panel facilitated diagnosis and effective treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin, leading to full recovery without sequelae. This case highlights the utility of the FilmArray ME Panel in challenging diagnostic scenarios and underscores the importance of ensuring its availability during after-hours and weekends to facilitate timely care in critical conditions.

Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency characterized by high mortality rates and a significant risk of long-term complications [1]. Among the various pathogens,Listeria monocytogenesis a relatively uncommon but important pathogen, especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients. It is typically acquired through contaminated food, such as unpasteurized dairy or processed meats, and accounts for approximately 9% of bacterial meningitis cases in individuals over 50 years of age [2]. Traditionally, the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis relies on Gram staining and culture. However, Gram staining sometimes fails to identify the causative pathogen, and culture takes time to yield results. Furthermore, the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain and culture is markedly reduced in patients who have received prior antibiotic therapy [3]. Recently, molecular diagnostic tools that allow a syndromic approach to meningitis/encephalitis (ME) diagnosis have become available. Since results can be obtained in about one hour, these methods have generated significant interest [4]. However, the FilmArray ME Panel is still a relatively new diagnostic tool, and there have been few reports of its successful use in diagnosingL. monocytogenesmeningitis following antibiotic exposure. Here, we present a case ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis in an elderly patient that was successfully diagnosed using the FilmArray ME Panel after the initiation of antibiotic treatment. The case highlights the importance of early molecular testing in cases of suspected bacterial meningitis and the need for improved accessibility of such diagnostics, particularly during off-hours.

A 79-year-old man with hypertension had traveled to Vietnam from nine days to two days before the onset of symptoms. The patient presented to a nearby hospital with a two-day fever and a one-day history of altered consciousness. His blood and urine tests and computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, chest, and pelvis were unremarkable. He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of the fever, and ceftriaxone was initiated. However, his fever and altered consciousness worsened. To broaden antimicrobial coverage for other possible pathogens, particularly Gram-negative rods and anaerobes, ceftriaxone was switched to piperacillin-tazobactam. He was transferred to our hospital on day four. There was no history of consuming cheese, cured meats such as prosciutto, or similar foods. Additionally, there was no family history of tuberculosis.

On arrival, the patient exhibited altered consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale: E4V4M6) but was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. No significant abnormalities were noted on physical examination. Rapid antigen tests for malaria and dengue fever were negative. CT scans of the head, chest, and pelvis showed no abnormalities (Figures1A-1C). Blood and urine cultures were also submitted at our hospital, and piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g) was continued. Due to progressive neurological deterioration overnight, the antibiotic was switched to meropenem 1 g, and empirical minocycline 200 mg was added. Although there was no clear episode of insect bites, rickettsial infection was considered a possible differential diagnosis, given the patient's recent travel to Vietnam, where rickettsial diseases are endemic. The lack of clinical response to prior antibiotics raised concern for pathogens not adequately covered, including Rickettsia species. Therefore, minocycline was added to cover possible rickettsial infections.

On illness day five, the patient's consciousness deteriorated to E3V3M3, and neck stiffness was noted. The blood test showed elevated inflammatory markers, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16,100 /μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 40.9 mg/dL, and a glucose level of 280 mg/dL (Table1). The CSF obtained by lumbar puncture (LP) was turbid (Figure2A), with an initial pressure of 370 mmH2O, WBC of 3,237/μL (82% neutrophils) (reference range: 0-5/μL), a decreased glucose level (101 mg/dL in CSF), and protein levels of 407 mg/dL (reference range: 10-40 mg/dL) (Table2). However, the Gram stain was negative. The negative Gram stain may have resulted from prior antibiotic treatment, which reduces bacterial load and impairs the sensitivity of conventional microbiological tests.

Based on these findings, bacterial meningitis was suspected, and treatment with meropenem 2 g every eight hours and dexamethasone 9.9 mg every six hours was initiated. As the FilmArray ME Panel test could not be performed due to the weekend, the cerebrospinal fluid sample was stored for later analysis. On day seven, stored CSF tested positive forL. monocytogenesusing the FilmArray ME Panel. This multiplex PCR assay provides results in approximately one hour and demonstrates high analytical sensitivity, with a lower limit of detection around 10³ CFU/mL for most bacterial targets. In comparison, conventional Gram stain and culture typically require higher bacterial loads - up to 10⁵ CFU/mL - and take 24-72 hours to yield results. While the FilmArray ME Panel shows sensitivities of 85% to nearly 100% depending on the pathogen, data forL. monocytogenesremain limited due to its rarity of positive cases in validation studies. The diagnosis ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis was made, and the antibiotic regimen was changed to intravenous ampicillin (2 g every four hours) and gentamicin (120 mg every eight hours). On the same day, the patient developed seizures. A consultation with the neurologist was made, and levetiracetam was initiated. However, as the seizures persisted, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Fosphenytoin sodium and midazolam were added, after which the seizures resolved. On day nine, blood tests showed improvement in inflammatory markers (Table1). A repeat LP performed on the same day revealed slightly turbid cerebrospinal fluid, with improved clarity compared to the initial CSF (Figure2B). The results showed a WBC of 498/μL, normal glucose, and protein levels of 460 mg/dL (Table2), demonstrating a favorable response to the targeted therapy. Consequently, gentamicin was discontinued. In addition, no other organisms were detected in the CSF cultures taken on day five, and dexamethasone was discontinued.

The fever and altered consciousness gradually improved. Fosphenytoin sodium and midazolam were discontinued, and oral levetiracetam was continued. On day 28, blood tests showed that inflammatory markers had nearly normalized (Table1). CSF analysis revealed a WBC of 18/μL, normal glucose levels, and a protein level of 109 mg/dL (Table2). This progressive normalization of CSF parameters correlated with the patient's clinical recovery. CSF cultures at our hospital and blood cultures from both hospitals did not yield any bacteria. CSF acid-fast bacilli culture and tuberculosis PCR were negative. The patient was treated with intravenous ampicillin for a total of three weeks, gentamicin for four days, and dexamethasone for four days for bacterial meningitis. The patient was discharged home on day 44 (Figure3). Upon discharge, the patient's Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised score was 25/30, with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction related to the illness.

This figure summarizes the key clinical events, antimicrobial treatments, diagnostic procedures, and neurological complications. Empiric therapy was escalated from ceftriaxone (CTRX) to piperacillin-tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ) and subsequently to meropenem (MEPM) and minocycline (MINO) due to worsening consciousness. A lumbar puncture (LP) performed on illness day five raised suspicion for bacterial meningitis, prompting an increased dose of MEPM and the initiation of dexamethasone (DEX). As the FilmArray meningitis/encephalitis (ME) Panel could not be performed over the weekend, the cerebrospinal fluid sample was stored. On illness day seven,Listeria monocytogeneswas identified by the ME panel, and targeted therapy with ampicillin (ABPC) and gentamicin (GM) was initiated. The patient experienced seizures on the day of diagnosis and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). By illness day nine, clinical and laboratory improvement was observed, and both GM and DEX were discontinued. The patient was discharged home without neurological sequelae on day 44.

We report a case ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis diagnosed using the FilmArray ME Panel in a patient with prior antibiotic exposure who fully recovered without any sequelae. This case highlights two key issues: first, the diagnostic value of the FilmArray ME Panel in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis who have already received antibiotics; and second, consistent access to the panel, including during weekends and nighttime hours, is crucial. In addition, this case underscores the importance of implementing hospital-wide protocols to ensure 24/7 accessibility to molecular diagnostics in critical care settings. Such policies could help prevent diagnostic delays and improve clinical outcomes.

L. monocytogenesis a Gram-positive bacillus and facultative intracellular bacterium, commonly present in the environment, including soil, vegetation, and animal reservoirs [5]. Listeriosis is considered one of the most common bacterial foodborne infections and is frequently transmitted through contaminated foods, such as dairy products and processed meats. The incubation period is approximately eight days (range: 1-67 days) [6]. While immunocompromised individuals, including cancer patients and those with HIV, are at high risk of infection, meningitis and sepsis can also occur in children and elderly individuals without underlying conditions.L. monocytogenesis responsible for approximately 9% of bacterial meningitis cases in individuals over 50 years of age and is a key pathogen in bacterial meningitis [2]. When neurological involvement occurs, the fatality rate can be as high as 30% [7]. Therefore, timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis are critically important. However, antibiotic pretreatment significantly reduces the sensitivity of the CSF Gram stain from 25.7% to 13.4%, and CSF culture from 66.1% to 48.5% [3], thereby making the diagnosis challenging.

Recently, the FilmArray ME Panel has gained attention for its ability to identify 14 common agents of community-acquired ME in about one hour. These agents includeEscherichia coliK1,Haemophilus influenzae,L. monocytogenes,Neisseria meningitidis,Streptococcus agalactiae,Streptococcus pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, human herpesvirus 6, human parechovirus, varicella-zoster virus, andCryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii.

Compared to conventional diagnostic methods, the FilmArray ME Panel has been shown to reduce the time to diagnosis of ME, the duration of antibiotic therapy, and the length of hospital stay [8]. However, there are no reported cases of its use in diagnosing patients who have received prior antibiotic treatment. In this case, the patient developedL. monocytogenesmeningitis after traveling to Vietnam; however, there was no suspicious dietary history, and the source of infection or its connection to the trip remains unclear. Due to prior antibiotic exposure, cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative. However, the FilmArray ME Panel enabled the diagnosis ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis, leading to a life-saving outcome without any neurological sequelae.

The impact of antibiotic treatment on the test performance of the FilmArray ME Panel has not been evaluated. In patients with prior antibiotic exposure, the sensitivity of CSF Gram staining typically requires a microbial load of 10⁵ CFU/mL or higher, whereas the FilmArray ME Panel has a minimum detection sensitivity of 10³ CFU/mL or higher [9]. This suggests that, in this patient, the microbial load in the CSF was below the detection threshold of Gram staining but above the detection threshold of the FilmArray ME Panel. These findings suggest that the FilmArray ME Panel may aid in diagnosing bacterial meningitis, even in patients with prior antibiotic exposure.

This case highlights the utility of the FilmArray ME Panel. However, at our hospital, the FilmArray ME Panel is performed by laboratory technicians in the microbiology department. Since microbiology technicians are unavailable during nighttime hours and weekends, and all laboratory technicians rotate shifts regardless of specialty, the FilmArray ME Panel could not be utilized during these times. In our case, CSF was collected over the weekend, preventing the use of the FilmArray ME Panel at that time. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, specimens may be stored at room temperature (approximately 23°C) for up to one day or refrigerated (approximately 4°C) for up to seven days [9]. In this case, the specimen was stored at 3°C for two days before undergoing analysis with the FilmArray ME Panel. As a result, the FilmArray ME Panel could not be performed on the same day, delaying the diagnosis ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis. Institutional policies and resource allocation should prioritize the establishment of around-the-clock availability of such molecular diagnostic platforms, particularly for patients in emergency or intensive care settings.

Despite its advantages, the FilmArray ME Panel has limitations. First, the impact of prior antibiotic treatment on the panel’s performance has not been fully evaluated. Second, although no false positives forL. monocytogeneshave been reported in previous studies, the organism was not detected at all, making it impossible to assess the test’s sensitivity for this particular pathogen [4]. Therefore, test results should always be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical context and other laboratory findings. A cautious and integrated diagnostic approach is essential to avoid misdiagnosis or delayed treatment.

This case illustrates the successful diagnosis ofL. monocytogenesmeningitis using the FilmArray ME Panel in a patient with prior antibiotic exposure. The patient made a full recovery without any neurological sequelae, highlighting the clinical value of early molecular diagnostics in suspected cases of bacterial meningitis, particularly when conventional methods may be unreliable.

To ensure timely diagnosis and optimal outcomes in life-threatening central nervous system infections, it is essential that healthcare systems implement protocols and allocate resources to provide 24/7 access to molecular diagnostics, including during nights and weekends. Broader adoption of such tools and infrastructure could enhance the speed and accuracy of meningitis diagnosis, especially in critical care settings.
