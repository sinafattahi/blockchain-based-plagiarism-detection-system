Reproductive efficiency is a crucial determinant of livestock productivity, with sperm quality being a key factor in successful fertilization. The quantitative assessment of spermatozoa using computer‐assisted sperm analysis (CASA) yields valuable kinetic variables that can vary across cattle breeds. This study aimed (i) to classify post‐thawed semen samples from Holstein, Simmental and Charolais bulls based on eight CASA‐derived variables, progressive motility (PM), non‐PM, velocity curve linear (VCL), velocity straight line (VSL), beat‐cross frequency (BCF), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), hyperactivity and velocity average path (VAP); (ii) to benchmark three tree‐based classifiers, C5.0, random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), for their ability to assign ejaculates to the correct breed; and (iii) to identify the most informative predictors for breed discrimination within the algorithms. We applied and compared the predictive performance of three tree‐based classification algorithms: C5.0, RF and SGB after the original dataset was randomly divided into the training and testing sets with 70%–30%, 75%–25% and 80%–20% ratios, respectively. Parameter tuning was carried out with the application of a 10‐fold cross‐validation technique with ten times repetition. The results showed that SGB achieved the highest performance for classification, with a mean balanced accuracy of 85.7% (86.4% for Holstein, 84.3% for Simmental and 86.5% for Charolais), followed by RF (83.5%) and C5.0 (73.5%). PM, hyperactivity and VSL were the most informative predictors. The results offer insights into breed‐specific sperm characteristics, with potential implications for the development of breed‐specific calibrations for CASA and ensure more efficient resource allocation in livestock production.

This study demonstrated that CASA‐derived sperm motility parameters can accurately classify cattle breeds using machine learning algorithms. Among the models tested, stochastic gradient boosting achieved the highest classification accuracy (86%), highlighting its potential for breed‐specific semen evaluation and AI optimization in cattle reproduction.

The reproductive performance of livestock is a critical factor in the productivity and sustainability of the livestock industry, particularly in the case of cattle breeding. Fertility rates, which are influenced by both male and female factors, are of critical importance for the growth of the herd and the genetic improvement of the livestock (Rodriguez‐Martinez2007). Among male fertility indicators, sperm quality is a key factor that directly affects the success of fertilization, artificial insemination (AI) and overall reproductive efficiency (Kastelic2013; David et al.2015; Mandawala et al.2018; Huang et al.2024).

The introduction of computer‐assisted sperm analysis (CASA) has transformed the field of reproductive biology through the provision of precise and objective measurements of sperm parameters (Nagy et al.2015). CASA allows for the evaluation of a range of sperm motility characteristics, including progressive movement, non‐progressive movement, velocity and other kinetic properties (Gòdia et al.2020), thereby facilitating more precise fertility predictions.

Spermatological traits exhibit considerable variation across cattle breeds. This is attributable to a combination of genetic differences, environmental factors and breeding management practices (Pardede et al.2020; Gacem et al.2021). Differences in sperm characteristics among cattle breeds have been well documented, with notable variations observed in traits such as volume and motility (Holt and van Look2004; Burren et al.2019; Seyoum et al.2021; Gupta et al.2022; Hossain et al.2022). The potential to evaluate and categorize breeds based on sperm quality parameters could facilitate the development of targeted breeding programmes that optimize reproductive efficiency. Furthermore, the identification of breed‐specific sperm characteristics could contribute to the targeted reproductive applications. This is particularly relevant in managing genetic diversity within and across breeds, ensuring the long‐term sustainability of livestock populations (Banks2023).

The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms is emerging as a powerful predictive tool for investigating the quality of sperm in animal breeding (Waberski et al.2022). Traditional methods for assessing sperm quality, such as visual analysis or basic statistical techniques, often fail to capture the complex, multivariate relationships between sperm parameters and fertility outcomes (Keller and Kerns2022). In contrast, ML algorithms are capable of processing large datasets and detecting intricate patterns in sperm quality measures, thereby enabling more precise classification of livestock breeds (Shanthini and Priscila2022; Tu et al.2022). ML models, such as LASSO and gradient boosting regression, have shown significant potential in predicting and classifying livestock breeds based on sperm quality traits (Hürland et al.2023). The use of different models has also been applied to predict the early identification of highly fertile cattle (Reis et al.2024) and to predict success of conception in dairy cows (Hempstalk et al.2015), as well as to assess the fertilizing capacity of ejaculates from boars (Kuhlgatz et al.2019), bucks (Piles et al.2013), rats (Pereira et al.2019) and humans (Gil et al.2012). To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has employed tree‐based ML algorithms, such as stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), for the purpose of classifying breeds on the basis of sperm quality data.

In this study, we focused on three objectives: (i) to establish breed‐specific profiles based on a range of spermatological parameters gathered from CASA in Holstein, Simmental and Charolais bulls; (ii) to develop and compare performances of three tree‐based classification ML algorithms, C5.0, random forest (RF) and SGB, for their ability to assign ejaculates to the correct breed, Holstein, Simmental and Charolais, on the basis of CASA variables; and (iii) to determine which CASA variables drive predictive success by examining algorithm‐specific importance ranking. Taken together, these objectives integrate sperm characteristics with comparative ML assessment to inform both fundamental understanding of breed‐related patterns and the practical deployment of CASA‐based predictive models in reproductive management.

A total of 542 commercially produced semen samples from Simmental (n= 200), Holstein (n= 200) and Charolais (n= 142) breeds were analysed at Andrology Reference Laboratory, Department of Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ankara University, using a CASA device. The commercially sourced semen samples (cryopreserved with non‐milk‐based extenders) and only batches meeting standardized post‐thaw quality criteria were included, and all laboratory procedures were rigorously controlled. (According to national regulatory standards for semen evaluation, only samples meeting CASA‐specific thresholds of ≥40% total motility, ≥50% live spermatozoa and ≥5 million motile spermatozoa per straw were selected for inclusion.) All ejaculates were cryopreserved using non‐milk‐based extenders, consistent with studies evaluating extender efficacy on post‐thaw sperm quality (Maleki et al.2023). Semen samples (0.25 mL and containing approximately 11–14 million spermatozoa) were thawed using a water bath at 37°C for 30 s. After thawing, a 5 µL semen sample was placed on a pre‐warmed slide and covered with a coverslip (22 mm × 22 mm). The semen samples were then analysed using the CASA Sperm Class Analyzer (SCA v.4.2, Barcelona, Spain) by obtaining consecutive and digitalized photographic images in a 60‐frame‐per‐second time‐lapse. For each semen sample, five microscopic fields were analysed at 10× magnification. The CASA analysis was performed using predefined settings to classify sperm motility subpopulations. Threshold values included a head area range of 10–70 µm2, immotility defined as <10 µm/s, slow‐medium motility <30 µm/s and rapid motility >60 µm/s. Progressive motility (PM) was defined by a straightness (STR) ≥75%. Additional parameters, such as connectivity (12 pixels), velocity average path (VAP) smoothing (5 pixels) and classification based on the velocity curve linear (VCL)/VAP ratio, were also applied. In the analyses, motility (M), PM, VCL, velocity straight line (VSL), VAP, linearity (LIN), straightness (STR), wobble (WOB), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), beat‐cross frequency (BCF) and hyperactivity (hyper) parameters were determined (Tırpan et al.2022). Each sample underwent comprehensive analysis to assess post‐thaw sperm quality parameters.

In this study, three different tree‐based algorithms were employed. C5.0 was selected as the single tree‐based classifier. SGB and RF were selected as tree‐based ensemble learning methods, with SGB belonging to the boosting family, which builds trees sequentially so that each new tree corrects errors made by its predecessors, and RF to the bagging family, which grows many trees in parallel on bootstrap samples to reduce variance.

All eight CASA variables were complete (0% missing) and showed no extreme outliers (|z| > 3.0). All variables were mean‐centred, and no variance scaling was applied to preserve native units through model training. The original dataset was randomly divided into the training and testing sets with 70%–30%, 75%–25% and 80%–20% ratios, respectively. The training set is employed for the purpose of training the models, whereas the test set is utilized for the evaluation of the examined models and the comparison of their performance. Although numerous settings can be utilized with each ML algorithm, the optimal configuration is selected on the basis of parameter tuning, which provides the parameter set with the most accurate prediction on the training set. The parameter tuning process involves the application of the 10‐fold cross‐validation technique on the training set, with each iteration occurring 10 times. In each iteration, 10‐fold cross‐validation is applied by splitting the training data into 10 equal folds. Each fold is used as a validation set for the trained model, whereas the remaining folds are used for training. Relative variable importance values of the classifiers offering the highest performance are also provided. These values indicate which variables significantly impact the model performance and its predictions (Kuhn and Johnson2013; Schonlau and Zou2020).

All calculations were performed with R version 4.2.2 using R Studio (version: 2022.07.2+576) (R Core Team2022). The R package Caret (Classification and Regression Training) was employed for the training of the models for each examined classifier (Kuhn et al.2020).

The comparison metrics are derived from a confusion matrix comprising two dimensions. One dimension represents the actual class of an observation, whereas the other represents the class predicted by the classifier. Metrics for binary classification are calculated for each class using a 2 × 2 confusion matrix. We then calculated the following performance metrics for the model: accuracy, balanced accuracy (BA), precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), kappa andF1 scores (Özen et al.2024).

Descriptive statistics of all quantitative variables were given as mean ± standard deviation and/or median (minimum–maximum) values. The data were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test and homogeneity of variances using the Levene test. One‐way ANOVA for parameters that hold parametric test assumptions and Kruskal–Wallis tests for parameters that violate parametric test assumptions were employed to assess differences of sperm parameters among breeds. Gabriel and Dunn's tests were used as post hoc procedures, respectively. A probability value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Descriptive statistics and the univariate differences of sperm parameters classified by breed are presented in Table1. The analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the breeds for all variables, except VCL and VAP parameters. Upon analysis of the parameters, it was observed that the lowest progressive and non‐PM measurements were found in the Holstein and Charolais breeds, respectively. For the VSL and BCF variables, where significant differences were identified, the highest measurements were observed in the Charolais breed. The highest hyperactivity measurement was observed in the Simmental breed (Table1).

The results of the repeated 10‐fold cross‐validation demonstrated that the highest overall accuracy level was achieved when the data were separated into training and test datasets with a ratio of 80%–20% (Figure1). For every split, SGB achieved the highest mean BA (80:20 = 0.821 ± 0.046; 75:25 = 0.813 ± 0.045; 70:30 = 0.807 ± 0.048), followed closely by RF (80:20 = 0.813 ± 0.043, 75:25 = 0.801 ± 0.050, 70:30 = 0.808 ± 0.048) and more distantly by C5.0 (80:20 = 0.786 ± 0.052, 75:25 = 0.773 ± 0.061, 70:30 = 0.781 ± 0.056). All three models benefited from a larger training pool, as the 80:20 split yielded a performance gain over the 70:30 split, although the differences lay within one standard deviation, indicating that the improvements were modest relative to fold‐to‐fold variability. RF displayed the narrowest dispersion, consistent with the variance‐reduction effect of bagging, whereas C5.0 showed the greatest dispersion, corroborating its lower stability.

The test set metrics obtained for each train–test split are summarized in Table2. Consistently, the 80:20 partition delivered the highest overall performance in most of the metrics across all models. When evaluated on the independent 20% test set, SGB reached a BA of 0.857, RF 0.835 and C5.0 0.715, confirming hierarchy with the internal validation results (Table2). Both ensemble methods generalizing slightly above their cross‐validated means and remained within the ±1 SD of those estimates, confirming good external validity and no sign of over‐fitting (Figure1). In all metrics utilized for comparative analysis, as reported in Table2, SGB retained the numerically best classification performance, followed by RF and C5.0.

Abbreviations: AUC, area under the curve; NPV, negative predictive value; PPV, positive predictive value.

Per‐breed confusion matrices are presented in Table3. According to Table3, both ensemble methods, SGB and RF, markedly out‐performed C5.0 for all three breeds. SGB misclassified only eight Holstein and seven Charolais ejaculates, whereas C5.0 produced more than double that number for each breed. The breed‐specific confusion patterns noted in Table3are quantified in the per‐breed metrics of Table4, where SGB attained the highest BA for Simmental (88.5%), Holstein (84.2%) and Charolais (84.4%). Other metrics such as precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) values also supported this hierarchy. Moreover, the higherF1‐scores recorded for SGB indicated that the ensemble not only captured a larger share of true positives but also maintained a low false‐positive rate, corroborating the reduced misclassification counts observed in Table3.

Variable importance profiles for each classifier are presented in Figure2. Results showed that all three models generated different importance values for each variable. VSL emerged as the most important variable in both C5.0 and RF models, whereas PM ranked first in the SGB model. Hyperactivity consistently ranked second in all three algorithms, indicating a stable and substantial contribution to breed classification. BCF received negligible importance (<3%) across all models. For the best performing predictive classifier, SGB, the most influential variables ordered by relative importance were PM, hyperactivity, VSL, ALH, VAP, non‐PM, VCL and BCF.

This study demonstrated that tree‐based ML algorithms can utilize complex, breed‐specific kinematic data in post‐thaw semen for accurate classification. Across 542 ejaculates from Holstein, Simmental and Charolais bulls, SGB produced the best mean BA, followed by RF and C5.0 algorithms. In this study, the multivariate patterns corresponded closely with the univariate comparisons. Univariate analysis indicated that Charolais bulls exhibited the highest mean VSL and BCF, whereas Simmental ejaculates showed the greatest hyperactivity and ALH, with VCL and VAP differing minimally among breeds. Moreover, progressive motility values were significantly lower in Holstein than Simmental and Charolais. These breed‐specific kinematic patterns mapped directly onto the variable importance rankings, as both C5.0 and RF assigned maximal importance to VSL, whereas SGB prioritized PM and ranked hyperactivity as second. In contrast, BCF contributed modestly, whereas VCL and VAP exhibited only a minor contribution to ML models. Together, these results demonstrated that the ML classifiers effectively utilize the similar variables that differ univariately among breeds, with SGB proving the most adept at integrating those CASA‐derived variables into accurate, breed‐level predictions. Specifically, SGB misclassified only 7 of 28 Charolais and 8 of 40 Holstein ejaculates, whereas both RF and C5.0 incurred higher error rates across breeds. These findings collectively underscore PM, VSL and hyperactivity as the most influential variables for breed classification in bovine semen, positioning SGB as the most effective classifier for integrating these CASA‐derived variables.

The evaluation of sperm quality concerning breed specificity is important for optimizing AI protocols, improving fertility rates and conserving genetic diversity. By incorporating breed‐specific findings into AI workflows, breeders can enhance herd fertility, increase fertilization success and reduce the proportion of non‐breeding animals. In this study, Charolais samples exhibited higher VSL and BCF. It was also demonstrated that Simmental ejaculates displayed markedly elevated hyperactivity and ALH values, although the latter was not statistically different from Holstein ejaculates, reflecting their poorer freezing potential. Increased hyperactivity and ALH may reflect greater membrane flexibility and capacitation potential, which in turn influence sperm resilience during cryopreservation and transit through the female reproductive tract (Comizzoli and Holt2022; Suarez and Ho2003). This interpretation is reinforced by findings in Simmental bulls, where co‐supplementation with the antioxidant rutin improved post‐thaw kinetic parameters, suggesting that the observed hyperactivity corresponds to enhanced membrane pliability (Farjami et al.2024). These findings suggest that certain kinetic and motility‐related metrics are more indicative of breed variations than others and have important implications for semen cryopreservation. Shojaei et al. (2012) showed post‐thaw VSL and BCF correlated significantly with adjusted non‐return rates in Holstein AI bulls. Higher VSL and BCF are positively associated with post‐thaw motility persistence and rapid progression through the female reproductive tract (Watson2000) and also with improved fertility in beef and dairy cattle (Hoflack et al.2007), whereas increased hyperactivity and ALH, when observed before freezing, often reflect a membrane fluidity that confers resistance to cold shock (Comizzoli and Holt2022). Consequently, semen from Charolais bulls may require only standard cryopreservation protocols, whereas Simmental semen could benefit from extenders enriched with membrane stabilisers or antioxidants to capitalize on its intrinsic motility potential. Evidence for this approach comes from buffalo–bull studies showing that antioxidants, such asl‐proline plus fulvic acid and caffeic acid, lessen oxidative stress and improve post‐thaw semen quality, underscoring the value of breed‐tailored antioxidant supplementation (Soleimanzadeh et al.2020; Ramazani et al.2023). This observation aligns with the research by Hicks et al. (2019), which found that ML‐based tracking algorithms reveal kinetic parameters critical for understanding freezing resilience in semen samples. Tailoring cooling rates, cryoprotectant concentrations and insemination doses to these breed‐specific kinematic profiles is, therefore, expected to maximize post‐thaw viability and pregnancy rates. Although the present study does not directly measure fertility outcomes or pregnancy rates and is focused only on kinematic classification, translating CASA‐derived patterns into real‐world fertility outcomes remains an important next step. For instance, studies using post‐thawed epididymal sperm from spotted buffaloes have demonstrated that higher proportions of rapid and progressively motile cells predicted better pregnancy outcomes (Yulnawati et al.2013). Additionally, supplementation of Simmental bull semen extenders with the antioxidant ferulic acid not only enhanced post‐thaw CASA motility indices but also improved in vivo fertility (Afsar et al.2024), suggesting a mechanistic link between sperm kinematics and fertilization potential. Future studies should, therefore, aim to calibrate breed‐specific CASA thresholds directly against AI success to establish actionable parameters for semen selection and extender optimization.

Many measurements such as PM and hyperactivity have been linked to effective sperm transport and fertilization success (Butler et al.2020; Suarez and Ho2003). Moreover, breed‐specific differences in total and PM, as well as kinetic efficiency of spermatozoa were encountered for cattle in various studies (Hoflack et al.2007,2006; Ntemka et al.2016; Surahman et al.2021). In this study, PM, hyperactivity, VSL, ALH, VAP, non‐PM, VCL and BCF were identified as influential variables in the SGB algorithm for breed‐classification purposes. Although traditional statistical methods did not reveal significant differences between breeds for VCL and VAP, these variables were identified as essential contributors by the SGB algorithm. This finding underscores the efficacy of ML algorithms in undercovering subtle, multi‐faceted patterns within interconnected datasets (James et al.2013). By effectively integrating VCL and VAP into predictive models, ML approaches demonstrate their superiority over conventional methods in assessing multivariate datasets and detecting complex biological relationships.

In the present study, SGB, an ensemble algorithm, proved to be the most successful classifier, surpassing both RF and C5.0. SGB's repetitive learning process generates a chain of decision trees that rectify previous errors, resulting in better performance (Friedman2001,2002; Hastie et al.2009). The adaptability of SGB, combined with its capacity to concentrate on misclassified instances, probably enhanced its classification precision. Although classification‐based ML algorithms, such as RF and C5.0, are frequently used in different fields of veterinary medicine in the literature, the number of studies using SGB is quite limited. Comizzoli and Holt (2022) emphasized how robust ensemble methods can optimize cryopreservation and enhance genetic conservation outcomes, particularly for endangered species. However, one study, Ogutu et al. (2011), compared SGB and RF and showed that SGB had better prediction accuracy than RF for estimating genomic breeding values, which is comparable with the findings of this study. In this study, SGB achieved the highest accuracy; the random‐forest algorithm remained competitive by training faster, requiring fewer tuning parameters, and being less sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. This makes it a more accessible option for breeders and researchers seeking a compromise between performance and ease of implementation, especially when the computational demands or tuning requirements of SGB are not feasible. On the other hand, the C5.0 algorithm had the least efficacy in categorizing cattle breeds based on CASA‐derived sperm characteristics in this study. As a single‐tree model, C5.0 is inherently less adaptive than ensemble methods such as RF and SGB (Özen et al.2024). Although it succeeds in providing interpretable and simple decision rules, its dependence on a single decision tree limits its ability to model complex relationships among variables specific to biological data, unlike ensemble methods like SGB and RF that aggregate multiple trees (Chlis et al.2020). In this study, the C5.0 algorithm had difficulties in modelling the complex interactions among sperm parameters, resulting in reduced accuracy compared to the other two algorithms.

As livestock management increasingly incorporates ML techniques, robust analytical frameworks are required to process the large, heterogeneous datasets generated by contemporary breeding programmes (Nayeri et al.2019). Tree‐based algorithms demonstrated notable efficacy in such tasks due to their capacity to handle low‐ and high‐dimensional data while elucidating the significance of various variables. The results of this study also confirm this advantage, as the boosting ensemble achieved a test set BA higher than RF and C5.0, while cutting Charolais misclassifications by one‐third. Comparable advantages have been reported in bull‐fertility research, where a multicolour flow‐cytometry–RF model correctly assigned two‐thirds of ejaculates to high‐ or low‐fertility groups (Bucher et al.2019), and in genomic prediction, where SGB out‐performed RF and support‐vector machines for estimating genomic breeding values (Ogutu et al.2011). ML‐based sperm analysis, such as the DeepFert framework for human fertility prediction, has previously shown that combining biological data with neural networks improves predictive accuracy (Naseem et al.2023). For sperm motility assessment, deep‐learning approaches also showed potential; a ResNet‐50 convolutional neural network (CNN) matched expert assessments of WHO motility categories (Trine et al.2023), and our variable importance profiles highlighted the same kinematic cues, PM and VSL, as dominant predictors. Similarly, Hicks et al. (2019) emphasized how CNNs enhance sperm motility evaluation, providing critical insights into CASA‐derived data integration. Among the tested algorithms, SGB emerged as the most accurate, achieving a BA of 85.70%, surpassing RF (83.50%) and C5.0 (73.49%), similar to the findings of this study. Beyond phenotypic traits, ML approaches also show promise for genetic inference, but their application to CASA data is complicated by inherent biological variability. Notably, Panner Selvam et al. (2024) highlighted that ML models combining CASA‐derived variables with genetic data could improve sperm quality predictions by uncovering population‐level markers. RF algorithm identified population‐informative SNPs in seven Italian pig breeds (Schiavo et al.2020), in 23 European pig breeds (Schiavo et al.2024), and extreme‐gradient‐boosting panels achieved 99% genomic‐based breed‐classification accuracy in cattle (Cho et al.2022; Gao et al.2022), deriving a higher accuracy than this study. ML applications expand beyond genetic analysis to include image classification methods for breed identification. Computer vision pipelines for livestock identification such as the ensemble detector mentioned by Vijayalakshmi et al. (2024) underscore the versatility of ensemble learning, whereas classical boosting variants such as AdaBoost attained elevated accuracy rates in classification tests of biomedical data (Doganer2021). These multi‐modal successes suggest that coupling our CASA‐based SGB model with genomic or image features could further enhance breed classification.

Despite the encouraging results yielded by this study, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of several limitations, as they underscore the necessity for future research on this topic and improvements to the methodology employed. This study was limited to three specific breeds: Holstein, Simmental and Charolais, which, although commercially significant, do not fully capture the genetic diversity of cattle populations. Future research should expand the scope to include indigenous, rare and other breeds to validate the generalizability of ML models. Additionally, external (diet, health and environment) and internal factors (age, reproductive organ function and individual differences), which were not explicitly controlled in this study, may have influenced the results. In addition, integrating multi‐modal inputs such as genomic markers or morphological imaging with multi‐laboratory validation may further enhance classification robustness across genetically heterogeneous populations and confirm reproducibility, leveraging standardized CASA protocols (Pathak et al.2020).

Although these limitations are noteworthy, it is important to note that they do not detract from the overall contributions of this study. Rather, they offer potential avenues for future research to enhance the reliability, applicability and biological understanding of ML‐based approaches in livestock management. Addressing these challenges will further establish ML as a transformative tool for improving reproductive efficiency and conserving genetic diversity in cattle populations.

This study demonstrated that CASA‐derived sperm variables, when analysed with ML algorithms, provide a reliable means of breed classification in bovine semen. SGB, correctly assigned 86% of the ejaculates, outperforming RF and C5.0 models, on the basis of key indicators, such as VSL, PM and hyperactivity. By addressing challenges in traditional methods, ML models offer transformative approach to achieving accurate and objective sperm assessments, with broad implications for livestock management, conservation and breeding efficiency. Future research should focus on expanding the applicability of this method to other species and contexts, thereby enhancing its utility in various practical settings.
