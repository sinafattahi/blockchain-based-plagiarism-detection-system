Hemodialysis shift handoff entails intricate communication on chronic kidney disease profiles, treatment frequency, and advanced technology. Communication lapses among professionals during handoffs can lead to incidents and adverse events, risking patient outcomes. The frequency of handoffs and nurses attending to multiple patients necessitate extensive record-keeping(1). Communication breakdowns, accounting for 70% of healthcare errors, significantly jeopardize patient safety(2). These issues frequently stem from disorganized routines within healthcare teams, fostering impersonal communication environments(3). A descriptive study in a private hospital’s hemodialysis service in southern Brazil correlated hypoglycemia cases with communication failures(4). Moreover, in Goiania, Brazil, a cross-sectional study identified illegible hemodialysis prescriptions as the cause of 80% of communication failures(5).

Communication is integral to the care process, particularly during shift handoffs between healthcare professionals. A 2021 systematic review emphasized that inadequate handoffs are linked to various risks, including information omissions, diagnostic errors, and treatment mistakes(6). In hemodialysis clinics, transferring responsibilities between nursing teams is crucial due to treatment complexity, advanced technology use, and the need to manage patient profiles efficiently amid heavy workloads. In the US, a study showed that only 39% of nurses consider handoffs safe(7). A study in Germany suggested that training is needed to improve communication; it found that safe communication training reduced preventable adverse events by 33.9%(8).

Effective healthcare communication encompasses verbal exchanges, documentation, and handoffs. It must be objective, clear, and standardized to maintain crucial information for safe continuity of care(9). Nurses, as team leaders and caregivers, are pivotal in ensuring patient safety during handoffs. This intricate process demands sufficient time and well-planned strategies, including education and support, to prevent omissions or inadequate communication that could endanger patients(10).

Transferring patient responsibilities in hemodialysis clinics faces challenges due to lacking standardized tools and inadequate investment in ongoing education(11). This can result in ineffective communication, risking patient safety. Identifying and addressing these flaws is crucial to ensure clear, standardized, and error-free information transfer, ultimately enhancing patient safety.

Implementing patient safety goals is one-way hospitals can adopt to improve the quality of their medical care. The six patient safety goals are: lowering the risk of infection associated with health measures; improving communication; increasing medicine safety; ensuring precise location, exact procedures, and exact patient during surgery; and lowering the risk of patient falls. Hospitals can evaluate patient safety goals and practices to identify and address safety issues that are relevant to day-to-day operations in hemodialysis units(12).

Many adverse events occur due to the lack of optimal implementation of patient safety goals. The adoption of these goals in a hemodialysis unit is often considered less than ideal, as it is influenced by several factors, resulting in a high incidence of adverse events. Among the main causes are communication failures, both among healthcare professionals and between patients and their companions, which compromises patient safety. Furthermore, ineffective communication is noted to be one of the causes of 70% of errors committed in healthcare. This problem has been attributed to the daily routine of the healthcare team, as a disorganized routine contributes to transforming the care environment into a space in which communication becomes mechanized and impersonal(13).

An in-depth investigation of the patient transfer process is needed to analyze communication patterns among nursing teams and reveal weaknesses in handoff practices that endanger patient safety. By exploring the theme and going through the steps to achieve the study objective, we seek to develop technological management tools that assist in the process of handover of the nursing team in hemodialysis clinics.

To explore patient handoff practices among nursing teams in hemodialysis clinics.

The study received approval from the Committee of Ethics in Human Research, aligning with ethical standards outlined in Brazilian Resolutions 466/12 and 510/16, safeguarding participants’ right to informed consent. His research was submitted for ethical assessment by the Federal University of Ceara and received an approved opinion on February 27, 2023. All participants were fully informed about the study’s purpose, procedures, and potential risks, and provided written consent before participation. Anonymity was ensured by identifying participants with the letters “NT” for nursing technicians and “N” for nurses, followed by interview sequence numbers. Participation was voluntary, and participants had the right to withdraw at any point without repercussions.

Exploratory qualitative study. The study followed COREQ(14)guidelines during design and execution.Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research (COREQ) checklist for qualitative research. Regarding reflexivity, the researchers worked on collecting data in the field, in the critical analysis of statements associated with the interviewee’s behavior, in the critical analysis of the material collected to then make inferences about the results found.

Conducted from April to June 2022, it involved six hemodialysis clinics in five health regions of Ceará, Brazil, chosen for their high patient volume and diverse contexts. The sample was convenience-based, non-probabilistic, and non-random, drawn from available survey responses. The study included 44 nursing professionals (nurses and nursing technicians), who were selected based on their minimum of 6 months’ experience in hemodialysis clinics. Exclusion criteria included professionals not actively working during data collection.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, where participants were provided with an interview script comprising sociodemographic and work-related questions, as well as inquiries regarding communication within the nursing team and shift handoff details. Additional questions covered safe care, patient safety training, and evaluations of communication and care safety levels. The instrument underwent evaluation and approval by three judges, experts in patient safety, to ensure clarity and relevance of questions. Data were collected at the participants’ workplace.

Two female lead authors, experienced qualitative researchers, specialist nurses, a doctoral student, and a master’s student, who were unfamiliar with the participants, conducted interviews in private rooms at hemodialysis clinics, with only the researcher and the participant present. After the study objectives were presented, participants were accommodated with minimal interruption. The interviews, which lasted approximately 30 minutes each, were audio-recorded on mobile phones and transcribed verbatim. Participants validated the information at the conclusion of the interview. No pilot testing was conducted, and interviews continued until theoretical data saturation was reached.

After writing the results and presenting them to the committee of the institution where the research originated, the final product of the study was sent via email to the coordinators of the research scenarios, as feedback on the discussions held during the investigation.

The data were organized using IRaMuTeQ®0.7 Alpha 2.3.3.1 software, which employs Hierarchical Descendant Classification (HDC) analysis. HDC groups segments based on the chisquare test into classes displayed visually in a dendrogram created using IRaMuTeQ. This facilitated researchers’ access to contextually significant words for qualitative data analysis through interpretation(15).

Following data analysis in IRaMuTeQ, four themes/classes were identified and labeled as follows: (Class 1) “Information communicated during patient handoff,” (Class 2) “Failures in patient handoff,” (Class 3) “Communication-enabling technologies,” and (Class 4) “Nursing team’s perceptions on patient handoff”.

The communication among nurses during the transfer of patient responsibilities primarily occurs through the clinic’s shift report book, where relevant information from the shift, such as incidents and observations, is recorded.

The nurses reported that it is not feasible to perform the shift handoff individually for each client, as approximately 40 patients are entrusted to a single professional.

One of the participating nurses in the study announced that the shift handoff takes place via phone call, given that the professionals work at the clinic on alternating days and adhere to a 12-hour work routine.

Most nursing technicians stated that they perform the transfer of care individually for each patient.

One of the main vital signs communicated by healthcare professionals, especially nursing technicians, during the shift handoff is blood pressure (BP).

The participants stated that they also communicated about any occurrences and interventions during their shift handoff.

Another important data in hemodialysis renal replacement therapy is weight, which must be assessed before and after each session. Moreover, this information is used to calculate the dry weight (ideal hydration level weight) and, thus, determine the most suitable therapeutic approach for the patient.

The professionals also pass on information about prescribed medications, including those that have already been administered, those for home use, and those used in the hemodialysis system.

Nurse technicians affirmed that they provide all the necessary data to the professional taking over the care, including information required for programming the hemodialysis machine, such as the ultrafiltration rate (UF) and dialysis time.

Though Class 1, we explored specific details shared about information communicated during patient handoff and how they are conveyed, shedding light on the critical elements of effective communication in patient handoff. Class 2 investigates the various shortcomings and challenges that can occur during the patient handoff process.

The participants mentioned failures related to the prescribed medications for the patients during the hemodialysis session.

The participants also reported that they forget important data that needs to be communicated during the transfer of care, primarily due to the lack of standardization regarding what should be conveyed and the insufficient time available for the shift handoff.

The nursing professionals mentioned that the patients have been under the care of the same nursing team for a considerable period, leading to the belief that it is unnecessary to communicate all information during the transfer of care, particularly patient identification data.

Class 2 examined the instances where communication breaks down, misunderstandings arise, or critical information is omitted, providing insight into the areas where improvements are needed to enhance patient safety. Class 3 explores the role of technology in facilitating patient handoffs.

The nurses and nursing technicians in the study emphasized the efficiency of using radios for communication, especially when physically distant from each other, such as during patient transfers. Radios enable quick and convenient information exchange, complemented by telephone availability.

Two hemodialysis clinics have implemented an individual patient identification system, which consists of plates placed at each patient’s bedside, displaying information such as name, gender, age, prescribed medications, and patient risks.

In one of the settings, the nurse reported that the team utilizes social media platforms such as WhatsApp to facilitate communication among the nursing staff.

The participants affirmed that they use medical records for recording and tracking the information communicated during the transfer of care.

The nursing teams reported that standardizing the data to be communicated during the transfer of care would prevent patient safety failures.

Class 3 delved into the use of communication tools, electronic health records, and other technological advancements that supported the transfer of patient information, highlighting their impact on the efficiency and quality of handoffs. Class 4 examines the perceptions and experiences of nursing teams.

The participants affirmed the need for improvement in communication among the nursing team during the transfer of patient responsibility.

Nursing professionals reported that simultaneous involvement in multiple tasks by their colleagues impedes communication during patient handoffs. This challenge arises from the limited time available to convey essential information effectively.

The quotes gathered in Class 4 uncovered how healthcare professionals viewed the patient handoff process, their attitudes, concerns, and suggestions, ultimately providing a deeper understanding of the human element in this critical aspect of healthcare delivery.

The study findings reveal various issues with nurse handoffs in hemodialysis clinics, impacting treatment and patient outcomes. These include incomplete communication of vital information like blood pressure, weight, incidents, and machine settings; failures in medication adherence and omission of crucial data; and varied communication methods, including technology use such as social media, phones, and radios in certain clinics.

Our study emphasizes the significance of monitoring blood pressure during hemodialysis and underscores its critical role in patient handoffs. Previous literature has demonstrated the impact of hemodialysis on patients’ blood pressure(16). For instance, research conducted in Thessaloniki, Greece, established a notable link between heightened blood pressure variability during hemodialysis and cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease patients(17). Communicating accurate blood pressure information during handoffs is essential to averting medical errors and improving patient outcomes.

During shift changes, the nursing team exchanges patient weight data, encompassing pre-hemodialysis, dry weight, and post-hemodialysis measurements. Research from Sweden has correlated interdialytic weight gain with cardiac issues and elevated mortality rates among hemodialysis patients(18). Precise determination of dry weight is paramount for optimizing dialysis, reducing cardiovascular strain, and enhancing survival rates among individuals with chronic kidney disease(19). Hence, ensuring the accurate transmission of verified weight information is crucial for the safety of dialysis patients.

During patient handoff, the nursing team communicates any encountered issues during hemodialysis. Dialysis patients frequently experience complications such as intradialytic hypotension, muscle cramps, nausea, and fatigue, significantly impacting their quality of life (as shown in a case series study in Turkey)(20). Although serious complications like gas embolism or vascular access bleeding are rare, they can increase mortality risks(21). Sharing these session events is vital for patient safety and enhancing prognosis.

During shift changes, the nursing team discusses hemodialysis machine settings, focusing on the ultrafiltration (UF) rate, crucial for patient survival. High weight-adjusted UF rates can lower blood pressure and increase cardiovascular mortality risk(22). Interestingly, a study also found that obese individuals have a protective lower UF rate per weight compared to those with lower weight(23). Hence, accurate communication of data for machine settings is vital to enhance care quality. However, lapses in communicating these settings during handoffs pose risks to patients, underscoring the need for precise communication to tailor settings and improve care quality.

Medication information is routinely exchanged during patient handoffs. A cross-sectional study in Jordan revealed that a majority of hemodialysis patients encountered medication-related issues, which escalated with age and number of medications(24). This underscores the importance of vigilance when discussing prescriptions and medication administration for dialysis patients, given the high incidence of treatment-related problems in this vulnerable population.

Nursing professionals noted frequent forgetfulness during shift handoffs, attributing it to a lack of data standardization. An integrative review of 13 studies in 2021 revealed that a nursing handoff checklist ensures standardized performance, enhancing continuity of care and patient safety(1). This highlights the potential of communication tools like checklists to improve the quality of care in hemodialysis.

The study highlights technology’s critical role in improving care team communication, emphasizing the use of radios and social media. Mobile technologies streamline tasks for nurses, stressing the need for investing in communication resources to prevent adverse events in hemodialysis clinics(25). Participants recognize the urgent need for better communication within nursing teams. Literature also underscores improved communication among healthcare professionals to reduce adverse events and enhance care quality.

This study benefits from extensive geographic coverage, spanning six clinics across five diverse regions, enhancing the representativeness and generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the relatively large sample size enriches the dataset’s diversity, capturing various perspectives and enhancing the depth and breadth of qualitative analysis. However, limitations include relatively short interview durations, potentially compromising data depth and detail. Conducting research in a workplace setting may introduce biases or conversational constraints, warranting careful consideration of its impact. A randomized clinical trial in Barcelona, Spain, demonstrated that training nurses through role-playing enhances information sharing among the team and increases awareness of their roles and responsibilities(26).

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of one health region in Ceará. However, data from participants in other scenarios accurately depict patient handoff in hemodialysis clinics across the state.

The results of this study can strengthen the replication of further research on patient safety in dialysis, enriching the knowledge base and proposing tailored care strategies for diverse contexts nationwide. Additionally, these findings can inform the advancement of management technologies utilized in the care team’s handoff process.

Communication is a fundamental aspect among the nursing team and for patient safety in hemodialysis units. However, there are communication failures among the nursing team regarding patient information in hemodialysis, considering that the information relayed consists of complications and vital signs, mainly blood pressure. Other information such as medications is often forgotten to be communicated, mainly due to the lack of standardized instruments for information transfer. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate into clinical practice the use of communication means that strengthen patient safety and ensure the transfer of all information among healthcare professionals.

In the examined clinical settings, shift handoff communication predominantly utilizes printed materials and verbal exchanges. Nonetheless, apprehensions regarding medication safety persist due to the inherent difficulties associated with forgetfulness, multitasking, busy work environments, and rapid shift turnovers. Effective communication during handoffs is facilitated by adequate time allocation for meticulous exchange and the utilization of technology to streamline the transmission of information. These observations emphasize the imperative for standardized handoff protocols and comprehensive training initiatives aimed at enhancing patient safety and optimizing communication within care teams.
