Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are on the rise and have become a significant global public health issue. Mitochondrial function and biogenesis in visceral adipose tissue are key factors influencing the development of obesity and related metabolic disorders. In addition, chronic inflammation involving immune cells can lead to obesity-related metabolic disorders. Given these underlying mechanisms, we aimed to test whether the treatment of frozen-thawed isolated mitochondrial preparations (MRC-Q) from cultured cells had a protective effect on adipose tissue inflammation and remodeling in a high-fat diet-induced mouse model.

MRC-Q was given intraperitoneally every 2 weeks to the mice in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. The results demonstrated that MRC-Q reduced the amount of adipose tissue and the body weight of the DIO mice, reduced blood glucose, and improved glucose tolerance. This process was accompanied by M2 macrophage polarization and suppression of pro-inflammatory responses in the visceral fat of mice. In addition, in vitro experiments indicated that MRC-Q could directly transform macrophages to the M2 phenotype.

A novel mitochondrial preparation, MRC-Q, protected against adipose tissue remodeling in DIO mice by promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory responses in visceral fat.

• Administration of freeze-thawed isolated mitochondria (MRC-Q) significantly improved adipose tissue remodeling and attenuated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity (DIO) in mice.

• MRC-Q induces macrophages toward M2 polarization.

• MRC-Q promoted endogenous mitochondria biogenesis as evidenced by increased expression of PGC1α and Tfam in the setting of adipose tissue remodeling.

Recent studies have shown that white adipose tissue (responsible for fat storage) and brown fat (responsible for heat production) can transform into each other depending on the status of the mitochondria. The higher mitochondrial density in brown fat compared to white fat is attributed to the unique expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs).11In this process, not only UCP-1 is expressed, but also transcription factors and coactivators, such as PPARγ and PGC1α, are involved.12Therefore, promoting the conversion of white fat into brown fat has emerged as a promising strategy for treating obesity. However, it remains entirely unknown whether exogenous mitochondrial supplementation can suppress adipose tissue remodeling or the progression of obesity-related pathologies. Based on these recent advancements, we hypothesized that exogenous administration of isolated mitochondria could delay the progression of obesity by enhancing adipose tissue remodeling.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether the administration of a freeze-thawed isolated mitochondria preparation could have a protective effect on adipose-tissue remodeling in a well-established murine model of HFD induced-obesity.

All procedures in this study were approved by the Animal Ethics Review Board of the Nagoya University School of Medicine (M240199-001). C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were acquired from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan), and housed in a controlled environment at the Animal Research Institute of Nagoya University, with a 12-h light/dark cycle, constant humidity, and temperature maintained at 23℃. The mice had ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were randomly assigned to normal diet group (SHAM) (n=5), DIO group (n=10) and DIO plus mitochondrial preparation (MRC-Q) intraperitoneal injection (DIO+MRC-Q) (n=5). The mice in the normal diet group were fed a normal diet for 12 weeks, while the mice in the DIO group and DIO+MRC-Q group were fed the HFD (60% calories from fat) for 12 weeks. The DIO+MRC-Q group received intraperitoneal injections of MRC-Q (20 μg per mouse) every 2 weeks. The SHAM and DIO groups were injected with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The handling of animals was in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nagoya University.

Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously.14Visceral fat cryosections were collected from the abdominal cavity of mice at specific time points and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (SAKURA, USA). The sections were 20-μm thick, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), washed twice with PBS, and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies CD68 (1 : 1,000, Biolegend, USA), CD163 mAb (1 : 1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD206 (1 : 1,000, Biolegend) and F4/80 Ab (1 : 1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at 4℃ overnight, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1 : 1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Alexa-Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1 : 1,000, Molecular Probes) for 1 h room temperature.8The cell nuclei were identified with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 : 1,000, DOJINDO). Images were observed at ×20 magnification using a BZ-X710 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE, Japan).

After 12 weeks’ treatment, mice underwent an intraperitoneal GTT. Briefly, mice were fasted overnight and then stimulated with 2 g/kg d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), and blood glucose was subsequently measured continuously for up to 120 min using a blood glucose level monitor (Glutest Ace, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co, Nagoya, Japan).

Western Blot analysis was performed as described previously.14Visceral adipose tissue samples were ground, and the total protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, USA). The membranes were cut according to molecular weight and then incubated with antibodies against total and cleaved Tfam (dilution, 1 : 1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Pgc1α (dilution, 1 : 1,000, proteintech). The membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxide-linked secondary antibodies (dilution, 1 : 2,000, Dako) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing 3 times with PBS plus Tween, protein expression was visualized using the enhanced Chemi-Lumi one system (BIO-RAD). The intensity of the protein bands was normalized to the amount of GAPDH (dilution, 1 : 2,000, Cell signaling) and expressed as the ratio (fold increase) of the control value.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mL of thioglycollate medium in and killed humanely 5 days later. Next, 4 mL of PBS was injected intraperitoneally, and the fluid was aspirated and centrifuged through a 70-μm mesh to obtain peritoneal macrophages. After 24 h of adaptation, the macrophages were divided into 2 groups. The PBS group was supplemented with PBS, and the MRC-Q group was supplemented with MRC-Q (final 150 μg/mL). After 24 h, the cells were collected for subsequent experiments.

Flow cytometry analysis was performed as previously described.15The treated peritoneal macrophages (as mentioned above) were resuspended in pre-prepared Zombie solution and kept away from light for 15 min. Prepared antibody solution was used for staining and kept away from light for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, 100 µL fixative solution was added and the sample placed on ice for 10 min. Next, 1.5 mL PBS was added and centrifuged for 10 min. After the supernatant was discarded, 700 µL of FACS buffer (PBS base 0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA) was added to each sample and set aside. Flow cytometry (LSRFortessa X-20, Becton Dickinson, USA) was used for analysis. The data obtained were analyzed using FlowJo software (Becton Dickinson).

Continuous parametric data are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean (SEM) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to evaluate data distribution. For variables with a normal distribution, statistical significance was evaluated using an unpaired Student’s t-test between 2 groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used for ≥3 groups. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

MRC-Q attenuated the high-fat DIO in terms of body weight from 7 weeks after treatment through to 12 weeks (Figure 1A,B). In addition, the amount of visceral adipose was reduced by MRC-Q treatment (Figure 1C,D). Next, we measured the blood glucose of mice every two weeks at a fixed time (3 p.m.) and found that the casual blood glucose in the MRC-Q treatment group was lower than that of the DIO group (Figure 1E). Furthermore, the GTT experiment found that the glucose tolerance of mice was improved by MRC-Q treatment (Figure 1F). Histological analysis showed that the size of the adipocytes in visceral fat was significantly reduced after MRC-Q treatment (Figure 1G–I).

Figure 2A,Bshows that treatment with MRC-Q significantly reduced the crown-like structure (CLS) in the visceral fat of the DIO mice. In addition, the number of F4/80-positive cells was reduced, and the numbers of CD163- or CD206-positive cells were increased after MRC-Q treatment (Figure 2C–F). These findings were supported by altered expression of macrophage surface markers (Figure 2G,Supplementary Figure 1A,Table), indicating that MRC-Q may have promoted polarization towards M2 macrophages in the visceral fat of mice. As a result, pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) were attenuated against DIO by the MRC-Q treatment (Figure 2H).

Figure 3A,Bshows that the protein expression of PGC1α and Tfam in the visceral fat was recovered by MRC-Q treatment against DIO. These findings were supported by the upregulated expression of mitochondrial DNA (i.e., mt-Nd-1, mt-ND-5), indicating that mitochondria biogenesis was promoted by MRC-Q treatment (Figure 3C). Interestingly, the expression of UCP-1 was also upregulated by MRC-Q treatment in the adipose tissue (Figure 3D).

MRC-Q treatment of isolated peritoneal macrophage reduced M1 surface marker (CD11c, CD86) expression and conversely augmented M2 surface markers (CD163, CD206, and Arg-1) (Figure 4A). FACS analysis also revealed that the proportion of M2 phenotype in isolated macrophages was upregulated by MRC-Q (Figure 4B). Furthermore, pro-M1 phenotype signaling (i.e., STAT1, Activin A, iNOS, and SOCS3) was downregulated by MRC-Q treatment (Figure 4C). On the other hand, pro-M2 phenotype signaling (i.e., KLF4, PPARγ, LXRα, IRF4, and BMP-7) was upregulated (Figure 4D).

Taken together, the findings suggested that MRC-Q treatment could change macrophages toward their anti-inflammatory phenotype.

Obesity and T2DM caused by excessive energy intake have become global health issues.10In this study, we investigated the effects of MRC-Q treatment on DIO mice and explored the potential underlying mechanisms (Figure 5). Our findings indicated that MRC-Q administration significantly improved HFD-induced obesity and reduced blood glucose levels in mice. In addition, the MRC-Q treatment alleviated the formation of the CLS in the visceral fat of DIO mice, suggesting a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration, and promoted polarization to M2 macrophages. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial transfer plays an important role in regulating immune responses. For instance, mesenchymal stem cell-mediated transfer of mitochondria rescued target organs from tissue damage mediating T-cell activation and T regulatory cell differentiation.16In our study, we focused on the relationship of exogenous healthy mitochondria transfer and macrophages in terms of DIO. Obesity is a pro-inflammatory state in which mitochondrial functions are impaired,17,18which creates a self-reinforcing pro-inflammatory state that exacerbates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are hallmarks of obesity-induced glucose intolerance. Our current study demonstrated that MRC-Q administration induced macrophages toward M2-polarization, resulting in decreasing inflammatory cytokine production in the setting of obesity. In other words, MRC-Q could exert anti-inflammatory effects and interrupt the pathological adverse feedback loop associated with metabolic syndrome, thereby mitigating the progression of obesity.

Potential underlying mechanisms of MRC-Q effect against HFD-induced obesity. In the HFD-diet-induced obesity model, MRC-Q administration induced macrophages toward M2-polarity and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in adipose tissue, leading to suppression of adipose-tissue remodeling, obesity, and improvement of glucose intolerance. HFD, high-fat diet.

Impaired mitochondrial dynamics, including reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, are closely linked to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.19,20Mitochondrial biogenesis plays a crucial role in adipogenesis, adipocyte differentiation, and thermogenesis. PGC1α, the primary regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis enhances the expression of Tfam, a key factor in mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription.21Our results demonstrated that MRC-Q promoted mitochondria biogenesis as evidenced by increased protein expression of PGC1α and Tfam, as well as mitochondrial gene expression in adipose tissues, contributing to its protective effect against adipose tissue remodeling and potentially mitigating the detrimental changes associated with obesity.

Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondria can be transferred between cells, and this process plays a critical role in regulating metabolic homeostasis. Adipocytes, and macrophages in particular, are key players in this intercellular mitochondrial transfer. Under normal physiological conditions, this transfer helps to maintain metabolic balance and proper adipose tissue function. However, in the context of obesity, particularly in DIO models, mitochondrial transfer from adipocytes to macrophages is significantly impaired, exacerbating metabolic dysfunction and contributing to the progression of obesity and its related complications.22This reduction in mitochondrial transfer has been linked to increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and lipid accumulation in adipose tissues. We hypothesized that MRC-Q treatment could help to shift macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, further promoting the uptake of healthy mitochondria. This positive feedback loop between mitochondrial transfer and macrophage polarization could be a crucial mechanism underlying the observed protective effects of MRC-Q in our study. Therefore, MRC-Q holds promise as an effective treatment strategy for metabolic diseases associated with HFD-induced obesity by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and adipose tissue inflammation.

MRC-Q has been previously studied in the context of mitochondrial disease, particularly using the Ndufs4 KO mouse model of Leigh syndrome (LS). That study13demonstrated that systemic administration of MRC-Q improves survival and motor function in LS models. In addition, after intravenous administration, MRC-Q-derived human mtDNA was detected in multiple tissues of Ndufs4KO mice, including blood, spleen, liver, bone marrow, heart, lung, and brain, indicating systemic biodistribution.13However, direct mechanistic evidence in peripheral metabolic tissues or in acquired disease models has not been explored. Our current study identified a distinct and novel immunomodulatory mechanism of MRC-Q in an acquired metabolic disease model. These findings broaden the mechanistic understanding of MRC-Q and suggest its potential as a therapeutic across diverse inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

In conclusion, our findings provide important insights into the therapeutic potential of MRC-Q treatment against DIO. MRC-Q could be a novel approach to mitigating obesity-related metabolic disorders, positioning it as a promising candidate for future therapeutic development.
