The electrical loss mechanisms of multi‐tuned birdcages were studied to design an efficient triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) body coil at 7T. The sources of RF power loss were investigated in three aspects, namely, resistive losses in copper conductors, dielectric losses of capacitors, and resonance‐induced losses in tank circuits of multi‐tuned circuits all normalized to the intrinsic losses in tissue of a single‐tuned birdcage. A 24‐leg triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) high‐pass birdcage coil with two out of three short circuits in the end rings (i.e., eight effective legs) connected to tuning capacitors (16caps‐birdcage) was compared with a classical 24‐leg double‐tuned (2H/31P) birdcage coil (48caps‐birdcage). The electric loss in the tissue remains dominant over the coil conductor loss. When loaded with the head in the center and copper and capacitor losses were included, decreasing the number of legs in the birdcage design can increase the B1+field intensity by 6%–41% at the frequency range from31P to2H. The loss factor of capacitors is amplified when incorporating multi‐tuning circuitries. That is, the dominant non‐tissue losses are caused by the multi‐tuned circuits as they contribute to a 67%/60%/49% decrease in the B1+field intensity when considering a 24‐leg design at2H/23Na/31P frequencies, respectively. Therefore, the triple‐tuned wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage experimental design employing 16 triple‐tuned circuits maintained or even improved the coil efficiency by 0 dB/3.45/3.75 dB at2H/23Na/31P frequencies compared with the classical 24‐leg design utilizing 48 double‐tuned circuits. The B1+maps of the triple‐tuned wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage design showed 5.1, 4.1, and 13.5 μT of B1+field intensity at the center of the body phantom at2H,23Na, and31P frequencies, respectively. Reducing the number of effective legs in a triple‐tuned birdcage is an impactful method to maintain relatively high B1+efficiency.

The high loss of the body and multi‐tuned circuits is dominant in birdcage coils. Reducing the number of effective legs to eight in a 24‐leg triple‐tuned body coil maintained or even improved the coil efficiency by 0 dB/3.45/3.75 dB at2H/23Na/31P frequencies compared with the classical 24‐leg design utilizing 48 double‐tuned circuits.

The birdcage coil geometry [1] is most often utilized in the implementation of transmit radiofrequency (RF) coils owing to its distinctive features yielding a homogeneous magnetic field distribution across a substantial portion of the coil volume. Additionally, this geometry results in a non‐zero B1+intensity at the center, leading to exceptional volume excitation capabilities. The primary focus for the birdcage geometry is to ensure homogeneity and to optimize its efficiency by adjusting the coil parameters. For instance, implementing a high‐pass geometry for a single‐tuned small‐volume birdcage can yield high B1+intensity at ultra‐high field (UHF) MRI [2]; employing shorter coil length on a single‐tuned birdcage can improve the axial coil efficiency [1,3]; and increasing the number of legs to eight or more can enhance homogeneity [4]. Nevertheless, such optimization methods can only be effective to some extent considering the dominant loss effect of high‐power capacitors [5,6].

X‐nuclei MRSI, in other words, metabolic imaging, has maintained its importance over the past four decades. While31P MRS provides insights into phosphate metabolites and cellular energetics [7],23Na MRI is employed to evaluate the physiology of the brain, breast, muscles, and cancer metabolism [8]. Alternatively,2H MRS contributes to the understanding of glucose metabolism [9]. On the other hand, a major challenge in metabolic image acquisition lies in the low abundance of these nuclei in the body and the unavailability of state‐of‐the‐art RF coil setups optimized for these nuclei. Therefore, dedicated integrated hardware is required both for transmit and receive purposes for X‐nuclei MRI. Consequently, this fact has sparked growing interest in the field of multi‐tuned RF coils. Especially, double‐tuned birdcage designs have gained prominence since the 1990s. Various methodologies have been proposed for designing such coils, including: (1) incorporating passive elements [10,11,12,13,14,15,16], (2) employing active switches [17,18], (3) utilizing a four‐ring approach [19,20], (4) applying geometrical decoupling [21], and (5) using metamaterial‐based structures [22].

When using the passive elements, most double‐tuned birdcages include one or more tank circuits. These double‐tuned circuits are placed on the typical location of the tuning capacitors in a conventional birdcage design. Consequently, the number of double‐tuned circuits is equal to the number of originally used tuning capacitors. However, Schnall et al. [15] emphasized the significance of tank circuit losses [10,13,23,24,25]. Hence, increasing the number of legs to enhance the homogeneity of a multi‐tuned birdcage design is in conflict with improving its efficiency. Additionally, recent studies have highlighted the significant dominance of tissue noise over coil noise at UHF MRI [23,24]. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive examination at UHF to delve into the loss mechanisms in multi‐tuned birdcages is crucial to pave the way for an efficient B1+field.

Our goal in this study is to understand the relative contribution of loss sources from conductors, capacitors, double‐tuned circuits, and triple‐tuned circuits in optimizing the B1+field strength to design the first triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) integrated efficient birdcage body coil at 7T. First, the loss of capacitors was examined extensively by verifying their specifications in the experimental condition [6]. Then, double‐tuned and triple‐tuned circuits were created in a circuit simulation environment to calculate their effective resistance by including the Q values of each component. Afterwards, a double‐tuned loop coil and a triple‐tuned loop coil were built on the bench using the same components as in the simulations. Q values of the loop coils were measured to indirectly calculate the loss of the double‐tuned and triple‐tuned circuits in the experimental setup. Then, two 24‐leg birdcage coils having the same dimension were created in an electromagnetic (EM) simulation environment such that one design had 2 × 8 short circuits on each end ring (less effective legs), resulting in fewer tuning capacitors (16caps‐birdcage) than the other (48caps‐birdcage). The B1+field strength of the birdcage coils was calculated in the presence of capacitor loss and multi‐tuned loss. The double‐tuned 16caps‐birdcage and the triple‐tuned 16caps‐birdcage coils were built on the bench to verify the simulation results by bench results. The validity of our approach is substantiated through phantom and in vivo studies.

Experiments were conducted considering Larmor frequencies of2H,23Na, and31P at 7T (Philips, Best, the Netherlands), which are 45.75, 78.80, and 120.68 MHz, respectively.

The investigation of the loss mechanisms of the copper conductors of a 40‐cm‐long 24‐leg high‐pass birdcage coil (Ø = 60 cm) concentrated on two aspects: the loss of one leg and the loss of an endring piece positioned between two tuning capacitors. The length of a single leg and each endring piece was 40 and 7 cm (≅60π/24), respectively. Two loop coils with a 40 cm long conductor (L40) and a 7 cm long conductor (L7) were created to indirectly compute the loss in a single leg (Rleg) and a single endring piece (Rendring), respectively. L40 and L7 were tuned using small‐case capacitors characterized by negligible losses (100B, AVX, USA) at2H,23Na, and31P frequencies. The quality factors (Q) of L40 and L7 were measured across all three frequencies, and their corresponding losses were subsequently calculated. Notably, all copper conductors employed in both the birdcage and the loops were standardized at a width of 1 cm.

In the construction of transmit coils, large‐case capacitors (100E, AVX, USA) were selected for their durability under high voltage conditions. As outlined in the specification document of the 100E series [6], the Q‐factors for this capacitor series at 30 MHz served as a basis for calculating losses at the2H and23Na frequencies.

Capacitor losses at the31P frequency were assessed by taking the specification document into account and by conducting bench experiments. Initially, an approximate line representing Q‐factors at 150 MHz was estimated, referring to the Q‐factor trends of the 100C series [25]. Knowing the Q‐factors, the loss can be derived by12πfQC, wherefis the operating frequency, andCis the capacitance. The calculated results were validated at a few sampled capacitance values by on‐bench experiments. Two loop coils, a 13 cm long coil (L13) and a 38 cm long coil (L38), were tuned at the31P frequency using various methods, such as serial and parallel capacitor connections, in order to include more capacitance values in the validation as possible. For instance, L13 was tuned by a single serial 30 pF capacitor and alternatively, by three 10 pF capacitors connected in parallel. Similarly, L38 was tuned using a single serial 10 pF capacitor and three serial 30 pF capacitors. The corresponding Q values were measured for each configuration. In the process of calculating losses, the equivalent circuitry for each case was considered, resulting in the final loss values being derived through division and multiplication based on the number of elements in the serial and parallel connections, respectively. The loss of each capacitor was then calculated accordingly.

A tank circuit and a serial capacitor (Figure1a) were implemented [15] as a double‐tuned circuit configuration. Specifically, two configurations were devised: a2H/31P double‐tuned and a23Na/31P double‐tuned circuit. The loss of the double‐tuned circuit was evaluated by an indirect approach, where the double‐tuned circuit was soldered onto a 25‐cm‐long loop coil. The loop coil's Q‐factors at the corresponding frequencies were measured. Afterwards, measured Q‐factors of the2H/31P double‐tuned and the23Na/31P double‐tuned circuits were used to compute losses for all three frequencies.

(c) The simulated 24‐leg high pass birdcage coil (48caps‐birdcage) where the loss of each leg, the loss of the endring piece, and the loss of the tuning capacitor are represented by Rleg_48, Rendring_48, and Rcap_48. (d) The simulated 24‐leg high pass birdcage coil tuned by short circuiting two out of three end ring capacitors (16caps‐birdcage) where the loss of each leg, the loss of the endring piece, and the loss of the tuning capacitor are represented by Rleg_16, Rendring_16, and Rcap_16.

A triple‐tuned circuit configuration was implemented, employing two serial tank circuits and a serial capacitor [15] (Figure1b). The loss of the triple‐tuned circuit was indirectly assessed by soldering onto a 25‐cm‐long loop coil and measuring the Q‐factors. The Q‐factors of the2H/23Na/31P triple‐tuned circuit were measured for all nuclei, and subsequent calculations were performed to evaluate the losses.

Two double‐tuned circuits (2H/31P,23Na/31P) and a triple‐tuned circuit (2H/23Na/31P) were created in a circuit simulation environment (AWR, Cadence Design Systems). The components for the double‐tuned2H/31P circuit were CD1= 56 pF, CD2= 33 pF, LD1= 68 nH; for the double‐tuned23Na/31P circuit, they were CD1= 20 pF, CD2= 68 pF, LD1= 23 nH; and for the triple‐tuned2H/23Na/31P circuit, they were CT1= 68 pF, CT2= 47 pF, CT3= 24 pF, LT1= 39 nH, LT2= 100 nH. The loss of the components was included in the simulation by considering their Q values. The real part of the impedance of the circuits was used to calculate the circuit loss.

A 40‐cm‐long 24‐leg high‐pass birdcage coil (Ø = 59 cm) alongside a shield (Ø = 63.5 cm) was created in a 3D EM simulation software (Sim4life, Zurich MedTech AG, Switzerland). Both the birdcage coil and the shield were modeled as perfect electric conductors (PECs). Maintaining consistent coil parameters, including the number of legs, the length, and the diameter, a comparative study was facilitated between two distinct birdcage designs: the 48caps‐birdcage and the 16caps‐birdcage.

The 48caps‐birdcage design was tuned classically as a high‐pass birdcage; that is, employing a total of 48 tuning capacitors (Figure2a), 24 for each endring. Alternatively, the 16caps‐birdcage design followed a novel approach by short‐circuiting two out of every three capacitor gaps on the endrings (Figure2b). This design modification resulted in the utilization of eight tuning capacitors per endring, totaling 16 tuning capacitors.

The pink and the gray parts indicate the conductor piece used in calculating the loss of a 7‐cm‐long endring piece (Rendring) and a 40‐cm‐long leg (Rleg). (b) The 16caps‐birdcage design which is tuned by 8 + 8 capacitors by shorting every two out of three legs. (c) The wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage design where every three legs are placed closely and the angle between every leg group is 45°.

B1+field intensity was subsequently computed under two distinct loss cases, namely, (1) Rleg, Rendring, and Rcapincluded and (2) Rleg, Rendring, and RMT. Rleg, Rendring, and Rcapwere determined by the aforementioned calculations and bench measurements. In the Rleg, Rendring, and RMTcase, Rlegwas connected in serial to each leg; Rendringand RMTwere connected in serial to the endrings. RMTis the loss of the multi‐tuning circuit.

Furthermore, diverse loading cases were explored, namely, the human model's [26] head, the human model's abdomen, and a body phantom (26.13 L,σ= 0.55 S/m,ε= 74). These investigations sought to elucidate the impact of loading types on the B1+field efficiency. The abdomen and phantom cases are considered as the load loss‐dominated cases, whereas the head case is referred to as the coil loss‐dominated case. In addition, local SAR for each coil was computed.

We designed two different high‐pass birdcages: the 48caps‐birdcage (Figure2a) and the 16caps‐birdcage. The 16caps‐birdcage was designed in two versions: either by short‐circuiting two out of three endring segments (Figures2bandS1b), or by moving the short‐circuited legs close to each other to effectively act like an 8‐leg (wide‐leg) birdcage (Figures2candS1c,d). The parameters of the birdcages, including length (40 cm), diameter (60 cm), and conductor width (1 cm), were maintained the same across all designs. The right mode of each birdcage was determined by two pick‐up probes and by observing a stable peak on the S21graph when moving the probe from one side to the other side in the birdcage. The coupling between a matched birdcage port and a pick‐up probe refers to coil efficiency. This parameter is monitored via S21. To plot S21, the birdcage port is connected to channel‐1 of a VNA (Vector Network Analyzer, Copper Mountain Technologies, USA) and a pick‐up probe connected to channel‐2 of the VNA. The same pick‐up probe was used in all coil efficiency measurements and rotated slightly around the center of the FOV to search for the maximum S21. A body phantom (26.13 L,σ= 0.55 S/m,ε= 74 at 120 MHz) with a hole in the center that fits the pick‐up probe was employed to load the birdcage coils during the matching process and the efficiency measurements on the bench. S11_2H, S11_23Na, and S11_31Prefer to the reflection coefficient of Port 1 of the birdcage coil for2H,23Na, and31P frequencies, respectively. S22_2H, S22_23Na, and S22_31Prefer to the reflection coefficient of Port 2 of the birdcage coil for2H,23Na, and31P frequencies, respectively.

A 24‐leg double‐tuned2H/31P 48caps‐birdcage (FigureS1a) is our default operating transmit bore coil in our 7T system (Achieva with DDAS upgrade, Philips, Best, the Netherlands). This birdcage coil is referred to as the reference double‐tuned body coil throughout the text. Forty‐eight double‐tuned circuits (Figure1a, CD1= 100 pF, LD1= 30 nH, CD2= 159 pF) in total were employed in the reference double‐tuned body coil. The efficiency of the reference double‐tuned body coil was measured with the body phantom.

Several versions of the 16caps‐birdcage were designed, simulated, and constructed to assess multiple single‐tuned (2H,23Na, and31P), multiple double‐tuned (2H/31P,23Na/31P) and a triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) setup all with effectively 8 × 3 parallel rods and 16 tuning circuits (see FigureS2for full overview) [27]. The components for the single‐tuned2H,23Na, and31P were 100, 30, and 11 pF, respectively. For the double‐tuned2H/31P and23Na/31P circuit components (Figure1a) were CD1= 56 pF, LD1= 68 nH, CD2= 33 pF, and CD1= 68 pF, LD1= 23 nH, CD2= 20 pF, respectively. For the triple‐tuned2H/23Na/31P circuit components (Figure1b) were CT1= 68 pF, CT2= 47 pF, CT3= 24 pF, LT1= 39 nH, and LT2= 100 nH. Afterwards, the efficiency of the single‐tuned, double‐tuned, and triple‐tuned versions was measured when loaded and matched. Additionally, another triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage coil equipped with a segmented (to minimize gradient field induced eddy‐currents) RF shield (FigureS1c) was constructed on a mechanical former that could be shifted inside the bore of the 7T MRI for basic phantom and in vivo experiments. The triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage was matched via triple‐matching (FigureS3).

The triple‐tuned (2H/23Na/31P) wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage coil (FigureS1c) with the segmented shield was used as the transmit volume coil. The peak RF power in total was 5, 5, and 24 kW (12 kW per port) for2H,23Na, and31P frequencies, respectively. The average power remained well below the SAR levels of 8 W/kg peak and 3 W/kg global based on the SAR simulations. The body coil was driven in quadrature mode at all frequencies.

Two different receive coils were employed. An eight‐channel2H/31P receive array with eight transmit‐receive fractioned transmit/receive1H dipole antennas [28] (WaveTronica B.V., Utrecht, the Netherlands) was used in2H/31P phantom imaging and2H in vivo abdomen imaging. A quintuple‐tuned receive whole brain coil (1H/19F/31P/23Na/13C, TeslaDC, Zaltbommel, the Netherlands) [23] was employed in23Na phantom imaging and23Na/31P in vivo imaging. Each acquisition set of metabolic imaging started with1H acquisitions to determine the FOV. Then, nominal flip angle series were applied to calculate the corresponding B1+field strength during phantom studies. Series included 10°–200° with a step of 10° at2H,23Na, and31P frequencies.

Scan parameters of phantom studies, in vivo studies, and B1+maps are detailed in Table1. In vivo2H FID was obtained from the liver of a healthy male volunteer (49 years old), whereas in vivo23Na FID and31P MRSI were obtained from the brain of a healthy female volunteer (34 years old) with informed consent. B1+maps at2H and31P frequencies were acquired using a multi‐nuclei body phantom (3 g/L NaCl, 150 g H2KO4P, 137 mL D2O, 26 L H2O) and the eight‐channel2H/31P receive array.23Na B1+map was acquired using a sphere phantom (6.5 g/L H2KO4P, 3.4 g/L NaCl, 645 mL H2O) and the quintuple‐tuned receive whole brain coil.

Rendringcalculated by L7 at2H,23Na, and31P frequencies are 0.02, 0.025, and 0.03 Ω, respectively. Thus, Rendringat the23Na and31P frequencies was 1.25‐fold and 1.50‐fold of Rendringmeasured at the2H frequency. Rlegcalculated through L40 at2H,23Na, and31P frequencies are 0.125, 0.3, and 0.5 Ω, respectively. Hence, Rlegat the23Na and31P frequencies was 2.4‐fold and 4.0‐fold of Rlegmeasured at the2H frequency.

The loss graph from the specification document of the capacitors (Figure3) at 30 MHz indicates that the loss is maximum at 1 pF, followed by a steep decrease until 10 pF, with relatively identical losses observed between 10 and 100 pF. The loss graph at 150 MHz, derived from the approximate line (Figure3), demonstrated a consistent trend: capacitances between 1 and 10 pF were more lossy, and losses for those between 10 and 100 pF remained relatively identical. According to the loss graph at 150 MHz, R10pFand R30pFwere determined as 0.1 and 0.3 Ω, respectively. The on‐bench experiments conducted at the31P frequency are detailed in Table2. Specifically, R10pFin L13 and L38 were 0.24 Ω (0.08 Ω*3) and 0.29 Ω, respectively. Additionally, R30pFin L13 and L38 were 0.10 and 0.14 Ω (0.42 Ω / 3), respectively. So, the bench measurements are similar to the extrapolated losses from the vendor specification document.

The loss results of the double‐tuning setups and the triple‐tuning setup are given in Table3. It is evident that the loss at the2H frequency is comparatively lower than that at higher frequencies such as23Na and31P. Moreover, as the difference between two target frequencies in a double‐tuned circuit decreases, there is a substantial increase in the resulting loss in the circuitry [15] such that the loss at31P frequency on the double‐tuned23Na/31P circuit is 35% higher than that on the double‐tuned2H/31P circuit. Note that the extra loss when moving from double‐tuned to triple‐tuned is negligible for31P and23Na while adding 0.19 Ω for2H.

The simulated B1+field intensity at the center of the 48caps‐birdcage and the 16caps‐birdcage under different loss cases and loading types is given in Figure4. Local SAR calculations of the 16caps‐birdcage when loaded with the human model's abdomen are given in Figure5for all frequencies.

The B1+field strength at the center is written at the bottom of each map. Results belonging to2H,23Na, and31P frequencies are shown in green, red, and purple, respectively.

The coil loss‐dominated case (head) of both the 48caps‐birdcage and the 16caps‐birdcage yielded the highest B1+field intensity for all nuclei compared with the load loss‐dominated cases (body and phantom). However, the B1+field intensity in the load loss‐dominated case decreased 5.1%–10.1% in2H 48caps‐birdcage, 0.8%–5.0% in2H 16caps‐birdcage, 13.8%–21.3% in23Na 48caps‐birdcage, 25.3%–47.7% in23Na 16caps‐birdcage, 39.9%–42.2% in31P 48caps‐birdcage, and 43.6%–44.5% in31P 16caps‐birdcage compared with the coil loss‐dominated case. The decreases in the percentage are calculated considering B1+values in the coil loss‐dominated case. Consequently, the 16caps‐birdcage provided the highest B1+field in this case.

The B1+efficiency when comparing the 16caps‐birdcage to the 48caps‐birdcage increased by 36%/39%/38% for2H/23Na/31P when loaded with the head, 40%/21%/32% for the body, and 36%/33%/39% for the phantom, all assuming a 1 Ω loss for the multi‐tuned circuitry. When corrected for the actual measured resistive loss in the circuitries, this will be a gain of 23%/24%/32% for2H/23Na/31P.

The efficiency results of the reference double‐tuned body coil and the double‐tuned2H/31P wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage coil are given in Figure6. The wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage provided 4.3 and 5.3 dB gain at2H and31P frequencies, respectively, compared with the reference double‐tuned body coil.

The double‐tuned and the triple‐tuned bench experiments. Measurements belonging to2H,23Na, and31P are shown in green, red, and purple, respectively. Yellow dots indicate the legs of the birdcage design. Blue squares show the tuning elements in the designs, which are double‐tuned circuits in double‐tuned setups, and triple‐tuned circuits in the triple‐tuned setups. The coil efficiency (S21) is given for each experiment. The wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage was double‐tuned at2H/31P frequencies and triple‐tuned at2H/23Na/31P frequencies. The reference double‐tuned body coil is the2H/31P 48caps‐birdcage.

The wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcag design improved the efficiency at the23Na and the31P frequencies by 3.45 and 3.75 dB increase, respectively (Figure6). On the other hand, the2H efficiency decreased by 4–5 dB back to its original efficiency, which is similar (−0.7 dB until +0.3 dB) to the one in the reference double‐tuned body coil. We concluded that the wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage provided the optimum efficiency results for all nuclei.

The triple‐tuned wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage was inserted in the MRI system for the phantom and in vivo experiments. S11_2H, S11_23Na, and S11_31Pwere −14.3, −10.4, and −11.6 dB, respectively, whereas S22_2H, S22_23Na, and S22_31Pwere −12.0, −8.5, and −11.5 dB, respectively, when the coil was loaded with the body phantom.

The corresponding FID signal was obtained from the area where the receive coils were placed. MRSI from2H,23Na, and31P is shown in phantoms as well as the spectra in vivo of the healthy volunteers (Figure7).

Phantom and in vivo images of all nuclei are given on the left‐hand side and the right‐hand side, respectively. The nominal flip angle series applied for each nucleus during phantom imaging are shown in the middle. In vivo2H FID from the liver,23Na FID from the brain, and31P MRSI from the brain are demonstrated. Results belonging to2H,23Na, and31P are shown with green, red, and purple, respectively.

At the forward peak power of 5, 5, and 24 kW from the RF amplifier, the calculated B1+field strength of2H,23Na, and31P frequency was 5.1, 4.1, and 13.5 μT, respectively, based on the nominal flip angle series (Figure7). B1+maps at2H,23Na, and31P frequencies are demonstrated in Figure8.2H and23Na B1+maps are homogeneous, whereas31P B1+field strength varies up to 20 μT throughout the FOV.

This study thoroughly investigated the loss mechanisms of high‐pass multi‐tuned birdcage coils in terms of copper conductor loss, capacitor loss, and tank circuit loss. Figure4supports the fact that the tissue loss between 45 and 120 MHz surpasses the coil loss [23,24]. Apart from the body loss, the capacitor loss on the endrings had a major effect on the efficiency (Figure4). In most double‐tuned coils, the extra losses are mainly caused by the additional inductor in the tank circuit. However, we noticed significant capacitor losses even in single‐tuned birdcage coils, which only have tuning capacitors and no trap circuits. We found that the losses in Case‐E capacitors vary with their capacitance value. Specifically, capacitors with values between 1 and 10 pF have the highest losses, while those between 10 and 100 pF are more efficient (Figure3). To achieve the desired double‐tuning or triple‐tuning at specific frequencies, certain capacitor values are required. Therefore, designing the most efficient triple‐tuned setup will become a function of the used capacitors. The examination of capacitor loss highlighted the importance of not overlooking the loss in high‐voltage capacitors, given their substantial loss contribution and dominant influence on coil efficiency. This is in agreement with the work of Kuehne et al. [5] that explored the loss mechanisms at 297 MHz. Overall loss examination has shown that one should include losses in EM simulations specific to the designed birdcage coil to obtain more realistic efficiency results.

Including the losses becomes even more apparent for multi‐tuned circuitries as the effective resistive loss of tank circuits will increase due to partial resonance of electrical currents in these tanks. Our research showed that the loss at the31P frequency in the triple‐tuned circuit is lower than that in the23Na/31P double‐tuned circuit. The tank circuit in the double or triple‐tuned designs would give the highest loss due to the relatively higher current density in these tanks compared with single‐tuned designs. Distributing this loss over two tanks (triple‐tuned) rather than one (double‐tuned) would give a lower current density and voltage accumulation in each tank circuit. As the power loss goes quadratic with voltage or current and the distribution over multiple circuits most likely goes more linear than quadratic, the overall power balance may become more favorable.

The key to enhancing multi‐tuned birdcage efficiencies lies in minimizing the total loss on the endrings. Hence, increasing the number of legs to achieve a homogenous magnetic field and thus increase the number of capacitors and multi‐tuned circuitries could hamper the efficiency of multi‐tuned birdcages. Consequently, the conventional approach of using the same number of multi‐tuned circuits as the number of legs should be avoided. We therefore reduced the number of circuits on the endrings from 48 to 16. Indeed, the presence of additional legs on the wide‐leg 16caps‐birdcage did contribute to efficiency improvement as inspired by the multiple parallel legs approach of Xu et al. [27]. Their approach aimed at reducing the loss of the single‐tuned birdcage designs by splitting the current flowing through the legs and therefore decreasing the loss on the legs, while our approach aimed to minimize the loss in the multi‐tuned circuits.

Our study is subject to certain limitations. Firstly, there is a tradeoff between 48caps‐birdcage and 16caps‐birdcage in terms of B1+inhomogeneity and B1+efficiency. While no significant inhomogeneity is observed regarding the loading type in2H 48caps‐birdcage (Figure4), mild inhomogeneities in the B1+field begin to occur at23Na 48caps‐birdcage and31P 48caps‐birdcage in abdomen and phantom loading. Recalling the wavelength in tissue (λr=c0εr·f), whereλris the wavelength in medium,c0is speed of light in free space,εris the permittivity of the medium, andfis the frequency, the wavelength forεr=74at the2H,23Na, and the31P frequency is 76, 44, and 29 cm, respectively. Hence, inhomogeneities result from the relatively short wavelength of23Na and31P frequencies in typical media. Indeed,31P B1+maps from the body phantom that has a relatively high dielectric permittivity (Figure8) validates its simulated B1+field in terms of inhomogeneity.

Alternative strategies have been proposed to use smaller‐sized X‐nuclei body coils that can be positioned on the MRI bed and guided with the subject inside the MRI [29]. Our setup facilitates a relatively uniform B1+field to excite2H,23Na, and31P spins throughout the human body without compromising space for the subject to be scanned. While care must be given to improve matching and reduce gradient eddy currents, our concept may be an attractive setup for facilitating metabolic MRI throughout the body. Designing a triple‐tuned2H/23Na/31P receive body array that would accompany the triple‐tuned2H/23Na/31P body coil could enable whole‐body metabolic MRI acquisition in a single session.

Figure S2:The double‐tuned and the triple‐tuned bench experiments. Measurements belonging to2H,23Na, and31P are shown with green, red, and purple, respectively. Yellow dots indicate the legs of the birdcage design. Blue squares show the tuning elements in the designs, which are double‐tuned circuits in double‐tuned setups and triple‐tuned circuits in the triple‐tuned setups. The coil efficiency (S21) and the reflection coefficient value (S11) are given for each experiment. The 16caps‐birdcage (16caps), the classical 8‐leg, and the wide 8‐leg birdcages were double‐tuned at2H/31P frequencies, whereas the 16caps‐birdcage was double‐tuned at23Na/31P frequencies. The reference double‐tuned body coil is the2H/31P 48caps‐birdcage.
