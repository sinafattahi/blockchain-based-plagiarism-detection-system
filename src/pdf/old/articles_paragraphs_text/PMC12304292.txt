With extreme weather events expected to increase due to climate change, it is essential to understand bushfire preparedness among young adults in Australia, who often risk their safety by driving through bushfire‐risk areas when travelling in summer. The current study investigates the knowledge of bushfire risk management and preparedness among university students in Australia.

One hundred and forty‐eight university students participated in an online survey with closed questions. The data was analysed in SPSS by conducting a descriptive analysis andχ2test between those who have and those who do not have experience with bushfire evacuations.

Over half of respondents who currently live or have lived in a bushfire risk area do not have a written bushfire response plan. Although most respondents reported that they had previously learned about the risk of bushfires in Australia, less than 20% knew the Australian emergency contact number, triple 0 for bushfires. A majority of those who experienced an evacuation fully understood the fire severity scale sign, but only half of those who had not experienced an evacuation fully understood the sign.

Relevant authorities and Australian universities could consider these findings and provide university students with appropriate information to prepare them for future bushfires.

Due to its geography, environment and varying climate, Australia experiences some of the most extreme fire conditions in the world ([1, p. 56, 367]; [2]). According to Vardoulakis et al. [3], there is scientific consensus that climate change has exacerbated prolonged dry, hot conditions, increasing the risk of extreme fires in Australian bushlands. This is exemplified by the Black Summer fires of 2019–2020, which were the largest bushfires in Australian history [4].1The Black Summer bushfires significantly impacted the health of Australian communities, the economy and ecosystems [3,5,6]. A total of over 24 million hectares were burned across the country: a burned area eight times larger than the average of the past two decades [5,7,8,9]. Thirty‐four fatalities were recorded with an additional 417 deaths from long‐term consequences of the bushfires [7]. An epidemiological study of burn‐related fatalities found that 259 burn‐related deaths were recorded in the years of 2009–2015, with the most (n= 105) recorded in NSW [10]. Considering the number of injuries and fatalities from previous bushfire events in Australia, effective safety communications are considered to be “vital to successful disaster preparedness and response” ([11], 16). Therefore, risk communications2for bushfires have become an important area for academic studies [11,13,14,15,16,17].

The risk of fatality and injury due to bushfires varies based on demographic and physical characteristics. The most vulnerable groups are people living with disabilities, those with physical or mental health‐related conditions, and older members of society, who are especially vulnerable [18,19,20,21]. Regarding age groups, the highest proportion (58%) of burn‐related fatalities occurs among people aged 41–80 years in Australia and New Zealand [10]. Similarly, data from the Victorian Black Saturday fires on the 7th of February 2009 showed that people aged 70+ years were much more likely to die compared to younger generations [22], although some studies argue that anyone over 50 years old would be at high risk, due to decreased mobility among other factors [22]. Risk communication is highly important for these vulnerable groups [19,20,23,24], especially given that current bushfire risk communication strategies are found to be poor [19,20,23,24].

Howard et al. argue that culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) residents are another vulnerable group [20]. This group is at high risk for bushfire‐related injuries due to a lack of language proficiency and cultural knowledge about bushfires [20]. Furthermore, older generations, who have been found to be at high risk themselves, are also often responsible for providing relevant risk information to younger generations in CALD communities [20]. This suggests that CALD communities are at greater risk, relying on a vulnerable group, that is, the older generation, to provide relevant information and guidance.

Although some studies argue that older generations are a particularly vulnerable group, MacDonald [25] claims that young generations can be at high risk as well due to their lack of bushfire knowledge and experience. MacDonald [25] explored preparedness for potential bushfire emergencies and previous experience of bushfire events among young adults (aged 18–25 years). The study shows that, despite young generations' desire to participate in disaster preparedness and recovery efforts, they have limited opportunities to receive support and are often excluded from disaster planning within safety organisations, local governments and community‐led initiatives and programs [9]. In the context of Australia, for example, although primary and secondary schools often host safety workshops for bushfires,3such opportunities seem to disappear in higher education [25]. This is a serious concern, given that young adults in Australia often start living independently or apart from their parents after graduating from high school, and therefore may not have access to bushfire safety information typically provided by their former caregivers [30]. International students in tertiary education also often come to Australia by themselves, and they are less likely to have access to community networks at the beginning of their stay [31,32,33,34]. Additionally, many young adults in Australia, including international students, have a driver's licence as well as independent access to a vehicle [35]. Some studies show that young adults opt to travel through bushfire‐prone areas during peak bushfire season, without adequate bushfire preparedness knowledge or strategies [5,7,8,9,36]. International students seem to have even less knowledge of safety information in Australia than domestic students; for example, they have overwhelmingly low levels of beach safety knowledge compared to domestic students [37,38,39]. Given these circumstances, it can be assumed that young adults, including those from other countries, are most likely to rely on public information in emergency situations as it is a primary source of social support when at a distance from their own family [40].

This study, therefore, explores young adults' current knowledge of bushfires and the channels they typically use to seek help and gather information in a bushfire emergency. To do so, this study focuses on a particular cohort: university students in Australia, including international students, the majority of whom are young adults [41].

This study utilised a sample of students currently studying at Australian Universities. Students were recruited through online course announcements and emails distributed by course coordinators, and the investigator, C.A, also used social media (i.e., Facebook and Instagram) to recruit participants. The participant information and consent forms were included in the first page of the survey, and, upon agreement, participants could proceed to the survey. Participants could take the survey at any time between 11th September 2023 and 20th October 2023. One hundred and forty‐eight students from five states and two territories completed the survey, although the majority (81.7%,n= 121) were recruited from South Australia. Of these participants, 134 were domestic students and 14 were international students. The ethics approval for this study was given by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Adelaide (H‐2023‐231).

An online survey was developed with the survey softwareQualtrics. The survey consisted of 16 closed and three open questions. For questions with an ‘other’ option, a textual response was allowed for further clarification. (See TableA1in AppendixAto access the full list of questions.) The survey questions can be categorised into four themes: demographic information, bushfire experience in Australia, bushfire safety knowledge, and channels hypothetically used to gather information in a bushfire emergency. The construct validity of the survey, which is the relevance to the research aim, was first ensured by an extensive literature review [42,43] on disaster communications [11,19,20], bushfire preparation [44], climate change and bushfires [13]. Then, two experts in disaster safety, a former officer of bushfire communication in the Country Fire Service (CFS) South Australia, and a researcher in safety communications, reviewed the survey questions, and revisions were made based on their feedback. To ensure the face validity; the clarity of the survey questions, two postgraduate and three undergraduate students, who could have been potential participants in the study, were invited to participate in a pilot survey and provide feedback [43,45]. The final version of the survey was reviewed by a researcher in the field of sociology before its dissemination (Table1).

Of 176 responses recorded, 28 unfinished surveys were removed from the analysis, leaving 148 responses which were analysed. This study used Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 28.0.1.0 to conduct descriptive analysis. Additionally, aχ2Test of Independence was conducted to compare knowledge of bushfires among those participants who have experienced a bushfire evacuation and those who have not. This test demonstrates that a statistical difference between the two groups is significant when thep‐value is < 0.05 [46]. While bushfire experience can harm mental wellbeing [47,48,49], it can develop psychological preparedness for future events which also influences physical preparedness [50,51]. Therefore, this study looks into any differences regarding bushfire knowledge between these groups.

As Table1shows, 65.6% (n= 97) of respondents are female; 31.0% (n= 46) are male; 1.4% (n= 2) are non‐binary; 2% (n= 3) preferred not to mention. Regarding participants' length of residence in Australia, a majority of respondents (85.8%,n= 127) had lived in Australia for over 10 years. In terms of age, a majority of the participants (94.6%,n= 140) were aged between 18 and 24 years, followed by 25–34 years (3.4%,n= 5).

The majority of participants (90.5%,n= 134) were born in Australia, followed by China (8.1%,n= 12). Most of them (85.8%,n= 127) have lived in Australia for the longest period of their lives, while a few (14.2%,n= 21) indicated that their country of longest residence was outside Australia. The majority of participants (81.7%,n= 121) live in South Australia, followed by Victoria (10.1%,n= 15). There was a small number of participants from across other states and a territory as shown in Table1. As for English language proficiency, 85.5% (n= 127) were native speakers and 6.1% (n= 9) assessed their level of English as proficient. 7.4% (n= 11) considered themselves as competent English speakers. It is notable that most Australian universities require international students to demonstrate an overall minimum IELTS band score of 6.0 (which is considered competent for English users in IELTS)4. In relation to the countries of birth of international students, the majority were from Australia (86.5%,n= 127), followed by China (8.1%,n= 12).

In terms of students' experience in bushfire‐risk areas, Table2shows that 37.8% (n= 56) of the students reported that they are currently living or have lived in a bushfire‐risk area in Australia, while 45.9% (n= 68) do/have not and 16.2% (n= 24) were unsure. Of those respondents who answered, ‘yes’ to living/having lived in a bushfire‐risk area, 32.1% (n= 18) have or had a written bushfire response plan in place, but 57.1% of them (n= 32) have never had a plan and 10.7% (n= 6) were ‘unsure’. In relation to students' habits of bushwalking or hiking, 62.8% (n= 93) participate in these activities at least once or twice every 6 months, with 22.3% (n= 35) participating on a more frequent, monthly basis. Participants were also asked whether they had previously encountered a bushfire or ever experienced an evacuation due to a bushfire situation. To this, 33% (n= 49) responded ‘yes’, while 64.2% (n= 95) responded ‘no’ and 2.7% (n= 4) were unsure.

Bushfireis the typical terminology used in Australia (see [60]), but not necessarily the term commonly used in other parts of the world [61,62,63,64,65]. When prompted with bushfire images from Australia's Black Summer Bushfires (Table3) and asked to describe the natural disaster shown in the images, the most common response among all students was ‘bushfire’ selected by 133 students (90.0%). The second most common response, ‘wildfire’ was elected by 26.4% (n= 39) of participants, followed by ‘forest fire’ (18.2%,n= 27), ‘grass fire’ (16.2%,n= 24) with one participant remaining ‘unsure’ (Table4). Three who selected ‘other’ reported that they described the fire in the image as ‘blaze’, ‘fire’ and ‘fire until asked to specify’.

Participants' knowledge of bushfires and bushfire preparedness.

Note:Aχ2test was not conducted for questions with multiple responses allowed. This data is calculated based on 129 respondents who have experience of learning about bushfires.

As for bushfire education, 87.2% (n= 129) of respondents have previously learned about the risk of bushfires in Australia, whereas 4.7% (n= 7) have not, and 8.1% (n= 12) were unsure. Of those who have previously learnt about bushfire risk (n= 129), 76.7% (n= 99) learned at school, 72.9% (n= 94) learned from media sources, and 52.7% (n= 68) learned from family. 41.9% (n= 54) learned the information from emergency services or officers, and a similar proportion (40.3%,n= 52) learned by themselves from sources such as posters, signage, and online resources. Only 23 (17.8%) indicated that they learned bushfire information from their university. Regarding respondents' knowledge of the Australian emergency service number for bushfires (triple 0), only a few (15.5%,n= 23) could recall the number, but majority were those who could not remember (75.7%,n= 112) or were unsure (8.8%,n= 13).

As for the scale for severity of fire risk in Table3, 60.1% (n= 89) of participants responded that they absolutely understood the meaning of the scale, but 27.7% (n= 41) responded ‘I think I know’ and 11.5% (n= 17) were ‘unsure’ or couldn't say. Regarding this question, there is a statistical difference (p< 0.05) between those who experienced a bushfire‐related evacuation and those who haven't or are unsure if they have. The majority (81.6%,n= 40) of those who experienced an evacuation were fully aware of what the fire severity scale refers to, whereas slightly less than half (49.5%,n= 49) of those who haven't experienced an evacuation or are unsure if they have, fully understood the meaning of the scale. The differences and similarities between these groups are visually presented in Figure1.

In terms of resources that students would hypothetically engage with in a bushfire emergency, the majority (81.1%,n= 120) would use authority websites published by fire services, governments, or councils (Table5). Social media (54.1%,n= 80) was slightly more popular than traditional media such as TV (48.6%,n= 72) and radio (48.6%,n= 72). 40.5% (n= 60) reported they would rely on family or friends, and a few (23.0%,n= 34) would ask neighbours or strangers. Among those who selected social media (n= 80), Facebook was the most popular application (36.3%,n= 29), followed by Instagram (27.5%,n= 22), X (formerly known as Twitter) (11.3%,n= 9), and YouTube (7.5%,n= 6). Only a very few would use an emergency service app (6.3%,n= 5).

Channels hypothetically used to collect information in a bushfire.

Note:This is calculated based on 80 responses who indicated that they would use social media to gather information during a bushfire.

This study shows that almost 90% of university students had experience learning about bushfires. Of those, three in four received bushfire education at school, but over 80% of them did not receive any bushfire education at university. Despite having previously learnt about bushfires, approximately 85% of respondents did not know or were unsure of the bushfire emergency service phone number, triple 0 [69,70]. Although it is not clear whether the participants were taught the emergency service number in their previous bushfire education, it is important to consider this finding and inform university students about the emergency number, with a reminder that the emergency call service can only be accessed in areas with mobile coverage [70]. This study also found that half of those who have not experienced a bushfire‐related evacuation or were unsure if they have, did not fully understand the fire severity scale, as opposed to 80% of experienced students who knew its meaning. Regardless of whether they have experienced an evacuation, understanding the fire severity scale is essential for university students, who often travel through bushfire risk areas in summer [5,7,8,9,36]. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that over 45% of respondents engage in hiking or bushwalking at least once every 3 months. This implies that those students who visit bushlands for leisure, exercise or travel, could potentially face dangerous situations if they are unaware of the level of fire severity indicated by these signs. Considering that one in three students have experienced a bushfire evacuation, it is important for those engaging in these activities to check the fire severity level and determine a safety plan before travelling through bushlands.

Given that many of the respondents do not know or remember the emergency number, information retention also needs to be considered when delivering bushfire education. Phone numbers, which typically require conscious effort to memorise, need encoding via repetition, rehearsal, and reinforcement so that they are not easily forgotten [71,72] and become “highly resistant to disruption” [73]. In order to achieve this outcome, Disaster Resilience Education (DRE) needs to be provided not only to primary or secondary school students but also across tertiary institutions in Australia. DRE is essential at a university level to increase students' understanding of disaster hazards, thus preparing them for any bushfire‐related emergencies [74].

Of all interpretations of the images in Table3,bushfirewas the most common term to describe a fire disaster among the participants. However, this study also shows that some students use other terms such aswildfire(26.4%),forest fire(18.2%), andgrass fire(16.2%). In fact, globally, terms to describe a fire are not consistent. For example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) useswildfireon their website [75], which seems to be common for the North America region [17,44,75,76,77].Forest fireis used even in some areas of Australia [5,78] and equivalent terms seem common in Indonesia [79], China [62,63], and Brazil [61].

Given thatbushfire(or its literal translation) is not a common term in some countries, it is questionable whether newly arrived migrants (e.g., international students) would understand the significance of a fire expressed by this term. According to the Oxford English Dictionary [80], the termbushis defined as a shrub, “particularly one with close branches arising from or near the ground; a small clump of shrubs” forming one plant. This implies thatbushfirecould be construed as a “fire” on a smaller scale, which burns only individual small shrubs. This issue of wording becomes more apparent when attempting to translate the termbushfireinto Chinese on Google Translate [81].Bush fireis translated ascónglín‘jungle’ +dàhuǒ‘fire’. It seems thatbushfirecannot be translated literally in Chinese, so the semantic significance of the fire is expressed by a different word,cónglín‘jungle’. This could create confusion especially for those who don't speak English as their first language and may affect their ability to respond to emergency situations accordingly. Therefore, future studies need to explore how the wordbushfireis understood by those who are born overseas and/or speak English as a second language.

This study also explored possible channels that university students would use to gather information in a bushfire situation. Over 80% of participants tend to use authority websites including those published by the council, local government, and fire services. 54% of students also use social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and X, which were slightly more popular than traditional media such as television (48.6%) and radio (48.6%). Previous studies show that television and radio are the most popular channels [20,24] but this tendency may be changing among younger generations who frequently use social media [82]. Therefore, authorities need to advise younger generations that social media sources are not a universal choice and have some limitations [24]. For example, during bushfire season, electricity supply could be interrupted due to faults, fires, or turned off by the power network to prevent a bushfire [83]. This is especially the case for those living in bushfire risk areas and is also applicable for those who frequent bushfire risk areas for travelling or outdoor activities.5In such situations, internet connection would be compromised, meaning gathering bushfire information via social media as well as authority websites would not be reliable. Therefore, students in these circumstances would require sufficient bushfire preparedness knowledge including (but not limited to) emergency contact numbers, escape routes, and an understanding of first aid.

Accessibility of information is a key benefit of emergency service applications. Emergency service apps—also known as disaster apps—have been developed to curate, disseminate, and transfer emergency information during disasters both in Australia and globally [84]. Recent studies have explored their potential functions to provide critical assistance to civilians and relay information to emergency services in times of crisis ([84,85,86,87]). As investigated in these studies, the majority of these apps use GPS location services to access the location of the user in relation to hazards, and/or to provide emergency services with this information should the user need assistance. Although improvement of the bushfire map on the app may still be required [88], emergency service apps are practical in the bush or remote environments and are likely to be a more reliable source of information and assistance than social media [83,85,86]. This study found only a very small proportion of respondents use emergency service apps for information. Therefore, these advanced technologies need to be actively promoted to younger generations as a more reliable alternative to using social media during a bushfire emergency. In the meantime, they also need to be informed that most applications still rely on the internet and telecommunications network to send and receive the information (see, VicEmergency and Hazard Near Me6).

This study has demonstrated a need for greater education surrounding bushfires, risk communication, and bushfire preparedness among university students in Australia. Firstly, this study demonstrated that one in three respondents have experienced a bushfire‐related evacuation. About 40% of respondents are also currently living or have lived in a bushfire risk area. Although most respondents were from South Australia where the city is geographically close to bushfire‐risk areas [6], this number still needs to be considered.

Bushfire education seems to be widely available to primary and secondary students in Australia through many state‐based programmes offered by volunteers and firefighters (see [26,74,89]), whereas there do not seem to be programmes of a similar type at Australian universities [31]. Although educational workshops may be a time‐consuming and costly exercise, providing such programmes has been found to be effective in educating university students on nature‐related safety [38,90]. To enhance the effectiveness, a new study has shown that consulting with attendees prior to workshops is also a helpful measure when deciding what information to present to particular audiences [90]. Other studies also highlight that establishing regular community‐run educational workshops helps with creating reliable emergency contact trees and providing clear direction in disaster communication, especially for CALD communities [20,24]. These regular community‐building programmes help to establish communities' trust with safety organisations and the trustworthiness of the information [91].

It is noted that considering the target audience when delivering bushfire risk communications and safety information is remarkably important [23]. For example, CALD populations whose first language is not English may be threatened by complicated safety language [20]. Although the number of international students in this study was limited, only 8 out of 14 international students had previous bushfire education. Considering the lack of bushfire knowledge among some domestic students and the lack of bushfire education among international students, bushfire safety information should be incorporated in university safety inductions, especially at those located in or near high‐risk areas. To deliver an effective safety message, universities can adopt these research‐backed methods and ensure that university students, including international students, can safely navigate bushfire seasons in Australia.

While this study explores bushfire knowledge and preparedness among university students in Australia, the majority of survey respondents were from South Australia. Some results may not be applicable in other states. This study also has a limited number of international students, who would have different experiences and possibly lack cultural knowledge of bushfires and safety management. Future studies could focus, for example, on New South Wales and Victoria, which have the highest population of international students in Australia [92]. This may allow a larger sample size and facilitate greater focus on cultural perceptions of students from different countries and any differences in bushfire knowledge and preparedness between domestic and international students.

This study investigated the experience, knowledge, and preparedness for possible bushfire events among university students in Australia. Although the majority of respondents had previously learned about bushfires and one in three students had experienced a bushfire evacuation, over 75% of respondents failed to recall the emergency phone number (triple 0) for bushfires. This study also found that university students favour social media applications such as Facebook for information gathering, rather than reliable emergency service applications. Considering this, advanced emergency service applications that do not require the internet or cellular connection should be promoted as a safer, more effective alternative to social media. Most importantly, universities and relevant safety organisations need to provide education to students not only in primary or secondary education but throughout tertiary education. Otherwise, young people who may live in or travel independently through bushfire‐risk areas will often do so without appropriate knowledge and preparation for the dangers they may face. This issue is becoming more and more urgent as these dangers are expected to increase in the coming decades due to climate change see [93,94,95].
