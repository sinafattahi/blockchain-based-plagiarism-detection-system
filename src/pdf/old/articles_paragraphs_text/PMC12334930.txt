Some patients with uveal melanoma (UM) show genetic cancer predisposition: ~2% harbor a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variant inBAP1or, rarely, in 20 other cancer‐associated genes. Up to 75% of patients with familial UM (FUM) lack genetic diagnosis, prompting a search beyondBAP1. We studied with exome sequencing blood samples from 106 patients with UM and higher‐than‐average risk of cancer (UM ≤ 45 years of age, bilateral or familial UM, or personal history of non‐ocular cancer) and no P/LP variants inBAP1. Sixteen (15%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9–23) patients carried at least one P/LP variant in dominant cancer genes (CHEK2,DDX41,FANCM,HOXB13,RAD50,SDHA, SDHB) and fifteen in recessive ones. OnlyCHEK2andFANCMhave previously been reported in patients with UM. Six patients (6%; 95% CI 2–12) carried multilocus P/LP variants. Their median age at diagnosis of UM was 51 (range, 22–69) years, 9 years less than the cohort median of 60 (range, 13–89). This suggests a role for co‐occurring pathogenic variants and potentially multilocus inherited neoplasia allele syndrome (MINAS) in UM predisposition. None with FUM carried P/LP variants, warranting investigation of further genes, lower penetrance variants, and multi‐gene heterozygosity in UM predisposition.

Germline exome sequencing of 106 Finnish patients with UM, considered at higher risk for genetic cancer predisposition, identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants associated with varying risk of malignancies in 16 patients (15%). Six patients (6%) carried multiple variants and had a median diagnosis age of 51, compared to 60 in the full cohort and 65 in a larger consecutive series.

We studied with exome sequencing106 Finnish patients with uveal melanoma (UM) for pathogenic germline variants in cancer‐associated genes.

Patient selection criteria included UM ≤ 45 years of age, bilateral or familial UM, or other non‐ocular cancer.

Sixteen (15%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9–23) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in dominant cancer genes, includingCHEK2,DDX41,FANCM,HOXB13,RAD50,SDHA, andSDHB.

Six (6%; 95% CI 2–12) carried two or more variants in dominant and/or recessive cancer genes and developed UM 9 years earlier than the cohort median of 60 (range 13–89), suggesting a potential role for multiple co‐occurring variants in UM pathogenesis.

In 12% of patients with uveal melanoma (UM), the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults, personal or family cancer history suggests possible cancer predisposition (Abdel‐Rahman et al.2010), and 1%–4% of all patients report familial UM (FUM) (Abdel‐Rahman et al.2010; Singh et al.1996; Repo et al.2019).BAP1is the only high‐penetrance UM susceptibility gene identified to date, and pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants inBAP1are identified in 2% of all patients with UM and up to one‐quarter of those with FUM (Abdel‐Rahman et al.2010; Repo et al.2019; Gupta et al.2015; Rai et al.2017). The dominant BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1‐TPDS) predisposes individuals to several cancers in addition to UM, including especially mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma (CM), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and possibly less frequently to several other cancers (Carbone et al.2022; Pilarski et al.2016; Albright et al.2023; Prasad et al.2021).

Aside fromBAP1, isolated patients with UM have so far been reported to carry P/LP germline variants in 20 genes associated with a dominant risk of various cancers (Cruz et al.2011; Johansson et al.2025; Repo et al.2024; Palles et al.2022; Iscovich et al.2002; Sinilnikova et al.1999; Huang et al.2018; Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020; Hajkova et al.2018; Lobo et al.2017; Hearle et al.2003; Kannengiesser et al.2003; Fontcuberta et al.2011; Nathan et al.2021; Derrien et al.2021; Johansson et al.2019; Rodrigues et al.2018). One percent of French patients harbor a protein‐truncating germline variant inMBD4, linked to a recessive tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by acute myeloid leukemia, colorectal adenomatous polyposis, and UM (Palles et al.2022; Derrien et al.2021; Villy et al.2023). Additionally, heterozygous French carriers are reported to have a 9.15‐fold increased risk of developing UM (Derrien et al.2021). Patients withMBD4loss benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, making their identification important for patient care (Johansson et al.2019; Rodrigues et al.2018; Saint‐Ghislain et al.2022). Of the remaining 19 genes (Table1), further evidence for a role in predisposition to UM exists forCDKN2A,MLH1, MSH6, andPALB2based on their inactivation in UM or its metastases (Huang et al.2018; Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020; Lobo et al.2017; Kannengiesser et al.2003; Derrien et al.2021; Johansson et al.2019; Rodrigues et al.2018). Details of the numerousBAP1andMBD4variants have been summarized in previous publications (Carbone et al.2022; Derrien et al.2021; Villy et al.2023). Moreover, three carriers of two P/LP variants in cancer genes have been reported (Johansson et al.2025; Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020), potentially fitting the new concept of multilocus inherited neoplasia allele syndrome (MINAS) (Whitworth et al.2016; McGuigan et al.2022).

Previously published pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic (LP) germline variants in patients with UM in genes associated with dominant cancer or tumor predisposition.

Note:The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification (Richards et al.2015) was assigned using Varsome. Only variants interpreted as P/LP, according to present knowledge, are listed. Variant nomenclature may differ from the original publication due to the used transcript. Interpretation may have changed due to alterations in classification guidelines or later information. Genes/variants highlighted in bold are supported by additional evidence of association with primary UM or their metastasis, such as loss of heterozygosity or immunostaining results.

The incidence of UM in Europe and North America is about four times as high in Northern than Southern latitudes, including Finland (Kivelä2014), where the frequency of P/LPBAP1variants is no more frequent than elsewhere and where predisposition to FUM remains unresolved for at least 75% of families (Repo et al.2019). To discover further genetic entities predisposing to UM, we performed exome sequencing to analyze cancer‐associated germline variants in Finnish UM patients at higher‐than‐average risk of inherited cancer predisposition but lacking P/LPBAP1germline variants.

Eligible participants were Finnish‐born patients diagnosed with UM in the Ocular Oncology Service, Helsinki University Hospital, a national referral center for eye cancer in Finland, who were (1) ≤ 45 years at the time of UM diagnosis, (2) had a non‐ocular primary cancer before or after UM, (3) bilateral UM, or (4) familial UM. Data on personal and family history of cancer were collected upon enrollment and were available for 521 Finnish patients consecutively diagnosed with UM between 2010 and 2017 (Repo et al.2019). Eleven foreign patients were not eligible. Eight patients with previously identified P/LP germline variants inBAP1were excluded and reported elsewhere (Repo et al.2019; Turunen et al.2016). Altogether, 92 patients met our enrollment criteria, were willing to participate, and had donated a sample at the time of the study. Additionally, 14 Finnish patients diagnosed with UM before 2010 or after 2017 were enrolled based on UM diagnosed at < 25 years of age, familial UM, or additional diagnosis of RCC, the most frequent of the non‐ocular cancers associated with BAP1‐TPDS (Repo et al.2024). The cohort overlaps with cohorts of previous studies (FigureS1). The project was approved by the institutional review board of the Hospital Region of Helsinki and Uusimaa on June 11, 2012, and it followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was given by all patients who were eligible and chose to participate in the study.

Genomic DNA from the 106 enrolled high‐risk patients was extracted from peripheral whole blood using standard methods. Libraries were prepared using either the Twist EF kit with Twist Core Exome kit (both from Twist Bioscience, San Francisco, CA) or Kapa Hyper Sample Prep with NimbleGen SeqCap EZ MedExome kit (both from Roche Nimblegen, WI) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq or NovaSeq platforms (San Diego, CA). Exome sequencing, read alignment to Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37) and variant calling were performed by the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM, Helsinki, Finland) (Sulonen et al.2011). Variants were annotated with Annotate Variation (ANNOVAR) (Wang et al.2010).

We selected 241 genes associated with BAP1, UM, or other cancers for analysis (TableS1). Gene selection was done using literature, Genomics England PanelApp available athttps://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/, the STRING database (Szklarczyk et al.2019), and the Cancer Gene Census database (Sondka et al.2018). Variants with read depth less than 10 and variant allele frequency (VAF) < 30% were excluded. Variants reported as P/LP in ClinVar and nonsynonymous variants with MAF < 0.001 in gnomAD v2.1.1 (Karczewski et al.2020) predicted as deleterious by MetaRNN (Li et al.2022) were included unless reported as benign or likely benign. VarSome (Kopanos et al.2019) was used to assign the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classifications (Richards et al.2015) to the remaining variants. Variants in tables 2–3 were inspected manually with Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Robinson et al.2011). RStudio version 2025.05.0 (build 496) was used to calculate odds ratios for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants occurring in multiple individuals by comparing UM cohort data to the Finnish gnomAD v2.1.1 cohort by Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data. Carrier frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using the modified Wald method.

The median age at diagnosis of the 106 patients with UM who met our criteria for being at higher‐than‐average risk of inherited cancer predisposition was 60 years (range 13–89; TableS2). The percentage of patients who were 45 years or younger was 34%, those with FUM 12%, and those with at least one non‐ocular primary malignancy 60%. The most frequent other cancers were prostate (27% of men), breast (31% of women, all affected females), and RCC, typically clear cell type (11%).

Thirteen patients from 10 families had a family history of UM. Among them, 3 had an affected first‐degree relative, whereas 10 had a more distant relative who was affected (cousin, second cousin, or more distant). Three (23%) of them had a history of one non‐ocular primary cancer: two had an RCC, and one had metastatic adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary. Similarly, among the 36 patients 45 years or younger, 3 (8%) had a history of one non‐ocular cancer (CM, thyroid carcinoma, and Hodgkin's disease), and one had bilateral UM (at the age of 42 and 65 years).

Four patients reported a family history of cancers other than UM. A patient with thyroid carcinoma at 49 and UM at 65 reported a sister with breast cancer, another affected by gynecological cancer, and a brother with stomach or pancreatic cancer. Another patient affected by CM at 40, UM at 61, and rectal carcinoma at 65 had a child affected by CM. The third patient with bladder carcinoma at 52 and UM at 69 had a brother deceased of CM, two sisters with unspecified cancers, and an aunt with renal cancer. The fourth had a family history of CM and breast cancer, with no further details available.

We identified P/LP germline variants in dominant cancer‐associated genes in 16 of the 106 patients (15%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9–23). The variants were found inCHEK2(9 patients),DDX41,FANCM(3 patients),HOXB13(3 patients),RAD50(2 patients),SDHA, andSDHB, linked with varying degrees of dominantly inherited cancer risk (Table2). Additionally, 15 patients carried P/LP variants in genes associated with recessive cancer risk, includingBLM,CTC1(2 patients),EXO1(2 patients),FANCI,GBA1,NTHL1(2 patients),RECQL4,RMPR,SBDS(3 patients),TRIM37, andWRN(Table3). Six patients (6%; 95% CI, 2–12) harbored multiple P/LP variants in dominant (3 patients) or recessive (1 patient) cancer genes, or both (2 patients) (Tables2and3, FigureS2). Identified variants classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS) are listed in TableS3.

Three females carried the commonCHEK2variant c.470T>C; p.(Ile157Thr), along with an additional variant inSDHB,FANCM, orHOXB13(Table2). PathogenicCHEK2variants cause a dominant risk of breast, prostate, colorectal, and possibly other cancers (Kilpivaara et al.2004; Stolarova et al.2020; Breast Cancer Association Consortium et al.2021). TheCHEK2c.470T>C variant is a low‐risk cancer variant (Hanson et al.2023). It is classified as pathogenic (5), likely pathogenic (13), pathogenic with low penetrance (1), established risk allele (1), and of uncertain significance (9) in the ClinVar database. The first patient, diagnosed with a T3a, stage IIB UM at 22, also carried a pathogenicSDHBc.716_719delCTCT; p.(Ser239Tyrfs*7) variant, associated with paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and RCC (Vanharanta et al.2004; MacFarlane et al.2020). The second, diagnosed with a T2a, stage IIA UM at 41, was additionally heterozygous for a pathogenicFANCMc.5101C>T; p.(Gln1701*) variant associated with a 2‐fold breast cancer risk (Kiiski et al.2014; Foulkes2021). The third, diagnosed with a pulmonary carcinoid tumor and a T3a, stage IIB UM at the ages of 64 and 66, respectively, carried theHOXB13c.251G>A; p.(Gly84Glu) variant linked to low risk of prostate and possibly other cancers in males (Wei et al.2020). The variant is classified in ClinVar as pathogenic (11), likely pathogenic (7), and of uncertain significance (1) (Table2, FigureS2).

A male, with a T3a, stage IIB, UM at age 45 years, was heterozygous for the dominantly inherited likely pathogenicSDHAc.1210C>T; p.(Pro404Ser) variant and theBLMc.2824‐2A>T variant, associated with recessive Bloom syndrome (Tables2and3, FigureS2). He had previously been reported to have theBLMvariant (Repo et al.2024), while theSDHAvariant was discovered after exome sequencing. PathogenicSDHAvariants predispose to paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, and RCC, albeit with lower penetrance thanSDHBvariants (MacFarlane et al.2020; Maniam et al.2018). Patients with Bloom syndrome, characterized by short stature, narrow face, and red skin rash, are predisposed to various cancers at an early age. In contrast, the cancer risk for heterozygous carriers is pending confirmation (Cunniff et al.2017; Bononi et al.2020).

Another male, diagnosed with RCC at 56 and a T3a, stage IIB, UM at 57, was heterozygous for pathogenic variants c.1390+2del inRECQL4and c.258+2 T>C inSBDS(Table3, FigureS2). TheRECQL4variant is associated with recessive multisystem RAPADILINO, Rothmund‐Thomson, and Baller‐Gerold syndromes with a risk of osteosarcoma and lymphoma (Siitonen et al.2009). TheSBDSvariant is common in recessive Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome with a risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (Nelson and Myers1993).

Finally, a male patient was heterozygous for three pathogenic variants: c.1100delC; p.(Thr367Metfs*15) inCHEK2, c.687delT; p.(Ser229Argfs*6) inRAD50, and c.3019del; p.(Leu1007Cysfs*62) inCTC1(Tables2and3, FigureS2). The patient had a bladder carcinoma at 52 years and a T2a, stage IIA, UM at 69 years. His brother had CM, two other first‐degree relatives had unspecified malignancies, and a maternal aunt had renal tumors. The pathogenicCHEK2variant carries a 2‐fold cancer risk (Kilpivaara et al.2004; Breast Cancer Association Consortium et al.2021), while the pathogenicRAD50Finnish founder variant is a hypothesized low‐penetrance breast cancer susceptibility allele (Heikkinen et al.2006). Compound heterozygousCTC1variants cause cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts (Polvi et al.2012; Anderson et al.2012) andCTC1is included in Genomics England PanelApp's hematological malignancy genepanel (Shen et al.2019; Furutani and Shimamura2017).

Four variants,CHEK2c.470T>C; p.(Ile157Thr),FANCMc.5101C>T; p.(Gln1701*),HOXB13c.251G>A; p.(Gly84Glu), andRAD50c.687delT; p.(Ser229Argfs*6), enriched in the Finnish population (gnomAD MAF > 0.001), were each identified as the only P/LP variant in five, two, two, and one patient, respectively. When including carriers of multiple variants, the odds ratios (OR) were all > 1, being 1.53 (95% CI; 0.65–3.09,p= 0.26) forCHEK2, 1.76 (95% CI; 0.36–5.29,p= 0.25) forFANCM, 1.24 (95% CI; 0.15–4.6,p= 0.68) forHOXB13, and 2.11 (95% CI; 0.25–7.88,p= 0.25) forRAD50, respectively (TableS4). Additionally, a pathogenic variant c.415_418dupGATG inDDX41was identified in a female with myotonic dystrophy, thyroid and renal cysts, and a T2a, stage IIA, UM at age 41 years. Myotonic dystrophy increases the risk of cancer (Emparanza et al.2018), and a risk of UM is speculated (Guneri Beser and Demirci2024; Velazquez‐Martin et al.2013; Dalvin et al.2018). The patient had a family history of CM and breast cancer. The variant is associated with a low‐to‐moderate risk of myelo‐ and lymphoproliferative neoplasms (Bannon et al.2020). However, IGV inspection showed an allele frequency of 21%, suggesting a possible somatic origin of the variant (Table2, FigureS2).

To our knowledge, P/LP germline variants inDDX41,HOXB13,RAD50,SDHA, andSDHBin patients with UM are novel findings. Without tumor biopsies, a limitation of our study, the germline variants' role in UM tumorigenesis remains open. TheHOXB13c.251G>A,RAD50c.687delT, andCHEK2c.470 T>C variants are linked to the prostate (Wei et al.2020), breast (Heikkinen et al.2006), or both (Hanson et al.2023) cancers, are relatively common in Finland and may appear in our cohort by chance. However, their co‐occurrence with another pathogenic variant is less likely, warranting further studies in larger UM cohorts. The OR of the variants observed in multiple individuals must be considered exploratory, given that they are not statistically significant as compared to the Finnish population in gnomAD (TableS4), which reflects the small numbers of patients available from a rare cancer in a small population of 5.6 million. As we failed to resolve the genetic background of additional Finnish patients with FUM not linked to BAP1‐TPDS (Repo et al.2019; Turunen et al.2016), mutatedBAP1remains the main monogenic UM risk factor.

Our results replicate two previously reported UM‐associated germline discoveries. The otherCHEK2variant, c.1100delC p.(Thr367Metfs*15), was identified in Ohio in a patient with UM, RCC, and basal cell carcinoma, as well as a family history of CM and breast cancer (Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020). A likely pathogenicFANCMvariant c.636dup; p.(Ile213Tyrfs*2) was found in a male UM patient from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (Huang et al.2018). Of note, the association ofFANCMwith dominant cancer risk remains unconfirmed (Kiiski et al.2014; Morales‐Pison et al.2023; Kiiski et al.2017; Figlioli et al.2023).

No deleterious germlineMBD4variants were identified in Finnish patients with UM, consistent with our previous study on an overlapping cohort (FigureS1) (Repo et al.2020). We also identified no P/LP germline variants inATM,ATR,BRCA1,BRCA2,BRIP1,CDKN2A,CTNNA1,FANCD2,FLCN,MET,MITF,MLH1,MSH6,NBN,PALB2,POT1, orSMARCE1, previously reported in patients with UM (Table1) (Cruz et al.2011; Repo et al.2024; Iscovich et al.2002; Sinilnikova et al.1999; Huang et al.2018; Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020; Hajkova et al.2018; Lobo et al.2017; Hearle et al.2003; Kannengiesser et al.2003; Fontcuberta et al.2011; Nathan et al.2021; Johansson et al.2025).

Genetic testing is increasingly performed using gene panels and exome sequencing, leading to a growing number of patients identified with multiple cancer risk variants. Such patients, now thought to have MINAS, can exhibit overlapping or more severe or atypical cancer phenotypes due to additive or synergistic effects of variants (Whitworth et al.2016; McGuigan et al.2022). However, the co‐occurrence of multiple cancer‐associated variants is rare; in Finland, the estimated frequency of double heterozygotes in dominant cancer genes without phenotypic selection is 0.25% (Laitman et al.2024). Nevertheless, six Finnish patients with UM (6% of all patients; 21% of carriers of P/LP variants) had co‐occurring variants, with a 3.8% frequency when considered only dominant cancer genes (Table2). ThoughCHEK2variants have been reported in MINAS patients (McGuigan et al.2022; Laitman et al.2024), the c.470 T>C may not qualify as MINAS‐causing due to its low associated risk. Comparing MINAS frequencies across studies poses challenges due to the lack of uniform reporting guidelines.

The median age at UM diagnosis for multilocus variant carriers was 51 years (range, 22–69), compared to 60 in the entire cohort and 65 (range, 15–90) in our overlapping larger consecutive series (Repo et al.2019). This aligns with BAP1‐TPDS, where the median UM diagnosis age is 53–54 years, compared to the general median of 62–65 years (Repo et al.2019; Pilarski et al.2016; Walpole et al.2018), and two previously reported patients with UM and multilocus variants (Johansson et al.2025; Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020). A younger‐than‐average patient with UM (51 years), with a family history of pancreatic, breast, and colon carcinoma, was identified in Ohio as a carrier ofCHEK2c.470T>C; p.(Ile157Thr)—also found in three of our patients—and a pathogenicPALB2c.49‐1G>A (Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020). Another patient from the same study, diagnosed with UM at an even younger age of 46, carried an LPSMARCE1c.373G>T; p.(Glu123*) variant and an LPMHS6(NM_000179.3) c.3495C>G p.(Cys1165Trp) missense variant (Table1), originally classified (Abdel‐Rahman et al.2020) as a VUS [note that original publication nomenclature c.2589C>G; p.(Cys863Trp) falls in alternative transcripts]. The patient developed endometrial cancer at 51 and had a family history of UM and non‐melanoma skin cancer. Nuclear SMARCE1 staining was detected in both index tumors, whereas MSH6 staining was reduced or absent. Third, a male patient from Australia carried a pathogenicBRIP1variant c.2392C>T p.(Arg798*) and another pathogenic variant c.3226C>T p.(Arg1076Cys) inMSH6(Johansson et al.2025). He was diagnosed with UM at 39 and cutaneous melanoma at 47. He also reported two first‐ or second‐degree relatives affected by cutaneous melanoma, mucosal melanoma, astrocytoma, and thyroid cancer, though further details were not specified. Additionally, the patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic recessiveTYRvariant c.1118C>A p.(Thr373Lys) associated with oculocutaneous albinism, but speculated to contribute also to cutaneous melanoma risk (Nathan et al.2019).

Beyond the lack of tumor biopsies, our study has additional limitations. First, we aimed to identify novel UM predisposition genes and excluded patients with pathogenic germlineBAP1variants, preventing the assessment of multilocus variants in these individuals. Second, short‐read sequencing and filtering criteria might have missed pathogenic variants such as large copy‐number changes. Additionally, variant classifications may change with new data. Lastly, gender, wide age range, and early mortality of patients with high‐risk UM can introduce bias in enrollment and follow‐up for non‐ocular cancers.

In conclusion, the 6% frequency of multilocus variant carriers in our selected cohort was high, comparable to the 3.2% frequency of BAP1‐TPDS in Finnish patients with UM diagnosed before the age of 50 years (Repo et al.2019). Therefore, we propose genetic testing beyondBAP1for UM patients diagnosed at 45 years of age or younger, those with additional non‐ocular cancers, FUM, or a strong family history of cancer. The emerging concept of MINAS informs new research directions into the genetic basis of UM and may have implications for individual patient care. While the synergistic effect of multiple variants remains speculative, surveillance strategies and risk‐reducing measures should be guided by established recommendations for each individual finding, considering the spectrum of malignancies associated with each pathogenic variant. Nonetheless, identifying a pathogenic variant, regardless of multiplicity, can be clinically significant and warrants appropriate management. Further genetic entities may remain undiscovered, explaining still unresolved FUM.
