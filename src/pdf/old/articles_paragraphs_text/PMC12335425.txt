The synergistic function between ferroptosis and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has gained significant attention, but their relationship remains unclear. This study explores their roles and mechanisms in ovarian cancer progression, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets.

From public databases, 4410 immune-related ovarian genes and 483 ferroptosis-related genes were collected. Using bioinformatics analysis, CYBB was identified as a key gene strongly associated with macrophage infiltration and ferroptosis. The immune infiltration of CYBB in ovarian cancer was evaluated using TIMER2, TISIDB, linkedOmics, GEPIA2, and TISCH databases. The expression and function of CYBB in ovarian cancer were further validated through in vitro cellular assays. Through establishing an in vitro TAMs co-culture model, we investigated the role of CYBB in modulating macrophage polarization.

Our findings revealed that CYBB is highly expressed in ovarian cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Single-cell sequencing indicated that CYBB is predominantly expressed in macrophages, and enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes co-expressed with CYBB are primarily involved in macrophage activation. Through in vitro experiments, we found that CYBB influences ovarian cancer cell proliferation and erastin-induced ferroptosis. In TAMs, CYBB knockdown increased ferroptosis-related proteins (FTH-1,FSP1). Notably, CYBB knockout suppressed the expression of M1 macrophage markers while promoting the upregulation of M2 marker expression.

CYBB has prognostic and clinical significance in Ovarian cancer, playing a key role in the immune microenvironment by regulating macrophage infiltration and ferroptosis.

Ovarian cancer(OC) is one of the most malignant gynecological tumors. In 2022, the incidence rate of OC in Chinese women ranked 9th, 0.088‰; The mortality rate is the 9th, 0.047‰ [1]. Due to the lack of effective screening tools, 75% of OC has diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease [2]. An epidemiological study collected data from 61 countries, the 5-year survival rate of OC is only 30–50% [3]. Therefore, investigating diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets is crucial for the treatment of OC.Ferroptosis, a recently discovered regulated cell death mechanism, is defined by the dysfunction of the lipid repair enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). This impairment results in the excessive accumulation of lipid-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), with a pronounced increase in lipid hydroperoxides. In the field of oncology, ferroptosis can induce inflammation-associated immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, thereby favoring tumor growth, such as in OC [4]. Over the past decade, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) representing the most abundant immune population in the tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising about 50% of hematopoietic cells and displaying functional heterogeneity from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles [5]. As the predominant infiltrating immune cells in cancers such as lung, kidney, breast, and OC, TAMs play a central role in immune regulation by fostering a pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic environment through the suppression of anti-tumor immune responses [6–8].

Tumor initiation and progression are not solely regulated by a single pathway; targeting a single signaling axis or gene receptor is insufficient to exert a definitive impact on cancer cells. The complex interplay between ferroptosis, TAMs, and interactions within the adaptive and innate immune systems remains incompletely understood and warrants further investigation as a focal point for future research. This study focuses on elucidating the synergistic interaction between ferroptosis and macrophages in OC, aiming for a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the roles of these two mechanisms in the progression of OC, and finding a potential therapeutic target for OC.

Through analysis of public bioinformatics databases, this study identifies CYBB as a potential predictor of OC prognosis, with its regulatory mechanisms likely linked to macrophage infiltration and ferroptosis in OC patients. These findings will be further discussed in this paper.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://genomecancer.ucsc.edu/) is a publicly accessible data. Using TCGA tools, RNA-Seq expression data from 379 OC patients were acquired. The ferroptosis-related gene was collected from FerrDb V2 (http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb) [9]. The tumor-infiltrating immune cells were acquired from TIP(Tracking Tumor Immunophenotype,http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/TIP/) [10].

WGCNA systematically groups genes with similar expression patterns into distinct modules, transforming complex expression data into interpretable networks [11]. Gene expression data from TCGA-OV and TIP were normalized using signed WGCNA implemented in the R package. After excluding genes with the lowest variance (bottom quartile), we identified 4,410 common genes across both datasets for subsequent analysis.The gene co-expression network was constructed and visualized using the WGCNA package in R. We selected a soft-thresholding power (β) that achieved a scale-free topology fit of 0.9, with a minimum module size of 100 genes. Module clustering was visualized through a dendrogram, with highly similar dynamic modules merged at a cut height of 0.2. This process yielded 21 modules, including a gray module containing unassigned genes.Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess module-trait associations with immune scores. Key immune-related genes were identified using thresholds of Gene Significance (GS) > 0.5 and Module Membership (MM) > 0.7. The black module, which showed significant association with immune cell recruitment, was selected for further investigation.

The relationship between CYBB expression and clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated in 88 OC patients and 8 normal ovarian tissue patients from Shanghai General Hospital.88 OC patients were enrolled, including 49 serous, 4 mucinous, 14 endometrioid OC specimens, 9 clear cell carcinoma, 6 metastatic cancer and 6 ovarian borderline cancer. Follow-up and prognostic data of all these patients were collected. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai General Hospital Animal Ethics Committee (Approval No. K-2024-115).

To identify ferroptosis-related genes and their association with immune infiltration, we analyzed the TCGA-OV dataset and visualized the results using heatmaps. PPI network was constructed using the STRING database (https://string-db.org/) [12], with an interaction score threshold of > 0.9. From the 97 DEGs integrated into the PPI network, the hub gene CYBB was selected using the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape (version 3.8.2). Functional enrichment analysis of CYBB was subsequently performed using the LinkedOmics platform (www.linkedomics.org) [13].

We employed GEPIA2 [14] to analyze CYBB expression in OC and utilized the KM plotter (http://kmplot.com) to evaluate its prognostic in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [15].

Single-cell sequencing datasets were obtained from the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH,http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/) following the platform’s guidelines [16]. To investigate the relationship between CYBB expression and immune infiltration, we employed the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER,https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/) and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER2.0,http://timer.cistrome.org/) [17]. Additionally, the TISIDB database (http://cis.hku.hk/TISIDB/) was utilized to validate correlations between CYBB expression and immune cell subsets [18].

IHC staining for CYBB(1:1000, Proteintech, China), GPX4(1:1000, Affinity, China) and CD68 (1:100,Abcam, UK)was performed as below. IHC was performed on tissue sections following the manufacturer’s protocol. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control by replacing the primary antibody, and diaminobenzidine (DAB) was employed for color development. The staining results for CYBB, GPX4, and CD68 were evaluated based on both staining intensity and the percentage of positive tumor cells. Staining intensity was scored as 0 (no staining), 1 (light yellow), 2 (buff), or 3 (brown). The percentage of positive cells was assessed in five randomly selected high-power fields and scored as 0 (< 5%), 1 (5–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), or 4 (> 75%). The final score, calculated by multiplying the intensity and percentage scores, ranged from 0 to 12. Scores were categorized as follows: 0 (negative), 1–4 (weak expression), 5–8 (moderate expression), and 9–12 (strong expression).

OVCAR3, SKOV3 and THP-1 were acquired from the National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (Shanghai, China). OVCAR3 were cultured in 1640 medium(GIBCO, American) with 10% fetal bovine serum(GIBCO, American) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin(MCE, American). SKOV3 cells were cultured in McCoy5A medium(GIBCO, American) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. THP-1 cells were cultured in 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol (MCE, American). The cells were cultured in a growth environment of 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a CO2-Incubator.

Human CYBB small interfering RNA(siRNA) were synthesized and prepared by Tsingke(Beijing, China), The sequences as followed: GGCUGUGCAUAAUAUAACA. siRNA transfection was performed on the cells utilizing Lipofectamine 3000(Invitrogen, American). Transfected cells were collected 48 h later for Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) or Western blotting. Knockdown efficacy was validated by RT-qPCR and Western blots.

Total RNA was extracted using the RNA extraction kit (Vazyme, China), reverse-transcribed into cDNA with SuperMix (Vazyme, China), and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers under standard cycling conditions. The mRNA expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and quantified using the 2-ΔΔCt method [19]. The primer sequences for RT-qPCR can be found in TableS1.

Proteins were extracted from cells using RIPA buffer(Beyotime, China), separated by SDS-PAGE(Epizyme, China), and transferred to PVDF membranes(Epizyme, China). The membranes were blocked with Rapid Blocking Buffer (Epizyme, China), incubated with primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (BioVision, USA)detection system.

Anti- CYBB antibody (19013-1-AP; Proteintech, China ) diluted to 1:1000.

Anti- GPX4 antibody (DF6701; Affinity, China) diluted to 1:1000.

Anti- FTH1 antibody (11682-1-AP; Proteintech, China) diluted to 1:1000.

Anti-GAPDH antibody (60004-1-lg; Proteintech, China) diluted to 1:50000.

Anti-rabbit (SA00001-2; Proteintech, China) diluted to 1:2000.

Anti-mouse (SA00001-1; Proteintech, China) diluted to 1:2000.

To evaluate the role of CYBB in ferroptosis, we transfer the CYBB siRNAs into SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells (at 40–50% confluence) for 24 h, Then the transferred SKOV3 and OVCAR3 were treated with erastin(MCE, American) for an additional 24–48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Beyotime, China).

The transfected OVCAR3 Cells were seeded at 800 cells per well in six-well plates, cultured for 10–14 days, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min and then stained with crystal violet solution (Beyotime, China) for an additional 15 min.

THP-1 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PMA (MCE, China) for 48 h to induce M0 macrophage differentiation. We further polarized these M0 macrophages into M2 macrophages by stimulating them with 20 ng/ml IL-13 (MCE, China) and 20 ng/ml IL-4 (MCE, China) for 48 h. The M0 macrophages were then co-cultured with OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells in a 6-well transwell chamber (pore size: 0.4 μm; NEST, China) for 48 h. After co-culturing, the macrophages were collected for RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis.

χ² tests were applied for categorical variable comparisons between CYBB high- and low-expression groups; independent two-sample t-tests were conducted for continuous variables between ovarian cancer and normal tissues; Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated with log-rank testing; and Spearman’s rank correlation analyses were performed to evaluate associations between CYBB and markers. All statistical tests were conducted using SPSS (version 20.0) or GraphPad Prism (version 8.0), with two-tailed p-values < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

The brief workflow of this research is exhibited in in Fig.1. We obtained the gene expression levels of immune cells from TCGA followed by consensus clustering for TIP immune cells. Then, 21 modules were clustered (Fig.2a) by calculating correlations between gene modules and immune subgroups and merging substantially identical gene modules, the black module was selected for further analysis due to their association with immune cell recruitment, which containing 4410 genes. Finally, utilizing the vennplot, we got 97 DEGs from the 4410 integrated genes and 483 genes from FerrDb V2(Fig.2b). For understanding the interactions among the 97 DEGs, PPI network was constructed using the intersecting of the 97 genes, 10 hub genes were obtained by the degree, including IL1B, STAT3, TLR4, PPARG, HMOX1, SIRT1, IFNG, CYBB, SQSTM1and CD44(Fig.2c).

Using WGCNA, we identified 10 hub genes and ranked their module membership (MM) within the black module and gene significance (GS) for macrophage recruitment (Table S2). Correlation heatmap analysis revealed associations between these 10 hub genes, the cancer immunity cycle, and macrophages (Fig.3a). Among these, CYBB demonstrated a strong positive correlations with macrophages, T cells, CD8 T cells, TH1 cells, and NK cells. Further analysis of macrophage polarization revealed that CYBB was positively correlated with both M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes (Fig.3b). After analyzing differential expression of the 10 hub genes in ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues (Fig.3c) and the prognostic significance (Fig.3d), CYBB was ultimately identified as the hub gene.

TNMplot database revealed that CYBB expression is significantly upregulated in multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), and colorectal cancer (CRC) and son on(Fig.4a). CYBB expression is significantly higher in OC tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. (Fig.4b). To assess the clinical significance of CYBB in OC, we analyzed 88 OC tissue samples and 8 normal ovarian tissue controls using IHC (Fig.4c). Results showed significantly higher CYBB expression in cancer tissues compared to normal controls (p< 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed significant expression differences across various pathological types, including serous ovarian cancer, endometrioid cancer, and clear cell cancer (Fig.4d). CYBB expression correlated significantly with pathological type (p< 0.05) and age (p< 0.05), with higher expression in patients over 50 years old. However, no significant correlation was found between CYBB expression and tumor stage (p= 0.714) or histological grade (p= 0.53) (Table1).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of CYBB expression in TCGA and GEO databases revealed significant correlations with both PFS and OS in OC. In datasetsGSE63885,GSE9891, andGSE2355, high CYBB expression was associated with poor OS, and similar results were found in TCGA,GSE9891, andGSE65986(Fig.5a). And CYBB exhibited notable prognostic value across various histological types and differentiation levels. High CYBB expression correlated with poor prognosis in both well-differentiated (GSE30161) and poorly differentiated (GSE63885) OC, as well as in early (GSE26193) and advanced (GSE9891) stages. Additionally, CYBB had prognostic significance in serous ovarian carcinoma (Fig.5a). A survival analysis of 88 OC patients confirmed that CYBB is significantly associated with OS, but no significant association in serous carcinoma (Fig.5b).

Enrichment analysis (LinkedOmics) showed that CYBB is significantly enriched in adaptive immune response, macrophage activation, and immune response regulation pathways(Fig.6a). TIMER analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between CYBB and various immune cells, including B cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Fig.6b). Further analysis in the TISCH2 database across 9 OC datasets (OV_GSE115007, OV_GSE118828, OV_EMTAB8107, OV_GSE130000, OV_GSE147082, OV_GSE151214, OV_GSE154600, OV_GSE154763, OV_GSE158722) showed that CYBB expression was highest in monocytes/macrophages, followed by dendritic cells (DCs), with lower expression in CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and B cells(Fig.6c). UMAP figure also revealed prominent CYBB expression in macrophages (Fig.6d). In the EMTAB8107 dataset, CYBB expression differed significantly between OC and normal ovarian tissues, with the most notable difference in macrophages, while no significant differences were found in T cells and B cells (Fig.6e). The results showed that CYBB may have a specific biological association with macrophages, potentially influencing tumor microenvironment through macrophage polarization or functional regulation.

In the GEPIA database, CYBB expression was analyzed across different macrophage subtypes. Results showed that in ovarian tumor tissues, CYBB expression was higher in M2 macrophages compared to normal ovarian tissue (p< 0.001), followed by M0 and M1 macrophages (Fig.7a). Additionally, CYBB expression was significantly elevated in all macrophage subtypes in OC versus normal tissue (p< 0.001) (Fig.7a), supporting the specific expression of CYBB in tumor-associated macrophages. According to the TIMER database, CYBB exhibited a strong positive correlation with M0, M1, and M2 macrophages (Fig.7b), indicating that CYBB could be critically involved in the recruitment, polarization, and functional regulation of macrophages.

To explore the involvement of CYBB in ferroptosis in OC, we analyzed the correlation between CYBB and ferroptosis markers in TIMER2 databases. The results showed that in TIMER2, CYBB was significantly positively correlated with ferroptosis markers ACSL4 (rho = 0.266,p< 0.0001), GPX4 (rho = 0.207,p< 0.0001), FTH1 (rho = 0.375,p< 0.0001), and PTGS2 (rho = 0.249,p< 0.0001).(Fig.8a).

Further analysis revealed a stronger correlation between CYBB and macrophage markers. In OC, CYBB was significantly positively correlated with M1 macrophage marker CD80 (rho = 0.717,p< 0.0001) and M2 markers CD68 (rho = 0.925,p< 0.0001), CD163 (rho = 0.897,p< 0.0001), CD200R1 (rho = 0.690,p< 0.0001), and CD209 (rho = 0.625,p< 0.0001) (Fig.8a).

To confirm these findings, immunohistochemistry for GPX4 and CD68 was performed on 88 OC samples((Fig.8b), showing that high CYBB expression was associated with high GPX4 and CD68 expression, and low CYBB expression with lower GPX4 and CD68 levels. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between CYBB and GPX4 (rho = 0.5466,p< 0.0001) and CD68 (rho = 0.5421,p< 0.0001) (Fig.8c, d), confirming the association of CYBB with ferroptosis and macrophage markers in OC.

To further verify the relationship between CYBB and ferroptosis, we knocked down CYBB expression in OC cells using siRNA, and confirmed knockdown efficiency by RT-qPCR and Western blot (Fig.9A). Colony formation assays showed that CYBB knockdown significantly reduced colony numbers (Fig.9B), suggesting that CYBB promotes OC cell proliferation.

After transfection of SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells, different concentrations of Erastin were added, and cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. The results showed that CYBB knockdown significantly reduced the sensitivity of SKOV3 and OVCAR3 OC cells to Erastin (Fig.9c), suggesting that CYBB knockdown may weaken Erastin-induced ferroptosis.

To investigate the regulatory role of CYBB in macrophage polarization and its function in the OC microenvironment, we established an in vitro tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) model. THP-1 cells were induced into M0 macrophages with PMA, then polarized to M2 macrophages by adding IL-4 and IL-13. RT-qPCR results showed significantly increased expression of M2 markers CD163 (P< 0.05) and CD206 (P< 0.05) in induced M2 macrophages (Fig.10a), confirming successful polarization.

To explore the effect of the OC microenvironment on macrophage polarization, M0 macrophages were co-cultured with SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. The results showed significant increases in M2 markers CD163 and CD206 compared to M0 macrophages (P< 0.05; Fig.10a), indicating that OC cells can induce M2 polarization, suggesting a role in tumor progression.

To clarify the role of CYBB, we knocked down CYBB and co-cultured it with M0 macrophages. RT-qPCR results revealed that CYBB knockdown significantly reduced M1 markers iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-1 (P< 0.01), while M2 markers CD163 (P< 0.05) and CD206 (P< 0.01) were significantly upregulated (Fig.10b), suggesting that CYBB knockdown may inhibit M1 polarization and promote M2 polarization.

To investigate the relationship between CYBB and ferroptosis in OC macrophages, CYBB was knocked down in OC cell and TAMs. After knockdown, ferroptosis markers ACSL4 and PTGS2 slightly increased, while GPX4, FTH1, and FPS1 showed no significant changes in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 (Fig.10c). However, in TAMs CYBB knockdown significantly increased the expression of ferroptosis markers FTH1 and FSP1 (Fig.10d, e), suggesting that CYBB may influence ferroptosis through macrophage infiltration.

Ferroptosis and TAMs are gaining significant attention in the tumor microenvironment due to their roles in tumor survival and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies suggest that TAMs may regulate iron metabolism by modulating intracellular iron levels, influencing cell death. TAMs typically store iron by binding it to ferritin (Ft). Iron-related gene expression varies with macrophage polarization stages. Compared to M2 macrophages, M1 macrophages exhibit higher expression of Hepcidin and ferritin, and lower expression of ferroportin and Iron Regulatory Proteins 1/2, indicating enhanced iron storage capacity [20]. Iron overload has been shown to increase M1 markers (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) while reducing M2 markers (e.g., transglutaminase 2), suggesting iron overload can induce M1 polarization [21]. Additionally, recent studies indicate that under chronic iron overload, THP-1-derived macrophages tend to exhibit M2-like polarization and downregulate M1 markers [22].

The recent focus in tumor therapy involving macrophages is repolarization, shifting M2-type TAMs to M1-type. Research suggests that Ferroptosis may potentially reverse macrophage repolarization in tumor cells. Studies in tissue samples from lung adenocarcinoma and mouse models have revealed the impact of RRM2 on cancer progression and tumor immune cell infiltration. Inhibiting RRM2 effectively promotes M1 macrophage polarization while suppressing M2 macrophage polarization. Additionally, the Ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 can effectively rebalance RRM2-mediated macrophage polarization [23]. In OC, research suggests that Ferroptosis can enhance OC cell sensitivity to platinum-based drugs, thereby improving chemotherapy efficacy [24]. Ferroptosis has also been found to overcome resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, thereby improving clinical outcomes for OC patients receiving PARP inhibitor therapy [25]. TAMs are not only abundant in the OC microenvironment but also influence patient prognosis. Analysis of a public database comprising over 2000 OC patients found that higher numbers of M0 and M1 macrophages are associated with better prognosis, while increased M2 macrophages are linked to poorer outcomes [26]. It is speculated that Ferroptosis and TAMs synergistically inhibit OC cell growth. Identification of a gene related to Ferroptosis and TAMs could hold therapeutic potential for treating OC.

In our study, we identified CYBB as a potential factor influencing ferroptosis in OC macrophages by bioinformatics analysis. CYBB, a critical component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex, serves as a major source of ROS in vivo [27,28]. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by CYBB are crucial in modulating diverse biological processes, such as immune defense, inflammatory reactions, cell proliferation, and ferroptosis. Research has shown that elevated CYBB expression serves as a dependable prognostic indicator in gastric cancer, correlates with leukemia progression, and affects cell death in non-small cell lung cancer [29–31].Recent research has also revealed that CYBB may be involved in immune infiltration and ferroptosis regulation. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase 2 enhances resistance to viral neuroinflammation by promoting M1 polarization of macrophages in extraneural tissues [32]. Similarly, suppression of CYBB reduces ferroptosis in trophoblasts of preeclampsia patients via the STAT3/GPX4 pathway [33].

Our study found CYBB exhibits significant correlations with diverse immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and B cells, with the strongest correlation observed with macrophages. Analyses from multiple databases and clinical data show differential expression of CYBB in OC tissues, with clear prognostic significance. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CYBB may play a crucial role in OC progression by regulating ferroptosis and macrophage infiltration.

Analysis using the GEPIA2 and TIMER2 databases revealed that CYBB is significantly positively correlated with ferroptosis markers (such as ACSL4, GPX4, FTH1, and PTGS2) and macrophage markers (such as CD80, CD68, CD163, etc.). Experimental validation demonstrated that in OC tissues with high CYBB expression, ferroptosis marker GPX4 and macrophage marker CD68 were also highly expressed. These results suggest that CYBB may influence OC progression by regulating ferroptosis and macrophage polarization.

Through siRNA knockdown experiments, we found that CYBB knockdown significantly inhibited OC cell proliferation and affected Erastin-induced ferroptosis. However, it remains unclear whether this effect is due to CYBB inhibiting sensitivity to Erastin, regulating ferroptosis through hypoxia, or compensatory changes in core ferroptosis molecules such as FTH1. CYBB weakens the Erastin-induced ferroptosis process In temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma [34], but the relationship between CYBB and Erastin in OC requires further experimental validation.

CYBB exhibits dual regulatory effects on macrophage polarization through ROS generation, with polarization outcomes varying across disease contexts. Studies demonstrate that CYBB-derived ROS promotes M1 pro-inflammatory polarization [35,36]. P47phox (a cytoplasmic subunit of the CYBB complex) knockout mice show significantly impaired MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation - a hallmark M1 macrophage feature [36]. However, in Japanese encephalitis, CYBB-generated ROS suppresses M1 polarization, compromising viral control in peripheral tissues and increasing CNS viral load [32].

In RAW 264.7 cells, PPARγ forms a complex with PKCα to inhibit p47phox phosphorylation of CYBB, thereby blocking its activity and impairing phagocytic function [37]. In a sepsis model, macrophage-apoptotic cell contact downregulates SYNCRIP expression, reduces CYBB mRNA stability, decreases ROS production, and consequently promotes M2 polarization [38]. However, whether ROS downregulation similarly induces M2 polarization in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Zhang et al. provided key evidence by developing three distinct TAM mouse models, demonstrating that RAC1 knockout (a crucial component of NOX1 and CYBB/NOX2 complexes) did not affect M1 macrophage differentiation but significantly inhibited M2 differentiation [39]. These findings suggest that inhibiting NOX (where CYBB is a major component)-mediated superoxide (O2⁻) production can block M2 macrophage differentiation. CYBB appears to exert opposing regulatory effects on M1 and M2 macrophage polarization under different conditions.

Our experiments demonstrated that CYBB knock down suppressed the expression of M1 macrophage markers while promoting the upregulation of M2 marker expression. Enrichment analysis implicates CYBB in inflammatory and immune response pathways. As M1 polarization is ROS-dependent, CYBB deletion reduces ROS production and consequently inhibits M1 polarization, consistent with established findings. Notably, the observed upregulation of M2 macrophage markers following CYBB knockout suggests its potential involvement in M2 macrophage polarization in ovarian cancer, although the precise regulatory mechanisms require further investigation.

Finally, we found that in TAMs with CYBB knockout, ferroptosis markers were significantly altered, a change not observed in OC cells, suggesting that macrophage infiltration in OC may influence ferroptosis through CYBB.

In conclusion, CYBB may influence the progression and prognosis of OC by regulating ferroptosis and macrophage polarization. We look forward to more research and clinical applications of CYBB in ovarian cancer.
