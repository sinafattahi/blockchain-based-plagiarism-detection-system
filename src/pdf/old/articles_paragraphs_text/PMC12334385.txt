Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major contributor to cancer mortality and exhibits high intratumoral heterogeneity. The functional role of SPATS2 in LUAD remains poorly defined.

We integrated transcriptomic data from TCGA, GTEx, and GEO databases to evaluate SPATS2 expression patterns and their associations with clinical features and prognosis in LUAD. Genomic analyses were performed to assess copy number variations, mutation correlations, and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Functional enrichment analyses (GSEA, GSVA) and immune infiltration profiling (CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, TIP) were conducted to explore the biological and immunological roles of SPATS2. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the TISCH database (GSE131907) were used to determine SPATS2 expression in tumor microenvironment (TME) cell subsets. In vitro experiments using siRNA-SPATS2 in A549 cells were performed to assess mitochondrial function.

SPATS2 expression was significantly elevated in LUAD tissues and correlated with copy number amplification and increased TMB. High SPATS2 levels were associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, and worse overall survival. Functional analyses revealed enrichment in cell cycle, DNA repair, and metabolic pathways. Immune profiling indicated that SPATS2 modulates immune infiltration, with higher expression linked to increased infiltration of macrophages and Tregs, and reduced stromal and immune scores. Single-cell data showed SPATS2 expression was highest in endothelial and plasma cells. Knockdown of SPATS2 impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced ROS levels in A549 cells.

SPATS2 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in LUAD. Its role in tumor progression, immune remodeling, and mitochondrial function warrants further investigation in personalized therapy development.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) representing the most prevalent histological subtype, accounting for approximately 50% of all lung cancer diagnoses. Despite significant advances in early detection and therapeutic interventions, the five-year overall survival rate for LUAD patients remains suboptimal at approximately 25%, highlighting the urgent need for novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets [1–3]. The emergence of precision medicine and targeted therapies has substantially improved patient outcomes; however, identifying new molecular determinants that drive LUAD progression and therapeutic resistance remains critical for developing more effective treatment strategies.

Spermatogenesis associated serine rich 2 (SPATS2), also known as DNAPTP6, is a serine-rich protein initially characterized for its essential role in male fertility and spermatogenesis. Recent investigations have revealed that SPATS2 functions extend beyond reproductive biology, with emerging evidence suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair mechanisms, and metabolic homeostasis. Environmental factors, particularly endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A, have been shown to modulate SPATS2 expression, indicating its sensitivity to external stimuli [4,5].

Growing evidence implicates SPATS2 in cancer biology across multiple tumor types. In hepatocellular carcinoma, SPATS2 overexpression correlates with enhanced cell proliferation, increased immune cell infiltration, and poor patient prognosis [4–6]. Additionally, SPATS2 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels associate with tumor progression and metastatic potential. These findings suggest that SPATS2 may function as an oncogene in various malignancies; however, its specific role in LUAD pathogenesis and progression remains largely unexplored.

Several critical knowledge gaps exist regarding SPATS2 in LUAD: (1) the expression patterns and clinical significance of SPATS2 in LUAD tissues compared to normal lung tissue remain undefined, (2) the relationship between SPATS2 expression and key clinicopathological features, including survival outcomes, has not been systematically evaluated. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis integrating transcriptomic data from multiple independent datasets (TCGA, GTEx, GEO) [7,8], genomic characterization, functional enrichment analyses, immune microenvironment profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, and in vitro functional validation. Our specific objectives were to: (1) characterize SPATS2 expression patterns in LUAD and evaluate its diagnostic potential, (2) assess the prognostic significance of SPATS2 expression and its independence from established clinical variables. This comprehensive investigation aims to establish SPATS2 as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in LUAD, providing insights for future precision medicine approaches.

This retrospective study integrated multiple independent datasets to comprehensively evaluate SPATS2 expression and function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Primary datasets included: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-LUAD), Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx), Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and Gene Expression Omnibus datasetsGSE31547(n= 50) andGSE40791(n= 194). All datasets were accessed through established protocols with appropriate permissions [9].

To ensure robust cross-dataset comparisons, we implemented systematic batch effect assessment and correction procedures. Raw expression data were log2-transformed and quantile-normalized using the preprocessCore package (v1.58.0). Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were performed to identify potential batch effects. The ComBat algorithm from the sva package (v3.44.0) was applied for batch correction when necessary. Dataset compatibility was statistically validated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visualized through density plots and boxplots.

SPATS2 expression patterns across cancer types were initially surveyed using the TIMER2.0 database (http://timer.cistrome.org/). For TCGA-LUAD analysis, RNA-seq FPKM values were converted to TPM (Transcripts Per Million) for consistency. Differential expression analysis between tumor and normal tissues was performed using the limma package (v3.52.0) with empirical Bayes moderation. For paired sample analysis, paired t-tests were applied. Protein-level validation utilized CPTAC proteomics data accessed through the UALCAN portal. Independent validation datasets (GSE31547,GSE40791) were processed using identical normalization procedures and analyzed using the GEOquery package (v2.64.0).

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using the pROC package (v1.18.0) to assess SPATS2’s discriminatory capacity between tumor and normal tissues. Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using DeLong’s method. Optimal cutoff values were determined using Youden’s J statistic. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated at optimal thresholds.

Survival analyses were conducted using comprehensive methodological approaches to ensure robust cutoff selection [10]. Optimal cutoff values for SPATS2 expression were determined using multiple methods: (1) median expression value, (2) surv_cutpoint function from survminer package (v0.4.9) using maxstat algorithm, (3) X-tile analysis through web-based interface, and (4) time-dependent ROC analysis using timeROC package (v0.4). Final cutoff selection required: minimum group size ≥ 30% of total population, log-rank p-value < 0.05, and validation across multiple datasets.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free interval (DFI), and progression-free interval (PFI) using the survival package (v3.4-0). Statistical significance was assessed using log-rank tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed using the survival package, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals calculated. Model assumptions were validated using Schoenfeld residuals and tested using cox.zph function. Results were visualized using forestplot package (v2.0.1).

Copy number variation (CNV) data were obtained from TCGA using FIREHOSE pipeline (gdac.broadinstitute.org). Gene-level copy number scores were categorized as: −2 (homozygous deletion), −1 (heterozygous deletion), 0 (neutral), + 1 (low-level amplification), + 2 (high-level amplification). The relationship between CNV and gene expression was assessed using Spearman correlation analysis with 95% confidence intervals. Mutation analysis utilized TCGA mutation annotation format (MAF) files processed through maftools package (v2.12.0). Correlations between SPATS2 expression and specific gene mutations were evaluated using permutation tests (n= 10,000 iterations) via the coin package (v1.4-2) independence_test function. Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) was calculated as the total number of somatic mutations per megabase. Correlations between SPATS2 expression and TMB were assessed using Spearman correlation across all TCGA cancer types.

SPATS2 interacting proteins were identified using the Compartmentalized Protein-Protein Interaction (ComPPI) database (http://comppi.linkgroup.hu/) with confidence scores ≥ 0.7 [11,12]. Subcellular localization-specific interactions were prioritized. Network visualization and topological analysis were performed using Cytoscape (v3.9.0) with NetworkAnalyzer plugin.

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using limma (v3.52.0) with empirical Bayes moderation and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction. Genes were ranked by log2 fold change for downstream analyses. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using the fgsea package (v1.22.0) with the following parameters: number of permutations = 10,000, minimum gene set size = 15, maximum gene set size = 500, scoring scheme = weighted, p-value adjustment method = Benjamini-Hochberg. Gene sets were sourced from MSigDB v7.5 including Hallmark (h.all.v7.5), KEGG (c2.cp.kegg.v7.5), and Gene Ontology (c5.go.v7.5) collections. Significantly enriched pathways were defined as|normalized enrichment score (NES)| >1.5 and FDR q-value < 0.05. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) was performed using GSVA package (v1.44.0) with z-score method for metabolic pathway scoring. The relationship between SPATS2 expression and pathway activity scores was assessed using Spearman correlation. Functional state analysis utilized CancerSEA database gene signatures representing 14 distinct cellular states. Correlations between SPATS2 expression and functional state scores were calculated using Spearman correlation with FDR correction.

CIBERSORT Analysis: The CIBERSORT algorithm was applied using the LM22 signature matrix with the following parameters: number of permutations = 1,000, quantile normalization = TRUE, absolute mode = FALSE. Only samples with CIBERSORT p-value < 0.05 were included in downstream analyses. ESTIMATE Analysis: Immune and stromal scores were calculated using ESTIMATE algorithm via estimate package (v1.0.13) based on single-sample GSEA approach. TIP Analysis: Tumor Immune Prediction was performed using TIP web portal (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/TIP/) to assess seven immune-related processes. Correlations between SPATS2 expression and TIP scores were evaluated using Spearman correlation. Statistical comparisons between high and low SPATS2 expression groups were performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with FDR correction for multiple comparisons.

Cell Culture: Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL-185, Manassas, VA, USA) and authenticated by STR profiling were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. siRNA Transfection: Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol [15,16]. SPATS2-targeting siRNA sequences: siRNA-1 (5’-GCAACUGCAAGAAAUUCAUTT-3’), and scrambled control siRNA. Knockdown efficiency was validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.

Three groups were included: (1) Control (untreated), (2) Scrambled siRNA + DMSO, (4) SPATS2 siRNA + TNF-α (10 ng/ml, 24 h). Each experiment included technical triplicates and was repeated independently three times (n= 9 total). Mitochondrial Function Assessment: Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were measured using MitoSOX Red (5 µM, 30 min, 37 °C). Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using JC-1 assay kit following manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence imaging was performed using fluorescence microscopy with consistent exposure parameters. Quantitative analysis was performed on ≥ 100 cells per condition using ImageJ software.

All statistical analyses were performed using R software (v4.2.0). Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test (for normally distributed data) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (for non-normally distributed data) after normality assessment using Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Correlation analyses utilized Spearman’s rank correlation. Multiple testing correction was applied using Benjamini-Hochberg method where appropriate. Statistical significance was defined asp< 0.05. All tests were two-sided unless otherwise specified.

Using the TIMER database, we conducted an analysis of SPATS2 expression in various cancer types such as BLCA (see Fig.1a). Subsequent analysis of the TCGA dataset affirmed the high expression levels of SPATS2 in tumor tissues (see Fig.1b). Moreover, comparison with paired normal samples demonstrated a notable elevation of SPATS2 expression in tumor tissues (see Fig.1c). Integration of TCGA and GTEx data further supported the finding that SPATS2 is upregulated in tumor tissues (see Fig.1d). The ROC curves demonstrated that SPATS2 has a high diagnostic value, with the area under the curve (AUC) indicating its potential as an effective biomarker (Fig.1e). Using the CPTAC database, we assessed SPATS2 expression at the protein level. The results revealed that SPATS2 protein levels are significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, corroborating the gene expression data (Fig.1f). To further validate SPATS2 expression in tumor tissues, we analyzed two independent LUAD cohorts from the GEO database (GSE31547andGSE40791). Consistent with previous findings, SPATS2 was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues in both independent cohorts (Fig.1g and h). In light of these findings, the SPATS2 gene exhibits significantly elevated expression in LUAD, indicating potential utility as a promising biomarker for the disease.

SPATS2 expression exhibited significant elevation in male patients compared to females, implying potential sex-specificity in LUAD (Fig.2a). Moreover, smokers demonstrated markedly higher SPATS2 levels than non-smokers, indicating a correlation between smoking and SPATS2 upregulation (Fig.2b). Additionally, SPATS2 expression was notably elevated in patients with lymph node metastasis, suggesting its involvement in the metastatic process (Fig.2c). Furthermore, SPATS2 expression was significantly higher in advanced LUAD stages compared to early stages, indicating its potential role in disease progression and its utility as a marker for advanced disease (Fig.2d). Finally, elevated SPATS2 expression levels correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) (Fig.2e), disease-specific survival (DSS) (Fig.2f), disease-free interval (DFI) (Fig.2g), and progression-free interval (PFI) (Fig.2h), though not statistically significant with disease-free interval (DFI). Nonetheless, SPATS2 remains a crucial biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes in LUAD patients, particularly OS, DSS, and PFI. Univariate survival analysis indicates that SPATS2 is associated with survival outcomes in LUAD, where it acts as a risk factor (HR > 1) for OS, DSS, DFI, and PFI. Furthermore, multivariate Cox survival analysis suggests that SPATS2 independently influences LUAD prognosis, separate from traditional clinical variables, establishing it as an independent risk factor (Fig.3).

Initially, we explored the association between copy number variation scores and SPATS2 gene expression levels. We observed a consistent rise in SPATS2 expression from homozygous deletion to high copy number amplification (Fig.4a). Additionally, there is a positive correlation between SPATS2 copy number scores and SPATS2 mRNA expression, evidenced by a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.60 (Fig.4b). Furthermore, we investigated whether SPATS2 gene expression correlates with specific gene mutation types. Our analysis in LUAD identified several mutations strongly linked to SPATS2 expression, including CSMD3, SPTA1, and ZFHX4 (Fig.4c). Moreover, we examined the relationship between SPATS2 expression and TMB across all tumors in the TCGA database, revealing a positive correlation specifically in LUAD (Fig.4d). Finally, utilizing the ComPPI database, we identified potential interacting proteins with SPATS2, encompassing RPL10, LRRK2, APP, XPO1, PCM1, PSMC3, SRPK1, HNRNPU, HNRNPL, IFI16, TRIM25, PHAX, CEP43, FAM98A, BORCS6, NRAS, KIF11, DAPK1, TRIM44, ZNRD2, TNFRSF8, and LTBR (Fig.4e).

In an effort to elucidate the underlying functions of SPATS2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we performed a functional gene set enrichment analysis (fgsea). Our findings indicated a notable enrichment of pathways associated with cell cycle regulation in samples with elevated SPATS2 levels, notably those involving the MYC oncogene and the G2/M phase transition pathways, as depicted in Fig.5a. We also detected heightened activity in certain metabolic pathways within the high SPATS2-expressing group, including the folate-mediated one-carbon pool pathway, the biosynthesis of N-glycans, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In contrast, a downregulation was noted in pathways such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and the metabolism of alpha-linolenic acid, as illustrated in Fig.5b. Expanding our analysis, we examined the relationship between SPATS2 expression and a spectrum of 14 cellular functions. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between SPATS2 levels and indices related to cell cycling, DNA integrity disruption, DNA repair mechanisms, cellular invasion, and cell multiplication in LUAD, as shown in Fig.5c. Collectively, these observations imply that SPATS2 could play a role in LUAD by influencing cell cycle progression and metabolic activities, thereby promoting cellular growth, invasiveness, and the transformation into malignancy.

Utilizing the CIBERSORT computational framework, we assessed the presence of 22 distinct immune cell populations within lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues. We employed overlay bar charts to visually contrast the immune cell infiltration patterns between groups characterized by elevated versus reduced SPATS2 expression levels (as shown in Fig.6a). Our CIBERSORT-driven analysis uncovered pronounced disparities in the infiltration of seven specific immune cell types across the high and low SPATS2-expressing cohorts (Fig.6b). Notably, memory B cells, resting dendritic cells, and resting mast cells were more prevalent in the group with diminished SPATS2 expression, while activated CD4 memory T cells, resting natural killer (NK) cells, and M0 macrophages were more common in the group with heightened SPATS2 expression. Further correlational analysis demonstrated robust positive linkages between SPATS2 expression and the infiltration of M0 and M1 macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and resting mast cells (Fig.6c). Additionally, the group with lower SPATS2 expression displayed increased ImmuneScore, StromalScore, and ESTIMATEScore, in contrast to the group with higher SPATS2 expression, which showed a negative association with these scores (Fig.6d). The Tumor Immune Phenome (TIP) score analysis in relation to SPATS2 expression indicated that elevated SPATS2 levels were positively associated with T cell recognition of cancer cells, eosinophil attraction, release of tumor antigens, and basophil recruitment. In contrast, negative associations were found with T cell, Th2 cell, Treg cell, monocyte, and CD4 T cell recruitment, as well as the overall infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment (Fig.6e). Collectively, these findings suggest that SPATS2 may play a transformative role in the tumor immune context by modulating the landscape of immune cell infiltration and potentially suppressing the immune system’s antitumor activities, thus offering fresh perspectives on its immunomodulatory role in LUAD.

We utilized the TISCH database containing the single-cell RNA-seq dataset of LUAD (GSE131907) to investigate the expression of SPATS2 in tumor microenvironment (TME)-related cells. TheGSE131907dataset is divided into 25 clusters, comprising 12 cellular components (Fig.7a and b), CD4Tconv immune cells emerge as the pivotal component of TME in LUAD (Fig.7c). A bar graph depicts the proportions of different cellular components in each sample (Fig.7d). There are significant changes in the expression level of SPATS2 in different cell types, with the highest expression in endothelial cells and plasma cells (Fig.7e and f). This study revealed the expression pattern of SPATS2 in the tumor microenvironment of LUAD, highlighting the importance of CD4T cells and the potential involvement of endothelial and plasma cells.

JC-1 staining showed the highest mitochondrial membrane potential in the control group (aggregates/monomers ratio ~ 0.9), significantly decreased potential after TNF-α treatment (ratio ~ 0.4), and partial recovery of potential in the TNF-α + siRNA-SPATS2 group (ratio ~ 0.6), indicating that SPATS2 knockdown alleviated TNF-α-induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss (Fig.8A and J). MitoSOX staining revealed the lowest mitochondrial ROS levels in the control group (~ 50), significantly elevated ROS in the TNF-α group (~ 250), and intermediate ROS levels in the TNF-α + siRNA-SPATS2 group (~ 130), suggesting that SPATS2 knockdown partially alleviated TNF-α-induced oxidative stress(Fig.8K and N).

This comprehensive multi-omics investigation provides the first systematic characterization of SPATS2 in LUAD, revealing its potential as both a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Our findings demonstrate significant SPATS2 overexpression in LUAD across multiple independent datasets, establish its prognostic significance, and elucidate its complex roles in tumor progression and immune microenvironment remodeling.

Our analysis confirmed consistent SPATS2 upregulation in LUAD tissues compared to normal lung tissue across TCGA, GTEx, and independent GEO datasets [17,18], with robust validation at the protein level using CPTAC data. The diagnostic performance of SPATS2 (AUC = 0.873) demonstrates substantial discriminatory capacity, approaching the performance of established lung cancer biomarkers [19,20]. However, when compared to current clinical diagnostic approaches, SPATS2 alone shows limitations. While promising, its diagnostic utility would likely require integration with existing biomarker panels rather than standalone application. The reproducibility of SPATS2 overexpression across diverse cohorts strengthens confidence in its biological significance, though technical validation in clinical specimens using standardized assays remains necessary for clinical implementation.

High SPATS2 expression consistently associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals. The independence of SPATS2 prognostic value from traditional clinical variables (TNM staging, age, gender) in multivariate analysis suggests its potential utility for enhanced risk stratification. However, the prognostic performance of SPATS2 requires contextualization within existing prognostic models [21,22]. While our findings are encouraging, established molecular markers such as EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression remain more clinically relevant for treatment selection. Future studies should evaluate whether SPATS2 adds meaningful prognostic information to comprehensive clinical-molecular models rather than examining it in isolation.

The strong correlation between SPATS2 copy number amplification and expression levels (r= 0.60) suggests that genomic alterations contribute significantly to SPATS2 dysregulation in LUAD. The positive association with tumor mutation burden indicates that SPATS2 may be linked to genomic instability, potentially through its emerging roles in DNA repair processes. Our protein interaction network analysis revealed connections with key cancer-related proteins, including cell cycle regulators and DNA repair machinery, consistent with functional enrichment analyses showing activation of proliferative and DNA damage response pathways.

The enrichment of cell cycle progression, MYC signaling, and G2/M checkpoint pathways in high SPATS2-expressing tumors aligns with its established role in cellular proliferation [23–25]. Conversely, the downregulation of differentiation and apoptotic pathways suggests that SPATS2 may promote dedifferentiation and survival advantages in cancer cells. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how SPATS2 might drive tumor progression, though experimental validation of these pathway associations remains necessary.

Our immune microenvironment analysis revealed complex and sometimes contradictory associations that warrant careful interpretation. CIBERSORT analysis indicated positive correlations between SPATS2 expression and regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration, while TIP analysis suggested negative associations. This discrepancy likely reflects fundamental differences in computational methodologies: CIBERSORT employs deconvolution algorithms on bulk RNA-seq data with specific immune cell signatures, while TIP utilizes different gene expression patterns and scoring systems. Such methodological differences can yield conflicting results, particularly for cell types with overlapping gene expression profiles.

The observed association between high SPATS2 expression and increased M0 macrophage infiltration, combined with reduced immune and stromal scores, suggests a potential immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, these correlative findings require experimental validation through functional studies and cannot establish causality. The biological significance of these immune associations remains unclear and may reflect indirect effects rather than direct SPATS2-mediated immune modulation.

Our single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed important insights that require careful interpretation. SPATS2 expression was highest in endothelial cells and plasma cells within the tumor microenvironment, rather than in cancer cells themselves. This finding challenges simple assumptions about SPATS2’s role as a cancer cell-intrinsic oncogene and suggests more complex microenvironmental interactions.

The predominant expression in endothelial cells may indicate roles in tumor angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, while expression in plasma cells could reflect immune system engagement. These findings suggest that SPATS2’s effects on LUAD progression may be mediated through microenvironmental changes rather than direct cancer cell transformation. However, the functional consequences of SPATS2 expression in these specific cell types remain unexplored and represent important areas for future investigation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that SPATS2 knockdown affects mitochondrial function in A549 cells, providing initial functional validation. However, the experimental design and interpretation have limitations. The apparent contradiction in our results where SPATS2 knockdown both impairs mitochondrial function and reverses TNF-α-induced damage requires clarification through additional controlled experiments with appropriate rescue studies.

The mitochondrial effects suggest potential roles in cellular energetics and oxidative stress responses, which could connect to SPATS2’s broader effects on cell survival and proliferation. However, these preliminary findings require extensive validation through dose-response studies, time-course analyses, and mechanistic investigations to establish causality and clinical relevance.

This study has several important limitations that influence interpretation and clinical applicability. The retrospective design limits our ability to establish causality and may introduce selection biases. The reliance on computational analyses of existing datasets, while comprehensive, cannot substitute for prospective validation in well-defined clinical cohorts.The contradictory immune analysis results highlight the limitations of computational immune cell infiltration methods and emphasize the need for experimental validation through techniques such as multiplex immunofluorescence or flow cytometry. Our single-cell analysis, while informative, was limited to a single dataset and requires validation across diverse patient populations.The functional experiments, though promising, were limited in scope and require expansion to include comprehensive mechanistic studies, dose-response relationships, and rescue experiments. The lack of in vivo validation represents a significant gap that must be addressed to understand SPATS2’s roles in tumor progression.

Future investigations should prioritize: (1) prospective clinical validation in diverse patient cohorts, (2) experimental elucidation of SPATS2’s functional roles in different cell types, (3) mechanistic studies connecting genomic alterations to functional consequences, (4) evaluation of SPATS2 as a therapeutic target through targeted intervention studies, and (5) integration of SPATS2 with existing clinical-molecular models for enhanced prognostic accuracy.

This comprehensive analysis establishes SPATS2 as a consistently overexpressed gene in LUAD with potential prognostic significance. While our findings provide important insights into SPATS2’s associations with clinical outcomes and molecular pathways, the path to clinical translation requires substantial additional validation.
