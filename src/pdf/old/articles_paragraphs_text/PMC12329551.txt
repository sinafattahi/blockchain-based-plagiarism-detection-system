Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is considered the best treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This procedure offers effective symptom relief across varying prostate sizes.

This study aimed to evaluate preoperative and postoperative outcomes of HoLEP in patients with different prostate volumes in a multicenter comparative analysis conducted in Jordan.

A cohort study was conducted in 3 private clinics in Amman, Jordan. It included 77 patients who were divided into 2 groups according to prostate volume: smaller than or equal to 40 ml (n = 37) and larger than 40 ml (n = 40). The data collected preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively included urinary symptoms, quality of life (QoL) scores, and functional parameters. Statistical analyses included pairedttests and independentttests.

Both groups exhibited improvements in relation to initial values, as assessed after the procedure using the International Prostate Symptom Score (≤40 ml, 16 vs 7.6; >40 ml, 14.9 vs 4.6;P<⁠0.001). Their QoL scores also improved (≤40 ml, 3.2 vs 1.5; >40 ml, 3 vs 1.3;P<⁠0.001). The maximum urinary flow rate increased in both groups (≤40 ml, 8.2 ml/s vs 14 ml/s; >40 ml, 8.6 ml/s vs 13.6 ml/s;P<⁠0.001), with similar improvements in postvoid residual urine volume. Larger prostates required longer enucleation times (≤40 ml, 19.8 min; >40 ml, 39.3 min;P= 0.04) with more tissue removal (≤40 ml, 4.7 g; >40 ml, 17 g;P<⁠0.001).

HoLEP effectively improved various measured parameters, including urinary symptoms, QoL, and functional outcomes in patients with BPH across all prostate sizes. Larger prostates required procedures of increased complexity.

Nonsurgical interventions, such as the UroLift system (Teleflex Interventional Urology, Pleasanton, California, United States), are not suitable for all patients. Notably, treating patients with obstructions or larger prostates poses great challenges. In such cases, pharmacological treatments, such as α-blockers and 5-α reductase inhibitors, are used, but they often fail to provide complete symptom relief and may trigger various adverse effects, such as dizziness, hypotension, and sexual dysfunction. These issues can lead to poor adherence.4,5Additionally, balancing symptom relief with the preservation of sexual function remains a challenge.1,5This may lead to an increased demand for treatments that combine effectiveness with minimal invasiveness and quick recovery.

Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is a minimally invasive procedure, recognized for its adaptability across all prostate sizes. In fact, some patients benefit from it, regardless of volume considerations.1,3,6While the laser helps remove blocking tissues via morcellation, some reports1,7emphasize HoLEP’s reduced complication profile, as compared with open prostatectomy or TURP. It carries a lower risk of bleeding and reoperation.

Still, large prostate volumes introduce certain complexities. Studies suggest that larger sizes might translate into longer enucleation times, and possibly more tissue to remove.11,12It can affect patients’ preoperative preparation and even influence the planning of the procedure.

Studies indicate that HoLEP brings substantial symptom relief for patients with a larger prostate.13,14This improves patient expectation management, allowing for a better understanding of volume-related outcomes, which can guide future innovations and refinements in BPH treatment.13,15,16However, the limited availability of comprehensive data makes it challenging to implement evidence-based national guidelines.

The study aimed to evaluate preoperative and postoperative characteristics and outcomes of HoLEP patients with different prostate volumes.

A comparative cohort study design was used to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of HoLEP in patients with different prostate volumes. The study was conducted in 3 hospitals in Amman, Jordan, between January 2022 and December 2024.

The study included 77 patients. Inclusion criteria comprised men diagnosed with BPH, aged 40 years or more, who underwent HoLEP. Exclusion criteria were previous prostate surgeries, active urinary tract infections, or significant comorbidities affecting surgical risk or outcomes.FIGURE 1outlines the selection process. Out of 108 patients initially screened, 31 did not meet the inclusion criteria. The final sample consisted of 77 patients, who were then classified into 2 groups based on prostate volume: 37 patients with volume smaller than or equal to 40 ml (group 1) and 40 patients with volume greater than 40 ml (group 2).

All patients underwent HoLEP performed by experienced urologists using standardized surgical protocols. The procedure involved laser enucleation of obstructive prostate tissue, followed by morcellation for tissue removal. Preoperative and postoperative care was standardized for all patients.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of HoLEP in improving urinary symptoms, functional voiding parameters, and patient-reported QoL. All primary outcomes were measured preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively.

Secondary outcomes were measured to assess intraoperative and perioperative surgical efficiency and safety. These included changes in hemoglobin (Hb) levels, enucleation time, and the weight of enucleated tissue. Difference in Hb levels (g/l) before and after surgery served as an indicator of blood loss. Enucleation time, defined as the time from the initial laser incision to the completion of enucleation, was measured to reflect procedural complexity.1Total weight of the enucleated prostate tissue was recorded after morcellation, and the enucleated tissue ratio was calculated by dividing the enucleated tissue weight by the preoperative prostate volume and multiplying it by 100, to evaluate the completeness and efficiency of tissue removal.14,21All data were consistently collected across the 3 participating centers using standardized protocols and instruments.TABLE 1presents the study variables and their definitions.

Patients were assigned into 2 groups based on prostate volume. Group 1 included participants with prostate volume smaller than or equal to 40 ml, and group 2 comprised patients with prostate volume greater than 40 ml. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics package version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Prior to the analysis, all continuous variables were evaluated for normality using a visual assessment of histograms and quantile-quantile plots, and were found to follow an approximately normal distribution. The clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were evaluated using thettest for continuous variables (2-tailed tests). The data were reported as mean (SD). Within each group, changes in continuous variables were analyzed using paired (2-tailed)ttests to compare preoperative and postoperative results at follow-up after 3 months. Independentttests were used to assess differences in changes between the groups. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with aPvalue below 0.05 deemed significant.

The study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of Mutah University (21025). Data were anonymized to protect patient privacy.

InTABLE 2, we compare preoperative characteristics between the 2 groups based on prostate volume (≤40 ml [n = 37] vs >40 ml [n = 40]). Both groups were similar in the majority of preoperative characteristics. Other variables, including age (54.9 vs 54.9 years), total IPSS score (16 vs 14.9), flow rates (8.2 vs 8.6 ml/s), prostate-specific antigen levels (1.3 vs 2.5 µg/l), body mass index (21.2 vs 20.3 kg/m²), and Hb levels (123 vs 117 g/l) were similar between the groups.

TABLE 3illustrates improvements in key urinary parameters after HoLEP in group 1. Hb levels decreased slightly from mean (SD) 123 (9) to 121 (12) g/l (P= 0.07), indicating minimal impact of the procedure on Hb. The IPSS QoL score improved markedly from 3.2 (1.1) to 1.5 (0.7;P<⁠0.001), and toal IPSS score decreased considerably from 16 (7.2) to 7.6 (4.6;P<⁠0.001).

The voiding subscore improved substantially, dropping from 10.5 (5.1) to 3.2 (2.9;P<⁠0.001), while the storage subscore showed a modest decrease from 5.7 (3.5) to 4.2 (2.2;P= 0.06). Additionally, postvoid PVR decreased markedly from 47.6 (58.7) to 17 (18.4) ml (P= 0.03). Qmaxincreased considerably from 8.2 (3.6) to 14 (6.6) ml/s (P<⁠0.001).

TABLE 4highlights improvements in urinary parameters after HoLEP in group 2. Hb levels showed a notable reduction from mean (SD) 117 (9) to 106 (12) g/l (P<⁠0.001), reflecting a significant impact of the procedure on hemoglobin. The IPSS QoL score improved markedly from 3 (1.2) to 1.3 (1;P<⁠0.001), while total IPSS score decreased substantially from 14.9 (6.6) to 4.6 (3.3;P<⁠0.001).

The voiding subscore showed a remarkable reduction from 88.8 (4.5) to 1.3 (1.7;P<⁠0.001), and the storage subscore also decreased notably from 6.1 (3.2) to 3.3 (2.4;P<⁠0.001). Furthermore, PVR decreased from 47.8 (58.2) to 21.3 (28.4) ml (P<⁠0.001), indicating improved bladder emptying. Qmaxincreased considerably from 8.6 (4.3) to 13.6 (7.3) ml/s (P<⁠0.001), reflecting enhanced urinary flow.

TABLE 5outlines HoLEP outcomes in both groups. There was no notable difference in Hb reduction between group 1 (mean [SD], 1.1 [1] g/dl) and group 2 (mean [SD], 0.7 [0.9] g/dl;P= 0.2). Both groups showed improvements in IPSS scores. Group 2 patients had slightly higer total IPSS score (mean [SD], 10.2 [6.8] vs 8.3 [6.6]) and storage subscores (mean [SD], 2.9 [3.5] vs 1.5 [3.1]), but these differences were insignificant. QoL improvements were similar in both groups (mean [SD], 1.7 [1.3] vs 1.7 [1.2];P= 0.88).

Reduction in PVR was comparable (mean [SD], 30.6 [62.5] ml for prostate volume ≤40 ml vs 26.4 [55.1] ml for prostate volume >40 ml;P= 0.88). Improvement in Qmaxwas also similar (mean [SD], 6.2 [7.6] vs 7.4 [8.1] ml/s;P= 0.54). Group 2 patients required significantly longer enucleation times than those assigned to group 1 (mean [SD], 39.3 [30.8] vs 19.8 [12.5] min;P= 0.04), and they also had more tissue removed (mean [SD], 17 [13.7] vs 4.7 [3.7] g;P<⁠0.001). The enucleated tissue ratio was markedly higher in group 2 patients (mean [SD], 26.3% [14.4%] vs 18.5% [13.9%];P= 0.04).

HoLEP has emerged as a gold standard treatment for BPH, offering effective symptom relief across various prostate sizes. This study aimed to evaluate preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes in patients with prostate volume smaller than or equal to 40 ml and larger than 40 ml. The results showed that HoLEP significantly improved urinary symptoms, QoL, and functional parameters, regardless of the prostate size. The patients had better Qmaxand PVR values, and their IPSS scores dropped considerably following the procedure. However, they were assessed over a 3-month follow-up period, which is relatively short and does not provide insights into the likelihood of future recurrence or complications.

Li et al23explored a combination of thulium laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuLEP) and thulium fiber laser (TFL) for BPH cases complicated by bladder stones. They reported shorter surgery times, less pronounced Hb level decrease, and fewer catheterization days. QoL and IPSS scores improved, too. Compared with standard TURP with bladder lithotomy, this combination seemed to work better in those cases. They reported an impressive stone clearance rate of 100%.

Taking the above into account, we can conclude that HoLEP is highly effective, while ThuLEP combined with TFL is extraordinarily efficacious when bladder stones are involved. However, longer follow-up is needed, particularly in countries with fewer resources, such as Jordan, where these technologies could make a real difference.

Our study has certain limitations. Without extended follow-up, it is difficult to assess sustainability of the results and occurrence of potential complications. Also, the sample was quite small and all participants came from the same area, which precludes generalizability of the findings. Expanding the sample to other regions of Jordan or even beyond its borders would be advisable. Future work might also focus on other surgical approaches in order to draw long-term conclusions.

The findings reaffirm the status of HoLEP as the gold standard for BPH treatment, as it offers durable symptom relief and excellent functional outcomes. Regardless of the prostatic volume, the patients exhibited significant improvements in urinary symptoms, QoL, and functional parameters.
