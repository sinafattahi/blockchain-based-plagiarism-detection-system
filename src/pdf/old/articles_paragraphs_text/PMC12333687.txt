Cell cycle regulation is pivotal for tissue regeneration yet remains challenging in degenerative microenvironments. We engineered a sonosensitive conductive hydrogel incorporating polypyrrole-encapsulated porphyrin derivatives {[Tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP)]@PPy} to regulate cell cycle dynamics. Upon ultrasound irradiation, TCPP@PPy generates free electrons, establishing a controlled microcurrent within degenerative tissues. This sonoelectric niche induces nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) membrane depolarization, activating calcium voltage-gated channels (Cav) to drive Ca2+influx. Subsequent calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I activation up-regulates cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/CDK2, forming a sonoelectricity–ion–kinase axis that stimulates NPC proliferation and anabolism. Concurrently, ultrasound-responsive borate ester bonds in the hydrogel amplify reactive oxygen species scavenging, counteracting oxidative stress–induced NPC ferroptosis. In a goat model of intervertebral disc degeneration, ultrasound-guided hydrogel implantation alleviated degenerative progression by synergistically reactivating cell cycle progression and suppressing oxidative damage. This strategy demonstrates a noninvasive, dual-targeted approach to regulate degenerative microenvironments through spatiotemporal control of sonoelectric and biochemical cues, offering a translatable strategy for tissue regeneration therapies.

A sonosensitive conductive hydrogel revives cell cycle and blocks oxidation damage to reverse intervertebral disc degeneration.

During the pathological process of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IVDD), avascular nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue at the center is subjected to persistent abnormal biomechanical loading, which leads to inflammation and catabolism of NP cells (NPCs), ultimately resulting in irreversible degenerative changes in the NP tissue (1,2). Given the deep anatomical location of IVDs, current surgical interventions remain inherently invasive (3). While regenerative strategies—including biomaterial-based approaches, stem cell therapies, gene modulation, and tissue engineering—have predominantly focused on IVD repair, they fail to induce durable cellular proliferation or functional extracellular matrix (ECM) restoration (4). Developing noninvasive strategies to controllably activate endogenous cells proliferation and rebalance ECM homeostasis thus represents a pivotal frontier in overcoming pathological IVDD.

The cell cycle is a fundamental biological process that orchestrates DNA replication, cell growth, and cell division, precisely regulating tissue homeostasis and regeneration (5,6). Aberrations in cell cycle control can lead to unchecked cell proliferation, contributing to cancer (7), while dysregulation of the cell cycle underlies multiple degenerative disorders. For instance, G2-M phase arrest in renal tubular epithelial cells promotes renal fibrosis (8), and synergistic interplay between cell cycle dysregulation and oxidative stress drives neurodegeneration (9). Emerging evidence indicate that persistent cell cycle arrest initiates a cascade of molecular events culminating in cellular senescence (10), a biological process recognized as a key contributor to IVDD (11). The intricate signaling networks regulate the cell cycle, and their integration with pathways orchestrates cellular differentiation and tissue regeneration (6). Interfering in these mechanisms may increase the regenerative potential of cells and promote the development of therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine (12). Therefore, targeted modulation of cell cycle dynamics through specific molecular pathways thus emerges as a theoretically plausible therapeutic method for IVDD.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) form heterodimers with cyclins. In this complex, CDKs act as catalytic subunits, and cyclins acts as regulatory subunits that catalyze the phosphorylation of various substrates, thereby driving the progression through different cell cycle phases and ensuring that cell division is under stringent control (13,14). In particular, CDK2 is relevant for DNA replication and promotes the transition from the G1phase to the S phase, and CDK1 has emerged as the dominant determinant of the G2-M phase (13,15). Typically, CDKs become completely active only after being phosphorylated, combining substrate phosphorylation patterns regulated by the cyclin-CDK complex, orderly coordinating the transition through S phase and mitosis (14,16,17). Studies have revealed that CDK1 and CDK4 overexpression effectively promote cardiomyocyte division (12). CDKs activation also induces the expansion of splenic T cell subsets, enhancing immune regulation (18). These findings imply that activating CDKs to advance the cell cycle may be a potential therapeutic approach for treating degenerative diseases. However, a strategy aimed at repairing IVDD by activating the CDKs of NPCs to regulate the cell cycle has not yet been reported.

CDKs are activated by various upstream factors, including phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinases; degradation of CDK inhibitors, which release CDK activity; and regulation by mitogen-activated protein kinases (18–20). In recent years, CDKs have also been shown to be activated by calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) (21,22), a class of protein kinases activated by calcium ions (Ca2+) and calmodulin that mediate calcium signal transduction through the phosphorylation of substrate proteins and play crucial roles in regulating various cellular functions (23,24). Studies have reported that calcium voltage-gated channel (Cav) opening results in Ca2+influx, which subsequently activates CaMKs (23–26). Electrical currents can induce cell membrane depolarization, triggering Cavopening (25,27). However, the efficacy of electrical signal–based strategies for tissue regeneration remains unstable and lacks defined molecular targets (28,29). Moreover, lumbar percutaneous electrical currents (30,31) cannot accurately target deeply located IVDs. Therefore, we are seeking a noninvasive and precise local electrical stimulation strategy to regulate the cell cycle for IVDD therapy.

Tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) exhibits high molecular photothermal conversion efficiency and exceptional sonosensitivity, complemented by its superior aqueous solubility and biocompatibility, which facilitate homogeneous tissue distribution in vivo and minimize potential side effects (32,33). In this study, we synthesized a sonosensitive particle by encapsulating a porphyrin derivative with polypyrrole (TCPP@PPy). PPy, a highly biocompatible and conductive polymer (34), was then polymerized with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a composite (PPy/PVA). By mixing PPy/PVA, TCPP@PPy, and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)–sensitive cross-linker [N1-(4-boronobenzyl)-N3-(4-boronophenyl)-N1,N1,N3,N3-tetramethylpropane-1,3-diaminium (TSPBA)] (35), a sonosensitive and conductive hydrogel (TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA) was prepared via in situ gelling. We found that the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogel can generate an ultrasonic current under ultrasound (US) irradiation; this alters the membrane potential of the NPCs and promotes Cavopening on the NPC membrane. The influx of Ca2+activates CaMK1, which further activates CDK1 and CDK2. This cascade promotes the cell cycle, thereby facilitating the regeneration of NPCs. This ROS-degradable hydrogel subsequently accelerated ROS clearance under US conditions, thereby mitigating NPC ferroptosis. Last, we delivered the hydrogel to degenerated IVDs in goats via puncture and subsequently treated them with US. After customized US treatment, IVDD in goats was successfully treated, demonstrating the clinical translational potential of this noninvasive strategy (Fig. 1A).

TCPP@PPy particles were prepared via a modified chemical oxidation polymerization method (36). The long PPy chains enwind TCPP and are interconnected with them via hydrogen bonds or π–π interactions (Fig. 1B). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that the PPy and TCPP@PPy particles are relatively uniform spheres (Fig. 1C). Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping revealed the uniform distribution of C, N, and O elements in the PPy and TCPP@PPy particles (fig. S1A). Dynamic light scattering analysis revealed that the peak diameters in the intensity distribution of PPy and TCPP@PPy particles were approximately 255 ± 80.96 and 396 nm, respectively (Fig. 1D). The polydispersity index (PDI) of PPy particles (0.227) is consistent with previously reported values (37). In contrast, the higher PDI of TCPP@PPy particles (0.353), indicative of moderate dispersity and comparable to that of various biomedical polymer particles (38), suggests that surface functionalization may introduce slight heterogeneity (fig. S1B). The zeta potential of PPy (−7.60 ± 11.5 mV) and TCPP@PPy (49.0 ± 19.8 mV) indicate the introduction of cationic groups during TCPP@PPy synthesis, suggesting the possible existence of charge-interaction binding modes in the TCPP@PPy composite (fig. S1, B to D). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of PPy, TCPP, and TCPP@PPy depicted various characteristic bands (fig. S1E) (39–41). The peaks observed in the PPy FTIR spectra at 3445, 1635, and 1400 cm−1correspond to the N─H, C─C, and conjugated C─N stretching vibrations, respectively. The peak at 1050 cm−1represents C─H in-plane deformation vibration. The peaks at 1115 and 932 cm−1indicate the PPy doping state. The peaks at 1400, 1228, and 1173 cm−1in the TCPP FTIR spectrum represent C─O─H in-plane bending, C─O stretching, and C─N stretching vibrations, respectively. The peak at 1664 cm−1is the stretching vibration of C═O in the carboxylic group. The peak at 1604 cm−1corresponds to the stretching vibration of aromatic C═C. Various peaks ranging from 1564 to 1472 cm−1are attributed to the stretching modes of the porphyrin ring, specifically C═C, Cα─Cβ, Cβ─Cβ, Cα─Cm(m: meso carbon), and C═N bonds. The peak at 793 cm−1is attributed to the C─H out-of-plane bending vibration of the phenyl ring, indicating p-substitution. The characteristic peaks of PPy and TCPP are observed in the TCPP@PPy FTIR spectrum, implying their successful synthesis. Compared with that of TCPP, the intensity of the C═O peak shifted from 1664 to 1677 cm−1, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds with the attached carboxyl groups. At 1604 cm−1, the C═C aromatic stretching vibration in TCPP@PPy is weaker than that in TCPP, which may be attributed to π–π interactions between the TCPP phenyl rings and the pyrrole rings. Particles incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were analyzed by FTIR at multiple time points. The spectra revealed retention of TCPP@PPy’s characteristic absorption bands throughout the 42-day observation period, confirming no significant chemical degradation occurred under physiological conditions (fig. S1F). The morphology stability of TCPP@PPy particles in PBS was investigated using TEM. On day 0, the particles exhibited a relatively well-defined spherical morphology. From days 14 to 28, the particles gradually formed irregular aggregates. By day 42, the edges became blurred, and the aggregated structures became more pronounced (fig. S1G). Overall, the particles demonstrated relatively good stability throughout the observation period.

The final hydrogel network was formed by mixing 1 mg of TCPP@PPy with 1 ml of oxidatively polymerized PPy/PVA composite, followed by cross-linking with TSPBA (Fig. 1E). PVA, PPy/PVA, TCPP mixed with PPy/PVA (TCPP-PPy/PVA), and TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA were cross-linked with TSPBA for comparative analysis (Fig. 1F). SEM revealed that all of the hydrogel networks exhibited porous structures (Fig. 1G). The peaks in the FTIR spectrum of the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel cover the major peaks of the other intermediate gels, indicating the integrity of its composition and structure (Fig. 1H, gray box). Given that 9% (w/v) PVA in hydrogels has optimal flexibility (42), we adjusted the content of PPy and found that when the concentration of PPy within the PPy/PVA framework reached 0.1 M, the compressive stress of the gel no longer substantially increased (Fig. 1I). Simultaneously, as the concentration of PPy in the gel increases, the stiffness of the gel rises, while its ductility decreases (fig. S2A). We further investigate influence of different concentration particles on the biomechanical properties of hydrogels. Beyond TCPP@PPy (0.1 mg/ml) loading, compressive strength plateaued (fig. S2B), while ductility exhibited progressive deterioration with increasing particle content (fig. S2C). In addition, compared with the PVA gel, the synthesized final gel exhibited slightly reduced swelling properties. After 240 s, the aqueous absorption of the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel did not increase substantially, indicating that the hydrogel network has both absorbency and stability (Fig. 1J). The ROS-responsive gel can be continuously degraded in a H2O2environment (20 mM). The degradation assay revealed that the samples degraded slowly in PBS. Under H2O2conditions, the PVA gel completely degraded on day 7, whereas the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel fully degraded on day 10. This finding suggested that the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel with a higher degree of cross-linking has a longer duration (Fig. 1K).

We hypothesized that sonosensitive TCPP@PPy can generate free electrons to generate a current under US induction. With 0.1 M PPy, we used an electrochemical workstation to measure the ultrasonic current generated by TCPP@PPy under US irradiation at different TCPP concentrations. When the concentration of TCPP increased to 1 mM, the intensity of the ultrasonic current did not substantially increase, indicating that 1 mM is an optimal concentration (Fig. 2A). Electrochemistry measurements were also performed on particles after storage in PBS for 14, 28, and 42 days. Although the ultrasonic current intensity of TCPP@PPy showed a slight decrease by day 42, it remained substantial under US stimulation, confirming the stability of its ultrasonic response (fig. S3A). To further investigate the underlying mechanisms, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained. The results showed that the PL intensity of TCPP@PPy was markedly lower than that of TCPP, indicating that the excited electrons in TCPP@PPy were easier to transfer. These free electrons generated from TCPP are potentially captured by PPy, thereby increasing the current intensity (Fig. 2B). Similarly, after immersion in PBS, the particles exhibited a slight increase in PL peak intensity over time. Even at day 42, the peak remained substantial different from that of TCPP, demonstrating the stability of the particles’ ultrasonic excitation–induced electron migration capability (fig. S3B). As shown inFig. 2C, TCPP@PPy exhibited greater absorption than did TCPP according to ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The corresponding Kubelka-Munk plots revealed that the bandgaps of TCPP and TCPP@PPy were estimated as 1.64 and 1.28 eV, respectively, indicating that PPy decreased the energy barrier of TCPP (Fig. 2D). Collectively, under US induction, the electrons in the TCPP@PPy particles are more easily excited from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), overcoming the bandgap to transition into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (43). In addition, the conductive PPy also acted as an electron trap to improve the transfer of free electrons (Fig. 2E). UV-vis spectra of hydrogels were also measured, demonstrating that the conductive hydrogel–encapsulated sonosensitive core approach (TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA) exhibited the strongest visible-light absorption with the smallest bandgap (Fig. 2F). Bandgaps of PVA, PPy/PVA, TCPP/PPy/PVA, and TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogels were calculated from the corresponding Kubelka-Munk plots as 2.36, 2.52, 3.67, and 4.01 eV, respectively (Fig. 2G).

We hypothesized that the generated ultrasonic current can be conducted within the conductive hydrogel. Under the condition of 9% (w/v) PVA, electrical conductivity tests demonstrated that the gel was conductive. Furthermore, when the PPy concentration was increased to 0.1 M, the gel conductivity did not substantially improve, indicating that 0.1 M is the optimal concentration for application (Fig. 2H). Similarly, the synthesized PPy/PVA, TCPP/PPy/PVA, and TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogels exhibited markedly higher conductivities than did PVA, with no notable differences noted among them (Fig. 2I). The PL spectra revealed that the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel is more easily excited to generate free electrons than the other gels are (Fig. 2J). In addition,Fig. 2Kshows that TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA produced the strongest ultrasonic current under US irradiation. In particular, the sonosensitivity of the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel is superior to that of the gel formed by directly mixing TCPP with PPy/PVA (TCPP/PPy/PVA), highlighting the necessity of introducing sonosensitive TCPP@PPy particles. In brief, under US induction, the sonosensitive gel is excited to generate free electrons from many independent sonosensitive units, resulting in an improved electric current conducted through the gel. This hydrogel can convert ultrasonic energy into electrical energy, and the sonoelectric niche may affect the cells or tissues it contacts.

The biocompatibility of the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel was first evaluated using three-dimensional (3D) cultures of NPCs at a concentration of 2.5 × 106cells/ml (44). Live/dead staining showed that the cells maintained good viability on the 7th day, indicating that the gel is relatively biocompatible (Fig. 3A). NPCs (1 × 106, 2.5 × 106, 5 × 106, and 7.5 × 106cells/ml) encapsulated in this hydrogel demonstrated sustained viability after 7 days of 3D culture, as evidenced by predominant green fluorescence signals across all concentration groups, highlighting the hydrogel’s concentration-independent cytoprotective effects within a certain range under 3D culture conditions (fig. S4A). Subsequently, we treated NPCs with US alone of different intensity. It was observed that cell viability markedly decreased when the US intensity exceeded 0.5 W/cm2. To ensure cell viability while maximizing the generation of ultrasonic current, an US intensity of 0.3 W/cm2was found to be suitable (Fig. 3B).

(A) The TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel’s impact on NPC viability within a 3D culture system was evaluated through live/dead fluorescence staining on days 1, 3, and 7. (B) The MTT assay was used to determine the impact of varying US intensity on cell viability, with the culture time plotted as a line graph. Data shown are means ± SD ofn= 3 biological replicates. (C) NPCs from Control, TBHP, TBHP + US, TBHP + Gel, and TBHP + Gel + US groups were performed live/dead and phalloidin fluorescence staining. (D) The PCR assay results from the Control-, TBHP-, TBHP + US–, TBHP + Gel–, and TBHP + Gel + US–treated NPCs were normalized and subsequently displayed using a heatmap. Data shown are means ± SD ofn= 3 biological replicates. (E) WB analysis of inflammatory factor expression in NPCs following treatment with Control, TBHP, TBHP + US, TBHP + Gel, and TBHP + Gel + US experimental conditions. (F) The WB assay band images of ECM metabolism–related protein in NPCs following treatment with Control, TBHP, TBHP + US, TBHP + Gel, and TBHP + Gel + US. (G) Control-, TBHP-, TBHP + US–, TBHP + Gel–, and TBHP + Gel + US–treated NPCs were stained by Alcian. The darker the blue staining represents the better the catabolism of proteoglycan in NPCs.

To investigate the effects of gels on degenerative NPCs induced withtert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), we subjected NPCs to 3D culture using both TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA and PVA gels. Notably, only the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel noticeably restored the fluorescence intensity of both the live/dead staining and COL2A1 immunofluorescence following US treatment (0.3 W/cm2) compared with the fluorescence intensity induced by TBHP-mediated inflammation (fig. S4B). Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot (WB) revealed that the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel, in contrast to the PVA gel, enhanced anabolism protein (COL2A1) expression and concurrently suppressed the expression of genes (P16,P21,IL1B,IL6,CCL2,TNF,ADAMTS5, andMMP13) and a protein (MMP13) related to catabolism (fig. S4, C and D). These findings suggest that the sonosensitive TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel has a regenerative effect on cellular activity of NPCs when subjected to US-induced conditions.

The elimination of US alone and the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel is essential. Live/dead staining assays demonstrated that TBHP + Gel marginally restored the fluorescence intensity relative to TBHP. TBHP + Gel + US markedly enhanced the fluorescence of live cells. Phalloidin staining indicated that TBHP + Gel + US treatment effectively restored the cellular cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 3C). In addition, the effects of TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogel on the anabolic and catabolic metabolism of NPCs were further explored. The RT-qPCR results revealed that after TBHP-induced modeling, the gel slightly alleviated the expression of a few inflammatory factors, whereas Gel + US substantially reduced their expression (Fig. 3D). WB analysis confirmed the expression trend of the aforementioned inflammatory factors at the protein level (Fig. 3E). Similarly, only Gel + US markedly restored the expression of the ECM anabolism–related protein COL2, which was reduced by TBHP, and decreased the expression of the ECM catabolism–related protein MMP13 and ADAMTS5 (Fig. 3F). Alcian blue staining of NPCs revealed that TBHP considerably inhibited their anabolic metabolism. The application of gel alone conferred a modest protective effect, whereas Gel + US robustly enhanced the proteoglycan anabolism phenotype of NPCs (Fig. 3G). In conclusion, for NPCs subjected to inflammatory induction, Gel + US markedly promoted NPC viability and anabolism, while US alone had no substantial effect.

We first investigated the impact of the sonoelectric effect from TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel NPCs during the initial stage. We used 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [DiSC3(5)] (45) to test the membrane potential of NPCs cocultured with the gel. Under US irradiation (0.3 W/cm2), a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity was observed within 5 min, suggesting transient depolarization of the NPC membrane (Fig. 4A). To investigate the metabolic changes that occur within NPCs following exposure to ultrasonic current and given that US alone has no substantial effect on NPC viability, we conducted mRNA sequencing on NPCs from four treatment groups: the control, TBHP, TBHP + Gel, and TBHP + Gel + US groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that, compared with the control, TBHP significantly down-regulated cell cycle–related pathways in NPCs (fig. S5A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) also revealed that the down-regulated genes were significantly associated with the cell cycle (fig. S5B). Compared with TBHP or TBHP + Gel, TBHP + Gel + US significantly up-regulated the cell cycle in KEGG pathways (Fig. 4Band fig. S5C), and the up-regulated enriched genes were also strongly related to the cell cycle (Fig. 4Cand fig. S5D). The mRNA sequencing data collectively illustrated that Gel + US effectively reversed the inflammation-induced attenuation of cell cycle metabolism in NPCs. The heatmap depicts gene expression patterns in the cell cycle pathway and clearly illustrates that TBHP induced substantial down-regulation of gene expression. Gel alone did not sufficiently counteract this suppression, which was able to be up-regulated by Gel + US (Fig. 4D). These genes regulate the phenotype of the downstream cell cycle. Cell cycle flow cytometry analysis of NPCs post–TBHP induction showed a near absence of cells in the G2-M phase relative to the control, with most cells exhibiting arrest in the G0-G1phase, which was not reversed by Gel. Gel + US markedly facilitated the progression of a portion of the TBHP-damaged NPCs into the G2-M phase (Fig. 4Eand fig. S6). Regarding cell cycle regulation of cell proliferation and metabolism, Gel + US not only markedly restored the viability of TBHP-injured NPCs, as detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Fig. 4F), but also notably restored anabolism (Fig. 3, D to G).

Recent studies reported that current induced cell membrane depolarization, subsequently triggering Cavopening and consequently facilitating Ca2+influx (25,27). NPCs were subjected to a Fluo-4 assay to detect Ca2+influx. The Ca2+content in the cytoplasm of the TBHP-induced NPCs was detected to exclude the influence of TBHP. The Ca2+concentration in NPCs temporarily increased within 12 hours after the addition of TBHP (fig. S7A). After 24 hours of pretreatment with TBHP, NPCs were subjected to various treatments, and the Fluo-4 assay results indicated that NPCs treated with Gel + US presented a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration, suggesting that ultrasonic current stimulates Ca2+influx (Fig. 4Gand fig. S7B). Hypothesizing that Ca2+influx through Cavactivates CaMKs (23–25), on the basis of a gene expression heatmap generated via mRNA sequencing, we found that CAMK1 expression in NPCs was down-regulated by TBHP but was observably up-regulated by Gel + US stimulation (Fig. 4H). Given the potential of CaMKs to activate CDKs (21,22) and the most pronounced reactivation of CDK1 and CDK2 in NPCs by Gel + US (Fig. 4D), we hypothesized that CaMK1 up-regulation further up-regulates its downstream targets CDK1 and CDK2. WB assay results initially elucidated that during the promotion of the cell cycle in NPCs by Gel + US after TBHP preincubation, the protein expression of CaMK1, CDK1, and CDK2 increased, and their phosphorylation levels also increased (Fig. 4I).

To initially verify whether ultrasonic current activates CaMK1 by opening Cavand facilitating Ca2+influx, we used the broad-spectrum Cavblocker benidipine (Ben, 1 μM) (46). The WB results indicated that in the TBHP + Gel + US + Ben group, the protein expression of CaMK1 and phosphorylated CaMK1 (P-CaMK1) in NPCs did not recover as observed in the TBHP + Gel + US group. Furthermore, the expression of the presumed downstream targets, namely, CDK1, phosphorylated CDK1 (P-CDK1), CDK2, and phosphorylated CDK2 (P-CDK2), was also weak (Fig. 4I). After Ben-mediated inhibition, Gel + US subsequently failed to rescue cells cycle arrest and effectively forced the cell cycle progression (Fig. 4Jand fig. S8A), increasing cellular viability (Fig. 4K). Compared with Gel + US, Gel + US + Ben treatment neither effectively restored the expression of the anabolic protein COL2 nor inhibited the expression of the catabolic protein MMP13 (Fig. 4L). These results suggest that the increased CaMK1 activity is regulated by ultrasonic current–induced Ca2+influx via Cav.

We used KN93 (30 μM), a nonspecific CaMK inhibitor (23), to investigate whether downstream CDK1 and CDK2 are regulated by CaMK1. Compared with that observed in the Gel + US–treated NPCs, the expression of activated CaMK1 (P-CaMK1) in the KN93-treated NPCs was substantially lower after TBHP preinduction; subsequently, the activity of CDK1, P-CDK1, CDK2, and P-CDK2 was also attenuated (Fig. 4M). Furthermore, KN93 administration mitigated the cells cycle arrest salvage and cell cycle propulsion induced by Gel + US after TBHP pretreatment (Fig. 4Nand fig. S8B), diminished the rescue of cellular viability typically achieved with Gel + US (Fig. 4O), attenuated the up-regulation of COL2 protein expression in NPCs stimulated with Gel + US, and made the down-regulation of MMP13 expression less pronounced (Fig. 4P). The experimental findings allow us to elucidate a molecular mechanism: The sonoelectric effect opens the Cavon the membrane of NPCs, facilitating the influx of Ca2+. This event activates CaMK1, which subsequently activates its downstream targets, CDK1 and CDK2. The activation of these CDKs propels the cell cycle forward, culminating in subsequent metabolic alterations and regeneration (Fig. 4Q).

Oxidative stress in NPCs triggers ferroptosis, which is recognized as a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IVDD (47). Considering the ROS-scavenging capabilities of the TSPBA hydrogel (35), we explored its potential to safeguard NPCs against oxidative stress–induced injury. Titanium oxysulfate was used to investigate the neutralizing effects of the gel on H2O2in a PBS solution. The control and US had minimal effects on H2O2levels. Compared with Gel, Gel + US (0.3 W/cm2) markedly increased the efficiency of H2O2neutralization, possibly because ultrasonic cavitation enhanced the redox reaction between H2O2and borate ester (Fig. 5A). Flow cytometry and fluorescence quantification were used to compare the intracellular ROS content in NPCs. TBHP substantially increased ROS levels in NPCs. In contrast, US showed minimal efficacy in eliminating ROS, whereas the gel exhibited a modest mitigating effect. Notably, Gel + US was the most effective at reducing the intracellular ROS concentration (Fig. 5, B and C). Consequently, it can be proved that the application of US accelerates the clearance of ROS by the Gel (TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA).

(G) In the LPO fluorescence staining of NPCs, the green positive signal indicates the presence of peroxidized lipids. In AO staining, the stronger the red signal, the less damage the endosomal membrane has suffered from ferroptosis. (H) Representative WB images of GPX4 protein in Control-, TBHP-, TBHP + Gel–, and TBHP + Gel + US–treated NPCs. Data in [(A) to (F)] are shown as means ± SD, withn= 3 biological replicates. Statistical significance in (C) was calculated using one-way ANOVA.

KEGG pathway analysis and GSEA of mRNA sequencing indicates that, compared with TBHP induction, ferroptosis was related to oxidative stress and was one of the most down-regulated pathways in NPCs treated with Gel + US (Fig. 5, D and E). Simultaneously, TBHP markedly up-regulated the ferroptosis compared to Control, and Gel + US down-regulated this pathway compared to Gel (fig. S9, A to D), which indicated that Gel + US can mitigate ferroptosis induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, in this mRNA sequencing analysis, the differential expression of genes in the ferroptosis pathway is clearly illustrated in a heatmap. TBHP substantially up-regulated ferroptosis-related genes; Gel slightly ameliorated the up-regulation induced by TBHP, whereas Gel + US markedly reduced their expression (Fig. 5F). ROS down-regulates the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in inhibiting lipid peroxidation (LPO) (48), which is also inhibited by Gel + US (Fig. 5F).

Given the fact that ROS leads to LPO, which is also a major phenotype of ferroptosis, we proceeded to assess the LPO levels in NPCs via a lipid droplet fluorescence detection assay. TBHP substantially increased intracellular LPO levels, an effect that was not effectively mitigated by Gel, whereas Gel + US effectively eliminated LPO (Fig. 5G). As ROS can damage the endosomal membrane (49), acridine orange (AO) staining is one of the phenotypes associated with ferroptosis (50).Figure 5Gshows that TBHP substantially reduced red fluorescence, indicating that the endosomal membrane was incomplete, with Gel demonstrating limited protective effects. In contrast, Gel + US provided the most effective protection (Fig. 5G). Ultimately, the key enzyme GPX4 involved in ferroptosis regulation, which was substantially down-regulated by TBHP, was markedly restored upon treatment with Gel + US (Fig. 5H). Overall, the extra protective role of the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel in NPCs not only facilitates the cell cycle but also mitigates ferroptosis by accelerating the clearance of ROS under US.

Because the size, intradiscal pressure, and range of motion of caprine lumber spines are similar to those of human lumber spines (51,52), caprine lumber spines were selected for this study. A cohort of 12 Boer goats was evenly distributed across four experimental groups [Control, Decompression (Decomp), Decomp + Gel, and Decomp + Gel + US]. Nine goats underwent IVD decompression on day 0. On the 7th day postsurgery, x-ray fluoroscopic monitoring revealed that the puncture needle was accurately localized to the IVD region. Three goats in both the Decomp + Gel and Decomp + Gel + US groups were injected with TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel into the IVD using a puncture needle, whereas the control group underwent a sham operation. On days 7, 14, 21, and 28, three goats from the Decomp + Gel + US group underwent 30 min of US irradiation of the lumbar area. By Day 42, all the goats were euthanized, followed by radiographic and histological evaluations (Fig. 6A).

(A) Schematic diagram of the experimental process in goats. IVD Decomp modeling surgery was performed on day 0, followed by gel injection into the IVD under fluoroscopic guidance on the 7th postoperative day. US irradiation was administered for 30 min on days 7, 14, 21, and 28, with euthanasia conducted on day 42. (B) Sagittal and axial MRI images of the goat IVD. The dark of the outer loop represents the AF, and the high-density inner area is NP. The yellow arrow points to the leaked NP. (C) Modified Pfirrmann grade is used to comprehensively evaluated the MRI images of IVD on day 42. (D) Safranin O, H&E, and Masson staining of histological sections of IVD tissues on day 42. (E) Histological grading of IVD was performed on the basis of the degree of degeneration observed in histological sections from each group on day 42. (F) CT images compare the intervertebral height in Control, Decomp, Decomp + Gel, and Decomp + Gel + US groups on day 42. (G) Disk height index collected from CT images compared between all groups on day 42. Heatmap showed the normalized data of RT-qPCR fold changes of ECM metabolism factors (H), cell cycle phenotype, and ferroptosis phenotype (I) related genes in goats’ paravertebral tissues on day 42. Data and error bars in [(C), (E), and (G)] represent the means ± SD, withn= 3 biological replicates. One-way ANOVA was performed.

On the basis of the sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the control group exhibited strong aqueous disc signals, indicating healthy and well-hydrated IVDs. In contrast, the Decomp group presented a significant reduction in signal intensity. The gel treatment resulted in a slight recovery of the signal, whereas the Gel + US therapy resulted in a more pronounced alleviation of signal loss (Fig. 6B). Axial T2 MR images were used to visualize the NP and annulus fibrosus (AF). Compared with the control treatment, decompression treatment severely decreased heterogeneity and hydration in the NP region. The border between the NP and AF appears indistinct, with the NP seemingly leaking into the AF (Fig. 6B, yellow arrow). Compared with the Decomp group, treatment with the gel appeared to mildly preserve the hydration and geometry of the NPs. Gel + US treatment resulted in goats with IVDs whose hydration and morphology were most similar to those of the control (Fig. 6B). The Pfirrmann grade, as determined using MRI, provides a quantitative evaluation of the aforementioned outcomes (Fig. 6C).

Morphological and histological assessments of IVD tissue were conducted using the mid-coronal plane section approach. Safranin O staining revealed the typical native structure of control IVDs, highlighting the homogeneous, proteoglycan-rich NP with a distinct red hue and intact lamellar bundles of AF. In the Decomp group, IVDs presented remarkable heterogeneity in the NP, characterized by the substantial disappearance of red staining and widespread blue staining. These changes reflect a marked focal loss of proteoglycans, the deposition of type I collagen, and advanced calcification. The Gel treatment afforded modest protection for the IVD, whereas the application of Gel + US markedly mitigated the depletion of proteoglycans and attenuated the pathological alterations in disc morphology (Fig. 6D). Masson staining further confirmed these findings, revealing a loss of cartilage (blue) at the decompressed IVD, which was replaced by pathologically deposited red-stained fibrin, scar tissue, and type I collagen. Gel treatment partially ameliorated this pathology, whereas Gel + US therapy markedly reversed IVDD, restoring blue staining to levels more similar to those of the control (Fig. 6D). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that Decomp noticeably induced inflammatory infiltration and morphological alterations in the IVD. The Gel treatment offered limited improvement, whereas the Gel + US treatment had the most pronounced therapeutic effect on the IVD (Fig. 6D). The histological staining grade was used to assess the severity of IVDD quantitatively, with Decomp markedly inducing IVDD. Treatment with Gel resulted in a moderate mitigation of degeneration; however, treatment with Gel + US exhibited considerably enhanced restoration of IVD compared to Gel alone (Fig. 6E).

Clinically, because of the loss and dehydration of NP tissue, IVDD progressively diminishes disc height, which compromises the capacity of the NP to withstand compressive stresses in the spine. Computed tomography (CT) and the disc height index elucidated that Decomp led to a substantial narrowing of the IVD space, indicating advanced degeneration. The gel treatment marginally maintained the disc height, whereas the Gel + US therapy more effectively preserved the disc height (Fig. 6, F and G).

Last, the IVDs from each group were harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR analysis to assess the metabolic conditions. The anabolic genes COL2A1, ACAN, and SOX9 were significantly down-regulated in the IVD tissues of the Decomp group, with no significant changes observed in the Decomp + Gel group compared with the Decomp group. In contrast, a noticeable restoration of the expression of these genes was detected in the Decomp + Gel + US group. In the Decomp group, the catabolism genes MMP13, ADAMTS5, COL1A1, COL10A1, and RUNX2 exhibited pronounced up-regulation in IVD tissues. Gel treatment alone did not effectively counteract this increase. In contrast, Gel + US treatment markedly attenuated their expression (Fig. 6H). In particular, previously validated genes integral to the cell cycle axis, CAMK1, CDK1, and CDK2, and other cell cycle phenotype–related genes (CCND1 and CCNE1), were significantly down-regulated in the IVD tissue of the Decomp and Decomp + Gel groups. The application of Gel + US led to pronounced up-regulation of these genes, suggesting the therapeutic modulation of cell cycle–related pathways by the sonosensitive TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel in vivo (Fig. 6I). Notably, both Decomp and Decomp + Gel groups exhibited marked down-regulation of GPX4 and SLC7A11 (a cystine transporter critical for glutathione synthesis) (53), alongside up-regulation of ACSL4, a key driver of LPO (54). Strikingly, Gel + US intervention restored GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression while suppressing ACSL4, demonstrating that the hydrogel therapeutically modulates ferroptosis-associated pathways in vivo (Fig. 6I).

In conclusion, the sonosensitive TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel has protective effects on goat IVD tissue, and its application in combination with US can partially facilitate IVD regeneration. In vivo experiments have substantiated the efficacy of this noninvasive sonosensitive gel therapy for IVDD, and its availability in large animal models strongly highlights its promising prospects for clinical translation.

In this study, we present a noninvasive therapeutic strategy for IVDD using a sonosensitive conductive hydrogel (TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA) designed to precisely modulate cell cycle progression and mitigate oxidative stress damage. The hydrogel leverages US-triggered microcurrent generation to activate endogenous regenerative pathways within degenerative IVD. At the micro level, US irradiation induces free electron excitation in the TCPP@PPy particles, creating a localized electrical microenvironment that depolarizes NPC membranes. This depolarization opens Cav, driving Ca2+influx and activating the Ca2+/CaMK1 signaling axis, which subsequently up-regulates and phosphorylate CDK1 and CDK2 to propel cell cycle progression. Concurrently, the hydrogel’s ROS-responsive borate ester bonds enhance scavenging of ROS under US, effectively suppressing ferroptosis in NPCs. Validated in a caprine IVDD model, this dual-action strategy restored disc hydration, ECM homeostasis, and structural integrity, as evidenced by MRI, histology, and molecular profiling. Our findings establish a paradigm for noninvasive tissue regeneration through spatiotemporal control of microcurrent and biochemical microenvironment niche, addressing critical limitations of invasive surgical and transient pharmacological interventions.

The management of IVDD remains a formidable clinical challenge, constrained by the limitations of existing therapeutic paradigms. Surgical interventions, such as discectomy or spinal fusion, provide symptomatic relief but inevitably disrupt disc biomechanics and accelerate adjacent segment degeneration, failing to restore native tissue functionality (3). Regenerative strategies, including stem cell therapy and biomaterial-based scaffolds, aim to replenish lost NPCs and ECM (4). However, the harsh microenvironment of degenerative discs—characterized by hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and chronic inflammation—severely compromises transplanted cell viability and ECM synthesis (1,2,4,55). For instance, animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that the survival rate of cells injected into IVD is low (~18%), the therapeutic effects are inconsistent, and potential complications such as osteophyte formation and lower back pain may occur (56). Similarly, synthetic hydrogels designed for mechanical support often lack dynamic responsiveness to pathological cues, resulting in passive degradation without triggering endogenous repair (4,57,58). Recent advances in US-mediated therapies have introduced previously unidentified avenues for noninvasive modulation. Studies have demonstrated that sonosensitive biomaterials, under controlled US stimulation, can release cytotoxic agents (ROS and heat), enhance drug release and tissue penetration, and generate electrical effects, thereby achieving therapeutic outcomes such as antimicrobial activity, tumor suppression, and cell or tissue regeneration (59–62). Concurrently, emerging bioelectronic strategies—such as triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators for bone regeneration (63), and implantable zinc-oxygen batteries for neural repair (64)—demonstrate the broad potential of electroactive therapies in tissue regeneration. Yet, percutaneous electrical stimulation’s inability to spatially target deep spinal structures and maintain stable current delivery limits efficacy, often causing off-target muscle contractions or tissue damage (65,66). The cell cycle is one of the core molecular biological processes that drive cell growth (5,6), and modulating this intricate mechanism may essentially promote tissue regeneration. However, sufficient evidence indicates that prolonged cell cycle arrest ultimately leads to reduced viability, senescence, or cell death (8–10,67,68). Targeting cell cycle regulation to revitalize quiescent NPCs represents a crucial yet underdeveloped therapeutic avenue. CDKs, central drivers of proliferation, have been successfully activated in cardiomyocytes and immune cells to reverse fibrosis or enhance immunomodulation (12,18). Here, in IVDD, NPCs are arrested in G0-G1because of TBHP oxidative stress and senescence induction (Figs. 4and5), a pathology in traditional regenerative approaches that overlook cell cycle dynamics. This study aims to develop a strategy for controllable, noninvasive, and efficient deep IVD regeneration by using US to precisely drive the cell cycle.

Our work delineates a physically biochemically innovative paradigm. In this research, PPy, a biocompatible and conductive polymer with wide application potential (69,70), was selected to encapsulate the sonosensitizer TCPP to manufacture sonosensitive particles denoted as TCPP@PPy. The TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogel generates spatially confined microcurrents under US, enabling precise Cavchannel activation without off-target effects. This precision current stems from the tailored electronic structure of TCPP@PPy particles: Compared to conventional conductive polymers PPy alone, the TCPP@PPy composite exhibits superior sonoelectronic conversion efficiency (Fig. 2A). The mechanistic foundation of this technology lies in the unique electronic structure of the photosensitizer and sonosensitizer. In molecular orbital theory,HOMOrepresents the highest energy level containing electrons at equilibrium state, whileLUMOdenotes the lowest energy level available for electron excitation. US waves act core of sonosensitive materials core and provide sufficient energy (ΔE=ELUMO−EHOMO) (43) to trigger interorbital electron transitions. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that PPy encapsulation reduces theHOMO-LUMObandgap from 1.64 eV (pure TCPP) to 1.28 eV (Fig. 2, B to E), optimizing electron excitation and generating an ultrasonic current with an amplitude of approximately 0.1 μA/cm2. In comparison, previously reported TCPP-based sonosensitizers exhibited a smaller bandgap reduction (1.90 to 1.80 eV) and a lower sonic current amplitude (~0.021 μA/cm2) (71), highlighting the markedly superior performance of this system. The resultant ultrasonic current induces rapid NPC membrane depolarization (Fig. 4A), triggering Ca2+influx through Cavchannels (Fig. 4G). This Ca2+surge activates CaMK1, which phosphorylates CDK1/2 (Fig. 4, I and M), directly coupling bioelectrical stimuli to cell cycle progression. Notably, this pathway provides a direct mechanism to override G0-G1arrest and enhance cell viability.

Beyond cell cycle modulation, the hydrogel’s ROS-scavenging capability introduces a dual therapeutic axis. While borate ester–based systems (TSPBA) (35) passively degrade in oxidative stress environments, US-enhanced cavitation in our hydrogel accelerates more significant ROS neutralization and ferroptosis alleviation compared to static conditions (Fig. 5). Although prior studies using TSPBA-based hydrogels demonstrated that ROS-responsive degradation plateaued within 2 hours (72), our sonosensitive system, under US stimulation, notably accelerated the scavenging kinetics to approximately 1 hour (Fig. 5, A and B). This clearance effect not only preserves GPX4 (48) and SLC7A11 (53) expression (Figs. 5, F and H, and6I)—key suppressors of ferroptosis—but also reduces LPO and ACSL4 (A key driver of LPO) (54) expression (Figs. 5Gand6I). Notably, previous studies suggest that Ca2+-dependent pathways may activate the Nrf2 antioxidant axis. Ca2+/CAMKII signaling has been shown to phosphorylate Nrf2, promoting its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of detoxifying enzymes (e.g., HO-1 and GCLC) that counteract LPO (73,74). Nrf2 activation is a well-established suppressor of ferroptosis through GPX4 stabilization and glutathione synthesis (53,75), aligning with our observed ferroptosis rescue. These advances merge into a “sonoelectric niche”—a dynamically tunable biochemical-physical microenvironment (76,77) where US-triggered electrical currents and ROS-responsive hydrogel properties synergistically regulate cellular signaling, enhancing endogenous regenerative pathways and enabling noninvasive spatiotemporal control over tissue repair. While prior studies leveraged piezoelectric scaffolds (61) to modulate tissue repair, none achieved spatiotemporal coordination of electrophysiological and metabolic pathways. Our sonosensitive hydrogel uniquely bridges this gap, simultaneously driving cell cycle progression (via CDK1/2) and suppressing ferroptosis (via GPX4/SLC7A11). This multimodal action explains the superior efficacy of Gel + US over Gel alone in restoring disc height and ECM anabolism in vivo (Fig. 6).

Our sonosensitive hydrogel system represents marked advancements over existing strategies for IVDD treatment in terms of noninvasive drug delivery and treatment mode, material design, and therapeutic efficacy. The IVD is located deep within the body. In this study, we developed a noninvasive therapeutic strategy that involves precise puncture and injection of an in situ gel-forming agent directly into the IVD under x-ray fluoroscopic guidance (Fig. 6A). The TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA gel responds to external US induction to treat IVDD. Unlike percutaneous electrical stimulation, which struggles to target deep spinal structures due to rapid current dissipation, our hydrogel localizes microcurrents directly within the disc. Animal model outcomes further validate the translational relevance of this strategy. Caprine lumbar discs, which closely mimic human spinal biomechanics in terms of size, intradiscal pressure, and range of motion (51,52), exhibited approximately a 162.5% disc height index improvement based on MRI, a 46.7% improvement in Pfirrmann MRI score, and a 48.7% recovery in histological grade based on histological staining, after Gel + US treatment compared to IVDD (Fig. 6, C to E). These therapeutic outcomes not only basically matched conventional hydrogel treatments effect (4,57,58) but also demonstrated statistically superior disc height index restoration compared to rodents (~118%) (78) and sheep model (~16.5%) (52). Our therapeutic strategy uses noninvasive US-mediated spatiotemporal control to precisely activate endogenous molecular pathways, driving histological analysis–demonstrated substantial restoration of proteoglycan content (Fig. 6, D, H, and I), and achieving functional tissue regeneration—a critical regenerative metric markedly surpassing conventional hydrogel-based or ROS-scavenging therapies (52,72). The feasibility of this strategy in a goat IVDD model highlights its potential for clinical translation.

To ensure optimal biological performance, biomaterials must exhibit both in vivo biocompatibility and sufficient stability under physiological conditions. For example, although glycine-based sonosensitive piezoelectric biomaterials exhibit excellent biocompatibility, unencapsulated formulations undergo complete dissolution within 5 min in aqueous environments. Even after structural optimization, rapid degradation occurs within hours to a few days, accompanied by significant functional decay (79–81). In this study, the hydrogel demonstrated low cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A) and robust in vivo biosafety (Fig. 6). This biomaterial remained stable under physiological conditions but underwent efficient degradation under pathological ROS stimulation (Fig. 1K), indicating its responsiveness and controlled fate in disease environments. Time-resolved FTIR and TEM analyses further confirmed the structural and morphological stability of TCPP@PPy particles (fig. S1, F and G), while ultrasonic current and PL measurements across time gradients demonstrated their functional stability (fig. S3, A and B). Collectively, these findings confirm that our hydrogel maintains biosafety and stability, thereby ensuring effective therapeutic performance.

While our study establishes a promising noninvasive strategy for IVDD, several limitations require further attention. First, the approach does not involve genetic modification of cells to provide a durable self-regeneration capacity, implying that degenerated tissues might necessitate prolonged in vitro US treatment sessions. Second, there is a pressing need for increased sonoelectric efficiency to increase treatment effectiveness. Future work should incorporate that piezoelectric nanoparticles might enable self-sustaining current generation under mechanical loading, mimicking physiological disc motion. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing of treated NPCs could delineate subpopulation-specific responses to sonoelectronic stimuli, identifying molecular checkpoints for personalized intervention. By leveraging gene-editing platform, this integrated approach combines gene-editing tools with tunable acoustic stimulation, enabling the precise refinement of sonoelectronic parameters to spatiotemporally regulate key electrochemistry signaling pathways and establishing a framework for the real-time control of sonoelectric responsive gene circuits.

In this study, we developed a sonoelectric hydrogel by synthesizing sonosensitive particles of TCPP@PPy and incorporating them into a PPy/PVA polymer, followed by cross-linking with the ROS-sensitive agent TSPBA to form the hydrogel (TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA). TCPP@PPy overcomes theHOMO-LUMOgap to excite free electrons under US, resulting in the formation of an ultrasonic current in hydrogel. This ultrasonic current alters the membrane potential of NPCs, triggering Ca2+influx and activating the Ca2+-CaMK1-CDK1/2 signaling axis. This cascade advances the cell cycle and promotes cell regeneration. Simultaneously, this ROS-responsive hydrogel accelerates the clearance of ROS under US exposure, mitigating ferroptosis caused by oxidative stress in cells. This sonoelectric niche, which creates a dynamically regulated biochemical-physical microenvironment through the sonoelectrical effect, has demonstrated promising regenerative therapeutic effects in a goat model of IVDD, offering a previously unexplored choice for treating other deep-seated degenerative disorders, such as osteoarthritis, where invasive interventions remain irreplaceable. Future iterations of this technology will be enhanced through a multidimensional optimization framework encompassing bandgap engineering, genetic engineering, and patient-specific US protocols. In summary, this convergence of sonosensitive hydrogels with noninvasive spatiotemporal control establishes a notable therapeutic mode to precisely orchestrate tissue regeneration, demonstrating transformative potential for tissue regeneration.

The synthesis of TCPP@PPy particles was performed according to a previous report (36) with minor modifications: A 20-ml aqueous ethanol solution (50% v/v) was used to dissolve pyrrole (0.1 M) and TCPP (1 mM). The mixture was subjected to ultrasonic homogenization for 1 hour, followed by the addition of 57 mg of ammonium persulfate (APS). Then, the solution was mixed at room temperature for 24 hours. Centrifugation of the mixture at 12,000 rpm for 5 min resulted in the isolation of a purplish black product. Following a triple wash with ethanol, the product was dried at 60°C overnight to obtain a powder product (TCPP@PPy), which was subsequently stored in a desiccator.

The preparation of the TSPBA cross-linker was informed by an established study (35): Briefly, 0.1 g ofN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine and 0.5 g of 4-(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid were dissolved in 10 ml of dimethylformamide, and the mixture was stirred overnight at 60°C. The reaction mixture was transferred into 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and subjected to filtration, followed by successive washes with THF (three portions of 20 ml each). The product was then dried under vacuum overnight, yielding TSPBA.

A 10-ml solution of 9% PVA was prepared. Then, pyrrole and the oxidant APS were added to the PVA solution to achieve a concentration of 0.1 M, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight to obtain a PPy/PVA polymer solution. Briefly, 10 mg of TCPP@PPy powder was added to 10 ml of PPy/PVA solution (1 mg/ml) and thoroughly dispersed via an ultrasonic homogenizer. Subsequently, dual pipettes with closely fitted tips were used to simultaneously deliver the TCPP@PPy-infused PPy/PVA solution and the TSPBA solution into the plate wells, inducing rapid in situ gelation and producing the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogel. To fabricate the intermediate control TCPP/PPy/PVA hydrogel, 10 mg of TCPP powder was added to 10 ml of PPy/PVA solution and thoroughly dispersed, followed by cross-linking using the same method described previously.

TCPP@PPy powder samples were placed in a centrifuge tube with ethanol and sonicated at room temperature for 5 min. A few droplets of the resulting suspension were deposited onto a silicon wafer and allowed to dry for analysis. The freeze-dried hydrogel was directly affixed to the sample stage using conductive adhesive. The chamber was then vented, and the sample was carefully positioned inside. The chamber was then evacuated to achieve the required vacuum level. Once the desired vacuum was attained, the voltage was increased. The sample location was identified, and an appropriate magnification was selected. High-resolution images were scanned and saved for further analysis.

The TCPP@PPy powder was resuspended in ethanol and ultrasonically dispersed. A suitable amount of the dispersion was dropped onto a sample grid and dried. The prepared sample was then placed on the sample holder. Parameters such as the electron beam, aperture, focus, and astigmatism were adjusted to achieve optimal brightness. The specific location of the sample was identified for imaging.

In a dry environment, TCPP@PPy powder was mixed with potassium bromide powder. The mixture was then pressed to form a pellet for use in infrared spectroscopy analysis. For the hydrogel, an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory was positioned in the optical path of the spectrometer. A background scan of the air was performed. The surface of the hydrogel sample was pressed firmly against the crystal surface of the ATR accessory, and the infrared spectrum of the hydrogel was collected.

The hydrogel samples for testing were fabricated using a mold to achieve dimensions of 5 mm by 8 mm (radius by thickness). Compression tests were conducted at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min, and the acquired data were used to calculate the compressive stress curve.

Under a 1.2 W/cm2US irradiation regime, the ultrasonic current induced in the sample was measured using a standard three-electrode system in an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, 600E). Briefly, a 1 mM solution of TCPP@PPy was mixed with a 5% Nafion solution at a volume ratio of 10:1. Aliquots of 200 μl of this mixture were drop-cast onto indium tin oxide (ITO)–coated glass (15 mm by 30 mm by 1.1 mm) and allowed to dry. This process was repeated three times. The hydrogel samples were gelled in situ on ITO glass. The ITO glass, affixed to the working electrode, was immersed alongside a platinum electrode and a reference electrode in a 0.5 M Na2SO4solution. A US probe was used to irradiate the sample cell with cycles of 20 s per switch. The electrochemical workstation captured the ultrasonic current generated within the system, and subsequent data analysis was conducted using CHI version 22.01 software.

The PL properties of the powder and hydrogel samples were characterized using a fluorescence spectrophotometry (PerkinElmer, LS55). The sample was prepared by dispersing TCPP or TCPP@PPy in a suitable solvent to ensure a homogeneous suspension. The hydrogel samples were directly used for testing. The excitation wavelength was selected on the basis of the maximum absorption peak identified from the UV-Vis absorption spectra. The emission spectra were recorded over a range spanning the characteristic emission profile of the sample. All measurements were performed at a controlled temperature, and the sample was allowed to equilibrate for a defined period before data collection. The PL quantum yield was determined relative to a standard reference compound with a known quantum yield, following the protocol outlined in the IUPAC Technical Report (82).

The UV-vis absorption properties of the TCPP and TCPP/PPy powders were characterized via a standard spectrophotometer (UV-3600). A precisely measured quantity of powder sample was dispersed in a suitable solvent to ensure a homogeneous solution. The resulting solution was then placed in a quartz cuvette, and the absorbance was measured over a wavelength range from UV to the visible spectrum. The spectrophotometer was calibrated with a blank solvent sample to correct for any background absorbance. The data were analyzed to determine the absorption maxima and molar absorptivity, providing insights into the electronic transitions within the TCPP and TCPP/PPy molecules.

NPCs were harvested using a previously reported pronase-collagenase digestion method (83). NP tissues were obtained from discectomy procedures following informed consent. Under sterile conditions, surgical specimens were meticulously separated from adjacent cartilaginous and AF components, followed by mechanical dissociation into 1- to 2-mm3fragments. Tissue digestion was performed using a 0.3% collagenase II/0.2% pronase solution with agitation at 37°C for 3.5 ± 0.5 hours. The obtained cell suspension underwent gradient centrifugation (1000g, 10 min) and triple PBS washing before resuspension in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Primary cultures were maintained under standard conditions (5% CO2and 37°C) with media changes every 72 hours, limiting cell expansion to passage 2 to preserve phenotype integrity. This protocol received institutional review board approval by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (no. S341), in full compliance with Helsinki Declaration guidelines.

The NPCs were resuspended in a solution of PPy/PVA mixed with TCPP@PPy and then cross-linked with TSPBA to obtain a 3D culture system of NPCs in a TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogel, ultimately reaching a concentration of 2.5 × 106cells/ml, as described in a reported protocol for NPC 3D culture (44). F12 medium was added to culture the cells. After various treatments, the NPC-loaded hydrogels were incubated with calcein AM/propidium iodide (PI) (Beyotime) working solution at 37°C for 30 min. 3D fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser microscope (Nikon C2Si).

The hydrogel was shaped into thin slices via a mold and then overlaid onto the cells cultured on a six-well plate to facilitate contact with the cells. Briefly, apoptosis was induced in NPCs upon treatment with 200 μM TBHP for 24 hours. Then, the cells were treated daily with US, Gel, or Gel + US for 15 min for 3 days. The cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. The NPCs were subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled phalloidin (Solarbio) for 40 min, and the cell nuclei were subsequently stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX71).

The treatment of the cells was consistent with the aforementioned methods. The cells were pretreated with 3% acetic acid for 3 min at room temperature to ensure an appropriate acidic environment. Subsequently, 1% Alcian blue solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. The cells were then washed two to three times with a 3% acetic acid solution, followed by rinsing with distilled water. The staining results were observed under a microscope.

We established a 3D culture system for NPCs using PVA or TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA hydrogels. After 24 hours of induction with 200 μM TBHP, the NPC-gel compound underwent daily 15-min treatments with US for 3 days or was maintained without intervention. After three washes with PBS, the NPC-gel compounds were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The samples were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 60 min to minimize nonspecific interactions, after which they were stained with rabbit anti-collagen 2 (Bioss Antibodies, bs-0709R) overnight at 4°C. The samples were then incubated with an Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G secondary antibody (Abcam, ab150088) for 60 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. A confocal microscope was used to scan the samples.

The hydrogel was shaped into thin slices via a mold and then overlaid onto the cells cultured on a six-well plate to facilitate contact with the cells. After the induction of NPC apoptosis with 200 μM TBHP for 24 hours, which was followed by daily treatment with Gel or Gel + US for 15 min for 3 days, the cells were washed with PBS three times. Next, a Lipid Droplets Green Fluorescence Assay Kit with BODIPY 493/503 (Beyotime) was used to stain the cells for 30 min. Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal microscope.

The treatment of the cells was the same as that described above. To ensure the integrity of the lysosomal membrane, an AO staining kit (Beyotime) was used to stain the cells for 20 min, followed by image acquisition via confocal microscopy.

Following the aforementioned treatments, for fluorescence microscopy detection, NPCs were washed once with PBS. Fluo-4 staining solution was then added. The cells were incubated at 37°C in the dark for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS. The staining effect was observed under a fluorescence microscope (λex= 490 nm, λem= 525 nm). NPCs collected at various time points were assessed with a microplate reader (λex= 490 nm, λem= 525 nm).

The hydrogel was shaped into thin slices using a mold and then overlaid onto the cells cultured on a six-well plate to facilitate contact with the cells. Following various treatments for NPCs, RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then reverse transcribed into cDNA. RT-qPCR was subsequently conducted for quantitative analysis of gene expression, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as an internal control to normalize the expression levels. The relative expression levels of the target genes were determined using the 2-ΔΔCTmethod. The primers used in this study are listed in table S1.

Posttreatment, the NPCs were washed twice with PBS and subsequently incubated with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor. The cells were lysed on ice for 15 min, ultrasonically crushed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 13,000gfor 15 min at 4°C. The lysed supernatant was aspirated into prechilled EP tubes, and the protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Forty micrograms of protein was separated via 8 to 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto 0.22- or 0.45-nm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes according to the molecular weight of the proteins. The PVDF membrane was incubated in 5% BSA for 1 hour to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by washing with 0.1% Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) four times. The membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies against P16 (AF5484, Affinity), P21 (10355-1-AP, Proteintech), interleukin -1B (IL-1B) (26048-1-AP, Proteintech), IL-6 (DF6087, Affinity), CCL2 (DF7577, Affinity), tumor necrosis factor–α (AF7014, Affinity), COL2 (AF5456, Affinity), MMP13 (18165-1-AP, Proteintech), ADAMTS5 (DF13268, Affinity), CaMK1 (DF7805, Affinity), phospho-CaMK1 (Thr177, AF7381, Affinity), CDK1 (10762-1-AP, Proteintech), phospho-CDK1/CDC2 (Thr161, AF8001, Affinity), CDK2 (10122-1-AP, Proteintech), or phospho-CDK2 (Thr160, AF3237, Affinity) overnight at 4°C and subsequently with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Following four rinses with 0.1% TBST to eliminate nonspecific antibody binding, the membrane was subjected to chemiluminescent detection with a substrate. The resulting luminescent signals were then accurately captured via a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).

The activity of sonosensitive hydrogel-induced membrane depolarization was assessed by quantifying the fluorescence emitted by the membrane potential–sensitive dye DiSC3(5). Following the aforementioned treatments, the NPC samples from each time point were centrifuged, washed twice with washing buffer [20 mM glucose and 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.2)], and resuspended in the same buffer [20 mM glucose, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.2)] containing 0.1 M KCl to a final optical density at 600 nm of 0.05. The cells (100 μl) were subsequently incubated with 20 nM DiSC3(5) for 15 min until a stable decrease in fluorescence was observed, indicating that the dye had integrated into the cell membrane. Membrane depolarization was monitored by observing the changes in the fluorescence emission intensity of DiSC3(5) (λex= 622 nm, λem= 670 nm).

Total NPC RNA from the control, TBHP, TBHP + Gel, and TBHP + Gel + US groups was extracted via TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). After quality and integrity were assessed, the RNA samples were quantified, and RNA sequencing libraries were constructed. The raw sequencing data were curated in SeqHealth (Wuhan, China) using STRA software (version 2.5.3a) to map the reads onto the human reference genome under default parameters. Differential gene expression across groups was analyzed using the dgeR package (version 3.12.1), which uses aPvalue threshold of 0.05 and a fold change magnitude of 2 to define statistical significance. Subsequent functional enrichment analyses and KEGG pathway analysis were performed with KOBAS software (version 2.1.1), and aPvalue cutoff of 0.05 was used to discern significant enrichment.

An ROS assay kit (Beyotime) was used to detect the ROS content in the NPCs. The hydrogel was shaped into thin slices via a mold and then overlaid onto the NPCs cultured on a six-well plate to facilitate contact with the cells. After the induction of NPC apoptosis with 200 μM TBHP for 24 hours, the NPCs were treated daily with US, Gel, or Gel + US for 15 min for 3 days. NPCs were washed three times with PBS, followed by the addition of 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) diluted in serum-free medium at a 1:1000 ratio to yield a final concentration of 10 μM. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove excess DCFH-DA. The fluorescence was measured using a flow cytometer (λex= 488 nm, λem= 525 nm).

A Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis Kit (Beyotime) was used to assess the NPC cell cycle. Following treatment, the NPCs were washed and centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-chilled 70% ethanol, and fixed at 4°C for more than 30 min. After centrifugation at 1000gfor 5 min, the NPCs were washed with 1 ml of ice-chilled PBS and centrifuged again to remove the supernatant. Briefly, 0.5 ml of PI solution was added to each tube, and the cell pellets were gently and thoroughly resuspended, followed by incubation in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. Red fluorescence was detected using a flow cytometer with excitation at a wavelength of 488 nm.

The animal experiment protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Animal Experiment Center, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (S2895), and the study was conducted under the principle of blinding. Twelve 6-month-old male Boer goats, randomly and evenly divided into four groups—Control, Decomp, Decomp + Gel, and Decomp + Gel + US—were acclimated in a separate room under quiet conditions for a period of 2 weeks before undergoing Decomp surgery for IVDD modeling. During the surgical procedure, anesthesia was induced and maintained via continuous mask administration of isoflurane gas. The surgery was performed via a posterior approach through the goats’ lumbar region, involving gradual dissection of the skin, fascia, and muscles, followed by exploration of the lumbar vertebrae. The surgical procedure was performed in a manner that minimized the size of the incision, tissue dissection, and overall trauma. For goats in the Decomp, Decomp + Gel, and Decomp + Gel + US groups, a scalpel was used to puncture the L3-L4and L4-L5IVDs, after which NP forceps were used to extract equivalent amounts of NP tissue, achieving the desired decompression. The control goats underwent a sham operation. The incised muscles and epithelium of the goats were sutured at the end of surgery. On the 7th day after surgery, for the goats in the Decomp + Gel and Decomp + Gel + US groups, two puncture needles were used to inject the TCPP@PPy-PPy/PVA solution and the TSPBA cross-linker into the IVD, allowing for in situ gelation. The procedure was performed under real-time x-ray fluoroscopy (DTP570A, Anjian, China) monitoring using DXRay Diagnostic software. On days 7, 14, 21, and 28, Decomp + Gel + US goats received 30 min of US irradiation (1.2 W/cm2) in the corresponding lumbar region. On day 42 after surgery, all the goats were anesthetized for MRI (WANDONG, i_Space 1.5 T) and CT (Canon, Tsx303A) analysis, followed by euthanasia. IVD tissue samples from the goats were collected, and hard tissue sections were prepared for RT-qPCR and histological examination (Safranin O, H&E, and Masson staining).

The data are expressed as the means ± SDs and were analyzed using either Origin 8 or GraphPad Prism 8 software. All experiments were biologically repeated at least three times. The statistical significance of variance was assessed via one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).P> 0.05 was classified as not statistically significant (ns), whereasP< 0.05 denoted statistical significance.
