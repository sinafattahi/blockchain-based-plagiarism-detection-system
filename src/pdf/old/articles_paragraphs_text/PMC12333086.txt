Adolescent pregnancy remains a critical public health challenge in Ghana, accounting for a significant proportion of unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and adverse health outcomes. This study explored urban-rural differences in caregivers’ willingness to support adolescent girls’ contraceptive use, focusing on Awutu Senya East (urban) and Jaman North (rural) districts. A cross-sectional comparative design was employed, involving 366 caregivers. Data were collected using structured surveys and analyzed through descriptive, comparative, and modified Poisson regression techniques. Findings revealed that 68% of caregivers expressed willingness to support adolescent contraceptive use, with higher support in rural areas (76.2%) than in urban areas (63.5%). Key factors influencing caregiver willingness included gender, residential setting, and income level. Female caregivers and those in rural settings demonstrated greater support, while cultural beliefs significantly shaped attitudes toward contraceptive use. Caregivers cited pregnancy prevention, STI reduction, and health improvement as primary motivations for support, while concerns about promiscuity, infertility, and cultural or religious objections were common barriers. The study highlights the importance of addressing socio-cultural misconceptions, enhancing caregiver knowledge, and fostering supportive attitudes through targeted interventions. This study recommends community-based education, affordable contraception policies, and integrated family planning initiatives to enhance caregiver support and improve adolescent reproductive health outcomes.

Adolescent pregnancy is a significant public health issue globally, particularly in Sub-Sahara Africa, where rates are among the highest in the world. An estimated 21 million girls aged 15–19 in developing countries become pregnant each year, but only about 12 million give birth [1]. Among these pregnancies, a substantial proportion are unintended, and end up in abortion [2,3] This data suggests that the remaining pregnancies may end in miscarriage or stillbirth. In 2022, about 13% of adolescent girls and young women globally gave birth before reaching 18 years of age, with more than 90% of these births occurring in low- and middle-income countries [4,5]. Teenage pregnancies are significantly associated with negative health consequences, such as premature delivery, underweight newborns, and pregnancy-induced hypertension, as well as other social consequences [6,7].

Ghana’s demographic profile reveals a significant reproductive health concern, with nearly half of the population under the age of 20, of which 22% are adolescents aged 10 to 19 [8]. This youthful demographic data underscores the urgent need to address issues related to adolescent health and development, particularly the high incidence of teenage pregnancies. Fifteen per cent (15%) of Ghanaian women aged 15–19 have experienced pregnancy, with 11% having given birth and 4% having suffered a pregnancy loss [9]. Additionally, the prevalence of induced abortion among adolescents and young women aged 15–24 is notably high, with approximately 26% reporting having undergone the procedure [10].

To address these pressing issues, it is essential to recognize that the high prevalence of teenage pregnancies and induced abortions in Ghana is intricately linked to early sexual initiation among adolescents [11]. This early onset of sexual activity not only heightens the risk of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections but also exacerbates existing socioeconomic challenges [11]. Data shows that 13.2% of adolescents in Ghana report engaging in sexual activity before or at the age of 14, with females (15.9%) more likely to report early sexual debut than males (10.6%) [11]. Early sexual debut is often associated with poorer socioeconomic status and outcomes, lower educational attainment, and reduced parental oversight responsibilities [12], further contributing to the cycle of poverty and poor health outcomes among adolescents [13].

Regional disparities in sexual behavior and adolescent pregnancy rates are evident in Ghana, with notable differences between rural and urban areas. Adolescents in rural regions report higher rates of sexual activity (24%) compared to their urban counterparts (19.7%) [14]. Correspondingly, adolescent pregnancy rates are significantly higher in rural areas (19.5%) than in urban areas (10.6%) [8,15]. These disparities highlight the impact of socio-cultural and structural factors on adolescent reproductive health. For example, access to contraception and sexual and reproductive education, a key strategy for preventing unintended pregnancies, is notably lower among Ghanaian adolescents in rural areas. Only 17% of sexually active adolescent girls not in union use contraceptives, compared to 22.2% among those in union. This implies that more than half of sexually active adolescent girls in Ghana who wish to avoid or delay childbearing are not utilizing any form of contraception [8]. This gap underscores the need for targeted interventions to improve contraceptive access and reproductive health education, especially in rural communities.

Caregiver, as used in this study, is a parent, guardian, or responsible adult who provides support, guidance, and protection, meeting the emotional, physical, and developmental needs of those in their care. Caregivers play a pivotal role in shaping adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health behaviors [16]. Their support, or lack thereof, is often critical in determining whether adolescents use contraceptives. Studies have demonstrated that positive parental attitudes toward contraception, coupled with open discussions about sexual health, are associated with higher rates of contraceptive use among adolescents [17–19]. However, only 31.7% of Nigerian caregivers supported contraceptive use for unmarried adolescents [18].

Conversely, parental disapproval, often rooted in cultural and religious beliefs, is a significant barrier to contraceptive uptake among adolescents [19,20]. In many cases, parents oppose the use of modern contraceptives due to the misconception that they promote promiscuity, concerns about infertility and the unrealistic belief that their children are not sexually active [18,20,21]. Due to these reasons, some caregivers are reluctant to allow their adolescent girl child specifically to use contraceptives.

Equally, positive parental communication is associated with increased contraceptive use, but the overall effect is modest [22]. However, poor communication between caregivers and adolescents, along with negative attitudes toward sex education, further limits adolescents’ access to reproductive health services [23]. Adolescents who received contraceptive education from parents or guardians were more likely to use modern contraceptives consistently than those who did not [24]. This suggests that parents’ knowledge of contraception, which may be attributed to their contraceptive use, plays a significant role in influencing their daughters’ contraceptive behaviors. While some parents generally may have a high level of awareness about contraceptives, their willingness to support adolescent contraceptive use is often limited. Indeed, only a small proportion of parents actively encourage their adolescent children to use contraceptives [18]. Other factors such as education level, marital status, and religion also influence parental attitudes towards adolescent contraceptive use [18,25]. Findings from a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) further highlight the consequences of these attitudes, as girls who experience unintended pregnancies due to early sexual initiation may face rejection from their parents, who often feel betrayed and disappointed. As a result, these girls are compelled to seek employment to support themselves and their unborn child, enduring significant hardships throughout pregnancy and childbirth [11].

Given these dynamics, thus, understanding caregivers’ willingness to support adolescent contraceptive use, particularly in the context of the socio-cultural differences between urban and rural areas, is essential for developing interventions aimed at reducing adolescent pregnancy rates. This study therefore explores and compares the willingness of caregivers in urban and rural Ghana to support contraceptive use among adolescent girls while identifying the factors influencing their attitudes as well as reasons to allow or not allow contraceptive use among their girls and provides insights for policies and programs to improve adolescent reproductive health in Ghana. Despite the availability and accessibility of contraceptive services in Ghana, teenage girls, especially those in rural areas, continue to have high rates of unplanned pregnancies [15]. While caregivers are known to have a substantial influence on adolescents’ reproductive health choices, particularly concerning contraceptive use [18], there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the willingness of caregivers, both in urban and rural settings, to support adolescents’ contraceptive use. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by determining and comparing the proportion of caregivers in urban and rural areas of Ghana who are willing to support contraceptive use among adolescent girls, and by identifying the factors that influence their willingness and their reasons to support or not to support adolescent girls on contraceptive use.

This study employed a cross-sectional comparative design, using a structured survey to collect data from caregivers in both urban and rural settings using an electronic data collection tool (KoboCollect).

The study was conducted in the Awutu Senya East Municipal (urban setting) and the Jaman North District (rural setting) of Ghana. These municipal and district assemblies were chosen due to their contrasting urbanization levels and the availability of health services, which provide a favorable basis for comparison.

As of 2021, the Awutu Senya East Municipality had a total population of 236,527, comprising 115,530 males and 120,997 females. The municipality is predominantly urban, with 229,701 residents in urban areas and only 6,826 in rural areas. Health services in the municipality are provided by both government and private institutions, with a total of 47 health facilities as of December 2020. These include 30 government-operated facilities (Polyclinics, Health Centres and CHPS) and 17 private health facilities (hospitals, maternity homes, and clinics) providing reproductive health and abortion support services [26].

According to the 2021 Population and Housing Census, the Jaman North District has a population of 117,909, with 58,623 males (49.71%) and 59,286 females (50.29%). The district’s population is distributed between 70,188 urban residents and 47,721 rural residents. Health services in the district encompass both orthodox and traditional practices, focusing on curative and preventive care. The district has 11 Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds, 3 clinics, 6 health centers, 2 private hospitals, and 33 chemical shops [27].

The study population consisted of caregivers of adolescent girls (aged 15–19 years). Caregivers included parents, guardians, or any adult responsible for the adolescent girl’s welfare.

The sample size for this study was determined using Cochran’s sample size formula, facilitated by an online calculator. The estimated proportion of caregivers willing to support contraceptive use was set at 31.7% from a previous study [18]. Using this proportion, a sample size of 333 was calculated. To account for potential non-responses, an additional 10% (approximately 33 respondents) was added, bringing the total sample size to 366 participants. This final sample size is deemed sufficient to achieve the study’s objectives.

Step 1: Determine the total population in both districts.

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of the population for each district.

Step 3: Allocate the total sample size proportionally.

Awutu Senya East District (urban): 244 participants.

This study utilized a multistage sampling method to ensure a systematic and representative selection of participants. Ghana is divided administratively into 16 regions. The first stage involved cluster sampling, during which regions were selected at random. The Central region and Bono region were selected in this process.

In the second stage, we employed stratified sampling within selected regions to categorize districts into urban and rural strata. A random selection from the Central Region resulted in the Awutu Senya East District. A rural district was randomly selected from the Bono Region, resulting in the selection of Jaman North District.

The third stage entailed the random selection of communities within each district to ensure varied participation of caregivers from various communities. In the fourth stage, households in these communities were selected at random. In each selected community, systematic random sampling was applied to identify households. The process began at a well-known landmark, such as the main market in the community. Researchers started from the market and moved in a pre-determined direction, selecting every nth household. Researchers then moved in a designated direction, selecting every 10th household in a community selected in Jaman North and every 20th household in a community selected in Awutu Senya East until the sample size was reached. The first household was randomly chosen near the market. If a selected household did not have an eligible participant, the next available household was selected.

Participants must be primary caregivers (e.g., parents, guardians) of adolescent girls aged 10–19 years residing in Jaman North (rural) or Awutu Senya East District (urban). Also, participants must have lived in the selected district for at least one year to ensure familiarity with the local context. Finally, participants must be willing to provide informed consent to participate in the study and respond to the survey questions.

Individuals who are not primary caregivers of adolescent girls will be excluded from the study. Individuals who met the inclusion criteira but were not present at the time of the study. Caregivers who have lived in the district for less than one year will be excluded to avoid bias due to lack of long-term exposure to the local environment. In addition, individuals who are unable to provide informed consent, due to cognitive impairments or other reasons, will be excluded from the study.

Data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included sections on demographics, knowledge of contraceptive methods, attitudes towards adolescent contraceptive use, willingness to support contraceptive use, and reasons for their stance. The knowledge level of caregivers regarding contraceptive methods was assessed through questions on their understanding of different contraceptive methods, their uses, the frequency and correct usage, and the ideal time for use. Correct response to each question was assigned a score of 1, whilst 0 was given to an incorrect response.

The attitude of caregivers toward adolescent contraceptive use was evaluated by exploring key attitude elements, including their opinions on adolescent contraceptive use, beliefs about contraceptives preventing pregnancy, and perceptions of contraceptives promoting promiscuity. Caregivers were also asked about their willingness to discuss contraceptive options with adolescents and their comfort level in discussing contraceptive issues with their adolescent daughters. Scores were assigned to these responses, and total and median scores were computed.

In all, several factors were used to evaluate caregivers’ attitudes towards adolescent contraception use. These comprised their views on teenage contraceptive use, trust on the efficacy of contraceptives in preventing pregnancy, and perceptions about whether using contraceptives fuels promiscuity. Additionally, their willingness to talking about contraceptive choices with teenagers and their comfort level addressing contraceptive concerns with their daughters were computed. Every answer was graded; mean and total scores were computed. Then attitudes were categorised as either negative or positive, with scores below the mean regarded as negative and scores equal to or above the mean seen as positive.

The attitudes of caregivers regarding adolescent contraceptive use were evaluated using a scoring system. Scores were classified according to the median, with scores below the median indicating negative attitudes and scores at or above the median reflecting positive attitudes towards adolescent contraceptive use. This median-based categorization facilitated a clear dichotomous comparison of caregivers positive and negative perspectives on contraceptive use among adolescents.

Data was analyzed using STATA version 17 software. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. Independent and dependent variables were summarized and presented in frequency distribution tables and charts. A modified Poisson regression model was fitted on the data to determine the factors associated with the caregivers’ support for adolescent contraceptive use. This model is appropriate when the prevalence of the attribute of interest in the outcome variable is common (> 10%). In this scenario, the model offers accurate estimates of the risk ratios and so is preferred to logistic regression model [28] The study found 68% of Caregivers willing to support adolescent contraceptive use, which is high and far exceeds the desired prevalence for good estimation of odds ratios in a logistic regression model. Thus, logistic regression overestimates odds when the outcome is not rare. Statistical significance was established atp< 0.05 the modified Poisson regression model.

Scores were assigned to knowledge-related questions to determine the overall knowledge level of caregivers regarding family planning methods, with a total score of 10. This was determined by summing the scores of each respondent in the ten knowledge items to obtain a composite knowledge score. Caregivers whose total scores were equivalent or greater than the mean score (7) were classified as having good knowledge, while those with aggregate scores below the mean value were categorized as poor knowledge [29].

Similarly, caregivers’ attitudes toward adolescent family planning use was assessed by assigning scores to attitude-related questions. The total attitude score was 7, with a median score of 4. Caregivers who scored below the median (≤ 4.0) were classified as having a negative attitude, while those who scored 4 or higher were considered to have a positive attitude [29].

Additionally, caregivers’ support for contraceptive use was evaluated using support-related questions, with a total score of 9. The mean score was used in determining Caregiver’s level of support. Caregivers who scored below the mean mark (6) were considered unwilling to support adolescent contraceptive use, whereas those whose scores were equal to, or above the mean were classified as willing to support the practice.

A total of 366 participants were included in the study. Of the respondents, 44.5% were aged between 40 and 49 years, and the majority (78.7%) were females. In terms of marital status, 66.4% of caregivers were married. Regarding educational attainment, 30.6% had completed secondary education, 30.1% had achieved tertiary education, and 15.8% had no formal education. Occupationally, 51.9% of caregivers were self-employed, whereas 24.6% were unemployed. The religious distribution showed that 78.4% were identified as Christians, with 20.5% adhering to Islam. A significant proportion (66.7%) resided in urban areas. In terms of income, 30.6% of caregivers earned more than GHC1,500 monthly, while 22.7% reported no income (Table1).

In all, 68% of respondents indicated that they were willing to support contraceptive usage among adolescents, while 32% opposed it (Fig.1).

According to the results, 76.2% of respondents expressed a willingness to support contraceptive use among adolescents, and 77.9% believed that adolescents should have access to contraceptives. Furthermore, 67.2% of caregivers indicated they would be willing to purchase contraceptives for adolescent girls, and 84.4% would actively participate in decision-making regarding contraceptive use. Additionally, 85.5% of caregivers reported they would not discourage adolescents from using contraceptives, and 58.7% would refrain from reprimanding adolescent girls for possessing contraceptives (Table2).

In comparing the willingness of caregivers in rural and urban settings, the findings show that in the rural district, 23.8% of caregivers were unwilling to support contraceptive use, while 76.2% were willing to support the practice. In contrast, in the urban setting, 36.5% of caregivers expressed unwillingness to support contraceptive use, whereas 63.5% were willing to offer their support (Fig.2). The chi-square test of independence results in Table3shows that there is a statistically significant link between the level of support caregivers receive and where they live (χ² = 6.009,p= 0.014).

The data indicate that 13.9% of respondents would not support the practice, while 19.7% were undecided. Additionally, 8.7% of caregivers indicated they would offer marginal support, 42.9% reported being supportive, and 14.8% expressed that they would be very supportive (Fig.3).

The data revealed that 96.4% of respondents were aware of at least one contraceptive method. 96.7% of those who answered said that contraceptives are used to stop pregnancy, 57.1% said that they help prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 4.9% said they thought they could be used to end a pregnancy, and 55.5% said they knew they could be used to limit the size of a family (Table4).

According to the findings on the knowledge on of the appropriate use of contraceptives, 58.6% of the respondents recognized condoms as effective when used correctly. Furthermore, 80.6% of respondents understood the importance of administering injectable contraceptives at intervals of either one month or three months. In terms of implants, 79.5% of caregivers identified them as providing protection for three or five years. Furthermore, 64.5% indicated that emergency contraceptives should be used immediately following unprotected intercourse. In addition, 65.9% of caregivers understood that they should take oral contraceptives once daily (Table5).

To assess the knowledge level of respondents, the results indicate that 29.0% of caregivers demonstrated a poor level of knowledge, while 71.0% exhibited a good level of knowledge (Fig.4).

The data indicate that 9.8% of caregivers are opposed to contraceptive use, with 7.7% strongly against the practice. Conversely, 45.1% of respondents support contraceptive use, and 13.9% strongly support it. Furthermore, 92.9% of caregivers agree that contraceptives can prevent pregnancy, while 61.7% believe they encourage promiscuity among adolescent girls. The table also shows that 73.5% of caregivers would be willing to discuss contraceptive options with adolescent girls, and 48.6% feel very comfortable discussing sexual health, including contraceptives, with adolescents (Table6).

Overall, the data shows that 30% of respondents held a negative attitude towards the use of contraceptives, while 70% expressed a positive attitude towards the practice (Fig.5).

The findings indicate that gender, residential setting, and income are statistically significant predictors of caregivers’ willingness to support contraceptive use among adolescent girls. Caregivers aged 60–69 years were 71% more likely to support contraceptive use compared to those below 40 years of age (Adjusted IRR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.08–2.71). Male caregivers had a 28% reduced likelihood of supporting their female counterparts (Adjusted IRR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58–0.89). Similarly, caregivers residing in rural areas were 47% more likely to support contraceptive use compared to those living in urban settings (Adjusted IRR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.21–1.79). Additionally, caregivers earning at least GH500 had a higher likelihood of supporting contraceptive use among adolescent girls. Other variables in the model did not show a statistically significant association with caregivers’ willingness to support contraceptive use (Table7a).

The results indicate that caregivers whose cultural beliefs oppose contraceptive use were 27% more likely to support adolescent girls’ contraceptive use (Adjusted IRR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.10–1.48). However, caregivers’ religious beliefs and social status against contraceptive use were not found to have a statistically significant association with their willingness to support adolescent contraceptive use (Table7b).

According to the study, caregivers in both urban and rural areas are willing to support their daughters’ use of birth control for four main reasons: to avoid pregnancy (92.0%), to protect them from STDs (67.6%), to improve their health (36.8%), and to give them more power (29.9%) (Fig.6).

The reasons caregivers are reluctant to support contraceptive use among adolescent girls include fear of encouraging sexual activity (66.7%), fear of infertility (44.0%), conflicts with religious beliefs (43.2%), concerns about side effects (42.6%), conflicts with cultural beliefs (38.5%), lack of knowledge about family planning (32.5%), and social status (24.3%) (Fig.7).

This study examines the willingness of caregivers in urban and rural Ghana to support contraceptive use among adolescent girls. Additionally, it explored the factors shaping caregiver support or opposition to contraceptive use in Jaman North and Awutu Senya East, revealing that 68% of caregivers overall were willing to support adolescent contraceptive use. This finding is consistent with Narasimhan, Thornburg, & Sales (2024) [30], who reported a 62% support level and is further contextualized by a higher support level found in Cleveland, Ohio (94.4%) [31], and among Mexican Catholic parents, who generally endorsed adolescent access to contraception [32]. However, these results contrast sharply with a Nigerian study where only 31.7% of caregivers supported contraceptive use among unmarried adolescents, highlighting potential cultural and societal influences on caregiver attitudes [18]. Such disparities underline the importance of cultural and contextual factors, as noted by a similar study [30], where variations in parental attitudes toward adolescent reproductive health are influenced by socio-cultural norms.

Lack of caregiver support for contraceptive usage among female teenagers raises the likelihood of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and STIs, therefore it endangers their health and well-being. In addition to perpetuating poverty and gender disparities, this issue can lead to school dropouts, limited employment opportunities, and financial difficulties. Furthermore, it contributes to explaining high rates of teenage fertility, maternal and infant death, and the growing burden on healthcare systems. Encouragement of teenage contraception usage may assist in interrupting these patterns and advancing more empowered, healthy young women.

This study revealed a notable disparity between urban and rural caregivers regarding support for adolescent contraceptive use, with rural caregivers exhibiting greater support than those in urban areas. This is consistent with a previous study [33], indicating that rural adolescents are more likely to use contraception due to greater caregiver support. This trend may be attributed to rural caregivers prioritizing family planning to mitigate the socio-economic challenges associated with adolescent pregnancies, such as financial hardship, school dropout, and limited access to healthcare. In contrast, urban caregivers, who are exposed to a wider range of reproductive health perspectives, may adopt a more cautious approach, often influenced by concerns that contraception could encourage early sexual activity. Rural caregivers may also perceive contraceptive use as essential due to limited healthcare access, a view supported by findings from Lesotho [34]. This suggests that while urban caregivers might have access to a broader mix of influences, rural caregivers may be more pragmatic in their support of contraception, aiming to address the health needs of adolescents in settings with fewer healthcare resources.

Knowledge and awareness of contraceptives have been identified as a key factor in contraceptive use [35,36]. While most caregivers were aware of at least one contraceptive method, approximately half of caregivers had a comprehensive understanding of contraceptives, a pattern previously observed in Nigeria [18]. Other studies [37,38], further indicate that urban caregivers tend to have more in-depth contraceptive knowledge due to higher educational attainment and better access to health information. In categorizing knowledge levels in a similar study [39], a small proportion of participants had good knowledge of contraceptives, while the majority had poor knowledge, reflecting the limited understanding observed in the current study. This limited contraceptive knowledge, especially in rural settings, emphasizes the need for targeted educational interventions to bridge awareness gaps and provide caregivers with reliable contraceptive information.

Caregivers’ attitudes toward adolescents’ contraceptive use are critical for advancing reproductive health, as highlighted in this study and supported by existing literature. The findings revealed diverse attitudes, with 70% of respondents expressing positive views, recognizing contraceptives as effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies and promoting adolescent health. However, the split between good and poor attitudes suggests that cultural norms significantly shape caregivers’ perceptions, consistent with a similar study [39]. This finding resonates with the concerns expressed by caregivers in other studies [27,40,41] which also report positive attitudes toward contraception. These findings, however, contrast with a study conducted in Nigeria [18], which indicated a considerably lower level of positive attitudes among caregivers, thereby underscoring significant regional disparities. This variation highlights the significant impact of socio-cultural factors on caregivers’ acceptance of adolescent contraceptive use. Even though most people agree that contraceptives are good, research [32] shows that parents may not want to let teens use them alone because they don’t want to teach them how to make reproductive decisions too early. This finding resonates with the concerns expressed by caregivers in this study.

Interestingly, rural caregivers displayed comparatively more positive attitudes, which may reflect a practical response to the heightened risks of unintended pregnancies in rural communities, as noted in a previous study [42]. Rural settings often face limited healthcare access and more pronounced socio-economic challenges, which could explain the more pragmatic stance toward contraceptive use.

Caregivers’ attitudes are shaped by cultural norms, including beliefs linking contraception to promiscuity and religious opposition to its use among unmarried adolescents. Regional differences in healthcare access, education, and economic challenges also play a role, with rural caregivers prioritizing contraception to prevent adolescent pregnancies, while urban caregivers remain more cautious due to diverse social influences. These findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions and targeted education to address misconceptions and promote adolescent reproductive health.

In assessing the factors associated with caregivers’ willingness, this study highlighted several socio-demographic factors associated with caregiver willingness to support adolescent contraceptive use, including gender, residential setting, and income. Female caregivers were more likely than male caregivers to support adolescent contraception, consistent with Ehiaghe & Barrow (2022) [18], who noted that female caregivers are generally more receptive to adolescent reproductive needs. Furthermore, caregivers residing in rural areas expressed greater support, potentially due to the heightened focus on preventing adolescent pregnancies in resource-limited environments. Financial stability was another important factor. Caregivers who made at least GHC500 showed more support, which suggests a link between financial stability and being open to reproductive health practices [43].

Interestingly, caregivers with traditionally conservative cultural beliefs showed a surprising openness to adolescent contraceptive use, indicating a potential cultural shift. Küng et al. (2021) [32] observed a similar trend among Mexican Catholic parents, where cultural and religious beliefs influenced support for adolescent contraception. In rural areas, traditional norms may even foster discussions on contraceptive use, resulting in higher acceptance [44]. Although cultural and religious values are influential, religious beliefs and social status in the current study were not predictors of willingness, indicating that caregivers may prioritize pragmatic considerations such as health outcomes and social implications over tradition as seen in recent studies [21].

Supportive parents gave many reasons for encouraging teen girls to use birth control, including avoiding unintended pregnancies, lowering the risk of STIs, and giving girls more power. This shows that they see birth control as a way to protect teens’ health and improve society. In a related study in Malawi, parents expressed similar motivations, noting that family planning helps prevent pregnancy-related complications, supports healthy child spacing, and reduces risks from HIV and STDs [45]. These shared parental motivations emphasize the value of family planning in advancing adolescent health, autonomy, and well-being, particularly in contexts where health risks are compounded by limited healthcare access.

Conversely, caregivers opposed to adolescent contraceptive use cited fears of promoting promiscuity, infertility, and cultural or religious objections, consistent with broader literature that identifies these concerns as significant barriers to parental support [20,21,46]. A few caregivers even recognized their role in advocating for youth family planning while acknowledging a general parental reluctance to support it.

This study highlights the relationship between socio-cultural, economic, and educational factors shaping caregivers’ support for adolescent contraceptive use in urban and rural Ghana. The findings reveal that rural caregivers tend to be more accepting, while urban caregivers express greater caution due to social influences. Limited contraceptive knowledge, persistent misconceptions, and concerns about promiscuity remain significant barriers. However, financial stability and evolving cultural attitudes appear to increase caregiver support. These insights underscore the need for context-specific approaches to improve adolescent reproductive health, emphasizing the importance of addressing knowledge gaps and societal perceptions.

Education programs centered on the community must be developed to improve caregivers’ knowledge of adolescent contraception, ensuring that the information provided is accurate, culturally relevant, and consistent with local beliefs. Engaging religious and traditional leaders through dialogues and advocacy training can effectively address cultural misconceptions, shift societal norms, and encourage caregivers to adopt supportive attitudes. Given that female caregivers demonstrate increased support for contraception, it is essential to implement targeted interventions that empower them as advocates within their families and communities, utilizing peer-support networks and leadership programs.

Policy makers should implement policies that enhance the affordability of contraceptives, particularly for low-income households, to mitigate economic barriers. Subsidized birth control services, community-based birth control distribution, and financial support systems can help people who are struggling with money and encourage caregivers to support the reproductive health of teens.

Furthermore, incorporating family planning education into adolescent health initiatives within schools, community centers, and youth-friendly clinics will address misinformation, especially in rural regions where access to reproductive health services is restricted. All interventions and policies must be context-specific, taking into account the socio-cultural and economic realities of the study sites. Engaging caregivers and key stakeholders in the design and implementation of these programs will ensure their practicality, acceptability, and sustainability. Aligning strategies with local needs and available resources can effectively enhance caregivers’ support for adolescent contraceptive use and improve reproductive health outcomes.

Although this study offers informative analysis of caregivers’ factors influencing teenage contraceptive use, some limitations have to be acknowledged.

First, a geographical focus on Jaman North and Awutu Senya East districts limits the generalizability of findings to other areas of Ghana as socio-cultural, economic, and healthcare access differences may affect teenage reproductive health behaviours differently all throughout the country.

Second, the unequal sample sizes between urban and rural populations could have brought sampling bias, therefore impacting the comparability of findings. The under representation of rural perspectives could limit an ability of the study to entirely determine contextual variations in caregiver adolescent communication.

Third, an obvious gap exists in the study since it depends on quantitative techniques without thorough qualitative investigation. Including focus groups or interviews would have given more detailed understanding of caregiver’s cultural standards, decision-making practices, and barriers affecting teenage contraceptive use.

By means of wide geographic sample and mixed-methodologies, addressing these constraints would improve the robustness and policy relevance of next studies in this subject.
