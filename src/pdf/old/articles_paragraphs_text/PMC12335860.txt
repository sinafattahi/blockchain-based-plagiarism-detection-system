Preeclampsia (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, with systemic inflammation playing a central role in its pathogenesis. Despite extensive research on inflammatory biomarkers, inconsistencies persist regarding their associations with disease severity and onset. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence on the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and PE, focusing on their diagnostic and prognostic potential. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL) to identify observational studies investigating inflammatory biomarkers in PE. Eligible studies included case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort designs with normotensive controls. Data extraction covered study characteristics, biomarker profiles, and clinical outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In total, 13 studies were included, predominantly from diverse geographical regions. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein) were consistently elevated in PE, with distinct profiles for early-onset (placental-driven inflammation) and late-onset (systemic inflammation) subtypes. Biomarkers such as neopterin and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor showed promise in stratifying disease severity. Maternal-fetal inflammatory cascades were evident, with correlations between maternal biomarkers and adverse neonatal outcomes. However, heterogeneity in study designs, biomarker measurement timing, and inconsistent adjustments for confounders limited comparability. Quality assessment revealed seven low-risk and six moderate-risk studies, with no high-risk bias. Inflammatory biomarkers demonstrate significant associations with PE severity and onset, supporting their role in disease monitoring and risk stratification. However, methodological inconsistencies highlight the need for standardized protocols and larger, longitudinal studies to validate their clinical utility. Future research should integrate multi-omics approaches to refine biomarker panels and elucidate causal pathways, ultimately guiding targeted interventions.

Preeclampsia (PE) remains one of the most significant obstetric complications worldwide, affecting approximately 5-10% of pregnancies and contributing substantially to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality [1]. This multisystem disorder, characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, represents not merely a pregnancy-specific condition but rather a complex syndrome with diverse pathophysiological pathways [2]. Among these pathways, the role of systemic inflammation has emerged as a central focus in contemporary research, with growing evidence suggesting that inflammatory processes may serve as both mediators and markers of disease progression [3]. The physiological adaptations of normal pregnancy already involve a state of controlled inflammation, but in PE, this balance appears disrupted, leading to excessive systemic inflammatory responses that contribute to endothelial dysfunction and the characteristic clinical manifestations of the disorder [4].

The investigation of inflammatory biomarkers in PE has gained considerable momentum in recent years, driven by the need for better predictive tools and a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms [5]. Cytokines, acute-phase proteins, and other mediators of inflammation have been extensively studied in this context, with particular attention to their potential roles in differentiating disease subtypes and predicting clinical outcomes. Interleukins (ILs) such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), along with C-reactive protein (CRP) and various adhesion molecules, have shown promise in reflecting the inflammatory milieu associated with PE [6]. However, the existing literature presents considerable heterogeneity in findings, with variations in biomarker profiles observed across different study populations, gestational ages, and disease severities [7]. This inconsistency may stem from methodological differences, including variations in sample timing, assay techniques, and case definitions, as well as the inherent biological complexity of the condition itself.

The relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and PE severity represents a particularly important area of investigation [5,8]. Emerging evidence suggests that distinct inflammatory signatures may characterize different clinical presentations of the disease, from early-onset severe forms to late-onset mild cases [9]. The potential to stratify patients based on biomarker profiles could have significant clinical implications, enabling more targeted monitoring and intervention strategies [10]. Furthermore, understanding these inflammatory patterns may provide insights into the underlying pathophysiological differences between PE subtypes, which currently remain incompletely understood. The temporal aspects of biomarker expression also warrant careful consideration, as the inflammatory cascade in PE likely evolves throughout the course of the disease, with different mediators becoming prominent at various stages of disease progression [11].

Despite numerous studies examining inflammatory markers in PE [5-7,11], there remains a need for a comprehensive synthesis of this evidence. Previous systematic reviews have often focused on specific biomarkers or limited aspects of the inflammatory response, leaving gaps in our understanding of how these markers collectively relate to disease characteristics. Moreover, the quality and methodological rigor of existing studies vary considerably, necessitating careful evaluation of potential biases and limitations in the evidence base. This systematic review addresses these needs by comprehensively examining the association between inflammatory biomarkers and PE severity and onset, while critically appraising the methodological quality of included studies.

This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency [12]. The objective was to synthesize existing evidence on the association between inflammatory biomarkers and the severity or onset of PE.

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: they were observational in design (case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort studies) and investigated inflammatory biomarkers in relation to PE; they reported on biomarker levels in connection with PE severity (such as mild versus severe or early-onset versus late-onset) or onset; they included a control group (either normotensive pregnant women or non-pregnant controls); and they were published as full-text articles in English. Excluded from the review were studies such as review articles, editorials, conference abstracts, animal studies, and those that did not measure biomarkers relevant to inflammation.

A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted across the following five major electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL, covering literature from their inception up to June 5, 2025. The search strategy incorporated a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free-text keywords to capture all relevant studies. Key terms included variations of “preeclampsia,” “pre-eclampsia,” “gestational hypertension,” and “toxemia” for the condition, alongside terms like “inflammation,” “inflammatory markers,” “cytokines,” “interleukins,” “TNF-alpha,” and “CRP” for the biomarkers. The search strategy for each database is included in the Appendices. No restrictions were placed on publication dates or study designs to ensure a broad and inclusive search; however, the studies included in this review were published between 2010 and 2025.

The study selection process adhered to the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram to ensure transparency and reproducibility. After removing duplicate records, two independent reviewers (HSBA and EMAA, both authors of this review) screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining studies to assess their relevance. Full-text articles of potentially eligible studies were then retrieved and evaluated against the predefined inclusion criteria. Any disagreements between the reviewers during the screening process were resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by consulting a third author (RBHY) who acted as a tiebreaker. Detailed reasons for excluding studies at the full-text stage were documented to maintain clarity and accountability in the selection process.

A standardized data extraction form was developed to systematically collect key information from each included study. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics such as the first author, publication year, country, study design, and sample size. Population details, including the criteria used to define PE, gestational age, and severity classification, were also recorded. Biomarker-related data encompassed the types of biomarkers measured, the timing of their measurement, and the assay methods employed. Key findings, such as associations between biomarkers and PE severity or onset, along with relevant effect estimates and their statistical significance, were extracted. Discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through consensus to ensure accuracy.

The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), a validated tool for assessing the risk of bias in observational studies [13]. The NOS evaluates three critical domains, namely, selection, comparability, and outcome. The selection domain assesses the representativeness of cases, the selection of controls, and the ascertainment of exposure. The comparability domain examines whether the studies controlled for confounding factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), and gestational age. The outcome domain evaluates the assessment of outcomes and the adequacy of follow-up. Each study was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a lower risk of bias. Studies were categorized as low (7-9 stars), moderate (5-6 stars), or high risk (<5 stars) based on their scores. Two reviewers independently conducted the quality assessments, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion to ensure consistency.

Given the substantial heterogeneity observed across the included studies, ranging from variations in study designs and biomarker measurement methods to differences in outcome definitions, a meta-analysis was not performed. The primary reasons for this decision were clinical heterogeneity, methodological diversity, and incomplete reporting of effect estimates in some studies. Clinical heterogeneity arose from differing definitions of PE and inconsistent biomarker measurement protocols, making it challenging to pool data meaningfully. Methodological diversity, such as variations in study designs and the extent of adjustment for confounders, further complicated the comparability of results. Additionally, some studies lacked detailed statistical measures necessary for meta-analysis, such as confidence intervals or standard deviations.

A narrative approach was employed to summarize and interpret the findings. This approach allowed for the organization of results by biomarker type, such as cytokines, acute-phase proteins, and oxidative stress markers, and their associations with PE severity or onset. Tables and descriptive summaries were used to compare and contrast findings across studies, highlighting consistencies, discrepancies, and gaps in the evidence. This method provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge while acknowledging the limitations imposed by the heterogeneity of the included studies.

As this systematic review involved the analysis of previously published data, ethical approval was not required. However, it was ensured that all original studies included in the review had obtained the necessary ethical clearances for their research. This adherence to ethical standards underscores the integrity and reliability of the synthesized evidence.

The systematic search across five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL) initially identified 370 records. After removing 193 duplicate records, 177 studies underwent title screening, of which 129 were excluded for irrelevance. The remaining 48 full-text articles were sought for retrieval, but 23 could not be obtained. Of the 25 reports assessed for eligibility, eight were excluded as review articles or editorial commentaries, and four did not assess biomarkers in PE, leaving 13 studies [14-26] for final inclusion in the systematic review (Figure1).

The systematic review included 13 observational studies [14-26] investigating the association between inflammatory biomarkers and the severity or onset of PE. The studies were conducted across diverse geographical regions, including China [14,21], Turkey [15,18,22,23], Mexico [16], the United States [17], Brazil [19,20], Portugal [24], New Zealand [25], and Hungary [26]. Study designs varied, encompassing case-control, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies, with sample sizes ranging from 80 to 466 participants. The study populations predominantly consisted of pregnant women, with cases of PE compared to normotensive controls. Biomarkers assessed included pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8), anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)), acute-phase proteins (e.g., CRP), and oxidative stress markers (e.g., malondialdehyde (MDA), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)). Timing of biomarker measurement varied, with some studies collecting samples during pregnancy and others at delivery (Table1).

Several studies reported significant associations between inflammatory biomarkers and the risk of PE. Liu et al. [14] found that higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII) scores correlated with elevated levels of IL-2, IL-4, and TGF-β, with each unit increase in E-DII raising the odds of PE by 30% (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.18-1.43). Similarly, Ferguson et al. [17] observed elevated hazard ratios for inflammation biomarkers, particularly TNF-α, which was consistently elevated across all gestational time points (HR = 1.49-1.63). Cakmak et al. [18] reported significantly higher serum levels of endocan and TNF-α in PE patients compared to controls (p < 0.001), with endocan levels correlating with disease severity, systolic blood pressure, and proteinuria.

The severity of PE was associated with distinct inflammatory profiles. Valencia-Ortega et al. [16] demonstrated that early-onset PE (EO-PE) was linked to a pro-inflammatory placental state, characterized by decreased IL-10 and increased IL-8/interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) ratios, while late-onset PE (LO-PE) exhibited systemic maternal inflammation with elevated IL-6. Ozler et al. [22] found that neopterin (NEO) levels, measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were significantly higher in mild PE (14.1 nmol/L, p = 0.013), severe PE (14.8 nmol/L, p = 0.000), and HELLP syndrome compared to controls, with levels correlating with disease severity (r = 0.533, p = 0.000). Xiao et al. [21] reported that IL-6 levels were significantly higher in EO-PE and LO-PE compared to controls, with further elevations in severe but not mild PE.

Some biomarkers demonstrated diagnostic potential for PE. Pinheiro et al. [19] identified D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as significantly elevated in severe PE, with strong diagnostic performance (area under the curve (AUC) not specified). Toldi et al. [25] reported higher levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), IL-6, and hs-CRP in PE compared to healthy pregnancies (suPAR: 3.18 vs. 2.02 ng/mL, p = 0.0001; IL-6: 5.99 vs. 1.41 pg/mL, p = 0.0001). Szarka et al. [26] highlighted a pro-inflammatory systemic environment in PE, with elevated levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, and adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)), which correlated with clinical markers of disease severity (Table2).

Studies also explored maternal-fetal inflammatory dynamics. Catarino et al. [24] found higher maternal levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP in PE, alongside elevated oxidative stress markers (e.g., TBARS). These disturbances were mirrored in newborns of PE mothers, who exhibited higher uric acid and CRP levels, suggesting a shared inflammatory state. Similarly, Cemgil Arikan et al. [23] reported that IL-12 levels in severe PE positively correlated with fetal birth weight (p < 0.05), indicating a potential link between maternal inflammation and fetal outcomes.

Not all studies reported consistent associations. Kara et al. [15] found no significant elevation in hs-CRP, sialic acid, or IL-6 in PE or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) compared to controls (p > 0.05), suggesting a possible role for local rather than systemic inflammation. Silva et al. [20] observed no difference in MDA levels between PE and controls but reported higher IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in PE, indicating immune dysfunction without oxidative stress involvement.

Seven studies demonstrated low risk of bias [14,16,17,21,24-26], scoring 7-9 stars due to robust study designs, representative samples, and adequate adjustment for confounders. The remaining six studies [15,18-20,22,23] were rated as moderate risk (5-6 stars), primarily due to limitations such as insufficient control for confounding variables, small sample sizes, or unclear exposure assessment timing. No studies were classified as high risk. While the majority of findings were supported by methodologically sound research, the moderate-risk studies warrant cautious interpretation, particularly where key covariates such as BMI or gestational age were unaccounted for [15,22] or where biomarker measurement timing was inconsistent [19,20]. Overall, the evidence base remains largely reliable, though heterogeneity in study quality underscores the need for standardized methodologies in future research (Table3).

The findings of this systematic review underscore the significant role of inflammatory biomarkers in the pathogenesis, severity, and onset of PE, while also highlighting inconsistencies and methodological variations across studies. The synthesis of 13 observational studies reveals a complex interplay between systemic and localized inflammatory responses, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, which collectively contribute to the clinical manifestations of PE. The majority of included studies [14,17,21,26] consistently reported elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, in women with PE compared to normotensive controls. These findings align with existing literature that characterizes PE as a pro-inflammatory state, where aberrant placental development and immune dysregulation trigger systemic endothelial damage [27,28]. For instance, the repeated measures design by Ferguson et al. [17] demonstrated that TNF-α remained elevated throughout gestation in PE women, suggesting sustained inflammation as a hallmark of the disease. This is further supported by Szarka et al. [26], who identified a broader cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, including elevated IP-10 and MCP-1, which are known to exacerbate endothelial dysfunction [29].

The association between inflammatory biomarkers and PE severity was particularly evident in studies stratifying cases by onset (early vs. late) or clinical severity (mild vs. severe). Valencia-Ortega et al. [16] reported distinct inflammatory profiles for EO-PE and LO-PE, with EO-PE characterized by placental pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., decreased IL-10, elevated IL-8/IL-1RA ratios) and LO-PE associated with systemic maternal inflammation (e.g., higher IL-6). These findings corroborate the "two-stage model" of PE, where EO-PE arises from placental malperfusion and LO-PE reflects maternal systemic dysfunction [30]. Similarly, Ozler et al. [22] identified NEO as a biomarker correlating with disease severity, with levels highest in HELLP syndrome, suggesting its potential utility in risk stratification. This aligns with prior work by Verlohren et al. [31], who proposed that biomarkers such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) could differentiate PE subtypes. However, the inconsistent performance of some biomarkers, such as hs-CRP and IL-6 in Kara et al. [15], challenges the universality of systemic inflammation in PE and points to the role of localized placental inflammation, as hypothesized by Harmon et al. [32].

The diagnostic potential of inflammatory biomarkers was explored in several studies, with mixed results. Pinheiro et al. [19] and Toldi et al. [25] reported strong discriminative performance for D-dimer, PAI-1, and suPAR, respectively, in identifying severe PE. These findings are promising but must be contextualized within the limitations of single-center studies and variability in assay methods. For example, while suPAR demonstrated a narrow range in healthy pregnancies [25], its clinical utility as a standalone marker remains uncertain without validation in larger, diverse cohorts. Similarly, the correlation between endocan and disease severity [18] introduces a novel biomarker linked to endothelial dysfunction, yet its pathophysiological role warrants further investigation. Comparatively, existing literature emphasizes multi-marker panels (e.g., combining sFlt-1, PlGF, and soluble endoglin) for improved PE prediction [33], suggesting that future research should explore integrative models incorporating inflammatory and angiogenic markers.

Maternal-fetal inflammatory responses were another critical theme, with Catarino et al. [24] and Cemgil Arikan et al. [23] demonstrating that maternal inflammation extends to the fetal compartment, as evidenced by elevated uric acid and CRP in neonates of PE mothers. This mirrors earlier findings by Mulla et al. [34], who reported fetal immune activation in PE, potentially predisposing offspring to long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risks [35]. The positive correlation between IL-12 and fetal birth weight in severe PE [23] further suggests that cytokine profiles may modulate fetal growth, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. These observations reinforce the concept of PE as a multisystem disorder with intergenerational implications, as highlighted by Roberts and Hubel [36].

Despite these advances, inconsistencies in biomarker associations warrant caution. For instance, Kara et al. [15] found no significant differences in hs-CRP or IL-6 between PE and controls, contradicting the meta-analysis by Lau et al. [37], which reported CRP as a reliable inflammatory marker in PE. Similarly, Silva et al. [20] observed no oxidative stress (MDA) differences but noted immune dysregulation (elevated IL-6/IL-10 ratio), underscoring the heterogeneity of PE phenotypes. Such discrepancies may arise from variations in study design, sample timing, or population characteristics (e.g., BMI, ethnicity), as noted in the LIFECODES cohort [17], where biomarker associations were attenuated in high-risk subgroups. This heterogeneity echoes the call by Stepan et al. [38] for standardized protocols in PE biomarker research to enhance comparability.

This review has several limitations. First, the predominance of observational designs precludes causal inferences, and residual confounding (e.g., unmeasured sociodemographic or genetic factors) may bias associations. Second, heterogeneity in biomarker measurement timing (e.g., trimester-specific vs. delivery samples) complicates cross-study comparisons, as highlighted by the variability in IL-6 findings [21,22]. Third, the exclusion of non-English studies and gray literature may introduce selection bias. Finally, the moderate risk of bias in six studies [15,19] due to inadequate confounder adjustment or small samples necessitates cautious interpretation.

This review consolidates robust evidence linking inflammatory biomarkers to PE pathogenesis, severity, and onset, while also revealing critical knowledge gaps. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α), endothelial markers (e.g., endocan, suPAR), and oxidative stress mediators collectively underscore PE’s systemic inflammatory nature. However, inconsistent findings and methodological disparities highlight the need for larger, standardized studies integrating multi-omics approaches to refine biomarker panels for early prediction and personalized management. Future research should prioritize longitudinal designs, diverse populations, and mechanistic studies to unravel the causal pathways underlying inflammation in PE, ultimately informing targeted therapeutic strategies.
