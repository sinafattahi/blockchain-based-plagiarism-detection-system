Zoysia sinicais a perennial grass that thrives in intertidal zones, even under extreme waterlogging stress. In this study, we present a high‐quality chromosome‐level genome assembly ofZ. sinica, with a total size of 312.67 Mb. Through genome annotation, we identified 29,551 protein‐coding genes in theZ. sinicagenome and re‐annotated 32,925, 53,226, and 53,656 genes in the previously reportedZoysiagenomes:Zoysia japonica,Zoysia matrella, andZoysia pacifica, respectively. Genome divergence analysis indicated that theZoysiaspecies diverged relatively recently, approximately 3.63 million years ago. Comparative genomic analysis revealed an expansion of ethylene response factors and identifiedZ. sinica‐specific genes related to the response to auxin and ethylene. Transcriptome data from intertidal environments with different levels of waterlogging showed significant upregulation of nitrate transporters (NRT2.2andNRT2.4) in roots and genes involved in suberin biosynthesis in shoots. Additionally, various transporters were responsive to the intertidal environment. Our study provides insights into the intertidal adaptation ofZoysiaspecies and offers a foundation for the development of stress‐tolerant cultivars.

This study presents the first chromosome‐level genome assembly ofZoysia sinicausing Oxford Nanopore long reads and Omni‐C data, which provides a foundational genomic resource.

We provided a re‐annotation of genomes forZoysia japonica,Zoysia matrella, andZoysia pacifica, enhancing gene annotation accuracy and comparative analyses.

Our findings offer insights into intertidal adaptation ofZ. sinica, highlighting genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, ethylene response, and suberin biosynthesis under waterlogging stress.

Zoysia sinicaHance is a warm‐season turfgrass belonging to the genusZoysia(Zoysiaspp. Willd.).Zoysiaspecies are perennial grasses that are commonly used in golf courses, gardens, and parks, owing to their horticultural value. Therefore,Zoysiaspp. have been a major target of breeding due to their economically important resources. One of the major phenotypic targets of breeding inZoysiais the cold tolerance phenotypes (Guo et al.,2012; Jin et al.,2022; Wei et al.,2015). In the course of inbreeding the cold‐tolerant cultivar, intercross among the sameZoysiaspecies and the intercross among otherZoysiaspecies were both frequently utilized (Guo et al.,2012; Jin et al.,2022; Wei et al.,2015). Another phenotypic target was leaf and stolon tensile strength, which is correlated with the market value ofZoysiaspecies (Choi et al.,2017; Lulli et al.,2011).Zoysiaspecies were known to suffer from herbivorous bugs and fungus; thus, resistance to the pests was the target of breeding (Anderson et al.,2007; Obasa et al.,2012).

In nature,Zoysiaspecies are distributed along coastlines and islands (Loch et al.,2017), andZ. sinicais a salt marsh turfgrass naturally distributed in Korea and Japan. The ecological distribution ofZ. sinicaranges from mudflats that are inundated by seawater for 3 h per day to mesohaline waters consisting of soils with high salt content and little direct influence from seawater (Bang et al.,2018; J.‐S. Lee et al.,2009; S. H. Lee et al.,2018; Numata et al.,1972).Z. sinicais a species within the genusZoysiathat has adapted to waterlogged environments and is found in intertidal zones.

Although plants historically transitioned to land, recent studies have increasingly focused on their adaptations to waterlogged environments. Notably, diverse plant species in mangrove ecosystems, which thrive in coastal salt marshes and intertidal environments, have shown significant associations with ethylene response pathways and hypoxic stress response mechanisms (Liu et al.,2024; Su et al.,2022). Recently, research on the monocot mangrove speciesNypa fruticanshas reported that it maintains genomic stability over long periods through low mutation rates and a strong purifying selection (Wu et al.,2024). Key genes such as ethylene response factor VII (ERF‐VII), wound‐induced polypeptide 3 (WIP3), and UDP‐glucosyl transferase 73B3 (UGT73B3) play crucial roles in intertidal environments. Similarly, recent studies onSpartina alterniflora, a member of the Zoysieae tribe within the subfamily Chloridoideae, have demonstrated its aggressive invasion in coastal ecosystems worldwide, supported by genomic studies (S. Chen et al.,2024; Hao et al.,2024). It was reported that the gene families related to “ion transport” and “response to salt stress” have expanded and been positively selected. Such mechanisms of plant adaptation to salt and waterlogged environments are crucial for their survival in saline and waterlogged conditions. While theZoysiagenus, a well‐known halophyte with high resistance to abiotic stress, has been extensively studied for its salt tolerance (W. Wang et al.,2022; Zheng et al.,2022), research on its waterlogging response is lacking.

The chromosome number ofZoysiaspecies has been identified as 2n= 40 based on experimental evidence (Forbes,1952; Kole,2011; Loch et al.,2017). Although the chloroplast genomeZ. sinicahas been sequenced and used in phylogenetic studies (Cheon et al.,2021), a chromosomal‐level genome assembly has not yet been reported.Z. sinicawas classified as being closely related toZoysia japonica. In the genusZoysia, the genomes ofZ. japonica,Zoysia matrella, andZoysia pacificawere assembled in 2016 (Tanaka et al.,2016). TheZ. japonicagenome was assembled at the chromosomal level by scaffolding with theZ. japonica‘El Toro’ linkage map of restriction site‐associated DNA markers (F. Wang et al.,2015). Comparative genomic analyses revealed that expanded cytochrome P450 and ABA biosynthetic gene families and many duplicated genes may contribute to salt adaptation inZoysiaspecies (W. Wang et al.,2022). To understand the differences betweenZoysiaspecies, the availability of a new, high‐quality genome will allow access to novel genetic variants.

Here, we present a high‐quality chromosome‐level genome assembly and landscape transcriptomic analysis across a gradient from terrestrial areas to different degrees of tidal inundation, examining both shoot and root tissues ofZ. sinica. We analyzed the overall genomic features and gene family evolution ofZ. sinicato infer the reasons for its adaptation to the intertidal zone and examined the gene‐level responses in actual environments through transcriptome analysis. We identified that genes associated with suberin biosynthesis in the shoots ofZ. sinicaand genes related to nitrate metabolism in the roots were significantly upregulated under waterlogging environments, suggesting these as key genes for adaptation. Our findings provide insights into the various strategies involved in the adaptation of salt marsh plants and offer a foundation for breeding waterlogging stress‐tolerant turfgrass varieties.

Z. sinicawas collected from Gwangpo Bay, Sacheon, South Korea. Gwangpo Bay (35.03410° N, 127.97671° E), a geographically intertidal zone, is the largest residential area ofZ. sinicain Korea. For transcriptome research,Z. sinicawas collected from three locations with different waterlogged environments: the high intertidal zone (HIZ) and low intertidal zone (LIZ) of Gwangpo Bay, and the Forest Biomaterials Research Center, National Institute of Forest Science (Sacheon turfgrass genetic resources conservation field) as an inland (IL) site (35°6′14.54″ N, 127°58′13.45″ E), where it is maintained under the accession number ZN2289. The collected samples included shoot (comprising leaves and sheath) and root tissues to ensure comprehensive transcriptomic coverage. Immediately after collection, the samples were flash‐frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing.

This study presents the first chromosome‐level genome assembly ofZoysia sinicausing Oxford Nanopore long reads and Omni‐C data, which provides a foundational genomic resource.

We provided a re‐annotation of genomes forZoysia japonica,Zoysia matrella, andZoysia pacifica, enhancing gene annotation accuracy and comparative analyses.

Our findings offer insights into intertidal adaptation ofZ. sinica, highlighting genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, ethylene response, and suberin biosynthesis under waterlogging stress.

Genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves using Exgene Plant SV (GeneAll Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocols. To extract total RNA from the shoot and root samples, the SmartGene Plant RNA Extraction Kit was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Oxford Nanopore long‐read sequencing, we constructed a genomic DNA library using the ONT ligation sequencing kit (SQK‐LSK110) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Sequencing was performed using flow cells (R9.4.1) on a Minion sequencer. For genomic DNA sequencing, a paired‐end library with an insert size of 150 bp was constructed using the xGen DNA Library Prep EZ UNI Kit. For RNA sequencing, mRNA was enriched using the Poly(A) RNA Selection Kit (Lexogen). The enriched mRNA was then subjected to 150‐bp paired‐end library preparation using the xGen RNA Lib Prep kit (Integrated DNA Technologies). All Illumina libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.

For the preparation of Omni‐C libraries, the Dovetail Omni‐C Kit (Dovetail Genomics) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 300 mg ofZ. sinicaleaf tissue was homogenized to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. The powdered tissue was then subjected to crosslinking by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 37% and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Chromatin was then digested in situ with DNase I provided in the kit, and the resulting DNA fragments were end‐repaired, ligated, and purified. The ligated DNA was then subjected to proximity ligation to create long‐range interactions, followed by reverse crosslinking to release the DNA. The resulting DNA was purified and quantified using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified DNA was used to construct Omni‐C libraries using the Dovetail Library Module for Illumina (Dovetail Cat. No. 21004). Libraries were indexed using the Dovetail Dual Index Primer Set for Illumina (Dovetail Cat. No. 25005) and amplified according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and quantity of the libraries were assessed using Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen Ltd) and 4150 TapeStation (Agilent), respectively. Sequencing of the library was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with paired‐end 151‐bp reads.

The Illumina reads were cleaned using Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al.,2014). Thek‐mer frequency analysis and estimation of genome size were performed using jellyfish v2.3.0, with thek‐mer size option 19 (Marçais & Kingsford,2011), and Genomescope (Vurture et al.,2017), respectively, using Illumina reads. Nanopore reads were corrected for Illumina reads using LoRDEC, with thek‐mer size option 19 (Salmela & Rivals,2014). The corrected Nanopore reads were assembled into contigs using NextDeNovo v2.5.0 with options ‐k19 and ‐w19 (Hu et al.,2024). The assembled contigs were scaffolded into 20 chromosomes using the Omni‐C data, processed with Juicer v1.6 (Durand et al.,2016) and the 3D‐DNA (v180922) pipeline (https://github.com/aidenlab/3d‐dna) (Dudchenko et al.,2017). Additionally, gaps in the genome were closed using the Nanopore reads with YAGCloser (https://github.com/merlyescalona/yagcloser), ensuring a more complete and accurate genome assembly. Finally, the chromosomal order was adjusted using the previously reported chromosome‐level genome of the closely relatedZ. japonica(F. Wang et al.,2015). The Omni‐C contact map was visualized using Juicebox. Assembly statistics were calculated using Quast v5.1.0 (Gurevich et al.,2013). To verify the genome coverage and quality of the assembled genome sequences, 4896 Poales orthologs were aligned using benchmarking universal single‐copy orthologs (BUSCOs) v5.2.2 (Manni et al.,2021). Additionally, the completeness of the genome was assessed based on 19‐mers from Illumina reads using meryl v1.3 and merqury v1.3 3 (Rhie et al.,2020). Cleaned Illumina reads were also mapped to the genome using BWA v0.7.17‐r1188 (H. Li,2013) to further support the completeness assessment.

We identified known and novel repetitive elements in theZ. sinicagenome using RepeatModeler v2.0.4 (www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) (Flynn et al.,2020) with default parameters to build a database. Prediction and masking of repeat sequences were performed using RepeatMasker v4.1.5 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/). Telomeric regions of theZ. sinicagenome were identified using the TeloExplorer module of QuarTeT (v1.2.0) with the “‐c plant” option. For centromere prediction, the CentroMiner module was utilized, incorporating transposable element annotation data to detect tandem repeat monomers. Potential centromeric repeats were filtered based on repeat period and copy number, followed by clustering to minimize redundancy. The identified regions were visualized using RIdeogram. For gene annotation, a genome with soft‐masked repeated sequences was used. The BRAKER3 pipeline (Gabriel et al.,2024; G. Pertea & Pertea,2020; Quinlan,2014) was employed to annotate the protein‐coding genes ofZ. sinicausing two different hints: short‐read RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) data and protein homology information. PRINSEQ‐lite v0.20.4 was used to trim and filter short RNA‐seq reads with the following parameters: min len 50, min qual score 10, min qual mean 20, derep 14, trim qual left 20, and trim qual right 20 (Schmieder & Edwards,2011). Cleaned reads were aligned to the genome using HISAT2 v2.2.1 (Kim et al.,2019), and the resulting mapping files were supplied to the BRAKER3 pipeline along with protein sequences from 27 species within the class Liliopsida, downloaded from NCBI (TableS1). The hints were used for training GeneMark‐ETP and AUGUSTUS to predict genes (Bruna et al.,2024).

The functional annotation of protein‐coding genes was performed using EnTAP v1.1.1 (Hart et al.,2020). Protein sequences were analyzed against the NCBI RefSeq database (O'Leary et al.,2015) and the Uniprot database using DIAMOND (Buchfink et al.,2015) with ane‐value cutoff of 1e−5. Additionally, genes were annotated with KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) terms and gene ontology terms using eggNOG‐mapper (Cantalapiedra et al.,2021; The Gene Ontology Consortium,2014; Huerta‐Cepas et al.,2017,2018; Kanehisa et al.,2016).

To ensure uniformity and accurate gene prediction, re‐annotation analyses forZ. japonica,Z. matrella, andZ. pacificawere performed using protein sequences from 27 species within the class Liliopsida. ForZ. japonicaandZ. matrella, transcriptome data were additionally downloaded from NCBI (TableS2) and integrated into the re‐annotation process. ForZ. pacifica, re‐annotation was carried out using the BRAKER2 pipeline with GeneMark‐EP+ and AUGUSTUS, as no RNA‐seq data have been reported for this species (Brůna et al.,2021). The genome annotation was visualized using Circos (Krzywinski et al.,2009), and intragenomic gene synteny was detected using MCScan software with parameters –cscore 0.99 and –minspan = 30 (Tang et al.,2024).

Genomic data for the 11 plant species were downloaded from various sources:Arabidopsis thaliana(TAIR10),Brachypodium distachyon(v3.2),Oropetium thomaeum(v1.0),Sorghum bicolor(v5.1),Setaria italica(v2.2), andZea mays(RefGen_V4) were downloaded from Phytozome 13;Oryza sativa(IRGSP‐1.0) was downloaded from Ensembl (Yates et al.,2021);S. alterniflorawas downloaded from the National Genomics Data Center under project numbers PRJCA016599 (Hao et al.,2024); andZ. japonica,Z. matrella, andZ. pacificawere downloaded from the Zoysia Genome Database (http://zoysia.kazusa.or.jp/) (Tanaka et al.,2016). Using OrthoFinder v2.5.5 with the ‐M msa option (Emms & Kelly,2018,2019), we clustered gene families for the 12 plant species. We generated a rooted species tree from a concatenated alignment of single‐copy orthologs using the STAG method in OrthoFinder. The divergence times ofZ. sinicawere inferred using this tree with MCMCtree in PAML v4.10.7, employing the JC69 model, a burn‐in of 5,000,000, a sampling frequency of 30, and 10,000,000 samples (Rannala & Yang,2007). Calibration points were sourced from the TimeTree database (https://www.timetree.org) using nwkit (Fukushima & Pollock,2023). The resulting phylogenetic tree with divergence times was visualized using MCMCtreeR v1.1 (Puttick,2019).

To infer whole‐genome duplication (WGD) events, we performed protein homology analysis across seven species using DIAMOND v2.1.9 with ane‐value cutoff of <1e−5(Buchfink et al.,2015). Collinear blocks were identified using MCScanX (Y. Wang et al.,2012), where regions containing at least five homologous genes were classified as collinear. Synonymous substitution rates (Ks) values for collinear orthologous gene pairs were calculated using the add_ka_and_ks_to_collinearity.pl script implemented in MCScanX. Visualization was conducted using Python libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn.

We analyzed gene family evolution, including expansion and contraction, for the genomes ofZ. sinicaand 11 other plant species. All input data used the protein sequences of primary transcripts. Using the gene family clusters and phylogenetic tree topology generated by OrthoFinder, we conducted the analysis with CAFE5 v1.1 (Mendes et al.,2020). CAFE employs a random birth and death model to estimate the size of gene families at each ancestral node. The significance of gene family expansion or contraction was determined with a cutoffp‐value < 0.01.

We conducted a selection pressure analysis on the 265 single‐copy orthologous gene sets retrieved from the genomes of seven species—O. sativa,O. thomaeum,S. alterniflora,Z. matrella,Z. japonica,Z. pacifica, andZ. sinica—using OrthoFinder. To prevent out‐of‐frame indels, we first aligned the translated protein sequences and then used these protein alignments to generate the codon alignments, utilizing PAL2NAL (Suyama et al.,2006) and TranslatorX (Abascal et al.,2010). The alignments were then trimmed using Gblocks (Castresana,2000) and converted into PAML input format. For the branches ofS. alternifloraandZ. sinicathat inhabit intertidal zones, as well as the branch specific toZoysia species, we identified PSGs (Álvarez‐Carretero et al.,2023). Subsequently, the branch‐site model (setting model = 2, Nssites = 2) was employed to determine the frequency of positive selection in each lineage. Two models were fitted: the alternative model with fix_omega = 0 and omega = 2, and the null model with fix_omega = 1 and omega = 1. These models were compared using a likelihood ratio test with 1 degree of freedom. Genes with ap‐value below 0.05 were classified as PSGs.

The GWC and porosity measurements were conducted in quintuplicate for each sample location. Statistical significance between the different locations was assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's post hoc test, with ap‐value of <0.05 considered significant.

For transcriptome analysis, shoot and root tissues were collected from three locations: LIZ, where roots are waterlogged during low tide; HIZ, where roots are not waterlogged during low tide; and IL (Figure3A). The reads were cleaned using PRINSEQ‐lite v0.20.4 (Schmieder & Edwards,2011) and Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al.,2014). The cleaned reads were then aligned to theZ. sinicagenome using HISAT2 v2.2.1 (Kim et al.,2019). Gene expression levels were quantified with StringTie v2.2.1 based on transcripts per million (TPM) (M. Pertea et al.,2016). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using PtR to explore relationships between sample replicates. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using edgeR with trimmed mean of M‐values‐normalized TPM counts (|log2(FoldChange)| > 2 andp‐value < 0.001). For GOBP (gene ontology in terms of biological process) and KEGG functional enrichment analysis, a BLASTp homology search was conducted with ane‐value cutoff of 1e−5betweenZ. sinicaandO. sativa(Altschul et al.,1990). GOBP and KEGG functional enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID (Sherman et al.,2022), and the significant results (p‐value < 0.05) were visualized using TBtools (C. Chen et al.,2020). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA v4.3.3 (Mootha et al.,2003; Subramanian et al.,2005). Expression datasets were ranked based on the signal‐to‐noise ratio across the sampling locations (LIZ, HIZ, and IL), and enrichment scores were computed for predefined gene sets. The ES values were then normalized to generate normalized enrichment scores (NESs). The statistical significance of the enrichment was assessed using 1000 permutations with the “gene set” option to account for variability in gene set composition.

(B–D) Gene ontology in terms of biological process (GOBP) results are shown in the upper subplots, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses are shown in the lower subplots. The figure presents the enrichment analysis of upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the low intertidal zone (LIZ) compared to the high intertidal zone (HIZ) (B) and inland (IL) (C). (D) Enrichment analysis of upregulated DEGs in HIZ compared to IL is also shown.

For RNA‐seq validation, 1 µg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using the SensiFAST cDNA Synthesis Kit (Meridian Bioscience) following the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized cDNA was used for qRT‐PCR with the SensiFAST SYBR Lo‐ROX Kit (Meridian Bioscience) on the CFX Opus 96 Real‐Time PCR System (Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Inc.), usingHTA11as the housekeeping gene, which exhibited uniform trimmed mean of M‐values‐normalized TPM values across all conditions. Primer information used in this study is listed in TableS3. qRT‐PCR was performed under the following conditions: denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 63°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 20 s. The Cq values obtained from qRT‐PCR were converted to ΔΔCq values for comparative analysis with RNA‐seq data (Livak & Schmittgen,2001). Correlation analysis between qRT‐PCR and RNA‐seq was performed using Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, and scipy.stats for statistical calculations, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

Z. sinica, a species of perennial grasses, was collected from the Gwangpo Bay, an estuarine intertidal zone where freshwater and saltwater meet, and is the largest colony ofZ. sinicain South Korea (Figure1A,B). TheZ. sinicagenome size was estimated to be 328.2 Mb using a total of 19.06 Gb of Illumina reads (TableS4; FigureS1). Thek‐mer (k= 19) distribution exhibited nearly one peak, indicating a low proportion of heterozygosity in theZ. sinicagenome. To obtain long‐read sequences that covered at least an 80× coverage depth against the estimated genome size, we produced 27.27 Gb of long‐read data with 16 kb of N50 using the Oxford Nanopore Minion sequencer (TableS5).

Tracks from the outside to the inside represent protein‐coding genes, long terminal repeat (LTR) Gypsy, LTR Copia, and intragenomic synteny based on homologous genes.

TheZ. sinicagenome was assembled using a hybrid pipeline that combined Nanopore and Illumina reads. Illumina‐based corrected Nanopore long reads, providing an 83.8× coverage of the estimated genome size, were assembled using NextDenovo. We obtained a de novo assembled genome consisting of 73 contigs with a total length of 315.7 Mb (Table1). Based on valid Omni‐C chromatin interaction data (Figure1C), the contig N50 value of 10.4 Mb was significantly improved to a scaffold N50 value of 18.9 Mb. Of the 315.7 Mb contig sequences, 312.7 Mb were scaffolded and anchored onto 20 chromosomes. Gap‐closing analysis further refined the assembly, closing three gaps and resulting in the final genome with 54 remaining gaps spanning a total of 27 Kb. The 20 chromosome‐levelZ. sinicagenomes were ordered into subgenome A (odd‐numbered chromosomes) and subgenome B (even‐numbered chromosomes) using theZ. japonicagenome as a reference (TableS6). The seven‐base telomeric repeat (CCCTAAA/TTTAGGG), which is characteristic of plants, could not be identified in theZ. sinicagenome. However, tandem repeat monomers were identified and used to predict centromeric regions. The candidate centromeres were located at comparable positions in subgenomes A and B, suggesting structural similarity between the subgenomes (FigureS2).

Abbreviations: BUSCOs, benchmarking universal single‐copy orthologs; QV, quality value.

For genome quality assessment, the integrity of theZ. sinicagenome was assessed by comparing its homology with the poales BUSCO genes. Out of 4896 core poales genes, 4783 (97.7%) complete genes were found in theZ. sinicagenome, with 3604 (73.6%) being single‐copy genes and 1179 (24.1%) being duplicated genes (Table1). Additionally, results from merqury showed that thek‐mer completeness was 86.81%, with a quality value of 35.38. Furthermore, Illumina reads mapping supported the high completeness of the genome, with 122,682,537 reads (97.69%) mapped, including 121,556,866 reads (96.79%) that were primary mapped. We then compared our newly assembledZ. sinicagenome with previously reportedZoysiagenomes including those ofZ. japonica,Z. matrella, andZ. pacificawhose assembly sizes range from 315.7 to 563.4 Mb (TableS7). Notably, theZ. sinicagenome has fewer contigs and a higher contig N50, with a scaffold N50 of 18.9 Mb and scaffold coverage of 99%. Excluding the contig‐level assemblies ofZ. matrellaandZ. pacifica,Z. sinicaexhibits the highest genome coverage at 95.3%. Collectively, these results suggest that theZ. sinicagenome exhibits excellent contiguity and is well‐suited for genome annotation and further studies.

To identify repetitive elements in theZ. sinicagenome, we predicted both known and novel repetitive elements. The repetitive element prediction analysis indicated that 42.15% of the genomic sequences were annotated (TableS8). Among the repetitive elements, retroelements and DNA transposons accounted for 23.27% and 2.62% of the genome sequence, respectively. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons were predominant because Ty1/Copia and Gypsy/DIRS1 covered 6.85% and 13.23% of the genome, respectively. In addition, 15.34% of the genome was unclassified interspersed repeats.

To predict the protein‐coding genes in the maskedZ. sinicagenome, we combined ab initio‐ and homology‐based prediction strategies using the RNA‐seq data ofZ. sinicaand the protein sets of class Liliopsida (TableS1). We identified 29,551 protein‐coding genes in theZ. sinicagenome, with an average length of 2,671 bp, 5.1 exons per gene, and an average exon length of 237 bp (Table2). The intragenomic gene synteny analysis revealed that 10 pairs among 20 chromosomes had high collinearity based on gene homology (Figure1D). A 5.6 Mb duplication and a 1.6 Mb translocation between the subgenomes were identified within genomic blocks based on the synteny of at least 30 consecutive genes (TableS9).

Statistics of predicted protein‐coding genes in theZoysiaspecies.

To ensure more reliable analysis, we re‐annotated the genomes ofZoysiaspecies (Z. japonica,Z. pacifica, andZ. matrella) using previously reported RNA‐seq data (TableS2). We used 636 Gb of RNA‐seq data fromZ. japonicaand 95 Gb fromZ. matrella, along with Liliopsida protein hints, for gene prediction and achieved high‐quality annotations. ForZ. pacifica, high‐quality annotation was obtained using only Liliopsida protein hints. The quality of gene annotation was assessed through BUSCO analysis, showing significant improvement:Z. japonicaimproved from 53.8% to 95.8%,Z. matrellafrom 56.3% to 92.5%, andZ. pacificafrom 53.5% to 75.7% (FigureS3). We predicted 32,925 genes inZ. japonica, 53,226 genes inZ. matrella, and 53,656 genes inZ. pacifica. The protein‐coding gene characteristics ofZ. sinica,Z. japonica, andZ. matrellawere similar (Table2; TableS10).

To understand the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships ofZ. sinica, we performed a comparative genomic analysis incorporating divergence time and WGD inference. We used 473,267 representative protein‐coding genes from 12 species, which were clustered into 34,222 orthogroups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed thatZ. sinicaformed a monophyletic clade with otherZoysiaspecies (Z. japonica,Z. pacifica, andZ. matrella), with the closest relationship observed withZ. pacifica(Figure2A). Divergence time estimation indicated that theZoysiaspecies gradually diverged around 3.63 (2.42–4.45) million years ago (Mya), and they diverged fromS. alternifloraandO. thomaeumaround 27.8 (21.04–33.65) Mya and 33.23 (31.48–35.85) Mya, respectively. In addition, analysis of Ks among collinear gene pairs supported these WGD and speciation events ofZ. sinica(Figure2B). The Ks values amongZoysiaspecies were very low, below 0.3, supporting the divergence time estimation (Figure2A), which rankedS. alterniflora,O. thomaeum, andO. sativain sequence. Furthermore, the Ks values of paralogs withinZ. sinicawere intermediate between the Ks values of orthologs betweenZ. sinicaandO. thomaeumand those betweenZ. sinicaandS. alterniflora. Additionally, the Ks values of paralogs withinZ. sinicawere similar to the Ks values of orthologs betweenZ. sinicaand otherZoysiaspecies. Therefore, this suggests that the WGD event inZ. sinicalikely occurred between 27.8 and 33.2 Mya. Together, these results demonstrate that the divergence ofZ. sinicawithin theZoysiagenus occurred relatively recently, and these findings provide important insights into the evolutionary history and polyploidization events that have influenced the genus.

(C and D) Gene ontology in terms of biological process (GOBP) enrichment analysis of the expanded gene families andZ. sinica‐specific genes.

To understand the genomic foundation that enabledZ. sinicato adapt to harsh intertidal environments, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis that included both gene family evolution analysis and molecular evolutionary analysis to identify genes under positive selection pressure (Figure2A). Through gene family evolution analysis, we found thatZ. sinicaexhibited expansion in only 66 gene families and contraction in 1362 gene families, with just nine gene families significantly expanded (p‐value < 0.01). These significantly expanded gene families were enriched in gene ontology terms related to macromolecule biosynthetic processes and cell wall (Figure2C). Among the expanded gene families inZ. sinica, homologs inO. sativaincluded ethylene response factors (OsERF11andOsERF17) and RNA helicases (OsRH6andOsRH12). There were 568Z. sinica‐specific genes that did not belong to any of the 12 species orthogroups, and these genes were associated with response to auxin and ethylene, response to toxic substances, and peroxisomes (Figure2D). In parallel, our molecular evolutionary analysis across fourZoysiagenomes revealed thatZ. sinicaharbored six PSGs, compared to nine, six, and 25 PSGs inZ. japonica,Z. matrella, andZ. pacifica, respectively (FigureS4; TableS11). Among them,Z. japonicaandZ. pacificashared three PSGs, indicating common selective pressures acting on these species. To further investigate the genetic basis of the adaptation ofZ. sinicato the intertidal environment, we analyzed PSGs shared betweenZ. sinicaandS. alterniflora, another species inhabiting intertidal environments. A total of 29 PSGs were found to be common to both species, while six PSGs were specific toZ. sinica, with four genes overlapping in positive selection between them (FigureS5; TableS12). The four overlapped genes were annotated to the “NmrA‐like family,” “GDSL‐like Lipase/Acylhydrolase,” “XH domain,” and “may be involved in modulation of pathogen defense and leaf cell death,” according to EGGNOG. Among the PSGs shared byZ. sinicaandS. alterniflora, several key stress response genes were identified. Genes involved in nitrogen‐use efficiency (ENOD), osmotic regulation (SUT), and salt and ABA responses (AP2/EREBP) were detected. In addition, genes related to fungal defense, including RING finger E3 ligase and nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (PPI), were also under positive selection. These results indicate that gene families associated with stress responses have undergone expansion, contraction, and positive selection inZ. sinica, providing genomic insights into their association with intertidal environments.

We conducted a landscape transcriptomic study to examine gene expression patterns across intertidal environments with different levels of waterlogging. The physical characteristics of the soil in the intertidal environments and IL were investigated, showing significant differences in GWC among the three locations. HIZ soil had an average water content of 25.12% and LIZ soil had 22.92%, both significantly higher than the 17.66% observed in IL soil (FigureS6; TableS13andS14).

The transcriptome data from shoot and root tissues ofZ. sinicacollected from the three locations formed clusters in PCA analysis, indicating high‐quality biological replicates (FigureS7; TableS15). In shoot tissues, our analysis revealed that 84 genes were upregulated in LIZ versus HIZ, 222 in LIZ versus IL, and 156 in HIZ versus IL. In root tissues, 202 genes were upregulated in LIZ versus HIZ, 147 in LIZ versus IL, and 45 in HIZ versus IL. To interpret the biological context of the DEGs identified between locations, we performed GOBP and KEGG enrichment analyses (Figure3). In the LIZ location,Z. sinicashowed significant upregulation of various genes related to nitrogen metabolism in roots compared to other locations. In shoots, genes associated with nitrogen metabolism, response to cold, carbohydrate metabolic process, and polysaccharide catabolic process were upregulated compared to IL. In the HIZ location, compared to IL, genes related to Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms such as ethylene‐activated signaling pathway and response to cold were upregulated in the shoot.

Focusing on adaptation to persistent waterlogging stress, we identified DEGs uniquely upregulated in the LIZ environment across tidal cycles. We identified 42 DEGs specifically upregulated in the shoot (Figure4A) and 36 DEGs in the root (Figure4B) of the LIZ location. Notably, the DEGs specifically upregulated in the root tissue of LIZ included seven transporter genes (Figure4C). The genes involved in suberin biosynthesis were upregulated in the shoot tissue (Figure4D). In the root tissue, genes related to nitrate uptake (NRT2.2andNRT2.4), root–shoot nitrate translocation (NRT2.3a), nitrate reductase (NR), and glutamine synthesis (GSandNADH‐GOGAT1) were upregulated under LIZ condition. Furthermore,EREBPandERFgenes associated with ethylene response were upregulated in the root tissue under HIZ conditions. Our transcriptomic analysis across intertidal zones revealed distinct expression patterns, with a specific focus on genes uniquely upregulated in the consistently waterlogged LIZ environment. Notably, genes associated with suberin biosynthesis in the shoots and nitrate metabolism in the roots were significantly upregulated, suggesting they may play important roles in adaptation to persistent waterlogging environments.

To further investigate how multiple environmental factors influence theZ. sinicatranscriptomes across locations with varying degrees of waterlogging, we performed GSEA. A total of 224 genes were assigned to response to heat (GO:0009408), 524 genes to response to salt stress (GO:0009651), 362 genes to response to water deprivation (GO:0009414), and 500 genes to response to abscisic acid (GO:0009737). In shoot tissues, GSEA revealed that the ABA response gene set was significantly enriched in intertidal conditions (LIZ and HIZ) compared to IL (false discovery rate [FDR = 0.0]) (Figure5A). The heat response gene set was significantly enriched in HIZ relative to the combined conditions of LIZ and IL (REST) (FDR = 0.0). In root tissues, we revealed that the ABA, salt stress, and water deprivation gene sets were significantly enriched in intertidal conditions (LIZ and HIZ) compared to IL (all FDR = 0.0) (Figure5B). The heat response gene set was significantly enriched in HIZ relative to the combined conditions of LIZ and IL (REST) (FDR = 0.0). Interestingly, unlike in the shoot tissue, where response to heat gene sets were positively enriched (NES = 1.76), the root tissue exhibited a negative correlation with NES = −1.54, suggesting tissue‐specific differences in heat stress responses. Taken together, these results suggest that both the shoot and root transcriptomes ofZ. sinicaare likely influenced by multiple abiotic environmental factors, including salt stress, water deprivation, and heat, across intertidal zones with varying waterlogging levels.

The result shows significant enrichment of gene sets related to response to heat (GO:0009408), response to salt stress (GO:0009651), response to water deprivation (GO:0009414), and response to abscisic acid (GO:0009737) in (A) shoot and (B) root tissues.

To validate the RNA‐seq results, qRT‐PCR analysis based on the ΔΔCq method showed a high correlation with the RNA‐seq data (FigureS8). Notably, five DEGs in the shoot exhibited a strong correlation between qRT‐PCR and RNA‐seq data (R2= 0.9162, Pearsonr= 0.96, Spearman rho = 0.98), further supporting the reliability of the transcriptomic analysis.

In this study, we generated a high‐quality chromosome‐level genome ofZ. sinica, a salt marsh grass adapted to saline and anoxic conditions. Compared to the previously reported chromosome‐level genome ofZ. japonica, which was scaffolded using a linkage map and reached 81.8% scaffolding coverage (Tanaka et al.,2016), theZ. sinicagenome exhibits significantly improved contiguity and completeness, with 95.3% scaffolding coverage (TableS7). As a result,Z. sinicaachieved the highest genome coverage (99%) and Poales BUSCO score (95.3%) amongZoysiaspecies, compared toZ. japonica, which had a BUSCO score of 92.9%. This high‐quality genome not only enabled reliable genomic research on the polyploid structure ofZoysiaspecies but also provided an opportunity to identify marker genes involved in resilience to abiotic stresses, including waterlogging stress (Cheng et al.,2023; Njaci et al.,2023). Furthermore, it provides an important foundation for molecular breeding techniques such as marker‐assisted selection and gene editing.

To facilitate comparative genomic studies, we re‐annotated the protein‐coding genes ofZoysiaspecies (Z. japonica,Z. matrella, andZ. pacifica) using RNA‐seq data and protein data available until recently (TableS2). This re‐annotation was confirmed to have improved integrity, as demonstrated by BUSCO analysis, ensuring high‐quality gene annotation (FigureS3). Compared to previous annotation results (Tanaka et al.,2016), the number of protein‐coding genes was reduced by half in bothZ. japonicaandZ. matrella, whileZ. pacificashowed a reduction of approximately 12,000 genes. This reduction is due to improvements in the accuracy and reliability of gene annotation. Previous annotations relied on limited gene expression data, which likely led to overestimating the number of genes. In contrast, our approach combined ab initio prediction, RNA‐seq data, and protein homology information, allowing us to retain only genes that were strongly supported by multiple sources of evidence (Brůna et al.,2021; Gabriel et al.,2024). The mean gene length in the chromosome‐level genomes ofZ. sinicaandZ. japonicawas much longer than that in the draft genomes ofZ. matrellaandZ. pacifica(Table2), underscoring the importance of high‐quality genome assemblies for accurate genome annotation.

Comparative genomic analysis provided insights into the speciation timing ofZoysiaspecies and the timing of the WGD event inZ. sinica(Figure2A,B). It is likely that the WGD event in the common ancestor of theZoysiagenus occurred between its divergence fromS. alterniflora(21.04–33.65 Mya) andO. thomaeum(31.48–35.85 Mya), coinciding with the speciation event fromS. alterniflora(S. Chen et al.,2024). Paleoclimatic evidence indicates significant environmental shifts during the Miocene epoch, such as increased aridification, expansion of open grasslands, and declining atmospheric CO₂ levels (Bouchenak‐Khelladi et al.,2014; Gallaher et al.,2022). These climatic factors may have created selective pressures conducive to polyploidization, potentially enhancing adaptability to fluctuating water availability, increased salinity, and nutrient‐poor soils. Additionally, it can be inferred thatZoysiaspecies underwent speciation around 2.6–3.6 Mya. This period coincided with the intensification of monsoonal patterns in East Asia, leading to alternating droughts and the expansion of salt‐affected wetlands (Dunlea et al.,2020). These climatic fluctuations likely influenced the adaptation and diversification ofZoysia, which is now predominantly distributed along coastal regions from temperate to tropical Southeast and Southern Asia. The inferred WGD and speciation events provide a genomic basis for understanding the geological and ecological distribution ofZoysiaspecies in these dynamic environments.

The gene family evolutionary analysis provided evidence for the adaptation ofZ. sinicato intertidal environments. The expansion of gene families related to ethylene signaling (ERF11andERF17) (Tan et al.,2021; Zhou et al.,2016), auxin transport (ABCB19) (Sukumar et al.,2013), and reactive oxygen species scavenging (APX2andCATB) (Mahmood et al.,2021; Zhang et al.,2013) suggests their roles in regulating growth, oxidative stress tolerance, and root system development under periodic submergence. We identified six PSGs inZ. sinica, including GDSL‐like lipase (GELP), which is associated with suberin biosynthesis in roots (Nomberg et al.,2022; Ursache et al.,2021), and theNmrA‐like family gene, which plays a role in nitrogen metabolism (Mao et al.,2023) (TableS12). These genes may be associated with oxygen availability in hypoxic soil environments and contribute to nitrate‐based energy metabolism. Additionally,Z. sinicashares several PSGs withS. alterniflora, including genes related to nitrogen metabolism (ENOD) (BI et al.,2009) and osmotic stress tolerance (AP2/EREBP,SUT, andHAK1) (G. Chen et al.,2017; Y. Li et al.,2022; Xu et al.,2017). The presence of these genes under positive selection suggests that both species have been shaped by similar evolutionary pressures to survive in environments characterized by periodic waterlogging and salt fluctuations.

Building upon these genomic findings, transcriptome analysis examined responses ofZ. sinicato varying soil moisture conditions across intertidal zones. The observed upregulation of nitrate uptake‐related genes in root tissues from the LIZ environment suggests their potential involvement in adaptive responses to hypoxic conditions prevalent in intertidal environments (Figure3). A similar upregulation of nitrate transporter genes under waterlogging stress has also been observed in mangrove plants, representative species adapted to intertidal zones (Su et al.,2022). These observations, together with previous findings (G. Li et al.,2016), suggest that the upregulation of nitrate transporters, such asNRT2.2andNRT2.4inZ. sinica, may contribute to adaptive responses by influencing root hydraulic properties and potentially facilitating water uptake under fluctuating moisture conditions. In shoot tissues, the upregulation of suberin biosynthesis genes may help reduce radial oxygen loss and enhance adaptation to frequent submergence by maintaining cellular homeostasis and minimizing ion imbalance (Figure4) (Kreszies et al.,2020; Ranathunge et al.,2011). Additionally,Z. sinicasamples were collected during low tide, exposing them to aeration and a post‐submergence state. As a result, prolonged submergence followed by re‐exposure to atmospheric oxygen may lead to a water deprivation state (Figure5) (Fukao et al.,2010; Setter et al.,2010; Shahzad et al.,2016; Yeung et al.,2018). In response,Z. sinicamay activate ABA‐mediated signaling to facilitate submergence recovery and regulate water balance. These transcriptomic responses align with the genomic findings, suggesting that genes under positive selection, such asGELP,NmrA‐like family genes, andENOD, play roles in optimizing nitrogen use and maintaining structural integrity under intertidal conditions. While our transcriptome analysis focused on responses to varying soil moisture, it is important to acknowledge that intertidal zones are complex environments where other abiotic factors, such as fluctuations in salinity and temperature, are also prevalent. These factors could act as confounding co‐stressors and potentially contribute to or modulate the observed transcriptomic profiles, and their specific impacts warrant further investigation in conjunction with waterlogging stress.

In summary, the chromosome‐level genome ofZ. sinicaprovides molecular evolutionary insights into the mechanisms of adaptation and survival in intertidal environments. This study shifts the focus from the traditionally studied salt stress tolerance in zoysiagrass to a new perspective on the mechanisms of waterlogging stress responses, establishing a foundation for future research on this abiotic stress. Additionally, our landscape transcriptome study enhances our understanding of population responses to environmental variables, offering deep genomic insights with ecological significance. While these genomic and transcriptomic analyses offer significant insights, future functional studies are crucial to experimentally confirm the roles of the identified candidate genes in the adaptation ofZ. sinicato intertidal stresses. This research provides a foundation for the development of new abiotic stress‐tolerant varieties through molecular breeding methods.
