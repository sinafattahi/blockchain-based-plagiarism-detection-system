This review was conducted to assess the role of non‐conventional feed in small ruminant production and its implication for feed cost reduction. Non‐conventional feed is an alternative feed source that is not commonly used in small ruminant production. The role of these feeds in small ruminant production has several implications. They can help to address the feed scarcity that small‐scale farmers often face. Using these alternative feeds, farmers can supplement their animals even when traditional feeds are scarce. They are usually abundant and often available at lower costs. Their utilization aids in reducing the farmers’ reliance on expensive conventional feeds, thereby decreasing feed costs in small ruminant production. Properly managed and balanced feed can provide a diverse range of nutrients needed for small ruminants. Diversifying the feed farmers can mitigate nutrient deficiencies and ensure more balanced diets for their animals. Incorporating these feeds into small ruminant production can promote sustainable agriculture practices. Utilizing non‐conventional can reduce waste, effectively recycling these materials as valuable feed instead of disposal. They help to enhance the resilience and adaptability of small ruminants to different feed conditions. However, it is essential to note that the successful utilization of non‐conventional feed requires proper management and knowledge. Issues such as nutrient imbalances, anti‐nutritional factors and feed processing techniques should be considered to ensure the optimal utilization of feed sources in small ruminant production. Further research and extension services are needed to support farmers in effectively integrating non‐conventional feeds into their feeding practices.

The use of non‐conventional feeds as small ruminant feed is the best solution to overcome feed scarcity, reduce impact on the environment and reduce feed costs.

Ethiopia has a large population of small ruminants, which are mostly kept in traditional subsistence production systems (Jemberu et al.2022). The estimated population in the country is to be about 42.9 million sheep and 52.5 million goats at the country level (CSA2021). Small ruminants have great potential to enhance the global food system, improve human health and alleviate poverty (Tella and Chineke2022). Their production plays a vital role in terms of generating employment opportunities, income generation, improving family nutrition, ensuring household food security and for foreign exchange earnings at the national level (Wodajo et al.2020; Mijena and Getiso2022; Mahamed and Ali2023). In addition, they are a source of risk mitigation, security, investment, saving and socio‐economic and cultural functions (Mahamed and Ali2023). The number of small ruminants in Ethiopia is large and widely distributed, but productivity is low due to slow growth, high lamb/kid mortality and limited potential for meat production (Mijena and Getiso2022). Feed shortage is one of the major factors that governed the small ruminant production and productivity in Ethiopia; therefore, systematic utilization of seasonally available feeds through the preservation of crop residues and strategic supplementation with low‐cost alternatives should be done (Mahamed and Ali2023). Improvements to small ruminant production and sustainable development in the country's various farming systems using creative methods to fulfil the needs of the growing human population (Mulatu and Abebe2023). Better use of unconventional feed resources that do not compete with human food will be necessary to feed small ruminants and ensure their food security in the future due to the growing demand for small ruminants brought on by the world economies’ rapid growth and the shrinking land area (Onte et al.2021).

Non‐conventional feed resources can be taken as a major part of small ruminant diets (Singh2018). Feeds classified as non‐conventional are those that are not often found in the market and do not contain the typical ingredients utilized in the production of commercial feed. They include leftovers from regional beverages likeAreke,TellaandKhat; fruit and vegetables by‐products; poultry manure; animal processing wastes like fish or monogastric animal offal and feather meal (Murgato and Korato2023). They are readily and affordably accessible (Singh2018). A portion of the energy and protein content of those unconventional feed sources is higher (Murgato and Korato2023). Non‐conventional feeds have the potential to partially close the feed supply gap, minimize animal‐human competition for resources, lower feed costs and promote nutrient self‐sufficiency from locally accessible feed resources (Onte et al.2021). Using these feed resources can reduce the dependence on imported feeds or expensive commercial feeds; enhance the utilization of natural resources; mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; increase income opportunities for farmers and contribute to food security and poverty reduction (Abreha et al.2020; Murgato and Korato2023). Their low nutritional value, seasonal availability, high handling and transportation costs from the production site to the farm and the existence of anti‐nutritional elements are some of the factors that may contribute to their restricted utilization (Onte et al.2021). Thus, alternative diets made from local supplies have been investigated as viable ways to satisfy small ruminants’ nutritional needs while minimizing their negative effects on the environment and improving their resource efficiency. Therefore, this review recaps the role and its implication for feed cost reduction of non‐conventional feed resources in small ruminant production in Ethiopia.

Non‐conventional feed resources include a range of feeds made from perennial crops, multipurpose trees and shrubs, weeds and agro‐industrial by‐products (Katoch et al.2018). Amata (2015) reported that in the future, browse foliage (fodder trees and shrubs), agro‐industrial by‐products and crop leftovers will all play a bigger part in providing feed. Non‐conventional feed sources include fish offal, duckweed, kitchen leftovers (such as potato, carrot, onion and cabbage peels), poultry litter, algae,Leucaenaleaf, sisal waste, cactus, coffee parchment and coffee pulp and are frequently obtained from these sources (Onte et al.2021). Sahoo et al. (2021) determined that fruit and vegetable waste might be used as a viable feed source for ruminants and that recycling it effectively would reduce the negative environmental effects of disposing of it in landfills. Rubber seed cake, salted seed meal, tapioca waste, tea waste,babulseeds, by‐products from slaughterhouses, mango seed kernels,nigerseed cake,karanjcake, guar meal,Prosopis juliflorapods and cassava leaf meal, sea buckthorn leaves, cake and pomace and animal organic wastes (bovine and poultry excreta) are a few of the potentially available non‐conventional feed resources (Areaya2018). With their moderate protein and lower fibre concentrations, non‐conventional feeds likeatellaand mill waste can be used as possible protein sources to raise the nutritional value of poor tropical feeds in the animal feeding systems (Gebremariam and Belay2021). Bamboo is an unconventional feed supplement used in the production of ruminant animals. Adding bamboo to feed small ruminants can increase weight and feed intake for basal diets by 2.31 kg and 40%, respectively (Daniel et al.2022).

The implication of non‐conventional feed in small ruminant production for reducing feed costs can be significant if managed properly (Singh2018). Smallholder farmers utilize unconventional feed resources, like by‐products from nearby breweries and distilleries, because they are inexpensive and readily available (Nurfeta2010). Utilizing these feeds as a part of the ration can help reduce the dependency on expensive conventional feeds, which can lead to substantial cost savings for smallholder farmers. Ethiopia faces challenges in feed availability, especially during dry seasons when conventional feed sources become scarce. Non‐conventional feeds, being more abundant and often available year‐round, can help fill this feed gap and ensure consistent access to feed for small ruminants (Murgato and Korato2023). By using non‐conventional feeds, small ruminant farmers in Ethiopia can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. These feeds, often considered agricultural by‐products or residues, divert waste materials from landfills and utilize them as valuable feed resources instead (Sahoo et al.2021). Smallholder farmers can get good results by supplementing feed withatella, chicken litter, bamboo and coffee pulp instead of concentrated feed in urban and peri‐urban settings where these resources are accessible as indicated in Table1. Incorporating chicken litter into a diet that includes coffee pulp may help to counteract the anti‐nutritional elements in the pulp and enhance its consumption (Nurfeta2010). Calcium oxide‐treated coffee hulls can replace corn silage at up to 160 g/kg without negatively impacting lamb performance or meat quality (Nunes et al.2020). Adding bamboo to feed small ruminants can increase weight and feed intake for basal diets by 2.31 kg and 40%, respectively (Daniel et al.2022).

Incorporating non‐conventional feeds into small ruminant diets allows for a diversification of feed sources. This reduces the reliance on a single feed type, reducing the risk associated with feed shortages or fluctuations in feed prices. It also enhances the resilience of the production system by providing alternative options (Abreha et al.2020). Many unconventional feed sources are readily available and reasonably priced, making them suitable for a significant portion of small ruminant diets (Singh2018). Utilizing these feed resources promotes local resource utilization, reducing the reliance on external feed sources and strengthening the local economy. To use native and enhanced multipurpose trees and shrubs (Faidherbia albidaandSesbania sesban leaves) as well as locally accessible non‐conventional feeds (atella) as supplements to increase small ruminant output makes sense economically (Abreha et al.2020). Though, it is essential to note that the successful reduction of feed costs through non‐conventional feed usage requires proper management, including feed processing, balancing of rations, addressing nutritional limitations and overcoming challenges associated with anti‐nutritional factors and low digestibility. The nutritional value of particular feed sources and how to effectively incorporate them into small ruminant diets are not well known to farmers. It is equally crucial for local extension organizations to be involved in technology creation, appraisal and transfer for the effective use of non‐conventional feed resources (Beriso2022). Adequate knowledge, training and support for small ruminant farmers are crucial to ensuring the effective utilization of non‐conventional feeds while optimizing cost‐reduction benefits.

While non‐conventional feed sources offer potential benefits for feed cost reduction in small ruminant production in Ethiopia, there are also challenges and consequences associated with their use.

Non‐conventional feeds often have varying nutritional profiles and can be deficient in certain essential nutrients. Agro‐industrial by‐products, several common tropical browsing plants and leaf meals are among the potentially accessible non‐conventional feed resources. Some non‐conventional feed products are known to have significant quantities of lignin, silica, toxins and various anti‐nutritional chemicals, while having poor calorie and protein content (Amata2015; Beriso2022). Their low nutritional value, seasonal availability, high handling and transportation costs from the production site to the farm and the existence of anti‐nutritional elements are some of the factors that may contribute to their restricted utilization (Onte et al.2021). Their limited use, however, may be due to several issues, including their low nutritional content and difficulties handling and utilizing over prolonged periods (Murgato and Korato2023). If not properly balanced or supplemented, relying solely on these feeds can lead to nutrient deficiencies in small ruminants, affecting their growth, reproduction and overall health (Beriso2022). These factors reduce feed intake, nutrient absorption and overall animal performance. However, the research found that processing methods like fermentation, boiling, autoclaving, sun drying and soaking have been utilized to diminish the effectiveness of these anti‐nutrients to a more manageable level (Beriso and Tesfaye2024).

Non‐conventional feeds, particularly crop residues and tree leaves, can have lower digestibility compared to conventional feeds. This can limit the amount of energy and nutrients that small ruminants can extract from these feeds, hence affecting their productivity. The low DM content inatellaand the larger fibre percentage in pulse hulls can cause the lack of significant difference in DM digestion.Atellalower DM, lower fibre fraction and greater CP may have accelerated transit and shortened the time needed for digestion (Mekasha et al.2002). Before using the diet's contents, the anti‐nutritional elements must be eliminated or rendered inactive through a variety of techniques. This is especially crucial because prolonged exposure to certain toxic or anti‐nutritional substances at relatively low concentrations may negatively impact the body's metabolism (Areaya2018). Even though they have high nutritional values, the use of non‐conventional feedstuffs derived from plants has been restricted due to the presence of various compounds such as cyanoglycosides, alkaloids, glycosides, phytates, protease inhibitors, haematoglutinin, saponegin and momosine (Beriso2022). The study found that replacing maize grain with mango seeds enhanced digestibility, milk yield, feed conversion and economic efficiency, while having no negative effects on goat performance (El‐Sanafawy et al.2023).

While non‐conventional feeds can be abundant, their availability may be seasonal or limited to specific regions. In addition, accessing and collecting these feed resources can be laborious and time‐consuming, affecting the practicality of using them on a larger scale (Onte et al.2021). The study concluded that drying and ensiling non‐conventional feeds like fruit and vegetable waste are preservation methods that serve as a practical solution to seasonal availability issues (Wadhwa and Bakshi2013).

Proper utilization of non‐conventional feeds requires proper management, processing and balancing of feed rations. Many small‐scale farmers may lack the knowledge, skills and resources necessary to effectively incorporate these feed sources into their feeding practices (Amata2015). The other obstacles to utilizing unconventional feed supplies are the procedures involved in the collection, dehydration to achieve a high moisture content and detoxification (Beriso2022).

Inadequate nutrition due to improper utilization of non‐conventional feeds can lead to poor growth rates, decreased reproductive performance and increased susceptibility to diseases in small ruminants. As noted by Suharti et al. (2019), feeding 30% bitter cassava leaf meal without cyanide‐degrading bacteria led to lower body weight gain and feed efficiency for small ruminants. At higher inclusion levels, anti‐nutritional substances hinder growth and other physiological functions (Beriso2022). However, several in vivo studies have demonstrated that the dietary inclusion of fruit and vegetable by‐products resulted in improved milk production and composition without any negative effect on animal performance (Jalal et al.2023).

In some cases, when non‐conventional feeds are poorly utilized, farmers may have to rely more heavily on purchased conventional feeds to compensate for nutritional shortcomings. This can lead to increased feed costs and undermine the intended cost‐saving benefits. Inefficient or improper utilization of non‐conventional feeds can result in wastage, reducing the overall benefits of these feed resources and exacerbating feed scarcity issues.

Non‐conventional feed is an alternative feed source that is not commonly used in small ruminant production. Feeds classified as non‐conventional are those that are not often found in the market and do not contain the typical ingredients utilized in the production of commercial feed. Non‐conventional feed sources include agro‐industrial by‐products, crop residue, animal wastes, duckweed and algae, kitchen leftovers, browser foliage, sisal waste, cactus, coffee parchment and coffee pulp. The implication of non‐conventional feed in small ruminant production for reducing feed costs can be significant if managed properly. While non‐conventional feed sources offer potential benefits for feed cost reduction in small ruminant production in Ethiopia, there are also challenges and consequences associated with their use.
