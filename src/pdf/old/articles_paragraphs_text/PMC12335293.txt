The prognostic impact of Fms‐like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)‐tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well defined. The authors described outcomes of one of the largest cohorts of patients withFLT3‐TKD mutated (FLT3‐TKDmut) AML to date.

This retrospective study included patients with newly diagnosed AML who received frontline treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from January 2012 to March 2024 divided into two cohorts:FLT3‐TKDmutAML and nucleophosmin‐mutated (NPM1mut)/FLT3‐TKD wild‐type (FLT3‐TKDwt) AML. Patients withFLT3internal tandem duplication mutations were excluded.

In total, 2922 patients were screened, and 250 met inclusion criteria, including 124 patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML and 126 patients withNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML. In theFLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 124), intensive chemotherapy was received by 54 patients (44%), with a composite complete remission in 81% and a 3‐year overall survival (OS) rate of 56%. AnNPM1mutation was noted in 24 patients (44%) who had improved OS (3‐year OS, 74% vs. 40%;p= .03). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation improved OS in patients who hadNPM1wtAML (3‐year OS, 89% vs. 30%;p= .02) but not in those who had anNPM1mutation. Lower intensity therapy was received by 70 patients (56%), with a composite complete remission in 63% and a 3‐year OS rate of 23%. AnNPM1mutation was noted in 31 patients (44%) who had improved OS (3‐year OS, 32% vs. 16%;p= .04). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation led to a trend toward improved OS in patients who hadNPM1wtAML (3‐year OS, 75% vs. 27%;p= .1) but not in those who hadNPM1mutAML. In theNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort (n= 126), intensive chemotherapy was received by 46 patients (37%), and lower intensity therapy was received by 80 patients (63%). Compared with theNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDmutcohort, no difference in OS was noted between patients who received intensive chemotherapy and those who received lower intensity therapy.

FLT3‐TKDmutAML commonly harborsNPM1co‐mutation, which has key prognostic implications. Lack ofNPM1co‐mutation portends a poor prognosis, and allogenic stem cell transplantation should be strongly considered for patients in first remission.

FLT3‐tyrosine kinase domain–mutated acute myeloid leukemia commonly harborsNPM1co‐mutation, which has key prognostic implications. Lack ofNPM1co‐mutation inFLT3–tyrosine kinase domain–mutated acute myeloid leukemia portends a poor prognosis, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be strongly considered in first remission for this group.

In contrast, the prognostic role ofFLT3‐TKDmuthas remained less well defined. In a study of 147 patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML who received IC without an FLT3i drug, the presence of anFLT3‐TKD mutation by itself did not appear to have an effect on overall survival (OS) or event‐free survival (EFS).10The prognostic effect was highly co‐mutation–dependent. The presence of anFLT3‐TKD mutation was associated with worse outcomes when co‐occurring with unfavorable‐risk mutations, such asFLT3‐ITD andKMT2A‐partial tandem duplication mutations. Conversely, when co‐occurring with favorable‐risk mutations like nucleophosmin(NPM1) andCEBPA, it seemed to further enhance the favorable effect of these mutations. A previous study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) also demonstrated that the presence of anFLT3‐TKD co‐mutation was associated with improved relapse‐free survival and a trend toward improved OS inNPM1mutAML.11FLT3‐TKD andNPM1mutations often co‐occur, with prior studies reporting the presence of co‐occurringNPM1mutations in approximately 50%–55% of patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML.11,12This emphasizes the importance of closely evaluatingNPM1mutational status when assessing the prognostic and therapeutic implications ofFLT3‐TKDmutAML.

In a more recent meta‐analysis of 10 studies,FLT3‐TKD mutation was not associated with a significant effect on disease‐free survival or OS.13However, that analysis did not evaluate co‐mutational status and its effect on prognosis. In addition, data regarding specific induction chemotherapy regimens were not reported. With the exception of two studies, all of the other studies included in that meta‐analysis were published before 2017 and thus were unlikely to capture the effect of subsequently approved treatments for frontline AML, including venetoclax (VEN) and FLT3i drugs.14,15There is very limited data in published literature describing the outcomes of frontlineFLT3‐TKDmutAML incorporating these more recently approved and effective agents. In the current study, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of one of the largest cohorts of frontlineFLT3‐TKDmutAML, including for the first time the effect of incorporating VEN, FLT3i drugs, and the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) on outcomes in frontlineFLT3‐TKDmutAML. We also describe the prognostic impact ofNPM1co‐mutation in patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML.

This was a retrospective study conducted at MDACC. We initially screened 2922 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML (excluding those with acute promyelocytic leukemia and core binding factor AML) who received frontline therapy at MDACC from January 2012 to March 2024 (see Figure1, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CONSORT] diagram). Among these, 124 patients hadFLT3‐TKDmutAML, and 126 hadNPM1mutations withFLT3‐TKD wild type (FLT3‐TKDwt) AML.FLT3mutations were detected using polymerase chain reaction analysis followed by capillary electrophoresis, as described previously.16Other mutations were detected with targeted next‐generation sequencing (NGS) performed at our institution (using panels with either 28, 53, or 81 myeloid genes, depending on the period when NGS was performed, as previously published by our group).17,18For the current study, we included patients in two cohorts:FLT3‐TKDmutAML (with or withoutNPM1mutation) andNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML (used as acomparatorcohort to better assess the effect of co‐occurrence ofNPM1andFLT3‐TKD mutations, which are relatively common, as described above11,12). Patients withFLT3‐ITDmutAML were excluded from both cohorts.

Based on age and fitness at the time of frontline treatment, patients received induction with either IC or low‐intensity therapy (LIT). IC treatment regimens included high‐dose cytarabine (1–2 g/m2) in combination with anthracyclines (idarubicin, daunorubicin) and/or nucleoside analogues (cladribine, fludarabine, clofarabine). LIT regimens included combined azacitidine, decitabine, and guadecitabine (HMA) either alone or in combination with VEN (since 2018). In addition, patients who were treated on protocol with the regimen of cladribine and low‐dose cytarabine (<100 mg/m2) with or without VEN19and those who received targeted therapies, such as an FLT3i alone or in combination with HMA or HMA/VEN, were also included in the LIT group. Patients who were treated either on or off clinical trial protocols were included.

The primary study objective was to describe the response rates and survival outcomes (OS and EFS) of patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML according to the type of induction therapy received (IC or LIT). Response assessment was performed using the International Working Group criteria.20A composite complete remission (CRc) was defined as the sum of patients who had complete remission (CR) and patients who had complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Secondary objectives included determining the prognostic effect ofNPM1co‐mutation, VEN‐containing and/or FLT3i‐containing IC or LIT therapies, and ASCT in patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML. We also evaluated the outcomes ofFLT3‐TKD wild‐type status in patients withNPM1mutAML.

Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate baseline imbalances between groups. The Fisher exact test and the two‐sided Mann–WhitneyUtest were used to assess differences in groups for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The level of significance was set at α < .05. Patients who died or were lost to follow‐up after induction and before response assessment were also classified as nonresponders. OS was calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of death or last follow‐up. EFS was calculated from the date of treatment initiation to date of the earliest event (start of alternate therapy for no response, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first) and was censored if the patient was alive and without any event at last follow‐up. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the log‐rank test was used to assess survival differences between groups. GraphPad Prism version 10.0 (GraphPad Inc.) and R studio version 4.4.2 (R Core Team) were used to perform statistical analyses.

Landmark analysis was conducted to compare the OS of patients who underwent ASCT versus those who did not. Only patients who were aged 70 years or younger at the time of induction therapy, had achieved a CRc, and were alive at the specified landmark time were included in the comparator/nontransplantation group. The median time to ASCT for the population being evaluated was chosen as the landmark time for analysis. An age cutoff for the comparator/nontransplantation group was chosen based on the age of the oldest patient withFLT3‐TKDmutAML who underwent ASCT in our cohort, which was 70 years.

In total, 250 patients were included in two cohorts: anFLT3‐TKDmutAML cohort (n= 124) and anNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML cohort (n= 126).

In the entireFLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 124), the median age was 65 years (range, 25–89 years), and 55 patients (44%) were female. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table1. The most commonFLT3‐TKD mutation was D835 (78%), followed by N676 (11%), and D839 (4%). Details of all individual TKD point mutations included are provided in the Supporting Information (see TableS1). Frontline induction therapy was IC in 54 patients (44%) and LIT in 70 patients (56%).

In the ICFLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 54), the median age was 54 years (range, 25–80 years).NPM1was co‐mutated in 24 patients (44%). VEN was added to the IC regimen in 17 patients (32%), an FLT3i was added in 10 patients (18%), and neither was added in 27 patients (50%). Details of the FLT3i drugs added and the specific regimens used are provided in Figure2. In the IC cohort, in total, 44 patients (81%) attained a CRc (for response details, see Figure2A). At a median follow‐up of 43 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.6–50.6 months), the median OS for the ICFLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 54) was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 12.5 months to NR), the 3‐year OS rate was 56%. The median event‐free survival (EFS) was also NR (95% CI, 10 months to NR), and 3‐year EFS rate was 53% (Figure3A,B).

When stratified by the addition of VEN and/or an FLT3i, a CRc was attained in 16 of 17 patients (94%) who received VEN, seven of 10 (70%) who received an FLT3i, and 21 of 27 (78%) who received neither VEN nor an FLT3i (Figure2B). The 3‐year OS rate for IC + VEN, IC + FLT3i, and IC alone was 74%, 70%, and 42%, respectively (p= .1); whereas the 3‐year EFS rate for these groups was 74%, 70%, and 35%, respectively (p= .05). Pair‐wise log‐rank tests indicated improved EFS (p= .03) and a trend toward improved OS (p= .07) with IC + VEN versus IC alone. In addition, there was a trend toward improved EFS and OS (p= .2 for both) with IC + FLT3i versus IC alone (see FigureS1). There was no difference in OS or EFS with IC + VEN versus IC + FLT3i (p= .7 andp= .6. respectively).

When stratifying the ICFLT3‐TKDmutcohort according toNPM1status, theNPM1wtgroup had more patients with secondary AML and adverse cytogenetics (including complex, chromosome 5 and 7 deletion, and other abnormalities; Table1). A CRc was attained in 24 of 24NPM1–co‐mutated patients (100%) and in 20 of 30NPM1wtpatients (67%; for response details, see Figure2A). In addition,NPM1–co‐mutated patients a had higher median OS and median EFS compared withNPM1wtpatients: the median OS was NR for both OS and EFS (3‐year OS, 74% vs. 40%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.9;p= .03) and the median EFS was NR for both (3‐year EFS, 65% vs. 42%, respectively; HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.96;p= .046; see FigureS3C,D).

Among patients in the ICFLT3‐TKDmutAML cohort (n= 54), 25 patients (46%) underwent ASCT in first remission, with median time to ASCT (from the date of treatment initiation) of 4.4 months (range, 2.1–14.2 months). For these patients, the median age was 47 years (range, 25–63 years), and 13 patients (52%) hadNPM1co‐mutations. On landmark analysis, which was set at 4.4 months, patients who underwent ASCT had numerically higher but statistically nonsignificantly longer 3‐year OS compared with those who did not undergo ASCT (median OS, NR for both; 3‐year OS, 83% vs. 64%, respectively; HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–1.4;p= .1; FigureS2A). When stratified byNPM1status, OS was similar with and without ASCT amongNPM1–co‐mutated patients (3‐year OS, 77% vs. 70%, respectively;p= .4). Conversely, among patients withoutNPM1co‐mutations, those who underwent ASCT had a longer median OS compared with those who did not, albeit with small numbers in this comparison (median OS, NR for both; 3‐year OS, 89% vs. 30%, respectively; HR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.01–1.1;p= .02; see FigureS2B,C).

In the LITFLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 70), the median age was 70.5 years (range, 50–89 years).NPM1was co‐mutated in 31 patients (44%). VEN was added to the LIT regimen in 27 patients (39%), an FLT3i was added in four patients (6%), both an FLT3i and VEN were added (triplet regimen) in 13 patients (19%), and neither was added in 26 patients (37%). Details of the FLT3i drugs added and the specific regimens used are provided in Figure4. In total, 44 of 70 patients (63%) attained a CRc (for response details, see Figure4A). After a median follow‐up of 40 months (95% CI, 27.3–53.2 months), the median OS for the full LITFLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 70) was 10.9 months (95% CI, 5.5–16.1 months), and the median EFS was 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.6–8.8 months; Figure5A,B).

When stratified according to the addition of VEN and/or an FLT3i, a CRc was attained in 21 of 27 patients (78%) who received LIT + VEN, in zero of four (0%) who received LIT + FLT3i, in 11 of 13 (85%) who received LIT + VEN + FLT3i, and in 12 of 26 (46%) who received neither (Figure4B). The median OS for patients who received LIT + VEN, LIT + FLT3i, LIT + VEN + FLT3i, and LIT alone was 16.2, 5.85, 16.6, and 6.4 months, respectively (p= .1); whereas the median EFS for these groups was 5.6, 1.9, 10.4, and 4.2 months, respectively (p= .02).

When stratifying the LITFLT3‐TKDmutcohort byNPM1status, the LITNPM1wtgroup had fewer patients with diploid karyotype, and more patients with secondary AML and adverse‐risk mutations, includingTP53, ASXL1, andRUNX1(Table1). A CRc was attained in 23 of 31NPM1mutpatients (74%) and in 21 of 39NPM1wtpatients (54%; Figure4A). In addition,NPM1mutpatients had a longer median OS compared withNPM1wtpatients (median OS, 16.6 months [95% CI, 8.7–35 months] vs. 6.0 months [95% CI, 2.6–14 months], respectively; HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.32–0.98;p= .04) and trend toward a longer median EFS (10.4 months [95% CI, 4.2–17 months] vs. 2.7 months [95% CI, 1.8–5.3 months]; HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.35–1.01;p= .05; Figure5C,D).

Of the entire LITFLT3‐TKDmutgroup (n= 70), in total, only 10 patients (14%) underwent ASCT in first remission, in line with expectations for this older population, with median time to stem cell transplantation of 3.8 months (range, 2.7–5.5 months). For these patients, the median age was 65.5 years (range, 50–70 years), withNPM1co‐mutation in five patients (50%). On landmark analysis set at 3.8 months, there was no significant difference in median OS among patients who received ASCT compared with those who did not (median OS, NR [95% CI, 6.4 months to NR] vs. 35 months [95% CI, 14 months to NR], respectively; HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–1.5;p= .2; see FigureS3A). On stratifying byNPM1status, no OS benefit was noted with ASCT amongNPM1–co‐mutated patients. However,NPM1wtpatients who underwent ASCT had a trend toward longer median OS compared to those who did not undergo ASCT (median OS, NR [95% CI, 17 months to NR] vs. 15.1 months [95% CI, 4.4 months to NR], respectively; HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.03–1.5;p= .1; see FigureS3B,C).

Patients in theFLT3‐TKDmutAML cohort (n= 124) received frontline treatment from July 2012 to October 2023. Among these, 43 patients (35%) received frontline treatment from 2012 to 2016, and the remaining 81 patients (65%) were treated from 2017 to 2023 (see TableS2). In the 2012–2016 group, only five patients (12%) received either VEN or an FLT3i in combination with IC/LIT (all on clinical trial protocols). In contrast, 66 patients (82%) treated from 2017 to 2023 received either VEN and/or an FLT3i. This discrepancy likely reflects the greater use of VEN/FLT3i in frontline clinical trials during the latter time period as well as the subsequent regulatory approval of frontline FLT3i drugs for younger/fit patients with AML and VEN for older/unfit patients with AML.

In the entireNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort (n= 126), the median age was 67 years (range, 17–87 years), and 64 patients (51%) were female. Baseline characteristics are described in Table2. Frontline induction therapy was IC in 46 patients (37%) and LIT in 80 patients (63%).

In the ICNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML group (n= 46), the median age was 54 years (range, 17–74 years). VEN was added to IC in six patients (13%), and a CRc was attained in five of those six patients. IC alone was received by 40 patients (87%), and a CRc was achieved in 37 of those 40 patients (93%, all had a CR; see FigureS4).

With a median follow‐up of 72 months (95% CI, 47.6–98.6 months), the median OS for the ICNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort (n= 46) was 77.4 months (95% CI, 20.1 months to NR; 3‐year OS, 60%), and the median EFS was 39.5 months (95% CI, 12.4 months to NR; see FigureS5B,C). On stratifying by the type of induction therapy received, there was no significant difference in OS between patients who received IC + VEN versus IC alone (median OS, NR [95% CI, 1.3 months to NR] vs. 39.6 months [95% CI, 19 months to NR], respectively; HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.09–1.00; 3‐year OS, 83% vs. 57%;p= .2; see FigureS5A).

For the entire ICNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML cohort (n= 46), 19 patients (41%) underwent ASCT in first remission, and the median time to ASCT was 4.9 months (range, 1.9–9.2 months). For these patients, the median age was 54 years (range, 19–68 years). On landmark analysis, there was no OS benefit noted with ASCT (3‐year OS, 63% vs. 68% without ASCT;p= .8).

On comparing thisNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort with our priorNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 24; as mentioned above) who received IC, there was no statistically significant difference in OS (3‐year OS, 60% vs. 74%, respectively) or EFS (log‐rankp= .2 for both; seeFigure S5B,C).

In the LITNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort (n= 80), the median age was 72 years (range, 60–87 years). VEN was added to an LIT induction regimen in 34 patients (43%), with a CRc attained in 32 (94%). LIT alone was received by 46 patients (57%), with a CRc attained in 30 patients (65%; see FigureS6).

With a median follow‐up of 70 months (95% CI, 52.3–82.4 months), the median OS was 14.9 months (95% CI, 10.6–32.6 months; 3‐year OS, 40%), and the median EFS was 12.1 months (95% CI, 7.7–19.9 months; 3‐year EFS, 33%; see FigureS7B,C). On stratifying by the type of induction therapy, LIT + VEN improved the median OS compared to LIT alone in theNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort (median OS, 56 months [95% CI, 15 months to NR] vs. 11.5 months [95% CI, 5.6–16 months], respectively; 3‐year OS, 59% vs. 26%, respectively; HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8;p= .004; see FigureS7A).

In the LITNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML cohort (n= 80), eight patients (10%) underwent ASCT in first remission, with median time to ASCT of 5.4 months (range, 2.7–9.0 months). For these patients, the median age was 68.5 years (range, 62–72 years). On landmark analysis, there was no OS benefit with ASCT (3‐year OS, 75% vs. 62% without ASCT;p= .2).

When comparing the currentNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtcohort with our previousNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDmutcohort (n= 31), as mentioned above, there was no statistically significant difference in OS (3‐year OS, 40% vs. 32%, respectively) or EFS (log‐rankp= .9 andp= .7, respectively; see FigureS7B,C).

We describe one of the largest cohorts of patients with newly diagnosedFLT3‐TKDmutAML, with particular focus on the effect ofNPM1co‐mutation and the impact of contemporary therapies including, VEN and FLT3i drugs. Consistent with prior studies,NPM1was commonly co‐mutated in ourFLT3‐TKDmutAML cohort, with anNPM1co‐mutation in 44%, and was associated with an improved overall prognosis. The occurrence ofNPM1mutations in our cohort withFLT3‐TKDmutAML was associated with higher CRc rates from IC (100% vs. 67%;p= .001) and a trend toward higher CRc rates from LIT (74% vs. 54%;p= .09) compared with patients who did not haveNPM1co‐mutation. This translated into improved OS across both patients who received IC (3‐year OS, 74% vs. 40%;p= .03) and those who received LIT (3‐year OS, 32% vs. 16%;p= .04). It is important to highlight thatFLT3‐TKDmutAML without anNPM1co‐mutation was associated with particularly poor outcomes, with a median OS of only 13.8 months with IC regimens and 6.0 months with LIT regimens. It is noteworthy that such patients without co‐mutation also had enrichment of high‐risk features at baseline, such as secondary AML and adverse‐risk cytogenetics/mutations, which could partially explain the poorer prognosis.

Although our data indicate thatNPM1co‐mutation status may positively influence prognosis inFLT3‐TKDmutAML, the reverse did not hold true in our analysis as opposed to that seen by Bacher et al. Compared with patients who hadNPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDwtAML, the dual‐mutant (NPM1mut/FLT3‐TKDmut) patients did not have significantly different OS or EFS with either IC‐based or LIT‐based approaches. Therefore, the presence ofFLT3‐TKD mutation did not appear to positively influence prognosis further inNPM1mutAML but, rather, had a neutral impact in our analysis.

Next, we investigated how the incorporation of VEN and/or an FLT3i to IC or LIT regimens influenced outcomes in patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML. In the IC group, the addition of VEN led to a CRc rate of 94%, with improved EFS (3‐year EFS, 74% vs. 35%;p= .03) and a trend toward improved OS (3‐year OS, 74% vs. 42%;p= .07) compared with patients who received IC alone (without VEN). The addition of an FLT3i to IC also appeared to lead to longer EFS and OS, although this was not statistically significant, possibly because of the smaller numbers in this comparison. These data suggest that the addition of VEN or an FLT3i (especially VEN) to IC may improve outcomes in newly diagnosed patients with IC‐eligibleFLT3‐TKDmutAML.

In the LIT group, the addition of VEN led to high response rates (CRc rate, 78%) and a trend toward improved OS and EFS, although this was not statistically significant. This finding of a beneficial impact of incorporating VEN into IC or LIT regimens inFLT3‐TKDmutAML is not entirely novel. It was demonstrated previously that IC with VEN regimens is highly effective in the frontline setting of newly diagnosed AML across numerous molecular and cytogenetic subsets, including patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML, as previously published by our group.21,22,23Furthermore, the addition of VEN to HMA led to higher CRc rates (77% vs. 30%) and improved median OS (19.2 vs. 10 months) versus placebo with HMA among newly diagnosed patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML in the VIALE‐A study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifierNCT02993523).24,25Prospective randomized studies are ongoing (HOVON 501; EudraCT 2020‐004453‐71) and will hopefully confirm these observations from single‐arm studies. The 13 patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML in our LIT group who received triplet therapy (HMA, VEN, and FLT3i) had an impressive CRc rate of 85%, with a trend toward improved EFS compared with LIT alone (without VEN or FLT3i), but not compared with HMA + VEN, based on current follow‐up. Although highly interesting, the numbers and follow‐up of frontline, triplet‐treated patients who have AML (especially withFLT3‐TKD mutations) are relatively small and not sufficient to make definitive conclusions at this time.

We also studied the role of ASCT inFLT3‐TKDmutAML. TheFLT3‐TKDmutpatients who did not have anNPM1co‐mutation appeared to benefit the most from ASCT in first remission, with a significant improvement in OS compared with those who did not proceed to ASCT in the IC cohort and a trend toward improved OS in the LIT cohort. We believe that, currently, ASCT in first remission still should be recommended for such patients if they are otherwise candidates for ASCT. Conversely, the role of ASCT inFLT3‐TKDmutAML withNPM1co‐mutation was less clear. In both our IC cohort and our LIT cohort, such patients withFLT3‐TKDmut/NPM1mutAML who underwent ASCT in first remission did not have an OS benefit compared with those who did not undergo ASCT. Although a smaller sample size also potentially may be contributing to these results, we believe that role of ASCT in these patients needs to be studied further, and decisions regarding ASCT need to be made on an individualized basis. High‐sensitivityNPM1measurable residual disease testing by reverse transcriptase‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction, NGS, and polymerase chain reaction analysis–NGS approaches are increasingly becoming available and may help identify and further refine which frontline patients withNPM1mutAML are likely to benefit from ASCT in first CR.26,27Such measurable residual disease data are currently being generated on this cohort, and we hope to present them in a future analysis.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest analyses to date of frontline patients withFLT3‐TKDmutAML, the first to report outcomes ofFLT3‐TKDmutAML with contemporary therapeutic regimens incorporating VEN or FLT3I drugs, and the first to discuss the role of ASCT in this population, especially in the context of key biologicNPM1co‐mutation. Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and includes only patients from a single institution. In addition, patients received various different anthracycline‐cytarabine backbone‐based induction regimens based on the availability of frontline clinical trials or off‐trial regimens at the time of diagnosis. Finally, the sample sizes for some of the subgroup analyses, particularly those comparing different therapeutic regimens, are small given the relative infrequency ofFLT3‐TKD mutations in AML and may be underpowered for meaningful statistical comparisons. These results ideally need to be confirmed in future larger, multicenter, retrospective, and possibly prospective studies. Readers should interpret the study results within the context of these limitations.

In conclusion,FLT3‐TKDmutAML commonly harborsNPM1co‐mutation, which has key prognostic implications. Lack ofNPM1co‐mutation portends a poor prognosis in frontlineFLT3‐TKDmutAML, with lower response rates and inferior OS to both IC and LIT. Furthermore, the utility of ASCT inFLT3‐TKDmutAML may also depend onNPM1mutational status, with a clear OS benefit from ASCT observed in patients withNPM1‐nonmutated AML, but not in those withNPM1co‐mutation.
