Cervical cancer (CC) was a significant gynecological malignancy. Brachytherapy (BT) has found extensive application in cervical cancer radiotherapy, attributed to its remarkable features of high-precision positioning and highly conformal dose distribution. However, the field lacks a comprehensive bibliometric analysis. This research provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of cervical cancer brachytherapy trends and key topics, projecting future research directions.

A search was executed within the Web of Science Core Collection for publications on cervical cancer brachytherapy until 2025/6/23. Analytical tools were utilized to conduct in-depth bibliometric and visual analyses of the relevant online publications. The analyses covered multiple aspects, including countries/regions, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords.

A total of 2924 articles were analyzed, showing an upward trend. The USA was the most productive country, with the Medical University of Vienna leading in publications.Brachytherapyhad the highest number of publications. Tanderup K was the most prolific author, while Pötter R was the most frequently co-cited author. The latest high-frequency keywords included “cervical cancer,” “interstitial brachytherapy,” and “image-guided brachytherapy,” among others. Through keyword co-occurrence-based cluster analysis, 10 distinct clusters were generated, effectively highlighting the research hotspots and frontiers in cervical cancer brachytherapy.

With medical imaging informatics advancing, research on cervical cancer brachytherapy has become increasingly profound. Recently, areas such as image-guided-adaptive-brachytherapy, effective biological dose, and radionecrosis have attracted significant research attention. Future research is expected to focus on developing and enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) tools to optimize brachytherapy treatment planning, aiming to benefit a larger number of cervical cancer patients.

Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most prevalent cancer among women globally [1]. Statistical data reveal that in 2020, there were approximately 604,000 newly diagnosed cases of CC, resulting in 342,000 deaths [2]. Notably, 85% of these cases were concentrated in developing regions [3]. In these areas, due to the inadequacy of CC screening programs, many patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease [4]. CC not only poses a severe threat to patients’ lives but also significantly deteriorates their quality of life [5]. The associated physical and psychological burdens, including pain, bleeding, and fertility-related issues, have a profound impact on patients. Consequently, there is an urgent requirement to develop and improve treatment strategies for CC to enhance patients’ prognosis and quality of life.

Currently, the primary treatment modalities for CC include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy [6]. For early-stage CC patients (stage I-IIa), radical surgery is generally the treatment of choice. Conversely, radiotherapy-based non-surgical treatments are more commonly adopted for advanced-stage patients [7]. In radiotherapy, achieving effective tumor control necessitates higher radiation doses. However, traditional external beam radiotherapy is constrained by the radiation tolerance of surrounding normal tissues, making it arduous to deliver high-dose radiation [8]. This is where brachytherapy (BT) comes into play, which can precisely position an applicator or needle at the tumor site, enabling local delivery of high-dose radiation while minimizing damage to adjacent healthy tissues [9]. For patients with locally advanced CC, the combination of external beam radiotherapy, BT, and platinum-based chemotherapy has become the preferred treatment approach [10].

BT encompasses various forms, such as intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT), interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT), and radioactive seed implantation [11]. With the continuous evolution of BT technology, advancements like image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) and three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning systems have significantly enhanced the precision and safety of BT [12]. IGBT allows for real-time visualization and adjustment of the applicator position and radiation dose distribution, ensuring that the tumor receives the maximum radiation dose while reducing exposure to nearby healthy tissues [13]. As a result, the application of BT in CC treatment has become more widespread, driving the development of advanced CC treatment.

In the ever-evolving landscape of medical research, bibliometrics has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing scientific literature trends and identifying research hotspots [14]. Despite the significant progress and widespread acceptance of BT technology in CC treatment, there is a dearth of studies that comprehensively summarize the advancements in this area. Given the growing importance of BT in CC treatment, conducting a bibliometric analysis can not only uncover research trends and patterns over the past decade but also pinpoint major research hotspots and predict future research directions. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic literature on BT for CC treatment. This research evaluated the quantity and trends of published literature, the evolution of research topics and keywords, the contributions of major research institutions and authors, and the geographical distribution of research. Through bibliometric analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into the development trends of this field and offer a scientific basis for future research directions and decision-making.

This study conducted an exhaustive online literature search within the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), as depicted in Fig.1. The search period until June 23, 2025. The following search terms were employed: TS=(“cervical* cancer” OR “cervical cancer” OR “cervical carcinoma” OR “Uterine Cervical Neoplasms” OR “Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasm*” OR “cervical Tumor*” OR “cervical Malignant*” OR “CIN”) AND TS=(“Internal irradiation radiotherapy” OR “Endocurietherapy” OR “Sealed source radiotherapy” OR “Radium therapy” OR “Internal radium therapy” OR “Radioisotope Brachytherapy” OR “Curietherapy” OR “Intracavity Radiotherapy” OR “Radioisotope Plaque Therapy” OR “Implant Radiotherapy” OR “Interstitial Radiotherapy” OR “Surface Radiotherapy” OR “brachytherapy”). All retrieved articles were saved in text format, yielding a total of 3256 results.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) research focused on CC brachytherapy; (2) articles and review papers; (3) publications in the English language. The exclusion criteria were: (1) materials such as meeting abstracts, news items, and proceeding papers; (2) studies that are not related to BT for CC treatment. Two researchers independently read and screened the literature. In cases of disagreement, a third researcher was consulted for a final decision. Ultimately, 2924 publications were selected for further analysis.

To conduct in-depth data analysis, CiteSpace (6.1.6), VOSviewer (1.6.20), and the Bibliometrix R package (4.3.2) were utilized. Additionally, to ensure data quality and avoid including excessive marginal achievements, we conducted an analysis of institutions and authors with a publication volume of more than 5 papers. CiteSpace software was employed for keyword co-occurrence analysis, clustering, timeline visualization, keyword burst analysis, and dual-map overlay of journals. In the visual mapping generated by CiteSpace, the size of each node corresponds to the occurrence frequency of the associated item, with larger nodes indicating higher citation rates [15]. The connections between nodes represent collaborative or co-occurrence relationships. A node with a red outer ring indicates high betweenness centrality (centrality ≥ 0.1), suggesting that the node plays a crucial bridging role between other nodes, and thus, the analysis item it represents holds significant importance within the network [16].

VOSviewer software was mainly used to analyze collaborative interactions among countries and regions, as well as the citation and co-citation networks of journals and authors. In the visual maps created by VOSviewer, each node represents an item, such as a publication, an author, a country, or an institution [17]. The size of a node reflects the quantity of the item, while the color categorizes the item type. The thickness of the lines connecting nodes indicates the strength of collaboration or the frequency of co-citations between items. The R “bibliometrix” package explored research origins, country contributions, citations, geographical distributions, institution and author roles, journal features, and keywords [18]. Excel’s exponential growth function analyzed publication trends over time, offering insights into the research field’s development.

A total of 2924 papers that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved from the WoSCC database (Fig.2A). The number of published papers serves as an indicator of the annual changes and future development trends within a research field. As shown in Fig.2B, over the years, the number of publications has been on the rise, increasing from 59 in 2007 to 230 in 2024. Based on the model-fitting results, the cumulative publication volume exhibits an exponential growth trend (y = 121.93e0.1904x, R² = 0.9138). This trend indicates that the research scale in the field of BT for CC treatment is expanding continuously, and the research interest remains strong, demonstrating the high research value of this field.

A total of 97 countries/regions have contributed to the publications in this field. Among them, 56 countries/regions have published more than five articles each (Fig.3A). The United States (USA) ranked first with 669 publications, accounting for 22% of the total number of papers, thereby acting as the primary driving force in the development of this field. China followed with 450 publications (15%), Japan with 286 publications (10%), France with 165 publications (7%), and India with 163 publications (6%), as presented in Fig.3B. Moreover, 90 countries actively engaged in collaborative research. The visualized international collaboration network provides a clear picture of the production, distribution, and partnerships among these countries and regions (refer to Fig.3C and D). This network indicates significant global participation and collaborative efforts in the field. Notably, Austria had the highest total link strength and had close collaborations with the Netherlands, USA, Canada, and Slovenia, suggesting its crucial role in facilitating and maintaining international collaborations.

The majority of publications originated from 3167 institutions. The top 10 most active institutions are presented in Fig.4A. The Medical University of Vienna led with 126 articles, followed by the Aarhus University Hospital with 116 publications and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with 89 publications. It is worth highlighting that 393 institutions contributed at least 5 papers each, demonstrating their active involvement and significant contributions to the research field. The collaboration among these institutions is visualized in Fig.4B, which divides them into three distinct clusters based on different colors. The red cluster, consisting of 220 institutions centered around the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Gunma University, and the University of California, San Diego, stands out as the largest and most prominent. This clustering not only showcases the leading positions of these institutions in research but also reflects their close and productive collaborations. These data emphasize the crucial role of international cooperation in advancing research on CC brachytherapy.

A total of 341 journals have published research in the field of CC BT, with 81 journals having more than 5 publications each. The citation network is depicted in Fig.5A, and the co-citation network is shown in Fig.5B. In these figures, the node sizes represent the number of publications and co-citations, and the connecting lines denote citation and co-citation relationships. The top 10 journals published 1487 papers, accounting for 50% of all published papers (Table1). Brachytherapy led with 375 publications (13%), followed by the Journal of Contemporary Brachytherapy with 220 publications (8%). In terms of impact factors, the Journal ofInternational Journal of Radiation Oncology *Biology*Physicshad the highest value of 6.5, confirming the high quality of the top 10 journals. However, when considering total citation frequency and h-index,Radiotherapy and Oncology, with 10,034 citations, andInternational Journal of Radiation*Oncology*Biology Physics, with an h-index of 55, emerged as the most influential journals in the field.

Overlay dual mapping, a visual analysis method, was used to assess, compare, and contrast the characteristics of publication portfolios. This method helps to explore the interdisciplinary nature of research sources and targets and has been widely applied in bibliometrics [19]. Figure5C presents an overlay dual map of journals, with citing journals on the left and cited journals on the right. The colored paths represent citation relationships, and the two main reference paths are marked in green. The citing literature is predominantly concentrated in the medicine, medical, and clinical subject categories, while the cited literature mainly falls within the molecule, biology, genetics, health, nursing, and medicine subject categories.

A total of 11,763 authors contributed to the publications in this field. To better understand the citation and co-citation relationships among authors, an analysis was conducted on those who published more than 10 papers. The citation relationships are illustrated in Fig.6A, and Fig.6B shows a visual mapping of co-citation relationships among authors. In these maps, the node sizes reflect the number of publications and co-citations, respectively. Table2lists the 10 most productive authors. Tanderup K from the Department of Oncology at Aarhus University Hospital ranked first with 108 publications and an H-index of 40, followed by Haie-Meder C and Pötter R. Professor Tanderup K’s research group focuses on exploring dose optimization strategies in BT for CC treatment, such as MRI-guided brachytherapy and the integration of inorganic scintillation detectors with BT [20-[22]]. Notably, Pötter R had the most connections and was the most frequently co-cited author (7330). Other highly cited authors include Tanderup K, Haie-Meder C, and Kirisits C. These individuals have made significant contributions to the advancement of research and collaboration in the field, playing crucial roles in the academic discourse on CC treatment through BT.

Keywords play a crucial role in reflecting the core concepts and themes of publications, enabling researchers to understand the development trends and hot topics in specific fields [30]. In this study, a keyword co-occurrence network map was constructed, with keywords serving as nodes. The size of each node represents the frequency of keyword occurrence. The network consists of 704 nodes and 1314 connections, with a network density of 0.0053, as shown in Fig.8A. The 10 most frequently occurring keywords are: “cervical cancer” (1413), “interstitial brachytherapy” (184), “locally advanced cervical cancer” (152), “cervical carcinoma” (141), “radiation therapy” (135), “image-guided brachytherapy” (123), “intracavitary brachytherapy” (115), “high-dose-rate brachytherapy” (112), “endometrial cancer” (108), “uterine cervical neoplasms” (104). The close connections between nodes suggest that these areas are significant themes in the research field. Keywords such as “cervical cancer”, “interstitial brachytherapy”, “image-guided brachytherapy”, “radiation therapy”, “uterine cervical neoplasms”, and “intracavitary brachytherapy” have a centrality > 0.1, highlighting their crucial intermediary roles. Cluster analysis was performed using the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) algorithm based on the keyword co-occurrence network, generating a cluster map shown in Fig.8B. The study formed 10 clusters, with a modularity value (Q value) of 0.5821 (> 0.3) and a mean silhouette value (S value) of 0.873 (> 0.7). These values indicate effective and reliable clustering, which accurately reflects the research hotspots in the field [31]. The main research areas include: Cluster#0 (cervical cancer), Cluster#1 (endometrial cancer), Cluster#2 (locally advanced cervical cancer), Cluster#3 (deep learning), Cluster#4 (high-dose-rate brachytherapy), Cluster#5 (image-guided brachytherapy), Cluster#6 (uterine cervical neoplasms), Cluster#7 (radiation therapy), Cluster#8 (interstitial brachytherapy), Cluster#9 (intracavitary brachytherapy). These clusters cover a diverse range of topics, reflecting the multifaceted nature of contemporary research in this domain.

As depicted in Fig.8C, the top 24 terms with the highest citation bursts offer insights into the evolving research frontiers [32]. In the figure, blue lines denote time intervals, while red lines represent the duration of citation bursts. Terms like “cervical carcinoma”, “prognostic factor”, and “high dose rate brachytherapy” have completed their citation bursts. This suggests that their immediate relevance in the field has diminished. It is likely that these topics have reached a mature stage and are now regarded as fundamental knowledge rather than cutting-edge research areas. Conversely, terms such as “dose prediction”, “external beam radiotherapy”, “deep learning”, “radiation oncology”, “uterine cancer”, and “quality of life” are currently in the citation burst. These emerging terms not only reflect the current research hotspots but also suggest potential directions for future studies. For example, the integration of “deep learning” into “radiation oncology” and “dose prediction” indicates a growing trend of applying artificial intelligence techniques to enhance the precision and effectiveness of radiotherapy. This intersection of technology and medical treatment could lead to significant breakthroughs in personalized treatment plans, potentially improving patient outcomes. The presence of “quality of life” in the current citation also underscores the increasing emphasis on patient-centered research. Researchers are likely exploring more comprehensive approaches that not only target the treatment of the disease but also aim to maintain and improve the quality of life of patients during and after radiotherapy. Moreover, the sustained interest in “external beam radiotherapy” suggests that traditional treatment methods are still being actively refined and optimized. Scientists may be seeking ways to enhance the therapeutic ratio of external beam radiotherapy, reducing the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissues while maximizing the dose delivered to tumors.

The timeline map generated by CiteSpace software, based on keyword clustering, provides a comprehensive view of the research development in this field [33]. It captures the chronological progression of key research topics. Comprising 540 nodes and 949 connections, the timeline uses color-coded lines to represent the emergence time of each cluster (Fig.8). The size of each node reflects its frequency of occurrence, highlighting the significance of certain keywords over time. This timeline map not only showcases the breadth of research but also reveals its depth. It demonstrates a shift in research focus from “the clinical application of brachytherapy in cervical cancer treatment” to “the integration and innovation of brachytherapy with other therapeutic approaches, such as immunotherapy, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology” in Fig.9. This transition not only reflects the continuous innovation of treatment concepts but also highlights the role of technological advancements in driving progress within the field of oncology. For example, to maximize tumor control while minimizing harm to healthy tissues, researchers have combined the BT with concomitant chemoradiotherapy [34]. Due to its potential for tumor control and protection of normal tissues, concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become a preferred treatment option for CC.

This study employed bibliometric analysis to examine the literature on BT for CC treatment, aiming to clarify the current research status and offer guidance for future studies. During the research on BT for CC treatment, the global number of published scientific papers has increased significantly, indicating a growing research interest in this field. The United States is the most productive country, with 669 papers, and Austria serves as a key hub for international collaboration. The Medical University of Vienna leads in terms of publications, with 126 articles, demonstrating its significant influence. The journalBrachytherapyhas the highest number of publications in this area. Moreover, journals such as theInternational Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics, andRadiotherapy and Oncologycan be considered core journals in this field. Researchers are encouraged to closely follow the latest articles published in these journals. With the development of globalization and Internet-based medicine, cross-cultural collaboration and exchange have become increasingly important. In the future, national institutions and relevant researchers are recommended to strongly support multi-departmental, multi-center, and interdisciplinary collaborations to promote in-depth research in this field.

Based on keyword analysis, the current research hotspots in BT for CC treatment mainly revolve around “interstitial brachytherapy” and “image-guided brachytherapy”, among others. In recent years, research has increasingly focused on evaluating the safety and effectiveness of BT in treating CC patients. There is an emphasis on comparing different radiotherapy strategies to optimize treatment plans and improve patient survival rates and quality of life. For example, Richa Tiwari et al. found that for CC patients who cannot be effectively treated with intracavitary BT, the combined IC-ISBT technique with intrauterine tubes in perineal interstitial implantation can enhance local control rates and patient survival [35]. Additionally, as technology advances, researchers are exploring the application of emerging technologies such as image-guided adaptive BT, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and 3D printing in this field [36]-[37]. These technologies have the potential to improve treatment precision and patient comfort, further enhancing treatment outcomes. For example, in CC treatment, with the application of 3D image-guided brachytherapy (3D-IGBT) and MRI-guided brachytherapy has made treatment planning and delivery more accurate [39],[40]. These technologies not only improve treatment precision but also reduce damage to surrounding healthy tissues.

Keyword burst detection is regarded as an indicator of research frontiers or emerging trends evolving. In this study, “dose prediction,” “external beam radiotherapy,” “deep learning,” “radiation oncology,” “cervical cancer,” and “quality of life” were the keywords that continued to burst as of 2024. This finding indicates that the synergistic optimization of precision radiotherapy and patient quality of life in cervical cancer has become a recent research focus and is likely to remain a core area of research in the future. With the advancement of comprehensive treatment strategies for cervical cancer, the prolonged survival of patients has prompted clinicians to pay increasing attention to long-term functional preservation. Although study has confirmed that the standard brachytherapy (BT) regimen can improve the 5-year survival rate of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer to 72%, the impact of treatment-related toxicities (such as intestinal dysfunction and genitourinary injuries) on quality of life has not been fully quantified [34]. Furthermore, in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) integrated with big data, the intersection of deep learning and radiation oncology has demonstrated excellent performance in cervical cancer radiotherapy. AI-driven dose prediction models can enhance the dose delivery accuracy of brachytherapy by 20% by integrating patients’ MRI images and pathological features, while 2.5D neural networks (such as the InceptionResNetv2 architecture) improve the Dice similarity coefficient for cervical cancer target segmentation by 15%−20% compared with traditional manual contouring [41]. Such AI-driven tools reduce treatment planning time, enhance procedural consistency, and minimize toxicity by enabling personalized dose optimization [42]-[44]. Although AI-assisted radiotherapy planning has demonstrated clinical value, it still faces challenges such as insufficient multicenter data standardization and poor algorithm interpretability.

Looking ahead, future research endeavors are poised to focus on several key areas. These include developing biomarkers to guide personalized treatment decisions, optimizing radiotherapy dose fractionation schedules using AI-driven algorithms, and exploring novel combinations of brachytherapy with immunotherapies or targeted agents. Additionally, clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of emerging technologies, such as adaptive brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy, will play a crucial role in advancing the field. By addressing these frontiers, researchers aim to further enhance patient outcomes, reduce treatment toxicity, and ultimately redefine the landscape of cancer care.

Given the high incidence of gynecological tumors such as CC, effective treatment and reduction of their burden and occurrence rates are of increasing importance. Research shows that BT can improve survival rates and reduce recurrence in CC patients [45]. It also provides valuable insights for optimizing treatment protocols and enhancing patients’ quality of life. However, despite its effectiveness, the application of BT in CC treatment faces several challenges and limitations [46]. Firstly, BT requires highly precise technology and equipment to ensure the accuracy and safety of the treatment process. Secondly, it may cause a range of side effects and complications, such as radioactive cystitis and radioactive proctitis, which can negatively impact patients’ daily lives and long-term health. Therefore, during treatment, healthcare professionals must closely monitor patients’ physical responses and take prompt measures to relieve pain and discomfort. Additionally, BT is not suitable for all CC patients. For some specific types of CC or patients with severe conditions, BT may not achieve the desired therapeutic effect. To overcome these challenges, researchers are constantly exploring and improving BT techniques. For example, by introducing advanced image-guided technology, optimizing radiotherapy plans, and developing new radiotherapy equipment, the precision and safety of BT can be enhanced [47]. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals are strengthening patient education and health promotion to increase patients’ awareness and understanding of radiotherapy, facilitating better cooperation during treatment [48]. Moreover, when formulating treatment plans, healthcare professionals need to comprehensively consider patients’ specific conditions, including tumor type, stage, size, and physical condition, to develop personalized treatment plans [49].

This study has certain limitations. Firstly, the database search was confined to WoSCC (Web of Science Core Collection), excluding databases such as Scopus and PubMed. Although Scopus covers a broader range of disciplines (e.g., social sciences, engineering, and technology), its literature screening criteria are relatively lenient, potentially including more grey literature or non-core journals. While PubMed focuses primarily on biomedical fields, overlapping with WoSCC’s medical literature coverage while lacking interdisciplinary scope. To ensure consistency in literature quality, this study prioritized peer-reviewed core journal articles in WoSCC, avoiding quality deviations caused by inconsistent standards across multiple databases. For more comprehensive bibliometric analysis, future research is recommended to integrate multiple data sources. Secondly, the study only included English publications, potentially omitting important articles written in other languages. Incorporating non-English literature in future studies could yield more comprehensive and accurate conclusions. Thirdly, as literature searches relied mainly on article titles, abstracts, and keywords, the findings may not fully reflect all research in the field. Future research can expand the scope of reviewed studies through more thorough searches.

Overall, this study offers a comprehensive review of the development of BT for CC treatment. It enables future researchers to quickly identify the leading countries, institutions, and authors in the field. The study has not only identified numerous high-impact key terms but also analyzed their temporal information and scientifically predicted research hotspots and trends. Future research priorities may include in-depth exploration of the combination of BT with AI, personalized medicine, and early detection and prevention of radiation-related complications. These research areas are promising for advancing clinical practice and scientific understanding in the field, which is crucial for benefiting CC patients.
