In the study of gastric cancer (GC), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified and their functions have been partly characterized; however, the specific function of SPINT1 antisense RNA 1 (SPINT1-AS1) in GC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of SPINT1-AS1 in GC cells and elucidate its downstream molecular mechanisms.

SPINT1-AS1, microRNA-656-3p (miR-656-3p), and phospholipase C, X domain containing 3 (PLCXD3) levels were modulated in GC cells through transfection experiments. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were performed to assess SPINT1-AS1, miR-656-3p, and PLCXD3 levels. The proliferative capacity, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and oxidative stress levels of GC cells were evaluated using 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assays, and commercial kits, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted to assess the targeting relationships among SPINT1-AS1, miR-656-3p, and PLCXD3. The impact of SPINT1-AS1 on GC tumor growth was examined in xenograft tumor models.

SPINT1-AS1 and PLCXD3 were found to be downregulated in GC, whereas miR-656-3p was upregulated. SPINT1-AS1 elevation inhibited GC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and oxidative stress, and promoted apoptosis. SPINT1-AS1 knockdown had opposite effects. The pro-tumor effects induced by SPINT1-AS1 knockdown were reversed by concomitant knockdown of miR-656-3p. Similarly, the inhibitory effects of SPINT1-AS1 elevation on GC malignancy were abrogated by PLCXD3 knockdown. SPINT1-AS1 knockdown suppressed GC tumor growth in mice. SPINT1-AS1 competitively bound to miR-656-3p to mediate PLCXD3 expression.

SPINT1-AS1 suppresses GC malignancy through the regulation of the miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis. These findings provide robust data supporting the biological functions of lncRNAs in GC and offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Gastric cancer (GC) is characterized by a high degree of molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity [1]. Some risk factors, such as age and gender, are not modifiable, while others, such as smoking and H. pylori infection, are potentially modified [2]. GC patients experience improved prognosis with early detection, tumor reduction before surgery, surgical removal techniques, and post-surgery eradication [3]. Oxidative stress is the result when the production of reactive oxygen species surpasses the body’s capacity to neutralize them or repair the damage [4]. Increasing oxidative stress or preventing metabolic adaptation might offer greater benefits to cancer patients compared to antioxidants [5]. Therefore, considerable efforts must be made to grasp the potential of therapies targeting oxidative stress to better manage and control GC progression.

Genome-wide association studies have identified a vast array of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with cancer. The change of lncRNA expression and its mutation involves tumor progression, including but not limited to metastasis [6,7], stemness [8], posttranslational modifications, and energy metabolism reprogramming [9]. A large number of lncRNAs have been studied in GC, such as oncogenes lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 [10], lncRNA LINC00483 [11], antioncogenes lncRNA CRYM-AS1 [12], and lncRNA TPTE pseudogene 1 [13]. SPINT1 antisense RNA 1 (SPINT1-AS1) is seen as a key factor regulating drug sensitivity of tumor cells [14]. Furthermore, reports on human cancers have emphasized the action of SPINT1-AS1 in regulating tumor cell activities [15–17].

The interactions between lncRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) are often interrelated, so abnormal expression of any network component can disrupt complex regulatory pathways, ultimately leading to tumor development and progression [18]. Based on bioinformatics screening, miR-656-3p emerged as a downstream factor of SPINT1-AS1 and the focus of the study. miR-656-3p appears to exert tumor-suppressing effects in non-small cell lung cancer [19], colorectal cancer [20], and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [21]. To our best knowledge, there is little data indicating its role in GC.

This study examined the mechanism by which SPINT1-AS1 affects GC progression through the sequestration of miR-656-3p. Furthermore, it explored the participation of phospholipase C, X domain containing 3 (PLCXD3) in GC progression mediated by the SPINT1-AS1/miR-656-3p axis.

Human GC cell lines SGC-7901, BGC-823, MKN-28, MGC-803, and HGC-27 and normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 were obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Life Sciences Cell Center. Cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO₂. Short tandem repeat profiling was performed for cell authentication.

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SPINT1-AS1 and PLCXD3, as well as pcDNA 3.1 overexpression vectors for SPINT1-AS1 and PLCXD3, were utilized to silence or overexpress these genes, respectively. miR-656-3p mimics and inhibitors were employed to modulate miR-656-3p levels. All reagents were designed and provided by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). When MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells reached 70–80% confluence, transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the efficiency was assessed via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or Western blot analysis.

RNA was extracted from cells and tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by reverse transcription using PrimeScript RT Kits (Invitrogen). The RT-qPCR process utilized an Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Agilent Technologies), employing SYBR Green SuperMix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The conditions for thermal cycling were set: 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, with each cycle repeated over 40 cycles. The analysis of the data was conducted through the 2−ΔΔCttechnique, using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and U6 as internal reference genes. Every primer is itemized in Table1.

In each well of 24-well plates, cells were planted at 6 × 10⁴ cells/well. After achieving 60–70% confluence, cells underwent fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by blocking with 20 µL of pre-hybridization solution (Beijing Shengchuang Technology). Following this, cells underwent overnight incubation in darkness using Stellaris RNA FISH probes targeting SPINT1-AS1 (Biosearch Technologies, CA, USA). Post-hybridization, cells were washed with Wash Solutions I, II, and III at 42 °C, followed by staining with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution for 10 min. Ultimately, cells were prepared (BIH0252, BioRike, Hunan, China) and captured under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Cells (2 × 10⁴) were plated in 6-well plates and cultured for 14 days. Colonies were fixed with methanol for 20 min (Beyotime, Nanjing, China) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Beyotime). Colonies were then imaged using a microscope (Olympus).

Cell proliferation was assessed using the EdU assay kit (RiboBio). Cells, numbering 1 × 10⁴, were seeded in 96-well plates, left overnight, and then incubated with EdU solution (50 µM) at 37 °C for 2 h. They were subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and exposed to 2 mg/mL glycine for 5 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, cells were stained with Apollo reaction solution for 30 min. Following multiple washes with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were counterstained with Hoechst dye in the dark for 30 min. Imaging was performed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon).

Cells were subjected to trypsin digestion. The identification of apoptosis was conducted using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Annexin V-FITC/PI staining solution was prepared by mixing Annexin V-FITC, PI, and HEPES buffer in a 1:2:50 ratio. Around 1 × 10⁶ cells were reconstituted in 100 µL of the staining solution for a quarter-hour, succeeded by introducing 1 mL of HEPES buffer. Apoptosis was measured on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and examined using CellQuest software (version 5.1; BD Company).

Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using Transwell chambers. Matrigel-coated chambers (8 μm pore size; Corning, USA) were used for invasion assays, in contrast to uncoated chambers for migration assays. Cell suspensions (1 × 10⁵ cells in 500 µL of RPMI 1640 medium) were introduced into the upper chamber, while the lower chamber received 500 µL of RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Following a 24-hour incubation period at 37 °C, cells that traversed the membrane were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted manually under a 10 × microscope.

The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were measured using commercial kits (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Briefly, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and absorbance was measured [22]. Cellular MDA were detected using the MDA kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).

ROS levels were quantified using ROS detection kits (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Cells were cultured overnight in 96-well plates and incubated with 20 µL of 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for 45 min. ROS production was assessed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).

Protein was separated from cells or tissues using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (pre-cooled) on ice. Proteins were measured utilizing a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). The proteins underwent separation through polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were then moved onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA, USA), and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for an hour, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Post-washing, the membranes underwent a 1-hour room temperature incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (ab6721, Abcam). Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and their quantification was done with ImageJ software (version 1.50b; NIH, MD, USA). The primary antibodies used in this study were PLCXD3 (PA5-71235, Invitrogen) and GAPDH (ab8245, Abcam), GSK-3β (9315, Cell Signaling Technology), P-GSK-3β (Ser9) (9336, Cell Signaling Technology), Active-β-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (8814, Cell Signaling Technology).

To validate the direct targeting of SPINT1-AS1 and PLCXD3 by miR-656-3p, wild-type (WT) sequences of SPINT1-AS1 and PLCXD3 containing the predicted miR-656-3p binding sites were cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Promoter (E1751, Promega, USA), generating SPINT1-AS1-WT and PLCXD3-WT constructs, respectively. Corresponding mutant (MUT) sequences, in which the miR-656-3p binding sites were mutated, were similarly cloned into pGL3-Promega to produce SPINT1-AS1-MUT and PLCXD3-MUT constructs. As a negative control, the empty pGL3-Basic vector (E1750, Promega, USA) lacking any insert was included to assess baseline luciferase activity. These luciferase reporter constructs were co-transfected with miR-656-3p mimics (50 nM) or negative control (NC) mimics (50 nM) into MKN-28 and HGC-27 cell lines using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019, Invitrogen). The cells were lysed after a 48-hour incubation at 37 °C, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (E1960, Promega) on a GloMax 20/20 Luminometer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was standardized against Renilla luciferase activity, with results shown as relative luciferase activity relative to the pGL3-Basic control group.

RNase R (3 U/g, Epicenter) was used to treat RNA from MKN-28 cells overexpressing PLCXD3 (10 µg) by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, MALAT1 mRNA expression was detected by RT-qPCR.

RIP was performed using the Magna RIP kit (Millipore). Cells underwent lysis using 100 µL of RIP lysis buffer containing RNase inhibitor (Promega) and protease inhibitor (Roche). Post DNase I (Roche) application, the lysates got diluted using 900 µL of RIP immunoprecipitation buffer and were then treated with magnetic beads linked to antibodies (anti-Ago2, anti-IgG, and anti-PLCXD3). The beads underwent 6 washes using RIP wash buffer and were then subjected to proteinase K treatment at 37 °C for a duration of 30 min. The enhancement of RNA was examined using RT-qPCR.

Approval for all animal experiments was granted by the Animal Care Committee at Shaanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital. Ten 4-week-old female BALB/C nude mice were obtained from Guangdong Medical Experimental Animal Center. MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells stably knocking down SPINT1-AS1 (5 × 10⁶ cells per mouse) or not were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of the nude mice. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (length × width²) × 0.5. Tumor sizes were measured weekly with calipers. After four weeks, mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium, and tumors were excised for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of Ki-67 and PLCXD3 expression [23]. Three independent repetitions of the experiment were performed.

The maximum tumor size/burden permitted by the Ethics Committee is a volume of 2000 mm³. No mouse in this study exceeded this standard or the maximum tumor size/burden. At the end of the experiment, to alleviate the pain of the animals and meet the humane endpoint requirements, all mice were euthanized by inhalation of an overdose of anesthetic. All procedures were carried out by certified and skilled laboratory personnel. Animal carcasses were frozen in accordance with the institutional regulations.

Data were obtained from experiments performed three times. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student’s t-tests and one-way analysis of variance. The chi-square test was employed to assess the correlation between SPINT1-AS1 expression and clinicopathological features of GC patients. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

We assessed the expression levels of SPINT1-AS1 in GC cell lines. As depicted in Fig.1A, SPINT1-AS1 expression was lower in all five GC cell lines compared to GES-1, with the MKN-28 cell line exhibiting the lowest levels. The aggressive nature of the HGC-27 cell line was highly correlated with GC subtypes with poor clinical prognosis. Therefore, the MKN-28 and HGC-27 cell lines were subsequently selected for subsequent functional experimental analysis. FISH analysis revealed that SPINT1-AS1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells (Fig.1B and C). At the clinical level, based on the database analysis of TCGA, we found that SPINT1-AS1 in GC tissues was significantly lower than that in normal tissues (P= 0.00023) (Fig.1D). In addition, SPINT1-AS1 showed a lower level (Pr(> F) = 0.0147) as the TNM stage of GC patients increased (Fig.1E). In the TCGA database (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html), GC patients with high levels of SPINT1-AS1 exhibited better survival prognosis (Fig.1F). We further explored the potential upstream RBPs of SPINT1-AS1 by starbase (https://rnasysu.com/). As shown in Supplementary Table 1, SPINT1-AS1 potentially interacted with five RBPs. Among them, based on the analysis of GTEx and TCGA data, we only found that ELAVL1 was aberrantly expressed in GC (Fig.1G). These results indicate that SPINT1-AS1 is downregulated in GC and may play a role in its progression.

To elucidate the biological role of SPINT1-AS1 in GC, we transfected MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells with the pcDNA 3.1-based overexpression vector targeting SPINT1-AS1 to elevate its expression (SPINT1-AS1 was overexpressed 4.37-fold and 3.14-fold in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells, respectively) (Fig.2A). Subsequent proliferation was assessed using EdU and colony formation assays. Results demonstrated that SPINT1-AS1 elevation significantly decreased the proportion of EdU-positive cells and colony numbers (Fig.2B and C). Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase in apoptosis rates upon SPINT1-AS1 elevation (Fig.2D). Additionally, Transwell assays indicated that elevated SPINT1-AS1 levels impaired the invasive and migratory capabilities of GC cells (Fig.2E). Given that metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells often leads to elevated ROS and consequent oxidative stress—a hallmark of cancer progression, we investigated the impact of SPINT1-AS1 on oxidative stress in GC cells. SPINT1-AS1 elevation led to a significant reduction in ROS and MDA levels and an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px (Fig.2F and G). Collectively, these findings suggest that upregulation of SPINT1-AS1 inhibits malignant behaviors and mitigates ROS production in GC cells.

Next, we investigated miRNAs that interact with SPINT1-AS1. Utilizing the bioinformatics platform StarBase, we identified five candidate miRNAs predicted to bind to SPINT1-AS1. RT-qPCR revealed that three of these miRNAs were significantly upregulated in GC (Fig.3A). RIP assays were performed, which showed that only miR-656-3p was enriched with SPINT1-AS1 in Ago2-containing complexes (Fig.3B). SPINT1-AS1-WT/MUT were cloned into luciferase reporter vectors (Fig.3C). Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that co-transfection of SPINT1-AS1-WT with miR-656-3p mimics resulted in reduced luciferase activity, whereas SPINT1-AS1-MUT showed no such effect (Fig.3D). Furthermore, miR-656-3p expression was found to be elevated in all five GC cell lines compared to normal gastric epithelial cells (Fig.3E). SPINT1-AS1 elevation led to a significant downregulation of miR-656-3p (Fig.3F). These results indicate that SPINT1-AS1 functions as a ceRNA by sponging miR-656-3p.

To determine whether miR-656-3p is involved in SPINT1-AS1-mediated regulation of GC phenotypes, we co-transfected MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells with si-SPINT1-AS1 and miR-656-3p inhibitor. As depicted in Fig.4A, si-SPINT1-AS1 effectively reduced SPINT1-AS1 levels (The knockdown efficiency of SPINT1-AS1 in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells was 57% and 42%, respectively) and increased miR-656-3p expression. However, miR-656-3p inhibitor reversed the upregulation of miR-656-3p (The knockdown efficiency of miR-656-3p in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells was 72% and 70%, respectively). Functional assays revealed that silencing SPINT1-AS1 led to increased EdU incorporation and colony formation, indicative of enhanced proliferation, which was abrogated by miR-656-3p inhibition (Fig.4B and C). Flow cytometry demonstrated that SPINT1-AS1 knockdown decreased apoptosis rates, a reduction that was mitigated by inhibiting miR-656-3p (Fig.4D). Transwell assays showed that SPINT1-AS1 knockdown enhanced cell invasion and migration, effects that were reversed upon miR-656-3p inhibition (Fig.4E). Additionally, SPINT1-AS1 silencing resulted in elevated ROS and MDA levels and reduced SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, which were counteracted by miR-656-3p inhibition (Fig.4F and G). These findings suggest that SPINT1-AS1 modulates GC malignancy and oxidative stress through its interaction with miR-656-3p.

Next, we sought to identify mRNAs targeted by miR-656-3p. Using StarBase, we selected five candidate mRNAs predicted to interact with miR-656-3p and evaluated their expression levels in GC via RT-qPCR. Among these, only PLCXD3 exhibited significantly elevated expression in GC samples (Fig.5A), a result that was corroborated by data from the TCGA database (Fig.5B). RIP assays demonstrated that PLCXD3 and miR-656-3p were significantly enriched within Ago2-containing complexes, indicating a direct interaction (Fig.5C). To validate this interaction, PLCXD3-WT/MUT were cloned into luciferase reporter vectors (Fig.5D). Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that co-transfection of PLCXD3-WT with miR-656-3p mimics resulted in decreased luciferase activity, whereas PLCXD3-MUT showed no change (Fig.5E). Further expression analysis showed that PLCXD3 levels were lower in all five GC cell lines compared to normal gastric epithelial cells (Fig.5F). PLCXD3 expression was significantly lower in GC tissues than in normal tissue samples (P< 0.001) (Fig.5G), but PLCXD3 was not associated with TNM staging in GC patients (Fig.5H). Bioinformatics analysis also indicated that patients with low PLCXD3 expression had poor long-term survival in gastric adenocarcinoma (Fig.5I). Western blot analysis confirmed that promoting miR-656-3p suppressed PLCXD3 expression, while inhibition of miR-656-3p enhanced PLCXD3 levels (Fig.5J). These data demonstrate that miR-656-3p directly targets and regulates PLCXD3 expression.

To confirm the involvement of the miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis in SPINT1-AS1-mediated regulation of GC, rescue experiments were conducted. MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA 3.1-SPINT1-AS1 and si-PLCXD3. As shown in Fig.6A and B, SPINT1-AS1 elevation led to increased levels of SPINT1-AS1 and PLCXD3, while reducing miR-656-3p levels. The introduction of si-PLCXD3 effectively reversed PLCXD3 expression (PLCXD3 knockdown efficiency in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells was 50% and 58%, respectively). Functional assays demonstrated that overexpressing SPINT1-AS1 resulted in decreased EdU incorporation and fewer colonies, increased apoptosis, reduced invasion and migration, decreased ROS and MDA production, and elevated levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px). However, these effects were counteracted by si-PLCXD3 (Figs.6C–H). These results indicate that SPINT1-AS1 exerts its effects and modulates oxidative stress in GC through the miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 pathway.

Acknowledging the important influence of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and stemness, we hypothesized that the effect of the SPINT1-AS/miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis on the malignant phenotype of GC might be related to the blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To verify this conjecture, we further analyzed the changes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in GC by western blot. As shown in Fig.7A and B, SPINT1-AS overexpression significantly decreased p-GSK-3β (Ser9) and active-β-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) in GC, but did not have a significant effect on total GSK-3β protein. However, this effect was reversed by miR-656-3p mimic and si-PLCXD3, respectively. Subsequently, we further evaluated the effect of the SPINT1-AS/miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis on the Nrf2/HO-1 oxidative stress pathway. SPINT1-AS overexpression significantly reduced Nrf2 and HO-1. However, this effect was reversed by miR-656-3p mimic and si-PLCXD3, respectively (Fig.7C and D). These data suggest that SPINT1-AS inhibits Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β through the miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis, which in turn enhances GSK-3β activity, promotes phosphorylated degradation of β-catenin and reduces its intracellular accumulation. In addition, the SPINT1-AS/miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis reduced the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in GC, which may be due to the reduced need for Nrf2 activation in cancer cells after the reduction of ROS levels.

Next, we further investigated how PLCXD3 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. We first screened PLCXD3 for potential targets in the starbase database, and found that PLCXD3 binds to a variety of RNAs, among which MALAT1 is particularly critical. We showed that PLCXD3 could target the intronic region of MALAT1 (Fig.8A). MALAT1 has been shown to regulate oxidative stress in various diseases [24–26], and it can activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by inhibiting β-catenin degradation in cancer [27]. Based on this, we hypothesized that PLCXD3 inhibits this pathway by regulating MALAT1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed MALAT1 expression pattern in GC. The results showed that MALAT1 expression in five GC cell lines was higher than that in normal cell lines (Fig.8B), and the data from TCGA and GTEx databases also confirmed that the MALAT1 expression was higher in GC tissues than that in normal tissues (Fig.8C). Subsequently, we investigated the interaction of PLCXD3 with MALAT1. PLCXD3 overexpression decreased the resistance of MALAT1 RNA to RNase (Fig.8D), and RIP experiments showed specific binding of PLCXD3 to MALAT1 (Fig.8E). In addition, knockdown of PLCXD3 increased MALAT1 RNA expression, and overexpression of PLCXD3 decreased it (Fig.8F). These outcomes imply that PLCXD3 accelerates the degradation of MALAT1 RNA by diminishing its stability, with additional experiments verifying its effect on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. PLCXD3 overexpression significantly inhibited the levels of active-β-catenin and p-GSK-3β proteins, while MALAT1 elevation mitigated this inhibitory effect (Fig.8G). In summary, PLCXD3 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin activation by targeting MALAT1 and promoting its degradation.

To assess the in vivo impact of SPINT1-AS1 on GC tumor growth, we established a nude mouse xenograft model. Mice injected with SPINT1-AS1-overexpressing MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells exhibited significantly smaller tumor volumes and weights compared to controls, as shown in Fig.9A and C. IHC staining revealed that SPINT1-AS1 elevation led to reduced Ki-67 expression, a marker of proliferation, and increased PLCXD3 levels in the tumors (Fig.9D). These findings confirm that SPINT1-AS1 elevation effectively suppresses GC tumor growth in vivo.

Recent investigations have highlighted the aberrant expression of lncRNAs in GC, demonstrating their association with tumor progression, invasion, and prognosis. Despite significant advancements, the relationship between lncRNAs and GC continues to pose challenges, underscoring the necessity for further exploration of their complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we identified SPINT1-AS1 as a tumor suppressor in GC. Our findings reveal that SPINT1-AS1 exerts its anti-cancer effects by modulating the miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis, influencing key cellular processes including proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in GC cells.

Our results demonstrated a marked downregulation of SPINT1-AS1 in five GC cell lines compared to normal gastric epithelial cells, aligning with its tumor-suppressive role. This observation contrasts with reports of elevated SPINT1-AS1 expression in colorectal cancer, where it correlates with lymph node metastasis and relapse-free survival [28]. Such a difference may reflect the cancer-type-specific functions of SPINT1-AS1, a phenomenon that is well-accepted for lncRNAs. For instance, its decreased expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and invasive pituitary adenomas further supports its context-dependent anti-tumorigenic activity [29,30]. Functional assays in our study confirmed that SPINT1-AS1 elevation suppresses GC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while enhancing apoptosis and elevating antioxidant enzyme levels (e.g., SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px). Given that GC cells exhibit rapid proliferation accompanied by excessive ROS production—key drivers of angiogenesis and metastasis [31,32]—we propose that SPINT1-AS1 mitigates malignant behaviors by alleviating oxidative stress.

FISH revealed that SPINT1-AS1 predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm of GC cells, positioning it to act as a ceRNA. Cytoplasmic lncRNAs regulate downstream mRNA expression by sponging miRNAs [33]. Through dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays, we validated that SPINT1-AS1 competitively binds miR-656-3p, thereby upregulating PLCXD3 expression. Notably, miR-656-3p was found to be upregulated in GC, and its inhibition reversed the pro-tumorigenic effects of SPINT1-AS1 knockdown. Interestingly, while miR-656-3p exhibits tumor-suppressive roles in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer [19,20], its oncogenic behavior in GC suggests a tissue-specific regulatory profile, potentially driven by distinct microenvironmental cues or upstream regulators. This variability underscores the complexity of miRNA functions across cancer types. We explored potential crosstalk with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a key driver of GC progression. Bioinformatics analysis via StarBase indicated that PLCXD3 may interact with MALAT1, a lncRNA implicated in oxidative stress across multiple diseases [24–26]. We hypothesize that PLCXD3 binding to MALAT1 destabilizes its RNA structure, promoting degradation by RNases and subsequently reducing ROS production. Additionally, preliminary experiments showed that SPINT1-AS1 overexpression upregulates Nrf2 and HO-1, pivotal regulators of antioxidant defense, suggesting a broader oxidative stress modulation network that warrants further investigation.

PLCXD3, identified as a direct target of miR-656-3p, was consistently downregulated in GC cell lines and tissues, correlating with poor patient survival in the TCGA database. Its role as a tumor suppressor aligns with findings in stomach adenocarcinoma and lung cancer [34,35]. Mechanistically, this axis likely suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a pivotal pathway in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and stemness. SPINT1-AS1, by sponging miR-656-3p, elevated PLCXD3 expression, potentially enhancing GSK-3β activity through reduced inhibitory phosphorylation. Active GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, making it a target for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thereby reducing activation of the Wnt pathway. This regulatory cascade suggests a feedback loop where PLCXD3 amplifies the tumor-suppressive effects of SPINT1-AS1 by destabilizing β-catenin, a key oncogenic driver in GC. Concurrently, the axis appears to mediate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, a central regulator of oxidative stress response. By decreasing ROS levels in cells, SPINT1-AS1 may reduce the oxidative burden that normally triggers Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1-induced oxidation, thereby weakening the adaptive antioxidant defenses that maintain cancer cell survival under stress. This dual modulation of Wnt/β-catenin and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways positions the SPINT1-AS1/miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis as a multifaceted regulator of GC malignancy and redox homeostasis. Further deepening this mechanism, PLCXD3 likely exerts its effects by targeting MALAT1, a lncRNA known to bolster Wnt signaling by stabilizing β-catenin [27]. PLCXD3 may bind MALAT1, reducing its RNA stability and promoting its degradation, thereby indirectly suppressing Wnt/β-catenin activation. Given PLCXD3’s phospholipase C domain, it could also influence lipid signaling intermediates—such as phosphoinositides—that intersect with Wnt or ROS-generating pathways. These hypotheses highlight a complex molecular network where PLCXD3 integrates RNA-based and enzymatic functions to orchestrate tumor suppression, warranting future investigations into its lipid substrates and downstream effectors.

From a clinical perspective, the potential of SPINT1-AS1 as a biomarker for GC is compelling. Its significant downregulation in GC tissues, coupled with a negative correlation with tumor staging (P< 0.05) as observed in TCGA data, suggests that SPINT1-AS1 could serve as an indicator of disease progression. Similarly, the reciprocal expression patterns of miR-656-3p (upregulated) and PLCXD3 (downregulated) highlight their potential as part of a diagnostic or prognostic panel. To strengthen this premise, we expanded our cellular model to include the HGC-27 cell line, derived from undifferentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, which mimics aggressive, poor-prognosis GC subtypes like diffuse-type GC. The consistent tumor-suppressive effects of SPINT1-AS1 in HGC-27 cells reinforce its relevance across GC heterogeneity. However, the absence of direct clinical sample validation limits the immediate translational impact of these findings. While TCGA analysis provides preliminary support, large-scale studies correlating SPINT1-AS1, miR-656-3p, and PLCXD3 expression with patient survival and clinicopathological features are essential to establish their specificity, sensitivity, and clinical utility. Such efforts could also explore upstream regulators of SPINT1-AS1, such as transcription factors or epigenetic modifiers, to contextualize its dysregulation in GC.

In conclusion, our study delineates a novel tumor-suppressive role for SPINT1-AS1 in GC via the miR-656-3p/PLCXD3 axis, with significant implications for oxidative stress regulation and malignant behavior. The integration of MALAT1, Nrf2, and HO-1 into this network offers a more comprehensive view of its mechanistic underpinnings, while the inclusion of diverse cell lines and bioinformatics data lays a foundation for clinical relevance. Nevertheless, limitations such as the lack of extensive animal studies to dissect miR-656-3p and PLCXD3 independently, and the reliance on cell-line-based models rather than clinical cohorts, necessitate cautious interpretation. Future research should prioritize expanding in vivo models and validating these findings in diverse GC patient populations to unlock the full therapeutic and diagnostic potential of this regulatory axis.
