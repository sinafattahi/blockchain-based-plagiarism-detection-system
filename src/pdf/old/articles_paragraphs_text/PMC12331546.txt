To compare the efficacy and safety between thermal ablation combined with synchronous TACE and TACE in patients with liver metastasis of neuroendocrine tumors of different pathologic grades and different primary sites.

A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors in this study. The patients were divided into simultaneous ablation group and TACE group according to treatment mode and subgroups. The endpoints of prognosis were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

A total of 108 patients with neuroendocrine tumors were collected, including 46 patients in the simultaneous ablation group and 62 patients in the TACE group. According to WHO classification, 21 patients with G1 grade, 55 patients with G2 grade and 32 patients with G3 grade were included. The median OS and the median PFS showed no statistically significant differences between the TACE group and the simultaneous ablation group. Among G2 stage, the TACE group and the synchronous ablation group showed no difference in the median OS but statistically difference in the median PFS. For G1&2 stage patients, synchronous ablation showed longer median PFS than TACE. In pNET patients, although median OS showed no significant difference between the two groups, the synchronous ablation group achieved longer median PFS compared to the TACE group. Both the TACE group and the synchronous ablation group showed improved median OS in G1&2 stage patients relative to G3 stage patients.

Simultaneous ablation can delay disease progression in patients with liver metastasis of neuroendocrine tumors to a certain extent, and has a good safety, especially for patients with liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors of intermediate or low grade or pancreatic origin.

The incidence of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), which typically originate in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic and pulmonary bronchial trees, has steadily increased over the past 30 years, with 64,971 NET cases reported by the National Cancer Institute's SEER program. The incidence of the disease increased sixfold from 1.09/100,000 in 1973 to 6.98/100,000 in 2012. In China, the predominant primary sites of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) were the pancreas (31.5%), rectum (29.6%), and stomach (27%).

The 2019 WHO classification system is divided into NET and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) according to tumor differentiation, and GEP-NET is divided into 3 grades according to Ki-67 and mitotic image. Mitotic images < 2/2 mm2and Ki-67 < 3% are G1 (low grade); mitotic images < 2/2 mm2to 20/2 mm2; Ki-67 3% to 20% are G2 (medium grade); mitotic images > 20/2 mm2and Ki-67 > 20% are G3 (high grade).

Liver is the site of metastasis of NET, and about half of NET can have liver metastasis, up to 80% (Prete and Gonda2023). For patients with liver metastases where surgery is difficult, interventional therapy may be considered, including transarterial embolization (TAE), (transarterial chemoembolization, (Transarterial chemoembolization,). TACE), as well as transarterial radio-embolization (TARE) and non-vascular routes (cryogenic ablation, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation) (Rimbaş et al.2020), the more commonly used are TACE and thermal ablation. TACE mainly uses a catheter to inject an emulsion of iodide mixed with cytotoxic drugs (such as cisplatin or doxorubicin) into the supplying arteries of the lesion. The objective response rate of this therapy is 50% on average, and the symptom relief rate is about 75% (Rimbaş et al.2020). Ablation is generally applicable when the number of intrahepatic metastases is less than or equal to 4 and the maximum diameter of hepatic metastases is less than or equal to 3 cm (Rustagi and Farrell2014). Ablation can be used in percutaneous puncture of the lesion or in laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. TACE treatment was performed immediately after ablation. On the one hand, for large lesions, TACE could be used to treat the surviving parts after ablation. For multiple lesions, the use of ablation to inactivate part of the lesions and then TACE treatment can reduce the use of chemotherapy drugs and reduce the damage to the liver function of patients. On the other hand, arteriovenous fistula or bleeding may occur in some areas after ablation, and TACE can be used to treat these ablation-related complications in a timely manner. Therefore, in theory, simultaneous ablation combined with TACE can achieve better efficacy for large and multiple lesions, but there are few reports in the literature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of interventional therapy in patients with liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors and to explore which patients could benefit from simultaneous ablation combined with TACE, as reported below.

A total of 108 patients with liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors who underwent simultaneous ablation or TACE were included in the interventional therapy department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University from November 1, 2006 to December 31, 2022. The diagnostic criteria were as follows: percutaneous liver biopsy specimens or surgical specimens were confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. All patients underwent preoperative examination after admission to exclude surgical contraindications. The specific requirements for enrollment in this study were: (1) Patients with hepatic space-occupying lesions identified by preoperative enhanced CT and/or enhanced MRI imaging; (2) The source and grade of neuroendocrine tumor were indicated by percutaneous liver biopsy specimens or surgical specimens. (3) Before surgery, the patient had ECGO 0–1, Child–Pugh A level of liver function, and could tolerate interventional therapy.

The exclusion criteria of this study were as follows: (1) patients with atypical imaging findings or unclear pathological diagnosis of hepatic space-occupying lesions were examined before surgery; (2) Preoperative imaging could not evaluate the change of lesion size; (3) Patients with severe coagulation dysfunction (platelet count < 40*109/L); (4) Patients with serious cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular diseases who cannot tolerate surgery; (5) Patients refusing interventional surgery; (6) Allergy to contrast media.

A total of 108 patients were included and patient information was collected according to the admixture criteria (Table1). Enhanced abdominal CT was performed to re-examine the lesions within 3 months after simultaneous ablation or TACE treatment, and the lesions were identified as active by enhancement, and the therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the Revised Solid Tumor Efficacy Assessment (m-RECIST) (Desai et al.2009). This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (B2022-396R). The study was reviewed and approved by the hospital Ethics Committee and did not violate the social Code of Ethics or the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed written informed consent before surgery. Diagnostic criteria: percutaneous liver biopsy specimens or surgical specimens are confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical findings.

The patient was placed in a supine position, the right femoral artery or radius artery was used as a puncture point, and 2% lidocaine was placed under subcutaneous local anesthesia. The femoral artery or radius artery was punctured by the modified Seldinger method and a 5F sheath was introduced. Under the guidance of DSA, contrast agent was injected with a 5F catheter, and arteriography was performed through the abdominal trunk, superior mesenteric artery and phrenic artery to determine the blood-supplying artery of the tumor. According to the lesion staining, a microcatheter was used to superselect the tumor blood supply vessels, and the mixture of superliquefied iodide oil and chemotherapy drugs was injected into the blood supply vessels. Reangiography was performed to observe the tumor staining and the presence or absence of residual sites. 5–10 mL of superliquefied iodide oil was injected again, or gelatin sponge particles or blank microspheres were added if necessary to strengthen embolization. The process is repeated until the tumor stain disappears. In order to avoid severe postoperative liver function impairment, for patients with excessive liver tumor load (more than 70%), only unilateral liver lobe lesions were treated each time, and the remaining lesions were treated one month after surgery.

Arteriography was performed by peritoneal truncus, superior mesenteric artery, and diaphragmatic artery with the same preparation as TACE. According to the staining of the lesion, a microcatheter was used to select the blood supply vessels of the tumor for angiography. The puncture path was determined according to the preoperative image. Under local anesthesia or intravenous anesthesia, a 17-18G microwave ablation needle entered the lesion along the maximum diameter of the tumor body under the guidance of ultrasound, and 50-100 W power was used to ablate the lesion until it was observed that all the lesions were completely covered by the hyperechoic region and exceeded the tumor body by 0.5–1.0 cm under ultrasound. Subsequently, the angiography was performed again, and the mixture of chemotherapy drugs and ultra-liquefied iodized oil was gradually and slowly injected into the tumor blood vessels. This process is repeated until the tumor stain disappears, as with TACE. The operation ended with dressing and pressing the puncture. Vital signs are closely monitored for 24 h upon return to the ward. (Supplemenatal Fig. 1).

Both treatments were evaluated using the Modified Solid Tumor Efficacy Assessment (m-RECIST). This was assessed by comparing the change in the maximum diameter of the active lesion shown on the imaging examination before and after treatment. They were divided into four types: Complete response (CR): all target lesions disappeared with arterial phase enhancement; Partial response (PR): reduction of the maximum total diameter of the arterial phase of the target lesion by ≥ 30%; Stable disease (SD): the maximum size reduction of the target lesion did not reach PR or the maximum size increase did not reach PD; Disease progression (PD): an increase of ≥ 20% in the total maximum diameters of the arterial phase of the target lesion or the appearance of a new lesion. Postoperative serious complications are defined as surgery-related complications that occur within 30 days of surgery that lead to prolonged hospital stay, disability, or death.

Enrolled cases were divided into TACE synchronous percutaneous microwave thermal ablation synchronous arterial chemoembolization group and single TACE group, and the lesions were evaluated by postoperative imaging examination. The imaging evaluation of the lesions in the first postoperative review was evaluated by the surgeon and at least two imaging experts, and the patients were followed up until July 31, 2023, and the PFS and OS of the patients were calculated.

SPSS software (version 26.0) was used for data analysis. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and OS and PFS analyze and plot curves using Kaplan–Meier. The Cox regression model was used for univariate and multifactorial analysis. Factors withP< 0.1 in univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 108 patients with neuroendocrine tumors were retrospectively included, including 55 (50.9%) men and 53 (49.1%) women. 46 patients received TACE simultaneous thermal ablation and 62 patients received TACE. According to WHO classification, there were 21 G1, 55 G2 and 32 G3 patients. According to the primary site, 67 patients were located in the pancreas, and the rest were located in other gastrointestinal tract or lung. In terms of concurrent systemic therapy for liver metastases, 13 patients received Sanlong therapy, 14 patients received systemic systemic chemotherapy with different regimens, 7 patients received targeted therapy, 4 patients received combined therapy, such as targeted therapy combined with systemic chemotherapy/radiation therapy/endocrine therapy, and 1 patient received radiation therapy. The remaining 69 patients never received any systematic treatment. In this study, 40 patients had their primary sites surgically removed prior to treatment with liver metastases, and 68 patients had no primary sites surgically removed. Some patients had transient liver function injury after operation. No serious postoperative complications occurred in all patients.

Some patients had transient liver function injury after operation. No serious postoperative complications occurred in all patients.

At the end of follow-up, the mean PFS in the TACE group was 18.0 months (95%CI, 15.3–20.8 months), and the median PFS was 18.3 months (95%CI, 13.8–22.8 months). The mean PFS of the simultaneous ablation group was 31.9 months (95%CI, 20.6–43.2 months), and the median PFS was 19.0 months (95%CI, 13.0–24.9 months), with no statistical difference between the two groups (P= 0.134). (Fig.1). The violin diagram is similar to the Kaplan–Meier curve. (Supplemental Fig. 2).

The mean OS in the single TACE group was 72.3 months (95%CI, 51.65–93.02 months), the median OS was 46.8 months (95%CI, 31.17–62.43 months), and the mean OS in the simultaneous ablation group was 73.99 months (95%CI, 56.31–91.67 months).

There was statistical difference (P= 0.009). (Supplemental Fig. 3).

Of all patients treated with single TACE, 40 were G1/2 patients and 22 were G3 patients. In deviations of OS, the mean OS in the G1/2 group was 81.859 months (95%CI, 57.732–105.985 months) and the median OS was 48.0 months (95%CI, 11.558–84.442 months). The mean OS of G3 patients was 32.712 months (95%CI, 19.956–45.468 months), and the median OS was 25.0 months (95%CI, 0.0001–54.445 months), with statistically significant difference between the two groups (P= 0.039). (Fig.4).

Of all patients treated with synchronous ablation, 36 were G1/2 patients and 10 were G3 patients. In terms of OS, the mean OS in the G1/2 group was 78.494 months (95%CI, 59.960–97.029 months) and the median OS was 63.0 months (95%CI, 12.655–113.345 months). The mean OS of G3 patients was 26.740 months (95%CI, 10.702–42.778 months), and the median OS was 17.0 months (95%CI, 11.534–22.466 months), with statistically significant difference between the two groups (P= 0.039). (Fig.5).

Of the 67 pNETs cases, 38 received TACE treatment, of which 20 died during the follow-up period. The mean survival time was 68.835 months (95%CI, 42.943–94.727 months), and the median survival time was 46.8 months (95%CI, 33.010–60.590 months). Of the 29 patients who underwent synchronous ablation, 12 died during the follow-up period. The mean survival time was 80.598 months (95%CI, 59.046–102.149 months) and the median survival time was 111.0 months (95%CI, 34.871–187.129 months). There was no significant difference in median OS between the two groups (P= 0.161).

Among all pNETs cases, 25 patients in the single TACE group developed progression during the follow-up period. The mean PFS was 21.599 months (95%CI, 16.953–26.246 months), and the median PFS was 22.0 (95%CI, 11.577–32.423 months). Progression occurred in 17 patients in the simultaneous ablation group during follow-up, with a mean PFS of 43.996 months (95%CI, 28.791–59.2 months) and a median PFS of 32.0 months (95%CI, 24.952–39.048 months). The median PFS in the simultaneous ablation group was higher than that in the single TACE group, and the difference was statistically significant (P= 0.025). (Fig.6).

Multivariate analysis showed that the CA-199(p= 0.045) is the independent predictor of OS; primary lesion site (P= 0.001), Alb (P< 0.030) and CEA (P< 0.006) were independent predictors of PFS (Table2).The significantpvalues have been signed out.

Pancreas is the most common primary site of GEP-NEN in China, accounting for about 31.5% (Rustagi and Farrell2014), while liver is the best site for metastasis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. For patients with liver metastasis, the treatment strategy is a major clinical difficulty. At present, there are few studies on the local treatment of liver metastases in neuroendocrine tumors. There are many treatments for liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors, including surgery, drug therapy, and interventional therapy. Surgery is considered to be the preferred treatment for patients with NEN liver metastases. However, resection of liver metastases has a larger wound surface and a high postoperative metastasis rate, with a recurrence rate as high as 76% reported in literature (Desai et al.2009). Drug treatment mainly includes somatostatin drugs, chemotherapeutic drugs and molecular targeted drugs with good efficacy and safety that can significantly prolong patients’ PFS. Clinically, for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine liver metastases that cannot be surgically resected with G1/G2, drug therapy combined with interventional therapy of liver lesions is usually adopted in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TACE and simultaneous thermal ablation in the treatment of NET liver metastases.

Most liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors are rich in blood supply, and the blood supply is mainly from the hepatic artery. Compared with TAE, TACE can not only embolize but also have the effect of local chemotherapy. At the same time, due to the decrease in blood flow velocity after embolization, it is helpful for chemotherapy drugs to stay at the embolization site and prolong their action time at the embolization site. However, the drug release of TACE is uncontrollable. The patients included in our study used epirubicin, cisplatin, mitomycin C, etc. (Rinke et al.2012), but there has been no literature report on which drug can be applied to TACE to achieve the greatest benefit for patients, and there is a lack of randomized clinical trials (Ramage et al.2019).

At present, ablation therapy mainly includes RFA, MWA, cryoablation and so on. All patients who underwent simultaneous ablation in our study were treated with microwave ablation. Compared with other thermal ablation methods, MWA has a faster heating rate and higher temperature and can produce a large ablation area in a short time (Ramage et al.2019; Ribeiro et al.2024).

Some foreign scholars have found that the objective response rate of NET liver metastasis patients receiving interventional therapy is 74% (Ribeiro et al.2024). The main factors affecting patients’ OS are the site of the primary lesion, the size and number of liver metastases, and the interventional therapy used (Testoni et al.2020). This is also consistent with our findings. However, due to the small sample size or the fact that most patients adopted cTACE and the mode of interventional surgery was relatively uniform, the mode of surgery was not reflected as an independent predictor of PFS or OS.

Previous studies retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of MWA in patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer. A total of 115 patients were included in this study. The average diameter of liver metastases was 3.1 cm, and the cumulative survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery were 98.1%, 87.1% and 78.7%, respectively (Pozzari et al.2018). A systematic review analyzed the efficacy of TACE in liver metastases of breast cancer, and the results showed that the median overall survival of patients was 7.3–47 months and the median disease-free survival was 2.9–17 months, indicating that TACE treatment is an effective alternative for patients with liver metastases of breast cancer (Demirkan and Eriksson2012). For TACE synchronous microwave ablation, there is currently no clear definition in the world, and the conventional TACE treatment is performed immediately after ablation, completing the “point” and “surface” combined with inactivated metastases. Intraoperative TACE imaging can detect some small lesions that can not be detected by enhanced CT or enhanced MRI, and these lesions can be treated with timely embolization. TACE treatment was performed immediately after ablation. On the one hand, for large lesions, TACE could be used to treat the surviving parts after ablation. For multiple lesions, the use of ablation to inactivate part of the lesions and then TACE treatment can reduce the use of chemotherapy drugs and reduce the damage to the liver function of patients. On the other hand, arteriovenous fistulas or bleeding may occur in some areas after ablation, and TACE can be used to treat these ablation-related complications in a timely manner. Therefore, in theory, simultaneous ablation combined with TACE can achieve better efficacy for large and multiple lesions. Vogl et al. retrospectively analyzed the effect of interventional therapy on patients with breast cancer liver metastasis in their center in the past 26 years (Burns and Edil2012). There were 143 patients in the MWA combined TACE group, and the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 77%, 38% and 22%, respectively, while there were 549 patients in the TACE group. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 37%, 8% and 4%, respectively, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P< 0.001). Wu et al. retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of MWA combined with TACE in patients with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, and the results showed that the objective response rate was 83.4%, the median PFS was 5 months, and the median OS was 11 months. (Prete and Gonda2023) The researchers also grouped the patients according to the tumor load of liver metastases. Subgroup analysis showed that the median OS of patients with tumor burden ≤ 25% was 33.1 months, and that of patients with tumor burden 26%–50% and > 50% was 14.7 months and 6.1 months, respectively (Rimbaş et al.2020). It can be concluded that TACE combined with ablation has a better curative effect than TACE alone. For neuroendocrine tumors, Kitano et al. analyzed the effectiveness and safety of TACE for liver metastasis of neuroendocrine tumors, and the study results showed that the median OS was 28 months and the 1-year, 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 76%, 54% and 26%, respectively (Nadalin et al.2022). The prospective study results of Martin et al. showed that the median OS for MWA alone in the treatment of NET liver metastases was 18 months and the median disease-free survival was 8 months. Gao Shanshan et al. retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of MWA combined with TACE in the treatment of gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and the results showed that the median OS and PFS of the whole group were 34 months and 25 months, respectively, and the 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 95% and 84%. Ma Jianbing et al. retrospectively analyzed the therapeutic effect of TACE on hepatic metastasis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. A total of 25 patients with G2-grade pNET were included in the study, with a median PFS of 13 months and a median OS of 18 months. Zhang Chao et al. discussed the efficacy of TACE in patients with pNET liver metastasis whose primary pancreas had been removed and included 21 patients, whose average PFS was 16.6 months, median PFS was 13 months, average OS was 28.0 months, and median OS was 25 months. In this study, the median OS of 59 months in the MWA synchronous combined TACE group was higher than that of 46.8 months in the TACE group, and the difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.465), which may be related to the small sample size. The median PFS in the MWA concurrent TACE group in this study was 19 months, higher than 18.3 months in the TACE group. The above results were slightly higher than other studies, which may be due to the high compliance of our patients, some of whom received systemic therapy, and our close follow-up.

WHO 2019 GEP-NEN classification is divided into 3 grades according to Ki-67 and mitotic image. With the increase in pathological grade, the malignancy of the tumor also increases. Zhang Minghui et al. retrospectively analyzed the pathological characteristics and prognosis of digestive system NET, and the results showed that the incidence of vascular cancer embolus, muscular infiltration, nerve invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis increased with the increase of pathological grade, and correspondingly, the survival rate of patients also gradually decreased (Touzios et al.2005). The study results of Gao Shanshan et al. showed that the median OS of patients with G3 grade decreased significantly compared with G1 and G2 grade (P= 0.019). Dhir et al. analyzed the efficacy of TACE in patients with unresectable NET liver metastases, and the median OS was 62 months in G1/2 and 17.3 months in G3 (P< 0.001). This is consistent with the results of the present study, in which the median OS among patients treated with TACE was 48.0 months in grade G1G2 and 25.0 months in grade G3 (P= 0.022). The analysis of grade G1G2 patients in this study showed that the median PFS in the simultaneous ablationgroup was 28.0 months, which was longer than that in the TACE group (18.0 months), with statistical significance (P= 0.009). For lesions with G1/2 grade and abundant blood supply, the benefit was obvious after simultaneous ablation. In this study, only 4 patients with G3 grade received synchronous ablation, so for their analysis, it also suggests that we need to further verify whether G3 patients with NET liver metastasis can benefit from synchronous ablation.

This study has the following limitations: First, this study is a single-center retrospective study, which has certain bias in patient selection, and relevant information may have certain discrepancies during follow-up visits. Future multicenter prospective studies are needed to validate our findings. Secondly, due to the small number of cases included in this study, the reliability of statistical results in subgroup analysis may be insufficient due to the small number of cases. Moreover, only 4 patients in grade G3 received simultaneous ablation therapy, making it difficult to analyze the difference between the effect of TACE and simultaneous ablation in this group of patients.

In summary, patients with hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin and those with liver metastases of G1 and G2 WHO received MWA in combination with TACE had better benefits than those with TACE alone.
