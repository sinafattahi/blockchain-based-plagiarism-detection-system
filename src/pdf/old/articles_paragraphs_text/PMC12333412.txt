Imidazol-2-ylidenes, IPr and IMes, represent by far the
most important
and widely utilized N-heterocyclic carbenes in organic synthesis and
catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis, catalytic activity, and
structural and electronic characterization of ImPyDippDipp and ImPyMesMes,
sterically bulky and easily accessible biaryl L-shaped N-heterocyclic
carbene analogues of IPr and IMes. These ligands exploit the rigid
imidazo­[1,5-a]­pyridin-3-ylidene architecture to merge
the properties of the biaryl scaffold with the electron-rich characteristics
of the carbene center. The catalytic activity is evaluated in the
gold­(I)-catalyzed hydration of alkynes and cyclization N-propargylamides,
two model reactions for π-activation of alkynes that have found
broad application in organic synthesis. Structural and electronic
evaluation indicates that biaryl L-shaped ImPyDippDipp and ImPyMesMes
ligands are more sterically demanding and more electron σ-donating
and π-accepting than the classical imidazol-2-ylidnes, IPr and
IMes. Both of these L-shaped ligands show excellent catalytic activity
in gold­(I)-catalyzed hydration of alkynes and cyclization of N-propargylamides
compared to their imidazol-2-ylidene congeners, IPr and IMes. Considering
the tremendous impact of imidazol-2-ylidenes in homogeneous catalysis,
we anticipate that this class of biaryl L-shaped NHCs will be rapidly
and widely adopted to complement IPr and IMes N-heterocyclic carbenes.

carbene ligands. (B) Design of sterically demanding, biaryl L-shaped
N-heterocyclic carbene analogous of IPr and IMes.

Inspired by our continued interest in N-heterocyclic
carbenes and
ligand development and being aware of
the advances in NHC design−and the tremendous success of biaryl-shaped phosphine ligands, we aimed to develop biaryl sterically hindered
and strongly σ-electron-donating NHC ligands (FigureB).,In
general, the most broadly utilized imidazol-2-ylidenes, IPr and IMes,
feature an umbrella-shaped architecture around the metal center, owing
to the spatial distribution of N-aromatic wingtips. This in turn leads
to lower rigidity, providing limited steric protection and restricting
their potential scope of applications. In contrast, the vertically arranged biaryls have been among the
most successful ligand design paradigms in the last decades, offering
enhanced steric shielding and improved metal stability. Based on this concept and considering the highly
appealing features of sterically restricted N-heterocyclic carbene
ligands, herein, we report the synthesis,
catalytic activity, and structural and electronic characterization
of ImPyDippDipp and ImPyMesMes, sterically bulky and easily accessible
biaryl N-heterocyclic carbene analogues of IPr and IMes (FigureB). Structural and electronic evaluation indicates that these
biaryl L-shaped ImPyDippDipp and ImPyMesMes ligands are more sterically
demanding, more electron σ-donating, and π-accepting than
the classical imidazol-2-ylidnes, IPr and IMes. Both of these biaryl
L-shaped ligands show excellent catalytic activity in gold­(I)-catalyzed
hydration of alkynes and cyclization
N-propargylamides compared to their imidazol-2-ylidene
congeners, IPr and IMes. We anticipate that this class of biaryl L-shaped
NHCs will find broad application to complement IPr and IMes N-heterocyclic
carbenes.

At the outset, ImPyDippDipp
and ImPyMesMes were selected as the
structural analogues of the most popular IPr and IMes imidazol-2-ylidene
N-heterocyclic carbenes. The syntheses of ImPyDippDipp·HCl and
ImPyMesMes·HCl are outlined inScheme. Starting from the commercially available
6-bromopicolinaldehyde (1), 2-bromo-6-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)­pyridine
(2) is obtained by the reaction with ethylene glycol
in the presence ofpTsOH and sodium sulfate. Next,
Ni-catalyzed Kumada cross-coupling between (2) and the
in situ prepared Grignard reagents (ArBr, magnesium, catalytic amount
of I2) afforded biaryl intermediates3–4catalyzed by Ni­(PCy3)2Cl2. Condensation with 2,6-diisopropylaniline or 2,4,6-trimethylaniline
in the presence of formaldehyde and HCl in dioxane afforded the desired
ImPyDippDipp·HCl and ImPyMesMes·HCl salts in one pot. The
desired products are readily obtained by trituration with diethyl
ether/ethyl acetate as white solids, obviating the need for chromatographic
purification. Note that the same route can be used for the synthesis
of both ImPyDippDipp·HCl and ImPyMesMes·HCl, attesting to
the generality of the approach.

With access to ImPyMesMes·HCl
(5) and ImPyDippDipp·HCl
(6), we next comprehensively evaluated the steric properties
of these biaryl L-shaped imidazo­[1,5-a]­pyridin-3-ylidene
ligands. As shown inScheme, gold­(I) complexes, [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl] (7) and
[Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] (8), were prepared using KOtBu in THF. These Au­(I)–ImPy
complexes (7) and (8) were found to be stable
to air and moisture. Complexes (7) and (8) were characterized by X-ray crystallography (Figuresand ). Previous studies by Cavallo, Nolan, and co-workers
demonstrated that the combination of the % buried volume (%Vbur) and steric maps of linear [Au­(NHC)­Cl] complexes
are the best indication for quantifying the steric impact of NHC ligands.,In our case, both [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl] and [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] are
linear (7: C–Au–Cl, 178.10°; C–Au,
1.977 Å;8: C–Au–Cl, 179.3°;
C–Au, 1.998 Å). The (%Vbur) of [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] is 48.8%, while the (%Vbur) of [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl] is 43.4%, indicating an increase
in steric demand for the ImPyDippDipp ligand. These values can be
compared with the (%Vbur) of 40.3% and
34.4% determined for the analogous imidazol-2-ylidenes, [Au­(IPr)­Cl]
and [Au­(IMes)­Cl, indicating a significant increase of steric contribution
rendered by the vertical biaryl vs the umbrella-shaped N-wingtip.

Importantly, the crystallographic analysis of [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl]
and [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] revealed a spatially distinct, unsymmetrical
biaryl quadrant distribution (7: SW 50.4%, NW 50.4%,
NE 36.4%, SE 36.4%) and (8: SW 42.1%, NW 42.1%, NE 55.5%,
SE 55.5%) for each quadrant (Figure). These values further indicate a unique enhancement
of the steric impact of ImPyMesMes and ImPyDippDipp as compared to
the classical IPr and IMes by the steric quadrant distribution: [Au­(IPr)­Cl]
(SW 40.3%, NW 40.3%, NE 40.3%, SE 40.3%) and [Au­(IMes)­Cl] (SW 34.4%,
NW 34.4%, NE 34.4%, SE 34.4%). This biaryl steric arrangement can
provide an important steric differentiation of the biaryl fragment
combined with the flexibility of the N-aromatic wingtip by merging
vertical aryl and umbrella-wingtip topology.

To gain insight into the electronic properties
of these biaryl
L-shaped ImPy N-heterocyclic carbenes, HOMO and LUMO energy levels
were determined at the B3LYP 6-311++g­(d,p) level (Figure). The HOMO of ImPyDippDipp
(−5.97 eV) is slightly higher than IPr (−6.01 eV), and
the LUMO of ImPyDippDipp (−1.33 eV) is lower than IPr (−0.48
eV), indicating ImPyDippDipp is a stronger σ-donor and π-acceptor.
Likewise, the HOMO of ImPyMesMes (−5.86 eV) is higher than
that of IMes (−5.90 eV) and LUMO of ImPyMesMes (−1.24
eV) is lower than that of IMes (−0.33 eV). Furthermore, the
HOMO values of [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] (−5.90 eV) and of [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl]
(−5.84 eV) are higher than those of [Au­(IPr)­Cl] (−6.21
eV) and [Au­(IMes)­Cl] (−6.14 eV). Finally, the Wiberg bond orders
of [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] (Au–C(carbene), 0.6224;
Au–Cl, 0.5526) and [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl] (Au–C(carbene), 0.6459; Au–Cl, 0.5916) can be compared with [Au­(IPr)­Cl]
(Au–C(carbene), 0.6287; Au–Cl, 0.5504) and
[Au­(IMes)­Cl] (Au–C(carbene), 0.6607; Au–Cl,
0.6026), indicating comparatively strong Au–C(carbene)bonds in the imidazo­[1,5-a]­pyridin-3-ylidene ligands.
Thus, these biaryl L-shaped ImPy NHC ligands are characterized by
strong σ-donation and π-acceptance in combination with
vertical biaryl and flexible umbrella steric bulk, which makes these
ImPy–NHC ligands well-suited for Au­(I) catalysis.

Next, we evaluated the catalytic activity of these
biaryl L-shaped
Au­(I)–ImPyNHC complexes (Schemesand ). Gold­(I)-catalyzed
hydration of alkynes and cycloisomerization of N-propargylamides have
been selected as model reactions owing to their importance in organic
synthesis and catalysis as well as the well-defined effect of sterically
demanding NHC ligands on these two reactions in that the reactions
are ineffective in the absence of significant steric demand of the
ligand. In particular, the seminal 2009 study by Nolan and co-workers
demonstrated a remarkable effect of steric hindrance in Au­(I)–NHC-catalyzed
hydration reactions in that [Au­(IPr)­Cl] promoted the reaction in high
yields at 120 °C, while the less sterically demanding [Au­(IMes)­Cl]
was completely unreactive.

We next evaluated the reactivity of these biaryl L-shaped
ligands
in gold­(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of N-propargylamides (Scheme). Previous studies demonstrated that similar to the hydration
of alkynes, IMes-based catalysts are ineffective in this cycloisomerization.
We selected this reaction owing to the utility of oxazolines in various
areas of medicinal chemistry research. Preliminary control experiments
demonstrated that [Au­(IPr)­Cl] afforded low yields of the model cyclization
(<15% yield, 0.5 mol %), which can be compared with 80% yield obtained
using [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl] (7) and 50% yield using [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl]
(8) under the same conditions. In general, both complexes
[Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl] (7) and [Au­(ImPyDippDipp)­Cl] (8) show similar activity in this amide cycloisomerization.
The less sterically demanding ImPyMesMes is slightly more reactive
than the ImPyDippDipp-based catalyst. For example, complex (7) afforded a 90% yield of12e, while the yield
using complex (8) was 65%. This cyclization proceeded
smoothly with electron-deficient and electron-donating groups to afford12b(99%),12d(91%),12c(99%),
and12e(90%). Furthermore, the complex [Au­(ImPyMesMes)­Cl]
(7) was very active for the substrates containing two
α-methyl groups (12f, 87%;12g, 99%;12h, 95%). Overall, the high steric demand of these biaryl,
L-shaped ImPy ligands results in high activity in Au­(I)-catalyzed
hydration and cycloisomerization reactions and bodes well for future
applications of this family of ligands in Au­(I) catalysis as valuable
counterparts of the classical IMes and IPr ligands.

In summary, we have reported the synthesis,
catalytic activity,
and characterization of gold­(I) complexes of ImPyDippDipp and ImPyMesMes,
two sterically demanding biaryl, L-shaped N-heterocyclic carbenes
that are structural analogues of the two most popular imidazol-2-ylidenes,
IPr and IMes. These ImPyNHC ligands feature vertically arranged biaryl
architecture merged with a half-umbrella shaped N-wingtip that provides
a well-defined catalytic pocket around the carbene center. The parent
ligands are readily accessible in a simple, cost-effective, three
synthetic steps. This straightforward and operationally simple synthetic
pathway mirrors the ease of access to IPr and IMes and is one of the
key requirements for broad adoption of new ligands by the synthetic
community. Evaluation of structural and electronic properties provided
insight into the steric impact, σ-donation, and π-accepting
properties. These biaryl L-shaped ligands are more sterically demanding,
more σ-donating, and π-accepting than the traditional
imidazol-2-ylidenes. Both ligands showed excellent catalytic activity
in the gold­(I)-catalyzed hydration of alkynes and cycloisomerization
of N-propargylamides. The approach with vertical aryl arrangement
in a rigid imidazo­[1,5-a]­pyridin-3-ylidene architecture
provides an enticing avenue for the future development of novel sterically
defined carbene ligands. Given the tremendous importance of N-heterocyclic
carbenes in homogeneous catalysis, we expect that this class of biaryl
ImPyNHCs will find widespread adoption as counterparts to the classical
IPr and IMes.
