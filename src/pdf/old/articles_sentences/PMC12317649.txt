Pyridox(am)ine 5′‐phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency is an ultrarare inherited neurometabolic disease, characterized by primarily neonatal‐onset B6‐responsive epileptic encephalopathies.
Treatment often requires sustainable access to high‐quality pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate (PLP, i.e., active vitamin B6), although some patients (also) respond to pyridoxine (PN).
While PN is authorized as a medicinal product, PLP is not, and this forces reliance on lesser‐regulated food supplements, which risks dosing inaccuracies.
This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness and safety of PLP in PNPO deficiency (PROSPERO, CRD42024542199).
A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, andClinicalTrials.gov, with risk of bias assessed and observational evidence summarized using a narrative synthesis approach.
A total of 30 studies were included reporting on 49 patients treated with PLP.
Clinical seizure responsiveness following PLP therapy was observed in the majority of patients (n= 38, 77.6%) and PLP treatment significantly improved survival (p< 0.001) compared with untreated siblings with a similar phenotype.
The majority of PLP‐responsive patients responded exclusively to PLP, with PN being attempted but ineffective in most of them (n= 30/33, 90.9%) Liver toxicity was the most frequently observed adverse event (n= 10, 20.4%) and although the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, it may be associated with high‐dose PLP.
Therefore, regular liver disease screening is recommended during PLP therapy.
This means that PLP remains the only effective therapy for achieving and maintaining seizure control in the majority of PNPO deficient patients, but the therapeutic window for optimal management is narrow.
Thus, it is essential to ensure patient access to high‐quality and appropriate forms of PLP.
Vitamin B6‐responsive epileptic encephalopathies are a group of rare inherited neurometabolic diseases characterized by early‐onset epileptic seizures resistant to common antiseizure medication(s) (ASM) but responsive to vitamin B6 vitamers.
Despite the seeming simplicity of vitamin therapy, a lack of access to high‐quality pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate (PLP)—the active form of vitamin B6—is known to complicate effective treatment [1,2].
Vitamin B6 consists of six interconvertible compounds, all sharing a central pyridine ring, with PLP and its precursor pyridoxine (PN) being of particular clinical importance [3].
PLP is an essential cofactor for numerous enzymatic reactions that include neurotransmitter synthesis and degradation, which explains why several inherited vitamin B6 disorders manifest with a predominantly neurological phenotype [4].
The enzyme pyridox(am)ine 5′‐phosphate oxidase (PNPO, EC 1.4.3.5) plays a key role in catalyzing the oxidation of phosphorylated forms of vitamin B6 to produce PLP [5].
In PNPO deficiency (OMIM #610090) this enzyme is dysfunctional due to pathogenic variants in thePNPOgene, resulting in a phenotype characterized by PN or PLP‐responsive neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE) [5,6].
PN is widely available as a medicinal product, authorized by regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
It is often effective for managing seizure disorders related to vitamin B6 metabolism, such as pyridoxine‐dependent epilepsy (PDE‐ALDH7A1, OMIM #266100) [7].
However, a review by Alghamdi et al. found that in 36% of PNPO patients, PN was not effective, and another 20% showed only a transient or incomplete response to PN [8].
In most PNPO patients, following neonatal epilepsy guidelines, PN therapy is initiated before PLP for seizures unresponsive to conventional ASM [9].
If PN fails, PLP is almost always needed, despite the fact that PLP is not authorized as medication.
This lack of authorized PLP medicinal products results in PNPO deficient patients depending on PLP food supplements to achieve seizure control, despite significant concerns about their appropriateness and reliability for this medical purpose [1,2].
This is particularly concerning, as PLP treatment necessitates strict dosing control: minor reductions or delays may result in seizures, whereas higher doses have been linked to liver toxicity [10,11].
Regulations for food supplements are usually less strict than those for medication, particularly concerning purity, concentration, and safety [2,12].
This reality also means PLP is not included in the regulatory or clinical monitoring systems that exist for authorized medication, and mechanisms to evaluate the long‐term safety of high‐dose treatment are lacking.
We summarized all available data on the efficacy and safety of PLP in PNPO deficiency by conducting a systematic review of the literature to assess the unmet need for a PLP treatment option of reliable quality and accessibility [13].
This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (CRD42024542199) [14].
Studies were included in this systematic review if the efficacy and/or safety of PLP in any dose were reported in patients with PNPO deficiency.
As PNPO deficiency was first recognized as the cause of PLP‐responsive epilepsy in 2005, studies published before that year were excluded [6].
Patients with vitamin B6‐responsive epileptic encephalopathy who underwentPNPOgene sequencing but had negative results were excluded, but cases with a single identified variant in thePNPOgene were included.
Only studies with original data published in peer‐reviewed journals were included.
Conference abstracts and studies in non‐English languages were excluded.
A comprehensive search using controlled terms and free text terms for the concepts (1) PLP (including its abbreviations and different spellings) and (2) PNPO deficiency (including its abbreviations and different spellings) or (3) its clinical presentation, for example, epileptic encephalopathy (or similar terms, including epilepsy, seizures) was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases and in the clinical trial registry databaseClinicalTrials.gov.
The search was performed on 15 April 2024.
We also performed a hand search of reference lists of included studies and reviewed relevant articles mentioned in excluded reviews for potentially relevant case reports.
In the Supporting InformationS1, the complete search strategy is presented.
The identified records were imported into the reference management tool Endnote (X9.2; Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) and duplicates were removed.
Titles, abstracts, and the subsequently obtained relevant full‐text articles were independently evaluated for eligibility by two reviewers per article (N.D.R.
and N.N.S.)
for eligibility using Rayyan (Qatar Computing Research Institute, Doha, Qatar) [15].
The assessment of methodological quality and risk of bias was also conducted independently by two members of the data extraction team (L.v.D., N.D.R., and N.N.S.
); any discrepancies were resolved via discussion.
The tool developed by Murad et al. was utilized to assess risk of bias for case reports and case series [16].
Baseline characteristics, PLP therapy details (e.g., age of initiation, daily dose, dose adjustments), duration of follow‐up, and outcomes were extracted independently by two reviewers per study (L.v.D., N.D.R., and N.N.S.).
A standardized extraction form in Castor EDC (Castor v2023.4.4.0) was used to facilitate this, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion.
Seizure responsiveness to PLP therapy was assessed on a 5‐point scale (no response, complete cessation, improvement, stabilization, worsening).
Developmental outcomes were categorized based on the classifications provided by the authors of each publication.
Adverse events were scored according to the definitions of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0; no grading was applied.
Data were processed and analyzed using Excel and R version 4.3.1.
Kaplan–Meier curves and a log‐rank test were employed in subgroup analyses to assess survival rates.
A total of 1049 studies were identified through the literature search.
After removing 265 duplicates, 782 studies were screened on title and abstract (Figure1).
Of these, 80 studies were selected for full‐text review and 30 met the inclusion criteria [2,6,10,11,13,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41].
Reasons for exclusion are shown in Figure1.
All 30 included studies were either case series or case reports; 2 (6.6%) were considered low risk, 15 (50%) moderate risk, and 13 (43.3%) high risk of bias (see Supporting InformationS1for an overview).
Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis flow diagram.
A total of 49 patients with PNPO deficiency were reported to have been treated with PLP.
Sex was documented for 47 patients, with the majority being male (n= 33, 70.2%).
For 45 patients, biallelic variants in thePNPOgene were reported.
In four patients, a single heterozygousPNPOvariant was found [2,21,31,36].
Age of onset was recorded for 48 patients, with one patient treated before the appearance of symptoms because of a prior PNPO deficiency diagnosis in a sibling [28,31].
The median age of seizure onset was day 1 of life (range 0.5 h to 17 months) and the median age at last follow up was 3 years (range 48 days to 21 years).
The duration of PLP use was recorded for 27 patients with a mean of 3 years (range 6 days to 11 years).
In a total of 38 patients (77.6%) PLP therapy was reported to be effective (see Table1for an overview).
In 27 patients PLP therapy led to complete seizure cessation (with the possible exception for seizures occurring during febrile illness) while another 10 patients showed an improvement in seizure frequency.
The one presymptomatic patient who received PLP therapy from birth achieved complete seizure control, apart from two seizures at 10 and 11 months old [28].
The median PLP dosage (including dose adjustments) for PLP‐responsive patients was 35.5 mg/kg/day (range: 10–74) and the median age of PLP initiation was 30 days (range: 0 day to 19 years).
The effectiveness of PLP in achieving adequate seizure control in PNPO deficiency is further supported by the fact that 26 (68.4%) of the patients who responded to PLP received monotherapy.
Additionally, in 12 patients a dose–response effect related to PLP was reported.
These reports included dose increases that reduced seizure frequency as well as seizure recurrences at the end of a dose interval.
In another 7 patients, a challenge–rechallenge effect occurred, with seizure recurrence following PLP withdrawal.
Abbreviations: PLP, pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate; PN, pyridoxine.
Seven patients (14.3%) did not demonstrate a clinical response to PLP therapy.
One patient showed no response, while 6 patients experienced an increase in seizure frequency after switching from PN to PLP (see Table2for an overview) [22,29,31,34].
All of these patients had biallelicPNPOvariants.
Limited data were available on the characteristics of PLP therapy in these patients: PLP dosage was reported for only 2 of 7 patients, and age at initiation was documented for 4.
PNPO deficiency patients with no PLP response or worsened seizures after PN to PLP switch.
Abbreviations: —, no response; +, good seizure response; ±, partial or transient seizure response; ↑, seizure increase following switch from PN to PLP; NA, not applicable; NR, not reported; PLP, pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate; PN, pyridoxine.
In four additional patients, the clinical seizure response to PLP therapy was unclear.
One child started on PLP (50 mg/kg/day) while already in poor condition due to ongoing seizure activity and multiorgan dysfunction briefly improved following PLP therapy but died after his condition deteriorated and seizures recurred [13].
In two twins with poor seizure control on PN, switching to PLP caused an initial increase in seizures, followed by stabilization at a seizure frequency comparable to the frequency on PN.
They were switched back to PN due to persistent vomiting and loss of appetite attributed to PLP use [29,30,41].
Finally, one patient experienced refractory status epilepticus when PLP therapy was first introduced and the existing PN therapy was tapered [32].
PN therapy and three ASM were reinstated, but seizure control remained poor.
Two years later, seizure control improved with the addition of PLP (10 mg/kg/day) and riboflavin to the treatment regimen, which already included PN and three ASM.
In the majority of PLP‐responsive patients, a PN trial was also attempted (n= 33, 86.8%) [2,6,17,18,21,23,24,25,26,27,29,30,31,33,35,36,38,39,40,42].
Most of these patients, however, did not achieve adequate seizure control following PN therapy (n= 30, 90.9%): 20 patients showed no response, 4 had an initial response followed by seizure recurrence, and 6 experienced partial control with breakthrough seizures.
Two patients did have a favorable response to PN monotherapy.
One of these patients was switched to PN after experiencing gastrointestinal side effects (vomiting, epigastric pain) during PLP therapy.
Another patient was treated with PN, but this treatment was discontinued for unknown reasons, and the patient was then restarted on levetiracetam following seizure recurrence, with PLP therapy initiated following PNPO deficiency diagnosis [21,23].
In one patient, the response to PN therapy was unclear [25].
Five of the seven patients who did not show PLP‐responsiveness achieved good seizure control on PN therapy.
A partial response to PN was observed in one patient, who is maintained on PN and levetiracetam, though occasional seizures persist [29].
Lastly, in one patient, adequate seizure control was not achieved with either PN or PLP, and this patient died [22].
Developmental outcomes in PLP‐responsive patients on monotherapy were assessed to evaluate the impact of PLP on development (see Table3.)
The level of development was reported for most of these patients (n= 24).
Normal neurodevelopment was documented by the reporting authors for 10 (41.7%) of these patients, 6 (25.0%) showed a minor to moderate delay, and a severe delay was noted for 8 (30.3%) patients.
For one additional patient, a delay was noted without specification of its severity [2].
For the patients with normal neurodevelopment to moderate developmental delays, PLP appears to have been initiated earlier (Table3.)
than for the patients with a severe delay.
It should be noted, however, that the age of PLP initiation was only documented for half of the patients with a severe delay on PLP monotherapy.
For 6 of the 10 PLP monotherapy patients with normal neurodevelopment, PLP therapy was initiated in the neonatal period.
This was true for only one patient with a severe delay.
Developmental outcomes in PLP‐responsive patients on monotherapy.
Death was reported in three PLP‐treated patients.
Two of these patients had undergone unsuccessful PLP trials and were on PN therapy at the time of death.
The first of these patients, who passed away on the 56th day of life, suffered from seizures that did not improve with trials of PN (100 mg IV), PLP (30 mg/kg/day), or ASM [22].
The second patient died of therapy‐resistant seizures at 8 years of age [29,30,41].
It is unclear if the third deceased patient, with poorly controlled seizures despite a transient EEG response to PLP (50 mg/kg/day, initiated at 23 days old), was still on PLP therapy at the time of death, which was due to a fungal infection at 48 days amid multiorgan dysfunction [13].
For 9 patients included, previous siblings had exhibited comparable convulsive symptoms but did not receive PLP (because the diagnosis of PNPO deficiency was not yet established) [6,17,18,27,31,34].
The impact of PLP treatment on survival was evident: of the siblings who did not receive PLP, 10 died, with survival times available for 9 (median age at death 32.6 days, range 7 days to 7 months).
In contrast, their PLP‐treated siblings treated with PLP survived (p< 0.001, with ages at last follow‐up available for 7 siblings).
Seizure control was achieved with PN therapy in the only surviving sibling from the untreated group, while three of the deceased siblings had also received PN therapy without effect [18,34].
Adverse events were reported in 15 patients on PLP therapy (30.6%, see Table4).
The most frequently reported adverse events related to liver toxicity, with elevated transaminases reported in 10 patients (20.4%).
Nine of these patients had been on long‐term PLP therapy (> 1 year).
In two of these patients, liver cirrhosis occurred and was confirmed by liver biopsy [10,11].
Both patients required high‐dose (50–100 mg/kg/day) PLP therapy to maintain seizure control and had been on PLP for several years before cirrhosis developed.
In one other patient, acute liver failure was reported and related to CMV‐related hepatopathy [31].
Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was initiated, and elevated transaminases have since persisted.
An additional 8 gastrointestinal adverse events were reported (vomitingn= 4, feeding difficultiesn= 3, epigastric painn= 1).
Three instances of PLP administration difficulties were noted, which related to the required intake of a high volume of PLP in two cases [2,26].
In one patient, PLP intoxication occurred due to unclear labeling of a PLP food supplement, resulting in an unintended dosage of 74 mg/kg/day [2].
In another, somnolence was reported on a PLP dose of 50 mg/kg/day, which improved following a dose reduction [24].
In one patient with mild hemophilia type A in addition to PNPO deficiency, an increase in bleeding symptoms was noted [20].
This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of PLP in patients with PNPO deficiency.
The findings suggest that PLP therapy effectively achieves and maintains seizure control in most PNPO deficient patients and significantly improves survival compared with untreated siblings with a similar phenotype.
Nearly all patients with PLP‐responsive seizures were dependent on PLP, as their seizures did not respond to PN therapy.
The therapeutic window for effective PLP treatment seems narrow, with reports of seizure recurrence at the end of a dosing interval or following a single missed dose, potentially exacerbated by PLP supplements with unreliable dose accuracy [1].
However, dosing increases must be considered carefully, as there is evidence that long‐term and high‐dose PLP usage is associated with hepatotoxicity.
Despite this risk, for PNPO deficiency patients with PLP‐responsive but PN‐resistant seizures, at present, PLP remains the only viable treatment option; the prognosis for patients with an insufficient response to both PN and PLP appears to be poor.
Not all patients with PNPO deficiency responded favorably to PLP therapy.
In most instances, this manifested as an increase in seizure frequency following the transition from PN or the tapering of PN in favor of PLP.
These patients may have specificPNPOmutations that make them more responsive to PN than PLP, which has been proposed for the c.674G>A (p.Arg225His) variant [34].
However, most of the studies reporting these cases lacked sufficient detail on PLP therapy, making it difficult to discern whether these seizures were truly unresponsive or if inadequate PLP therapy, such as suboptimal dosing and administration frequency, contributed to a poor response.
Another limitation of this study relates to the association between PLP therapy and developmental outcomes.
While PLP‐responsive patients with normal neurodevelopment appear to have been treated early, approximately one‐third of patients exhibited severe developmental delays, including one case where PLP therapy was initiated as early as day 5 [2].
Isolating PLP therapy‐related effects on development from other factors that may have contributed to poorer developmental outcomes, such as prior seizures and encephalopathy in infancy, is challenging.
Additionally, this review did not include data on other potential influences, such as pre‐ and perinatal complications (fetal distress, premature birth) [8].
The most common side effect of PLP therapy was hepatotoxicity, reported in one in five cases and ranging from elevated transaminases to cirrhosis.
Worryingly, there are (yet unpublished) reports of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in PNPO deficiency patients on long‐term PLP therapy [43].
30% of pediatric HCC cases arise in the context of chronic liver conditions, including cirrhosis and metabolic disorders, as well as chronic viral hepatitis or cholestasis [44,45].
Since PLP is not authorized as a medicinal product, there are no established safety monitoring systems, and the reporting of such (serious) adverse events relies heavily on case reports published by individual clinicians.
This introduces the possibility of underreporting.
In this review, the mean duration of PLP usage documented was three years, which may prevent the identification of long‐term adverse effects such as cirrhosis and, potentially, HCC.
The mechanism responsible for the liver toxicity observed is not yet known.
A single case of hepatoxicity linked to high‐dose PLP in a boy with homocystinuria perhaps suggests this may be attributable to PLP therapy rather than the inherent pathological mechanisms of PNPO deficiency [46].
It has been hypothesized that PLP metabolites or PLP degradation products may be the cause of liver toxicity, which might also relate to the insufficient quality of PLP food supplements for PNPO deficiency patients.
Coman et al. posed that high‐dose PLP may trigger an abnormal, fibrogenic response in hepatic stellate cells via purinoceptor activation and thereby contribute to cirrhosis [11].
The high chemical reactivity of PLP may also be of toxicological relevance.
PLP can non‐enzymatically modify metabolites and proteins by forming Schiff bases and inducing epimerization, both of which can alter protein structure and function [47,48].
It also reacts with lysine residues [49].
Acetaldehyde, a similarly reactive aldehyde, has been shown to impair Δ4‐3‐oxosteroid 5β‐reductase in the liver through lysine modification, leading to toxic metabolite accumulation and hepatic injury [50].
PLP may likewise impair critical hepatic enzymes, indicating a broader role in aldehyde‐mediated toxicity.
Another potential mechanism involves PLP degradation by intestinal bacteria, which typically synthesize B6 vitamers but may break down excess PLP into α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds [4,51].
In tyrosinemia type 1 (OMIM #276700), fumaryl acetoacetate accumulation, another α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compound, is linked to cirrhosis and HCC [52].
Alternatively, Mohamed‐Ahmed et al. suggest that 4‐pyridoxic acid 5′‐phosphate (PAP), a product of PLP (photo)degradation normally absent in humans, could inhibit PLP‐dependent enzymes and thereby play a role in hepatotoxicity [1].
The potential for PLP degradation is increased by the common practice of dissolving capsules or crushing tablets before administration to pediatric patients [1,2,11].
This administration method also increases the risk of dosing errors, as not only the dose accuracy but also the solubility of PLP food supplements can vary [1].
Overall, these findings demonstrate strong observational evidence for the effectiveness of PLP therapy in PNPO deficiency, while also showing the potential for hepatotoxicity that may be linked to high‐dose PLP.
PNPO deficiency is in the minority of treatable IMDs, but patients require continuous, reliable, and precise dosing within a small therapeutic window to prevent life‐threatening seizures.
Therefore, there is an urgent and unmet medical need for a high‐quality PLP product [1].
Authorization of PLP as a medicinal product would ensure dose accuracy as well as expand safety monitoring [53].
A report of incidental rectal PLP administration raises the possibility of developing alternative PLP formulations that would theoretically bypass the hepatic first‐pass metabolism, which may decrease the risk of therapy‐related liver injury [11].
Alternatively, an extended release formulation might be able to reduce the daily PLP dosage while maintaining therapeutic levels.
More precise dosing evaluation may also help optimize PLP treatment.
Though initially proposed as a diagnostic tool in PNPO deficiency, B6 vitamer measurement in plasma may possibly offer the potential for more detailed treatment monitoring [54,55].
However, its clinical implementation requires the development of validated reference ranges.
In the meantime, the management of PNPO deficiency patients on PLP therapy should incorporate systematic screening for the development of liver disease.
