Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has transformed the treatment of locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer.
However, identifying reliable predictive markers for treatment efficacy remains challenging.
We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of peripheral blood regulatory T (Treg) cells in patients with G/GEJ cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy followed by curative resection.
From July 2020 to May 2023, 79 patients met the inclusion criteria.
All patients achieved R0 resection following D2 radical surgery, with 26.6% exhibiting a pathological complete response (pCR).
Significant differences in Treg cells, T/Treg ratios, and CD4+/Treg ratios were observed between patients with pCR and those without after one treatment cycle (P= 0.0054, 0.0489, and 0.0434, respectively).
Patients were categorized based on changes in Treg cell counts post-treatment, revealing a higher pCR rate in those with reduced Treg cells (P= 0.014).
Changes in Treg cell counts after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy serve as a promising predictive marker for pCR in locally advanced G/GEJ cancer patients.
This finding supports the development of personalized treatment strategies, enhancing outcomes in this challenging clinical landscape.

In the realm of oncology, the introduction of immunotherapy has markedly transformed the treatment landscape for various cancers, including gastric and gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancers.
These malignancies represent a significant global health challenge, contributing extensively to cancer-related morbidity and mortality1,2.
Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the prognosis for patients with locally advanced G/GEJ cancers remains poor, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become fundamental in managing these cancers, aiming at tumor reduction and the elimination of micrometastases prior to surgical intervention3,4.
This strategy lays the groundwork for more successful surgical outcomes, increasing the likelihood of complete tumor resection.
The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway, have been effectively incorporated into neoadjuvant protocols, offering new hope for enhancing patient survival5.
The incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those targeting the PD-1 pathway, into neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy leverages the synergistic effects of these modalities to enhance tumor reduction and potentially improve survival rates.
This strategy marks a paradigm shift in the management of G/GEJ cancers, aiming to recalibrate the body’s immune response against cancer cells6.
However, the therapeutic landscape of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy is complex, characterized by significant variability in patient responses.
This variability highlights the intricate interactions between cancer and the immune system.
Some patients may achieve a pathological complete response (pCR), indicating no detectable cancer cells post-treatment, which is associated with favorable long-term outcomes7–9.
The occurrence of pCR underscores the potential efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy but also emphasizes the urgent need for reliable biomarkers to predict treatment success.
A key area of research is the immunological milieu within the tumor microenvironment, particularly the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in influencing the effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapies.
This introduction explores the dynamics of Tregs in the context of neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody treatment in patients with locally advanced G/GEJ cancers, focusing on their impact on pCR rates post-surgery.
In the pursuit of personalized medicine, identifying predictive markers is essential.
These markers are crucial for tailoring treatment plans that optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects for patients unlikely to benefit.
Within the immune landscape, Tregs, a specialized subset of CD4 + T cells, play a central role10,11.
Tregs, through their immunosuppressive capabilities, maintain immune homeostasis by orchestrating the body’s response to both internal and external threats, including cancer12.
The interplay between effector immune cells and Tregs within the tumor microenvironment critically influences cancer progression and responses to immunotherapy13,14.
This balance may either promote tumor progression by enabling immune evasion or enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy by modifying the immune milieu15.
Consequently, modulating Treg activity has become a promising target in cancer immunotherapy.
Elucidating the role of Tregs in neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for G/GEJ cancer offers the potential to uncover new insights into the mechanisms driving treatment response and resistance.
This study investigates the dynamics of peripheral blood Tregs as a prognostic tool for assessing the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in patients with locally advanced G/GEJ cancer.
By examining lymphocyte subpopulations before and after one therapy cycle, our research aims to elucidate the relationship between Tregs and clinical outcomes, particularly in achieving pCR.
Given the complex interplay between the immune system and cancer progression, our study contributes to refining cancer treatment precision by tailoring strategies to the unique immunological profiles of individual patients.
Additionally, this research sheds light on the immunological underpinnings of treatment responses, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic innovation.
By delineating the intricate interactions between immune cells and cancer cells, we aim to develop novel strategies to combat G/GEJ malignancies, thereby enriching the therapeutic arsenal against this challenging disease.
Through these efforts, we seek to advance the scientific understanding of cancer immunotherapy and foster the development of more effective, personalized treatment modalities, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in G/GEJ cancers.
Between July 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023, a total of 79 patients with locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy were enrolled in this study.
The inclusion criteria for patient selection are comprehensively detailed in the “Materials and methods” Section.
Patients were stratified into two groups based on their pathological response post-surgery: the pCR group and the non-pCR group.
The pCR group consisted of 21 patients, while the non-pCR group comprised 58 patients.
The baseline characteristics of both groups are summarized in Table1.
As illustrated in Table1, aside from differences in the interval between the final cycle of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery and PD-L1 CPS expression, no other characteristics exhibited statistically significant differences between the two groups.
§The Her2 status was unavailable in one patients with non-pCR.
#The status of PD-L1 CPS was unavailable in three patients with pCR and nine patients with non-pCR.
We measured the counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, T cells, B cells, CD3 + CD4 + cells, CD3 + CD8 + cells, and Tregs in the peripheral blood of patients prior to treatment.
Using the independent samples t-test, we found no statistically significant differences in Treg counts between the pCR group and the non-pCR group (Table2; Fig.1A).
Further comparative analysis of T/Treg ratios, CD4 + T/Treg, and CD8 + T/Treg ratios also showed no statistically significant differences between the two patient groups (Table2, Fig. S1A, D, G).
Comparison of lymphocyte subgroup at baseline (/dL).
Dynamics of Treg Cells During Treatment.
(A) Treg cell counts at baseline between the two groups, demonstrating no significant statistical difference.
(B) Treg cell counts before the second cycle of therapy, illustrating a statistically significant disparity in Treg cell counts between patients achieving pathological complete response (pCR) and those not achieving pCR.
(C) Changes in Treg cell counts after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, revealing a decrease in Treg cell counts in patients who achieved pCR.
Following one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, we conducted a statistical analysis of the counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, CD3 + CD4 + cells, CD3 + CD8 + cells, and Tregs in the patients’ peripheral blood.
The independent samples t-test revealed statistically significant differences in Tregs between the pCR and non-pCR groups, specifically in the levels of T lymphocytes and Tregs (Table3; Fig.1B).
Further comparative analyses of the T/Treg, CD4 + T/Treg, and CD8 + T/Treg ratios indicated that the differences in ratios between the groups were also statistically significant (Table3, Fig. S1B, E, H), highlighting the potential immunological markers of response to therapy.
Comparison of lymphocyte subgroup before the second cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (/dL).
After a single cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, we calculated and compared the changes in lymphocyte subpopulations (by subtracting the counts of lymphocyte subpopulations before the second cycle from those before the first cycle of treatment).
The results demonstrated statistically significant differences in the changes in Tregs between the pCR group and the non-pCR group (Table4; Fig.1C).
In the pCR group, Tregs levels decreased after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, whereas in the non-pCR group, Tregs levels increased following the initial cycle of treatment.
Comparison the changes of lymphocyte subgroup from the second cycle of neoadjuvant therapy to baseline (/dL).
In our study, we conducted a detailed comparison of the changes in T/Treg ratios, CD4 + T/Treg ratios, and CD8 + T/Treg ratios after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.
We found that, following one treatment cycle, the differences in T/Treg ratios and CD8 + T/Treg ratios between the pCR group and the non-pCR group were statistically significant (Table4, Fig. S1C, F, I).
After one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, an increase in Treg cells was observed in 37 patients, of whom 5 achieved a pCR, resulting in a pCR rate of 13.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.0-25.1%).
Conversely, among the 42 patients who experienced a decrease in Treg cells, 16 achieved a pCR, marking a pCR rate of 38.1% (95% CI: 22.8–53.4%).
Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in pCR rates between the groups with increased and decreased Tregs (P= 0.014).
As of the last follow-up date on December 31, 2023, the average follow-up period was 20.9 months (95% confidence interval: 19.2–22.7 months).
The median DFS and OS have not yet been reached for the patients.
The DFS and OS curves for all patients are displayed in Fig.2A.
Within the group achieving pCR, there was one case of recurrence, with the affected patient still alive at the last follow-up.
In the non-pCR group, there were 16 recurrences and 10 deaths.
Although the median DFS for both the pCR and non-pCR groups has not been reached, survival analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in DFS between the two groups (P= 0.0245) (Fig.2B).
Survival Analysis.
(A) Kaplan-Meier curves illustrating Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) for all patients enrolled in this study.
(B) DFS stratified by tumor regression.
Patients achieving pathological complete response (pCR) demonstrated significantly prolonged median DFS compared to non-pCR counterparts.
(C) DFS stratified by changes in Treg cell counts following one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.
Patients experiencing decreased Treg cell counts exhibited extended DFS compared to those with elevated Treg cell counts.
Patients were also categorized into groups with increased or decreased Tregs following one cycle of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.
There were 12 recurrences in the increased Treg group compared to 5 in the decreased Treg group, showing a statistically significant difference in DFS between these groups (P= 0.0067) (Fig.2C).
We conducted a subgroup analysis of DFS based on the expression of PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) and Her2 expression in pre-operative biopsy specimens, as well as post-operative lymph node involvement.
Our findings revealed that the differences in DFS between subgroups with PD-L1 CPS < 1 and ≥ 1, as well as those with Her2 overexpression or not, did not reach statistical significance (for specific P values, refer to Figs.
S2A and B).
However, when patients were categorized into pN positive (with residual tumor) and pN negative (without residual tumor) groups based on post-operative lymph node status, a statistically significant difference in DFS was observed between these two groups (P= 0.0011) (Fig. S2C).
Our study reveals significant insights into the dynamics of Treg cells during neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in G/GEJ cancer, highlighting their correlation with post-surgical pCR rates.
We observed that an increase in Treg cells after one cycle of treatment correlates with a lower pCR rate, while a decrease suggests better outcomes.
This underscores the dual role of Tregs; although essential for immune balance and preventing autoimmunity, their immunosuppressive functions can impede effective antitumor responses, thereby influencing the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatments in G/GEJ cancers.
These findings align with previous research indicating that Tregs can promote tumor growth by suppressing antitumor immunity, corroborating our observations of improved treatment outcomes following Treg reduction13,14.
As shown in Table1, apart from the differences in baseline PD-L1 expression and the interval between the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, other baseline characteristics between the pCR and non-pCR groups are comparable.
CM649 and Orient16 have confirmed that PD-L1 CPS expression is an indicator of whether patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer benefit from first-line chemotherapy and immunotherapy combination6,16.
Similar results have been found in clinical studies on neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy for gastric cancer5.
The results of this study are consistent with these published findings, as patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 are more likely to achieve pCR when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
A longer interval between the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery may provide activated lymphocytes with sufficient time to clear residual tumor cells, thereby improving the pathological response.
This may explain why the interval between the last surgery in the pCR group was longer than in the non-pCR group in this study.
This result is consistent with the NADIM study, where surgery performed 6–7 weeks after the last neoadjuvant therapy significantly improved the pCR rate17,18.
Differences in Treg cell dynamics between pCR and non-pCR groups, particularly in the T/Treg ratio post-treatment, highlight a valuable indicator of treatment efficacy.
These results underscore the importance of a balanced immune environment with regulated Treg activity for achieving pCR.
Extensive research has shown that high Treg levels correlate with poorer outcomes in various cancers10,14.
Furthermore, a decrease in Treg levels correlates with improved DFS, emphasizing Treg monitoring as a promising biomarker for predicting treatment success and survival in G/GEJ cancer.
Modulating Tregs, in conjunction with traditional therapies, may significantly enhance patient survival by boosting antitumor immunity19,20.
The complex interplay between Treg cells and cancer treatment efficacy, especially during neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for G/GEJ cancer, situates our research within a critical area of oncological investigation.
Our study highlights how Treg dynamics correlate with pCR rates and DFS, offering insights that both align with and expand upon existing literature on the dual role of Treg cells in cancer.
These cells are pivotal for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity but can also impair antitumor immune responses.
For example, Facciabene et al. emphasized the negative prognostic impact of high Treg infiltration in ovarian cancer, pointing to a need for strategies that modulate Treg levels to improve patient outcomes21.
Similarly, foundational work by Sakaguchi et al. on Treg mechanisms supports their role in promoting tumor growth10, and Mao et al. suggested that immune environment manipulation could enhance response to breast cancer therapy22.
Our findings underscore the potential of targeting Tregs to enhance neoadjuvant treatment efficacy in G/GEJ cancers, dovetailing with broader oncological research that seeks to refine immunomodulatory approaches.
Comparatively, studies focusing on neoadjuvant immunotherapy in cancers such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer have also reported on the predictive value of Treg alterations.
A study by van Pul et al. on melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor, observed that reductions in peripheral blood Tregs correlated with improved patient outcomes23.
This finding parallels our observations in G/GEJ cancer, suggesting a potential universal biomarker across different cancers for predicting response to therapy.
Moreover, the work of Pardoll on PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors in treating various cancers emphasizes the intricate balance between activating effective antitumor immunity and regulating immune tolerance24.
Our study aligns with this perspective, showing that Treg cell dynamics can serve as an essential indicator of this balance and thus the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.
Recent studies in gastric cancer specifically, such as the one by Li et al., have begun to explore the predictive role of Tregs in response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, affirming the relevance of our findings to current research trends25.
These studies, however, often focus on the static presence of Tregs pre- and post-treatment, whereas our research contributes a novel angle by examining the dynamic changes in Tregs and their relation to treatment outcomes.
Furthermore, the prognostic value of Tregs modulation in enhancing therapy effectiveness is highlighted in the comprehensive review by Tanaka and Sakaguchi, which meticulously outlines the potential therapeutic strategies targeting Treg cells14.
Our research supports this proposed strategy, suggesting that monitoring and potentially modulating Tregs levels could be a viable approach to improving neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy outcomes in G/GEJ cancer.
By demonstrating the significance of Tregs alterations in the context of chemoimmunotherapy for G/GEJ cancer, our study not only corroborates the critical role of Tregs in cancer progression but also suggests a targeted approach for enhancing treatment responses.
Our study contributes to the growing body of literature that explores the complex role of Treg cells in cancer, emphasizing their impact on treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.
By detailing the dynamics of Tregs changes in response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in G/GEJ cancer and establishing a link to pCR rates and DFS, we offer new insights into the potential of immunomodulatory strategies in oncology.
This research not only enriches our understanding of Tregs’ role in cancer therapy but also paves the way for future investigations aimed at harnessing the immune system to combat cancer more effectively.
Our study offers important insights into the role of Treg dynamics in the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for G/GEJ.
However, the retrospective design presents limitations that may affect the interpretability and generalizability of our findings.
This design restricts our ability to control for confounding variables such as treatment protocol variations and patient comorbidities, potentially introducing bias and impacting the reliability of our conclusions.
Additionally, the single-center nature of our study limits the diversity of patient populations and treatment responses, which may not reflect broader healthcare settings.
Consequently, our findings may not be universally applicable to all gastric cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.
Thirdly, the relatively small sample size further limits our study.
A larger cohort is needed to capture the diversity and complexity of gastric cancer and to confirm the robustness of our results.
While we observed correlations between Treg dynamics and treatment outcomes, our study does not explore the underlying mechanisms.
Understanding the biological pathways through which Tregs affect treatment efficacy is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies.
Future research should aim to validate these findings in larger, multicentric studies and conduct mechanistic studies to understand Treg influence on antitumor immunity.
Exploring combinatory therapies that target Tregs and enhance effector T cell functions could improve outcomes.
The potential of Treg levels as a dynamic biomarker warrants further investigation to refine patient selection and tailor neoadjuvant therapy strategies more effectively.
In conclusion, this study sheds light on the dynamic interplay between Tregs and the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in G/GEJ cancer, offering new avenues for research and potential therapeutic interventions.
The intricate balance between immune suppression and activation emerges as a critical factor in achieving optimal treatment outcomes, highlighting the importance of immune monitoring and modulation in cancer therapy.
