Dementia is a growing public health concern in South and Southeast Asia, yet the region's dementia literacy remains poorly understood.
This review aimed to synthesise existing research on dementia literacy among South and Southeast Asian populations and diasporas, identifying barriers to literacy and risk reduction.
Six databases (MEDLINE, PubMED, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, ProQuest and Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 2024, with 73 articles from 11 countries identified for inclusion, data extraction and quality appraisal using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
Most studies demonstrated low levels of general dementia literacy (78%) and awareness of dementia risk factors (32%).
There was a prevalent belief that dementia is a normal process of ageing.
Lower dementia literacy was reported for individuals from Vietnam compared to individuals from India and Pakistan.
Stigma, language barriers, lack of culturally appropriate resources and religious beliefs were common factors hindering dementia awareness and risk reduction.
Targeted interventions are necessary to increase dementia literacy in South and Southeast Asian populations, where awareness is poor and misconceptions continue.
Our review urges policymakers to implement culturally sensitive education programs, reduce stigma, raise awareness of dementia risk factors, develop and validate appropriate screening tools, and strengthen health‐care responses to achieve immediate improvements and reduce the long‐term burden of dementia‐related health issues in South and Southeast Asia.
Thus, this systematic review aimed to (i) synthesise current knowledge of dementia literacy, including understanding of risk factors and strategies for reduction in South and Southeast Asia; (ii) determine how population type (e.g. student, health‐care worker, older person, family caregiver) differs in their knowledge and attitudes towards dementia and risk management; and (iii) explore attitudes towards dementia risk reduction, including perceived barriers and facilitators.
Findings of this review will inform future interventions and policies, contributing to improved dementia literacy and more effective public health strategies in these high‐burden regions.
The protocol for this systematic review was preregistered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022369886).22Reporting adhered to the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) statement.23For the purpose of this review, dementia literacy refers to specific knowledge in relation to dementia.
‘Literacy’ is used interchangeably with ‘knowledge’ and ‘awareness’ in this review.
Attitude towards dementia refers to either negative or positive perceptions of the disease, its manifestations, causes and symptoms.
Studies were identified through Medline via Ovid, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane (from inception‐2024) and Google Scholar using specific search terms (see AppendixS1).
Search terms consisted of three categories (types of dementia, knowledge/awareness and country/region), which were combined using the Boolean operator ‘AND’.
The initial search was conducted in November 2022 and re‐run in February 2024 to ensure recency.
Study populations with average age over 18 years from South Asian nations (India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and the Maldives) and Southeast Asian nations (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam).
Studies of communities from the above‐named nations, including immigrant diasporas defined as people who were born and raised in one of the countries of interest and lived in a different country at the time of the study.
Qualitative (e.g. interviews and focus groups) and quantitative assessment (e.g. responses to standardised surveys or tools) of dementia knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and misconceptions towards dementia and/or barriers and facilitators to dementia literacy.
Studies failing to report age data were included if the population type and context of participant recruitment justified the assumption that the average age of the sample is over 18 years.
For example, caregivers and undergraduate students are unlikely to include participants under 18 years.
Non‐peer‐reviewed and non‐English language studies were excluded.
A reference snowballing process was conducted on previous review papers to identify any missed and relevant studies.
Study characteristics were extracted into a tabulated form, including study type, measures used and characteristics of study samples (e.g. country, sample size and mean age).
Both quantitative and qualitative findings were synthesised to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
For the quantitative data, we reported the proportion of studies that discussed specific outcome measures to compare results between nations, populations (immigrants vs. non‐immigrants) and demographic groups.
Scores from dementia literacy and awareness surveys were categorised into general awareness and symptoms, causes and risk factors.
Study sample responses to standardised quantitative tools were categorised into low, medium and high literacy to support understanding, and were based on evidence‐based metrics for the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (AKDS).26This was applied to all other scales and used to determine the sample's literacy level across dementia literacy domains of overall knowledge, general awareness and symptoms, causes and risk factors.
The study evaluating the psychometric properties of the ADKS, by Carpenter et al., stated that low scorers answered between 17 and 35 items out of 49 correctly, which is between 35% and 71%.26High scorers answered between 40 and 48 items out of 49 correctly, which is between 82% and 98%.
Therefore, we assumed that medium scorers scored between 71% and 82%.
When applied to the modified 30‐item ADKS using these percentages, a score below 21 represents low knowledge, 21–23 represents medium knowledge, and a score of 24 and higher represents high knowledge.
These same percentages were applied to all the other scales, including subscales, in order to standardise results.
The same percentages were also used to classify literacy levels where the studies have reported results in percentage scores.
AppendixS2shows the range of scores indicating low, medium and high literacy in each domain, for each standardised scale.
Quantitative measures of attitudes towards dementia were recorded in a separate category and were standardised such that a score above 50% would be classified as a positive attitude and less than 50% would be classified as a negative attitude (AppendixS3).
Qualitative findings were extracted into a standardised form, focusing on key themes, such as symptoms, causes, risk factors and barriers/enablers to literacy.
These themes were synthesised across studies to capture commonalities and differences.
The quantitative and qualitative data were narratively compared and reported using narrative synthesis.
The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to critically appraise studies and was conducted independently by two reviewers, with a third reviewer randomly cross‐checking data extraction in 10% of studies.27The MMAT provides a comprehensive assessment of qualitative, quantitative and mixed‐methods studies by employing specific screening criteria tailored to each study type.
For qualitative studies, the tool evaluates the appropriateness of the qualitative approach in addressing research questions, the adequacy of data collection methods and the derivation of findings from the data.
In contrast, quantitative studies undergo scrutiny regarding the relevance of the sampling strategy, the representativeness of the sample vis‐à‐vis the target population, and the potential for non‐response bias.
Mixed‐methods studies are assessed for the rationale behind employing a mixed‐methods design, the effective integration of study components to address research questions, and the handling of divergences or inconsistencies between quantitative and qualitative findings.
An overall score was given to each study out of seven (one point for every ‘yes’ response), with zero indicating lowest quality and seven indicating highest quality.

Note: NR indicates that the data have not been reported.
Over a third of the quantitative and mixed‐methods studies (n= 14/37; 38%) used either self‐developed or adapted tools from previous research to assess dementia literacy.
Of the standardised tools employed, the most common was the ADKS26(n= 9/37; 24%), followed by the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS),101(n= 7/37; 19%) and Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS) (n= 6/37; 16%).102Other less commonly used tools included the Dementia Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ)50and Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ)103(bothn= 2/37; 5%).
The remaining studies employed scales, such as the Barts Explanatory Model Inventory for Dementia (BEMI‐D)104and scales designed specifically for general practititioners.105,106Tools used exclusively to measure attitudes towards dementia included the Adolescent Attitudes towards Dementia Scale (AADS)107and Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Test (ADAT)108(bothn= 2/37; 5%) (AppendixS4).
Quantitative findings indicated that most studies (29/37; 78%) reported low levels of overall dementia literacy, with only a fifth (8/37; 22%) indicating medium literacy (Table3).
Specifically, most studies (30/37; 81%) reported low literacy levels in the ‘general awareness and symptoms’ domain, with a smaller proportion indicating average literacy (7/37; 19%).
The ‘causes’ domain also showed low literacy (12/37; 32%), while the ‘risk factors’ domain reported similarly low literature in almost a third of the studies (12/37; 32%).
Note: L indicates low literacy in the domain mentioned in the column, M indicates medium literacy and NR indicates that domain was not reported on.
Significance of colour shades are visually identifiy the literacy levels (ie Low, Medium, Not Reported).
General population had a negative attitude while health‐care workers had a positive attitude.
Results were inconsistent between different scales, with DKAS results demonstrating low literacy and DAS demonstrating medium literacy.
Qualitative data identified common misconceptions (Table4), with over half of the studies (24/41; 59%) indicating the belief that dementia is a normal part of ageing.
Misconceptions about the causes of dementia were widespread, with only 15% (6/41) of studies showing accurate knowledge about symptoms and 24% (10/41) showing accurate knowledge about causes.
The inherent belief in supernatural causes of dementia was found in a third (15/41; 37%) of studies which described demonic possession, karma, destiny, black magic and God's will as part of the causes.
While more than half of the studies (22/41; 54%) correctly identified life stressors and social isolation as contributing factors, these were often misinterpreted as causes rather than risk factors.
Note: + indicates the presence of the element mentioned in the column, − indicates the absence of it, and NR indicates that it was not reported on.
Significance of colour shades is visually identifiy the literacy levels (ie Low, Medium, Not Reported).
Studies were coded positive for stigma if there was specific mention of stigma or stigmatising language such as ‘crazy’ or ‘mad’ were used.
Studies were coded positive for shame if there was specific mention of shame towards dementia patients (e.g. being ashamed of having a relative with dementia).
A theme of stigma was evident in more than half (24/41; 59%) of the qualitative studies, with participants using stigmatising language, such as ‘crazy’, ‘dirty’ and ‘mad’ to consistently describe individuals with dementia.29,48,67,69,70,81,97,98Many studies highlighted the blame placed on patients for their condition,69,99along with a belief that their symptoms are contagious.76A small number (7/41; 17%) of studies discussed familial shame leading to secrecy about the diagnosis and social isolation of the patient.
Some studies of both immigrant and non‐immigrant samples (5/41; 12%) further noted the absence of culturally and linguistically appropriate awareness programs in their community, acting as barriers to dementia literacy and risk reduction.54,67,79,97,99Approximately half (22/41; 54%) of studies identified various other obstacles, including misdiagnosis, inadequate education by health‐care providers, perception of dementia symptoms as non‐pathological, social exclusion of patients and lack of awareness programs.
One study conducted on a sample of Indian people living in the UK further highlighted beliefs in a ‘possessed person’ (dementia patient) spreading symptoms through a ‘curse’ (dementia) within the family, impacting future generations and marriage prospects.85These beliefs further contributed to heightened misconceptions, hindering educational efforts and, consequently, impeding risk reduction strategies.
Despite these challenges, most (15/19; 79%) quantitative studies indicated overall positive attitudes towards people with dementia, particularly among non‐immigrant populations.
Among Indian, Pakistani and Vietnamese participants, the belief that dementia is a normal part of ageing was highest among Vietnamese (6/9; 67%), followed by Indian (10/18; 56%) and Pakistani (7/13; 54%) participants.
There were a few that disagreed with this notion (e.g. two Pakistani studies74,96and one Indian study74).
Supernatural explanations for dementia were more common in Pakistan (6/13; 46%) and India (7/18; 39%) than in Vietnam (2/9; 22%).
Similarly, the presence of stigma towards individuals with dementia was highest in the Pakistani population (9/13; 69%) compared to Vietnamese (5/9; 56%) and Indian (10/18; 56%) communities.
All three countries cited language barriers and a lack of educational programs as hindrances to dementia education.
Immigrants and non‐immigrant populations agreed with the statement ‘dementia is a normal part of ageing’ to a similar extent (15/26; 58%, 8/14; 57%, respectively).
Both population types had similar reports for low knowledge of dementia symptoms (13/26; 50% in immigrant, 7/14; 50% in non‐immigrant).
Supernatural causes of dementia were reported more frequently in studies with immigrant populations (10/26; 39%) than non‐immigrant populations (4/14; 29%).
However, stigma was more prevalent in non‐immigrant populations (13/26; 50% in immigrant, 11/14; 79% in non‐immigrant).
A slightly higher proportion of non‐immigrant studies compared to immigrant studies reported shame (4/26; 1% in immigrant, 3/14; 21% in non‐immigrant).
The general population, health‐care workers and students showed similarly low levels of dementia literacy, with 81% (13/16) of the general population, 71% (5/7) of health‐care workers and 70% (7/10) of students demonstrating low knowledge.
Qualitative data indicated that informal/family caregivers and the general population agreed with the statement ‘dementia is a normal part of ageing’ to a similar extent (15/25; 60% in family caregivers, 7/11; 64% in general population), whereas older persons and people with dementia appeared to agree with it to a lesser extent (5/9; 56%).
Family carers reported higher stigma rates compared to the general population (15/25; 60% in family caregivers, 6/11; 55% in general population).
Similarly, shame was identified in 20% (5/25) studies of family caregivers and was not reported in any studies which included the general population.
This review is the first to consolidate existing qualitative and quantitative knowledge on dementia literacy and attitudes in South and Southeast Asia, and investigate factors hindering and supporting dementia literacy and risk reduction.
Our results identified widespread misconceptions about dementia across multiple domains, including symptoms, causes and risk factors.
Barriers to improving dementia literacy included the lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate resources, inadequate education from health‐care providers and pervasive stigma.
These findings have important implications for shaping targeted interventions and policy strategies to improve dementia literacy and reduce associated risks.
Cultural norms, including religious philosophies, family responsibilities and language, appear to shape how dementia is understood at a community level in the region.13These factors contribute to the widespread belief that dementia is an inevitable part of ageing, particularly in contexts where dementia‐specific terminology is lacking.13,57,59Such cultural influences suggest that targeted interventions that engage communities on their own terms are required to acknowledge these specific knowledge gaps.
Our review highlighted low dementia literacy among employee and student cohorts within the health‐care sector.
This poses a challenge to the workforces' readiness to care and support people with dementia.
Lee et al.9suggest that diagnostic uncertainty and the nihilistic attitude of general practitioners in Asia are major contributors to dementia diagnostic delays.
Thus, specific dementia education for health‐care workers should be implemented to reduce future dementia prevalence.
Despite low knowledge of causes and risk factors, life stressors (more commonly referred to as ‘tension’) were readily identified as a cause rather than a risk factor by participants in the included studies.67,70,72,75,92,93,99Belief in supernatural causes of dementia was found to be prevalent particularly in Pakistan and among immigrant populations.
Demonic possession, being under a spell, being cursed and karma were some of the spiritual causes identified, and these concepts overlapped with stigmatising language and beliefs towards dementia.73,77,80,98In some cases, religion was found to be the root of false belief about the causes of dementia52,66,76,86,93,96,98This religious dimension has been similarly noted in a previous systematic review12and is indicative of the deep‐rooted value that people place on religion and its influence on understanding of cognitive illness.
The prevalence of stigma and misconceptions evident in this review may act as a barrier for education about dementia.
Many studies reported family members and informal caregivers hiding their loved one's dementia diagnosis and socially isolating them due to shame.69,91Despite these challenges, the review identified generally positive attitudes towards individuals with dementia, suggesting an opportunity to leverage these attitudes in future interventions.
The lack of linguistically and culturally appropriate resources and education programs about dementia was clearly articulated in the studies.
Unsurprisingly, this barrier was more frequently reported in immigrant populations.54,90This observation is consistent with a recent systematic review stating that the lack of resources for immigrants.111Similarly, immigrant participants were more likely to report poor education from health‐care professionals regarding a loved one's dementia diagnosis.80,97A study conducted by Sagbakken et al.112discusses the challenge of educating migrant families about dementia due to the reliance on an interpreter during discussion.
While overall dementia literacy was similar between immigrants and non‐immigrants in our study, the factors above may have contributed to our finding of a higher prevalence of misconceptions in the immigrant population.
Furthermore, immigrants face unique challenges, such as poor assimilation to the new country, and are more likely to face financial constraints and social isolation, which further contribute to suboptimal dementia education.113Immigrants may also lack local knowledge of medical systems and referral options for dementia screening.
The most notable merit of the current review is the extensive and systematic nature of the database search.
The inclusion of qualitative studies allowed for a contextual understanding and synthesis of the current knowledge of dementia, which was lacking in previous reviews.15Additionally, we used the MMAT for quality appraisal,27which is a validated, evidence‐based tool that allowed accurate assessment of included articles and awareness of any biases.
While the majority of studies received the maximum score on the MMAT, which was the case for most qualitative studies, several quantitative studies received lower scores due to gender bias, small sample sizes, bias due to opportunistic sampling, and, in some cases, unreported response rates to surveys.
These weaknesses identified via the MMAT risk the validity of several studies, thus negatively impacting our results.
Our synthesis of data from 11 nationalities ensured that most of the geographical locations of interest were represented, although we acknowledge the lack of studies from certain countries, such as Bhutan, Afghanistan and Thailand.
The heterogeneous nature of studies and volume of studies made comparison of results challenging, and the heterogeneity of data collection tools in quantitative studies made standardisation complex.
Our scale standardisation method is arbitrary despite the assistance of evidence‐based statistics (based on the ADKS)26and may not have been suitable for the diverse nature of the scales involved as they are potentially not comparable.
The attempt to standardise these scales may have resulted in an oversimplification of the results, and this may have contributed to the discrepancy in results of the DKAS and DAS after standardisation explained previously.
However, the systematic approach undertaken ensured that the results were robust.
Secondly, we excluded non‐English studies, potentially leading to the omission of insights from non‐English‐speaking populations, although several studies consisted of non‐English‐speaking participants with the assistance of an interpreter or translation of verbatim transcripts and the use of translated standardised scales.31,33,41,42,43,44,46,47,48,49,50,56,58,61,64Thirdly, the absence of grey literature may have resulted in overlooking national data and statistics related to dementia knowledge and attitudes.
Fourthly, our analysis did not include several countries (Bhutan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand) due to the lack of studies meeting eligibility criteria, thereby introducing a potential bias towards the nationalities we included, thereby limiting the generalisability of results to South and Southeast Asia.
Finally, the predominance of female participants in several studies raises concerns about gender bias, although it was noted that carers are typically female and this predominance is expected given the large volume of carer‐based studies included.
Given our findings of misconceptions rooted in religion, it is important to consider that religion may pose an additional challenge to future educational interventions aiming to enhance dementia literacy.14,122Much of these beliefs exist at a family level; thus, family‐based training sessions focused on addressing misconceptions may be effective in improving literacy.
Furthermore, the involvement of religious bodies and leaders in these sessions may be better received and more effective.
With regard to immigrant populations, faith‐based and immigrant community‐based interventions conducted in their first language will allow families to be educated in a culturally sensitive manner.
Host countries have an increasingly important role in facilitating dementia awareness within their immigrant communities.123Training and employing more professional foreign language interpreters and assigning cultural liaison officers for individuals living with dementia will allow for enhanced dementia education for patients and their families.
Furthermore, health‐care facilities should liaise and collaborate with cultural associations to provide linguistically and culturally appropriate education and resources.
Future research should aim to expand the geographical scope of current evidence by including studies from underrepresented countries in South and Southeast Asia, such as Bhutan, Afghanistan and Thailand.
Such inclusion would provide a more comprehensive understanding of regional variations in dementia literacy.
There is also a clear need for longitudinal studies to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of dementia literacy interventions, particularly those identified as promising in this review.
To strengthen the methodological rigour of future reviews, studies employing consistent sampling strategies and achieving high response rates should be prioritised.
Additionally, the current review identified a paucity of high‐quality mixed‐methods studies.
Given the capacity of mixed‐methods research to integrate quantitative measures with qualitative insights, future work should more fully embrace this approach to capture both the extent and the underlying drivers of dementia literacy across diverse populations.
We also acknowledge the absence of statistical analyses comparing regional differences or demographic subgroups.
This was primarily due to the heterogeneity in study design, outcome measures and reporting practices, which limited the feasibility of such analyses.
Nonetheless, these limitations reflect the importance of future research adopting standardised methodologies and reporting frameworks that facilitate comparative analysis, including subgroup analyses by age, gender, occupation and health‐care access.
Finally, existing dementia literacy assessment tools are largely developed in Western contexts and may lack cultural and contextual relevance for South and Southeast Asian populations.
Future efforts should focus on the development and validation of culturally adapted instruments to ensure more accurate and meaningful assessment in these settings.
This review provides the first comprehensive synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data regarding dementia literacy levels in South Asia and Southeast Asia and highlights significant gaps in knowledge, barriers to education and prevalent misconceptions.
These findings offer a foundation for the development of targeted interventions and policy frameworks to enhance dementia literacy, reduce stigma and improve dementia care.
The challenges identified in this review, particularly those related to cultural and linguistic factors, must be carefully considered in the design of future education and awareness campaigns.
