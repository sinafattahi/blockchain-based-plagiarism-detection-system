This study employs Mie’s scattering theory and van de Hulst’s mixing model to predict the refractive indices (n,k) of silver nanowire (AgNW) networks in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, allowing the comparison to the experimentally determinedkspectra.
Transmittance spectra calculated via the numerical resolution of Fresnel’s equations are compared to experimental data, showing excellent agreement, particularly for nanowires with larger diameters and at shorter wavelengths.
These findings, both theoretical and empirical, pave the way for accurate optical simulations of metallic nanowire networks, supporting their integration into complex multilayer systems and devices such as displays or smart windows.
Notably, our work proposes the first demonstration of the dominance of the metallic character of AgNW networks over their dielectric behavior in terms of optical response.
Transparent Conducting Materials (TCMs) constitute an essential class of materials that combine high optical transparency with excellent electrical conductivity, making them key building blocks of most modern electronic devices such as photovoltaic cells, OLEDs, transparent heaters, sensors or smart windows [1,2].
Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) remains the most widely used TCM due to its excellent optoelectronic properties [3], but extensive research for alternatives has been carried out over the past decade, motivated by the limited supply of ITO, its known brittleness and stringent deposition temperatures [4].
Amongst these alternatives, AgNW networks stand out as one of the most promising candidates thanks to their optical transparency and sheet resistance comparable to those of ITO (sheet resistance of a few.associated with an optical transmittance of 80% at the wavelengthnm), with the added benefits of high mechanical flexibility, as well as low-cost and scalable deposition methods [5,6].
While the use of AgNW networks does present challenges, such as surface roughness and susceptibility to environmental degradation, these can be effectively mitigated through protective coatings based on semiconducting oxides such as ZnO or[7–10].
The electrical conductivity of silver nanowire networks originates from a percolation mechanism, through which current can flow via the intersections between nanowires [11–15].
The optical transparency is made possible by the remaining gaps in between the nanowires, allowing light to go through.
Both properties are connected to one another, as adding more nanowires tends to increase the conductance while decreasing the transmittance, and inversely [16].
This trade-off is well-known and when designing networks for applications, its optimum, typically quantified via Haacke’s figure of merit [17], is application-dependent [18].
In that context, being able to predict the optical properties of the AgNW network holds much importance.
When studying a material’s optical properties, determining its refractive indices (RIs) is often insightful.
The knowledge - and physical understanding - of the RIs of a material serves as a physical probe into its fundamental optical properties.
Additionally, it enables the material’s integration into multilayer stack simulations, commonly performed with the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) [19–21].
This method allows for the calculation of the optical transmittance, reflectance, and absorbance of a stack, provided the RIs of all constituent materials are known across relevant wavelengths, thus facilitating the design of complex devices that combine multiple materials such as those typically used in smart windows [22] or solar cell designs [23].
In this work, we argue that Eq.
(2) yields only theeffectiverefractive indices of the (AgNW network/glass) hybrid, rather than those of the AgNW network alone.
This argument stems from the observation that Eq.
(2) is traditionally applied to isotropic, homogeneous dielectric materials with smooth boundaries [28–30], conditions which do not describe the heterogeneous, metallic-dielectric nature of AgNW networks.
The latter indeed exhibit characteristics of both metals and dielectrics - electrical conductivity and optical transparency -, such that assuming that they follow a purely dielectric optical behavior would require a solid theoretical or experimental validation.
Furthermore, the structure of Eq.
(2) inherently constrains the value ofnto be equal to or greater than 1, which is incompatible with metallic materials deposited on dielectrics, as these typically exhibitnvalues below 1 in the visible range due to surface plasmon resonance effects arising from free electron oscillations [31].
In light of the aforementioned observations and as illustrated in Fig.1, we propose an original approach to investigate the RIs of AgNW networks.
We do however note that the determination of theeffectiverefractive index remains useful, as it can allow for the prediction of the optical behavior of the combined (AgNW network/glass) hybrid material, making it valuable for applications in which that specific hybrid’s optical response is of primary interest.
Further development on that aspect can be found inS2of the Supplementary Information.
In this work, our approach consists in the theoretical prediction of the RIs of AgNW networks themselves using a combination of the Mie and van de Hulst (vdH) models, rather than in their experimental determination.
Both are fundamental models free of any fitting parameter and, when used together, allow for the prediction of the far-field optical response of well-defined nanostructures embedded in transparent dielectrics.
Considering the nanowires as cylinders, for which analytical solutions can be found by application of Mie’s theory, Manning et al. and Hamans et al. predicted the transmittance of such networks atnm [32,33] based on original research by Khanarian et al. [34].
However, Mie’s theory alone does not suffice for the determination of the RIs of the network.
To bridge that gap, Khanarian et al. pioneered the use of the vdH model for the description of AgNW networks embedded in a polymer matrix.
Despite the use of cylindrical nanowires in the model rather than pentagonal [35,36], Khanarian et al. showed the good agreement between the theoretical prediction of the ‘Mie + vdH’ model and the optical response of AgNW networks embedded in a transparent polymer matrix over visible wavelengths.
The present research aims to generalize the results of Khanarian et al. by predicting thenvalues of a AgNW network in air - its most general form -, in order to test further the validity of these combined models.
Furthermore, we explore a larger interval of wavelengths, spanning from the early visible to the NIR, such that the limits of the model can be determined and that the results can be exploited for many types of applications that are not restricted to the visible spectrum.
Finally, we also study the impact of the average nanowire diameter and of the network’s density, described in this article through the areal mass density (amd), on the predictions of such models.
Bothnandkcan be predicted using this model, but only the values ofkcan be compared to the experimentally determined ones due to the reasons previously detailed.
Consequently, in order to test the predicted values ofn, Fresnel’s equations were used to calculate the transmittance of the network based on the Mie-determined sets of (n,k) and compare it to the experimentally measured ones.
A schematic summary of our approach can be found in Fig.1, highlighting the key steps in our description of the optical properties of AgNW networks.
From there, the well-known identitycan be used to deduce the value ofT.
We note that the absorbanceAis not related to the scattering efficiencies that appear in Mie’s model but rather strictly quantifies the amount of power absorbed by the AgNW network given its refractive indices.
The transmittance of all samples decreases with increasing wavelength, an observation already made and explained by Atkinson et al. [39] as the consequence of the combined effect of(i)the increase of the RIs (bothnandk) of silver itself with increasing wavelength, leading to a simultaneous increased absorbance and reflectance of the nanowires themselves, and(ii)the average spacing size between the nanowires, which plays an important role in the transmission of light whose wavelengths are comparable or larger than the characteristic dimension of said gaps.
These effects also explain the dependence of the rate of the transmittance drop as a function of the wavelength, as thicker diameter NWs tend to have a lower imaginary part of the RI due to lower surface scattering effects, and have higher average spacings than smaller diameter nanowires.
From the curves in Fig.2, Eq.
(1) was used to deduce the imaginary coefficientkspectra of the networks as a function of the wavelength.
Figure3presents the empirically deducedkspectra alongside the predicted values obtained from the Mie+vdH model for varying nanowire diameters and densities.
A detailed examination reveals a general upward trend ofkwith increasing wavelength.
Notably, the slope of this trend intensifies with smaller nanowire diameters and higher densities.
This behavior can be attributed to the intrinsic optical properties of silver, which are well-approximated by Drude’s model [40].
The observed increase inkwith wavelength reflects the dissipative nature of the free electron response in metals.
At longer wavelengths, the interaction of free electrons with the electromagnetic field becomes more significant due to enhanced low-frequency scattering.
This scattering is a result of the increasing contribution of Ohmic losses, where longer electron oscillation periods (relative to the plasma frequency of silver, approximately[41]) amplify energy dissipation and absorption.
Such mechanisms are characteristic of the longer wavelength ranges explored in this study.
The influence of nanowire density onkis also evident.
As density increases, the areal filling fraction () of the network rises, leading to more pronounced metallic behavior [42].
This manifests as higherkvalues across the spectrum.
Similarly, variations in nanowire diameter significantly impactk.
Thinner nanowires result in shorter electron mean free paths due to more frequent interactions between free electrons and the nanowire surfaces.
This reduction in mean free path enhances energy dissipation, further increasingk.
Figure4shows the measured and theoretical transmittance curves, alongside the predictednvalues derived using the Mie+vdH model.
The gray area corresponds to the model predictions for a 20% variation in input nanowire density, accounting for the measurement uncertainty on this parameter.
A comparison between the theoretical transmittance of the network () and experimental data demonstrates fair agreement, particularly for networks with larger nanowire diameters () and at shorter wavelengths.
This enhanced matching between theory and experiment is attributed to the greater accuracy of the vdH model at shorter wavelengths relative to the structure size, addressing a known limitation of this theoretical framework.
At large wavelengths, when(size parameterwhereis the radius of the nanowires), deviations are observed between the model and the experimental results.
We attribute this breakdown to the limitations of van de Hulst’s mixing rule, which assumes independent scattering and relies on the anomalous diffraction approximation (ADT), both of which lose validity when the size parameter becomes small (), i.e. when the wavelength of the incident light becomes too large compared to the characteristic size of the nanostructure [38,43,44].
This constitutes a limitation to the models, not identified before, and which should be explicitly considered when simulating the optical properties of silver nanowire networks with this theoretical framework.
The observed increase innwith wavelength is distinctly different from the behavior of metallic thin films, wheretypically rises with wavelength.
This divergence underscores the hybrid nature of the nanowire network, necessitating consideration of its structural features to fully understand the observed physical trends.
A key factor influencing this behavior is the average gap size between nanowires.
As the ratio of the gap size to the incident wavelength grows, the optical response of the network increasingly resembles that of air rather than silver.
Consequently, for shorter wavelengths,napproaches 1, the refractive index of air.
Conversely, at longer wavelengths, the interaction between incident light and the network becomes more significant, causingnto deviate from 1 towards smaller values.
This interpretation also explains the observed decrease innwith increasing areal mass density (amd).
Denser networks, characterized by smaller gap sizes, exhibit more metallic-like optical properties, resulting innvalues closer to those of a silver thin film [45].
Additionally, the relationship between nanowire diameter and gap size provides further insight: as the diameter increases, the average gap size grows due to the reduced number of nanowires required to achieve the same areal density [39].
Thicker nanowires, associated with larger gaps, exhibit optical behavior closer to air, as reflected bynvalues approaching 1 and a slower decline with increasing wavelength.
These results highlight the nuanced interplay between the structural parameters of nanowire networks and their refractive index behavior, emphasizing the importance of both density and nanowire diameter in the shaping of their optical properties.
On a final note, the results obtained in this study for the refractive index can be considered from the perspective of their application in optical simulations.
Figure5illustrates the excellent agreement between the measured and predicted transmittance atnm (), a standard metric for characterizing the optical properties of AgNW networks.
The relative error across all datapoints remains below 10%, with accuracy improving as the nanowire diameter increases, consistent with the trends observed in Fig.4.
This strong correlation validates the use of our results as a reliable tool for the design of multilayer stacks incorporating AgNW networks.
The ability to accurately predict the optical properties of these networks enables precise fine-tuning of their behavior, offering significant potential for the design of advanced optical applications.
In summary, through the use of a comprehensive theoretical approach, we have predicted the refractive indices and optical transmittance of AgNW networks from the visible to the NIR spectra.
By combining Mie’s scattering theory, van de Hulst’s mixing model and Fresnel’s equations, we achieve a predictive framework validated by experimental data.
The model provides theoretical insights into the optical behavior of AgNW networks across the visible and NIR spectra, offering practical guidelines for optimizing these materials for diverse multimaterial applications.
Our results also originally evidence the non-trivial, hybrid optical behavior of AgNW networks, which cannot be understood solely by looking at the silver response, but rather by having to consider explicitly the composite nature of the material, which introduces effective medium effects.
We identified clear limitations to the use of these combined models, i.e. that the criterionshould be lower than 25 (size parameter) due to key approximations of the van de Hulst mixing model.
Future work could focus on extending this methodology to other heterogeneous TCMs including other metallic NW or carbon nanotube networks [46], and on exploring the influence of environmental factors such as oxidation on optical performance.
The integration of these models within device-level simulations, such as those using the Transfer Matrix Method, will further enhance their utility in designing advanced optoelectronic systems.
