Low back pain (LBP) is a leading global cause of disability, with the most significant burden now observed in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs).
Despite the growing availability of physiotherapy, cultural perceptions and systemic factors may hinder its utilisation in Bangladesh.
This study explores how patients with chronic LBP in Bangladesh perceive their condition and the role of physiotherapy.
Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, we conducted in‐depth semi‐structured interviews with 20 Bangladeshi adults (mean age 41.9 years) with chronic LBP (median duration 30 months).
Participants were purposively sampled to capture diverse sociodemographic perspectives.
Transcripts were thematically analysed to explore lived experiences with LBP and its management.
Four interrelated themes emerged: (1) there was limited understanding of the causes of LBP; (2) physician authority strongly influenced perceptions of physiotherapy, reinforcing passive treatment approaches; (3) friends and family, social media, and the internet shaped expectations; and (4) cultural and spiritual beliefs promoted traditional remedies over evidence‐based care.
As a result of these perceptions, physiotherapy was often viewed as a last resort and was typically limited to passive modalities.
Improving LBP care in Bangladesh may require culturally sensitive multilevel strategies, such as public education, upskilling of physiotherapists in active evidence‐based interventions, and health policy reforms, to promote the availability of direct physiotherapy access.
These strategies could help align patient expectations with contemporary care models and reduce LBP‐related disability in LMICs.
Low back pain (LBP) is a leading global public health problem that requires appropriate management to reduce the LBP‐induced physical and economic burden (Hartvigsen et al.2018).
Despite many treatment options, low back‐related disability and the population burden have increased worldwide (Foster et al.2018).
Once thought to be the problem of industrialised nations, recent evidence suggests that the most significant increases in disability attributable to LBP have occurred in low‐income and middle‐income countries (LMICs), including Asia, Africa, and the Middle East (Abbafati et al.2020).
Treatment approaches for LBP vary significantly in cost and clinical effectiveness (Foster et al.2018).
Contemporary clinical practice guidelines increasingly prioritise non‐pharmacological interventions over traditional medical or surgical options (Machado et al.2015; Qaseem et al.2017).
Recent guidelines from the USA, the UK and Denmark demonstrate a shift towards active, patient‐centred care, emphasising self‐management strategies, physical and psychological therapies, and evidence‐based complementary medicine while deprioritising pharmacological and surgical interventions (‘Overview| Low back pain and sciatica in over 16s: assessment and management | Guidance | NICE’; Qaseem et al.2017; Stochkendahl et al.2018).
These guidelines uniformly endorse exercise therapy and advocate for treatments addressing psychosocial factors and functional improvement (‘Overview| Low back pain and sciatica in over 16s: assessment and management | Guidance | NICE’; Qaseem et al.2017; Stochkendahl et al.2018).
In Bangladesh, LBP is common, with national estimates suggesting that one in five adults experience LBP at any given time (Ali et al.2020; Ali et al.2022a,2024; Majumder et al.2022).
Despite this high prevalence, little is known about how patients perceive LBP or physiotherapy in Bangladesh.
A recent mixed‐methods study involving 32 LMICs, including Bangladesh, found that people with LBP often first attempt self‐management strategies, such as home remedies (e.g., oil massage), over‐the‐counter pain medications, and care from traditional healers, including shamans, monks, bone setters, and astrologers (Sharma, Pathak, et al.2024; Sharma, Verhagen, et al.2024).
Passive therapies, particularly electrophysical modalities like short‐wave diathermy, have been frequently reported (Sharma, Pathak, et al.2024; Sharma, Verhagen, et al.2024).
Consistent with these findings, a national survey of physiotherapists in Bangladesh revealed that passive treatments dominate LBP care (Ali, Uddin, et al.2022).
Within the Bangladeshi healthcare system, physicians typically act as the primary gatekeepers, and although physiotherapists are legislatively permitted to practice autonomously, they are often restricted from doing so in practice (Mamin and Hayes2018).
How this healthcare structure shapes the experience of patients with chronic LBP remains unknown.
Additionally, traditional beliefs and limited access to diverse care options may influence patient expectations and care‐seeking behaviours.
Understanding these sociocultural and structural factors is crucial for informing LBP care strategies in Bangladesh.
Patient perceptions of physiotherapy for LBP vary significantly across countries and regions (Smuck et al.2022).
While systematic reviews indicate general acceptance of physiotherapy (Chou et al.2018), regional differences are apparent.
In North America, patients with LBP often prefer physician‐led care, while socioeconomic factors such as income, education, insurance status, and geographic location significantly influence access to physiotherapy services (Bath et al.2016; Sharpe et al.2021).
In contrast, Scandinavian research highlights a high level of trust in physiotherapists' diagnostic and exercise prescription skills (Unsgaard‐Tondel and Soderstrom2021).
British and Australian studies further demonstrate how social, experiential, and cultural factors shape expectations (Plank et al.2021).
However, this evidence relates exclusively to high‐income countries, leaving a critical knowledge gap regarding patient perceptions in LMICs such as Bangladesh, where healthcare systems and cultural contexts differ substantially.
Given the absence of qualitative data from Bangladesh and the documented differences in healthcare systems between high‐ and low‐income countries, this study seeks to understand how Bangladeshi people with chronic LBP perceive: (1) their low back pain condition, (2) physiotherapy as a potential treatment, and (3) the factors influencing their decision‐making about physiotherapy use.
Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, this study explores these perceptions among both treatment‐seeking patients and community‐dwelling individuals with LBP to provide foundational insights specific to the Bangladeshi context.
This qualitative study was grounded in a phenomenological framework and utilised an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach to examine how patients with chronic LBP perceive pain and physiotherapy.
IPA is a qualitative research approach that seeks to explore how individuals make sense of their personal and social experiences (Hartman et al.2024‐11; Smith et al.2015‐2).
This approach was deemed appropriate for this study as it enables in‐depth exploration of subjective experiences with LBP and physiotherapy in a culturally specific setting.
Ethical approval for the study was provided by the Health Research Ethics Committees of La Trobe University, Australia (HEC 22,831) and the Ethical Review Committee of Uttara Adhunik Medical College, Bangladesh (UAMC/ERC/Recommend‐ 04/2022).
The study is reported according to the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research (COREQ) guideline (Supporting InformationS1: Appendix I) (Tong et al.2007).
Purposive sampling methods were used to select diverse participants from the community with varying ages, genders, socioeconomic statuses, occupations, educational qualifications, and living locations.
Individuals with and without experience receiving physiotherapy were included in the sample to capture a wide range of views.
Participants were sought from the community via public posters, social media posts, and invitations extended directly to patients within the Uttara Adhunik Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh.
Potential participants were screened for eligibility, and all participants provided informed consent before participation.
The study targeted individuals living in Bangladesh with chronic LBP, defined as low back symptoms persisting for 3 months or more.
Participants were required to be Bangladeshi nationals aged 18–65 years with a primary complaint of LBP and/or referred leg pain, and willing to participate in a 30–45‐min voice‐recorded interview session.
Exclusion criteria included individuals currently or previously treated by the interviewer, pregnant women, and those with serious pathologies such as cancer.
IPA studies do not prescribe a fixed number of participants, and sample sizes in previous studies have ranged from a single participant to over 30 (Hale et al.2008).
However, IPA typically involves a small sample to enable detailed individual case analysis of interview data.
Unlike other qualitative methods, phenomenological research does not prioritise achieving data ‘saturation’ (Stensland and Sanders,2018).
Instead, Van Manen suggests focusing on gathering sufficient examples of concrete, lived experiences to explore the phenomenon's meaning rather than emphasising the total number of interviews (Max2016).
Therefore, we aimed to recruit 20 adults with chronic LBP based on feasibility and available resources.
In‐depth semi‐structured interviews explored individuals' perceptions of their condition and physiotherapy in chronic LBP.
Interviews were held in a private room within the Uttara Adhunik Medical College hospital compound, ensuring a safe space for participants to share their personal stories.
The interviews were conducted one‐on‐one, with no one else present during the sessions.
The first author (MA) conducted all interviews in Bangla, the participants' primary language.
The interviewer followed a flexible interview guide, allowing participants to share and expand upon relevant experiences as they arose (Supporting InformationS2: Appendix II).
The interview guide was collaboratively developed by the research team, which included two physiotherapists and a qualitative researcher, based on the literature review and study objectives.
No patients were involved in its development.
Each interview began with collecting socio‐demographic and clinical details, such as the duration of the participant's LBP, followed by an open‐ended question such as, ‘Could you start by telling me about your low back problem?’ Probing questions, such as ‘Can you explain any reasons that might have contributed to this?’, were used to clarify and expand on participants' responses.
A digital audio recorder, visible to participants, was used to record each session, which lasted between 20 and 40 min with an average duration of approximately 30 min.
Observational notes and field data were documented immediately after each interview.
Data collection took place between December 2023 and April 2024.
No repeated interviews were conducted.
All the interviews were conducted in Bangla.
The semi‐structured interview guide was first produced in English and reviewed by the co‐authors.
After that, the first author translated the guide into Bangla, with the translation verified by a professional linguist, a layman, and another bilingual co‐author (AH).
The first author transcribed the recorded audio verbatim in Bangla.
The transcripts were sent to the participants for verification via member checking.
Data were analysed using IPA.
Two authors (MA and AH) independently analysed the transcripts.
Working separately, they read the transcripts multiple times, annotated significant responses, and identified initial themes to capture the essential qualities of the data.
Following this, the themes were examined within the context of each transcript to identify shared ideas, group related concepts, and establish connections between them (Riipinen et al.2022).
The two authors then met to compare their findings.
Through this collaborative process, they refined the themes and developed a final set of master themes that reflected participants' perceptions and beliefs about their chronic LBP and its management.
To maintain accuracy of the patients' perceptions, the analysis was undertaken in the Bangla language.
Subsequently, essential quotes were translated into English for publication.
The true names of participants were not used in the manuscript to ensure privacy and anonymity.
Five researchers (MA, CLP, JJF, AH, and AJH) were involved in the data analysis and interpretation.
MA, CLP, JJF and AJH are physiotherapists, while AH is a biostatistician and public health researcher, Four researchers hold PhDs (CLP, JJF, AH, and AJH) and the other holds a MPhil (MA) and is a current PhD candidate.
CLP has extensive experience with qualitative research studies, while JJF, AJH, and MA have significant clinical expertise in LBP management.
MA and AH were born and raised in Bangladesh and are fluent in Bangla and English, facilitating cross‐cultural communication and data interpretation.
All the researchers were male except CLP.
MA, who conducted all interviews, was new to qualitative research but received extensive training and mentorship from AJH and CLP.
The analysis was undertaken independently by MA and AH, with mentorship from AJH, CLP, and JJF to ensure rigour and credibility.
None of the researchers were involved in the clinical care of the participants involved in the study, minimising potential bias in data collection and interpretation.
Eight female and 12 male participants (totaln= 20), aged between 22 and 65 years, were interviewed.
One other potential participant declined to be interviewed, citing shyness about being recorded; however, no participants withdrew during or after the interview process.
The median duration of LBP was 30 months, with a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 28 years.
The median LBP intensity was 7.5, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 on a 0‐10 scale.

Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants (n= 20).
An in‐depth analysis of the interviews, combined with phenomenological reflection, identified four key themes: (1) there was limited understanding of the causes of LBP; (2) physician authority strongly influenced perceptions of physiotherapy, reinforcing passive treatment approaches; (3) friends and family, social media and the internet shaped expectations and (4) cultural and spiritual beliefs prioritised traditional remedies over evidence‐based care.
These themes were interconnected, reflecting a complex interplay of personal beliefs, cultural traditions, social influence, and medical hierarchy shaping how individuals understand and manage their LBP (Figure1).
Main themes emerging from the perceptions of LBP and the role of physiotherapy among patients in Bangladesh.
Participants displayed a limited understanding of the causes of LBP, with their beliefs based on cultural and personal experiences rather than a comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms.
These beliefs influenced their initial reliance on traditional and non‐medical remedies, such as home treatments, spiritual rituals, or unauthorised therapies such as Seragem.
Social influences, including advice from family, friends, and social media networks, further guided their treatment decisions, while past experiences, social commentary, and the authoritative recommendations of physicians shaped perceptions of physiotherapy.
Despite varying expectations ranging from hopefulness to scepticism, physiotherapy was under‐utilised, with direct access being rare and typically pursued only after other options were exhausted.
I had to do a lot of work throughout the week…It feels like the problem arises when I work continuously for an hour without resting, especially while standing.
Not taking adequate rest seems to be the cause of the pain.
Most of my pain… started after my youngest daughter’s C‐section.
Since then, the pain has increased.
The injection used in my spine seems to have triggered the pain.
I couldn’t identify the exact reason for this pain in detail.
It might be due to a vitamin D deficiency since we mostly stay indoors.
No matter what treatment I try…the problem comes from my sitting job.
I realize I must quit this work.
At home, when I'm not under work pressure and just doing light chores, my pain remains manageable.
But whenever I return to this seated work, the pain comes back.
This has been my experience for years ‐ my pain is caused by my job, and if I continue like this, the problem will never go away.
This must be effective because the doctor recommended physiotherapy.
If it wasn’t good, they wouldn’t have suggested it.
I believe that I can recover through this.
The doctor advised me to take therapy for 15 days.
I have already undergone the necessary tests.
What additional tests will the therapist do?
No more tests are needed; the therapist just needs to follow the doctor's orders and provide physiotherapy.
I had already undergone all the necessary tests… When three doctors wanted to take me to the operating theatre, a doctor at (a clinic) suggested that I try (physio)therapy instead.
At that moment, I realized that therapy might help.
The doctor prescribed 15 days of therapy….
The above examples reveal the significant influence of physicians on patient's understanding of the nature and scope of physiotherapy practice in Bangladesh for managing LBP.
Physicians often issued direct orders for physiotherapy without scope for further assessment or treatment autonomy by the physiotherapist.
This views a physiotherapist more like a subordinate technician than a healthcare professional with their own clinical reasoning ability.
This dynamic reflects broader systemic and cultural hierarchies in healthcare delivery and may limit the development of physiotherapy as an independent, evidence‐based discipline in the Bangladeshi context.
Shaka, a 37‐year‐old participant, also described how the opinions of others discouraged him from pursuing physiotherapy.
Therapy needs to be done several days a week… like 3–4 days a week.
I’m also doubtful about how effective it will be.
I can’t really say… because the whole concept of physiotherapy isn’t clear to me—how it works or what it does.
From various sources, I’ve learned that you have to stick to it for 2–3 months, at least 3 months.
Physiotherapy treatment seems to be a long‐term process.
That’s why I haven’t been very interested in it.
I heard from people that physiotherapy could help reposition the disc in my spine and solve the nerve issue.
However, I am new to physiotherapy and don’t fully understand what it entails.
From what I’ve gathered, it involves exercises and possibly using weights to treat the issue.
I’m hopeful that this approach might bring me relief.
I came across some information on Facebook that suggested physiotherapy could be beneficial……….
These narratives show that acceptance of physiotherapy treatment for LBP in Bangladesh is heavily influenced by people sharing their experiences with others in person or online.
Cultural traditions, religious practices, and long‐standing social norms strongly influenced how participants approached treatment for chronic LBP.
These beliefs often served as the initial framework through which pain was interpreted and managed, leading many participants to rely on home remedies or traditional healing methods before considering formal healthcare.
Since the onset of my pain, I have relied on home remedies, such as warm compresses.
When I visit doctors, they prescribe MRIs and other expensive tests, which I don’t want to do.
I also avoid taking medicines because of their side effects.
Once, I went to a traditional healer who performed spiritual rituals, gave me blessed water, and blessed oil.
I tried those remedies while also seeking medical treatment from doctors.
This preference for traditional therapies may delay access to medical or physiotherapy care for people with chronic LBP in Bangladesh.
This study is the first IPA to explore perceptions of pain and physiotherapy among patients with chronic LBP in Bangladesh.
A combination of personal beliefs, cultural traditions, social influence, and medical recommendations all shape how individuals in Bangladesh understand and treat their LBP.
Many individuals failed to utilise physiotherapy because of an incomplete understanding of the causes of LBP and the predominance of traditional cultural treatments.
However, recommendations for physiotherapy by physicians, family, friends, and social media networks created an access pathway to try physiotherapy.
Chronic LBP is now understood as a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors (Hartvigsen et al.2018).
An understanding of the multifactorial nature of LBP was not apparent in Bangladeshi patients who reported an incomplete understanding of the causes of their LBP.
This in turn may present a barrier to accessing treatments such as physiotherapy capable of addressing multiple casual and contributing factors.
An example of this is the widespread belief in Bangladesh that epidural spinal injections administered during caesarean sections cause chronic LBP.
Although this procedure could be an individual trigger for acute LBP, a randomised controlled trial failed to show a causal connection between epidural anaesthesia during childbirth and ongoing chronic LBP (Howell et al.2002).
Limited conceptualisations of pain aetiology may prevent patients from accessing potentially effective multimodal interventions.
Public health education promoting the multifactorial nature of LBP could help shift understanding and treatment‐seeking behaviours towards more holistic approaches.
Patients' treatment choices were heavily influenced by cultural, social, and traditional beliefs in Bangladesh.
Many relied on traditional remedies, such as spiritual rituals, herbal treatments, or unregulated practices like Seragem therapy, which lack medical evidence and may even be harmful (Howell et al.2002).
Social influences, including advice from family, friends, and social media, further shaped their decisions about whether to access physiotherapy.
There may be an opportunity to gradually change perceptions of evidence‐based treatments such as physiotherapy by encouraging patients with positive experiences to share their stories with others in person or via social media.
Underutilisation of physiotherapy in Bangladesh appears to be partly driven by systemic barriers including limited public awareness and an over‐reliance on physician‐directed care pathways.
Within this physician‐dominated healthcare model, where doctors serve as the first point of contact for chronic LBP, physiotherapists are often relegated to executing prescribed passive modalities rather than autonomous practitioners who can implement evidence‐based care.
This model in turn may have hampered the adoption of evidence‐based treatment approaches by physiotherapists in Bangladesh.
This dynamic contributes to patient perceptions of physiotherapy as a last‐resort intervention focused primarily on passive treatments like heat therapy and ultrasound (Sharma, Pathak, et al.2024; Sharma, Verhagen, et al.2024), mirroring patterns observed in other LMICs where resource limitations and training gaps similarly constrain optimal practice (Sharma, Pathak, et al.2024; Sharma, Verhagen, et al.2024).
Despite regulatory provisions for direct access to physiotherapy services in Bangladesh, patients typically defer to physicians' authoritative recommendations (Mamin and Hayes2018), potentially preventing access to effective, evidence‐based care approaches.
Patient and physician education about the potential role of physiotherapy in managing LBP may be required individually and at a population level to change these perceptions about physiotherapy practice in Bangladesh.
Concurrently, upskilling physiotherapists to deliver a more effective individualised treatment for chronic LBP may also be required.
A limitation of this study is that patients were not involved in the development of the interview guide, which may have limited the topics they raised.
The use of purposive sampling, while appropriate for qualitative research, limits the generalisability of the findings to the broader population of individuals with chronic LBP in Bangladesh.
The data may also be influenced by recall bias or selective reporting as participants reflected on past experiences.
Finally, the study focused exclusively on individuals with chronic LBP, excluding those with acute or subacute symptoms, which may have limited the range of perspectives captured.
Nonetheless, some of these limitations are inherent to qualitative inquiry and were mitigated through methodological rigour, including reflexivity, diverse sampling, and member checking.
The findings offer valuable context‐specific insights into patient perceptions of pain and physiotherapy in Bangladesh.
This study provides insights into how cultural beliefs, social influences, and systemic barriers shape the perceptions and treatment decisions of patients with chronic LBP in Bangladesh.
Incomplete understanding of LBP aetiology, reliance on traditional or physician‐prescribed passive treatments, and limited awareness of evidence‐based physiotherapy were key barriers to accessing effective care.
Addressing these challenges may require coordinated public health strategies to improve health literacy, upskill physiotherapists in active, evidence‐based care, and implementation of system‐level reforms to increase utilisation of direct access to physiotherapy.
These findings also lay important groundwork for future research in LMICs on culturally responsive LBP management models.
