The intricate relationships between inflammatory pathways, diabetic nephropathy, and pituitary adenomas remain poorly understood.
This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the causal associations between inflammatory factors, diabetic nephropathy, and pituitary adenoma risk using Mendelian randomization approaches.
We conducted a systematic Mendelian randomization analysis employing multiple statistical methods including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted mode approaches.
A comprehensive inflammatory factor profile encompassing cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and immunoregulatory molecules was analyzed.
Sensitivity analyses including scatter plots and funnel plots were performed to validate the robustness of causal inferences.
The panoramic analysis revealed distinct inflammatory signatures associated with disease risk.
For pituitary adenomas, Neurotrophin-3 demonstrated significant protective effects (OR = 0.754, 95% CI: 0.583–0.975,P= 0.031), while programmed cell death 1 ligand emerged as a risk factor (OR = 1.320, 95% CI: 1.016–1.714,P= 0.037).
Regarding diabetic nephropathy, six inflammatory factors showed significant associations: CX3C-motif chemokine 1 (OR = 0.514,P= 0.049), interleukin-13 (OR = 0.822,P= 0.014), TNF-beta (OR = 0.903,P= 0.011), and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (OR = 0.905,P= 0.037) exhibited protective effects, whereas macrophage colony-stimulating factor (OR = 1.175,P= 0.026) and matrix metalloproteinase-10 (OR = 1.142,P= 0.030) increased disease risk.
Notably, no significant causal relationship was observed between diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma risk across all analytical methods.
This comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis reveals complex, disease-specific inflammatory networks underlying diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma pathogenesis.
Diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenomas exemplify complex multifactorial diseases that pose substantial global health burdens within the broader spectrum of chronic kidney disease and endocrine disorders [1–3].
The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy spans 20–40% among diabetic patients, establishing it as the predominant etiology of end-stage renal disease globally while simultaneously driving significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates.
Pituitary adenomas, despite their benign histological classification, generate considerable clinical morbidity via hormonal dysregulation or space-occupying effects, compromising patient quality of life and necessitating extended therapeutic management approaches [4–6].
Accumulating scientific evidence indicates that inflammatory mechanisms serve as fundamental drivers in the pathophysiology of both disease entities.
Within diabetic nephropathy, persistent inflammatory responses marked by dysregulated cytokine profiles, chemokine activation, and aberrant growth factor signaling precipitate glomerular damage, promote tubulointerstitial scarring, and accelerate functional renal deterioration.
This inflammatory network encompasses intricate crosstalk among metabolic dysregulation, oxidative injury, and immunological activation, culminating in continuous tissue damage and compromised regenerative capacity [7–9].
In contrast, pituitary adenoma pathogenesis demonstrates increasing associations with inflammatory mediators that potentially modulate neoplastic initiation, tumor advancement, and treatment response patterns.
Nevertheless, the precise inflammatory profiles characterizing these conditions and their putative causal interconnections remain insufficiently characterized.
Conventional observational research examining inflammatory biomarkers in disease etiology frequently encounters limitations including reverse causality, uncontrolled confounding factors, and environmental influences that may mask authentic causal associations.
Mendelian randomization methodology represents an innovative analytical strategy employing genetic polymorphisms as instrumental variables to establish causal relationships between exposures and health outcomes.
Through exploitation of genetic variant randomization occurring during conception, MR investigations can reduce confounding bias and generate robust causal evidence, particularly valuable for biomarker-disease relationship assessments [10–12].
Although inflammation’s significance in diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma development is well-recognized, multiple critical research gaps persist.
Initially, distinguishing inflammatory factors that directly contribute to disease susceptibility from those representing secondary consequences remains unresolved.
Additionally, systematic exploration of potential inflammatory pathway interconnections between these apparently disparate conditions has not been undertaken.
Furthermore, determining whether diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenomas exhibit shared inflammatory mechanisms versus independent pathophysiological trajectories requires clarification.
Using this comprehensive analytical framework, our investigation aimed to enhance understanding of inflammatory network dynamics within these clinically significant conditions and provide foundational knowledge for developing precision medicine approaches that target inflammation-driven disease pathways.
Our investigation utilized a comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization analytical framework to explore causal associations among inflammatory factors, diabetic nephropathy, and pituitary adenoma susceptibility.
Methodological implementation adhered to STROBE-MR (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology using Mendelian Randomization) reporting standards to maintain analytical rigor and ensure transparent documentation [13–15].
The analytical approach leveraged genetic instruments extracted from extensive genome-wide association studies conducted within European ancestry populations to mitigate population stratification confounding.
Genetic instruments representing inflammatory factors were sourced from publicly accessible GWAS repositories, incorporating an extensive spectrum of biomarkers spanning cytokines (interleukins, tumor necrosis factors), chemokines (CX3C-motif chemokines), growth factors (neurotrophin-3), colony-stimulating factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and immunoregulatory molecules (programmed cell death 1 ligand).
Summary data originated from investigations encompassing sample sizes between 3000 and 31,000 participants, varying according to specific biomarker availability, thereby providing sufficient statistical power for robust causal inference.
Diabetic nephropathy summary statistics were extracted from the most comprehensive available GWAS meta-analysis, incorporating approximately 19,406 affected individuals and 231,194 unaffected controls of European descent.
The diabetic nephropathy phenotype was characterized by chronic kidney disease presence (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria) among diabetes mellitus patients, ensuring clinical applicability and diagnostic accuracy.
Pituitary adenoma genetic data were obtained from an extensive GWAS that initially included both benign pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.
For the purpose of this study, we restricted the analysis to pituitary adenoma cases only, excluding craniopharyngiomas to avoid heterogeneity.
The final dataset comprised approximately 2000 affected cases and 200,000 unaffected controls of European ancestry.
The investigation incorporated diverse pituitary tumor subtypes to achieve comprehensive representation of pituitary neoplasm pathophysiology while enhancing result generalizability.
Genetic instruments underwent selection based on established MR criteria designed to fulfill the three fundamental assumptions: relevance, independence, and exclusion restriction.
The selection protocol implemented rigorous standards including genome-wide significance requirements ofP< 5 × 10⁻⁸, linkage disequilibrium pruning with r² < 0.001 across 10,000 kb windows, and minimum F-statistic thresholds > 10 to prevent weak instrument bias [16–18].
Variants demonstrating linkage disequilibrium with established pleiotropic loci underwent systematic exclusion to reduce potential MR assumption violations.
Exposure and outcome datasets received careful harmonization to maintain consistent effect allele coding throughout all analyses.
Palindromic single nucleotide polymorphisms exhibiting intermediate allele frequencies were removed to avoid strand misalignment complications.
In instances where direct instrument SNPs were absent from outcome datasets, proxy SNPs demonstrating high linkage disequilibrium (r² >0.8) served as replacements, preserving genetic association strength while maintaining analytical integrity.
The inverse variance weighted approach constituted the primary analytical methodology, delivering optimal precision under assumptions of absent horizontal pleiotropy.
Effect magnitudes were reported as odds ratios (OR) accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (CI), with statistical significance established atP< 0.05 [19,20].
This methodology effectively integrates information from multiple genetic variants to generate robust causal estimates.
Additional complementary MR methodologies were implemented to evaluate causal estimate robustness and examine underlying assumptions.
MR-Egger regression generated causal estimates resistant to directional horizontal pleiotropy while testing pleiotropy presence via intercept term evaluation.
The weighted median approach produced consistent estimates when up to 50% of instruments demonstrated invalidity, providing protection against outlying variant effects.
The weighted mode methodology delivered consistent estimates when the largest instrument subset with comparable causal estimates represented valid instruments.
This study employed the Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighted (MR IVW) method to analyze the causal relationship between inflammation-related factors and pituitary adenoma risk.
The results demonstrated that Neurotrophin-3 levels were significantly negatively associated with pituitary adenoma risk, with an odds ratio of 0.754 (95% confidence interval: 0.583–0.975,P= 0.031), suggesting that Neurotrophin-3 may have a protective effect against pituitary adenomas.
Conversely, programmed cell death 1 ligand levels showed a positive correlation with pituitary adenoma risk, with an odds ratio of 1.320 (95% confidence interval: 1.016–1.714,P= 0.037), indicating that this factor may be a risk factor for pituitary adenoma development.
These findings provide important genetic evidence for understanding the role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas (Fig.1).
This study conducted a systematic Mendelian randomization analysis of a large panel of inflammation-related biomarkers and pituitary adenoma risk.
The circular plot displays the analytical results of an inflammatory factor profile including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and immunoregulatory molecules.
Through P-value heat map coloring, multiple inflammatory factors showed significant associations with pituitary adenoma risk, with factors marked in red reaching statistical significance levels.
This panoramic analysis reveals the complex role patterns of inflammatory networks in pituitary adenoma pathogenesis, providing important genetic epidemiological evidence for understanding the inflammatory pathological mechanisms of pituitary adenomas, while establishing a foundation for identifying potential therapeutic targets (Fig.2).
This study employed multiple Mendelian randomization methods to evaluate the causal relationship between pituitary adenoma and diabetic nephropathy risk.
The analysis results showed no significant associations across three statistical approaches: the MR Egger method revealed an odds ratio of 0.990 (95% confidence interval: 0.946–1.036,P= 0.638), the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method showed an odds ratio of 1.008 (95% confidence interval: 0.947–1.072,P= 0.813), and the weighted mode method demonstrated an odds ratio of 1.043 (95% confidence interval: 0.945–1.152,P= 0.424).
All odds ratios were close to 1 with P-values greater than 0.05, indicating no significant genetic causal relationship between benign pituitary tumors and diabetic nephropathy risk (Fig.3).
This study systematically evaluated the causal relationships between multiple inflammatory factors and diabetic nephropathy risk using the Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighted method.
The results revealed significant associations between six inflammatory factors and diabetic nephropathy risk.
Among these, CX3C-motif chemokine 1 (OR = 0.514,P= 0.049), interleukin-13 (OR = 0.822,P= 0.014), TNF-beta (OR = 0.903,P= 0.011), and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (OR = 0.905,P= 0.037) demonstrated protective effects, potentially reducing diabetic nephropathy risk.
Conversely, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (OR = 1.175,P= 0.026) and matrix metalloproteinase-10 (OR = 1.142,P= 0.030) appeared as risk factors, potentially increasing diabetic nephropathy susceptibility.
These findings reveal the complex regulatory role of inflammatory networks in diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis (Fig.4).
This study employed multiple Mendelian randomization methods to explore the potential causal relationship between diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma risk.
Based on analysis with 22 instrumental variables, three statistical approaches showed no significant associations: the MR Egger method revealed an odds ratio of 1.080 (95% confidence interval: 0.909–1.283,P= 0.394), the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method showed an odds ratio of 0.994 (95% confidence interval: 0.906–1.089,P= 0.880), and the weighted mode method demonstrated an odds ratio of 1.063 (95% confidence interval: 0.942–1.200,P= 0.330).
All odds ratios were close to 1 with P-values greater than 0.05, indicating no significant genetic causal relationship between diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma risk, suggesting that within the statistical power of the present study these two diseases show no evidence of a direct causal link at the genetic level (Fig.5).
This study employed a multi-layered Mendelian randomization analytical framework to comprehensively validate the research hypothesis.

Different colored regression lines represent results from various analytical approaches, validating the robustness of causal inference.
Figure6D shows a funnel plot analysis used to assess horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity, with scatter distribution patterns helping identify potential violations of MR assumptions.
The overall analytical results indicate that the instrumental variables employed did not show evidence of major violations of MR assumptions, providing supportive genetic evidence for causal inference.
Our comprehensive Mendelian randomization investigation delivers robust genetic evidence demonstrating the intricate roles of inflammatory networks within diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma pathogenesis.
These findings unveil disease-specific inflammatory patterns that contradict conventional perspectives viewing inflammation as a ubiquitous pathogenic mechanism across diverse medical conditions.
The discovery of Neurotrophin-3’s protective function against pituitary adenomas (OR = 0.754,P= 0.031), coupled with evidence of six distinct inflammatory factors causally linked to diabetic nephropathy susceptibility, constitutes a substantial breakthrough in comprehending the molecular foundations of these conditions.
Our results establish the inaugural systematic genetic evidence characterizing the causal inflammatory landscape within these clinically significant diseases.
Neurotrophin-3’s protective influence against pituitary adenoma development corresponds with evolving knowledge regarding neurotrophic factors as cellular homeostasis regulators and tumor suppression mediators.
While Neurotrophin-3 is predominantly recognized for its neuronal development and survival functions, mounting evidence highlights its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic capabilities across various malignancies.
Within pituitary contexts, Neurotrophin-3 potentially regulates intricate interactions among hypothalamic control mechanisms, pituitary cellular proliferation, and hormonal feedback systems.
The substantial protective effect documented in our investigation indicates that therapeutic interventions targeting neurotrophic pathways may constitute innovative approaches for pituitary adenoma prevention or management, especially considering current medical treatment limitations for specific pituitary tumor variants [21–23].
Interleukin-13’s identification as a protective element (OR = 0.822,P= 0.014) against diabetic nephropathy offers crucial insights regarding the immunological foundations of kidney disease advancement.
Although interleukin-13 traditionally correlates with Th2 immune reactions and allergic inflammation, it demonstrates renoprotective properties that potentially counterbalance the predominantly pro-inflammatory milieu characterizing diabetic kidney disease [24–26].
This discovery reinforces the developing understanding that inflammatory mediators do not uniformly contribute to tissue destruction; some may function as endogenous protective mechanisms.
TNF-beta and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine’s protective functions further underscore cytokine network complexity, wherein cytokine family members can exert opposing influences on disease progression.
Implementing Mendelian randomization methodology within this investigation addresses fundamental constraints of conventional observational research in inflammatory biomarker studies.
Contrasting with traditional epidemiological methods vulnerable to reverse causation and confounding, our genetic instrumental variable strategy provides causal relationship evidence less affected by environmental influences, lifestyle alterations, or disease-related biomarker level changes.
Employing genetic variants as lifelong exposure proxies to varying inflammatory factor levels delivers unique perspectives into long-term inflammatory pathway modulation consequences, directly impacting therapeutic intervention strategies.
Simultaneous comprehensive analysis of multiple inflammatory factors, visualized through circular plotting methodologies, represents methodological progress capturing inflammatory network interconnectedness.
This panoramic framework transcends single-biomarker analyses, providing systems-level understanding of how diverse inflammatory pathways collectively influence disease susceptibility.
Disease-specific inflammatory signature identification suggests precision medicine approaches targeting inflammation should be customized to specific pathophysiological contexts rather than implementing universal anti-inflammatory strategies.
Causal relationships identified within our analysis present validated drug development targets.
Neurotrophin-3’s protective function against pituitary adenomas suggests neurotrophic factor supplementation or pathway activation may represent novel therapeutic approaches.
Regarding diabetic nephropathy, inflammatory factor effects’ dual nature indicates future anti-inflammatory treatments should incorporate precision design, potentially preserving or enhancing protective inflammatory responses while targeting detrimental pathways.
The absence of significant causal relationships between diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma risk across all analytical approaches provides valuable pathophysiological insights.
Despite both conditions involving inflammatory processes and potentially shared risk factors including metabolic dysfunction, our genetic evidence indicates these diseases develop through predominantly independent pathways.
This finding carries clinical practice implications, suggesting one condition’s presence does not substantially modify genetic susceptibility to the other, enabling independent disease management strategy development without shared pathogenic mechanism concer.
Our analysis was confined to European ancestry populations, potentially limiting result generalizability to other ethnic groups due to differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns, allele frequencies, and genetic architecture.
Population-specific genetic variants and their effect sizes may differ substantially across ancestries, potentially altering causal relationships identified in our study.
The Mendelian randomization approach assumes linear lifelong effects of genetic variants, which may inadequately capture complex temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes or age-specific effects with clinical relevance.
Inflammatory factor effects may vary across life stages, developmental periods, or disease progression phases, nuances not captured by our population-level genetic analysis.
The pituitary adenoma dataset’s relatively small sample size (approximately 2000 cases vs. 200,000 controls) compared to diabetic nephropathy (19,406 cases vs. 231,194 controls) may result in insufficient statistical power for detecting subtle but clinically meaningful associations.
This limitation particularly affects our ability to identify small-to-moderate effect sizes that might be therapeutically relevant.
This comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis provides robust genetic evidence for complex, disease-specific inflammatory networks underlying diabetic nephropathy and pituitary adenoma pathogenesis.
Our findings demonstrate that Neurotrophin-3 exerts significant protective effects against pituitary adenoma development, while programmed cell death 1 ligand represents a risk factor, revealing novel therapeutic targets for pituitary neoplasm management.
