Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for 90% of primary liver malignancies and ranks as the fourth leading cause of global cancer mortality.
DNA methylation drives HCC pathogenesis by orchestrating tumor suppressor silencing and oncogenic pathway activation, fundamentally governing tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance.
While alterations in white blood cell counts have emerged as independent prognostic indicators in HCC progression, their causal relationship with tumor epigenetics remains unclear.
Given that HCC tumors actively secrete cytokines and remodel systemic immunity through epigenetic mechanisms, peripheral white blood cell dynamics serve as a compelling surrogate for studying tumor-driven immune dysregulation and identifying methylation-based therapeutic targets.
We integrated DNA methylation profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) with summary statistics from six genome-wide association studies of white blood cell counts.
Using these data, we applied a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework to systematically investigate the causal effects of HCC-related CpG sites on white blood cell counts.
The robustness of our findings was established through stringent criteria, comprehensive sensitivity analyses, and Bayesian colocalization, followed by functional validation with TCGA data and a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS).
Our analysis identified 26 HCC-specific CpG sites with causal effects on white blood cell counts.
A multi-step validation pipeline integrating Bayesian colocalization and tumor-specific expression analysis robustly confirmed three core mediator genes:BTN3A2,TRIM27, andS100A12.
TWAS provided independent, gene-level validation, revealingBTN3A2as a powerful regulator of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts,TRIM27as a key immunometabolic checkpoint, andS100A12as a modulator of innate immunity.
This study establishes epigenome-immune crosstalk in HCC by identifyingBTN3A2,S100A12andTRIM27as central methylation-immunoregulatory hubs.
The discovered methylation-immune axes provide mechanistic insights for developing combination therapies targeting epigenetic checkpoints to reverse immunosuppressive microenvironments in advanced HCC.

Liver cancer claims over 830,000 lives annually, ranking as the fourth leading cause of global cancer mortality, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constituting 90% of primary liver malignancies [1–3].
Despite therapeutic advances, the 5-year survival rate remains dismal at 22%, underscoring the urgent need for novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets [1].
White blood cell counts alterations, a hallmark of systemic inflammation, exhibit dual roles in oncogenesis: tumor-related leukocytosis (TRL) with elevated counts correlates with 38% increased recurrence risk in HCC patients [4,5], while treatment-induced leukopenia associates with compromised anti-tumor immunity [6,7].
These bidirectional changes reflect complex tumor-immune interactions mediated through cellular density, subtype composition, and functional polarization of white blood cells [8].
Recent Mendelian randomization studies have established a genetic causal relationship between specific immune cell subtypes and primary liver cancer.
For example, elevated CD3 on CD45RA + CD4 + T cells increases HCC risk, while higher CD80 expression on monocytes is protective [9].
Epigenetic regulation, particularly DNA methylation, is pivotal in HCC pathogenesis.
It functions as a critical layer of gene control, orchestrating the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenic pathways [10,11].
This “language” of chromatin modification contributes significantly to the inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and cellular plasticity that enable tumors to adapt, progress, and develop resistance to therapy [12].
Consequently, aberrant methylation patterns are now recognized as powerful biomarkers obtainable through liquid biopsies, offering valuable information for HCC diagnosis and guiding therapeutic decisions [10].
Given that HCC tumors actively remodel their microenvironment and induce systemic effects [13], alterations in peripheral white blood cell counts serve as a compelling surrogate for studying the downstream consequences of tumor epigenetics.
The epigenetic state of a tumor can modulate the secretion of cytokines and other signaling molecules [14], which in turn influence hematopoiesis and systemic immune responses [15].
This creates a plausible causal link between tumor-specific epigenetic events and observable changes in peripheral immunity.
Indeed, emerging evidence suggests extrahepatic epigenetic regulation of hematopoiesis - PEAR1 hypomethylation increases platelet-white blood cell aggregation, exacerbating cancer- inflammation [16].
However, the causal interplay between HCC-specific methylation patterns and white blood cell dynamics remains uncharted territory, particularly regarding subtype-specific regulation.
This knowledge gap hinders the development of epigenetic therapies targeting the tumor-immune axis, especially given the heterogeneous response to current PD-1 inhibitors across HCC molecular subtypes [17].
Mendelian randomization (MR) overcomes observational study limitations by using genetic variants as instrumental variables, effectively disentangling causation from confounding [18].
However, traditional MR applications in oncology often neglect tumor tissue specificity and treatment effect modifiers.
Our study applied two-sample MR coupled with colocalization analysis - which identifies shared causal variants across omics layers [19] - to investigate causal effects of HCC-related CpG sites on six white blood cell subtypes.
By integrating multi-ancestry GWAS data for six distinct white blood cell subtypes (with sample sizes ranging up to 519,288 individuals, see TableS1) with TCGA epigenomic profiles, we bridge the critical gap between HCC epigenetics and systemic immune remodeling.
This approach enables identification of methylation markers predictive of immunotherapy response, addressing a key limitation in current HCC precision medicine.
This integrative study leveraged the TCGA-LIHC methylation dataset and harmonized it with genome-wide association data from six independent cohorts to investigate the immune-epigenetic interplay in HCC.
Following stringent quality control, we systematically identified HCC-related DMPs and employed two-sample Mendelian randomization to elucidate causal relationships between tumor-specific DNA methylation patterns and systemic white blood cell counts.
To ensure robust causal inference, we implemented sensitivity analyses and advanced Bayesian colocalization frameworks to disentangle shared genetic architectures (Fig.1).
This multidimensional approach addresses a critical gap in understanding how epigenetic dysregulation in HCC may systemically influence immune homeostasis.
The GWAS datasets utilized in this study are publicly accessible and ethically compliant for secondary analysis.
Summary statistics for immune-related traits were obtained from the MRC IEU OpenGWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/), which provides open-access data under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0) [20].
HCC genetic association data were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), in accordance with the TCGA Data Use Agreement.
All data are de-identified and aggregated, adhering to ethical guidelines for human genomic research.
No institutional review board (IRB) approval was required, as this study exclusively employed summary-level data with no individual participant identifiers.
HCC methylation profiles were retrieved from the TCGA-LIHC cohort via the GDC, comprising 485,577 CpG sites profiled on the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array.
Preprocessing and normalization were performed using the ChAMP pipeline (R v4.3.1), applying BMIQ correction to mitigate technical biases in beta-value distributions [21].
DMPs were defined by stringent thresholds (|Δβ| >0.4,P-adjust < 5 × 10− 7), ensuring selection of biologically significant epigenetic alterations.
Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) meeting epigenome-wide significance (P< 5 × 10− 8) were curated from the GoDMC consortium to establish genetic instruments [22].
The white blood cell counts genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets (TableS1) integrated observations from diverse populations, including: total white blood cell counts derived from exome sequencing of 444,734 Europeans [23]; lymphocyte counts analyzed genome-wide in 408,112 Europeans [24]; neutrophil counts assessed through a trans-ancestry meta-analysis (including 519,288 Europeans) [25]; monocyte counts from the BioBank Japan cohort (n= 349,856) [26]; and eosinophil/basophil data from multi-ethnic cohorts encompassing European and Japanese populations [27,28].
To investigate causal relationships between HCC- related DNA methylation and white blood cell counts (including subtypes), we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
HCC-related CpG site methylation levels were defined as exposures, with their single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) serving as instrumental variables (IVs).
Effect estimates (BETA), standard errors (SE), allele frequencies, and directional information for each SNP were extracted.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for white blood cell counts and subtypes were analyzed as outcomes using the “TwoSampleMR” R package [29] (FigureS1).
To mitigate pleiotropy and weak instrument bias, stringent criteria were applied: IVs were restricted to SNPs with genome-wide significance (P< 5 × 10− 8) and robust instrument strength (F> 10).
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was controlled (r² < 0.01).
Single-SNP associations were evaluated via Wald ratio estimation, while exposures linked to multiple independent methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) were analyzed using inverse variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis as the primary method.
False discovery rate (FDR) correction addressed multiple testing.
Sensitivity analyses enhanced result reliability.
To address potential reverse causality between white blood cell counts and HCC methylation, we conducted MR Steiger directionality tests [30].
We then used GTEx v10 data to functionally annotate these CpG sites, prioritizing gene targets based on eQTL significance and immune function.
To elucidate whether the observed genetic associations between HCC-related DNA methylation sites and white blood cell counts (including subtypes) were driven by shared causal mechanisms, we implemented a Bayesian colocalization framework [19].
This approach rigorously evaluates the probability that two traits—here, methylation levels and hematological parameters—are influenced by the same underlying genetic variant within a defined genomic region.
H₀: No association between the genomic region and either methylation or white blood cell counts.
H₁/H₂: Association with DNA methylation or white blood cell counts alone.
H₃: Independent causal variants driving associations for both traits.
H₄: A single causal variant jointly influencing both traits.
A posterior probability threshold ofPPH4​>80% was adopted to declare strong colocalization evidence, aligning with recommendations for robust genetic epidemiology studies [19].
This stringent threshold helps to differentiate between the hypothesis of a single shared causal variant influencing both traits (H₄, suggesting pleiotropy) and the hypothesis of two distinct causal variants in linkage disequilibrium (H₃).
To extend our investigation of shared genetic architecture across multiple hematological traits, we applied HyPrColoc [31]—a Bayesian clustering algorithm optimized for high-dimensional colocalization.
This method addresses key limitations of pairwise analyses by simultaneously evaluating colocalization patterns across all white blood cell subtypes (neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, eosinophil counts) and methylation sites, while accounting for potential heterogeneity in effect directions between studies.
The analysis incorporated three critical safeguards: Regression coefficients for methylation and cell counts were derived from independent GWAS cohorts, eliminating confounding by sample overlap.
The algorithm partitions loci into clusters where traits share a common causal variant, even when multiple variants exist in LD.
Thesensitive.plot()function evaluated robustness across prior probability thresholds (default:p1​=1e− 4,p2​=1e− 4,p12​=1e− 5), ensuring findings were not contingent on specific parameter choices.
Genomic windows mirrored the single-trait colocalization settings (± 500 kb).
A posterior probabilityPP> 80% was considered definitive evidence for multi-trait colocalization, whilePP> 50% indicated suggestive evidence requiring replication.
This hierarchical approach balances discovery of novel associations with stringent control over false positives, particularly important given the polygenic nature of both immune cell regulation and carcinogenesis.
To systematically compare methylation effects across different white blood cell subtypes, we summarized all CpG-trait associations that passed a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of < 0.05 in a comprehensive heatmap.
Hierarchical clustering, using Euclidean distance and the complete linkage method, was applied to both the CpG sites and the white blood cell traits to identify patterns of shared (pleiotropic) and lineage-specific regulatory effects.
For biological validation within a cancer context, we performed an integrative analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) cohort.
Gene expression data (STAR-Counts) were downloaded and processed using the TCGAbiolinks R package, while DNA methylation data (Illumina HumanMethylation450K) were obtained from the UCSC Xena platform.
We then estimated immune cell abundance from the tumor expression data using the EPIC deconvolution algorithm, as implemented in the immunedeconv R package.
Finally, Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationships between lead CpG site methylation (beta values), target gene expression (log2-transformed counts), and the abundance of immune cell infiltrates.
The functional implications of the associated genes were explored through pathway enrichment analysis.
A curated list of genes identified in our primary analysis was subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis using the clusterProfiler R package.
The background gene set was defined as all genes annotated on the Illumina 450 K array to avoid bias.
Pathways with a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered significant.
Furthermore, to visualize the functional connections between these genes, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape software.
Finally, to provide independent, gene-level evidence for causality, a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) was conducted using the FUSION software [32].
We leveraged pre-computed whole-blood expression models from the GTEx v8 project to test for associations between genetically predicted gene expression across select chromosomes and the GWAS summary statistics for each major white blood cell subtype.
The results for our key candidate genes were then specifically examined, with a Bonferroni correction applied to account for multiple testing across these genes and traits.
Analysis of the TCGA-LIHC dataset using the ChAMP package identified 3,646 DMPs significantly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (TableS2, FigureS2).
Among these, 333 DMPs (9.13%) exhibited hypomethylation, while 3,313 (90.87%) showed hypermethylation, reflecting substantial epigenetic reprogramming in HCC.
Integration with the GoDMC database revealed 311,394 methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) linked to these sites (P< 5 × 10⁻⁸).
After harmonization, clumping (r² = 0.01, 10 Mb window), and exclusion of mQTLs with weak instrumental variables (F< 10), 2,503 robust mQTLs were retained for Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis (TableS3).
Our two-sample MR analysis identified numerous CpG sites with significant causal effects on white blood cell counts and their subtypes after FDR correction (FDR < 0.05).
All significant associations passed MR Steiger directionality tests, confirming the causal direction from methylation to white blood cell traits (Table S4).
To systematically compare the regulatory landscape across white blood cell subtypes, we visualized all significant CpG-trait associations in a heatmap with hierarchical clustering (Fig.2).
The analysis revealed a landscape dominated by associations with lymphocytes and neutrophils, while effects on basophils were notably sparse, a pattern also evident from the distribution of significant sites (Fig.3B).
Hierarchical clustering effectively segregated lineage-specific effects from shared (pleiotropic) effects.
For instance, a prominent cluster of CpG sites was exclusively associated with decreased lymphocyte counts, indicating a targeted regulatory mechanism.
In contrast, we identified numerous CpG sites with pleiotropic effects.
An UpSet plot analysis quantified this cross-talk, revealing 19 CpG sites with effects on two or more subtypes (Fig.3C, Table S5).
An example is cg18803104 which was associated with increased counts across lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils, suggesting its role as a central regulatory hub in hematopoiesis.
Bayesian colocalization analysis of MR-identified CpG sites (restricted to loci with > 30 SNPs) revealed 5 CpG sites with colocalization posterior probability (PPH4) > 50%, suggesting shared causal variants between methylation and WBC traits (FigureS3, Table S6).
Seven sites exhibited strong colocalization evidence (PPH4> 80%): cg07370087 (PPH4= 0.94), cg15934095 (PPH4= 1.00), cg16563134 (PPH4= 0.88), cg14588682 (PPH4= 0.84), cg08548066 (PPH4= 0.82), cg10103850 (PPH4= 0.95), and cg01947943 (PPH4= 1.00) (Fig.4, Table S6).
GTEx database interrogation identified four colocalized mQTLs as blood tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) forS100A12,MDM1,BTN3A2, andTRIM27(Table S8).
HyPrColoc analysis of the 19 cross-subtype CpG sites (excluding loci with < 30 SNPs or low SNP-driven variance explanation [posterior_explained_by_SNP< 0.8]) yielded no multi-trait clusters with posterior probability (PP) > 80%.
However, suggestive colocalization signals were observed for three loci: cg07370087 (S100A12) with neutrophil/monocyte counts (PP= 0.62), cg08548066 (BTN3A2) with lymphocyte/neutrophil/monocyte counts (PP= 0.80), and cg10119082 (ARPC1B) with lymphocyte/neutrophil counts (PP= 0.64) (Fig.5, Table S7).
Notably,S100A12andBTN3A2overlapped with findings from standard colocalization analysis.
Sensitivity analysis supported robust clustering for neutrophil/monocyte counts with cg08548066-linked lymphocyte/neutrophil associations, while other trait combinations showed weaker evidence (Figure S4).
Validation analysis within the TCGA-LIHC cohort anchored our findings in HCC-specific biology, confirming that identified epigenetic loci regulate their target genes within the tumor.
For instance, methylation at cg08548066 was significantly negatively correlated withBTN3A2expression (R= -0.18,p= 8 × 10⁻4, Figure S5, Table S9).
Furthermore, the expression of these genes was strongly associated with immune cell infiltration.
Notably,TRIM27expression showed a robust negative correlation with total white blood cell abundance (R= -0.26,p= 4.4 × 10⁻7, Figure S6, Table S10), providing direct evidence linking tumor-specific epigenetic alterations to the local immune landscape.
Enrichment analysis of genes mapped from significant CpG sites clarified their biological context, revealing a functional concentration in immune regulation.
Core pathways such as “Antigen processing and presentation” and “regulation of lymphocyte activation” were highly enriched (Fig.6), confirming the immunomodulatory role of the identified loci.
Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) linked our candidate genes to circulating immune cell levels.
ForBTN3A2, whose predicted expression was powerfully associated with increased lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts, and forTRIM27, which showed the opposite effect with a strong link to decreased levels of the same cell types.
Meanwhile, predictedS100A12expression was associated with fewer neutrophils but more monocytes, whileMDM1andARPC1Bwere specifically linked to increased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, respectively.
Through comprehensive multi-omics investigation, we elucidated three pivotal mechanisms regulating HCC-related immune dysregulation, which are intrinsically linked to white blood cell counts alterations and epigenetic remodeling.
Epigenetic modifications play pivotal roles in orchestrating malignant behaviors including tumor proliferation, metastatic dissemination, and therapeutic resistance, with DNA methylation serving as both prognostic biomarkers and functional regulators in HCC progression [14,33,34].
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by aberrant white blood cell infiltration - particularly tumor-associated macrophages, CXCR2 + neutrophils, and dysfunctional lymphocytes - establishes a permissive niche for immune evasion and tumor promotion [4,35].
Our methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis established a causal association between HCC-related DNA methylation alterations and peripheral white blood cell counts, identifying seven CpG sites with compelling evidence across molecular subtypes.
Our study predicted five mechanistically important loci associated with three potential functional modules controlling HCC-related white blood cell counts.
Subsequent validation in the TCGA-LIHC cohort and through TWAS robustly confirmed three core mediator genes—BTN3A2,TRIM27, andS100A12.
Two other candidates,MDM1andARPC1B, showed associations with immune cell counts in TWAS but lacked confirmation for the intra-tumoral epigenetic-to-expression link, marking them as subjects for future investigation.
Clinically, these methylation markers not only stratify patients by TME characteristics and survival outcomes [34], but also suggest actionable targets for combination immunotherapy.
Specifically, demethylating agents targeting these loci could synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by reversing TME immunosuppression [14,36].
Our multidimensional analysis framework thus reveals potential biological mechanisms in HCC immunopathogenesis and highlights candidate molecular targets for developing precision immunotherapies, pending further functional validation.
Our validation pipeline confirmed three genes as central hubs connecting HCC epigenetics to immune regulation.
S100A12in the Innate Immune Microenvironment: TheS100A12-RAGE signaling axis emerged as a key regulator of monocyte homeostasis, with cg07370087 hypermethylation demonstrating a negative correlation with peripheral monocyte counts in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
Beyond its established role in driving proinflammatory cytokine release and oxidative stress through RAGE-dependent NF-κB activation [37], our findings suggest this axis may contribute to microenvironmental reprogramming in HCC.
Notably, elevatedS100A12levels reported in colorectal cancer tissues and serum [38] imply conserved roles in gastrointestinal malignancies, warranting mechanistic studies to delineate its tumor-specific regulatory networks.
BTN3A2as a Key Regulator of Adaptive Immunity: TheBTN3A2locus (cg08548066) emerged as a pivotal regulator of white blood cell composition, demonstrating significant association with neutrophil count reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Located within the MHC class I genomic region on chromosome 6p22.1 [39], this butyrophilin family member exhibits dual functionality in immune regulation and tumor progression.
Mechanistically,BTN3A2hypomethylation facilitates three-dimensional chromatin interactions with TNFRSF9 (4-1BB), a T cell costimulatory molecule critical for antitumor immunity [40].
These findings positionBTN3A2methylation as a pan-cancer biomarker with therapeutic potential through T cell modulation.
TRIM27as an Epigenetic-Metabolic checkpoint: Our study established a significant association between cg01947943 (TRIM27) hypermethylation and elevated eosinophil counts, positioningTRIM27as an epigenetic-metabolic checkpoint that orchestrates white blood cell recruitment through STAT3-mediated arginase-1 induction [41].
While in hepatocellular carcinoma it enhances invasiveness through STAT3 activation and modulates polyamine metabolism [42,43].
The metabolic reprogramming mediated by TRIM27 extends to immune modulation: STAT3 inhibition synergizes with PD-1 blockade by inducing immunogenic cell death and remodelling the tumor immune microenvironment, enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and CD8 + T cell infiltration in HCC [44].
These findings collectively validateTRIM27as a multi-mechanistic therapeutic target, with dual capacity to modulate tumor-intrinsic signaling pathways and reshape the immune microenvironment through metabolic-epigenetic crosstalk.
Our initial MR screen identified other promising candidates whose full mechanistic pathway requires further elucidation.
ForMDM1, methylation at cg14588682 exhibited neutrophil-specific regulatory effects, potentially mediated through centriolar amplification-dependent IL-8 secretion [45].
Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of HCC-infiltrating neutrophils (GSE149614) [46] revealed coordinated expression ofMDM1with CXCR2.
However, we did not observe a significant link between its methylation at cg14588682 and its expression in the TCGA-LIHC cohort, thus the epigenetic regulation of this pathway within HCC remains to be confirmed.
Similarly,ARPC1Bshowed a strong association with lymphocyte counts in our TWAS analysis.
As a key subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, ARPC1B is essential for the actin remodeling required for leukocyte trafficking and immunological synapse formation [47].
Its overexpression is linked to immune infiltration and poor prognosis across multiple cancers [48].
Although the direct epigenetic-to-expression link was not validated in our cohort, these findings positionARPC1Bas an intriguing candidate for future studies on the epigenetic control of immune cell function.
The integration of methylation-immune subtyping reveals stratified therapeutic approaches for HCC.
Tumors characterized by elevatedS100A12expression demonstrate heightened neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression, suggesting therapeutic synergy between CXCR2 inhibitors targeting the neutrophil chemotaxis axis and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to reverse epigenetic silencing.
Conversely, lesions with diminishedBTN3A2expression exhibit impaired antigen presentation capacity, rendering them susceptible to PD-1/4-1BB bispecific antibodies that simultaneously block inhibitory checkpoints while activating costimulatory pathways.
Notably,TRIM27-overexpressing tumors display STAT3-mediated metabolic reprogramming, proposing a rational combination strategy of STAT3-PD-1 dual blockade to counteract both immune evasion and Warburg effect adaptation [49,50].
From an evolutionary perspective, methylation-mediated immune editing emerges as a critical driver of HCC clonal evolution [51].
Our analyses suggest epigenetic regulation may synergize with metabolic adaptations, as evidenced by coordinated expression patterns between immune-related methylation loci and glutaminolysis-associated genes.
This observation aligns with contemporary cancer evolution models emphasizing metabolic-epigenetic coadaptation [52,53], where epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring mutually reinforce clonal fitness under immune pressure.
The identification of these evolutionarily conserved pathways provides a framework for developing interception strategies targeting adaptive mechanisms in treatment-resistant clones.
This evolutionary framework not only explains observed patterns of immune escape but also informs the design of adaptive therapy regimens that anticipate and counteract clonal adaptation trajectories.
This study has several strengths, including its systematic MR framework, the integration of multi-ancestry GWAS, and the use of Bayesian colocalization to strengthen causal inference.
However, some limitations must be acknowledged.
A primary consideration was our use of GWAS data from general populations.
While necessary for statistical power, we recognized that genetic effect sizes might differ in cancer patients.
To address this, we performed a dedicated validation analysis in the TCGA-LIHC cohort, which provided strong, HCC-specific biological evidence supporting the link between tumor methylation, gene expression, and immune infiltration (Fig.2).
Furthermore, to move beyond statistical association and provide orthogonal support for our findings, we conducted comprehensive functional enrichment and TWAS analyses.
The enrichment results confirmed that the identified genes are central to immune function (Fig.4), while the TWAS provided independent, gene-level validation for our key candidates likeBTN3A2andTRIM27(Table1).
These additional layers of evidence substantially strengthen our conclusions.
Other limitations include the potential for residual horizontal pleiotropy despite sensitivity checks, and the cross-sectional nature of the TCGA data, which does not capture temporal dynamics.
Future research using single-cell multi-omics and longitudinal patient samples is needed to further dissect these complex epigenetic-immune interactions.
Our study revealed HCC-related DNA methylation sites causally linked to white blood cell counts, mediated through robustly validated genesS100A12,TRIM27, andBTN3A2.These epigenetic-immunoregulatory hubs highlight potential therapeutic targets for reversing HCC-related immune dysfunction, advancing precision immunotherapy strategies by integrating tumor-intrinsic methylation with systemic immune remodelling.
