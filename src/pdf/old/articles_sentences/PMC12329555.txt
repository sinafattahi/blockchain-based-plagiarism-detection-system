This document presents a comprehensive update to the Polish national recommendations on metabolic and bariatric surgery, developed by a panel of experts based on the latest clinical and scientific evidence.
In light of a nearly 500% increase in the number of bariatric procedures in Poland since 2014 and significant technological advancements, it became necessary to revise national guidelines in line with international standards set by the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.
A pivotal development in Poland was the implementation of the Comprehensive Specialist Care in Bariatrics (KOS‑BAR) program in 2021, which ensured more accessible and safer care for patients with severe obesity through a structured and multidisciplinary approach.
The consensus covers the full scope of care: from the epidemiology of obesity, surgical eligibility criteria, and preoperative preparation, to the choice of surgical technique, postoperative care, management of complications, and revisional procedures.
The document also includes guidance on pharmacological treatment as an addition or alternative to surgery, and addresses the needs of specific patient groups, such as pediatric patients, elderly individuals, women of reproductive age, and those with comorbid conditions.
The aim of this update is to provide Polish patients with access to safe, effective, and evidence‑based treatment for obesity, while also aligning the health care system with the growing public health challenge posed by the obesity epidemic.
Obesity prevalence is rising both in developed and developing countries, reaching epidemic proportions.
Over the past 30 years, the number of people with obesity has tripled worldwide.
In the literature, the term globesity has emerged to vividly illustrate the scale of the problem.
Obesity is no longer a condition solely associated with developed and wealthy countries.
The in‑ crease has been observed in all countries glob‑ ally.
Currently, the problem affects all socioeconomic groups.
In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized obesity as the most serious chronic health problem of the modern world.
According to 2022 data, 1 in 8 people worldwide has obesity.
Among adults, the problem of overweight affects 43% of the global population (up from 39% in 2014), while 16% suffer from obesity (up from 13% in 2014).
The highest percentage of individuals with obesity is found in the United States, where, according to the 2015 World Obesity Federation report, more than 60% of adults are over‑ weight, and more than half of those have obesity.
Based on the “2015 Health at a Glance” re‑ port by the Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development, the rate of obesity is growing fastest in populations with lower levels of education, particularly among women.
According to Eurostat data from 2019, nearly 53% of the European population are overweight.
The problem of overweight and obesity affects different regions of Europe to varying degrees, across various social groups, and among both men and women, yet the number of obese individuals is steadily increasing in all European countries.
Confirming the presence of obesity‑related complications in the preoperative period is crucial for patient qualification for MBS, selection of the surgical method, and assessment of the safety of the proposed surgical treatment.
It is estimated that the overall number of obesity‑related complications may include around 200 different pathologies.
The causes of the onset of most of these complications are complex, but obesity plays a crucial role in their development, as evidenced by their remission or an improvement in their course with weight reduction.
Among patients qualifying for MBS, these complications are present in almost all individuals.
The absence of such complications typically indicates an incomplete examination, rather than reflecting an actual health status of the patient or the extent of obesity.
Most commonly, these complications manifest as multidisease syndromes, where obesity leads to the development of, for example, hypertension, T2D, and joint degeneration.
Obesity significantly shortens the life expectancy of patients.
It has been shown that for individuals with a BMI ranging from 40 to 45 kg/m2, the expected lifespan is 8 to 10 years shorter than for those with a BMI between 22.5 and 25 kg/m2.
This reduction in life expectancy is comparable to the effect of smoking.
The statistics related to causes of death associated with obesity may be distorted.
In the case of most patients who die from obesity‑related complications (eg, T2D, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and many others), the underlying cause of these conditions—obesity—is of‑ ten not listed as the primary cause of death; instead, other diseases that are complications of obesity are typically considered.
When analyzing the impact of severe obesity on health and lifespan, it should not be forgotten that all the aforementioned complications significantly contribute to the reduced quality of life for individuals with obesity.
Often, the disease is so debilitating that it renders patients completely disabled long before death.
Currently, the treatment of obesity is primarily palliative, focusing on managing the com‑ plications of the disease rather than addressing its root causes.
This approach to obesity and its consequences leads to ineffective management of financial resources allocated to health care.
This issue becomes especially significant in MBS, given numerous scientific studies pointing to the high cost‑effectiveness of this treatment method for obese patients.
In light of the rapid increase in the number of patients with obesity, it is crucial to effective‑ ly manage financial resources, accounting for obesity treatment as the basis for handling its complications.
Conservative treatment of obesity (diet, exercise, and other lifestyle interventions), particularly in the case of severe obesity, is characterized by low effectiveness and a lack of lasting results.
In many cases, after an attempt at conservative treatment, obesity recurs, often exceeding the initial levels, leading to disease progression.
Despite the introduction of more effective drugs in the pharmacotherapy of severe obesity, bar‑ iatric surgery remains the most effective meth‑ od of treatment.
Surgery has ceased to be merely a treatment for excessive body weight.
The more significant effects are the metabolic results of the procedure, which lead to the resolution of obesity‑related complications.
This is confirmed by numerous studies documenting the superiority of surgical treatment of obesity over conservative methods, not only in terms of weight re‑ duction but also with respect to the resolution of diseases caused by obesity, such as diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, fatty liver disease, and the reduction of certain malignancy incidences.
It has been proven that surgical treatment of patients with obesity extends their life and significantly improves its quality.
Considering the benefits of surgical treatment for severe obesity and its complications, it should be regarded as the treatment of choice for the patients who meet the qualification criteria.11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.
The qualification criteria for surgical treatment of severe obesity are based on the assessment of BMI, defined as a patient’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters.
Surgical treatment of obesity may also be considered in patients with a BMI of 30–34.9 kg/m2 and T2D, if hyperglycemia persists despite the use of oral medications and insulin.
Situations where obesity renders a patient in‑ eligible for an essential surgical procedure in an‑ other medical specialty (eg, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, hernia surgery, organ transplant).
In such cases, MBS serves as a bridging therapy and should be considered to induce significant weight loss, thereby reducing the risk of the originally planned procedure.
Patients who have previously undergone bariatric surgery but have not achieved the desired therapeutic effect (either in terms of weight reduction or resolution of obesity‑related diseases) should be offered revisional surgery.
The BMI criterion refers to the highest reported value in the past.
Preoperative weight reduction that lowers BMI below the abovementioned thresholds is not a contraindication to surgical treatment.
A lack of confirmed weight loss attempts through conservative methods before an elective surgical treatment does not constitute a contraindication to surgery in adults.
Orthopedic procedures: patients with a BMI over 40 kg/m2 undergoing total hip or knee re‑ placement surgeries face an increased risk of com‑ plications, such as rehospitalization, surgical site infections, and deep vein thrombosis.
MBS per‑ formed within 2 years before joint replacement significantly reduces the risk of these periopera‑ tive complications.
Hernia surgery: obesity increases the risk of abdominal hernias and complications, such as infections, impaired wound healing, and recurrence after hernia repair.
Patients with large abdominal wall hernias may benefit from a 2‑stage treatment: bariatric surgery as the first stage, followed by hernia repair, which can lower the risk of complications and recurrence.
Transplantation: obesity may limit patient eligibility for organ transplant, serve as a relative contraindication, and pose significant intraoperative technical challenges.
MBS as a bridging therapy can significantly improve transplant eligibility for patients with kidney or liver failure.
Additionally, weight loss following MBS can increase eligibility for heart transplant.
In some cases, bar‑ iatric surgery–induced weight loss can improve left ventricular ejection fraction, potentially re‑ ducing the need for transplant.21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36.
Bariatric surgery is recommended for patients aged 18 to 65 years.
MBS is not contraindicated in individuals over 65 years of age, and there is currently no upper age limit for obesity surgery.
Recent studies indicate that these procedures may be associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications, especially early complications, as compared with procedures performed in younger populations— this is due to multimorbidity rather than age itself.
However, MBS still provides significant benefits, including excess weight loss and remission or alleviation of obesity‑related diseases.37MBS in patients over 65 years of age may not necessarily extend life expectancy, but it significantly improves quality of life.
When qualifying elderly patients for bariatric surgery, chronological age should not be the primary factor.
Instead, physiological changes associated with aging, such as frailty, cognitive abilities, obesity‑related diseases, and cardiopulmonary fitness should be considered, as they influence postoperative outcomes and complication risks.
Additionally, it is essential to recognize that the likelihood of remission or improvement in obesity‑related diseases decreases with time.
There‑ fore, especially in this age group, patients should be qualified for surgery as soon as possible after necessary dietary and psychological preparation and optimization of chronic disease management.38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47.
Weight loss before surgery, or at least no weight gain during the preparation period, is recommend‑ ed.
Maintaining or reducing body weight confirms the patient’s motivation for treatment and willingness to change previous habits.
Assessing the patient’s motivation level and ability to cooperate during the perioperative period, as well as in long‑term follow‑up.56,57,58.
Patient qualification and preparation for bariatric surgery should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team consisting of specialists from various fields.
The objective of the team is to prepare a patient for surgery and oversee appropriate and complication‑free weight loss both in the early and long‑term postoperative periods.
A key role in the multidisciplinary team is played by the coordinator, who supervises the preparation process and the entire treatment course.
This should be a physician experienced in treating and caring for patients with severe obesity, preferably a bariatric surgeon.
All patients qualifying for surgical obesity treatment should be assessed for the severity of obesity‑related diseases and other comorbidities, particularly those affecting surgical eligibility.
A proper evaluation should include medical history taking, physical examination, psycho‑ social assessment, laboratory and imaging tests, and perioperative risk assessment.
The results should be recorded in medical documentation.
Polysomnography (screening for obstructive sleep apnea in the case of a positive STOP‑BANG questionnaire result).
Depending on the spectrum of comorbid conditions and results of the preoperative assessment, the extent of diagnostic tests may need to be expanded.59,60,61,62,63.
The best treatment outcomes are achieved when the preoperative preparation period lasts at least 3 months.
The optimal period is consid‑ ered to be 6–12 months.
During this time, at least 3 appointments with the bariatric care coordinator or other multidisciplinary team members are recommended.
If the left lobe of the liver is significantly en‑ larged due to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis, a diet aimed at reducing liver volume should be introduced preoperatively.
Due to an increased risk of peri‑ and postoperative complications, smoking cessation at least 6 weeks before surgery is recommended.
In patients with a history of alcohol dependence, a documented abstinence period of at least 12 months is required.
The risk of relapse post–bariatric surgery should be considered.
In this age group, in addition to the previously mentioned recommendations, preoperative assessment should also include an evaluation of the patient’s psychological maturity in terms of their ability to provide informed consent, willingness to undergo treatment, adherence to postoperative recommendations, and awareness of the limitations and consequences of surgery.
At every stage of surgical preparation of patients under 18 years of age, family involvement is obligatory.
It is crucial to obtain family members’ acceptance and confirm their willingness to support surgical treatment, ensuring they understand the consequences of surgery and provide postoperative support.
Informed consent for surgery must be signed by both the child and their legal guardian.
Patient and family education should cover the types of MBS, as well as potential short‑ and long‑term complications.
Systematic scientific research has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of weight reduction and improved control of obesity‑related diseases in patients undergoing surgical treatment for severe obesity.
Based on current knowledge, the previous classification of procedures into restrictive and malabsorptive surgeries appears to be outdated.
Today, MBS is recognized not only for its weight loss effects (bariatric effect) but also for its capacity for improving obesity‑related conditions, particularly T2D (metabolic effect).
Modern research demonstrates that these effects are inter‑ woven, and the impact of different surgical procedures on the body is far more complex than initially assumed.
Therefore, classifying procedures solely based on these 2 categories does not fully capture the complexity of their mechanisms.
A variety of bariatric procedures are currently applied, each associated with different levels of difficulty, expected outcomes, and potential com‑ plications.
New methods and modifications of existing procedures continue to emerge, requiring comparative studies and medium‑ to long‑term outcome evaluations before being recognized as safe, effective, and recommended by scientific and ethical committees.
biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD‑DS).
According to a 2024 report on global trends in MBS for the years 2020–2021, SG and RYGB remain the most commonly performed bariatric and metabolic procedures worldwide.
These surgeries offer the most favorable risk‑benefit ratio, as demonstrated by numerous long‑term follow‑up studies.
In recent years, OAGB has also gained recognition as a standard metabolic procedure and is now the third most commonly performed bariatric surgery globally.
Another increasingly popular procedure is SADI‑S, which, according to IFSO and ASMBS, is a fully recognized MBS.
SADI‑S is a modified version of BPD‑DS.
is not classified as experimental or innovative surgery.
Adjustable gastric banding (AGB), once a widely used method, is now considered historical and is no longer recommended.
Approximately 20% of patients require band removal due to complications or insufficient bariatric effects.
There are currently no uniform guidelines for selecting a specific bariatric procedure for an individual patient.
Different bariatric procedures vary in their mechanisms, expected bariatric and metabolic effects, potential complications, and long‑term care requirements.
The choice of the optimal surgical method for each patient should be individualized and consider the primary treatment goal (bariatric vs metabolic effect).
Patient’s ability to adhere to perioperative and long‑term follow‑up care.
SADI‑S as a second‑stage procedure for patients with BMI >50 kg/m2 who did not achieve sufficient weight loss after previous SG.
A multidisciplinary team plays a crucial role in preparing patients for surgery by reducing modifiable perioperative risk factors.
The final decision regarding surgical qualification, procedure selection, and patient readiness rests with the surgeon.
It is recommended that bariatric procedures be performed in centers with experience in MBS, by skilled staff, and with necessary equipment.
For all types of surgical procedures, the surgeon’s and the team’s the level of experience appears to be crucial.
The bariatric center should have the capacity to manage complications of bariatric surgeries, both in terms of the team’s skills and the availability of appropriate equipment.
The preferred approach for bariatric procedures is laparoscopy, which is associated with a lower complication rate and reduced perioperative mortality.
If technical difficulties preclude performing the procedure laparoscopically or if it cannot be safely continued, it is advised to refrain from performing the surgery.
Conversion to open surgery is not recommended.
Addition‑ ally, in the treatment of complications, the preferred method should be minimally invasive, with conversion reserved for exceptional situations.
If a patient would benefit most from a procedure not available at the current center, they should be referred to a referral center that can offer the optimal form of treatment.
According to available scientific data, the use of a structured perioperative management proto‑ col contributes to improved short‑ and long‑term treatment outcomes.
Every patient qualified for bariatric surgery should undergo GFS.
For patients undergoing SG and OAGB, GFS should be performed 12 months after surgery, and every 3–5 years thereafter.
For other cases, GFS should be performed in the presence of clinical symptoms.
Gastric balloons have been used for obesity treatment for over 30 years.
Currently, the European market offers implants registered for 6 and 12 months of therapy.
Depending on the type of balloon and its inflation level, the expected therapeutic effect at the end of the treatment is 10% to 15% of total body weight loss (TWL).
The com plication risk reported in most meta‑analyses does not exceed 2%.
However, it should be noted that in the event of gastrointestinal obstruction or gastric perforation, these complications can be severe and lead to patient death.
A rare complication associated with gastric balloon therapy is acute pancreatitis.
In the case of confirmed acute pancreatitis, urgent balloon removal is advised.
Most patients report nausea / vomiting and other dyspeptic symptoms during the early stages of therapy, which, in extreme cases, may require early removal of the implant.
The balloon removal procedure should be performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation due to a risk of aspiration of food contents into the airways.
A major issue in treating obesity with a gastric balloon is the recurrence of the condition after balloon removal.
It should be emphasized that the support of a multidisciplinary team is necessary for achieving satisfactory treatment results.
According to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines, performing gastric balloon implantation procedures independently should be preceded by 10 procedures conducted under the super‑ vision of an expert.
This endoscopic procedure involves reducing the stomach volume by performing plication of its wall with sutures encompassing the full thick‑ ness of the wall in the stomach body region, from the angle to the upper part of the body, without performing fundoplasty.
This reduces the organ’s volume by about 70%.
In addition to the restrictive effect, another benefit of endoscopic gastroplasty (ESG) is the 2–3 times slower passage through the stomach, which results in prolonged satiety.
Results from numerous studies indicate a high efficacy of this method in treating obesity and its complications.
Reported efficacy in terms of reducing TWL is around 16%–18%.
In the multicenter, prospective MERIT study, the beneficial effect of ESG on the treatment of hypertension and T2D was demonstrated.
Unlike the gastric balloon, gastric plication is designed to provide permanent volume reduction.
Avail‑ able data indicate stable weight loss in 5‑year follow‑up.
The risk of complications after ESG is low, around 1%–2%.
The most common com‑ plication is gastrointestinal bleeding.
Less frequent complications include gastric perforation, inflammatory infiltration / perigastric fluid collection, and pneumothorax.
In the case of an ESG failure, MBS may be per‑ formed.
There is no increased complication rate in this patient group.
Due to a potential risk of interaction between the stapler and sutures used during ESG, it is recommended to remove the sutures before performing the surgical procedure.
Patients with grade III obesity who are not suitable candidates for surgical treatment or re‑ fuse such treatment.
Current studies are focused on combined methods for treating obesity, including induction pharmacological therapy with glucagon‑like peptide 1 (GLP‑1) analogs and the ESG procedure.
While there is no standardization of this treatment approach, preliminary results are encouraging.
Endoscopic procedures are the standard in the diagnosis and treatment of MBS complications.
Effective endoscopic treatment is possible with a significant experience in postoperative upper gastrointestinal tract anatomy, fluorosco‑ py‑guided procedures, and proficiency in a wide range of endoscopic techniques.
Treatment should be performed in close cooperation with the surgical team, with the option to combine classic surgical methods (re‑laparoscopy / drain‑ age).
Recommendations for endoscopic treatment of the most common MBS complications are discussed below.
In the case of small fistulas, with a diameter up to 1 cm, endoscopic methods may be effective.
The most common methods are over‑the‑scope (OTS) clips and endoscopic suturing.
However, their effectiveness in chronic fistulas with a wider tract is limited.
In the cases of failure, the treatment of choice is surgical revision.
A leak in the staple line after SG is a serious complication, occurring in up to 5% of all SG procedures.
Leaks are classified as early, within 7 days of surgery, and late, after 7 days.
The most frequent location of a leak is the upper part of the staple line, near the gastroesophageal junction.
Endoscopic treatment of leaks involves the use of self‑expanding stents, internal endoscopic drainage, and vacuum therapy.
For late leaks, techniques that involve closing fistulas using OTS clips and endoscopic suturing kits may also be applicable.
Self‑expanding stents are widely used in the treatment of leaks, including fully covered stents designed for bar‑ iatric patients.
The average duration of therapy is 6–8 weeks.
The treatment success rate is estimated at around 75%.
Stent placement is often preceded by re‑laparoscopy and abscess drainage near the leak site.
The most common complication after stent placement is migration, occur‑ ring in approximately 15% of cases.
In the case of stent migration, repositioning under endoscopic control is necessary, and if stent migrates into the jejunum, surgical treatment is required.
To prevent migration, attempts are made to fix the stent using clips and sutures placed endoscopically, but there is no evidence supporting their routine use.
In the case of concomitant stenosis at the gastric angle, appropriate treatment is necessary (most often balloon dilatation to 30 mm).
A second effective method for treating leaks after SG is endoscopic vacuum therapy using exchangeable sponges.
The vacuum therapy set is applied to the leak site and connected to a continuous suction system with a pressure of 75–120 mm Hg.
The sponge needs to be replaced every 2–3 days.
The treatment duration is generally shorter than with self‑expanding stents (approximately 3 weeks), with a success rate of around 90%.90,91,92,93.
Metabolic and bariatric treatment does not end when the patient is discharged from the hospital.
Patients require regular follow‑up as part of ongoing care provided by specialists familiar with the issues faced by individuals after MBS.
The goal of continuous monitoring and long‑term care for patients after bariatric surgery is not only to improve outcomes in terms of weight loss but also to prevent long‑term com‑ plications and deficiencies.
During subsequent stages of follow‑up, continuous patient education regarding proper nutrition is necessary.
There are no complications that would require rehospitalization.
Ursodeoxycholic acid 50–600 mg daily for 6 months.
Diet rich in simple sugars and fats (eg, sweets, sugary sodas) should be avoided; this also helps prevent dumping syndrome;In the first 6–8 weeks, oral medications should, if possible, be taken in crushed or liquid form; the pharmacokinetics of medications in bariat‑ ric patients may change, affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, and / or elimination.
There is insufficient data to make general dos‑ ing recommendations, so individual risk assess‑ ment is necessary.
In the first 6–8 weeks, oral medications should, if possible, be taken in crushed or liquid form; the pharmacokinetics of medications in bariatric patients may change, affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, and / or elimination.
There is insufficient data to make general dosing recommendations, so individual risk assessment is necessary.
Regular physical activity has proven benefits after MBS.
Long‑term follow‑up for bariatric surgery patients should be managed by a specialist multidisciplinary team.
The follow‑up program is coordinated by a program coordinator, such as a specialist nurse or, in certain cases, a surgeon or internal medicine specialist (eg, endocrinologist).
Depending on patient needs, access to specialists involved in the preoperative qualification process for surgeries related to comorbid conditions should be provided, including dietitians, psychologists, and bariatric surgeons.
Multidisciplinary follow‑up after MBS is essential for achieving optimal, long‑term treatment outcomes and ensuring patient safety.
Each bariatric center should develop its own long‑term follow‑up system based on experience and avail‑ able resources.
The frequency of follow‑up vis‑ its depends on the type of surgery, the rate of weight loss, and potential health problems after the procedure.
From the perspective of long‑term treatment outomes, the most important follow‑up visits are those scheduled during the first year postsurgery.
Between 4 and 6 visits are recommended during this period, including medical consultations, as well as dietary and psychological counseling.
Follow‑up at the bariatric center can be carried out by an internist.
Two years after surgery, ongoing care should be provided by primary health care services.
If complications requiring surgical treatment are suspected, a consultation with a bariatric surgeon is recommended.
Numerous studies have shown a significant and positive impact of participation in support groups and associations for patients undergoing MBS, both pre‑ and postoperatively.
Participation in these groups leads to increased knowledge and awareness about treatment, which can determine proper preparation for surgery and contribute to better postoperative outcomes, including weight loss, remission of obesity‑related diseases, quality of life improvements, fewer complications, and quicker recovery.
Many patients are aware of the existence and activities of support groups and associations, and participate actively in them even before deciding to undergo surgery.
However, there is also a significant number of patients who are not familiar with these resources.
Given the positive impact of patient involvement in support groups on treatment outcomes, it is recommended that all bar‑ iatric surgery patients be encouraged to maintain regular contact with such institutions, which of‑ ten operate in conjunction with surgical centers and are widely active on social media.
Long‑term complications that impair the patient’s daily functioning.
A new terminology has been proposed, recommending the use of the terms recurrence of excess body weight and lack of surgical response to describe failure of MBS so as to avoid attributing the failure solely to the patient.
It is important to distinguish between these 2 conditions as separate entities.
The most common indications for revisional surgery are weight regain and recurrence of comorbidities, which comprise two‑thirds of all cases.
a biological or genetic predisposition that leads to early resistance to treatment.
Reversal—restoring the original anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract after the primary procedure due to poor tolerance or an unresolved complication.
Corrective procedures are usually planned to optimize the effectiveness of previous surgeries, while conversion procedures often introduce additional therapeutic mechanisms.
When qualifying a patient for revisional surgery, consideration should be given to the possibility of performing minimally invasive procedures, including endoscopic approaches.
When considering surgical conversion as a revisional procedure, alongside the direct reasons for qualification, clinical indications for the primary metabolic procedure and the surgeon’s skillset should also be taken into account.
It is unclear which revisional procedure is optimal.
In all cases, qualification for surgical treatment shouldbe based on an individual case analysis and involve a multidisciplinary team (bariatric team).
AGB—dysfunction of the band or distant com‑ plications related to its presence (erosions, migrations) require removal of the device and conversion, usually to SG or RYGB.
VBG—recurrence of obesity or dysfunction of the band usually requires conversion to RYGB or SG.
SG—in the case of GERD or functional problems related to the sleeve (ie, stenosis, vomiting), con‑ version to RYGB is preferred.
If the primary indication is weight recurrence or a lack of response without functional issues, options include RYGB, OAGB, BPD‑DS, or SADI‑S.
RYGB—the presence of a gastro‑gastrostomy fistula, pouch dilation (>6 cm in length or >5 cm in width), or excessively wide gastrojejunostomy (>2 cm) as a cause of weight recurrence should be corrected by reconstructing the pouch (also endoscopically) or re‑establishing the anastomosis.
Another option for correction is distalization of the intestinal anastomosis to reduce the overall length of the common limb.
OAGB—in the case of GERD, conversion to RYGB is preferred.
If the primary indication is weight recurrence or a lack of response with‑ out functional problems, options include RYGB, SADI‑S, or SG.
Literature data indicate that revisional surgeries, as compared with primary surgeries, show lower effectiveness in both weight reduction and the resolution of comorbidities.
They are also associated with a significantly higher perioperative risk.
Tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg)—a long‑acting agonist of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and GLP‑1 receptors.
Research results have shown that their use leads to weight loss averaging from 6% to 23% of total body weight, depending on the medication used.
Long‑term observations (as of now for one of the medications) have also shown a beneficial effect of pharmacological treatment of obesity on reducing the frequency of major cardio‑ vascular events.
Given the above and the fact that pharmaco‑ logical treatment of obesity carries a lower risk than surgical treatment, it is recommended that patients be informed about the possibility of using pharmacological treatment as the first line of therapy before being qualified for MBS.
Pharmacological treatment, similarly to surgical treatment, should include nutritional education, psychological support, and physical rehabilitation.
Patients should also be informed that pharmaco‑logical treatment is chronic (permanent), as otherwise weight regain will occur.
In the cases where pharmacological treatment is ineffective (weight loss below 5% after 3 months of medication use), switching the medication is recommended.
If further ineffectiveness occurs, surgical treatment should be considered.
Given that preoperative weight loss is one of the key elements for perioperative safety, as it reduces the incidence of early postoperative complications, pharmaco‑ logical treatment of obesity should be considered for patients who do not achieve the desired weight loss through nonpharmacological methods (neo‑ adjuvant treatment).
In the case of obesity recurrence or insufficient weight loss after MBS, and excluding surgical causes of the situation, pharmacological treatment should be recommended before considering revision surgery.
In certain circumstances, any diagnostic and therapeutic decisions regarding obesity treatment should be made individually, based on the conciliar decisions of an appropriately expanded therapeutic team and the patient’s specific needs.
In women of reproductive age (up to 50 years) with an intact uterus, who undergo bariatric treatment, contraception should be started preoperatively and continued for 12–18 months after surgery.
A gynecological consultation before surgery regarding the choice of the contraception method is advised, as preoperative counseling has been proven to increase the likelihood of proper use of contraception postoperatively.
Due to possible absorption disturbances of both estrogenic and progestogenic components in oral contraceptives, especially after RYGB, intrauterine devices and subcutaneous implants releasing progestogens, or possibly barrier methods, are recommended.
Due to a higher frequency of menstrual disturbances in women with obesity and the inability to unequivocally assess the phase of the cycle, it is recommended to measure β‑human chorionic gonadotropin levels before surgery in all women of reproductive age with an intact uterus.
Pregnancy is contraindicated during the rapid weight loss phase after surgery due to an increased risk of miscarriage, hypoglycemia, nutrient deficiencies, malnutrition of the fetus, and consequently intrauterine growth restriction.
The minimum period between surgery and attempts to conceive is considered 12 months, until weight stabilization, ideally 12–18 months, due to possible vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies.
Earlier conception can be individually considered in the cases of advanced maternal age or reduced ovarian reserve.
Due to a higher risk of nutritional deficiencies after RYGB than after SG, and consequently a greater risk of intrauterine growth restriction of the fetus, SG appears to be a safer treatment option for women of reproductive age, but literature data on this topic are limited.
MBS leads to a significant reduction in the risk of gestational diabetes, pregnancy‑induced hypertension, preterm birth, and the birth of a new‑ born with high birth weight.
At the same time, it increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, nutritional deficiencies, and deficiency anemia in the pregnant woman.
Every pregnancy in a patient who has undergone MBS should be treated as high‑risk and managed by an obstetrician‑gynecologist experienced in the treatment of patients after MBS.
The delivery should ideally take place in a center with a referral level greater than level I. Continuous vita‑ min and micronutrient supplementation is necessary, and regular monitoring of at least peripheral blood count, ferritin concentration, and vita‑ min B12 levels is required.
The standard gestational diabetes diagnostic test, the 75‑g oral glucose tolerance test, should not be used in patients after bariatric surgery due to a risk of late postprandial syndrome and hypoglycemia, which may cause fetal distress.
The recommended alternative diagnostic method for gestational diabetes is a weekly evaluation of fasting blood glucose levels and levels after main meals, or a continuous 7‑day transdermal glucose monitoring.
This should be conducted twice, around the eighth–tenth week of pregnancy, and again between weeks 24 and 28.
The evaluation may be complemented by the measurement of HbA1clevels.
There are no absolute contraindications for qualifying patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for bariatric treatment, and the results in this group of patients are comparable with those observed in individuals with‑ out IBD.
A close collaboration between the bariatric team and a gastroenterologist is crucial when qualifying IBD patients for MBS.
Factors that need to be considered during qualification include disease activity, medication use, nutritional status, and the potential impact of obesity treatment on IBD symptoms, as some studies suggested a correlation between MBS and the development IBD.
Specific dietary needs and specialized gastroenterological care for such patients should also be considered.
The obesity treatment scheme for patients with IBD should be similar to that followed in the case of patients without IBD, starting with behavioral interventions, through the introduction of antiobesity medications, and ending with MBS.
The choice of a surgical treatment method for patients with IBD is not straightforward, although there are reports suggesting a higher incidence of complications after RYGB in patients diagnosed with IBD.
Up to 10% of patients with celiac disease may present symptoms of pathological obesity.
There are no absolute contraindications to qualifying patients with diagnosed celiac disease for bariatric treatment, although there is no clear scientific evidence regarding the impact of bariatric surgery on clinical treatment outcomes.
Close collaboration between the bariatric team and a gastroenterologist is crucial.
Obesity is one of the major risk factors for the development of malignancy, including esophageal, breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers.
Numerous scientific studies indicate that MBS can contribute to a reduction in the risk of developing these cancers.
Given the increasing number of cancer patients and the rising proportion of individuals eligible for bariatric treatment, clinical decisions regarding qualification for surgery in this group of patients are expected to be made more frequently.
It has been previously assumed that a specific amount of time must pass between the completion of oncological treatment and MBS.
However, it is now suggested that each patient previously treated for cancer be qualified individually, based on the decision of the clinical oncologist.
