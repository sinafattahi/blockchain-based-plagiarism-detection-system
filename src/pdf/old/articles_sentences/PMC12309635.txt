Osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 700,000 individuals in NSW, with projections estimating an increase to 1 million by 2030.
This has led to a significant rise in joint replacement surgeries and associated healthcare costs.
Despite guidelines recommending non‐surgical care as first line treatment, many patients remain on surgical waiting lists without accessing these treatments.
The aims of this study were to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes of people with hip and knee OA attending two Sydney Local Health District (SLHD) Osteoarthritis Chronic Care Program (OACCP) clinics, and to identify whether baseline measures are associated with achieving Minimal Clinically Important (MCI) difference in outcomes.
This retrospective study (n= 1402) evaluated the OACCP's implementation within two SLHD hospitals between Oct 2018 and Sept 2023, describing patient characteristics, patient reported outcomes, physical performance measures, and allied health access.
Changes in clinical outcomes in the short‐term (3 months) and long‐term (12 months) assessment as well as associations of patient's baseline measures with MCI improvements in clinical outcomes were analysed.
Most self‐reported outcomes and physical performance measures improved at both 3 and 12 months.
38.6% of patients reached the MCI threshold for KOOS total score at 3 months, which rose to 52.1% at 12 months.
None of the baseline characteristics predicted outcomes.
Following multidisciplinary non‐surgical care, people with hip and/or knee OA experience improved quality of life and function that is sustained for up to 12 months.
However, analysis was limited by low long‐term follow‐up rates and no control group.
It is estimated that over 700,000 of the 8.2 million residents of New South Wales (NSW), Australia have osteoarthritis (OA) and this is expected to rise to 1 million by 2030 due to the ageing population (NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation2019).
There has been a 50% increase in joint replacement surgery in the 10‐year period between 2005 and 2015 in Australia, contributing to over $3.75 billion annually in healthcare expenditure (NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation2019).
Concerningly, 7 in 10 people on waiting lists for joint replacement surgery have not accessed guideline‐recommended non‐surgical care (NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation2019).
A recent systematic review of 20 clinical practice guidelines (Conley et al.2023) for OA concluded that key consistent treatment recommendations for hip and knee OA were exercise, education, and advice on diet and exercise to achieve weight loss (where appropriate).
In NSW, the Osteoarthritis Chronic Care Program (OACCP) was developed by the NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation (ACI) and implemented across the NSW public health system as part of the Ministry of Health Leading Better Value Care initiative.
The OACCP Model of Care is a comprehensive multidisciplinary model incorporating clinical care standards designed to improve the care of people with hip and knee OA.
It promotes a whole person assessment, with coordination of non‐operative care, regular review, and shared decision making regarding joint replacement surgery (NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation2019).
Participants are encouraged to access OACCP dietetics, physiotherapy, medical, and where appropriate clinical psychology services.
All participants who are overweight or obese are encouraged to lose a minimum of 5% of their body weight through a combination of diet and exercise, which have been found to be clinically effective and cost‐effective treatment options (Losina et al.2019; Messier et al.2004; Shahid et al.2024).
All OACCP participants are screened for psychological distress and those found to have moderate or high levels of depression, anxiety or stress are encouraged to access clinical psychology services (NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation2012).
Participants may also choose to access clinical psychology services to assist with lifestyle behaviour change.
The OACCP clinics receive referrals from orthopaedic clinics (i.e. patients deemed not appropriate for joint replacement surgery at this time, or those on the surgical wait list) as well as from rheumatology clinics.
The delivery of the OACCP Model of Care within the Sydney Local Health District (SLHD) has not been formally evaluated.
Therefore, there are no published data regarding the characteristics of patients attending the service, and their clinical outcomes.
Describe patient characteristics, patient reported outcomes, physical performance measures and allied health access of patients attending the OACCP.
Describe the changes in clinical outcomes in the short‐term (3 months) and long‐term (12 months) assessment for self‐reported OA status: Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), Hip injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS), quality of life (PROMIS‐29), physical performance measures 40‐m fast paced walk test and Timed Up and Go (TUG) and BMI.
Identify patient characteristics (baseline HOOS/KOOS score, baseline pain scores, BMI category, age, sex) that are associated with minimal clinically important (MCI) improvements in clinical outcomes at 3 and 12 months.
We conducted a retrospective review and analysis of routinely collected data and patient medical records.
This study follows the recommendations of the Reporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement (Benchimol et al.2015).
Ethics approval was granted by the SLHD for protocol X23‐0112 and 2023/ETH00672: Evaluating outcomes of the OACCP.
This study was conducted at two public hospitals within SLHD in Sydney, NSW, Australia: The Canterbury Hospital (TCH) and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH).
Eligible participants included those who attended an initial assessment at an OACCP clinic, from 15th October 2018 to 25th September 2023.
Routinely collected data collected at OACCP clinical visits were extracted from the SLHD OACCP REDCap (Harris et al.2009) databases and the NSW Health digital platform HOPE (Health Outcomes and Patient Experience) databases.
Patient‐reported outcome measures include the KOOS (rated 0–100, where 0 represents extreme knee problems and 100 represents no knee problems) for knee OA and the HOOS (rated 0–100) for hip OA.
Both KOOS and HOOS contain five subcategories (pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living (ADL), function in sport and recreation, and knee or hip related Quality of Life (QOL)).
PROMIS‐29 (Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) scores are also collected across multiple domains: depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities are rated on a scale from 4 to 20, and global pain is rated from 0 to 10.
Physical performance measures collected by OACCP physiotherapists included the 40‐m fast paced walking test, and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test.
BMI (height and weight) was also measured.
Allied health access was extracted by manual review of a subset of electronic medical records.
This included a number of consultations with a physiotherapist, clinical psychologist, and dietician, as well as attendance at individual or group exercise sessions or hydrotherapy, over a 12‐month period from initial attendance.
Quantitative data were analysed using STATA version 16.1 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Descriptive statistics were used for patient demographics and clinical characteristics.
Categorical variables were described with frequencies (%), and continuous variables with means and standard deviations (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR).
Differences between initial assessment and the follow‐up time‐points were calculated using pairedt‐tests, with outcomes considered statistically significant if alpha was < 0.05.
The MCI in clinical outcomes was used to determine the proportion of patients who achieved an MCI improvement in each outcome in the short‐term (3 months) and long‐term (12 months) assessments.
The specific cut‐offs that are considered clinically relevant are population‐ and context‐based (Cronström et al.2023); therefore, the best available metrics for those undergoing non‐surgical treatment were used.
MCI difference in clinical outcomes were set as 10‐point increase for the overall KOOS (Torstensen et al.2023), 18‐point increase for HOOS (Hung et al.2018; Jayakumar et al.2022), a one unit improvement in global pain rating (Cronström et al.2023), 1.10 s improvement in TUG (Alghadir et al.2015), 0.1 m/s improvement for the 40m walk test (Chui et al.2012), and a minimum weight loss of 5% (Bliddal et al.2014).
Participants in the underweight or healthy weight ranges were excluded from the weight loss analysis.
Multinomial mixed‐effects logistic regression was used to investigate whether the pre‐selected individual patient characteristics were associated with achieving the MCI difference at both short‐term and long‐term time‐point assessments.
Potential variables were force entered into the model based on the literature (Holden et al.2023; Teoh et al.2017).
A total of 1402 patient medical records were analysed.
Of these, 71.6% (n= 1004) were from the RPAH, and 28.4% (n= 398) from TCH.
Median patient age was 66 years (IQR 59–74, range 30–88).
66.5% (n= 932) of patients identified as female, 33.2% (n= 466) male, 0.1% as neither, and 0.2% had missing data regarding sex.
Knee OA was the presenting reason for 86.5% of patients (n= 1213), hip OA for 12.6% (n= 176), and both knee and hip for 0.9% (n= 13).
BMI data was available for 63.2% (n= 886) of patients, with a mean BMI of 31.5 (SD 7.1).
Detailed patient characteristics for each hospital are presented in Table1.
Baseline demographic data (age, gender, BMI, joint, referral source).
The main source of referrals was from the orthopaedic clinics but the two hospitals differed in their referral criteria.
At Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the referrals were predominantly patients deemed not requiring a joint replacement or patients requesting non‐surgical treatments (n= 514, 26.2%).
In contrast, Canterbury Hospital received most referrals from the joint replacement waitlist (n= 297, 74.6%).
Baseline KOOS scores were available for 946/1213 (78.0%) of patients with knee OA, with a mean total score of 43.3 (SD 18.2).
Baseline HOOS scores were available for 146/176 (83.0%) patients with hip OA, with a mean total score of 41.7 (SD 19.6).
For both KOOS and HOOS, the lowest scoring subcategories (greater disability) were for sports and recreation, and QOL.
PROMIS‐29 raw scores included mean physical function 11.2 (SD 3.8), anxiety 10 (SD 4.5), depression 9.0 (SD 4.6), fatigue 11.8 (SD 4.3), sleep 12.2 (SD 4.0), and social 11.0 (SD 4.3) dimensions.
Pain interference was rated at mean of 13.8 (SD 4.3), and global pain was rated at a mean of 6.2 (SD 2.3).
Detailed baseline outcomes are presented in Table2.
KOOS, HOOS, PROMIS‐29, objective measures raw scores for baseline, 3 months and 12 months, and the mean difference (95% CI) from baseline at 3 months and 12 months (combined Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and Canterbury Hospital).
Note:PROMIS scores include subscales for physical function, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to perform social roles and pain interference rated on a scale from 4 to 20, global pain is rated from 0 to 10.
HOOS and KOOS Scores includes subscales for pain, symptoms, function in activities of daily living, joint‐related quality of life, and function in sports and recreation, with scores on each subscale ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).

Physical performance measures were available for 851/1402 (60.1%) of patients.
TUG took a mean of 12.2 (SD 7.6) seconds, and the mean 40‐m walk test was 1.1 m/s (SD 0.4).
Allied health access data were available for a subset of patients,n= 345/1402 (24.6%).
At both hospitals, 82.0% (n= 283/345) consulted a dietician, 42.3% (n= 146/345) consulted a clinical psychologist, and 100% (n= 345/345) consulted a physiotherapist.
At the RPAH, there were similar proportions of patients choosing to complete their exercise programme independently (n= 96/183, 52.5%) versus in supervised gym sessions (n= 87/183, 47.5%).
Patients attended a mean of 9 (SD 8) individual sessions with a physiotherapist or exercise physiologist versus a mean of 12 (SD 9) group gym sessions.
Hydrotherapy was accessed by 14.7% (n= 27/183) of patients over a mean of 18 (SD 12) sessions.
Those who consulted a dietician had a mean of 5 (SD 3) sessions.
Those that consulted a clinical psychologist had a mean of 3 (SD 4) sessions.
Detailed patient demographics, referral sources, and clinical outcomes are presented in Tables1and2.
Follow‐up rates for KOOS and HOOS at 3 and 12 months are presented in Figure1.
Detailed clinical outcomes are presented in Figure2a,b, and Table2for both hospital sites.
Supporting InformationS1: Tables S1 and S2 present site‐specific outcomes for RPAH and TCH, respectively.
(a) KOOS dimensions at baseline, 3 months and 12 months follow‐up.
HOOS dimensions at baseline, 3 months and 12 months follow‐up.
At 3 and 12 months from baseline, all KOOS domains and the total score had mean improvements that were statistically significant (Table2).
For KOOS total score at 3 months, 38.6% (n= 186/482) of patients across all sites reached the MCI threshold, which rose to 52.1% (n= 101/194) at 12 months.
At 3 and 12 months from baseline, all HOOS domains and the total score were considered to have a mean improvement that was statistically significant (Table2).
For the HOOS total score 25.7% (n= 18/70) of patients reached the MCI threshold at 3 months and 30% (n= 6/20) at 12 months.
At 3 months, physical function improved a mean of 1.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.4) points, anxiety decreased a mean of −0.6 (95% CI −0.9 to −0.2), depression decreased a mean of −0.4 (95% CI −0.7 to −0.1), fatigue decreased a mean of −0.7 (95% CI −1.0 to −0.4), sleep disturbance decreased a mean of −0.7 (95% CI −0.9 to −0.4), social function improved a mean of 1.4 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.7), pain interference decreased by a mean of −1.7 (95% CI −2.0 to −1.4), and global pain rating decreased by a mean of −0.7 (95% CI −0.9 to −0.6).
All mean differences were considered statistically, but not clinically, significant.
At 12 months, physical function improved a mean of 1.4 (95% CI 0.9–1.9) points, anxiety decreased a mean of 0.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 0.1), depression decreased a mean of 0.2 (95% CI −0.3 to 0.7), fatigue decreased a mean of −0.8 (95% CI −1.4 to −0.3), sleep disturbance decreased a mean of −0.5 (95% CI −1.0 to −0.0), social function improved a mean of 1.3 (95% CI 0.8–1.9), pain interference decreased a mean of −2.1 (95% CI 2.7 to 1.6), and global pain rating decreased a mean of −0.9 (95% CI −1.3 to −0.6).
All mean differences were considered statistically, but not clinically, significant.
At 3 months from baseline, the mean difference in TUG was 2.1 s faster (95% CI −2.7 to −1.5), and at 12 months, 2.4 s faster (95% CI −3.0 to −1.8), which was statistically and clinically significant at both time‐points.
At 3 months 49% (n= 240/495) and at 12 months 37% (n= 71/193) of patients reached the MCI threshold for improvement in TUG.
At 3 months from baseline, the mean difference in the 40‐m walk speed was 0.1 m/s faster (95% CI 0.7 to 0.1) and at 12 months 0.2 m/s faster (95% CI 0.1–0.2), which was statistically and clinically significant at both time points.
At 3 months, 46% (n= 225/491) and at 12 months 58% (n= 111/190) of patients reached the MIC threshold for improvement in walking speed.
Participants in the overweight or obese BMI categories (n= 743/886, 83.9% of participants with BMI data at baseline) lost a mean of 0.7% (SD 2.3) of their bodyweight at 3 months and 1.0% (SD 5.0) at 12 months, which was not considered clinically significant.
Only 13% of all patients in the overweight or obese BMI categories at baseline were able to achieve weight loss of at least 5%.
However, there was a wide range in overall weight change in the cohort, from a loss of 17% to a gain of 14% at 12 months.
Multinomial mixed‐effects logistic regression was used to analyse associations with clinical improvement, set as reaching the MCI thresholds for improvement in KOOS scores at either 3 or 12 months.
Patient age, sex, BMI category and baseline scores (pain intensity and interference, KOOS) were not associated with reaching MCIs due to wide confidence intervals (Supporting InformationS1: Tables S3 and S4).
Logistic regression was not performed for HOOS scores due to low available data.
This study evaluated the outcomes of the OACCP in two metropolitan hospital clinics, focusing on patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and factors associated with clinically important improvement.
The results demonstrate that after completing a non‐surgical, multidisciplinary model of care people with hip and knee OA can significantly improve self‐reported outcomes and objective measures of physical performance.
Very few (∼13%) of all patients in the overweight or obese BMI categories at baseline were able to achieve weight loss of at least 5%.
None of the baseline measures were significantly predictive of outcomes.
The study has a large sample size from two metropolitan teaching hospitals.
Data collection was concurrent with clinical reviews during the 12 months of the programme incorporating routinely collected data, medical records and patient‐reported outcomes.
Objective measures were taken using standardised protocols.
Due to the nature of a retrospective analysis of real‐world routinely collected data, there are missing follow up data from patients that did not attend their 3‐ and 12‐month reviews.
COVID‐19 related restrictions on attendance of face‐to‐face clinical appointments also impacted follow up.
Long term KOOS scores for knee OA were only available for 21% of patients, and HOOS scores for 14% of hip OA patients, which is on par with similar studies (Cronström et al.2023).
This could reflect a wide range of clinical scenarios and include patients managing well with conservative care independently or those who chose to undergo surgery.
There was also a small subsample of people with hip OA, compared to knee OA; therefore, an analysis on associations with clinical improvement was not conducted for the hip OA group.
Interpretation of change in PROMIS‐29 scores is also limited as it may have poor responsiveness to change in a chronic OA population, with large ceiling effects (Katz et al.2017).
PROMIS‐29 raw scores were used because of a lack of a suitable reference population.
Summary data from the HOPE database are available regarding results of the OACCP at other hospital sites in New South Wales (n= 5600 for 19 sites in 2021) (NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation2023).
Baseline global pain ratings at SLHD sites were comparable to the statewide cohort (6.2 vs. 6.1).
However, mean global pain rating improved more in the SLHD cohort (0.9 points) than in the NSW cohort (0.2 points).
Baseline KOOS sub‐scores were also comparable to the statewide cohort.
However, long‐term outcomes were considerably better in the SLHD cohort.
Mean improvement at discharge across all KOOS domains in the NSW cohort was 17%, compared with 35% in the SLHD cohort.
It is unclear if this is due to differences in patient case‐mix, implementation of the programme or other factors that differ between sites that is delivery of care, patient demographics and variability in referral sources across hospital sites.
Mean improvements in objective physical function measures (e.g. 40m walk test) were the same as those in a longitudinal study of GLA:D program participants (n= 32,708) in three countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark) (Roos et al.2021).
No associations were found between pre‐treatment characteristics and clinical outcomes, which is consistent with prior studies (Eyles et al.2016).
The results of this study support the positive impact of the OACCP model of care on QOL and function, emphasising the importance of a tailored multidisciplinary approach being available to all patients for the management of hip and knee OA.
The study will contribute to continued improved service delivery and inform future randomised controlled trials of the service.
Future studies should assess outcomes beyond 12 months to provide insights into the sustainability of improvements and potential long‐term benefits of the programme.
Additionally, investigation to identify if transition from hospital to community‐based exercise programs could provide for prolonged and greater improvements in individuals undertaking non‐surgical management for knee or hip OA is desirable.
Comparative studies with other conservative care approaches can clarify the unique contributions of the OACCP model of care.
Important considerations for future research include the optimal timepoint to offer this model of care in the trajectory of OA as well as programme duration and intensity.
Future OACCP outcome measures could include body composition (muscle and body fat mass) to add to the clinical picture beyond BMI alone.
Additionally, recent studies (Bliddal et al.2024; Wei et al.2024) have shown that anti‐obesity medication is safe and effective for moderate weight loss in a population with knee OA.
Therefore, integration of pharmacologically assisted weight loss in the OACCP population is warranted.
The results demonstrate that following a multidisciplinary non‐surgical care programme, people with hip and knee OA can improve QOL and function after three months, and improvement was sustained up to 12 months in this patient cohort.
However, analysis was limited by low long‐term follow‐up rates and no control group.
