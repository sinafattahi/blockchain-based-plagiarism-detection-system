The decline in podiatry student enrolments at universities across Australia and New Zealand presents a workforce crisis that threatens the profession's sustainability and the delivery of essential healthcare services to communities.
Recent data highlight a limited understanding of the podiatry profession among allied health students.
There is now a clear need for strategies to address negative stereotypes and to build knowledge of the profession's scope of practice, career opportunities, job prospects and earning potential.
As part of a larger research initiative, this study explored student perspectives on marketing the podiatry profession to increase student enrolments.
A convergent mixed methods study design was employed.
Participants included students enrolled in (i) podiatry and (ii) relevant ‘non‐podiatry’ health, sport or science programs at nine Australian universities and one New Zealand university.
Data were collected via an online survey (278 podiatry students and 553 non‐podiatry students responding) and two online workshops with nine first‐year podiatry students.
Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression models, while qualitative data underwent inductive thematic analysis by three independent assessors.
We integrated the data by exploring the connections between the quantitative and qualitative findings.
Findings revealed that over 40% of podiatry students had initial concerns about their course and 34.2% had considered leaving.
Instagram and Facebook were identified as the most influential social media platforms for sourcing information about courses and careers.
Four over‐arching themes emerged as important marketing strategies for increasing student enrolments: (i) enhance the visibility, perception and advocacy of podiatry; (ii) emphasise holistic and diverse practice in podiatry; (iii) enable early exposure and experience of podiatry practice and (iv) improve course entry pathways and flexibility.
An evidence‐based approach is required to enhance the visibility and appeal of podiatry as a career.
Strategies should focus on addressing misconceptions about the discipline, expanding promotional efforts to broader audiences, leveraging relevant media platforms, reducing financial and academic barriers for prospective students, and improving study flexibility.
Strengthening enrolments and reducing attrition are fundamental to ensuring the sustainability and growth of the podiatry profession in Australia and New Zealand.
The podiatry profession in Australia and New Zealand, along with broader global trends [1,2,3], is facing a critical workforce challenge, primarily driven by a decline in student enrolments in undergraduate programs [4,5,6].
Despite the well‐established value of podiatry in healthcare, the apparent diminishing interest or lack of awareness about the profession among prospective students [1,2,4] threatens the viability of university programs.
This downward trend poses significant concerns for the sustainability and future growth of the profession [1,2,4].
A reduced inflow of podiatry graduates to the profession will risk workforce shortages, increase burnout [7] and compromise healthcare delivery [4].
The consequences of these shortages are particularly pronounced in rural and remote areas, where gaps in podiatry services exacerbate health inequities and limit access to essential care [8,9,10].
Our recent study [4] found that allied health students have a limited understanding of the podiatry profession and highlighted actions to address negative podiatry stereotypes, shift perceptions of podiatry and build knowledge of the profession's scope of practice, career pathways/opportunities, job prospects and earning potential [1,2,4].
These insights provide a foundation for promoting podiatry programs; however, a deeper exploration of students' perspectives on marketing the profession is needed.
Understanding student viewpoints could provide a nuanced perspective on which messages resonate and which may deter prospective students, enabling more effective marketing planning.
Such research is essential for developing evidence‐based marketing strategies and campaigns that enable key stakeholders to effectively showcase the aspects of podiatry which prospective students will find appealing.
Through strategic marketing, we aim to address the student enrolment crisis that threatens the viability of podiatry programs, a key factor contributing to the shortage of podiatry professionals [1,2,4].
By attracting students whose career aspirations align with the rewards of the profession, this could mitigate workforce shortages by fostering a continuous stream of future podiatrists.
These initiatives are likely to have a broader impact on improving the sustainability and growth of the podiatry profession.
This study serves as an extension of our previous work [4], with a distinct emphasis on marketing the podiatry profession from the student perspective.
Therefore, this study aimed to explore student perspectives on marketing the podiatry profession to inform strategies for increasing student enrolments and sustaining the workforce in Australia and New Zealand.
This study was approved by the relevant institutional Human Research and Ethics Committees (HEC21057; 21/161; 22978;H21077; 2021/043; H‐2021‐0276; 203889; 2021/ET000372;H14404), and all participants provided informed consent prior to data collection [4].
Employing a convergent mixed methods design, this study gathered and analysed both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently, with integration achieved through merging [11,12].
The findings are presented in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) framework and the Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) checklist [13,14].
The completed GRAMMS checklist is available in Supporting InformationS1.
Our research team was comprised of academics with diverse expertise in quantitative and qualitative research in foot and ankle pathology, chronic disease, health promotion and culturally responsive practice [4].
This diversity ensured robust analysis and interpretation of findings.
Students from first to third (or fourth) year in podiatry and relevant non‐podiatry programs at nine Australian universities and one New Zealand university were invited to participate in an online survey.
A ‘relevant non‐podiatry program’ encompassed any health, sport or health‐related science program from universities that offered a podiatry program (students within these programs hereinafter referred to as ‘non‐podiatry students’).
The non‐podiatry programs included nursing, physiotherapy, exercise science, occupational therapy, speech pathology, dietetics/nutrition, orthoptics, prosthetics and orthotics and various science programs (e.g., health science and biomedicine).
Invitations to participate in the online workshops were extended to all first‐year podiatry students from four participating universities [4].
An a priori sample size calculation determined that 264 participants were required for the podiatry student survey portion of this study.
This calculation was based on the following: (i) 880 podiatry students across all universities, (ii) expected response rate of ∼30%, (iii) a confidence level of 95% and (iv) a margin of error of 5% [4,15].
Our sample size for the workshops (n= 9) aligned with qualitative research guidelines [16,17] to ensure that diverse student perspectives were captured, while fostering focused interactions.
Podiatry Program Leads from 10 university podiatry programs across Australia and New Zealand were approached via email with an invitation to participate in this study.
Only one institution chose not to participate.
Following confirmation of participating podiatry programs, invitations were also extended to Program Leads from related non‐podiatry disciplines at those universities.
Online survey data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at La Trobe University [18,19].
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, USA) is a secure web‐based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies [18,19].
The online survey consisted of two separate versions: one for podiatry students and one for non‐podiatry students.
Both surveys included a mix of open and closed questions and are available as supplementary files in a previous publication [4].
The surveys included questions on demographics as well as the motivators and barriers for the students' respective career choices.
The podiatry survey also included questions on marketing of the profession, whereas the non‐podiatry survey included questions on knowledge and perceptions of the podiatry profession.
The podiatry survey component was initially piloted on first‐year podiatry students (n= 30; response rate of 29.7%) at three Australian universities.
Based on feedback from the pilot, the survey was refined to create the version used in this study.
An email invitation containing a survey link was sent to podiatry and non‐podiatry students by a university staff member, such as the year‐level coordinator.
Interested students were invited to complete the survey at their own convenience.
To maximise participation, reminder emails (three in total) were sent weekly over a 4‐week data collection period.
The survey was accessible online from 7 March 2022 to 14 April 2022.
The workshops were conducted via Zoom videoconferencing [20] and followed a co‐design workshop approach known as ‘CoLabs’ [21].
Scaffolded participatory design activities were employed in the workshops, incorporating a range of activities designed to foster student reflection and feedback, as well as generate ideas [21].
Our previous publication provides full details of the workshop activities [4]; however, a brief overview is provided here for context.
In the first activity, students used Jamboard electronic whiteboard (Google Inc.) to create a mind map capturing their initial thoughts and associations with the word ‘podiatry’.
The second activity required students to contribute to an online discussion forum using the Padlet software, where students reflected on personal motivators and barriers related to studying podiatry and offered suggestions for improving how the profession is marketed.
In the final activity, students collaborated in small groups to co‐create a recruitment campaign for podiatry.
This included identifying key selling points, outlining dissemination strategies and highlighting unique aspects of the profession.
All data generated from the workshop activities were collated in NVivo (Lumivero).
All workshops were conducted within an 8‐day period, commencing in March 2022.
Descriptive statistics summarised participant characteristics and data obtained from the closed survey questions.
Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages.
Continuous data were expressed as mean (standard deviation, SD) or median (interquartile range, IQR).
Parametric statistical methods were applied to normally distributed data, whereas non‐parametric methods were used for data that did not follow a normal distribution.
To explore between‐group differences (e.g., podiatry and non‐podiatry students), independent samplest‐tests, Mann–WhitneyUtests and/or Chi‐squared tests were used.
Associations between personal and professional factors that influence perceptions on marketing strategies for podiatry and non‐podiatry students were explored using linear and/or logistic regression (depending on data type) and were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
For missing data, casewise deletion was used for any variables included in regression models with missing data.
All statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Statistical significance was set at the two‐sided conventional level of ≤ 0.05.
Themes were developed from open questions in the online survey provided by podiatry (n= 278) and non‐podiatry (n= 553) students as well as qualitative data collected in the podiatry student workshops (n= 9).
All data were initially collated in Microsoft Excel (Redmond, Washington, USA) and analysed using inductive thematic analysis by three independent assessors (CR, MH and MC).
NVivo software (Lumivero) was used for coding, and final themes were established through consensus.
Thematic analysis followed the six‐phase process described by Braun and Clarke [16]: (i) data familiarisation, (ii) initial coding, (iii) theme searching, (iv) reviewing themes, (v) defining and naming themes and (vi) manuscript preparation.
Employing a convergent mixed methods design, this study gathered and analysed both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently, with integration achieved through merging [11,12].
Specifically, we evaluated whether the results from each type of analysis were consistent or divergent.
Furthermore, we highlighted which elements of the quantitative data were not addressed in the qualitative study and vice versa.
Integration of findings derived from each analysis was undertaken by researchers MRK, CR, MC and MH.
Tables that aligned findings from both datasets were used to enable comparisons and data integration.
A total of 278 podiatry students and 553 non‐podiatry students participated in the online survey, with strong representation from all year levels (mean age 24.9 [SD, 8.5], 65.1% female for podiatry students and mean age 24.8 [SD, 8.2], 75.4% female for non‐podiatry students).
Nine first‐year podiatry students from Australia (two females and two males) and New Zealand (five females) participated in the online workshops.
Participant characteristics are provided in Table1and our previous publication [4].
The non‐podiatry group included students from 13 disciplines, with a notable proportion from physiotherapy (32.2%) and occupational therapy (29.1%).
Overall, the majority of students were enrolled full‐time (92.4% of podiatry students and 85.9% of non‐podiatry students) and many held prior qualifications (45.7% of podiatry students and 39.4% of non‐podiatry students).
Missing data were for ‘Age’ (podiatry,n= 1), ‘Prior educational qualifications’ (podiatry,n= 1), ‘Year of study’ (non‐podiatry,n= 1), ‘International student’ (non‐podiatry,n= 1), ‘Encountered barriers to studying podiatry’ (podiatry,n= 25), ‘Concerns about studying podiatry’ (podiatry,n= 25) and ‘Considering leaving their course’ (podiatry,n= 25 and non‐podiatry,n= 80).
Non‐podiatry group only responded if reported that they had considered studying podiatry (n= 50).
The themes presented in this paper represent contributions from podiatry and non‐podiatry students, with a primary focus on student perspectives for marketing the podiatry profession and course promotion.
The inter‐relationships between the themes are illustrated in Figure1.
Four over‐arching themes and 11 subthemes were identified.
The over‐arching themes were as follows: (i) enhance the visibility, perception and advocacy of podiatry; (ii) emphasise holistic and diverse practice in podiatry; (iii) enable early exposure and experience of podiatry practice and (iv) improve course entry pathways and flexibility.
Overview of student perspectives on marketing the podiatry profession and course promotion.
Quantitative findings supported these perspectives, highlighting the factors podiatry students found particularly attractive about the profession.
Compared to the non‐podiatry students, podiatry students were significantlymore likelyto think that job prospects after graduation (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.05,p= 0.050), the prospect of owning a business (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.69,p< 0.001) and the ability to work in hospitals (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.87,p= 0.001) were attractive factors.
Based on our quantitative data, many of the non‐podiatry students elected to study their chosen course because they had a first‐hand positive experience with the profession (e.g., they may have been treated by a physiotherapist previously and recovered well).
In contrast, podiatry students weremore likelyto choose podiatry if they failed to get into another course (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.90,p< 0.001) or they heard about the profession from a current podiatry student (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.49,p= 0.026) compared to students in other health disciplines.
When patients share their positive experiences with others, they become effective ambassadors for the profession, helping to generate interest among potential future podiatrists.
Students thought that word of mouth, fuelled by these first‐hand accounts, may be a powerful tool for reaching new audiences and encouraging them to consider a career in podiatry.

Multiple logistic regression analyses exploring factors associated with non‐podiatry students considering podiatry as a career choice.
Multiple logistic regression analyses exploring student perceptions on social media platforms and advertising platforms for the promotion of podiatry courses and careers.
The quantitative data showed that compared to the non‐podiatry students, podiatry students weremore likelyto first hear about the profession from a family member (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.13,p= 0.025) or different health professional (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.22,p= 0.005) andless likelyto receive this information from school teachers (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.90,p= 0.029), professional websites (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43,p< 0.001) or during work experience (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.77,p= 0.002; Table5).
Multiple logistic regression analyses exploring factors associated with first hearing about podiatry.
It would be good if there were more ways to introduce podiatry to the community or students, especially international students, about what podiatry is, what we do, advantages they can get etc.
More exposure for podiatry would be great, especially if we can get involved with students at high school directly prior to their final years of high school.
We need to ensure that we talk about the diverse skill set which comes from podiatry and the opportunities available after graduation.
As from my experiences during high school other students and even teachers did not know what a podiatrist was and if they did, they only thought they performed general skin and nail care, however, many students are interested in sports or working in hospitals so if we can promote those skills more it might help to change the stereotype surrounding podiatry.
Our quantitative data show that although the majority of students perceived their career choices as rewarding, the non‐podiatry students rated their career choices as more rewarding than the podiatry students and they were also more likely to recommend their career to peers.
On average, using a 100‐point scale (0 = ‘not rewarding’ to 100 = ‘very rewarding’), podiatry students rated their perceptions of career choice as less rewarding than the non‐podiatry students (81.9 [SD, 15.7] vs. 88.2 [SD, 11.7]; mean difference 6.3,p< 0.001).
Non‐podiatry students were significantly more likely to recommend their course as a career compared to the podiatry students (p< 0.001).
When asked about the promotion of podiatry courses and career opportunities relative to other allied health courses, both podiatry and non‐podiatry students rated the promotion poorly.
On average, using a 100‐point scale (0 = ‘not well promoted’ to 100 = ‘very well promoted’), podiatry students rated the promotion of podiatry courses at 33.1 out of 100 (SD, 23.4) and career opportunities at 42.2 out of 100 (SD, 26.1).
In comparison, non‐podiatry students rated the promotion of podiatry courses at 25.9 out of 100 (SD, 18.3) and career opportunities at 26.0 out of 100 (SD, 20.1).
These ratings were significantly lower than those of the podiatry students (mean difference of 7.2 for courses and 16.2 for career opportunities;p< 0.001 (Table2).
This is the first study to gather insights and perspectives from current podiatry and non‐podiatry students on marketing strategies aimed at promoting the podiatry profession and the courses available.
In doing so, approaches that enhance the profession's appeal to prospective students to increase enrolments into entry‐level podiatry programs were identified.
The findings indicate that addressing misconceptions about the discipline, engaging key stakeholders and expanding target audiences via a range of marketing platforms could enhance the visibility and appeal of podiatry as a career.
Reducing barriers to entry and offering flexible study options could further attract and retain more students.
This discussion provides actionable insights for improving the promotion of podiatry, highlighting key messages, ideal promoters and most effective platforms to reach target audiences.
Ultimately, these efforts may support the sustainability and growth of the podiatry profession through increased enrolments in podiatry education programs.
Misconceptions about podiatry, particularly among non‐podiatry students, emerged as a significant theme in this study and our previous work [4].
Many students viewed the profession as limited to foot care, such as toenail trimming, and were surprised to learn about its broader scope of practice, including roles in musculoskeletal care, paediatrics, falls prevention and reducing lower limb related complications of chronic disease, such as diabetes.
Addressing these misconceptions is critical to enhancing the profession's appeal.
Efforts should focus on highlighting the diverse career opportunities within podiatry, such as its contributions to preventative healthcare, mobility improvement and quality of life.
In addition to broadening perceptions, it is important to address negative assumptions about podiatry, particularly regarding salary expectations and ethical practices in private practice.
Providing students with a realistic understanding of the profession's challenges and rewards is essential.
Transparent information, such as the comparability of podiatry salaries with other allied health professions [22] and the consistently high professional standards maintained by podiatrists, can help dispel these misconceptions.
For example, data from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency annual report 2022/2023 [23] indicate that complaints against podiatrists have remained stable or decreased, reflecting strong professional conduct within the field [23].
Highlighting these strengths could enhance the overall perception of podiatry and present it as a dynamic and rewarding career choice.
Although the majority of podiatry students perceived their career choice to be rewarding (81.9/100), it was rated significantly less compared to the non‐podiatry students (88.2/100).
Non‐podiatry students were also significantly more likely to recommend their chosen field to others.
These findings align with the ongoing challenge of negative perceptions around podiatry, often seen as limited to foot care or being less dynamic than other allied health professions [4].
Podiatry's relatively low visibility within the broader health sector contributes to this limited understanding, highlighting the need to more clearly showcase the profession's diverse career opportunities and full breadth of scope.
Current marketing strategies for podiatry courses may not be reaching their full potential.
Both podiatry and non‐podiatry students in this study perceived the promotion of podiatry courses and career opportunities as poor, with non‐podiatry students rating these promotional efforts significantly lower.
This finding highlights the need for targeted strategies aimed at specific audiences, such as domestic high school students and international students, to improve awareness and appeal.
Early engagement with these groups, particularly during critical career decision‐making periods, could positively influence perceptions of podiatry.
For example, integrating foot health education into school curricula and conducting interactive school visits may help to demystify the profession and emphasise its vital role in overall health and wellbeing.
These activities could foster a broader understanding of podiatry's scope and inspire prospective students to consider it as a dynamic and rewarding career choice.
Mature‐age students and course transfer students represent additional opportunities for targeted recruitment.
These groups often bring valuable life experience and clear career goals, which can enrich the profession.
For these students, recruitment strategies should be tailored to emphasise how their existing skills and knowledge could be applied in podiatry, in addition to highlighting career and study flexibility, opportunities for professional growth and the ability to make a meaningful impact in patient care.
By broadening the potential candidate pool and addressing the unique needs of these groups, marketing efforts could present podiatry as an inclusive and rewarding career option for individuals from a wide range of personal and professional contexts.
Historically, podiatry courses have been marketed through traditional methods such as university open days, career exhibitions and roadshows.
These events typically feature a broad range of courses, leaving prospective students to ‘discover’ podiatry on their own.
Our previous research [4] and studies from the United Kingdom [1,2] identified a general lack of awareness among allied health students regarding the scope of practice, career opportunities, job prospects and earning potential in podiatry.
This could explain our findings that podiatry is not a first‐choice career option for many, with 35.3% of podiatry students advising that it was not their first choice when applying to study, compared to just 11.5% of non‐podiatry students.
Although social media platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, are commonly used by both podiatry and non‐podiatry students, more formal avenues, such as university websites, high school career talks and career exhibitions and roadshows, were rated as being more effective for promoting careers and courses.
This suggests that although social media is widely used, this brief format may not always provide the depth of information needed for informed career decisions.
However, platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, present significant opportunities to reach prospective students and address misconceptions about the discipline.
Content should aim to display podiatry as a dynamic and impactful career by highlighting its broader health impacts and diverse career pathways.
For instance, students suggested videos featuring ‘a day in the life of a podiatrist’ or testimonials from podiatry practitioners working in areas, such as sports medicine, paediatrics or high‐risk foot care, may help to portray podiatry as a meaningful and rewarding career choice.
By strategically leveraging social media alongside more formal promotional efforts, stakeholders could create a balanced approach to attract a wide range of prospective students.
Our study highlights the under‐explored potential for podiatry practitioners and podiatry students to serve as ambassadors for the profession.
Podiatry students often first encounter podiatry through personal connections with someone in the profession, suggesting that first‐hand advocacy could play a crucial role in raising awareness and promoting the profession.
Encouraging podiatrists and podiatry students to actively participate in career events or produce engaging social media content could enhance the profession's visibility and appeal.
By showcasing the dynamic and impactful aspects of podiatry in their daily interactions, practitioners could inspire prospective students to view it as a meaningful and rewarding career choice.
This approach reinforces the importance of a collective effort across the profession to promote its full potential.
To modernise the image of podiatry and to shift the narrative away from a focus on feet, marketing strategies should emphasise its hands‐on nature, advanced technology and cutting‐edge techniques.
Promoting roles, such as sports‐related care, opportunities for international practice and diverse work environments, could help breakdown negative stereotypes and broaden the profession's appeal.
Highlighting the strong employment prospects, earning potential and pathways to business ownership further demonstrates the tangible benefits of a career in podiatry.
The podiatry brand requires a makeover to showcase contemporary practice, dispel negative stereotypes and misconceptions and position it as a rewarding and forward‐thinking career choice to prospective students.
First‐hand exposure to the profession is another critical component in shaping prospective students' understanding of podiatry.
Observing or working alongside a podiatrist could provide invaluable insights into the clinical and interpersonal aspects of the field and potentially influence student career choices.
Universities and podiatry practitioners could collaborate to create structured opportunities for shadowing, clinical sessions or inter‐professional education activities.
These experiences may help prospective students appreciate the breadth of podiatry's scope of practice, while empowering them to share these insights with peers and family, amplifying advocacy efforts.
Improving the accessibility and attractiveness of podiatry programs is essential for addressing workforce shortages and expanding the pool of qualified practitioners.
Financial challenges were highlighted as a significant barrier for many students, emphasising the need for expanded government‐funded scholarships, grants and loan options.
A subsidy model, similar to those used for teachers and healthcare workers in rural areas, could be adapted for podiatry to attract high‐quality students while addressing workforce needs.
Further, offering mentorship programs as part of financial support packages could help improve retention and provide additional career development for graduates.
Podiatry apprenticeships, shown to be promising within the United Kingdom [3], could be explored in Australia and New Zealand for enhancing student recruitment and retention.
Reducing barriers to entry into podiatry programs were identified as an important strategy, particularly for mature‐age students, international students and those seeking to transfer into podiatry from other fields.
International students require clear guidelines and support services to ensure qualification equivalency is clear, as uncertainty could dissuade them from pursuing podiatry in Australia or New Zealand.
In addition, scholarships targeting international students could help alleviate the financial burden.
Transfer students and those with prior qualifications also highlighted the need for improved recognition of prior study.
Credit transfer pathways were identified as a factor in reducing the length and cost of podiatry programs, ultimately making the discipline more appealing.
Traditional university timetables and course structures do not always align with the needs of today's students.
Greater flexibility, such as offering evening or weekend classes, part‐time or remote learning options (as appropriate) and intensive blocks for on‐campus practical skill training may help accommodate diverse lifestyles.
Increased use of asynchronous and synchronous learning technologies, such as recorded lectures and skill demonstration videos, is also encouraged.
Micro‐credentialing, short courses and undergraduate certificate programs could provide modular and accessible pathways into the profession.
Revising curricula to align with current practice requirements, establishing satellite campuses and partnering with local healthcare facilities for work‐integrated learning placements could further reduce the impact of geographic distance and improve accessibility to podiatry study.
These findings should be viewed considering the study's limitations, as detailed within our previous publication [4], including: (i) some closed‐ended survey questions may have limited deeper responses, though free‐text options and qualitative workshops allowed exploration of student experiences and perceptions further; (ii) incomplete survey responses were excluded using casewise deletion from regression models, and the survey, though piloted with 30 first‐year podiatry students, was not validated; (iii) participation may have been affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic and competing educational demands; (iv) respondent ethnicity, including Indigenous status, was not recorded to protect respondent anonymity, potentially limiting generalisability in Australia and New Zealand [4]; (v) marketing strategies were derived solely from the student perspective, without input from the broader stakeholders, which may limit the scope of the recommendations and (vi) the average age of the participants was 25 years, which may skew findings towards younger perspectives, though 60.4% of the sample were mature‐age students who did not enrol in their courses immediately after high school.
The findings should also be considered in light of the study's strengths, including: (i) it is the first to explore marketing strategies for promoting podiatry through the student lens; (ii) it used a large sample size, comprising 278 podiatry students and 553 non‐podiatry students (across 13 disciplines), representing approximately 32% of podiatry students across Australia and New Zealand; (iii) the integration of quantitative and qualitative data revealed key themes (such as enhancing podiatry’s visibility, advocating its diverse practice, enabling early exposure and improving entry pathways) whereas qualitative data provided additional insights, particularly on the role of social media, to add richness to the quantitative data; (iv) it provides actionable insights for enhancing marketing strategies and campaigns in podiatry, which could serve as a benchmark for future initiatives and (v) the findings are not only relevant to podiatry programs in Australia and New Zealand but may also have implications for podiatry programs internationally who are facing similar workforce challenges, such as those in the United Kingdom [1,2,3].
Foster mutually beneficial relationships among current students, alumni and industry partners to co‐create innovative promotional initiatives and cultivate a shared commitment to advocacy for the profession.
This study provides a valuable resource for universities in Australia and New Zealand (and perhaps more broadly) in designing marketing campaigns to enhance the visibility of podiatry programs and to highlight the diverse career opportunities within the profession.
Key stakeholders, such as the Australian Podiatry Association and Podiatry New Zealand, may use these findings to create campaigns that resonate with prospective students.
The broader impact of this research extends to the long‐term growth and sustainability of the podiatry profession through advancing research, advocating at the government level, meeting the ever‐increasing demand for patient care and generating meaningful employment opportunities.
By fostering these areas, the podiatry profession can continue to evolve, thrive and maintain its relevance in an ever‐changing landscape.
In conclusion, the findings highlight that although podiatry is seen as a rewarding career by those who pursue it, there is much work to be done in raising awareness and promoting the full scope of practice and career opportunities within the field.
By targeting specific audiences, leveraging social media more effectively, enabling early exposure to podiatry practice and empowering podiatrists and podiatry students to act as ambassadors, the profession can be promoted more effectively and attract a more diverse range of students.
Addressing the negative stereotypes and misconceptions about podiatry and emphasising its role in holistic healthcare is key to reshaping the public's perception of the discipline and improving student recruitment.
Improving course entry pathways, offering greater flexibility for study and reducing barriers to entry will enhance student recruitment and retention.
Ultimately, these efforts are vital for increasing student enrolments, reducing attrition and ensuring the continued growth and sustainability of the podiatry profession in Australia and New Zealand.
