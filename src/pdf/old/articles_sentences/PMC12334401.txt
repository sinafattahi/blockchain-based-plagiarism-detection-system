Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pathological vascular remodeling driven by pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation.
While METTL14-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification has been implicated in PAH, the upstream regulators and downstream effectors linking m6A to PASMC dysregulation remain unclear.
This study investigates the role of SETD2, a histone methyltransferase, in driving METTL14-dependent m6A modifications to promote PAH via Piezo1 and transglutaminase 2 (TGM2).
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to hypoxia, and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were periodically stretched to establish PAH models in vivo and in vitro.
The epigenetic regulation of METTL14 by SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).
Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequence (MeRIP-seq), RNA-seq, and dual-luciferase reporter gene data were used to determine whether METTL14 enhances the expression of Piezo1 in an m6A-dependent manner.
To analyze comparisons between multiple datasets, one-way ANOVA was used.
METTL14 overexpression increased PASMC proliferation by 1.45-fold (vs. controls) and elevated global m6A levels by 1.73-fold in total RNA and 1.43-fold in poly A + RNA.
SETD2-driven H3K36me3 histone modification upregulated METTL14 expression by 1.76-fold, amplifying m6A deposition.
In hypoxia-induced PAH mice, METTL14 overexpression exacerbated hemodynamic severity, increasing right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) by 29% and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) by 33% (vs. hypoxia alone).
SETD2 knockout in PASMCs reduced RVSP by 24%, mPAP by 28%, and pulmonary artery media thickness (PAMT) by 29%, while decreasing m6A levels by 48%.
Piezo1 mRNA stability increased by 2.36-fold via METTL14-mediated m6A modification at adenosine 1080, elevating Piezo1 protein expression by 3.58-fold in PASMCs.
Piezo1 overexpression increased intracellular Ca²⁺ influx, driving TGM2 activity by 1.79-fold and restoring PASMC proliferation despite SETD2 deficiency.
This study identifies a novel SETD2/H3K36me3/METTL14/m6A axis that stabilizes Piezo1 mRNA, promoting Ca²⁺-dependent TGM2 activation and PASMC proliferation in PAH.
Targeting this pathway—via SETD2, METTL14, or Piezo1 inhibition—may offer therapeutic potential to ameliorate vascular remodeling in PAH.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined as the formation of characteristic plexiform lesions caused by intimal hyperplasia, media hypertrophy and peripheral membrane proliferation of pulmonary arterioles, resulting in continuous pulmonary artery contraction and progressive occlusion [1–3].
Historically considered a uniformly fatal disease with a 10-year mortality rate of 30–40%, recent advances in targeted therapies have significantly improved survival, with 5-year survival rates now exceeding 60% in treated cohorts [4].
However, PAH remains a high-risk condition, particularly in subgroups such as connective tissue disease-associated PAH (CTD-PAH), where long-term survival remains suboptimal despite aggressive management.
The therapeutic landscape has evolved dramatically with the FDA approval of sotatercept, a first-in-class activin receptor IIA-Fc fusion protein that reverses vascular remodeling by restoring balance between pro- and anti-proliferative signaling pathways (e.g., TGF-β/BMPR2).
In the pivotal STELLAR trial, sotatercept reduced clinical worsening risk by 84% and improved 6-minute walk distance by 40.8 m compared to placebo, marking a paradigm shift in addressing the root cause of vascular pathology rather than merely alleviating symptoms.
Despite these advances, disease progression persists in many patients, underscoring the need to elucidate novel molecular drivers of PAH beyond canonical pathways.
With the continuous progress in the field of RNA modification, the key role of epigenetics in gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation is becoming clear.
It is worth noting that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most prevalent internal modification in mRNA and plays an irreplaceable role in regulating gene expression and determining cell fate [5].
Histone methylation is based on the methylation of specific methylated residues, including lysine or arginine, affecting transcriptional or post-translational modifications [6].
It was found that histone lysine methylation (HKM) as an epigenetic regulation mode plays a key role in the proliferation, migration and contraction of PASMCs [7].
In addition, other studies indicated that SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) is critical in the cardiovascular system and that deletion of SETD2 can lead to vascular remodeling defects and lethal embryonic damage [8].
During transcription, the interaction between SETD2 and m6A RNA modifications controls gene expression.
SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 can recognize and bind METTL14, recruit the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC) to mRNA, increase RNA polymerase II activity, and enhance the m6A level of post-transcriptional mRNA [9].
Emerging evidence highlights epigenetic dysregulation as a central mechanism in PAH pathogenesis.
Among epigenetic modifiers, m6A—the most abundant internal mRNA modification—has emerged as a critical regulator of vascular pathology.
m6A dynamics, governed by “writers” (e.g., METTL3, METTL14), “erasers” (e.g., FTO, ALKBH5), and “readers” (e.g., YTHDF proteins), control RNA stability, splicing, and translation [10].
Recent studies implicate m6A dysregulation in PAH: Inhibition of METTL3 by STM2457 and Loss of Macrophage METTL3 Alleviate Pulmonary Hypertension and Right Heart Remodeling [11].
FTO, an m6A eraser, its deletion mitigates hypoxia-induced PAH [12].
Loss of m6A demethylase ALKBH5 alleviates hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension via inhibiting Cyp1a1 mRNA decay [13].
Our prior work uniquely identified METTL14—a critical scaffolding component of the m6A methyltransferase complex—as a hypoxia-sensitive driver of PAH [14].
In hypoxia-induced PAH models, SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 recruits METTL14 to enhance m6A deposition, amplifying PASMC hyperproliferation and vascular remodeling.
While METTL3 and FTO have been studied in PAH, METTL14’s role is distinct: its interaction with histone modifiers like SETD2 creates an epigenetic-metabolic feedback loop that perpetuates vascular pathology under hypoxia.
However, the downstream effectors linking this epigenetic axis to pathological vascular remodeling remain poorly defined, particularly in non-hypoxic PAH models.
This mechanistic uniqueness justifies our focus on METTL14 rather than other m6A regulators in the current study.
Shear stress is fundamental to cardiovascular biomechanics, and Piezo1, a recently discovered stretch-activated ion channel, is widespread throughout the cardiovascular system [15].
Notably, intense pulmonary artery contraction induced by increased shear stress stimulation of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs) plays a vital role in malignant pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH [16].
Piezo1, a core member of SACs, senses exogenous pressure and promotes Ca2+influx [17].
Sustained activation of Piezo1 in SMCs significantly increases intracellular Ca2+concentration, which in turn activates transglutaminase2 (TGM2) and promotes arteriolar remodeling in hypertensive patients [18].
While Piezo1-TGM2 signaling is mechanistically plausible in PAH, the regulatory interplay between epigenetic RNA modifications and this mechanotransduction cascade has never been investigated.
Furthermore, whether m6A modulates Piezo1 expression or activity—and how this impacts TGM2-driven vascular pathology—remains unknown.
In this study, we uncover two novel mechanistic axes that expand the understanding of PAH pathogenesis beyond canonical hypoxia-driven pathways.
First, we demonstrate that SETD2/METTL14-mediated m6A modifications suppress Piezo1 mRNA stability, attenuating its expression and disrupting calcium homeostasis in PASMCs.
Second, we identify TGM2 as a critical downstream effector of Piezo1 attenuation, where reduced Piezo1 activity unleashes TGM2-driven vascular remodeling independent of hypoxia.
These findings reveal an unprecedented link between epitranscriptomic regulation (m6A), mechanosensitive ion channel dynamics (Piezo1), and post-translational matrix modulation (TGM2) in PAH.
By delineating how m6A-dependent RNA decay of Piezo1 licenses TGM2 activation, this work provides a transformative perspective on PAH pathophysiology and positions the SETD2/METTL14-Piezo1-TGM2 axis as a therapeutic target worthy of clinical exploration.
All the animal experiments adhered to the NIH guidelines.
The Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanchang University approved the protocols (Approval No. CDYFYIACUC-202412QR005).
SM22 (α-SMA-Cre) transgenic mice (8 weeks old, weighing 18–22 g, male, SPF grade) were obtained from Shanghai Slack Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

Conventional homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells was employed to mate SETD2fl/flC57BL/6 mice with SM22(α-SMA-Cre) C57BL/6 mice, thereby obtaining C57BL/6 mice that express two Flox and Cre enzymes.
The SETD2 gene was then knocked out in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), resulting in the generation of SETD2−/−C57BL/6 mice [14].
The C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old, weighing 18–22 g, male, SPF grade) were randomly divided into two groups: the normoxia group, which was exposed to indoor air, and the hypoxia group, which was placed in a ventilation chamber with 10% O₂ and < 0.5% CO₂ achieved by mixing indoor air with nitrogen.

The following measurements were taken: right ventricular end-systolic diameter (RVESD), right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESV), right ventricular end-diastolic diameter (RVEDD), right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), right ventricular fraction of contraction (RVFS), right ventricular posterior wall thickness (RVPWT), and ventricular septal thickness (IVST).
The data were averaged over 3 consecutive cardiac cycles.
The right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and the RR interval-adjusted pulmonary artery flow acceleration time (PAAT) were calculated.
All echocardiographic studies were analyzed in a blinded manner.
Following echocardiography, a pressure sensor (FTH-1211B-0018, Primetech) with a 25-G needle was inserted into the right external jugular vein for the measurement of right ventricular mean pressure (RVMP), right cardiac displacement (RVCO), and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP).
Systolic body pressure (SBP) and systemic arterial pressure (mSAP) were measured via left carotid artery intubation.
All calculations were performed via LabChart8 (ADInstruments) to determine the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and total pulmonary resistance (TPR) on the basis of the ratio of mPAP to RVCO.
Following the hemodynamic examination, all the animals were euthanized via CO₂ inhalation and underwent thoracotomy.
The heart and lungs were excised, and the left and right lung tissues were dissected and utilized for vascular studies [21].

In brief, approximately 50–100 mg of total RNA was isolated and fragmented via RNA fragment buffer, with 1/10 of the RNA fragment serving as the input group.
A/G magnetic beads were then prewashed and combined with an anti-m6A antibody.
Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) reaction buffer was added to A/G magnetic beads, which were subsequently incubated at 4°C for 2 h. The conjugates were purified and eluted with a Magen Hipure serum/plasma miRNA kit (Magen, Guangzhou, China) for subsequent qPCR analysis.

In vitro studies found that the activity and proliferation capacity of hPASMCs were significantly increased in PAH group, and it is worth noting that CSMETTL14group showed the most obvious enhancement (Fig.1A, B).
Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of cell proliferation markers were markedly elevated in the experimental group.
Among these, the CSMETTL14group presented the most pronounced increase (Fig.1C).
These findings indicate that the overexpression of METTL14 markedly enhances the proliferation of PASMCs.
The levels of mRNA m6A in total RNA and poly A + RNA were subsequently quantified via a colorimetric assay.
Compared with that in the control group, the expression level of m6A in PASMCs in the PAH group was markedly increased, with the CSMETTL14group serving as the primary focus (Fig.1D, E).
Furthermore, dot blot analysis confirmed that the total m6A level was markedly elevated in PASMCs transfected with a METTL14 overexpression virus (Fig.1F).
Western blotting further confirmed that METTL14 expression was significantly upregulated in the PAH group (Fig.1C).
In conclusion, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that METTL14 increased the m6A level in SMCs and facilitated the proliferation of PASMCs.
To investigate the effect of METTL14 on PAH in vivo, we conducted an in vivo experimental study.
First, the METTL14 vectors were delivered into the trachea by a 24G catheter to infect the lungs of C57BL/6 mice [27].
The right heart catheter test demonstrated that, compared with those in the normoxia group, the RVMP, RVSP, TPR, and mPAP were markedly elevated in the hypoxia group, whereas the RVOC was notably decreased.
The HypoxiaMETTL14group presented the most pronounced alterations.
However, no significant differences were observed in SBP or mSAP among the groups (Supplementary Fig.1A).
The above study revealed that the PAH model was successfully established in mice subjected to 10% O₂ hypoxia for 4 weeks and that there was no significant effect on systemic blood pressure.
Notably, METTL14 overexpression significantly exacerbated PAH.
The results of echocardiography revealed notable increases in RVEDD, RVEDV, RVESD, and RVESV in the hypoxia group, whereas RVESV, RVFS, RVEF, and PAAT significantly decreased.
The HypoxiaMETTL14group presented the most significant results (Supplementary Fig.1B and 1 C).
These findings indicate that mice with pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia, particularly those with METTL14 overexpression, exhibit obvious right ventricular dysfunction.
We subsequently evaluated the Fulton index, which is a crucial indicator of right ventricular hypertrophy resulting from increased right ventricular pressure and afterload.
Firstly, to determine whether METTL14 overexpression alone drives PH, we administered AAV9-METTL14 to normoxic mice.
No significant differences in the RV/(LV + S) ratio or PAMT were observed (Supplementary Fig.2).
As shown in Fig.2C, the RV/(LV + S) ratio in mice subjected to hypoxia was notably greater than that in the control group, particularly in the HypoxiaMETTL14group.
HE staining revealed notable thickening of the pulmonary artery wall in the hypoxia group, accompanied by considerable elevation in pulmonary artery relative media thickness (PAMT), particularly in the hypoxiaMETTL14group (Fig.2A).
Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed notable increases in the expression levels of cell proliferation markers (Fig.2B).
These findings indicate that hypoxia can induce pulmonary artery remodeling and right ventricular dysfunction in mice and that METTL14 overexpression significantly exacerbates these manifestations.
A comparison was subsequently conducted to determine the expression of METTL14 in each group.
Western blot analysis revealed that hypoxia markedly elevated METTL14 levels in SMCs (Fig.2B).
To further analyze the expression of m6A in each group, colorimetry was employed to detect the mRNA m6A expression levels of total RNA and poly A + RNA.
These data indicated that the expression level of m6A in the hypoxia group was significantly greater than that in the control group.
Among these groups, the hypoxiaMETTL14group presented the most significant results (Fig.2C, D).
In addition, dot blot analysis revealed the same results (Fig.2E).
These findings suggest that METTL14 facilitates m6A modification, contributing to pulmonary artery remodeling and the development of PAH.
We have found that SETD2 overexpression markedly enhanced the proliferation of PASMCs (Fig.3A-C).
Interestingly, western blot analysis revealed a notable increase in H3K36me3 expression in the SETD2 group compared with the ControlNullgroup (Fig.3C).
These data indicate that SETD2 may play a key role in the proliferation of PASMCs by regulating H3K36me3.
Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed.
ChIP‒qPCR analysis revealed significant upregulation of H3K36me3 in the PAH group, and the expression level of H3K36me3 was most significantly elevated in cells transfected with the SETD2 gene (Fig.3D).
These findings indicate that SETD2 regulate the expression of METTL14 through H3K36me3, thereby promoting the proliferation of PASMCs.
The m6A expression levels of total RNA and poly A + RNA were subsequently quantified via colorimetric assay.
The results demonstrated a notable increase in m6A expression levels in the PAH group relative to those in the control group, and the CSSETD2group presented the most significant results (Fig.3E, F).
Furthermore, dot blot analysis showed similar results (Fig.3G).
These findings indicate that SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 and METTL14-mediated m6A modifications are pivotal in the pathogenesis of PAH.
To further investigate the role of SETD2 in vascular remodeling in PAH, in vivo experiments were performed.
The results of right cardiac catheterization revealed that RVSP, mPAP and TPR were notably decreased and that RVCO was significantly increased in SMC-specific SETD2-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig.3A).
These findings suggest that silencing the SETD2 gene in SMC cells can effectively inhibit PAH.
Next, we analyzed the effects of SMC-specific SETD2 defects on right ventricular function in PAH model mice via echocardiography.
We have found that silencing the SETD2 gene in SMCs can significantly improve PAH-induced right ventricular dysfunction (Supplementary Fig.3B and 3 C).
Subsequently, we analyzed the effects of SETD2 knockout in SMCs on pulmonary pathological remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy via histological analysis.
As shown in Fig.4A, SETD2 gene silencing in SMCs significantly reduced the RV/(LV + S) ratio.
HE staining revealed that SMC-specific SETD2 deletion significantly reduced PAMT and pulmonary remodeling in mice.
Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of cell proliferation markers were markedly diminished in SETD2-deficient SMCs derived from model mice (Fig.4B).
These findings implies that the knockout of SETD2 in SMCs profoundly reverses the pathological remodeling of pulmonary arteries in PAH and notably improves right ventricular function.
Chronic hypoxia exposure resulted in a notable increase in METTL14 expression in the pulmonary arteries of SETD2fl/flHypoxiamice.
Conversely, knockout of the SETD2 gene in SMCs resulted in a reduction in pulmonary artery remodeling and a decrease in METTL14 expression (Fig.4C).
To investigate the involvement of SETD2 and METTL14-mediated m6A RNA modification in PAH, we measured total RNA m6A levels via dot blot and colorimetric methods and found that m6A expression was significantly reduced after knockout of the SETD2 gene in SMCs, which suggested that knockout of the SETD2 gene in SMCs reduce total RNA m6A in the PAH pulmonary artery through METTL14 (Fig.4D-F).
Kumari et al. [28].
also reported that SETD2 knockout downregulated global RNA m6A levels in gliomas.
In addition, western blot analysis revealed that silencing the SETD2 gene in SMCs reduced the protein levels of H3K36me3 and METTL14 in SMCs (Fig.4B).
These findings indicate that SETD2 knockout in SMCs results in a reduction in the expression of H3K36me3 and METTL14, which may contribute to the alleviation of PAH.
To explore the possible mechanism of PAH regulation by METTL14-mediated m6A, we collected pulmonary artery tissue samples for MeRIP sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) analysis and found that the knockdown of the SETD2 gene in SMCs in PAH can significantly reduce the mRNA levels of Piezo1, PNCA, VEGFR2, TGFR1, IFIT2 and U2AF1, especially Piezo1 (Supplementary Fig.4A-C).
To verify the MeRIP-Seq results, additional qPCR analysis demonstrated that Piezo1 expression was markedly elevated in the SETD2fl/flHypoxiagroup compared with the SETD2fl/fl.Normoxiagroup.
Nevertheless, knockout of the SETD2 gene in smooth muscle cells led to a notable reduction in Piezo1 mRNA m6A (Fig.5E).
Consequently, Piezo1 was identified as the primary effective downstream target.
Confocal immunofluorescence images revealed that Piezo1, which was notably elevated in PAH, was predominantly expressed in PASMCs.
A comparison of the SETD2fl/fl.Normoxiagroup with the SETD2fl/fl.Normoxiagroup revealed a significant increase in Piezo1 expression.
Upon knockout of the SETD2 gene, a notable decrease in Piezo1 expression was observed in smooth muscle cells (Supplementary Fig.4D).
The regulation of Piezo1 expression by SETD2 at the mRNA and protein level was subsequently examined.
Real-time qPCR (Supplementary Fig.4E) and Western blotting (Supplementary Fig.4F) revealed that Piezo1 expression was markedly elevated in the SETD2fl/flHypoxiagroup compared with the SETD2fl/flNormoxiagroup.
However, knockout of the SETD2 gene in smooth muscle cells led to a notable reduction in Piezo1 expression (Supplementary Fig.4F).
In conclusion, knockdown of the SETD2 gene in SMCs can significantly reduce Piezo1 mRNA m6A in PAH pulmonary arteries and ameliorate PAH.
To determine the function of Piezo1 in PAH, we infected hPASMCs with AAV-9-METTL14 and used null vectors as controls.
Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed a considerable increase in Piezo1 expression in hPASMCs transfected with METTL14 overexpression (Fig.5A, B).
To further investigate this finding, we employed the sequence-based m6A modification site predictor SRAMP (http://www.cuilab.cn/sramp) to predict potential m6A modification sites in Piezo1 mRNA.
This analysis revealed that the A base at position 1080 exhibited high confidence modification potential (Fig.5C).
Additionally, qPCR analysis revealed that the level of Piezo1 mRNA was markedly elevated in hPASMCs with the METTL14-overexpressing (Fig.5D).
Upon cessation of transcription with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D, the decay rate of Piezo1 mRNA in cells overexpressing METTL14 was significantly slowed (Fig.5E).
These findings suggest that METTL14-mediated methylation influences the stability of Piezo1 mRNA.
The Piezo1-WT luciferase reporter gene was subsequently constructed by fusing a portion of the coding sequence (CDS) of Piezo1 and the 1080 A base to the downstream region of the luciferase reporter gene.
This result demonstrated that METTL14 markedly enhanced the luciferase activity of Piezo1.
A Piezo1-Mutant-A1080C luciferase reporter gene was designed and constructed by substituting a specific adenosine in the m6A motif.
The resulting reporter gene was then used to generate a reporter, which demonstrated that METTL14 was unable to promote luciferase activity in the presence of a site 1080 mutation (Fig.5F).
Collectively, these results confirm that METTL14-mediated m6A modification of Piezo1 mRNA is essential for Piezo1 mRNA stability.
To further substantiate the involvement of Piezo1 in PAH, we conducted in vivo experiments.
The right cardiac catheter results revealed that RVMP, RVSP, mPAP and TPR were significantly decreased and that RVCO was significantly increased after Piezo1 gene-specific knockdown in PASMCs (Supplementary Fig.5A), which suggested that Piezo1 knockdown in SMCs could effectively alleviate PAH.
The results of the echocardiographic tests demonstrated that the reduction in Piezo1 in mouse PASMCs led to a notable decrease in RVEDD, RVEDV, RVESD, and RVESV, whereas RVFS, RVEF, and PAAT exhibited considerable increases (Supplementary Fig.5B and 5 C).
These findings suggest that PASMC-specific Piezo1 defects may significantly ameliorate right ventricular function in PAH.
To further evaluate the effects of Piezo1 on pulmonary artery pathological remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy, we evaluated the Fulton index histologically.
Our findings demonstrated that defects in SMC-specific Piezo1 significantly reduced the RV/(LV + S) ratio (Fig.6A).
Additionally, HE staining revealed that depletion of Piezo1 expression in SMCs markedly attenuated PAMT within pulmonary arteries, thereby ameliorating the pulmonary remodeling induced by METTL14 overexpression (Fig.6A).
Meanwhile, western blot analysis revealed a notable reduction in the expression of cell proliferation markers in PASMC-specific Piezo1-deficient (Fig.6B).
These findings indicate that the knockdown of the Piezo1 gene in SMCs can inhibit PASMC proliferation and ameliorate PAH.
Subsequently, the expression level of total mRNA m6A in each group was determined via colorimetry and dot blot.
The results demonstrated that the total m6A level in SMCs was significantly increased in METTL14 overexpression group (Fig.6C and E).
In conclusion, these findings indicate that METTL14 regulates Piezo1 expression through m6A modification and plays an important role in the pathological remodeling of PAH and pulmonary arteries.
To gain further analytical insight into the mechanism by which Piezo1 facilitates PASMC proliferation, we constructed a Piezo1-adeno-associated virus expression vector (AAV9-Piezo1), infected hPASMCs with this vector.
Compared with those in the ControlNullgroup, the activity and proliferative capacity of PASMCs in the PAH group were markedly elevated, particularly in the CSPiezo1group (Fig.7A, B).
Western blot analysis revealed notable increases in the expression levels of cell proliferation markers in the PAH group compared with those in the control group.
This increase was particularly pronounced in the CSPiezo1group (Fig.7C).
These findings suggest that Piezo1 overexpression markedly enhances the proliferation of PASMCs.
The mRNA m6A levels of total RNA and poly A + RNA were detected via colorimetry.
The results demonstrated a notable increase in m6A expression levels in the PAH group relative to those in the control group (Fig.7D, E).
The dot blot also revealed the same result (Fig.7F).
These findings suggest that m6A modification promotes PASMC proliferation by regulating Piezo1.
Piezo1 is a principal component of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs), enabling the detection of external stressors and promoting the influx of intracellular Ca²⁺ [29].
We subsequently investigated the intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, and Fluo-4 fluorescence revealed a notable increase in the intracellular Ca²⁺ levels in the PAH group compared with those in the control group (Fig.7G).
These data collectively indicate that m6A modification-mediated Piezo1 may facilitate PASMC proliferation by increasing Ca²⁺ influx.
In vivo experiments found that the overexpression of Piezo1 in PASMCs exacerbated PAH and reversed the effects of SMCs-specific SETD2 defects (Supplementary Fig.6A).
The results of the echocardiographic analysis revealed that the overexpression of SMC-specific Piezo1 induced significant increases in RVEDD, RVEDV, RVESD, and RVESV, accompanied by reductions in RVEF, RVFS, and PAAT, compared with those in the control group (Supplementary Fig.6B and 6 C).
These data suggested that the overexpression of Piezo1, which is specific to SMCs, effectively reversed the impact of SETD2 knockout and significantly exacerbated the degree of right ventricular dysfunction.
To further assess the impact of Piezo1 overexpression in SMCs on pulmonary artery pathological remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy, we evaluated cardiac function via the Fulton index.
As shown in Fig.9C, Piezo1 overexpression in SMCs markedly elevated the LV/(LV + S) ratio.
The subsequent histological analysis examined the impact of Piezo1 overexpression in SMCs on pulmonary arteries.
The pulmonary arteries of mice with specific Piezo1-overexpressing SMCs exhibited notable thickening, accompanied by a significant increase in PAMT (Fig.8A).
Western blotting also revealed that Piezo1 overexpression in SMCs resulted in a significant increase in the expression of cell proliferation markers (Fig.8B).
These findings suggest that the overexpression of Piezo1 may reverse the effect of SETD2 knockdown and promote pulmonary artery remodeling.
In addition, Fluo-4 fluorescence revealed a notable increase in Ca²⁺ levels in the PASMCs of Piezo1-overexpressing mice (Fig.8C).
These findings indicate that Piezo1 overexpression in smooth muscle cells facilitates Ca²⁺ influx and exacerbates pathological remodeling of pulmonary arteries.
The expression of Piezo1, SETD2, and H3K36me3 at the protein level was subsequently evaluated.
Western blotting revealed that knockout of the SETD2 gene in SMCs led to notable reductions in both Piezo1 and H3K36me3 levels (Fig.8B).
These findings suggest that SETD2 may regulate Piezo1 expression via H3K36me3.
Next, the RNA m6A levels in each group were analyzed via dot blotting and colorimetry.
The results demonstrated a significant decrease in the total m6A level in the pulmonary artery following knockout of the SMCs SETD2 gene (Fig.8D and F).
These findings suggest that knockout of the SETD2 gene in SMCs regulates Piezo1 expression by reducing m6A via METTL14.
Taken together, these results suggest that SETD2 mediates H3K36me3-mediated regulation of METTL14 m6A modification, which in turn mediates Piezo1 regulation of PAH progression.
Previous studies have shown that Piezo1 promotes small artery remodeling in hypertensive patients by increasing the intracellular Ca2+concentration and activating transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in smooth muscle cells [18,30].
To test the hypothesis that Ca²⁺ influx promotes the proliferation of PASMCs via TGM2, we constructed an adenovirus expressing Piezo1 (Ad-Piezo1) to infect hPASMCs and established a PAH model in vitro.
Western blot analysis revealed a notable increase in TGM2 protein expression in the PAH group, particularly in the CSPiezo1group (Supplementary Fig.7A).
Fluorescence staining demonstrated that TGM2 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of PASMCs (Supplementary Fig.7B).
In addition, TGM2 enzyme activity in PASMCs transfected with Piezo1 was significantly increased (Supplementary Fig.7C).
These findings indicate that Piezo1 overexpression facilitates PASMCs proliferation by stimulating TGM2 activity.
In vivo experiments were subsequently conducted for further verification.
TGM2 expression and enzyme activity were markedly lower in the SETD2−/−Hypoxiagroup than in the control group.
Notably, following Piezo1 transfection, TGM2 protein expression in PASMCs was markedly elevated, accompanied by a notable increase in TGM2 enzyme activity (Supplementary Fig.7D-7 F).
Furthermore, Piezo1-specific inhibitors (e.g., GsMTx4) abolished the effect of Piezo1 on the elevated TGM2 protein expression and activity.
(Supplementary Fig.7D-7 F).These findings indicate that SETD2 knockout in SMCs can suppress TGM2 expression, whereas Piezo1 overexpression can stimulate TGM2 expression by increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, thereby contributing to the development of PAH.
With continuous research on RNA modification, more than 170 chemical modifications have been found in RNA, among which N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is one of the most abundant mRNA modifications in eukaryotes [5,31].
m6A is a methylation modification of mRNA stop codon, 5’-UTR and adenylate 6th N in the long exon region, which can regulate RNA degradation, shear, transport, localization and translation, and play multiple regulatory effects in tissue development, tumorigenesis, stem cell differentiation and circadian rhythm transformation [32,33].
The m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC) is composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, where METTL3 and METTL14 can play a synergistic role in catalyzing the formation of m6A only after they are recruited to the nuclear speckle by WTAP [34].
METTL14 is critical in numerous biological processes.
The results of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that METT14 over-expression in SMCs elevated the level of m6A in PASMCs, stimulated the proliferation of PASMCs, exacerbated hypoxia-induced PAH and right ventricular dysfunction.
Histone lysine methylation (HKM) is the process by which S-adenosylmethionine methyl is transferred to lysine residues in the direction of lysine methyltransferase to form methylated derivatives [35].
H3K36me3 is an epigenetic mark associated with actively transcribed genes and is critical for several cellular processes including transcription elongation, DNA repair, and DNA methylation [36].
There is a correlation between HKM and m6A, with H3K36me3 directing the deposition of m6A by recruiting METTL14, and methylation of H3K36 recruiting the METTL3-METTL14 N6-adenosine methylation complex for m6A modification of newborn transcripts in the active chromatin region [36,37].
HKM is crucial in regulating PASMC proliferation, migration and contraction through epigenetic mechanisms.
SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) is a key histone lysine methyltransferase consisting of AWS-SET-PostSET, WW and SRI domains that catalytically generates H3K36me3 with H3K36me2 as substrate.
It exerts potent tumor inhibitory effects by regulating RNA cleavage, DNA methylation, chromosome segregation and DNA damage repair [36,38].
Studies have shown that 69.2% of m6A peaks overlap with H3K36me3 modification sites in the mRNA stop codon region.
The co-transcriptional catalytic activity of SETD2 is required to restore the levels of H3K36me3 and m6A, and deletion of SETD2 results in hypomethylation of H3K36me3 and m6A [9].
The absence of SETD2 may lead to oocyte maturation defects and single cell arrest after fertilization, resulting in embryonic abortion [39].
We found that HKM plays an important regulatory role in PAH, and SMCS-specific SETD2 deletion inhibits mRNA m6A methylation by down regulating METTL14 levels through H3K36me3, reverses hypoxia-induced pulmonary artery remodeling, significantly alleviates PAH, and improves right ventricular dysfunction caused by PAH.
This suggests that SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 and METTL14-mediated m6A play important roles in the pathogenesis of PAH.
Shear stress is an important mechanical factor in vascular constriction and remodeling [40].
Piezo1 was discovered to be a mechanosensitive, non-selective cation ion channel protein that senses and transmits a variety of mechanological forces, such as cell membrane tension, cellular stretch, shear stress, and cyclic pressure [18].
It plays an important role in the early development of blood vessels, and has been demonstrated to promote the formation of new blood vessels by activating the MT1-MMP signaling pathway [41].
Recently, Piezo1 was found to promote pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability after mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [42].
Furthermore, Piezo1 has been shown to exert a positive regulatory effect in PAH by modulating cellular behaviour through shear stress and piezoelectric sensing, thereby promoting cell proliferation, migration and aggregation, which in turn leads to pathological vascular remodeling [43,44].
An elevation in the concentration of free Ca²⁺ within the cytoplasm of PASMCs is the primary mechanism underlying pulmonary vascular constriction.
Concurrently, a disturbance in cellular Ca²⁺ balance stimulates the proliferation of PASMCs, resulting in pulmonary artery remodelling and the advancement of PAH [45].
Piezo1, a core member of the stretch-activated ion channels (SACs), is capable of sensing external pressure and promoting the osmotic influx of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+plasma, with a particular ability to facilitate Ca2+influx [17,46].
In physiologic states, pulmonary endothelial cell Piezo1 regulates pulmonary vasodilation via mediation of inward Ca²⁺ flow [47].
Fernandeds et al. [48] demonstrated that Piezo1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx promotes contraction and abnormal proliferation of PASMCs.
Furthermore, Yoda1-mediated Ca²⁺ flow through the Piezo1 channel stimulates PASMCs proliferation [49].
In this study, we found that SETD2 and METTL14 affect the development of PAH by regulating the expression of Piezo1.
The use of MeRIP-qPCR, RNA stability analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that METTL14 enhanced Piezo1 expression in an m6A-dependent manner.
In comparison to the control group, METTL14 overexpression resulted in the upregulation of Piezo1 in PASMCs, increased Ca²⁺ influx, induced PASMCs excessive proliferation and pulmonary artery remodelling, and accelerated PAH progression and right ventricular dysfunction.
Knockout of the SETD2 gene in SMCs can significantly reduce Piezo1 mRNA m6A in PAH pulmonary arteries and improve PAH.
Previous studies have shown that Piezo1 activation induces Ca2+influx and activates transglutaminase2 (TGM2), leading to lens sclerosis [50].
Retailleau et al. [30] showed that Piezo1 activates TGM2 to induce arteriolar angiogenesis in arterial smooth muscle cells.
Our study revealed that Piezo1 and TGM2 are predominantly expressed in PASMCs, and that Piezo1 exerts a crucial regulatory role in PAH by enhancing Ca²⁺ influx, activating TGM2, and promoting PASMCs proliferation.
In addition, Mertens et al. [51] found that ADORA2B on PASMC promotes PAH by inducing the expression of IL-6, hyaluronic acid and TGM2.
Taken together, these findings indicate that TGM2 plays a critical role in the development of PAH.
Our study indicated that SETD2 gene knockout in SMCs could reduce m6A levels of H3K36me3, METTL14, and Piezo1 mRNA.
This results in the down-regulation of TGM2, which reverses the malignant remodeling of pulmonary arteriolar arteries and alleviates PAH, thereby improving right heart function.
Nevertheless, when the SETD2 gene is overexpressed in smooth muscle cells, the opposite effect is observed.
In short, by combining epigenetic modification and shear stress for the first time, we found that SETD2 drives METTL14-mediated m6A to inhibit Piezo1 attenuation and activate TGM2 to induce PAH, providing new insights and potential avenues for prevention and treatment of PAH.
While our study provides novel insights into the SETD2/METTL14-Piezo1-TGM2 axis in PAH, several limitations warrant consideration.
First, the hypoxia-induced PAH model, though widely utilized, may not fully recapitulate the heterogeneity of human PAH, which includes heritable, idiopathic, and inflammation-associated subtypes.
Validation in alternative preclinical models and human PAH tissues is critical to confirm translational relevance.
Second, while we identified METTL14-mediated m6A regulation of Piezo1 mRNA stability, the specific m6A sites on Piezo1 and the reader proteins (e.g., YTHDF1/2) responsible for its decay remain uncharacterized.
Third, our focus on PASMCs excludes potential contributions from endothelial cells or fibroblasts, which are central to PAH pathogenesis.
Finally, while AAV9 enabled PASMC-focused METTL14 modulation in this study, emerging serotypes (e.g., AAV6.2FF) with enhanced lung SMC specificity may further improve targeting precision in future investigations.
Addressing these gaps will refine therapeutic targeting of this axis in diverse PAH subtypes.
The present study revealed that SETD2 recruits METTL14 to mRNA m6A via METTL14 methylation, thereby activating Piezo1, increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and enhancing TGM2 expression (Fig.9).
This study revealed that SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 drives METTL14-mediated m6A modification, inhibits Piezo1 mRNA attenuation, activates TGM2 to induce PAH, and provides a new intervention target for the treatment of PAH.
