Depression is a leading global cause of disability.
Emerging evidence highlights glutamatergic dysfunction, particularly impaired NMDA receptor signaling, as a key contributor to its neurobiology.
Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), once regarded solely as toxic, is now recognized for its role in regulating synaptic plasticity, inflammation, and neuronal survival.
This review synthesizes recent findings on the antidepressant effects of H₂S.
In animal models, H₂S administration improves depression-like behaviors while modulating key pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Sirt1, and the cGAS–STING pathway.
These benefits extend across models of stress, neuropathic pain, diabetes, and sleep deprivation.
Among H₂S donors, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) demonstrated the most consistent antidepressant effects in preclinical studies.
Clinical studies further show that individuals with major depression exhibit lower plasma H₂S levels, with symptom severity inversely correlated to H₂S concentration.
Together, these findings support a multifaceted role for H₂S in mood regulation and highlight its promise as both a therapeutic candidate and a potential biomarker in depressive disorders, though translational studies remain needed.
Depression is a common and disabling mood disorder characterized by persistent low mood, emotional distress, and functional impairment.
It poses significant risks to life if not properly addressed.
While its neurobiology remains incompletely understood, growing evidence implicates dysfunction within the glutamatergic system, specifically involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling (Hashimoto,2011).
This has led to increased interest in developing novel glutamate-modulating therapies that extend beyond the traditional monoaminergic framework (Murrough et al.,2017).
NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels that facilitate calcium influx and play a key role in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS).
Disruption of this mechanism may significantly contribute to the neurobiological alterations observed in depressive disorders.
Supporting this, studies have reported altered NMDA receptor gene expression and function in the hippocampus of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Amidfar et al.,2019).
Postmortem analyses have revealed reduced levels of NMDA receptor subunits 1 and 2A in the brains of suicide victims (Nowak et al.,1995).
Chronic stress in animal models also downregulates NMDA receptor expression, particularly in the hippocampus (Pacheco et al.,2017).
Recently, attention has shifted to endogenous gaseous signaling molecules (gasotransmitters) as modulators of neural function in depression.
Among them, hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) has emerged as a particularly promising candidate.
It modulates NMDA receptor activity and influences synaptic plasticity (Shefa et al.,2018), suggesting a potential role in mood regulation.
In addition, H₂S has been implicated in influencing both the persistence and magnitude of synaptic modifications, especially in processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (He et al.,2017).
Given these properties, H₂S is now being investigated as both a neuromodulator and a potential therapeutic agent for depression and anxiety.
This review synthesizes the most recent evidence on the antidepressant effects of H₂S, with focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms.
By integrating a systematic review of preclinical studies with emerging clinical data, we assess the therapeutic potential of exogenous H₂S administration in affective disorders and explore its viability as a novel target for future antidepressant strategies.
H₂S is a colorless, flammable, highly water-soluble gas with a distinct odor of rotten eggs, detectable even at very low atmospheric concentrations (as low as 0.0007 mg/m3).
It was first identified by Swedish chemist Carl W. Scheele in 1777 and occurs naturally through the decomposition of organic matter, volcanic emissions, and as a component of natural gas.
The toxic effects of H₂S were documented earlier, in 1713, by Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini.
However, its endogenous presence in the brain was not discovered until 1989, and six years later, it was demonstrated to act as a signaling molecule capable of modulating neurotransmission (Kimura,2021).
H₂S is synthesized in neurons and astrocytes via the activity of three key enzymes: Cytosolic cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), which functions in conjunction with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT).
CBS shows its highest enzymatic activity in glial cells of the hippocampus and cerebellum; CSE is predominantly expressed in spinal cord microglia and cerebellar granule neurons; and 3MST is widely distributed in neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain (Kolluru et al.,2013).
CBS and CSE catalyze the conversion of L-cysteine and L-homocysteine into cystathionine, leading to H₂S generation (Tanizawa,2011).
Additionally, CBS can produce H₂S through a β-substitution reaction, wherein cysteine condenses with homocysteine (Chen et al.,2004).
CSE, in contrast, degrades L-cystine via a β-elimination reaction, yielding pyruvate, ammonia, and thiocysteine, which subsequently reacts with L-cysteine (or other thiols) to produce H₂S.
The 3MST pathway involves CAT-mediated transamination of L-cysteine and α-ketoglutarate, producing 3-mercaptopyruvate and L-glutamate; 3MST then transfers sulfur from 3-mercaptopyruvate to sulfuric acid, yielding pyruvate and thiosulfate, which is ultimately reduced to H₂S (Tanizawa,2011).
The complete biosynthesis pathway of H₂S in the brain is illustrated in Fig.1.
H₂S plays a pivotal role in modulating synaptic function and neuroplasticity through its interactions with NMDA receptors and calcium signaling.
It influences calcium dynamics within astrocytes at tripartite synapses by reducing the release of glutamate and calcium ions, thereby providing a neuroprotective buffer against excitotoxicity.
H₂S can also directly stimulate NMDA receptors, enhancing the induction of LTP.
This facilitation of LTP is partially mediated through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which regulates the activity of CBS, an enzyme essential for H₂S synthesis and its interaction with NMDA receptors.
Moreover, H₂S prompts calcium influx into astrocytes via activation of TRPA1 ion channels, which leads to the release of D-serine, a co-agonist at NMDA receptors.
The resulting increase in NMDA receptor activity further enhances LTP induction.
Genetic studies support this mechanism showing that that reduced CBS expression impairs LTP, highlighting the critical role of H₂S in synaptic plasticity (Kimura,2020).
In addition, astrocyte-derived H₂S may modulate neuronal signaling by activating adenylyl cyclase (AC) in adjacent neurons, enhancing NMDA receptor activity via the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway.
H₂S also contributes to intracellular calcium mobilization by promoting release from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and stimulating excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which increases synaptic glutamate availability (Pałasz et al.,2021).
This mini-review aimed to qualitatively summarize evidence from preclinical and clinical studies to address the research question:Does exogenous administration of H₂S exhibit antidepressant properties?Additionally, we sought to describe the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.
A systematic search of the PubMed database was conducted, covering the period from January 2021 to July 24, 2025 (final search date).
The following keyword combination was used: (depression OR “depressive disorder” OR “major depressive disorder” OR “mood disorder”) AND (“hydrogen sulfide” OR “H₂S”).
Initial screening was performed by a single reviewer who first assessed article titles, excluding those clearly irrelevant (e.g., plant studies).
Abstracts were then screened to confirm inclusion of the term “H₂S” or the name of a known H₂S donor.
Full-text articles were reviewed and included if deemed relevant to the research question.
To maintain conciseness and focus on the latest evidence, only original research articles published in English from 2021 onward were included.
Review articles, non-English publications, and studies not related to effect of H₂S on depression were excluded.
The detailed inclusion and exclusion process is summarized in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig.2).
The primary reasons for exclusion included irrelevant topics, such as studies on respiratory depression instead of mood-related depressive disorders, non-biomedical articles, or those focused solely on H₂S detection rather than its exogenous administration in the context of depression.
Study quality and risk of bias were assessed qualitatively.
For each included study, we considered factors such as experimental design, sample size, inclusion of appropriate control groups, outcome measurement methods, use of any additional medications that might have influenced results, and completeness of data reporting.
Studies were discussed with attention to these methodological features, and any potential limitations, confounding factors, or sources of bias were noted in the discussion section and in the comparative summary Table1.
Animal studies have provided robust evidence for the antidepressant-like effects of H₂S.
In a rodent model of poststroke depression (PSD), sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) a donor of H2S, reduced depression-like behaviors and suppressed microglial inflammation by inhibiting the cGAS–STING pathway and promoting endoplasmic reticulum autophagy, supporting the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role of H₂S in PSD (Luo et al.,2025).
Recently, in a corticosteroid-induced rat model of anxiety and depression, administration of H₂S via NaHS produced robust antidepressant and anxiolytic effects that exceeded those observed with sertraline.
H₂S treatment reversed both behavioral impairments and molecular disruptions associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, restoring antioxidant defenses (GSH, NRF2), neurotrophic support (BDNF, serotonin), and inflammatory and apoptotic balance (TNF-α, IL-1β, BAX/BCL2).
These effects were mechanistically attributed to modulation of the endoplasmic reticulum GRP78/PERK and nuclear CHOP/ATF4/GADD34 signaling pathways (Azzam et al.,2025).
Similarly, in a PTSD model using inescapable foot shock, exogenous H₂S administration alleviated depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in adolescent mice.
This improvement was associated with enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and activation of the CREB/BDNF signaling cascade (Gu et al.,2025).
Beyond its well-established anti-inflammatory effects, suggested also in inflammatory bowel disease models (Ma et al.,2025), H₂S exhibits antidepressant properties through modulation of autophagy and synaptic plasticity.
In rodent models of chronic stress, administration of NaHS improved depression- and anxiety-like behaviors via activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
This activation suppressed excessive neuronal autophagy, restored the expression of key synaptic proteins, and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis.
Notably, these effects were abolished by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, confirming the pathway’s critical role in mediating H₂S-induced neuroprotection (Ling et al.,2025).
These findings reinforce the involvement of the PI3K/AKT pathway, consistent with evidence from diabetic models, where H₂S similarly improved depression- and anxiety-like behaviors by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis (Jiang et al.,2021).
Other studies have identified additional molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of H₂S in models of diabetes and inflammation, including the reduction of ferroptosis and neuroinflammation, modulation of Sirt6 signaling (Wang et al.,2021), and inhibition of the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome, along with the preservation of mitochondrial function in the hippocampus (Bao et al.,2023).
Recent studies have further expanded the antidepressant potential of H₂S to neurodegenerative and aging-related models.
In Parkinson’s disease and β₂-microglobulin-induced models of aging-associated depression, NaHS alleviated depression-like behaviors by enhancing the Warburg effect in the hippocampus.
These metabolic improvements were associated with enhanced synaptic plasticity, including upregulation of synaptic proteins and normalization of ultrastructural parameters.
This suggests that modulation of neuronal energy metabolism is a key mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of H₂S (Liu et al.,2024; Yang et al.,2022).
Collectively, these findings highlight the multifaceted mechanisms through which H₂S might modulate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and plasticity in the pathophysiology of depression.
Beyond conventional depression models, H₂S has shown therapeutic efficacy in treating depression comorbid with chronic pain and sleep disturbances.
In a mouse model of neuropathic pain, NaHS administration alleviated both nociceptive and depression-like behaviors by reducing glutamate accumulation, suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability, and restoring astrocytic EAAT2 expression in the spinal cord (Qi et al.,2025).
These results highlight the potential of H₂S as a therapeutic strategy for individuals experiencing depression secondary to chronic pain.
Similar baseline anxiolytic and analgesic properties have been reported using other gasotransmitter donors (Baskin et al.,2022).
Alternative H₂S donors such as diallyl disulfide (DADS) and morpholin-4-ium 4-methoxyphenyl(morpholino) phosphinodithioate (GYY4137) have shown comparable effects in neuropathic pain models, reducing pain and mood disturbances by modulating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in brain regions involved in emotional regulation (Bai et al.,2021; Batallé et al.,2021; Roch et al.,2022).
Notably, combining the same H₂S donors with a cannabinoid 2 receptor agonist produced synergistic analgesic and antidepressant effects, associated with normalization of inflammatory (p-IKBα), neurotrophic (BDNF), and antioxidant (Nrf2/HO-1) markers in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray, although no significant differences were reported with the use of GYY4137 alone (Bai et al.,2023).
Collectively, these findings suggest that H₂S interacts with multiple neuromodulatory systems, including opioidergic and endocannabinoid pathways, to regulate pain-induced affective disturbances.
In addition to pain, sleep deprivation (SD), a known trigger for depressive symptoms, has also been explored in H₂S-related research.
In SD-exposed rats, NaHS administration alleviated depression and anxiety symptoms, reduced hippocampal inflammation, and upregulated the expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a neuroprotective deacetylase.
Inhibition of Sirt1 abolished these beneficial effects, confirming its role in mediating the antidepressant action of H₂S (Kang et al.,2021).
Similar observations were made in chronic restraint stress models, where Sirt1 inhibition again reversed the behavioral benefits of H₂S treatment (Du et al.,2023).
Taken together, the main findings and key details of the studies included in our review are summarized and compared in Table1.
The molecular mechanisms outlined above are synthesized in Fig.3.
This integrated schematic illustrates the principal molecular pathways through which H₂S exerts its antidepressant effects, highlighting its role in modulating neuroinflammation, autophagy, synaptic plasticity, redox balance, and energy metabolism across neuronal, glial, and immune cell populations.
H₂S is emerging as a key neuromodulator with the potential to transform how we understand and treat depression.
Its influence extends across several neurobiological domains: It modulates NMDA receptor signaling, regulates calcium homeostasis, enhances synaptic plasticity, and suppresses neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis, all of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.
Beyond its therapeutic potential, circulating H₂S levels may also reflect depressive severity, making it a promising biomarker in clinical psychiatry.
The current body of literature on the antidepressant effects of H₂S, though still limited to preclinical studies, consistently identifies H₂S donors as promising therapeutic agents for treating depression.
Nonetheless, discrepancies among findings remain.
While most studies report a reduction in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in adult mice or rats, a recent study by Gu et al. (Gu et al.,2025) observed these effects exclusively in adolescent mice.
However, adult animals showed a more pronounced decrease in endogenous H₂S levels, which was closely associated with anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.
NaHS is the most commonly used H₂S donor across these studies, though alternative donors such as DADS and GYY4137 have also been employed.
Despite yielding comparable antidepressant outcomes, caution is warranted when interpreting these findings.
Differences in the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics, particularly the rate and mode of H₂S release, may account for variability in outcomes.
Moreover, studies involving DADS and GYY4137 primarily assessed their effects in pain models, where antidepressant-like behaviors were evaluated in the context of pain-induced depression.
This overlap complicates the interpretation of whether the observed behavioral effects reflect true antidepressant activity or are secondary to analgesic effects.
For instance, Bai et al. (Bai et al.,2023) reported both analgesic and antidepressant effects of GYY4137 only when it was co-administered with a cannabinoid 2 receptor agonist; when administered alone, the compound failed to produce such effects, raising questions about its intrinsic antidepressant properties.
For these reasons, to date, the most consistent results come from the use of NaHS, rather than DADS and GYY4137, whose effects might be influenced by their analgesic properties and might be more suitable, once further confirmed, for treating depression in chronic pain conditions rather than major depressive disorder.
Although most preclinical studies included in this review reported statistically significant results with sample sizes of 8–15 mice per group, these numbers, while standard in animal research, are generally considered small.
This may limit the generalizability and reliability of findings when translating to clinical populations.
Additionally, publication bias cannot be excluded, as studies with negative or inconclusive findings are less likely to be published, potentially leading to an overrepresentation of positive outcomes in the literature.
Together, these factors may contribute to an overestimation of the efficacy of H₂S donors in preclinical models.
Future studies with larger, independent cohorts and transparent reporting, including negative results, are needed to better define the translational potential of these findings.
Human research remains limited, but early clinical studies suggest a correlation between reduced plasma H₂S levels and the presence and severity of depression.
In a study comparing individuals with depression to healthy controls, plasma H₂S levels were found to be markedly reduced among those with depressive symptoms, with the lowest levels observed in patients experiencing more severe forms of the disorder.
Furthermore, statistical analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between plasma H₂S concentrations and depression severity, suggesting that diminished H₂S may both reflect and contribute to the neurobiological changes underlying depressive states (Yang et al.,2021).
These findings were later confirmed in a study involving 41 patients with depression (Dutta et al.,2024), and similarly in 45 patients with bipolar disorder during the depressive phase, both showing significantly lower H₂S levels compared to controls (Lv et al.,2024).
Although these results suggest that H₂S may serve as a biomarker for depression, it remains unclear whether this is causative or simply reflective of downstream pathophysiology.
Larger, longitudinal studies are required to assess variability, specificity, and predictive value.
Significant challenges remain before pre-clinical insights can be translated into clinical practice.
The long-term effects of chronic H₂S donor administration remain unexplored, particularly in treatment-resistant or recurrent forms of depression.
In addition, the question of whether combining H₂S-based approaches with conventional monoaminergic antidepressants might produce additive or synergistic effects remains unresolved; such combinations might potentially improve outcomes where single-agent therapy falls short.
Another important direction is exploring how genetic differences in the expression or function of H₂S-synthesizing enzymes, particularly CBS, CSE, and 3MST, might influence individual susceptibility or treatment response.
These inter-individual differences could help identify which patients are most likely to benefit from H₂S-targeted interventions.
However, without a clearly defined biomarker threshold for what constitutes ‘healthy’ H₂S levels, such personalized strategies remain speculative and potentially inconsistent in clinical settings (Al-Owais et al.,2023).
A key shortcoming in current research on H₂S in animal models of depression is the frequent absence of direct H₂S quantification.
Many reported studies rely on the administration of H₂S donors but typically do not assess endogenous H₂S levels before or after treatment.
This omission creates a critical gap in understanding the specific concentrations of H₂S necessary to elicit antidepressant effects.
Although several detection strategies exist, current fluorescent probe methods still face limitations in specificity, stability, and quantification accuracy.
Probes often lack the specificity needed to distinguish H₂S from other similar compounds, which may produce misleading signals, and their stability often declines in complex biological environments.
Although deep tissue imaging remains difficult, advances in probe design and the integration of fluorescence with mass spectrometry offer promising solutions (Pandey & Pandey,2025).
Similar limitations are present in human studies, where issues of sensitivity, specificity, and sample degradation persist.
Moreover, the detection techniques employed in the clinical studies we reported, measure H₂S levels only in plasma, which may not accurately reflect concentrations within the brain, adding further uncertainty to the clinical interpretation.
Clinical studies on H₂S donors remain limited, with only a few compounds tested in humans and most safety data restricted to short-term administration in non-psychiatric indications.
For example, SG1002, a synthetic sodium polysulfide/polythionate donor, was evaluated in a placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase I clinical trial in healthy subjects and patients with heart failure, and was well tolerated for up to one week, with only mild or moderate adverse events and no significant laboratory or vital sign abnormalities (Polhemus et al.,2015; Zheng et al.,2018).
Fast-releasing inorganic sulfide salts, such as NaHS and Na₂S, can cause rapid spikes in H₂S levels and acute hypotension, making bolus injection unsuitable and highlighting the need for safer, controlled-release formulations (Caliendo et al.,2010; Zheng et al.,2018).
To address these concerns, slow-releasing and hybrid H₂S donors have been developed.
NSAID–H₂S hybrids, such as ATB-346, have completed phase 2B clinical trials for osteoarthritis, where it demonstrated improved gastrointestinal safety compared to traditional NSAIDs (Wallace et al.,2020).
However, this agent has not been evaluated in neuropsychiatric indications.
Another example is ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM), a water-soluble, slow-releasing, and pH-dependent H₂S donor with proven cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects in animal models.
ATTM’s clinical use and safety have been primarily evaluated as a copper chelator in cancer and cardioprotection trials (Chan et al.,2017), but its role and safety profile as an H₂S donor in humans remain to be clarified.
No clinical safety data are available for other slow-release donors, including GYY4137 and the garlic-derived DADS and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), as these have only been evaluated in preclinical studies and not in clinical trials.
To date, there are no registered clinical trials evaluating exogenous hydrogen sulfide donors as therapeutic agents for depression or other neuropsychiatric disorders.
Existing clinical studies have primarily focused on cardiovascular or gastrointestinal indications and have not addressed psychiatric outcomes.
The narrow therapeutic window of H₂S and limited methods for real-time monitoring further complicate translation to clinical use.
Hence, despite promising animal data, successful translation will require H₂S donors that are safe, brain-penetrant, and capable of sustained release at physiologically relevant concentrations.
Considering these barriers, a realistic timeline for clinical application likely spans at least 10 to 15 years.
Progress will depend on the development of validated quantification tools, safe slow-release formulations, and well-designed clinical trials to establish efficacy and optimal dosing.
These steps are essential to move from proof-of-concept to approved treatments.
Currently, several strategies may naturally enhance the endogenous autopoiesis of H₂S.
These include supplementation with the H₂S precursor L-cysteine (Jain et al.,2024), the consumption of sulfur-rich foods (Rose et al.,2021), and the use of probiotics or prebiotic fibers, which by supporting a balanced microbiome, may promote the activity of bacteria capable of sulfate reduction, thereby increasing H₂S production (Munteanu et al.,2024).
