In this work, we proposed a multiband dual‐VENC 2D PC‐MRI technique termed MB‐DV PC‐MRI to simultaneously measure arterial pulsatility across multiple cerebral arterial segments, including both proximal greater and distal smaller arteries.
A multiband SINC RF pulse was designed to simultaneously excite multiple slices with varied gaps between adjacent slices in MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
A retrospectively gated MB‐DV PC‐MRI sequence was performed on 11 young (29.9 ± 7.3 years) and nine elderly (68.3 ± 11.1 years) to measure pulsatility indices (PIs) of multiple cerebral arterial segments.
A test–retest study and a comparison study with conventional single‐band 2D PC‐MRI demonstrated MB‐DV PC‐MRI provides good reproducibility and reliability in cerebral PI measurements.
Additionally, the damping factor (DF) was calculated as the ratio of PIs between proximal and distal vessel segments, showing good reproducibility.
Compared to younger adults, elderly adults exhibited overall higher PI values across cerebral arterial segments and varied damping along ICA‐MCA.
This study demonstrates that MB‐DV PC‐MRI is a reliable technique for the assessment of arterial pulsatility along the cerebrovascular tree, which could be a useful imaging tool in studying the role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
A multiband dual‐VENC 2D PC‐MRI (MB‐DV PC‐MRI) technique is proposed to simultaneously measure pulsatility index (PI) at multiple cerebral arterial segments within a single short scan.
The MB‐DV PC‐MRI demonstrates good reliability in PI measurements as well as damping factor (DF) along the cerebrovascular tree.
Arterial pulsatility is an established indicator of cardiovascular health that characterizes arterial flow pulsations due to the heartbeat, reflecting both local arterial stiffness and downstream vascular impedance.
Increased arterial pulsatility causes the transmission of excessive pulsatile energy into downstream arteries, inducing the dysfunction of microcirculation, which can result in vascular brain injuries, such as white matter lesions and enlarged perivascular spaces [1,2,3], and subsequently lead to cognitive deficits.
Therefore, arterial pulsatility has emerged as a sensitive marker of cognitive impairment and dementia [2,4].
Growing evidence indicates that directly assessing cerebral arterial pulsatility could provide better insight into cerebrovascular pathology [5,6,7] in Alzheimer's disease and small vessel disease.
Comprehensively assessing cerebral arterial pulsatility along the cerebrovascular tree could help further elucidate the mechanisms of cerebrovascular pathologies.
Arterial pulsatility is quantified by the pulsatility index (PI), which is calculated as the difference between the peak systolic and minimum diastolic flow velocities divided by the mean velocity throughout the cardiac cycle.
Cerebral arterial pulsatility is traditionally measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography [8] and phase‐contrast MRI (PC‐MRI) [9].
TCD measures blood flow velocities and PIs of larger intracranial arteries, for example, the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
However, TCD is operator‐dependent and relies on the availability of acoustic windows through the skull [10], and it is challenging to detect distal cerebral arteries with TCD.
PC‐MRI has recently become a useful imaging tool to directly quantitatively measure arterial blood velocities across the cardiac cycle by utilizing a bipolar gradient to encode velocity through flow‐induced phase shift along the gradient direction [11].
Cardiac gated time‐resolved 2D PC‐MRI has been successfully applied to measure arterial blood flow velocities over a cardiac cycle to measure the PI of the internal carotid artery (ICA), vertebral artery (VA), and the major branches of the circle of Willis by placing the imaging plane perpendicular to the imaged vessel.
Studies have reported that PIs measured by 2D PC‐MRI are linked to hypoperfusion and cognitive impairment [5,6,9,12].
However, to assess cerebral arterial pulsatility across different segments of the cerebral vasculature, multiple separate 2D PC‐MRI scans are required to cover different vessel segments or levels [13].
4D flow [14], a time‐resolved 3D PC‐MRI technique, provides volumetric image acquisition, allowing for the assessment of cerebral arterial pulsatility from multiple segments in a single scan [15,16].
However, given the tradeoff between scan time and spatial resolution, 4D flow studies have primarily assessed PIs of the major branches of the circle of Willis as well as the ICA and VA.
Given the limitations of both conventional 2D PC‐MRI and 4D flow for assessing cerebral arterial pulsatility, this study is aimed at developing a time‐efficient, high‐resolution multiband dual‐VENC 2D PC‐MRI (MB‐DV PC‐MRI) technique to simultaneously assess cerebral arterial pulsatility across multiple brain vessel segments within a single short scan.
Compared to single‐VENC, dual‐VENC can enhance the velocity‐to‐noise (VNR) ratio defined as the ratio of measured velocity to the standard deviation of the velocity [17,18] and thus improve the accuracy of velocity measurements across a wide velocity range, which is suitable for cerebral velocity measurements across vessel segments.
The feasibility of PI measurements by MB‐DV PC‐MRI was evaluated by simulation and comparison with conventional single‐band 2D PC‐MRI.
A test–retest study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of PI measurements using MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
Additionally, the damping factor (DF), another useful index of vascular dysfunction, can be derived as the ratio of PI measurements between proximal and distal vessels, which reflects the damping of pulsatile energy down the arterial tree [19].
The sensitivity of MB‐DV PC‐MRI in detecting aging effects on both cerebral PI and DF was investigated.
This study was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board.
A total of 13 younger (age: 34.08 ± 10.86 years) and nine elderly (age: 68.3 ± 11.1 years) volunteers participated in this study after providing written informed consent.
All experiments were performed on a 3T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) system using a 64‐channel head coil.
whereNrepresents the number of slices simultaneously excited or multiband factor, and∆ωnandφnare the frequency offset and the additional phase of slicen, respectively.
Different from conventional multiband RF implementation,∆ωvaried across slices depending on each slice position.
Figure1aillustrates the positions of four simultaneously excited slices by MB‐DV PC‐MRI on a low‐resolution time‐of‐flight (TOF) to cover ICA C1 and VA V3 (Slice 1), ICA C2 and VA V4 (Slice 2), MCA M2/3 and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) A2/3 (Slice 3), and MCA M4, ACA A4, and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) P4 (Slice 4).
CAIPIRINHA was applied to control and modify the aliasing patterns by adding additional phaseφnto the multiband RF pulses to shift individual slices by FOV/N [20].
Bandwidth time product was set to 3.26, and the duration of MB RF pulse was 2000 μs.
A reference scan of each individual slice was acquired using a single‐band 2D PC‐MRI with matched imaging parameters without cardiac‐gating.
The reference scans were used to generate the coil sensitivity maps [21] for the MB‐DV PC‐MRI image reconstruction with SENSE [22].
Twenty phases across a cardiac cycle were finally reconstructed through thek‐space interpolation across a cardiac cycle.

(c) Offline reconstructed separated MB‐DV PC‐MRI images of the four slices.
The imaged arterial segments are labeled in each slice (MIP, maximum intensity projection).
In the proposed MB‐DV PC‐MRI, a single through‐plane velocity direction was applied.
To investigate the potential effects of vessel tilting on the PI measurement, a numerical simulation study was performed.
An in vivo flow velocity curve at ICA over a cardiac cycle was used as the velocity template in the following simulation.
The flow velocities in a blood vessel with different diameters from 0.75 to 3 mm were simulated with an in‐plane spatial resolution of 0.4 × 0.4 mm2.
When the vessel is perpendicular to the imaging slice, the cross‐sectional velocities follow a laminar flow distribution.
A series of cross‐sectional velocity images across the cardiac cycle were generated at each 𝜃. Gaussian noise was added to the velocity images.
The PI was calculated from the extracted cross‐sectional velocity curve and compared with the original PI.
Additionally, conventional single‐slice 2D PC‐MRI was performed on two participants to image M2/3 and M4 for in vivo PI comparison between 1D and 3D velocity encoding.
The sequence parameters were as follows: FOV = 180 × 180 mm2, voxel size = 0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm3, TE = 8.98 ms, real temporal resolution = 71.85 ms, flip angle = 60°, dual‐VENC of 40 and 80 cm/s in thezdirection and 80 cm/s for the other two directions, and bandwidth = 200 Hz/pixel.
A whole‐brain low‐resolution 3D TOF scan was performed to locate intracranial arteries using the following parameters: FOV = 181 × 200 × 172 mm3, voxel size = 0.4 × 0.4 × 1 mm3, TR = 21 ms, TE = 3.5 ms, flip angle = 18°, and acquisition time = 6 min.
Retrospectively gated MB‐DV PC‐MRI sequence was performed on nine young participants using a pulse oximeter (two female, 29.4 ± 7.8 years).
The MB‐DV PC‐MRI sequence consisted of a flow‐compensated reference scan and two through‐plane flow‐encoded scans perk‐space line with VENCs of 40 and 80 cm/s, respectively.
The other imaging parameters included the following: FOV = 200 × 200 mm2, voxel size = 0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm3, multiband factor = 4, TE/TR = 9.54/88.26 ms, flip angle = 60°, bandwidth = 202 Hz/pixel, number of phases = 20, and acquisition time ~3 min 30 s depending on the heart rate.
The additional reference scan took 11 s per slice.
The flow velocity time courses of the cerebral arterial segments were resolved by the MB‐DV PC‐MRI images.
To evaluate the performance of the proposed MB‐DV PC‐MRI on PI measurements, a retrospectively gated single‐band dual‐VENC 2D PC‐MRI sequence with the same imaging position and closely matched parameters was also performed for each individual slice on seven young participants (two female, 31.4 ± 7.7 years).
The total scan for acquiring the four slices lasted approximately 15–18 min depending on the heart rate.
To evaluate the reproducibility of PI measurements using MB‐DV PC‐MRI, a test–retest study was conducted.
Within the same scan session, a repeated MB‐DV scan with the same imaging positions was performed on 11 participants (two female, 37 ± 11.1 years) aged 21–53 years using the same imaging parameters as in Study 1.
As individual ages, the elasticity of arteries gradually diminishes in response to changes in blood pressure, leading to elevated arterial pulsatility [23].
Recent work has shown that aging is associated with increased arterial pulsatility and impaired cerebral vascular damping [23,24].
To study the aging effect on both PI and DF at different cerebral arterial levels, MB‐DV PC‐MRI was performed on nine young (29.4 ± 7.8 years) and nine elderly (68.3 ± 11.1 years) participants, following the same protocol as described in Study 1.
Maximum intensity projection (MIP) image generation.
An MIP image was generated by extracting the maximum signal intensity per voxel from the complex difference images throughout a cardiac cycle.
Low‐VENC data were used for generating MIP images for each slice, as they offer an improved VNR, resulting in better delineation of small distal arteries with slow flow.
Region of Interest (ROI) selection.
Given their relatively bigger vessel sizes and good contrast with background tissue, the vessel masks of C1 and C2, V3 and V4, M2/3, and A2/3 were manually drawn.
For the distal arteries (M4, A4, and P4) in Slice 4, the vessel mask was generated automatically usingKmeans clustering [25] followed by a careful visual inspection.
The generated mask was then overlaid on the axial TOF MIP image to further divide the vessel mask into MCA, ACA, and PCA territories.
Vessels that were relatively parallel to the imaging slice were excluded if their cross‐sectional length was at least twice the width [26].
To minimize the potential contamination of veins in Slice 4, vessels that showed negative velocities were also excluded, as venous flow is generally opposite to arterial flow.
The refined masks were then used for the subsequent analyses.
Background phase offset correction.
All phase images throughout a cardiac cycle were averaged to yield a mean phase image and standard deviation.
The background phase was extracted based on the standard deviation, and then polynomial fitting was performed to estimate the noise [27].
Subsequently, the resulting noise image was subtracted from the phase image of each cardiac phase.
All statistical analysis was performed in OriginPro (Version 2023b, OriginLab, Northampton, Massachusetts) and MATLAB (Version 2022b, MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts).
For the sake of simplicity, these arterial segments were grouped into large‐size arteries including C1, C2, V3, and V4; medium‐size arteries including M2/3 and A2/3; and small‐size arteries including M4, A4, and P4 for the following statistical analyses.
The Bland–Altman analysis [29] was performed to evaluate the test–retest reproducibility and cross‐validation, and the intraclass correlation coefficient two‐way mixed‐effects model with absolute agreement (ICC3,1) was used [30].
The Shapiro–Wilk test was conducted to examine the normality of PI and DF.
According to the data normality, the two‐samplet‐test was used to compare the DF values between the young and aged groups.
Linear regression was used to assess the association between age and PIs of the arterial segments obtained from MB‐DV PC‐MRI sequence.
In all analyses, a two‐tailedp< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Figure2presents the simulation results of PI estimation as a function of tilted angle at different SNR levels.
The simulations included vessels with different diameters to represent both larger and smaller cerebral vessel segments.
Overall, PI estimation is insensitive to vessel tilt and vessel size when SNR ≥ 20 dB, though larger vessels yield more reliable PI measurements.
When SNR drops to 10 dB, overestimation in PI along with increased variability was observed, particularly for smaller vessels.
The SNR from the in vivo data was calculated by dividing the mean signal intensities within the vessel mask of each slice by the standard deviation of the background noise measured outside the brain.
The measured SNRs across subjects were 42.72 ± 1.23, 40.59 ± 2.28, 38.08 ± 2.89, and 37.13 ± 3.31 dB from the phase maps and 42.85 ± 2.3, 40.22 ± 2.15, 41.77 ± 1.96, and 43.25 ± 3.33 dB from the magnitude images for Slices 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
As the SNRs of in vivo data were all greater than 30 dB, reliable PI measurements can be expected using 2D PC‐MRI with 1D velocity encoding.
Consistently, the in vivo PC‐MRI data also demonstrated comparable PI measurements between 1D through‐plane and 3D velocity encodings (FigureS1).
Simulation of PI as a function of vessel tilting angle at different SNR levels with different vessel diameters.
MB‐DV PC‐MRI scans were successfully performed on all participants.
Four slices were collected by MB‐DV PC‐MRI, with the slice positions indicated on the angiogram (Figure1a).
From bottom to top, C1 and V3 (Slice 1), C2 and V4 (Slice 2), M2/3 and A2/3 (Slice 3), and M4, A4, and P4 (Slice 4) segments were imaged, with the average gaps of 23.9 ± 6.6, 62.9 ± 6.6, and 26.8 ± 5.8 mm between each two adjacent slices across subjects.
Figure1b,cshow an example of an inline generated superimposed MB‐DV PC‐MRI image and offline reconstructed individual slice images, respectively.
One can appreciate an overall good depiction of multiple arterial segments.
The velocity waveforms of C1, C2, V3, V4, M2/3, A2/3, M4, A4, and P4 were successfully extracted from MB‐DV PC‐MRI images (Figure3).
As expected, the velocities from the ICA to downstream MCA segments gradually decreased, and so did the velocities from the VA to distal PCA.
The velocities of the ACA segments did not dramatically decrease from the proximal ICA.
One can also appreciate that pulsatile flow propagates from proximal to distal branches.
Figure4shows the average PI value per vessel segment across subjects.
The average PI values for the healthy young individuals are 0.63 ± 0.14, 0.61 ± 0.13, 0.55 ± 0.11, 0.59 ± 0.13, 0.47 ± 0.11, and 0.49 ± 0.13 for C1, C2, M2/3, A2/3, M4, and A4, respectively, and 0.68 ± 0.18, 0.63 ± 0.12, and 0.47 ± 0.13 for V3, V4, and P4, respectively.
All PI values measured by MB‐DV PC‐MRI fell in the reasonable range according to the previous studies [23].
As expected, PI gradually decreased from proximal to downstream distal segments, indicating a good elasticity of the arteries.

Figure5shows the Bland–Altman plots in PI measurements between MB‐ and SB‐DV PC‐MRI, demonstrating good agreement in PI measurements between the MB‐ and SB‐DV PC‐MRI for all sizes of arteries.
The correlation coefficient in PI values between MB and SB PC‐MRI was 0.96, 0.79, and 0.82 for large, medium, and small‐size arteries, respectively.
The limit of agreement (LoA) was [0.11, −0.05], [0.04, −0.1], and [0.16, −0.12] for large, medium, and small arteries.
Additionally, the ICC value was 0.96, 0.79, and 0.82 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [0.91, 0.98], [0.18, 0.96], and [0.60, 0.92] for the large, medium, and small arteries, respectively.
All these results indicate that MB‐DV PC‐MRI provides comparable PI measurement across different levels of cerebral arterial segments to the conventional single‐band PC‐MRI.

The test–retest reproducibility of PI measurements using MB‐DV PC‐MRI was evaluated using the Bland–Altman plots.
As shown in Figure6, the arteries from all three vessel sizes exhibited good reproducibility in PI measurements.
The correlation coefficient between test and retest PI measurements was 0.92, 0.86, and 0.82 for the large, medium, and small arteries, respectively.
The LoA was [0.10, −0.14], [0.10, −0.12], and [0.13, −0.14] for the large, medium, and small arteries, respectively.
The ICC values were 0.91, 0.84, and 0.82 with a 95% CI of [0.81, 0.96], [0.51 0.95], and [0.61, 0.92] for the large, medium, and small arteries, respectively.
The reproducibility of DF measurements by MB‐DV PC‐MRI was also evaluated (FigureS2).
The correlation coefficient and LoA between test and retest DF measurements were 0.83 with a 95% CI of [0.32, −0.25], and the ICC was 0.81 with a 95% CI of [0.65, 0.90].
All these results concentratedly indicate excellent reliability in PI and DF measurements using the MB‐DV PC‐MRI sequence.

Figures7and8show the comparisons of PI and DF measured by MB‐DV PC‐MRI between young and elderly participants.
The mean PI values for the large, medium, and small vessels were 0.62 ± 0.12, 0.56 ± 0.12, and 0.48 ± 0.12 in the young participants and 0.84 ± 0.11, 0.85 ± 0.13, and 0.64 ± 0.18 in the elderly participants, respectively, presenting a statistically significant difference between the two age groups (p< 0.001 for all three vessel levels) (Figure7).
Furthermore, significant correlations between age and PIs at the large, medium, and small arteries (p< 0.001) as well as individual vessel segments were obtained (p< 0.05) except for P4 (Figures S3 and S4).
The DF along C2‐M4 and C2‐M2 for elderly adults was comparable to young adults (p= 0.40, 0.29).
However, the DF along M2‐M4 was significantly higher in the elderly participants than that of the younger ones (p= 0.04) (Figure8).

In the present study, we developed a time‐efficient, high‐resolution multiband dual‐VENC PC‐MRI technique that incorporates SMS and dual‐VENC into the PC‐MRI acquisition to achieve simultaneous measurements of PI across multiple cerebral arterial segments within a single short scan.
Our work demonstrated the feasibility of using MB‐DV PC‐MRI to assess arterial pulsatility as well as DF across multiple vessel segments in the brain.
Both test–retest and cross‐validation studies demonstrated good reproducibility and reliability in PI measurements using the proposed MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
A pilot aging study showed overall strong correlations between age and PI measurements at different vessel levels, which are consistent with the previous study [24,31].
Additionally, altered DF along the cerebral arterial tree was observed in the elderly adults.
These findings suggest that MB‐DV PC‐MRI could be a promising MRI technique to study cerebral arterial pulsatility.
Previous studies have utilized separate single‐slice 2D PC‐MRI scans to study arterial pulsatility of major cerebral arterial segments [9,32].
However, the separate scans potentially suffer from interscan cardiac and other physiological variations and also potentially increase the total acquisition time.
Alternatively, 4D flow can be naturally used to assess cerebral arterial pulsatility across multiple vessel segments given its volumetric acquisition [15,16].
However, 4D flow inevitably compromises spatiotemporal resolution due to the extended scan time.
Assessing PI of distal cerebral arteries as a group using 4D flow with non‐Cartesian acquisition has been reported by Vikner et al. [31], which still suffered from the inherent limitations of 4D flow, such as the compromised spatiotemporal resolution due to the long scan time and limited VENC selection.
Additionally, distal small vessels may be challenging to reliably resolve due to stronger saturation effects of 4D flow.
Compared to conventional 2D PC‐MRI and 4D flow, MB‐DV PC‐MRI enables simultaneous measurement of PIs across multilevel brain vessels at a higher spatial resolution in a single scan.
This approach effectively eliminates interscan‐induced cardiac variations and also mitigates the saturation effects on slow flows in distal small arteries.
Our results demonstrate that MB‐DV PC‐MRI provides reliable PI measurements for both larger and smaller arteries.
In theory, 2D PC‐MRI with 3D velocity encoding can sufficiently measure actual flow velocities for PI calculation when the blood vessel is not perpendicular to the imaging plane.
However, there is always a tradeoff between the temporal resolution, velocity encoding directions, and scan time.
In this study, 1D through‐plane velocity encoding was applied in MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
Both simulation and in vivo results demonstrate that PI estimation primarily depends on the image SNR and is relatively resistant to vessel tilting angle when SNR > 20 dB.
As the overall SNR of our in vivo data was greater than 30 dB, no big effect of vessel tilting was expected on PI measurements, which are also in good accordance with previous findings [33].
The SMS or MB technique has been widely used in fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging to shorten the scan time and improve the temporal resolution [34].
More recent SMS has been introduced in PC‐MRI to improve imaging efficiency and flow velocity assessment [35,36,37].
In the present study, we evaluate the feasibility of PC‐MRI with SMS for simultaneous cerebral arterial pulsatility measurements across multiple brain vessel segments.
Different from conventional SMS design with equal‐spaced multislice positioning, varied gaps between adjacent slices were proposed in MB‐DV PC‐MRI, allowing for flexibly adjusting slice positions based on the vessel geometry.
CAIPIRINHA was implemented to increase the coil sensitivity profile differences for better image separation [20].
Our results showed that the simultaneously excited slices were adequately separated without apparent aliasing artifacts (Figure1).
An example of the g‐factor map is shown in FigureS5awith the maximumgvalue of 1.4.
The PI comparison between MB‐DV PC‐MRI and conventional SB PC‐MRI (Figure5) demonstrated the reliability of PI measurements using MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
In conventional phase‐contrast techniques, a single VENC is typically chosen above the anticipated maximum blood flow velocity to avoid phase aliasing during velocity calculation, which, however, makes PI measurement potentially unreliable, especially when measuring low velocities due to the insufficient VNR.
Applying a lower VENC can enhance the VNR, as the noise level is directly proportional to the VENC.
However, phase antialiasing errors can occur when measured flow velocities are much higher than the VENC.
Previous studies have demonstrated that PC‐MRI with dual‐VENC can effectively antialias the phase wraps in the low VENC data by referencing the high‐VENC phase information while achieving higher VNR [18,38].
Therefore, dual‐VENC can improve the delineation of vascular flow velocities across a wide range.
In this study, PIs across multiple cerebral arterial segments were assessed, in which the diameter of cerebral vascular trees varies from 0.75 to 4.67 mm, along with a wide velocity distribution [39,40,41].
To improve the delineation of flow velocity waveforms across different cerebral arterial segments, a dual‐VENC module was employed in the proposed sequence.
As expected, velocity waveforms across different vessel segments were clearly depicted (Figure3).
Reliable PI measurements in all larger, medium, and small arteries were obtained using the MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
However, it is worth noting that the interpretation of velocity measurements using the proposed technique should be cautious, given the presence of partial volume effects and potential vessel tilting.
Similar to conventional 2D PC‐MRI, in MB‐DV PC‐MRI, the greater arteries, such as the ICA, VA, M2/3, and A2/3, which were imaged in the lower three slices, can be easily determined using the magnitude images given their relatively large sizes and limited numbers.
However, for distal small arterial segments, such as M4, A4, and P4 in the top slice, due to their spread distribution and small vessel size, we introduced ak‐means clustering algorithm to automatically detect small vessels followed by a visual inspection, which significantly reduces the human burden as well as interoperator variations in the data processing.
Some constraints were also considered during the data processing to improve the reliability of the PI measurement, such as excluding the arteries that were relatively parallel to imaging planes and reducing contaminations from small veins.
All these approaches can help improve the reliability of cerebral PI assessments.
Aging is accompanied by the loss of elastin and increased collagen deposition in vessel walls, resulting in reduced arterial compliance, which can be represented as elevated arterial pulsatility and impaired damping along the cerebrovascular tree [23,42].
Assessing both arterial pulsatility and damping properties could advance our knowledge of the role of vascular dysfunctions in aging and neurovascular pathologies.
A large number of aging‐related studies have demonstrated elevated arterial pulsatility in cerebral arteries but are mainly limited to the relatively larger arterial segments.
In this study, consistently increased PI was obtained across all vessel segments in elderly adults, suggesting that aging induces a global effect on PI throughout the cerebral arterial tree.
On the other hand, damping is another important vascular feature.
Previous studies have shown that alterations in arterial damping may increase the number of perivascular spaces and exacerbate cognitive impairment [32].
MB‐DV PC‐MRI simultaneously images PIs of multiple arterial segments along the cerebral arterial tree, allowing for assessing DF from proximal to distal arterial segments.
In this study, the young adults showed gradually decreased DF along the arterial segments from ICA‐M2/3 to M2/3‐M4, suggesting the cerebral arterial system smoothly damps the pulsatile energy to protect the downstream vascular system.
Oppositely, the older adults had lower DF in the proximal ICA‐M2/3 but much higher DF in the downstream M2/3‐M4 segment, indicating that increased pulsatile energy needs to be damped in the downstream arteries, which may cause a significant burden to downstream small vessels and eventually contribute to vascular dysfunction and parenchymal vascular injury.
Our study has limitations.
Firstly, arterial segments including M1, A1, and P1/2 were not imaged using MB‐DV PC‐MRI in this study, as those segments were relatively parallel to the imaging slice (Figure1a).
Theoretically, MB‐DV PC‐MRI with three velocity encoding directions can solve this issue, which, however, can double both scan time and minimal temporal resolution.
Previous studies have reported similar PIs between ICA and M1 and between VA and P1/2 using 2D PC‐MRI [15].
In the present study, we imaged both proximal and distal ICA and VA segments, and the distal ones could approximate the arterial pulsatility of M1 and P1/2.
Secondly, a single through‐plane velocity encoding was used in this study given the fact that the majority of the orientation of cerebral arterial segments is along the interior to superior direction and is thus relatively perpendicular to the imaging slice.
However, according to the previous work as well as our simulation and in vivo data [9], PI measurement using a single velocity encoding direction does not cause a significant difference in PI measurement compared to that with three velocity encoding directions.
To refine the PI measurements, during the data processing, the detected vessels that had cross‐sectional lengths at least twice greater than their width were excluded for further analysis [41].
Furthermore, PI is defined as the ratio of peak velocity difference to the mean velocity; therefore, the PI calculation is relatively insensitive to the absolute velocities.
Thirdly, we reduced the bandwidth to boost image SNR and thus improve the delineation of small distal arteries, that is, M4, P3/4, and A3/4.
However, the lower bandwidth adversely led to a relatively longer TE (9.62 ms).
Additional MB‐DV PC‐MRI with a shorter TE of (6.49 ms) was initially tested.
Compared to our current protocol, velocity curves with stronger noise were observed as a result of SNR loss with a shorter TE.
Further optimization of sequence parameters will be conducted and evaluated in the future study.
Fourthly, although this study primarily focused on the feasibility of multiband PC‐MRI in cerebral PI measurements, the multiband RF can be further optimized in MB‐DV PC‐MRI.
In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and RF high‐voltage limits were not exceeded with the current multiband RF design [20].
However, advanced RF pulse design methods [43,44] can be considered to reduce peak amplitude without increasing SAR.
The g‐factor map can be further optimized by considering the relative spatial distances among the four slices.
According to the slice distance, the four slices can be grouped into two and then shifted the two groups (the top two slices vs. the bottom two slices) by FOV/2 and the two slices within each group by FOV/4 to further reduce g‐factor.
FigureS5shows a single case with slightly reduced g‐factor through this optimization, compared to the current approach.
However, no notable difference was observed between the resulting PI measurements (FigureS5c).
Further evaluation will be conducted in the future study.
Furthermore, although the test–retest study was conducted in a research cohort with a relatively broad age range, a systematic evaluation of the test–retest reproducibility of the proposed technique, especially in elderly participants, will be needed when conducting age‐related research.
In conclusion, this study introduces a fast PC‐MRI technique by integrating SMS or multiband technique and dual‐VENC strategy into the conventional 2D PC‐MRI sequence (MB‐DV PC‐MRI) to achieve simultaneous assessment of cerebral arterial pulsatility across multiple arterial segments in the brain.
Our work demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of using MB‐DV PC‐MRI to measure arterial pulsatility and DF across multiple arterial segments along the cerebral vascular tree.
Our work also shows that aging is associated with increased pulsatility and altered damping patterns across cerebral arterial segments.
Therefore, MB‐DV PC‐MRI could be a useful imaging tool to study cerebral arterial pulsatility, which may provide valuable insights into the vascular pathology of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
