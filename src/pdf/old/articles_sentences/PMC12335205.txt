This study aimed to molecularly characterizeProteus vulgaris, assess its antibiotic susceptibility and profile virulence genes in isolates from cattle showing clinical signs of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in Bangladesh.
A total of 61 samples, including nasal swabs and lung tissues, were collected from cattle of varying ages and sexes between January and June 2024.
Samples were cultured in sterile nutrient broth and streaked onto nutrient agar, blood agar, and MacConkey agar.
Identification was performed through Gram staining, biochemical assays and molecular techniques, including PCR and partial gene sequencing.
Antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated using the disc diffusion method, and virulence genes were detected by PCR.
The isolates exhibited swarming motility and hemolytic, greyish colonies on blood agar; small, circular, pale‐to‐yellow colonies with a fishy odour on MacConkey agar; and appeared as small, pink‐stained coccobacilli (singly or in pairs) under Gram staining.
Biochemical testing showed positive reactions for catalase, methyl red, indole and Voges–Proskauer tests, and negative results for lactose fermentation and oxidase.
PCR confirmedP.
vulgarisin 11 samples (18%).
Partial sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed 100% identity with strains reported in Germany and the USA.
All isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin but showed complete resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and tetracycline.
PCR analysis also identified the presence of the virulence genesluxSandrsbA.
This is the first report ofP.
vulgarisassociated with respiratory infections in cattle in Bangladesh.
A study in Bangladesh identifiedP.
vulgarisas a respiratory infection in cattle.
The genusProteuscomprises Gram‐negative, rod‐shaped, aerobic bacteria of the familyEnterobacteriaceae, within the phylumPseudomonadota(formerlyProteobacteria) (Rosalski et al.2012).Proteusspp.
are typically 0.4–0.8 µm in diameter and 1.0–3.0 µm in length, motile via peritrichous flagella, and noted for their swarming behaviour and distinct fishy odour (Wang and Pan2014).
The genus is named after a shape‐shifting figure from Homer'sOdyssey.
Currently, it includes five recognized species:P. mirabilis,P.
vulgaris,P.
penneri,P.
hauseriandP.
myxofaciens(O'Hara et al.2000b).P.
hauseriand three additional genomospecies were formerly grouped underP.
Members of this genus are commonly found in polluted water, soil and manure, where they play key roles in organic matter decomposition (Mordi and Momoh2009; Rozalski et al.1997).
Among these,P.
mirabilisandP.
vulgarisaccount for the majority of clinicalProteusisolates in animals.
Under suitable conditions,P.
vulgariscan act as an opportunistic pathogen, causing a variety of infections, including urinary tract infections, otitis, dermatitis, gastroenteritis, wound infections and respiratory tract infections such as bovine respiratory disease (BRD) (Rozalski et al.1997; Feglo et al.2010; Jacobsen et al.2008; Urban – Chmiel and Grooms2012).
BRD is a leading cause of illness and death in cattle, particularly affecting calves and young stock, and imposes significant economic losses on the livestock industry (de Oliveira et al.2016; Zeineldin et al.2017).
Clinical signs include high fever, depression, anorexia, cough, increased respiratory rate, abnormal lung sounds and nasal discharge.
BRD can present acutely or chronically and may lead to fatal outcomes (Radostits et al.2006; Baptista et al.2017).
Injectable antibiotics are commonly used to treat BRD; however, the widespread misuse of antimicrobials has contributed to the emergence of multidrug‐resistant (MDR) strains (Chowdhury et al.2015).
The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), combined with the presence of multiple virulence factors, poses serious challenges to effective treatment.
The pathogenicity ofProteusspp.
is regulated by a range of virulence genes, many of which are located within operons (Pathirana et al.2008; Harley and Prescott2002).
Therefore, precise bacterial identification, antimicrobial susceptibility profiling and virulence gene detection are essential for informed disease management strategies.
This study aimed to isolate and characterize pathogenicP.
vulgarisfrom cattle clinically suspected of BRD and to determine their antibiotic resistance profiles along with the presence of key virulence genes.
This study was conducted from January to June, 2024 in three regions of Bangladesh—Trishal (90.0242560°E, 24.2235986°N), Tangail (89.9500°E, 24.2500°N) and Mymensingh (89.9049°E, 24.4079°N), where outbreaks of BRD were reported.
Dairy and beef cattle of varying ages, breeds and sexes, reared under intensive and semi‐intensive farming systems and exhibiting clinical signs consistent with BRD, were selected for sampling.
Representative specimens, including deep nasal swabs collected using 6‐inch sterile plastic swabs and morbid lung tissues obtained post‐slaughter from affected animals, were collected, as summarized in Table1.
Samples were transported in iceboxes to the Bacteriology Laboratory of the Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, and stored at −20°C until further analysis (WOAH2022).
Morbid lung tissues were processed aseptically in the laboratory.
The tissues were cut into small pieces and homogenized using a sterile mortar and pestle, following the guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) (Barrow and Feltham1993).
Homogenates were prepared as 10% (w/v) suspensions in sterile phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), transferred into sterile Falcon tubes, and centrifuged twice at 1066 ×gfor 10 min at 4°C using a Digisystem tabletop centrifuge (model DSC‐200A‐2).
The resulting supernatants were collected for further analysis.
Nasal swabs were used directly without additional processing.
Processed lung homogenates and nasal swabs were inoculated into the nutrient broth and incubated at 37°C for 24 h in a shaking incubator at 180 rpm.
Enriched cultures were streaked onto nutrient agar, blood agar and MacConkey agar and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Blood agar, enriched with red blood cells, supports the growth ofP.
vulgarisand facilitates observation of haemolytic activity.
Colonies demonstrating haemolysis and swarming motility with clear zones were considered indicative ofP.
On MacConkey agar, colonies appeared colourless or pale with a distinct fishy odour due to the organism's inability to ferment lactose (Quinn et al.2011).
Colony morphology was documented, and Gram staining was performed for microscopic evaluation (Cheesbrough2022).
Several biochemical assays were conducted to confirm the identity ofP.
vulgaris, including tests for lactose fermentation, catalase, methyl red (MR), indole, Voges–Proskauer (VP) and oxidase.
In the lactose fermentation test,P.
vulgarisproduced no colour change in phenol red broth, indicating a negative result.
Catalase activity was confirmed by the rapid formation of bubbles upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide, signifying enzymatic breakdown into water and oxygen.
A red colour change upon the addition of MR indicated a positive MR test, confirming stable acid production.
In the VP test, a colour change demonstrated the presence of acetoin from glucose fermentation.
Indole production was confirmed by the appearance of a green‐coloured layer on the surface of the test medium.
The oxidase test yielded no colour change, indicating a negative result, consistent with the organism's lack of cytochrome c oxidase (Al‐mahemdy and Abdullah2020).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene was performed using species‐specific primers (Nei and Kumar2000) (listed in Table2) for molecular detection ofP.
Genomic DNA was extracted from processed morbid lung tissues and nasal swab samples using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
PCR amplification was conducted using a thermal cycler (Mastercycler Nexus, Eppendorf, Germany) and a Taq PCR kit (New England Biolabs, Inc.).
The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 54°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min; followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
Amplified PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.6 mg/mL ethidium bromide and visualized under a UV transilluminator to confirm the expected amplicon size.
List of primers used forP.
vulgarisand its virulence genes.
To confirm species identity, PCR amplicons from two representativeP.
vulgarisisolates (SSBAU‐PV19 and SSBAU‐PV35) were selected for partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.
Amplicons were purified and sequenced by a commercial sequencing provider.
Raw sequence data were processed, edited and annotated using BioEdit version 7.2 and CLC Sequence Viewer 8.
The resulting sequences were compared to existing entries in the GenBank database using the NCBI BLAST tool, and annotated sequences were submitted to GenBank for accession numbers.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed to evaluate the evolutionary relationships of theP.
vulgarisisolates.
A total of 18 16S rRNA gene sequences from GenBank were retrieved along with the two sequences generated in this study (TableS1).
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MEGA‐11 software.
The tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model (Felsenstein1985).
Bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates assessed the tree's robustness.
Evolutionary distances were estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method (Tamura et al.2021), and a scale bar was included to indicate genetic divergence.
All analyses were conducted using MEGA‐11 (Bauer et al.1996).
Antibiotic susceptibility of PCR‐confirmedP.
vulgarisisolates was assessed using the modified Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar plates (Abbas et al.2015).
Zone diameters were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (2018) (Buckham Sporer et al.2008).
The antibiotics tested included ceftriaxone (30 µg), ciprofloxacin (5 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), penicillin (10 µg), levofloxacin (5 µg), oxytetracycline (30 µg), ampicillin (10 µg) and amoxicillin (20 µg) (all from Oxford, UK).
Virulence gene profiling of PCR‐confirmedP.
vulgarisisolates was performed using gene‐specific primers (McVey2009) (see Table2).
PCR was carried out under the following thermal conditions: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 59°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
Cattle affected by BRD displayed a range of clinical signs, including elevated body temperature (up to 104°F), nasal, ocular and oral discharges, pronounced respiratory distress, open‐mouth breathing, coughing, drooping ears, lowered head posture, depression, lethargy, reduced feed intake, apprehension and an emaciated body condition.
At necropsy, the lungs were firm and consolidated, with a texture resembling liver tissue rather than the normal spongy appearance.
Discoloration was noted, predominantly dark red in colour.
Cultural and microscopic examination confirmed the presence ofP.
Isolates exhibited turbidity in nutrient broth, swarming motility on nutrient agar, and formed greyish‐white, haemolytic colonies on blood agar.
On MacConkey agar, colonies appeared small, circular, pale to yellowish in colour, and emitted a characteristic fishy odour.
Gram staining revealed small, pink‐stained, cocco‐bacillary occurring singly or in pairs, consistent with Gram‐negative morphology.
Biochemical tests further validated the identity of the isolates asP.
The isolates were negative for lactose fermentation (no colour change in phenol red broth), positive for catalase (bubble formation due to oxygen release), positive for MR (indicating stable acid production), positive for VP (indicating acetoin production) and positive for indole production (appearance of a green surface layer).
The oxidase test was negative, confirming the absence of cytochrome c oxidase.
PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the presence ofP.
vulgarisin 11 out of 61 samples (18%), including one lung tissue sample.
The expected amplicon size was 750 bp (Figure1).

Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from isolates SSBAU‐PV19 and SSBAU‐PV35 (GenBank accession numbersPV098405andPV098406, respectively) revealed 100% sequence identity withP.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolate SSBAU‐PV19 clustered with strain FDAARGOS_1507 (GenBank accessionCP083628), originally reported from Germany.
Isolate SSBAU‐PV35 grouped with strains PM57, FDAARGOS_556, and 2AH (GenBank accessionsCP137232,CP033736andKP289283), which originated from China, the USA and India, respectively (Figure2).
Phylogenetic tree in which the evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and General Time Reversible model with 100 bootstrap replicates.
The tree with the highest log likelihood (−16620.85) is shown.
The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches.
Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor‐Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value.
A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (2 categories [+G, parameter = 24.1315]).
This analysis involved 20 nucleotide sequences.
There were a total of 1527 positions in the final dataset.
Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA11.
Only bootstrap values above 70 are shown.
The PCR‐confirmedP.
vulgarisisolates showed variable susceptibility to the tested antibiotics.
The highest sensitivity was observed for ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (100%), followed by ciprofloxacin (78%), amoxicillin and gentamicin (67%) and oxytetracycline (44%).
No susceptibility was detected to penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin or tetracycline.
The resistance profile revealed complete resistance (100%) to penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and tetracycline, followed by resistance to oxytetracycline (56%), amoxicillin and gentamicin (33%) and ciprofloxacin (22%).
No resistance was observed against ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
PCR‐based profiling revealed the presence of two key virulence genes,rsbAandluxS, among theP.
vulgarisisolates.
ThersbAgene was detected in 9 isolates (82%) (Figure3A), and theluxSgene was present in 7 isolates (64%) (Figure3B).

In summary, these findings establish the involvement ofP.
vulgarisin respiratory infections among cattle with BRD in Bangladesh (Supplementary File2).
BRD continues to pose a significant threat to cattle health and productivity globally (Guiguère and Tessman2011).
It is estimated that the combined costs of treatment and prevention exceed $1 billion annually in the cattle industry (USDA2013).
Despite advances in management and therapeutic interventions, BRD remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and economic loss, while also raising animal welfare concerns.
The etiopathogenesis of BRD is complex and multifactorial, involving interactions between host susceptibility, environmental stressors and multiple pathogens.
Predisposing factors include high humidity, warm temperatures, poor ventilation, mixed‐age herds, overcrowding and physical or heat‐induced stress (Klima et al.2014).
In particular, heat stress can lead to open‐mouth breathing and deeper inhalation, facilitating the entry of opportunistic bacteria into the lower respiratory tract.
The bovine nasopharynx acts as both a reservoir for potential pathogens and a gateway for infection in BRD cases.
The disease is also associated with a non‐negligible case fatality rate, with approximately 4% of clinically treated animals succumbing to infection (Autio et al.2006).
The microbial aetiology of BRD varies depending on host factors, farm management practices and geographical regions (Frank et al.2002).
Common bacterial agents implicated includeMannheimia haemolytica(formerlyPasteurella haemolytica),Pasteurella multocida,Histophilus somni(formerlyHaemophilus somnus),Mycoplasma bovis,Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureusandProteus vulgaris(Rice et al.2007; Holman et al.2015; Ouchriah et al.2015; Algammal et al.2020; O'Connor et al.2016; Iroha et al.2011).
Previous studies by Algammal et al. (2020) (Iroha et al.2011) and Hafsa et al. (2020) (Nei and Kumar2000) described the typical cultural, morphological and biochemical traits ofP.
vulgaris, including diffuse turbidity in nutrient broth, swarming motility on nutrient agar, haemolytic colonies on blood agar and pale to yellowish colonies with a characteristic fishy odour on MacConkey agar.
Microscopically,P.
vulgarisappears as small, Gram‐negative, cocco‐bacillary arranged singly or in pairs.
Biochemically, it tests positive for catalase, MR, VP and indole, and negative for lactose fermentation and oxidase.
These observations are consistent with the findings of the present study.
In this study, suspected samples were further screened using conventional PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene withP.
vulgaris‐specific primers.
PCR remains one of the most accurate and reliable molecular tools for bacterial identification.
Similar to our findings, Holman et al. (2015) (Algammal et al.2020), Ouchriah et al. (2015) (O'Connor et al.2016) and Algammal et al. (2020) (Iroha et al.2011) reportedE.
vulgarisandS.
aureusas frequently isolated respiratory pathogens in pneumonic cattle.
While Algammal et al. observed a 12.4% detection rate forP.
vulgaris, our study reported an 18% PCR positivity rate.
This variation may be attributed to differences in farm management practices, hygiene standards and stress levels.
Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed low genetic divergence amongP.
vulgarisisolates, with only four nodes exhibiting bootstrap values above 70.
This suggests that while the 16S rRNA gene is suitable for species‐level identification, it provides limited phylogenetic resolution.
Further molecular analyses, such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) or whole genome sequencing (WGS), would offer more detailed phylogenetic insight but were beyond the scope of this study.
Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from isolates SSBAU‐PV19 and SSBAU‐PV35 confirmed 100% sequence identity withP.
vulgarisstrains previously reported from Germany, China, and the USA.
The use of antibiotics in the treatment of BRD is well established (Osibote et al.2014), yet the rise of MDR pathogens poses a growing threat to cattle health and the livestock industry (Frank et al.2002).
AMR is driven by intrinsic mechanisms, horizontal gene transfer and widespread antibiotic use in animal production systems (Gupta et al.2014).
Multiple drug resistance inProteusspp.
isolated from cattle has been reported in several studies (Bahashwan and El Shafey2013).
In the present study,P.
vulgarisisolates demonstrated variable susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
Earlier studies Kibret and Abera (2014), Mordi and Momoh (2009) (Mordi and Momoh2009), Feglo et al. (2010) (Feglo et al.2010), Bahashwan and El Shafey (2013) (Ahmed2015), Kibret and Abera (2014) (Owoseni et al.2022), Ahmed (2015) (Ronanki et al.2022), Algammal et al. (2020) (Iroha et al.2011), Owoseni et al. (2022) (Rozalski et al.2012) and Ronanki et al. (2022) (Taga et al.2001) have documented multi‐antibiotic resistance (MAR) inP.
vulgaris, with resistance to three or more antibiotics being a common finding.
Consistent with these reports, our study confirmed MAR in allP.
vulgarisisolates.
Although certain antibiotics have historically been effective, resistance trends are escalating.
All isolates in this study were fully susceptible to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (100%), whereas Algammal et al. (2022) (Ouchriah et al.2015) foundP.
vulgarisisolates to be sensitive only to meropenem and resistant to tetracycline, partially aligning with our observations.
The pathogenicity ofProteusspp.
has been linked to several virulence genes.
ThersbAgene acts as a sensory regulator responsive to environmental stimuli and contributes to biofilm formation and extracellular polysaccharide production (Rozalski et al.2012).
TheluxSgene encodes for autoinducer‐2 (AI‐2), a quorum‐sensing molecule involved in cell‐density‐dependent gene regulation [50].
The presence of bothrsbAandluxSgenes in our isolates is consistent with previous findings by Owoseni et al. (2022) (Rozalski et al.2012).
This investigation, encompassing cultural, morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization ofP.
vulgarisfrom nasal swabs of BRD‐affected cattle in Bangladesh, demonstrated the role of the bovine nasopharynx as both a reservoir and portal of entry forP.
These findings align with prior reports by Holman et al. (2015) (Algammal et al.2020), Ouchriah et al. (2015) (O'Connor et al.2016) and Algammal et al. (2020) (Iroha et al.2011), who also detectedP.
vulgarisin the upper respiratory tracts of various animals.
To our knowledge, this is the first documented report ofP.
vulgaris‐associated respiratory infection in cattle in Bangladesh.
The detection of multidrug resistance and virulence‐associated genes among these isolates underscores the urgent need for antibiotic stewardship and enhanced surveillance to monitor the emergence and spread of resistant and virulent strains.
Continued phenotypic and genomic surveillance of BRD‐associated pathogens is essential for guiding appropriate treatment strategies and limiting further dissemination.
This study confirms the presence of pathogenicP.
vulgarisin the respiratory tracts of cattle affected by BRD in Bangladesh, supporting its role as one of the multifactorial contributors to the condition.
The high level of antibiotic resistance observed in the isolates highlights the risk of environmental dissemination of resistant strains.
This resistance is likely driven by indiscriminate and prolonged use of antimicrobials, which exerts selective pressure and facilitates the emergence of MDR organisms.
It is imperative to promote rational, targeted antimicrobial use guided by susceptibility testing.
In some cases, combination therapy may offer a more effective strategy for managingP.
vulgaris‐associated respiratory infections.
To our knowledge, this is the first report documentingP.
vulgaris‐associated respiratory disease in cattle in Bangladesh.
These findings underscore the need for early detection of resistant strains and their virulence traits, highlighting the urgency of implementing robust antimicrobial stewardship practices to safeguard both animal and public health.
