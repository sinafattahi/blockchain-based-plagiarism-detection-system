Soft tissue sarcomas with Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1-POZ/BTB and AT Hook Containing Zinc Finger 1 (EWSR1-PATZ1) gene fusion represent a recently recognized subgroup of "round cell sarcomas with EWSR1-non-ETS fusions."
These tumors exhibit diverse morphologic features and a polyphenotypic immunoprofile, often co-expressing neural and skeletal muscle markers.
Their clinical behavior ranges widely, from indolent to highly aggressive.
We report the case of a 57-year-old man presenting with a 6.5 cm right abdominal wall mass incidentally discovered on CT imaging performed for choledocholithiasis.
Ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a low-grade spindle cell neoplasm, and the patient subsequently underwent marginal excision.
Microscopic examination showed solid and pseudocystic architecture with thick fibrous septa, composed of round and spindle cells with eosinophilic or clear vacuolated cytoplasm and vesicular chromatin.
Immunohistochemistry displayed positivity for CD99, BCL-2, and patchy desmin positivity.
Targeted gene fusion analysis confirmed EWSR1-PATZ1 fusion.
Given the long-standing, asymptomatic nature of the mass, the patient was managed with clinical surveillance and remains disease-free for three years post-excision.
Due to the rarity of these tumors, their biologic behavior and optimal management remain uncertain, highlighting the need for individualized treatment strategies and long-term follow-up.
Soft tissue sarcoma with Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1-POZ/BTB and AT Hook Containing Zinc Finger 1 (EWSR1-PATZ1) gene fusion is an emerging entity classified in the 5th edition of the WHO classification of soft tissue and bone tumors under “round cell sarcoma with EWSR1-non-ETS fusions” [1,2].
The EWSR1 gene is highly versatile, participating in fusion events with numerous partner genes across a range of mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal tumors.PATZ1, a member of the broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-à-brac-zinc finger (BTB-ZF) gene family, is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.EWSR1andPATZ1are closely positioned on chromosome 22, approximately 2 Mb apart, and typically transcribed in opposite directions [2-5].
The clinical presentation of these uncommon tumors varies according to the available literature [6].
Histologically, these tumors typically consist of relatively uniform, cytologically bland round to spindled cells embedded in a fibromyxoid stroma, which often contains prominent fibrous bands, hyalinized blood vessels, and pseudoalveolar or microcystic spaces.
Immunohistochemically, they usually exhibit a "polyphenotypic" profile, with co-expression of markers associated with skeletal muscle (e.g., desmin), epithelial cells (e.g., cytokeratin), Schwann cells (e.g., S100 protein), and glial cells (e.g., GFAP) [3,4,6-8].
The clinical behavior and prognosis of these tumors remain uncertain due to the limited number of reported cases [9].
In this case report, we present an indolent soft tissue EWSR1-PATZ1 round cell sarcoma arising in the abdominal wall.
This contributes to expanding the histopathologic spectrum of this rare entity.
Recognizing the variability withinEWSR1-PATZ1-rearranged sarcomas is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis with other soft tissue tumors.
A 57-year-old gentleman presented with a right abdominal wall mass identified on CT imaging performed for jaundice and choledocholithiasis.
Retrospectively, he had been aware of the mass for at least three years, with no significant change in size.
He was otherwise asymptomatic.
An abdominal CT scan revealed a 6.5 × 6.3 × 4.7 cm right abdominal wall mass.
The scout image revealed a faint soft tissue prominence along the right thoracoabdominal wall, without evidence of rib erosion or soft tissue calcification (Figure1).
(A) The scout image demonstrated subtle soft tissue prominence along the right thoracoabdominal wall at the level of the right 12th rib, without evidence of underlying rib erosion or soft tissue calcification.
(B) Magnified image highlighting the area of soft tissue prominence, suggestive of an underlying lesion (black arrows).
The mass was intramuscular, splaying the internal and external oblique abdominal wall muscles below the level of the 12th rib, best appreciated on axial and coronal images (Figure2).

The mass demonstrated mixed density (arrows).
A mild associated mass effect was noted.
Based on radiologic findings, the differential diagnosis included sarcoma, desmoid tumor, hematoma, or metastasis from an unknown primary.
Ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a hypercellular neoplasm composed of monotonous spindle cells with elongated and oval nuclei and dense chromatin.
Hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature with hyalinized vessel walls was present (Figure3).
The biopsy specimen revealed a hypercellular neoplasm composed of monotonous spindle cells with hyalinized blood vessels (10x).
Inset: tumor cells showing patchy positivity for desmin.
No necrosis or mitotic activity was identified.
The initial differential diagnosis included solitary fibrous tumor, synovial sarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, among others.
Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD99, BCL-2, and patchy desmin (Figure3inset).
Rare cells showed weak positivity for CKAE1/AE3.
The tumor was negative for STAT6, CD34, S100, SOX10, smooth muscle actin, EMA, myogenin, MyoD1, and WT1.
The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 5%.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative for rearrangement of the SS18 (18q11.2) locus.
The biopsy was signed out as a low-grade spindle cell neoplasm, with a recommendation for complete excision.
The case was referred to a radiation oncologist to evaluate the potential benefit of neoadjuvant radiotherapy.
An initial three-week course of radiation was considered.
However, the surgeon presented the case at the Multidisciplinary Sarcoma Tumor Board.
After expert review, the group determined that, in the absence of a definitive diagnosis of malignancy, preoperative radiation was not indicated.
The consensus was to proceed with marginal excision to allow for definitive histologic evaluation.
This approach aimed to avoid the morbidity of a full-thickness abdominal wall resection, reconstruction, and potential rib resection.
If malignancy was confirmed on final pathology, a full-thickness thoracoabdominal wall resection could be considered.
Marginal excision of the mass was performed via circumferential dissection.
The tumor separated easily from surrounding musculature, except on the deep side, where it appeared partially fixed to the underlying abdominal wall.
Therefore, muscle fibers were included in the specimen at the deep margin.
Grossly, the mass was well-circumscribed, gray-tan, and rubbery, measuring 6.7 × 6.0 × 4.8 cm and weighing 103 g. It was submitted with the attached portion of the abdominal wall.
The cut surface was predominantly solid, with areas of cystic change and fibrous septation (Figure4).
The mass was well-circumscribed, gray-tan, and rubbery.
The cut surface was solid with some cystic areas and fibrous septa.
Microscopically, the tumor was circumscribed and surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule that extended inward to divide the tumor into nests and nodules (Figures5A,5B).
Pseudoalveolar spaces containing proteinaceous material and numerous hyalinized vessels were observed (Figure5C).
The solid areas were composed of sheets of round and spindle cells with indistinct borders, eosinophilic to clear vacuolated cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin, and occasional small nucleoli (Figure5D).

(D) High-power view showing sheets of round to spindled cells with indistinct cell borders, eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin, and occasional small nucleoli (40x).
Tumor necrosis and mitoses were absent.
The resection specimen demonstrated identical immunohistochemical features to the biopsy specimen.
Next-generation sequencing (performed at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) targeting 138 genes, including those relevant to the major differential diagnoses such as BCOR, CIC, and SS18, identified anEWSR1-PATZ1gene fusion (data not shown).
Given the long-standing nature of the mass and its indolent features, it likely represents a tumor with nonaggressive behavior.
Although re-resection could be considered due to the close margins, it would require a radical thoracoabdominal wall resection including resection of adjacent ribs.
After the discussion, the sarcoma team recommended continued close surveillance.
Plans were made for follow-up imaging, including MRI and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in six months, followed by a comprehensive clinical review with the patient.
The patient has remained free of disease for three years following excision.
Round cell sarcomas featuring EWSR1-non-ETS fusions represent a rare subset of soft tissue tumors.
These sarcomas are defined by genetic rearrangements involving EWSR1 or FUS fused to non-ETS partners, in contrast to classic EWSR1-ETS fusions typically associated with Ewing sarcoma [6,10].
The PATZ1 gene encodes a zinc finger protein with tumor-suppressor functions and is located in close proximity to EWSR1 on chromosome 22 [9].
When EWSR1 and PATZ1 fuse in-frame, the resulting fusion protein lacks the transcriptional repressor domain of PATZ1, converting it into a transcriptional activator [9].
EWSR1-PATZ1 sarcomas can arise in the deep soft tissues of the chest or abdominal wall and have been reported across a wide age range [3,4,11].
A few cases have also been documented in the head and neck region as well as the central nervous system [12-14].
While approximately seven cases of EWSR1-PATZ1 sarcomas in the abdominal wall have been reported (Table1), their imaging characteristics remain poorly defined.
The CT findings in our case, similar to those in a previous case report [4], showed a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous intramuscular soft tissue mass.
However, the features are nonspecific and can mimic other abdominal wall lesions, such as desmoid tumors, hematoma, or metastasis.
M: male, F: female, N/A: not available, Sx: surgery, RT: radiation therapy, ANED: alive without evidence of disease, AWD: alive with disease, mets: metastasis.
These tumors manifest as solid-cystic masses and exhibit a range of histological features and immunophenotypic profiles (Table2).
Myogenic markers (desmin, myogenin, myoD1, SMA, caldesmon) and neurogenic markers (e.g., S100, SOX10, GFAP) are in bold.
Tumor cells typically appear as small, round, and/or spindled cells, often surrounded by fibrous stroma.
The presence of necrosis and mitotic figures can vary [11].
Immunophenotypically, they display a polyphenotypic profile, with inconsistent co-expression of myogenic markers (e.g., desmin, myogenin, myoD1) and neurogenic markers (e.g., S100, SOX10, GFAP) [8,9].
In our case, patchy desmin staining was present, but there was no expression of neurogenic or other myogenic markers, highlighting the tumor’s polyphenotypic nature [8].
The differential diagnosis may include a wide range of tumors with overlapping features, such as BCOR- or CIC-rearranged sarcomas, solitary fibrous tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, Ewing sarcoma, myoepithelioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [3].
Similar to our case, a prolonged history prior to clinical presentation has been reported in several instances, reflecting the indolent behavior of some EWSR1-PATZ1 sarcomas [7,9].
However, other cases have shown aggressive clinical courses, including locoregional or distant metastases and death within 5-32 months of diagnosis [9,13].
Non-infiltrative growth, low-grade spindle/round cell morphology, and a low mitotic count seem to be associated with a better prognosis [3].
These features are all present in our case, consistent with the favorable follow-up.
Some studies have identified secondary driver mutations, particularly involving CDKN2A, in a subset of these tumors, correlating with a poorer prognosis [3,9].
While we did not assess CDKN2A status in our case, the tumor’s prolonged indolent course suggests a low likelihood of such a mutation.
The optimal treatment approach for EWSR1-PATZ1 sarcomas remains undefined.
Reported cases have demonstrated resistance to systemic chemotherapy.
Given their malignant potential, at least complete surgical excision is recommended, followed by ongoing clinical surveillance [3,8,9,11].
In summary, round cell sarcomas with EWSR1-PATZ1 fusions represent a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse histological and immunophenotypic features across various anatomical sites.
In the absence of molecular confirmation, these tumors can be particularly difficult to diagnose due to their overlap with other small round cell neoplasms.
Their clinical behavior remains incompletely understood, and longitudinal data collection is needed to better stratify patients by risk.
While surgical resection with long-term follow-up remains the cornerstone of management, further studies are essential to clarify their biology and guide the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
