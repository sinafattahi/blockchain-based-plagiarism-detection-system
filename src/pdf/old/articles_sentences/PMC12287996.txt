Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) often rely on informal caregivers to promote healthy dietary intake and compliance.
Dyadic interventions show potential for enhancing patients' healthy diets, yet the effectiveness remains unexplored.
A systematic review and meta‐analysis were conducted.
PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched up to January 10, 2025.
This review included 29 articles (i.e., 25 studies) involving 3039 patients and 2706 caregivers.
Dyadic interventions significantly reduced patients' sodium intake, fat intake, body mass index, and improved self‐care behavior, quality of life, heart disease knowledge, self‐efficacy, and perceived support.
However, the interventions did not improve patients' blood lipid profiles.
Insufficient studies prevented meta‐analyses for patients' blood pressure and blood sugar levels, health motivation, communication, mutuality, caregivers' self‐care behavior, disease knowledge, quality of life, self‐efficacy/caregiver mastery, and caregiver burden.
Dyadic interventions showed preliminary evidence for improving CVD patients' diets.
High‐quality dyadic research is needed to validate current findings, assess the effectiveness on other dietary outcomes, and explore effective intervention characteristics.
Dyadic interventions effectively improved dietary‐related behavioral, health, cognitive, and psychological outcomes among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), demonstrating to health professionals the potential of engaging informal caregivers to enhance healthy eating behaviors and address poor dietary adherence in CVD patients.
Greater attention to dyadic approaches in CVD dietary management is needed, as few studies have focused exclusively on dyadic dietary interventions.
Future dyadic dietary trials should incorporate dyadic theories in intervention design, specify joint or separate interventions for the dyad, report strategies for optimizing dyadic dynamics, define clear caregiver eligibility criteria, specify caregivers' inclusion in the control group, and report caregivers' demographics.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), primarily including ischemic heart disease and stroke, are a significant global health burden (World Health Organization2021).
In 2022, CVDs caused 19.8 million deaths, leading to 396 million years of life lost and 44.9 million years lived with disability (Mensah et al.2023).
An unhealthy diet is a major modifiable risk factor for CVD (Roth et al.2020).
This highlights the importance of addressing dietary risks in CVD patients.
According to the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study (GBD), 15 types of dietary risk accounted for 7.94 million CVD deaths (42.7% of the total number of CVD deaths).
These dietary risks also contributed to 188 million disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) (Roth et al.2020).
These dietary risks included a diet low in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, milk, fiber, calcium, omega‐3 fatty acids from seafood, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a diet high in red meat, processed meat, sugar‐sweetened beverages, trans‐fatty acids, and sodium (Roth et al.2020).
Over the past three decades, both the absolute number of diet‐related CVD deaths and related DALYs have increased by 43.8% and 34.3% worldwide, respectively (Dong et al.2022).
This concerning trend highlights the urgent need to effectively promote healthy diets generally, and especially among high‐risk patients with established CVD.
A healthy diet promotes wellness and prevents disease by providing sufficient but not excessive nutrients from nutritious foods while avoiding the consumption of harmful substances (Neufeld et al.2023).
Adherence to a healthy diet can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent CVD events, such as myocardial infarction by 14% and stroke by 19% (Dehghan et al.2012).
It can also lower all‐cause mortality by 30% (Mente et al.2023).
Despite such healthy benefits and strong recommendations from international health guidelines, adherence to healthy diets remains poor among CVD patients (Bonekamp et al.2024).
A meta‐analysis found that lifestyle modification interventions have small to moderate effects on promoting healthy diets for CVD patients.
These effects are larger and more sustainable when patients' families are involved (Janssen et al.2013).
This is because most dietary activities occur in family settings (Quinn et al.2010).
Informal caregivers, who are often family members, frequently manage the diet of CVD patients.
This management includes tasks such as planning meals, purchasing food, and preparing and cooking meals (Kitko et al.2020).
For instance, stroke survivors with post‐stroke physical or cognitive impairments may be unable to cook or buy food.
Similarly, heart failure patients who experience fatigue may have difficulty managing their own diets.
Therefore, the assistance of informal caregivers in dietary activities is crucial for these patients (Moser and Watkins2008; Poole et al.2011).
A dyadic intervention involves two individuals (a dyad), typically sharing a close relationship, such as spouse dyads and patient–family member dyads (Sebern and Whitlatch2007).
Existing review studies have demonstrated the positive impacts of dyadic interventions for CVD patients on their physical functioning and functional independence (Mou and Wong2021; Pucciarelli et al.2021), memory (Pucciarelli et al.2021), and quality of life (Pucciarelli et al.2021).
Dyadic interventions can be particularly beneficial in promoting healthy diets and improving dietary adherence in CVD patients, considering the interconnected nature of dietary activities among informal caregivers and CVD patients (Chung et al.2020).
Indeed, a meta‐analysis study identified that dyadic interventions involving family members resulted in a significant improvement in reducing excessive sodium intake, a critical modifiable dietary risk factor for CVD patients (Yan et al.2024).
Within patient–caregiver partnerships, reviews further emphasize the importance of dyadic dynamics and interactions for enhancing intervention effectiveness (Bidwell et al.2023; Yu et al.2024).
For instance, when the patient exhibits non‐adherent dietary behavior, effective dyadic dynamics might have the potential to promote the patient's adherence to desired dietary behaviors (Lyons and Lee2018).
Therefore, dyadic dynamic optimization, referring to intervention strategies designed to enhance the social dynamics (e.g., communication, collaboration, and support) within dyads to promote better collaborative coping in disease management and address mutual needs (Yu et al.2024), is of particular importance in dyadic interventions for promoting healthy eating.
However, there is currently no comprehensive evidence synthesis on the effectiveness of dyadic interventions for promoting healthy diets in CVD patients.
Thus, a systematic review and meta‐analysis to determine the effectiveness of dyadic interventions on healthy diets among CVD patients is both timely and necessary.
The aim of this review was to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of dyadic interventions in promoting healthy diets among CVD patients on outcomes in both patients and their informal caregivers, and (2) summarize dyadic intervention characteristics and explore whether applying dyadic dynamic optimization strategies is associated with greater intervention effectiveness, contingent upon the availability of sufficient studies for meta‐analysis.
A systematic review and meta‐analysis were conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins et al.2019) and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines (Page et al.2021).
This review was registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42023473308).
Medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords related to “cardiovascular disease,” “dyad,” “informal caregiver,” “diet,” “food,” and “nutrition” were used to identify relevant articles.
Searches were conducted across six databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, from database inception to 10 January 2025.
Reference lists of included studies and similar reviews of dyadic interventions were also manually searched and screened (Bakas et al.2014,2017; Bernard et al.2023; Buck et al.2018; Mou and Wong2021; Pucciarelli et al.2021; Yu et al.2024).
Details of the search query are outlined in TableS1.
Eligibility criteria following the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study design (PICOS) framework were used.
P: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVD patients include those with coronary heart disease, stroke, other cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and rheumatic heart disease (World Health Organization2021).
Only adult CVD patients (age ≥ 18 years) were included.
I: The intervention was non‐pharmacological and had a dietary behavioral change component.
The dietary intervention could either focus exclusively on promoting a healthy diet or combine it with additional components such as physical activity for CVD patients.
Aligning with modifiable dietary risk factors from the GBD 2019 study (Dong et al.2022; Roth et al.2020), the eligible dietary intervention component involved modifications to whole dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet/DASH diet), foods/food groups (e.g., fruits and vegetables), or macronutrients and micronutrients (e.g., fat and sodium) (Zhang et al.2023).
Feeding experiments or nutrition supplementation research were excluded because to not involve dietary behavior change.
Since the intervention of interest utilized a dyadic approach, at least one intervention group should involve dyads consisting of one adult patient diagnosed with CVD and one adult informal caregiver.
Informal caregivers are “individuals who provide unpaid and ongoing assistance with activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living to individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities,” including spouse/partner, offspring, relatives, and friends (Roth et al.2015).
Studies where informal caregivers' participation in the intervention group was optional or those including more than one informal caregiver per patient were excluded.
C: In this review, no restrictions were imposed regarding the inclusion of informal caregivers in the control group.
This approach aimed to ensure the inclusion of a broader range of studies and provided a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of dyadic intervention across different implementation strategies.
O: In this review, given the nature of the eligible dietary interventions focused on dietary behavior change and promoting healthy eating of CVD patients, the primary outcomes were diet‐related behavioral and health outcomes in patients and/or informal caregivers.
Evaluating dietary intake is inherently complex due to the wide range of dietary outcome indicators (Afshin et al.2019; Roth et al.2020).
Therefore, diet‐related behavioral outcomes using indicators such as dietary adherence behavior score, food or nutrient consumption amounts, and the proportions of participants following dietary recommendations were included.
Diet‐related health outcomes, such as blood pressure and blood lipid profiles, were included to evaluate the impact of dietary changes on health conditions.
The secondary outcomes of interest also included cognitive and psychosocial outcomes related to dietary behavior change in CVD patients and/or their informal caregivers (Buck et al.2018), since adherence to a healthy diet or changing dietary behavior is also influenced by cognitive factors (e.g., dietary or disease management knowledge and awareness) and psychosocial factors (e.g., self‐efficacy, perceived support, and health motivation) (Chen and Antonelli2020).
S: For the study design, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐experimental studies published in English with full text available were included.
Quasi‐experimental studies with pre‐ and post‐testing design involving at least two interventional groups were included to provide more information regarding dyadic intervention design.
Duplicate articles were removed during the initial screening using EndNote 20.
Two authors (Y.Y.
independently screened articles and performed data extraction.
Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third author (J.L.
The extracted study characteristics included: author, year, country/region, patient and caregiver participant characteristics, patient–caregiver dyadic relationship, dropout rate, outcomes, and outcome measurement methods.
The extracted intervention characteristics were: dietary intervention, intervention/follow‐up duration, session number and duration, frequency, delivery mode (e.g., face‐to‐face and web‐based), interventionist, theoretical framework, dyadic dynamic optimization, and control group conditions.
The methodological quality of the included studies was independently appraised by two authors using the Cochrane Risk‐of‐Bias (ROB 2) tool for RCTs (Sterne et al.2019) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool in Non‐Randomized Studies of Intervention (ROBINS‐I) for quasi‐experimental studies (Sterne et al.2016).
The ROB2 tool evaluates the risk of bias across five domains, namely the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results.
The overall risk of bias of ROB2 was assigned a rating of “low risk” if all of the domains had low risk, “some concerns” if one or more domains had some concerns but no domain had high risk, or “high risk” if at least one domain had high risk.
Except for the five domains in ROB 2, the ROBINS‐I tool assessed two additional domains, including bias due to confounding and bias in the selection of participants into the study.
The overall risk of bias of ROBINS‐I is rated as low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, critical risk of bias, or no information (Sterne et al.2016).
The study and intervention characteristics were analyzed using descriptive analysis.
Meta‐analyses were conducted for outcomes reported in three or more studies to increase statistical power and provide more precise effect estimates (Turner et al.2013).
The results were reported as mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), or odds ratio (OR), accompanied by corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and heterogeneity (I2) (Higgins et al.2019).
The MD and SMD calculations were based on means of change from baseline in each group (Higgins et al.2019).
Standard deviations (SDs) of post‐intervention means were computed based on a correlation coefficient (r= 0.5) in each group (Higgins et al.2019), if such data were not reported in the original trial.
Heterogeneity levels were classified as low, moderate, or high based onI2thresholds of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively (Higgins et al.2003).
Random‐effects models with the inverse variance method were adopted to evaluate the effectiveness whenI2≥ 50%; otherwise, fixed‐effects models were used.
Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out approach were performed to assess the robustness of the results and identify sources of statistical heterogeneity (Higgins et al.2019).
Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether applying dyadic dynamic optimization strategies was associated with enhanced effects, provided sufficient studies were available (i.e., ≥ 2 studies/intervention groups per subgroup) (Yu et al.2024).
Statistical significance was defined as ap< 0.05.
Meta‐analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4 software.
Literature searches identified 10 443 relevant records from the six databases.
After removing duplicates, screening the remaining 6983 records yielded 161 preliminary eligible records.
An additional 159 articles were identified from the manual search.
After full‐text review, 29 articles (i.e., 25 studies) were included in the final analysis (Figure1).
There were 25 RCTs (i.e., 21 studies) and 4 quasi‐experimental studies.
Study characteristics are summarized in Table1.
The included studies were conducted in 15 countries/regions, with most in the United States (n= 9) (Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Ifejika et al.2020; Irani et al.2021; Schwarz et al.2008; Sher et al.2014; Stamp et al.2016; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), followed by Iran (n= 5) (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Kola et al.2021; Rakhshan et al.2015; Shahriari et al.2013).
Overall, most studies (n= 12) were conducted in Asian countries (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Deek et al.2017; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Kamal et al.2020; Kim et al.2013; Kola et al.2021; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Shahriari et al.2013; Shao and Chen2019; Srisuk et al.2017; Wong et al.2023).
The total sample size ranged from 58 to 865.
The dropout rate ranged from 0% to 46.2%, with a mean of 19.5%, although most studies did not specify whether dropouts were dyadic or involved a single party within the dyad.

There were 3039 (range: 29–510) CVD patients in total (mean age: 62.8 years, range: 51.2–79.9), comprising 2220 with heart failure (n= 14) (Ågren et al.2012; Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Cossette et al.2016; Deek et al.2017; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Irani et al.2021; Kola et al.2021; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Shao and Chen2019; Srisuk et al.2017; Stamp et al.2016; Vellone et al.2020), 591 with stroke (n= 5) (Ifejika et al.2020; Kamal et al.2020; Kim et al.2013; Nir et al.2004; Wong et al.2023), 410 with coronary heart/artery disease (n= 3) (Schuler et al.1992; Sher et al.2014; Vanelderen et al.1994), 60 with myocardial infarction (n= 1) (Kemenade et al.1994), 34 undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (n= 2) (Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), and 34 with acute coronary syndrome (n= 1) (Habibzadeh et al.2021).
Particularly, only one out of five studies involving stroke survivors reported functional feeding or swallowing limitations, which may affect their eating ability and behavior (Wong et al.2023).
Patients were predominantly male in most studies, with male patient proportions ranging from 42.9% to 100%.
A total of 2706 informal caregivers were included (range: 16–355).
Twelve studies reported caregiver age (mean: 54.7 years, range: 39.3–68.5).
Eleven studies reported the proportions of female caregivers (mean: 75.8%, range: 18.3%–83.0%) (Ågren et al.2012; Cossette et al.2016; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Irani et al.2021; Kola et al.2021; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Shahriari et al.2013; Sher et al.2014; Srisuk et al.2017; Stamp et al.2016; Vellone et al.2020; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), with 10 studies having mostly female caregivers.
Most of the studies (n= 23) specified the patient–caregiver dyadic relationship.
Partners/spouses constituted the largest proportion of caregivers (mean: 75.0%, range: 3.1%–100%), followed by adult children/offspring (mean: 29.9%, range: 21.9%–50.7%).
A variety of outcome indicators were assessed for both patients and caregivers across the included studies.
For patients, behavior outcomes were categorized, such as nutrient consumption (e.g., sodium, fat, cholesterol, and fiber intake) and adherence to diet‐related self‐care behaviors (e.g., dietary behavior/healthy eating habit scores).
Health outcomes encompassed such as body mass index (BMI), body weight reduction, lipid profiles, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.
Cognitive outcomes focused on disease knowledge, while psychological outcomes included self‐efficacy, perceived support, quality of life, health motivation, communication, and mutuality.
For caregivers, fewer outcomes were identified compared to patients, which included self‐care behavior scores, disease knowledge, quality of life, self‐efficacy/caregiver mastery, and caregiver burden (Ågren et al.2012; Cossette et al.2016; Irani et al.2021; Kim et al.2013; Kola et al.2021; Schwarz et al.2008; Srisuk et al.2017; Vellone et al.2020; Yates, Norman, et al.2015).
Intervention characteristics are outlined in TableS2.
Five studies exclusively provided dietary interventions, including sodium intake reduction (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Dunbar et al.2005,2013), body weight reduction via dietary change (Ifejika et al.2020), and sodium intake and fluid restriction (Shao and Chen2019).
Conversely, the other studies incorporated a healthy diet as a component of a comprehensive intervention (Ågren et al.2012; Cossette et al.2016; Deek et al.2017; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Irani et al.2021; Kamal et al.2020; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Kola et al.2021; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schuler et al.1992; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Sher et al.2014; Srisuk et al.2017; Vanelderen et al.1994; Vellone et al.2020; Wong et al.2023; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), alongside other components such as physical activity (Kemenade et al.1994; Schuler et al.1992; Sher et al.2014) and psychological education (Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Nir et al.2004; Vanelderen et al.1994).
The mean intervention and follow‐up durations were 3.3 months (range: 4 days to 12 months) and 4.6 months (range: 0–12 months), respectively.
Four studies did not specify the intervention duration (Cossette et al.2016; Deek et al.2017; Kemenade et al.1994; Schwarz et al.2008), and five studies did not have a post‐intervention follow‐up (Ifejika et al.2020; Kim et al.2013; Schuler et al.1992; Srisuk et al.2017; Wong et al.2023).
The number of intervention sessions varied from 3 to 50.
The duration of each session ranged from 1 min to 2 h, with eight studies having sessions less than 1 h (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Cossette et al.2016; Ifejika et al.2020; Irani et al.2021; Kamal et al.2020; Kim et al.2013; Kola et al.2021; Srisuk et al.2017) and nine studies having sessions lasting 1–2 h (Ågren et al.2012; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Kemenade et al.1994; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Shahriari et al.2013; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994; Wong et al.2023).
Interventions were delivered daily (Schwarz et al.2008), weekly (n= 8) (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Irani et al.2021; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Nir et al.2004; Shahriari et al.2013; Sher et al.2014; Vanelderen et al.1994), from daily to weekly (Habibzadeh et al.2021; Ifejika et al.2020), bi‐weekly (Kola et al.2021), from weekly to monthly (Kamal et al.2020; Srisuk et al.2017), and ≥ monthly (Ågren et al.2012; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Schuler et al.1992; Wong et al.2023).
While the other studies provided partial details of frequency or did not specify or report on frequency.
The most common delivery mode was face‐to‐face delivery (n= 9) (Cossette et al.2016; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schuler et al.1992; Sher et al.2014; Vanelderen et al.1994; Wong et al.2023; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), followed by a combination of face‐to‐face and telephone follow‐up (n= 7) (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Deek et al.2017; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Kemenade et al.1994; Shahriari et al.2013; Stamp et al.2016; Vellone et al.2020), and a combination of face‐to‐face and computer‐based program (n= 2) (Ågren et al.2012; Irani et al.2021; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017).
Other studies used face‐to‐face delivery alongside other technologies such as mobile applications (Ifejika et al.2020) and DVDs (n= 3) (Kola et al.2021; Shao and Chen2019; Srisuk et al.2017).
Only four studies used web‐based programs (Kim et al.2013; Schwarz et al.2008) or mobile phone applications (Ifejika et al.2020; Kamal et al.2020) to deliver the intervention.
The intervention was most often delivered by nurses (n= 17) (Ågren et al.2012; Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Cossette et al.2016; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Irani et al.2021; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Shao and Chen2019; Sher et al.2014; Stamp et al.2016; Vellone et al.2020; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), followed by dietitians (n= 6) (Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Kemenade et al.1994; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994; Wong et al.2023; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015).
Twelve studies applied a single theoretical framework (Cossette et al.2016; Deek et al.2017; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schuler et al.1992; Schwarz et al.2008; Shao and Chen2019; Srisuk et al.2017; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994), and six studies used multiple theoretical frameworks (Ågren et al.2012; Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Irani et al.2021; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Sher et al.2014; Wong et al.2023; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015).
Seven studies did not use any theoretical framework (Ifejika et al.2020; Kamal et al.2020; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Kola et al.2021; Shahriari et al.2013; Vellone et al.2020).
None of the studies used dyadic theories, while three studies applied theories related to family and interpersonal contexts, including the self and family management framework, relational coordination theory, and the family‐centered rehabilitation model (Deek et al.2017; Irani et al.2021; Rakhshan et al.2015).
Strategies for enhancing dyadic dynamic optimization were explicitly incorporated as formal components of the interventions in 13 studies (Ågren et al.2012; Cossette et al.2016; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Irani et al.2021; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Nir et al.2004; Shahriari et al.2013; Sher et al.2014; Srisuk et al.2017; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994; Wong et al.2023).
These strategies included cognitive‐behavioral support for dyads on disease perception and behavior change (Ågren et al.2012; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Vanelderen et al.1994), communication skills training for promoting patients' autonomy behavior change (Cossette et al.2016; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Irani et al.2021; Shahriari et al.2013; Sher et al.2014; Stamp et al.2016), emotional management during patients' behavior change (Irani et al.2021; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Shahriari et al.2013; Vanelderen et al.1994), and cooperation for building a conducive environment for behavior change (Nir et al.2004; Srisuk et al.2017; Wong et al.2023).
The control groups received either standard care (e.g., cardiology care or physical rehabilitation) (Ågren et al.2012; Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Cossette et al.2016; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Kamal et al.2020; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Shao and Chen2019; Srisuk et al.2017; Vanelderen et al.1994; Vellone et al.2020; Wong et al.2023) or active control (e.g., paper food diaries plus dietary adherence education) (Deek et al.2017; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Ifejika et al.2020; Irani et al.2021; Kola et al.2021; Schuler et al.1992; Sher et al.2014; Stamp et al.2016; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015).
Most of the studies included caregivers in the control group (n= 18) (Ågren et al.2012; Cossette et al.2016; Deek et al.2017; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Ifejika et al.2020; Irani et al.2021; Kamal et al.2020; Kim et al.2013; Kola et al.2021; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Nir et al.2004; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Srisuk et al.2017; Stamp et al.2016; Wong et al.2023; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), while seven studies did not recruit caregivers for the control group (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Kemenade et al.1994; Schuler et al.1992; Shao and Chen2019; Sher et al.2014; Vanelderen et al.1994; Vellone et al.2020).
For RCTs, 13 studies were rated as having a low risk of bias (Ågren et al.2012; Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Deek et al.2017; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Habibzadeh et al.2021; Ifejika et al.2020; Kamal et al.2020; Kemenade et al.1994; Kim et al.2013; Liljeroos et al.2015,2017; Rakhshan et al.2015; Schuler et al.1992; Sher et al.2014; Srisuk et al.2017; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994; Vellone et al.2020; Wong et al.2023), while eight studies had some concerns of bias (TableS3.1) (Cossette et al.2016; Irani et al.2021; Kola et al.2021; Nir et al.2004; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Shao and Chen2019; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015).
Six studies had some concerns on deviations from intended interventions (Domain 2) due to incorrect application of intention‐to‐treat analysis when examining intervention effects (Kola et al.2021; Nir et al.2004; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Shao and Chen2019; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015).
Five studies had some concerns on measurement of the outcome (Domain 5), as published or pre‐registered protocols were unavailable (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Irani et al.2021; Schwarz et al.2008; Shahriari et al.2013; Yates, Norman, et al.2015; Yates, Rowland, et al.2015), suggesting the results may not have been analyzed according to pre‐specified plans.
For quasi‐experimental studies, one study was rated as having a low risk of bias (Habibzadeh et al.2021), while the remaining studies exhibited a moderate risk of bias (TableS3.2) (Kemenade et al.1994; Vanelderen et al.1994; Wong et al.2023).
Among the six studies evaluating the effectiveness of dyadic interventions in reducing sodium intake (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Kim et al.2013; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994; Wong et al.2023), three outcome indicators were identified: 24‐h urinary sodium (24HUNa) (Akhondzadeh et al.2018; Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Stamp et al.2016), self‐report sodium intake assessed by dietary recall (Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Stamp et al.2016; Wong et al.2023), and the proportion of participants who reduced salty food intake (Dunbar et al.2005,2013; Kim et al.2013; Stamp et al.2016; Vanelderen et al.1994).
For 24HUNa, the meta‐analysis demonstrated that dyadic interventions significantly decreased 24HUNa at 1.5‐ to 4‐month follow‐up (MD = −566.05 mg/24 h, 95% CI = −946.83 to −185.27,p= 0.004,I2= 0%; FigureS1.1), equivalent to a 1.42 g salt intake reduction over 24 h, compared to controls.
The effect remained significant at 3‐ to 8‐month post‐intervention (MD = −550.27 mg/24 h, 95% CI = −966.36 to −134.17,p= 0.01,I2= 0%; FigureS1.2), equivalent to a 1.38 g salt intake reduction over 24 h. Leave‐one‐out sensitivity analyses showed both effects changed after removing one study without caregiver involvement in the control group (Akhondzadeh et al.2018).
Subgroup analyses of dyadic dynamic optimizations showed no significant difference in 24HUNa reduction (TableS4).
For self‐report dietary sodium intake, significant effects were shown at the 3‐ to 4‐month follow‐up (MD = −606.74 mg/24 h, 95% CI = −1073.75 to −139.72,p= 0.01,I2= 59%; FigureS1.3).
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the effect became insignificant after removing one study where the control group received usual care at the 3‐ to 4‐month follow‐up (Wong et al.2023); however, this did not resolve the substantial heterogeneity.
For the proportion of participants who reduced salty food intake, the intervention groups had a significantly greater proportion than the control group at the 3‐ to 4‐month follow‐up (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.22–2.87,p= 0.004,I2= 0%; FigureS1.4) and the 8‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.26–3.08,p= 0.003,I2= 45%; FigureS1.5).
Sensitivity analyses revealed that the effect became insignificant after excluding one quasi‐experimental study (Vanelderen et al.1994) at the 3‐ to 4‐month follow‐up.
Publication bias was not assessed due to insufficient studies for the three outcomes.
Meta‐analysis integrating four studies revealed dyadic interventions significantly reduced fat intake at 3‐ to 18‐month follow‐up (SMD = −0.45, 95% CI = −0.69 to −0.21,p= 0.0002,I2= 27%; FigureS2).
The effect attenuated to non‐significance when one study that had a long follow‐up (i.e., 12 months) was excluded during sensitivity analysis (Schuler et al.1992).
At 3‐ to 6‐month follow‐up, a significant reduction in BMI was observed in the dyadic intervention groups (MD = −1.22 kg/m2, 95% CI = −2.07 to −0.37,p= 0.005,I2= 0%; FigureS3).
Sensitivity analysis rendered the effect non‐significant after excluding one study that had a long follow‐up (i.e., 12 months) (Schuler et al.1992).
Dyadic interventions demonstrated significant enhancement in CVD patients' self‐care behavior at 1‐ to 3.5‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.18–0.73,p= 0.001,I2= 69%; FigureS4.1), but none at the 2‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI = −0.05 to 0.64,p= 0.09,I2= 75%; FigureS4.2).
The effect at the 1‐ to 3.5‐month follow‐up remained statistically significant in sensitivity analyses, although substantial heterogeneity persisted.
While removing one study that had a long follow‐up (i.e., 12 months) (Ågren et al.2012), the effect at the 2‐ to 12‐month follow‐up became statistically significant.
Subgroup analyses showed that dyadic dynamic optimizations did not associate with the enhanced effects (TableS4).
Dyadic interventions did not significantly improve patients' blood triglyceride levels at 3‐month follow‐up (SMD = −0.19, 95% CI = −0.48 to 0.10,p= 0.19,I2= 0%; FigureS5.1) and blood total cholesterol levels (SMD = −0.09, 95% CI = −0.74 to 0.56,p= 0.79,I2= 75%; FigureS5.2).
Sensitivity analyses for both lipid biomarkers did not alter the effects.
Dyadic interventions significantly improved the mental component score of quality of life in 1‐ to 3‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.12–0.44,p= 0.0004,I2= 0%; FigureS6.1) but not the physical component score (SMD = 0.06, 95% CI = −0.12 to 0.23,p= 0.52,I2= 0%; FigureS6.2).
Both results remained robust, as confirmed by sensitivity analyses.
Subgroup analyses did not support an association between dyadic dynamic optimization strategies and improved quality of life (TableS4).
Dyadic interventions significantly improved heart disease knowledge at 3‐ to 4‐month follow‐up (SMD = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.18–2.82,p= 0.03,I2= 96%; FigureS7.1), but the effects were not maintained at 8‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI = −0.22 to 2.44,p= 0.10,I2= 96%; FigureS7.2).
Excluding two studies where the control group received usual care (Srisuk et al.2017; Vanelderen et al.1994) affected the robustness of the effect at the short‐term follow‐up but not the substantial heterogeneity, while removing one study that had a shorter follow‐up period influenced the effect's robustness and reduced substantial heterogeneity at the long‐term follow‐up (Srisuk et al.2017).
Dyadic interventions significantly improved self‐efficacy at 1‐ to 3‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.16,p= 0.0002,I2= 73%; FigureS8.1), but were not maintained at 3‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.83, 95% CI = −0.18 to 1.83,p= 0.11,I2= 96%; FigureS8.2).
Sensitivity analyses confirmed short‐term effect robustness, while removing one study eliminated substantial heterogeneity (Ågren et al.2012).
Dyadic interventions significantly improved patients' perceived support at the 1‐ to 4‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.09–0.52,p= 0.006,I2= 0%; FigureS9.1), but not at the 2‐ to 8‐month follow‐up (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI = −0.15 to 0.39,p= 0.38,I2= 0%; FigureS9.2).
Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of both effects.
Subgroup analyses found no significant differences in perceived support outcomes with dyadic dynamic optimization strategies (TableS4).
This systematic review and meta‐analysis of dyadic interventions for promoting a healthy diet in CVD patients included 25 RCTs and 4 quasi‐experimental studies undertaken in 15 countries/regions over 33 years, involving 3039 CVD patients and 2706 informal caregivers.
Despite the growing body of dyadic research for CVD patient–caregiver dyads in recent years, this is the first known evidence evaluating the effects of dyadic interventions for promoting healthy diets among CVD patients.
Given the complexity and variety of diet‐related outcomes, this study pooled data across diet‐related behavioral, health, cognitive, and psychological outcomes.
It identified positive effects of dyadic interventions on CVD patients' sodium intake reduction (i.e., 24HUNa, self‐report dietary sodium intake, and the proportion of participants who reduced salty food intake), fat intake, BMI, quality of life (the mental component), heart disease knowledge, self‐efficacy, and perceived support.
However, this study was unable to quantitatively synthesize the effects of dyadic interventions on caregivers' outcomes due to the limited number of studies reporting caregiver‐related data.
Aligning with recommendations from health professional societies on promoting dyadic care in CVD management (e.g., the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the European Society of Cardiology) (Bakas et al.2017; McDonagh et al.2021), this study summarized study and intervention characteristics to provide insights into intervention design.
Furthermore, it specifically examined whether strategies enhancing dyadic dynamics—a key concept in dyadic care research—were associated with improved outcomes.
However, the study did not identify enhanced effects, which might be due to the small number of studies and insufficient details on interventions, leading to invalid categorization into subgroups.
This might ultimately result in inadequate statistical power to detect subgroup differences.
Given that most studies included in this review primarily involved patients with heart failure and stroke, particular dietary attention was directed toward sodium intake, a well‐established dietary risk factor that can exacerbate fluid retention, raise blood pressure, and subsequently lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes (He et al.2020).
Alarmingly, high sodium intake was responsible for approximately 3 million deaths worldwide in 2019, making it the leading dietary risk factor for deaths and DALYs globally (Afshin et al.2019).
The current meta‐analysis demonstrated that dyadic interventions effectively reduced patients' 24HUNa, a gold standard recommended by WHO to measure daily sodium intake (World Health Organization2018), with sustained beneficial effects observed from 3 to 8 months post‐intervention.
Notably, the magnitude of 24HUNa reduction (MD at 1–3 months: −566.05 mg/24 h and MD at 3–8 months: −550.27 mg/24 h) achieved through dyadic interventions surpassed that observed in prior meta‐analytic evidence focusing solely on interventions targeting individual patients without caregiver involvement (MD = −486.19 mg/24 h) (Khalesi et al.2022).
The greater sodium intake reductions yielded by dyadic interventions involving informal caregivers suggest their potential superior efficacy relative to interventions lacking informal caregiver engagement (Yan et al.2024).
This study also provides preliminary evidence suggesting that dyadic interventions effectively reduced patients' fat intake and BMI, and improved adherence to dietary self‐care behavior, with small to medium effect sizes observed at short‐term follow‐up.
Dyadic interventions, thus, represent a promising and feasible approach to enhancing dietary adherence among patients (Yan et al.2024).
However, dyadic interventions did not demonstrate significant improvements in blood lipid profiles.
One possible explanation is that clinical health outcomes, such as blood lipid profiles, typically require a longer duration before measurable improvements become apparent, compared to dietary behavior indicators such as sodium and fat intake.
Additionally, due to insufficient data, this study could not comprehensively evaluate other critical clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure and blood glucose levels.
Therefore, further trials are warranted to examine the long‐term effectiveness of dyadic interventions on diet‐related behavioral outcomes and include a broader range of clinical health indicators (Roth et al.2020).
Regarding diet‐related cognitive and psychological outcomes, this study also indicated significant improvements in patients' heart disease knowledge (SMD = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.18–2.82, large effect), self‐efficacy (SMD = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.16, medium‐to‐large effect), perceived support (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.09–0.52, small‐to‐medium effect), and quality of life (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.12–0.44, small‐to‐medium effect).
These significant findings are further supported by review studies of dyadic research among CVD patients (Bakas et al.2014; Buck et al.2018; Yu et al.2024).
However, these improvements were significant only at short‐term follow‐up and were not maintained at long‐term follow‐up.
The lack of a significant long‐term effect on heart disease knowledge could likely be attributed to the possibility that participants in the control groups also received active interventions and basic educational information (Bakas et al.2017).
Self‐efficacy is recognized as a key determinant of behavior change, such as healthy eating (Prestwich et al.2014).
A meta‐analysis reported that behavior change techniques (BCTs), such as performance feedback, social support, and stress management, significantly increased dietary self‐efficacy (Prestwich et al.2014).
In particular, patients' perceived support from informal caregivers, an important resource for improving patients' self‐efficacy (Bandura2004), should be strengthened within dyadic interventions since it can positively influence the quality of patient–caregiver interactions and their engagement in dietary behaviors (Dunbar et al.2005).
Future studies could employ these evidence‐based BCTs to enhance and even sustain dietary self‐efficacy among patients, thereby improving adherence to healthy dietary behaviors (Chan et al.2018).
A strength of this review is that this was the first known meta‐analysis to examine the effectiveness of dyadic interventions in promoting healthy diets in CVD patients.
This review ensured a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence by employing extensive search strategies to cover a broad spectrum of CVD endpoints as classified by World Health Organization (2021), dietary risk factors identified in the GBD, and dietary modifications from overall diet patterns to specific foods and nutrients (Roth et al.2020), and a range of behavioral, health, cognitive, and psychological outcomes related to healthy eating behavior.
However, this review has some limitations.
First, it only included English‐language articles, which may limit the generalizability of the findings, particularly given recent evidence highlighting the influence of cultural context on participant responses to interventions (Yu et al.2024).
Second, the reliability of some meta‐analyzed results is limited by the small number of included studies and the inconsistent effectiveness observed during sensitivity analyses.
More high‐quality, large‐scale RCTs are needed to enhance the robustness of the evidence.
Third, obtaining data assessed by various measurement tools and including different control group conditions regarding caregiver involvement may have contributed to high heterogeneity in meta‐analysis results.
Finally, insufficient description of intervention contents (e.g., dyadic dynamics strategies) and caregiver demographics limits further identification of intervention characteristics associated with enhanced effects.
Despite a substantial number of included studies, those exclusively focusing on dyadic dietary interventions were limited, reflecting insufficient attention to dyadic approaches in dietary management.
Further research dedicated to dyadic dietary interventions is needed to incorporate more diet‐related outcomes to advance understanding in this field.
Moreover, detailed reporting in dyadic trials is essential, such as including the descriptions of dyadic strategies, theoretical frameworks, and caregiver eligibility criteria, to help explore influencing factors and associated mechanisms (Bakas et al.2014; Bernard et al.2023).
This systematic review and meta‐analysis demonstrated that dyadic interventions have shown preliminary positive evidence for diet‐related outcomes among CVD patients, including sodium intake, fat intake, BMI, self‐care behavior, quality of life, heart disease knowledge, self‐efficacy, and perceived support.
However, the sustainability of meta‐analyzed results and the effects on many other diet‐related outcomes remain unclear due to insufficient data.
High‐quality and rigorous dyadic research is needed to further validate current findings, assess the effectiveness of other dietary outcomes, and explore effective intervention characteristics.
Health professionals are encouraged to actively engage informal caregivers of CVD patients and adopt dyad‐focused strategies (e.g., enhancing communication and collaboration) to optimize dyadic dynamics and improve patients' dietary adherence and related outcomes.
As the most common developers and interventionists for dyadic interventions in promoting healthy diets, nurses should address the identified research gaps when designing and delivering interventions to strengthen the evidence base in this field.
