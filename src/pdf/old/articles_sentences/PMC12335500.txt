Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, characterized by molecular heterogeneity and limited therapeutic options.
Here, we identified EPS8L2 as a novel driver of colorectal tumorigenesis.
EPS8L2 is significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and negatively correlated with patients’ prognosis.
Functionally, upregulation of EPS8L2 promotes proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, and vice versa.
Similarly, EPS8L2 overexpression promotes patient-derived organoids growth.
Mechanistically, EPS8L2 increases YBX1 phosphorylation by enhancing its interaction with phosphokinase S6K1.
Phosphorylated YBX1 translocates into nucleus and initiates G3BP2 transcription, leading to activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.
Moreover, knockout ofEps8l2impairs CRC tumorigenesis in the AOM/DSS induced mouse model.
In summary, we revealed a novel EPS8L2-YBX1-G3BP2 regulatory axis involved in CRC progression, which provides a new theoretical basis for tumor therapy.
Colorectal cancer (CRC), including both colon and rectal cancers, ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths [1].
Its pathogenesis typically initiates cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations in colonic epithelium, driving aberrant cellular proliferation and malignant transformation [2].
While early detection programs have improved 5-year survival rates, ~25% of patients present with stage IV disease at diagnosis, and an additional 25–50% of initially early-stage patients progress to metastatic CRC [3].
The prognosis of metastatic CRC patients remains poor, with a median 5-year survival rate of only 12.5% [4].
Therapeutic strategies diverge significantly by disease stage.
Surgical resection is the preferred treatment option for early-stage CRC, while advanced or recurrent CRC typically requires multidisciplinary approach, combining chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy [5].
Despite therapeutic advances, metastasis and recurrence persist as principal barriers to survival improvement.
Consequently, deciphering the molecular drivers of CRC progression and identifying specific biomarkers are critical imperatives for enhancing the prognosis of CRC patients.
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are critical transmembrane receptors responsible for transmitting extracellular signals into intracellular [6].
They regulate essential processes like cell growth, differentiation, and survival [7], making them important targets for cancer therapy [8].
Among RTK family, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is particularly well-studied in cancer.
When activated by ligands (e.g., EGF), EGFR triggers key pathways including RAS-RAF-MAPK and PI3K-AKT, which drive cancer cell proliferation and metastasis [9,10].
Therefore, exploring and understanding the functions and mechanisms of RTK-related genes remains crucial for developing better CRC treatments and understanding disease mechanisms.
EPS8, a conserved intracellular substrate of the EGFR pathway, is widely expressed across species, including humans, nematodes, and fruit flies [11].
The EPS8 protein family comprises four structurally homologous members (EPS8, EPS8L1, EPS8L2, and EPS8L3), all sharing key functional domains: an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, central SH3 domain, and C-terminal effector region [12].
Members of the EPS8 family have been widely reported to be closely associated with various cancers [13–15].
Current studies about EPS8L2 primarily focused on auditory system [16–18], where its loss causes hearing impairment [16,17].
EPS8L2 has also been reported to be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, urinary extracellular vesicle production, and nuclear movement during cell migration [19–21].
Moreover, EPS8L2 is associated with T cell activation, lupus nephritis, and diabetic erectile dysfunction [22–24].
In cancer, EPS8L2 was reported to be associated with testicular germ cell tumors’ drug resistance [25].
Additionally, high expression of EPS8L2 is a biomarker of endometrial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma [26–28].
However, the function and mechanism of EPS8L2 in CRC development remain unknown.
Here, we identified EPS8L2 was upregulated in CRC through bioinformatics analysis and CRC tissue microarray.
We found that elevated EPS8L2 expression was significantly associated with tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, and CRC patients’ poor prognosis.
Additionally, we showed that EPS8L2 promoted CRC cell proliferation and metastasis by facilitating S6K1-mediated YBX1 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation to activate G3BP2 transcription and the MAPK signaling pathway.
Furthermore,Eps8l2knockout led to decreased tumor incidence in an AOM/DSS-induced carcinogenesis model.
Altogether, this study elucidated a previously unknown biological function and mechanism of EPS8L2 in CRC, which may provide a promising treatment strategy for CRC intervention.
To explore potential regulators involved in CRC development, we compared gene expression profiles in several publicly accessible human CRC datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases.
We identified 665 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on a significant threshold of |log2FC| ≥ 0.58 andp< 0.05 (Fig.1A, B).
We then performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis using the 665 common DEGs and found that the RTK signaling was significantly enriched, such as ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (Fig.1C, D).
Therefore, we focused on RTK-related genes and analyzed their expression changes in CRC tissues compared to normal controls (Fig.1Eand Supplementary Fig.1A).
The thirty most upregulated genes in CRC tissues were analyzed, and only EPS8L2’s function in CRC remains unclear.
We therefore selected EPS8L2 for following exploration.
The upregulation of EPS8L2 mRNA and protein levels in CRC was further validated (Fig.1F–H).
We then obtained a human CRC tissue microarray (TMA) and verified that EPS8L2 was highly expressed in tumor tissues compared with paired peri-tumor tissues (Fig.1I).
In addition, EPS8L2 expression level was increased in CRC samples with III and IV clinical stages (Fig.1J) or lymph node metastasis (Fig.1Kand Supplementary Fig.1B).
Moreover, high expression of EPS8L2 was associated with poor prognosis (Fig.1Land Supplementary Fig.1C).
Conclusively, EPS8L2 is highly expressed in CRC and positively correlated with poor prognosis.

To investigate its function, stable EPS8L2 knockdown cell lines were successfully established (Fig.2A, B).
We found that EPS8L2 silencing markedly inhibited cell proliferation as shown by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay (Fig.2C, D).
Furthermore, transwell migration and wound healing assays were conducted and revealed that EPS8L2 knockdown reduced the migratory ability of HCT116 and HT29 cells (Fig.2E, F).
Interestingly, knockdown of EPS8L2 resulted in increased apoptosis (Fig.2G), which was further validated by enhanced BAX expression and downregulation of BCL2 (Fig.2H).
To explore its role in vivo, we subcutaneously implanted EPS8L2-depleted HCT116 cells into BALB/c nude mice.
The results showed that EPS8L2 knockdown significantly decreased tumor volume and weight in nude mice (Fig.2I–K).
Consistently, Ki67 expression was obviously inhibited after EPS8L2 knockdown (Fig.2L).
We then performed an in vivo metastasis assay by injecting EPS8L2 knockdown (shEPS8L2) or control (shNC) HCT116 cells into the tail vein of BALB/c nude mice.
We observed a significant reduction in liver metastatic nodules in shEPS8L2 group (Fig.2M, N).

To further confirm above findings, we generated EPS8L2-overexpressing HCT116 and SW480 cell lines (Fig.3A, B).
We found that EPS8L2 overexpression greatly enhanced the proliferation and migration capacities of HCT116 and SW480 cells in vitro (Fig.3C–F).
Importantly, the expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, MMP2 and MMP9, were also significantly upregulated after EPS8L2 overexpression (Fig.3G).
We also overexpressed EPS8L2 in RKO cells, which lacks endogenous EPS8L2 expression (Supplementary Fig.2A, B).
Consistently, EPS8L2 ectopic expression promoted RKO cell proliferation and migration in vitro (Supplementary Fig.2C–E).
Next, xenograft and in vivo metastasis assays were carried out using EPS8L2 overexpressing HCT116 cells.
The results indicated that EPS8L2 overexpression increased tumor volume and weight (Fig.3H–J).
The upregulation of EPS8L2 in tumor tissues was validated by RT-qPCR, western blotting, and IHC (Fig.3K–M).
Besides, MMP9, MMP2, and Ki67 expression levels were increased after EPS8L2 overexpression (Fig.3L, M).
Similarly, we observed a significant increase in liver metastatic nodules in the oeEPS8L2 group after injecting HCT116 cells into the tail vein (Fig.3N, O).
To further assess its preclinical relevance, we obtained fresh CRC samples and conducted patient-derived organoids (PDOs) experiments.
We found that EPS8L2 overexpression promoted organoids growth (Fig.3P).

To determine the underlying mechanism, RNA sequencing was performed using EPS8L2 knockdown HCT116 cells.
1430 DEGs were identified in shEPS8L2 cells compared to shNC groups, including 534 upregulated genes and 896 downregulated genes (Fig.4A).
Notably, several reported oncogenes were downregulated after EPS8L2 silencing, such as FOXQ1, G3BP2, ADAM8, CLDN1, and PPP1R1B [29–33].
GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these DEGs were predominantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig.4B, C).
Correlation analysis using TCGA database also revealed significant positive correlation between EPS8L2 level and activation of the MAPK or ERK signaling pathway (Fig.4D, E), suggesting that EPS8L2 may be involved in the activation of the MAPK signaling.
To confirm it, we performed western blotting and IHC assays, and found that EPS8L2 knockdown inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in CRC cell lines and tissues, and vice versa (Fig.4F–I).
Collectively, EPS8L2 activates the MAPK signaling pathway.
ADEGs between shEPS8L2 and shNC HCT116 cells were shown by volcano plot.

Scale bars, 100 μm.
To further elucidate how EPS8L2 activates MAPK signaling pathway, we performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assay to screen potential EPS8L2-interacting proteins.
The silver staining results showed a distinct differential band between 40 kDa and 55 kDa in the Flag antibody groups compared to the IgG control groups (Fig.5A).
This differential band was then subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, which identified 89 interacting proteins in HCT116 cells and 23 interacting proteins in SW480 cells (Fig.5B).
YBX1 scored high and was selected for validation (Fig.5Band Supplementary Fig.3A, B).
The interaction between EPS8L2 and YBX1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and immunofluorescence (IF) assays (Fig.5C–E).
In addition, we examined effect of YBX1 on MAPK signaling pathway.
The results showed that YBX1 knockdown significantly reduced the levels of p-MEK and p-ERK in both HCT116 and HT29 cells, and vice versa (Fig.5F).
Interestingly, it was observed that YBX1 was also highly expressed in CRC (Supplementary Fig.3C).
AThe extracted protein was precipitated with anti-Flag antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining in HCT116 and SW480 cells.BCommon proteins identified by mass spectrometry in HCT116 and SW480 cells that interact with EPS8L2 were shown by venn diagram.

YBX1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm [34,35].
However, in response to cellular stress, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, heat shock, or oxidative stress, YBX1 undergoes phosphorylation by kinases, including AKT and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, which triggers its rapid translocation into the nucleus [36,37].
Then YBX1 binds to the promoter regions of specific genes, such as p53, BCL2, and PD-L1, and facilitates their transcription [38,39].
Interestingly, we noticed that knockdown of EPS8L2 inhibited YBX1 phosphorylation (active state) without affecting its total expression, and vice versa (Fig.5G).
As EPS8L2 is not a kinase, it is imperative to explore the underlying mechanism by which EPS8L2 regulates the phosphorylation status of YBX1.
Previous research has demonstrated that the phosphorylation of YBX1 can be mediated by multiple kinases, such as S6K1 [40,41].
Really, immunoprecipitation assay revealed that knockdown of EPS8L2 significantly decreased the interaction between p-S6K1 and YBX1 (Fig.5H), suggesting that EPS8L2 facilitated the phosphorylation of YBX1 through S6K1.
Moreover, we observed a decrease in nuclear YBX1 following EPS8L2 downregulation and an increase in nuclear YBX1 after EPS8L2 upregulation (Fig.5I, J).
To further explain how EPS8L2-YBX1 axis activates MAPK signaling pathway, we utilized CUT&Tag technology to identify the direct target of YBX1 (Fig.6A).
The CUT&Tag results indicated that YBX1 binding sites were predominantly distributed in promoter regions, with 34.46% of binding sites located within 1 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) (Fig.6B).
Additionally, YBX1 exhibited higher binding peaks near both the TSS and TES in shNC group, whereas these peaks were significantly diminished in shEPS8L2 group (Fig.6C).
Next, we analyzed the data from the RNA-seq and CUT&Tag experiments jointly and took the intersection to identify the potential targets of YBX1 (Fig.6D).
15 common genes were identified and their expression levels in CRC were analyzed using the GEPIA online tool (Fig.6Dand Supplementary Fig.4A–O).
Among them, only 7 genes were upregulated in CRC (Supplementary Fig.4A–G).
Therefore, these 7 genes were selected for further investigation by RT-qPCR.
The results indicated that the RNA levels of G3BP2 in HCT116 and HT29 cells were significantly reduced following the knockdown of either EPS8L2 or YBX1 (Fig.6E–H).
Consistently, the protein levels of G3BP2 were also regulated by EPS8L2 and YBX1 in a similar manner (Fig.6I, J).

**p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001, ns no significance.
To determine whether EPS8L2-YBX1 axis directly regulates G3BP2 transcription, we analyzed the enrichment of YBX1 on G3BP2 promoter according to the CUT&Tag result and found that YBX1 enriched across the proximal promoter region (0 bp ~ −850 bp upstream of TSS) of G3BP2 while EPS8L2 knockdown significantly attenuated it (Fig.6K), indicating an EPS8L2-dependent chromatin recruitment of YBX1.
To further confirm it, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and found that YBX1 enriched on the region of −400 bp ~ −600 bp from TSS (Fig.6Land Supplementary Fig.4P).
Subsequently, we performed dual-luciferase reporter assays.
Consistently, YBX1 overexpression enhanced G3BP2 transcription activity (Fig.6M).
Besides, EPS8L2 knockdown inhibited the activity of G3BP2 luciferase reporter while YBX1 overexpression reversed it, and vice versa (Fig.6N, O).
As G3BP2 is a member of the RAS-GTPase-activating protein (G3BP) family [42] and G3BP2 is reported to activate the MAPK signaling pathway [43], we hypothesized that G3BP2 may influence the activity of MAPK signaling pathway in CRC.
Western blotting showed that the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was significantly reduced after G3BP2 knockdown and vice versa (Fig.6P).
In conclusion, EPS8L2 promotes YBX1-dependent transcription of G3BP2, leading to MAPK signaling activation.
To explore whether the ability of EPS8L2 to promote CRC cell proliferation is dependent on G3BP2, we conducted both in vitro and in vivo rescue experiments.
The results showed that EPS8L2 overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation and migration abilities of HCT116 and SW480 cells while G3BP2 knockdown reversed it, and vice versa (Fig.7A–H).
Additionally, the activation of MAPK signaling pathway induced by EPS8L2 overexpression could be reversed by G3BP2 knockdown, whereas inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway caused by EPS8L2 knockdown could be restored by G3BP2 overexpression (Fig.7I, J).
In vivo experiments showed that G3BP2 knockdown could impede increased tumor growth and tumor weight caused by EPS8L2 overexpression (Fig.7K–M).
IHC staining results showed that G3BP2 knockdown reversed EPS8L2 overexpression-induced Ki67 upregulation (Fig.7N).
Conclusively, EPS8L2 promotes CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis via G3BP2.
A–DCell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay (A, B) and colony formation assay (C, D) in the indicated CRC cells.E-HTranswell migration (E,F) and wound healing assay (G, H) were performed to assess the cell migration ability of indicated CRC cells.

To further investigate whether Eps8l2 is involved in tumorigenesis, we generatedEps8l2knockout mice (Eps8l2−/−) and wild-type littermates (Eps8l2+/+) to induce colorectal cancer (Fig.8A).
We confirmed the deletion of Eps8l2 in the colorectal tissues ofEps8l2knockout mice (Fig.8B).
We observed that the length of colons fromEps8l2-/-mice was longer than that inEps8l2+/+mice after induction (Fig.8C, D), suggesting an alleviated inflammation afterEps8l2deletion.
In addition, the number of colorectal tumors inEps8l2−/−mice was significantly reduced compared with that inEps8l2+/+mice (Fig.8E, F).
Moreover, tumor size was also decreased afterEps8l2knockout (Fig.8G).
Consistently, H&E staining revealed low-grade dysplasia in the colon tissues from Eps8l2-/-mice (Fig.8H).
To determine whether the Eps8l2-G3bp2 axis contributes to tumor development in this AOM/DSS model, we examined G3bp2 and Ki67 expression by IHC staining and found a significant decrease of G3bp2 and Ki67 expression levels in tumor tissues fromEps8l2−/−mice (Fig.8I).
The levels of p-Mek and p-Erk were significantly reduced inEps8l2−/−tumors (Fig.8J).
Taken together, these data indicate that EPS8L2 is a pivot oncogene involved in CRC progression.

More importantly, EPS8L2 can enhance the interaction between YBX1 and its kinase p-S6K1, leading to the increase of YBX1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, promoting the transcription of downstream G3BP2 and activating the MAPK signaling pathway.

Colorectal cancer persists as a leading cause of global cancer mortality, with American Cancer Society (ACS) data in 2024 reporting approximately 153,000 new cases and 53,000 deaths annually in the US alone [1].
The pathogenesis of CRC is characterized by a complex interplay of multistep genetic and epigenetic alterations, coupled with dysregulation of the tumor microenvironment, which collectively drive malignant progression [44,45].
In this study, we identified EPS8L2 as a significantly upregulated gene in CRC tumor tissues, where it exhibits oncogenic properties.
Clinical correlation analysis revealed that elevated EPS8L2 expression is associated with advanced tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, and unfavorable patient prognosis, suggesting its potential role in CRC progression and aggressiveness.
Functional characterization of EPS8L2 revealed its critical role in promoting CRC progression.
Furthermore, utilizing patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids as a clinically relevant model system, we demonstrated that EPS8L2 overexpression markedly enhanced organoid formation efficiency, reinforcing its functional role in promoting tumorigenic capacity.
Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that EPS8L2 overexpression significantly enhanced proliferative and metastatic capacities of CRC cells.
Conversely, knockout of Eps8l2 markedly attenuated tumor development in an AOM/DSS-induced CRC mouse model.
Collectively, our findings position EPS8L2 as both a potential diagnostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for colorectal cancer intervention.
Interestingly, we observed that EPS8L2 exerts more significant oncogenic effects in vivo, which could be attributed to the following factor.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo provides complex cell-cell interactions, extracellular matrix components, and immune modulation that are absent in vitro.
EPS8L2 may enhance tumor growth by influencing stromal crosstalk and angiogenesis, or reshaping the immune microenvironment in vivo.
Secondly, the longer duration and systemic action of EPS8L2 in vivo resulted in a more significant cumulative effect of its tumorigenic activity compared to short-term in vitro experiments.
Therefore, it will be worthwhile to explore the relationship of EPS8L2 with the tumor microenvironment and tumor immunity.
MAPK signaling cascade serves as a central regulator of essential cellular processes, governing proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, and programmed cell death.
This highly conserved signaling pathway operates through sequential phosphorylation events mediated by a three-tiered kinase module: MAPKKK, MEK, and MAPK [46].
Pathological dysregulation of the MAPK cascade constitutes a fundamental driver of oncogenesis, with particular relevance to colorectal carcinogenesis.
In CRC, constitutive activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling axis has been mechanistically linked to multiple malignant phenotypes, including sustained tumor proliferation, metastatic dissemination, and the development of therapeutic resistance [47,48].
Integrative analysis of transcriptomic sequencing data and correlation studies revealed a significant association between EPS8L2 and MAPK signaling pathway activation in CRC.
Functional characterization demonstrated that EPS8L2 serves as a potent activator of MAPK signaling, mechanistically contributing to CRC progression and metastatic dissemination through this oncogenic pathway.
YBX1, a multifunctional transcription factor, regulates critical processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [38,49].
Emerging evidence has established YBX1 as a multifunctional oncoprotein contributing to tumorigenesis across multiple cancer types [50–52].
Notably, S6K1-mediated phosphorylation facilitates YBX1 nuclear translocation, thereby activating PD-L1 transcriptional upregulation in HCC [40].
So, we identified YBX1 as a novel interaction partner of EPS8L2 that mediates MAPK pathway activation.
Second, we demonstrated that EPS8L2 facilitates the formation of a molecular complex between YBX1 and its activating kinase p-S6K1, thereby promoting YBX1 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation.
However, there is a limitation about above conclusion.
We did not perform fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to dynamically monitor YBX1 nuclear accumulation in response to EPS8L2 modulation.
Thus, the observed accumulation of YBX1 may also be caused by other factors rather than nuclear translocation, which needs to be defined in the future.
G3BP2, a conserved RNA-binding protein within the RAS-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein (G3BPs) family [42], plays established roles in tumorigenesis and inflammatory diseases [30,42].
Our CUT&Tag analysis revealed that G3BP2 is co-regulated downstream of EPS8L2 and YBX1.
Previous study reported that G3BP2 may function as an oncogene in CRC [53].
Another study indicated that G3BP2 could enhance radioresistance of colorectal cancer cells [54].
Our functional studies demonstrated that G3BP2 knockdown significantly attenuated EPS8L2-driven proliferative and metastatic phenotypes.
Moreover, knockdown of G3BP2 effectively suppressed EPS8L2-mediated tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that G3BP2 is a critical downstream effector of EPS8L2 in cancer progression.
Notably, these findings align with prior reports that G3BP2 depletion impairs MAPK signaling activation in MCF7 cells, implying a conserved mechanistic role of G3BP2 in oncogenic pathway regulation [43].
Our mechanistic investigations revealed that knockdown of G3BP2 effectively abolished MAPK pathway activation induced by EPS8L2 overexpression, and vice versa.
These findings establish G3BP2 as an essential molecular effector in EPS8L2-driven oncogenic transformation.
In conclusion, our study establishes EPS8L2 as a critical oncogenic driver in colorectal cancer progression and metastasis.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that EPS8L2 physically interacts with YBX1 and promotes its nuclear accumulation through phosphorylation-dependent regulation, consequently enhancing G3BP2 transcription and activating the MAPK signaling pathway.
Importantly, genetic ablation of Eps8l2 significantly attenuated tumor development in the AOM/DSS-induced CRC model.
These findings collectively identify the EPS8L2-YBX1-G3BP2 signaling axis as a novel and potentially targetable pathway for CRC therapeutic intervention.
