Healthcare workers (HCWs) in conflict and post-conflict settings are particularly susceptible to psychological distress due to persistent occupational stress and limited systemic support.
This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among HCWs in Kabul, Afghanistan, in the wake of the political changes in August 2021.
A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from September to October 2021 in 16 public tertiary hospitals in Kabul.
The Afghan Symptoms Checklist (ASCL) was used to assess psychological distress and its related symptoms.
Multivariable analysis using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was performed to find the associated factors of psychological distress utilizing STATA 18.
A total of 277 HCWs participated in the study, with 48.4% identifying as female.
Approximately 62% had considered leaving Afghanistan, and 64% had witnessed colleagues emigrate.
The overall prevalence of psychological distress was 25% (CI 95%: 19.9–30.6), with stress-induced reactivity as the most prevalent symptom (35%, CI 95%: 29.8–41.4).
Female HCWs were significantly more likely to report sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress (POR = 2.32, CI 95%: 1.07–5.02,p= 0.03) and stress-induced reactivity (POR = 2.56, CI 95%: 1.22–5.44,p= 0.013).
A lack of optimism about the future was associated with higher odds of stress-induced reactivity (POR = 3.14, CI 95%: 1.55–6.38,p= 0.001), ruminative sadness without withdrawal (POR = 3.05, CI 95%: 1.68–6.24,p= 0.002), and sadness with withdrawal and somatic distress (POR = 3.73, CI 95%: 1.71–8.13,p= 0.001).
One in four HCWs reported psychological distress, with stress-induced reactivity being the most common symptom.
Female gender and pessimism about the future were key associated factors of elevated distress.
The findings highlight the critical need for long-term mental health support programs specifically designed for HCWs, broader support within the health system, and continued research into how HCWs cope and build resilience.

Conflicts pose considerable threats to public health, disrupting access to essential services and exposing populations to physical danger, trauma, displacement, and prolonged insecurity [1].
Approximately one-quarter of the global population currently lives in conflict-affected regions [2].
Mental health consequences in these settings are particularly severe, with disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, depression, and anxiety commonly observed [3].
A meta-analysis estimated that 22.1% of individuals living in conflict-affected areas experience mental health problems at any point in time [4].
Five decades of conflict along with political instabilities and economic hardships shaped the Afghanistan’s healthcare system.
Challenged with double burden of infectious [5] and non-communicable diseases [6], chronic underfunding [7] and critical shortage of health workers [8,9] exacerbated the circumstances of already-affected health system of Afghanistan.
Despite the concerns on mental health challenges, competing emergencies in Afghanistan made it underprioritized [10] with the varying magnitude of psychological distress falling in the range of 20–78% of psychological distress, depending on population and setting [11,12,13,14].
Healthcare workers (HCWs) in conflict and post-conflict settings are particularly at risk for psychological distress, anxiety, and depression, owing to the combination of high workplace demands and limited resources [15,16].
These mental health issues have serious implications for quality of care, leading to increased risk of medical errors, reduced patient engagement, and a diminished commitment to the profession [17,18].
A study conducted among frontline healthcare providers in Afghanistan in 2018 reported that 14–64% experienced work-related symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, feelings of failure, lack of concentration, and psychosomatic complaints [19].
Furthermore, findings of a study conducted in Herat province of Afghanistan on HCWs indicate that 73% of them reported depression symptoms with monthly income having major impact on depression [20].
Studies from other conflict-affected regions corroborate these findings.
In Myanmar, Uganda, and the Gaza Strip, healthcare providers have reported significant levels of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and general psychological distress in response to violence, insecurity, and systemic breakdowns [21,22,23].
In mid-August 2021, the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan, marking a dramatic shift in the nation’s political landscape.
This transition was characterized by the sudden withdrawal of international forces, the collapse of state institutions, and the mass emigration of Afghan citizens, including healthcare professionals.
These abrupt changes significantly altered the sociopolitical environment, generating widespread uncertainty, fear, and psychological strain across sectors.
Healthcare workers were no exception, experiencing disruptions to their work environments, professional networks, and personal lives.
While the longstanding vulnerabilities of Afghanistan’s health system and recognized mental health outcomes of HCWs in conflict settings are evident, the recent political shifts in Afghanistan during mid-August 2021 and takeover of the Taliban brought new uncertainties and stressors.
This upheaval, which likely compounded the existing challenges, affected the health system inevitably.
Despite the recent study conducted in Herat province [20], which captured responses during a more stabilized phase, the immediate aftermath of this political shift remained unexplored.
This study was conducted to address this gap by evaluating the prevalence of psychological distress among public healthcare workers in Kabul following the political transition in 2021, prior to resumption of external funding and immediately after the transition.
The study also aimed to describe their occupational realities during this period and explore factors associated with specific dimensions of psychological distress.
These insights are essential for informing targeted interventions and mental health policy reforms that support the sustainability and resilience of Afghanistan’s healthcare workforce.
This cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare workers in 16 public tertiary hospitals across Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, during the period from September to October 2021.
The study population included all clinical personnel delivering direct healthcare services, whereas administrative and support staff were excluded.
The total number of healthcare workers in these facilities was retrieved through the Human Resources Information Management System (HRMIS) of the Ministry of Public Health, serving as the sampling frame for this study.
Sample size estimation was based on Cochran’s formula, considering the estimated prevalence of psychological distress in the general population in Afghanistan, reported to range from 73 to 78%, with a 95% confidence level (z-score = 1.96) [11].
The final calculated sample size was 288.
Proportional allocation was used to distribute this sample across the 16 hospitals.
A simple random sampling method was applied within each hospital using attendance sheets as the sampling frame, and random numbers were generated using Open Epi®software.
Trained data collectors introduced the study individually to selected participants and obtained both verbal and written informed consent.
Verbal consent was obtained to ensure the participants’ understanding from study objectives, their insights, and their rights while the written consent was for recording and formalizing purposes.
Participants were given the option to complete the self-administered questionnaire during their workday or take it home and return the completed form to designated focal points in each facility.
Of the 288 questionnaires distributed, 277 were returned, resulting in a response rate of 96%.
Psychological distress symptoms were measured using the Afghan Symptoms Checklist (ASCL), a culturally grounded tool developed to assess mental health in Afghanistan [24].
The ASCL comprises 23 items that capture both Western psychiatric constructs and culturally specific expressions of distress.
These include terms familiar to local languages and idioms of distress such asjigar khun(with literal meaning of “liver blood” describes a form of sadness with grief following an interpersonal loss or a reaction to deeply disappointing or painful experience),asabi(a term describing feeling nervous or highly stressed),fishar bala(a term referring to an internal state of emotional pressure and agitation), andfishar payin(a term describing low energy and motivation).
The latter two idioms are misinterpreted locally with high blood pressure, however, they are unrelated to blood pressure and reflect mental states.
These expressions reflect experiences of grief, emotional agitation, and energy loss that are salient in the Afghan cultural context.
A pilot study was conducted among 5% of the total sample to assess the internal consistency of the ASCL in the local setting and target population of healthcare workers, yielding a high Cronbach’s alpha of 0.936.
Given the strong reliability, data from the pilot group were included in the final analysis.
The ASCL identifies three factors based on its validated structure: (1) sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress (impaired psychosocial and somatic activities), (2) ruminative sadness without social withdrawal and somatic distress (depressive symptoms and unwanted intrusive thoughts), and (3) stress-induced reactivity (nervous agitation and reactivity).
The first factor includes symptoms such as dysphoria, fatigue, and social isolation and the second factor is characterized by persistent depressive thoughts and rumination without associated somatic symptoms.
The third factor reflects agitation and nervous reactivity in response to stress.
Multiple ASCL items contribute to the scoring of each symptom dimension (Table1).
The collected data were entered into Microsoft Excel and exported to STATA 18 and IBM SPSS Version 26 for analysis.
Univariate analysis were performed by IBM SPSS Version 26, while the STATA 18 software was used specifically for the analysis of Prevalence Odds Ratio (POR) using Generalized Linear Model (GLM).
ASCL scores ranged from 23 to 115 and the total of obtained ASCL score was used to show the psychological distress level.
Due to absence of literature and a standard cut-off for the ASCL scoring criteria, the 75th percentile of the totaled ASCL score was used, with scores falling beyond 75th percentile indicating moderate or high level of psychological distress whereas, score below this cut-off was considered low levels of psychological distress (see Additional File1).
Symptom-specific prevalence estimates were similarly calculated using the ASCL-defined factor structure.
Confidence intervals at the 95% level were computed for all prevalence estimates.
To identify correlates of psychological distress and its symptom dimensions, GLM were fitted using a binomial distribution and logit link function.
PORs were estimated for key sociodemographic and occupational variables with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
The final sample comprised 277 healthcare workers from public tertiary hospitals in Kabul.
The sex distribution was nearly balanced, with females representing 48.4% of respondents (Table2).
Totally, 100 (36.1%) of the healthcare workers were in the age category of 30–39 years, followed by 96 (34.7%) in the category of 20–29 years old.
A majority of the sample 175 (63.5%) were non-medical doctor healthcare professionals, including nurses, midwives, and allied health workers.
More than half of the participants (54.9%) reported not receiving their salaries on time during the study period, and a substantial majority (91.7%) identified as the primary breadwinner for their families.
Psychosocial and migration-related factors were also notable.
Nearly two-thirds of healthcare workers (62.4%) indicated they were considering emigration, and 64.5% reported witnessing the departure of professional colleagues from Afghanistan during the two weeks preceding the survey.
Additionally, 44.4% of respondents expressed a lack of optimism about their future in the country.
The overall prevalence of psychological distress among the study sample was 25% (95% CI: 19.9–30.6).
Among the distress symptom dimensions, stress-induced reactivity was the most commonly reported (35%, 95% CI: 30.0–41.4), followed by ruminative sadness without social withdrawal and somatic distress (28%, 95% CI: 22.8–33.8).
The lowest prevalence was observed for sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress (27%, 95% CI: 22.1–33.2) (see Additional File2).
Stress-induced reactivity was more prevalent among married respondents (36.7%, 95% CI: 29.4–44.4), those who did not receive their salaries on time (41.1%, 95% CI: 32.6–49.8), and healthcare workers who reported using tobacco products (71.4%, 95% CI: 47.8–88.7).
Ruminative sadness without social withdrawal and somatic distress was more frequent among participants expressing a desire to leave the country (36.5%, 95% CI: 29.2–44.2) and those lacking optimism about their future (43.7%, 95% CI: 34.6–53.1).
This symptom was also prevalent among those who reported using medication to manage psychological distress (42.6%, 95% CI: 31.3–54.6).
Sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress was observed in 31.8% of female respondents (95% CI: 23.8–40.5), 44.6% of those using medication for distress (95% CI: 33.1–56.6), 42.7% of those expressing pessimism about the future (95% CI: 33.6–52.2), and 31.1% of those who witnessed the expatriation of colleagues (95% CI: 24.3–38.7).
Multivariable analysis using Generalized Linear Models revealed that female healthcare workers had significantly higher odds of reporting stress-induced reactivity (POR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.22–5.44,p= 0.013) and sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress (POR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.07–5.02,p= 0.03) (Table3).
Married individuals also had greater odds of experiencing stress-induced reactivity (POR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.21–5.16,p= 0.014), as did those using medication for mental health (POR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.21–5.45,p= 0.014).
Healthcare workers who expressed an intention to leave Afghanistan had significantly higher odds of reporting sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress (POR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.12–6.29,p= 0.025) and ruminative sadness without social withdrawal and somatic distress (POR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.22–6.15,p= 0.014).
Participants who expressed pessimism about their future showed markedly higher odds across all three symptom domains: stress-induced reactivity (POR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.55–6.38,p= 0.001), ruminative sadness without social withdrawal (POR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.48–6.24,p= 0.002), and sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress (POR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.71–8.13,p= 0.001).
This study highlights a significant burden of psychological distress among healthcare workers in Kabul, with one in four participants reporting clinically relevant symptoms in the immediate aftermath of the August 2021 political transition.
Stress-induced reactivity emerged as the most prevalent symptom, followed by ruminative sadness without social withdrawal and somatic distress, and sadness with social withdrawal and somatic distress.
The intention to leave the country was reported by a substantial proportion of healthcare workers and was significantly associated with psychological distress, echoing findings from other conflict settings.
Gender disparities also emerged, with female healthcare workers experiencing significantly higher odds of both stress-induced reactivity and sadness with social withdrawal and somatic symptoms.
Lack of optimism about the future was a consistent associated factor of all psychological distress symptoms.
These findings reflect both the psychosocial strain experienced by healthcare workers and the broader context of fear, uncertainty, and systemic instability.
The results align with global evidence from conflict and post-conflict settings, where high levels of psychological distress have been consistently documented among healthcare providers [25].
The stress-induced reactivity observed in this study, characterized by heightened nervousness, irritability, and emotional volatility, is consistent with findings from Yemen, where healthcare workers described ongoing exposure to war-related trauma as undermining their sense of professional efficacy and emotional resilience [26].
Similarly, healthcare workers in Gaza continued to report severe mental health symptoms two years after the end of active hostilities, underscoring the long-lasting psychological toll of political instability [27].
In Myanmar, a post-conflict study among healthcare providers identified significant sources of stress and psychological vulnerability related to both direct trauma and systemic uncertainty [21].
Comparable prevalence rates of anxiety and depression have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where 22% of medical residents showed post-war symptoms of psychological distress [28], and among Sri Lankan nurses caring for conflict victims, where prevalence rates were estimated at 21% [29].
The distress prevalence found in this study is lower than estimates from conflict-affected Libya, where extreme levels of psychological strain were reported among health personnel [30].
Variations in prevalence may reflect differences in timing, exposure levels, political context, and access to support services [31].
The factor of intention of HCWs to leave the country found in this study is consistent with other findings in the conflict setting.
A national survey of hospitals in Uganda revealed that 46% of healthcare professionals were considering exiting the sector or emigrating, although this proportion was lower than observed in this Afghan sample [22].
In Nigeria, the emigration intent among healthcare workers was found to be even higher, exceeding Afghanistan’s figures by 1.5 times [32].
These findings reinforce the role of systemic fragility and perceived professional insecurity in fueling mental health deterioration and workforce attrition.
Affected by chronic war, Afghan women face multifaceted challenges with multiple factors triggering their susceptibility towards mental health issues [33].
Factors such as Gender-based Violence, forced marriages, traditional customs and practices [34], limited learning and skill-building opportunities [35], exacerbated with severe political instability, poverty, hunger, and inconsistent governmental policies which practically reduce the women contribution [36] contribute to the poor mental health status of Afghan women.
Built on the contextual factors and gender norms in Afghanistan, findings of this study indicate higher odds of psychological distress among females, aligning with other relevant results among Afghan women [37,38].
In addition, the elucidated pattern is consistent with prior studies highlighting gender-based vulnerability in conflict zones, where women often face compounded stressors linked to caregiving responsibilities, workplace discrimination, and sociocultural expectations.
The intersection of gender and insecurity appears to amplify emotional strain and reduce perceived coping capacity.
As an associated factor, lack of optimism about the emphasizes the importance of hope and perceived agency as protective psychological factors.
Insecurity about job stability, national governance, and personal safety may erode healthcare workers’ morale and fuel feelings of helplessness, thereby exacerbating mental health symptoms.
Despite the limitations encountered during the study implementation, the study offers valuable insights into the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers in a fragile, post-conflict environment.
The findings of this study present a unique and a rarely documented scenario of HCWs response immediately after the rapid systematic changes, which can help the policy makers integrate plans for such unforeseen circumstances.
Furthermore, It underscores the urgent need for sustainable mental health infrastructure tailored to the specific stressors encountered by health personnel.
Organizational support systems, policy-level reforms, and targeted psychosocial interventions will be critical in preventing burnout, improving resilience, and retaining the health workforce in Afghanistan.
Furthermore, its recommended to expand the structure of tertiary hospitals to recruit psychosocial officers as official personnel of the hospital, benefiting from the public budget allocated for the hospitals.
This initiative would improve the feasibility of seeking for psychosocial support in the hospital-level with no out-of-pocket expenses for the HCWs of the tertiary hospitals.
Future research should include longitudinal assessments to track mental health outcomes over time and evaluate changes in distress as political and institutional conditions evolve.
Moreover, studies focusing on resilience-building strategies, social support networks, and coping mechanisms among Afghan HCWs could inform culturally grounded mental health interventions and policy development.
Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged.
First, data collection was limited to public tertiary hospitals in Kabul, excluding private healthcare facilities and rural or community-level health centers.
However, it’s noteworthy to mention that the current findings highlight the pattern and burden of psychological distress after a nation-wide political transition, which was not limited to Kabul, hence extending the generalizability of the findings.
Furthermore, the cadres included in this study make the core public health workforce backbone of the country, hence reflecting the representativeness of the HCWs in this study.
On the other hand, the selected hospitals for this study serve as referral hub for the complicated cases from across the country and serve for disproportionate patient loads, particularly during instabilities, which often represent system-wide norms in clinical practice and coping behaviors.
Therefore, with the acknowledgement of institutional and geographical limitation, systematic exposure, occupational composition, and high patient loads support the relevance of our findings to similar public-sector healthcare context across the country.
Second, the descriptive nature of the study precludes causal inferences and does not allow for exploration of underlying mechanisms driving psychological distress.
Third, the study was conducted during a sensitive political period, and participants may have been reluctant to fully disclose their mental health concerns, introducing potential response bias.
Lastly, the high rate of professional emigration in the immediate post-transition period may have introduced selection bias, as those most affected may have already exited the workforce.
The current study presents empirical evidence on the levels of psychological distress symptoms in the aftermath of the political transition of the mid-August 2021.
Findings of this study reveal that one in four healthcare workers reported clinically relevant distress, and stress-induced reactivity emerging as the main dimension of the psychological distress symptoms.
Female gender, marital status, medication use, tobacco consumption, pessimism about the future, and intentions to emigrate were significantly associated with elevated psychological distress, highlighting the multifactorial nature of vulnerability in this context.
This study which presents a unique landscape of vulnerability in context of health system and HCWs provides an insight into rapid mental response of HCWs toward unprecedented situations.
These findings underscore the urgent need for integrated, facility-level mental health support and long-term policy measures to strengthen HCW resilience in fragile settings like Afghanistan.
