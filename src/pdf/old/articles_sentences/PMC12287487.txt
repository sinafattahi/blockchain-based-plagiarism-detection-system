We established a reliable high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detector (HPLC‐UV) method to simultaneously quantify and compare four indicator components in Kunlun Chrysanthemum (Coreopsis tinctoriaNutt.
), Jiajin Chrysanthemum (C.
tinctoriaNutt.)
and Chrysanthemum buds (C.
tinctoriaNutt.).
We also aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of them in vitro.
We showed that chlorogenic acid, 3,5‐Odicaffeoylquinic acid, and Quercitrin concentrations were highest in Jiajin Chrysanthemum; Luteolin was highest in Chrysanthemum buds, and the four components were at an intermediate level in Kunlun Chrysanthemum.
Antioxidant activity demonstrated IC50values for DPPH free radical scavenging of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Snow Chrysanthemum buds of 1.20, 1.33, and 2.41 mg/mL, respectively.
The IC50values for ABTS radical scavenging were 2.53, 2.43, and 3.38 mg/mL, respectively.
It showed differences in the four active ingredients of Snow Chrysanthemums from different origins and harvesting times.
This HPLC‐UV method accurately and rapidly determined the four active ingredients in Snow Chrysanthemums simultaneously, which may provide a quality control reference for Snow Chrysanthemums.
Future studies exploring specific differences in cultivation, climate, harvesting, and drying of Snow Chrysanthemums to optimize its chemical composition would assist in developing its potential as a natural plant resource in health care.
Snow Chrysanthemum is a plant, native to North America, which is widely planted in the Kunlun Mountains of Hotan, China, at an altitude of over 3000 m. The flowering period is short, from June to August each year, and the Snow Chrysanthemum blooms only once.
The head‐shaped inflorescence of Snow Chrysanthemum is called “Kunlun Chrysanthemum” and has been used as a folk herb by Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China for hundreds of years (Jing et al.2016; Wang et al.2015).
In 2010, Kunlun Chrysanthemum was introduced to the Jiajin Mountain area of Sichuan, which has a similar altitude and planting environment to the Kunlun Mountain area of Hetan.
The harvested flower heads are called “Jiajin Chrysanthemum”.
The Snow Chrysanthemums sold at local markets have two harvesting periods: the full flowering period and the bud period.
Kunlun Chrysanthemum and Jiajin Chrysanthemum are both harvested during the full flowering period when the petals are completely spread out, while Chrysanthemum buds are harvested during the bud stage when the petals have broken through the bracts but have not yet extended (Figure1).

According to the “Illustrated Catalogue of Chinese Zhuang Medicine”, the two‐color golden chicken Chrysanthemum is able to clear heat and dampness toxins, and is mainly used for treating redness, swelling, pain, ulcers, and toxins (Zhu and Dai2020).
Although Snow Chrysanthemum does not belong to the category of tea, it can be drunk as tea and its magical color, aroma, and taste compare well to various precious tea leaves, delighting tea lovers.
A few chrysanthemums in the water bloom in the cup, gradually darkening, like a dynamic painting; with a fragrant smell, sweetness in the mouth, immediately and as an aftertaste, with a lingering fragrance on the lips and teeth.
It is beneficial in clearing and nourishing the liver, improving vision, nourishing yin, beautifying and nourishing the skin, moisturizing the intestines and promoting bowel movements.
Compared with ordinary chrysanthemums, Snow Chrysanthemums have higher medicinal value, with isolation and extraction of flavonoids, phenolic acids, polysaccharides, saponins, and other substances.
Flavonoids, including quercetin and luteolin, have multiple biological activities, including antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, anti‐tumor, lipid‐lowering, and hypoglycemic effects (Dias et al.2012; Jiang, Le, Liu, et al.2016; Jiang, Le, Zhai, et al.2016; Li et al.2014; Xie et al.2009; Yang et al.2014).
Phenolic acid substances, including chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid A (3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid), have antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities (Jiang et al.2018).
The main active ingredients in Snow Chrysanthemum are flavonoids and polyphenols (Tian et al.2018; Zhang et al.2016), but their content is known to vary depending on significant differences in growth altitude, planting environment, and cultivation measures in different regions, relating to differences in climate, soil composition, sunshine duration, and agricultural technology.
Therefore, even the same variety of Snow Chrysanthemum, from different regions, may show variation in chemical composition and pharmacological effects, medicinal value, and health benefits.
The timing of harvesting of Snow Chrysanthemums, as for other medicinal plants, may decisively affect efficacy, but also consumer acceptance and the market value of the product.
Determining the optimal harvesting period is therefore one of the key steps in ensuring the quality of medicinal materials; usually requiring comprehensive consideration of the plant's growth cycle, climatic conditions, and the accumulation pattern of active ingredients.
Using scientific methods to determine the optimal harvesting time maximizes the content of the effective ingredients, thereby improving the overall quality and efficacy of medicinal plant materials.
The aim of this study was to develop an advanced method for simultaneous determination of four key active ingredients (including chlorogenic acid, 3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercitrin, and luteolin) in Snow Chrysanthemum using HPLC‐UV.
Precise quantitative analysis and comparison of these four important components in Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds aim to provide a scientific basis for the differences in active ingredients in these different forms of Snow Chrysanthemums, laying a solid foundation for further exploring the pharmacological effects and potential applications in food and medicine.
We aimed to determine the antioxidant activity of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds to provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for the scientific therapeutic application of Snow Chrysanthemums.

The theoretical plate number of the chromatographic column is above 80,000, and the tailing factor is 1.01.
DPPH free radicals are widely used for in vitro antioxidant evaluation; antioxidant capacity was evaluated by measuring the ability of the sample to scavenge DPPH free radicals.
Five milligrams of DPPH was accurately weighed, diluted to a volume of 250 mL with 75% ethanol solution, and stored in the dark for future use.
Two milliliters of test Solution II was accurately measured containing different mass concentrations; 2 mL of DPPH was added, shaken thoroughly, and reacted at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.

The absorbance measured using 75% ethanol instead of DPPH solution was A2.
The absorbance measured using 75% ethanol instead of Snow Chrysanthemum extract was A0.
Each sample was measured three times, and the average was taken to calculate the clearance percentage.
The positive control was the commonly used vitamin C (VC) solution.
An appropriate amount of VC was accurately weighed, and a solution containing 2.0 mg VC per mL was prepared with 75% ethanol and diluted to obtain positive control solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL (Song et al.2016).
whereA0represents the absorbance of the blank group (DPPH solution without the antioxidant sample);A1is the absorbance of the sample group (DPPH solution with the antioxidant sample); andA2is the absorbance of the control group (sample solution without DPPH solution).
The ABTS free radical scavenging ability method is commonly used to determine antioxidant capacity of food, drug, health product, and cosmetic samples.
Measuring the absorbance changes before and after the reaction between the sample and ABTS free radicals allows the antioxidant capacity of the sample to be calculated.
A measured volume of ABTS solution (7 mmol/L) containing potassium persulfate solution (140 mmol/L) was left at room temperature in the dark overnight to prepare ABTS stock solution.
The ABTS working solution was diluted using anhydrous ethanol to obtain an absorbance value of 0.70 ± 0.002 at 30°C and 734 nm wavelength; 3.9 mL of ABTS working solution was mixed with 0.1 mL of test Solution II, shaken thoroughly for 10 s, and allowed to stand for 6 min for reaction.

Each sample was tested three times, and the average value was taken to calculate the clearance percentage.
The positive control was VC solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL, prepared as above (Qiu et al.2015).
whereA0represents the absorbance of the blank group, andA1is the absorbance of the sample to be tested.
The IC50(half maximal inhibitory concentration) was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of the compounds; calculated as the compound concentration required to achieve 50% clearance of free radicals in the DPPH and ABTS assays.
The data are presented in the form of mean ± standard deviation.
SPSS 19.0 one‐way ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons, with a significance level ofp< 0.05.
The linearity of the detector response was determined according to the calibration chart.
Study standard solutions for linear testing were prepared from reserve solutions with a gradient of six concentrations.
Regression analysis was employed to evaluate the linearity of the analysis method.
In the regression equation Y = aX + b, “X” corresponds to the concentration of the standard solution (mg/mL), “Y” corresponds to the peak area, “a” is the slope of the line, and “b” is the intercept of the line on the y‐axis.
Calibration curves were constructed with correlation coefficients (r2) exceeding 0.9996 for all four reference standards, indicating an excellent relationship between peak area and the concentration of the four indicator components over the concentration range.
In HPLC analysis, the limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest detectable amount of analyte above the baseline noise level (usually signal to noise ratio [S/N] = 3), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) is defined as the lowest reproducible amount of analyte above the baseline noise level (usually S/N = 10 or higher) (Wang et al.2008).
Standard solutions were diluted with 70% methanol to obtain the appropriate concentrations.
In this study, the injection volume was 10 μL, and the LOD and LOQ of the four indicator components were 0.001–0.003 mg/mL and 0.002–0.012 mg/mL, respectively (Table2).

The results are shown in Table3.
The RSD range of peak area was 0.35%–3.17%, indicating that test solutions had good stability over at least 24 h.
Repeatability refers to the consistency of results obtained from multiple measurements of the same sample under the same conditions.
Six test solutions of sample No. 1 were prepared and measured under the same experimental conditions.
The results are shown in Table3.
The RSD range of peak area was 1.31%–2.19%, indicating good repeatability of the method.
Sample recovery was determined by spiking six samples with specified amounts of chlorogenic acid, 3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercitrin, and luteolin as reference substances.
Test solutions were prepared according to the above methods and analyzed by HPLC to calculate sample recovery.
The results are shown in Table3.
The average recovery rate ranged from 103.0% to 104.7%, with RSD ranging from 2.93% to 4.81%.
Our established methods accurately and rapidly determined four active ingredients in the samples simultaneously.
The results are shown in Figure2, illustrating the overlay of chromatograms for seven batches of samples and controls.
The chromatograms clearly distinguished the four indicator components, with retention times of 12.9 min for chlorogenic acid (Peak A), 50.5 min for 3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid (Peak B), 59.6 min for quercitrin (Peak C), and 74 min for luteolin (Peak D).
The well‐resolved peaks and consistent retention times, across the different samples, confirm the robustness of the method.

Clearance % indicates the ability to eliminate free radicals, with higher values reflecting greater antioxidant capacity.
The results of DPPH radical scavenging percentage showed that within the concentration range of 0.1–2.0 mg/mL, with the increase of mass concentration, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds increased markedly, and were lower than that of VC at the same concentration.
The IC50of Kunlun Chrysanthemum was 1.20 mg/mL, that of Jiajin Chrysanthemum was 1.33 mg/mL, and for Chrysanthemum buds was 2.41 mg/mL.
There was no statistically significant difference between Kunlun Chrysanthemum and Jiajin Chrysanthemum (p> 0.05), although there were significant differences between Chrysanthemum buds and Kunlun Chrysanthemum (p< 0.05), and between Chrysanthemum buds and Jiajin Chrysanthemum (p< 0.05).
These results are shown in Figure5.

Within the concentration range of 0.2–0.8 mg/mL, Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds showed a significant increase in ABTS radical scavenging percentage, which was lower than that of VC.
At concentrations above 0.8 mg/mL, the clearance by Kunlun Chrysanthemum and of Jiajin Chrysanthemum and Chrysanthemum buds remained flat (Figure4B).
The IC50of Kunlun Chrysanthemum was 2.53 mg/mL, that of Jiajin Chrysanthemum was 2.43 mg/mL, and for Chrysanthemum buds was 3.38 mg/mL.
There was no significant difference between Kunlun Chrysanthemum and Jiajin Chrysanthemum (p> 0.05), although there were statistically significant differences between Chrysanthemum buds and Kunlun Chrysanthemum (p< 0.05), and between Chrysanthemum buds and Jiajin Chrysanthemum (p< 0.05).
The results are shown in Figure5.
To further explore the variation among sample batches, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the chemical profiles of the 21 samples (Table4).
The PCA score plot (Figure6) revealed distinct clustering of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds, with separation based on batch groups.
This finding highlights the influence of regional and harvesting differences on the phytochemical composition.

Chlorogenic acid/3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid aligns with the positive PC1 axis, while Quercitrin/Luteolin aligns with the positive PC2 axis.
Group 1 (Kunlun Chrysanthemum) samples exhibit generally low component values.
Group 2 (Jiajin Chrysanthemum) samples show high PC1 values, indicating elevated levels of Chlorogenic acid/3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid.
Group 3 (Chrysanthemum buds) samples display high PC2 values, reflecting increased Quercitrin/Luteolin content.
Distinct clustering is observed for Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds, highlighting compositional variations among sample types and batches.
Despite extensive research on the phytochemical and antioxidant properties ofCoreopsis tinctoria(Snow Chrysanthemum), few studies have systematically compared its chemical composition across different regions and harvesting stages or developed efficient methods for multi‐component analysis.
Our study addresses these gaps by establishing a high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC‐UV) method to simultaneously quantify four key active ingredients—two phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and 3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid) and two flavonoids (quercitrin and luteolin)—using a single, optimized mobile phase, surpassing prior methods that targeted single components or required complex protocols.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive antioxidant evaluation using both DPPH and ABTS assays, exploring multi‐component synergy.
By comparing Kunlun Chrysanthemum (Xinjiang), Jiajin Chrysanthemum (Sichuan), and Chrysanthemum buds, this study is the first to reveal significant regional and harvesting‐time differences in chemical profiles, offering novel insights for quality control and therapeutic optimization of Snow Chrysanthemum.
Differences in altitude, temperature, humidity, light intensity, planting environment, soil nutrients, cultivation measures, and harvesting of Chrysanthemums can all alter their indicator component content.
In addition, different drying methods—natural air drying or mechanical drying may—also lead to varying degrees of degradation or transformation of some active substances, thereby affecting their efficacy and quality.
Differences in flower picking time are important in relation to differences in the composition of Chrysanthemum buds and Snow Chrysanthemum, specifically due to altered metabolism at different stages of a plant's life cycle as the flowers develop from buds.
The observed differences in phytochemical profiles among Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds have significant implications for their use in product development and therapeutic applications.
Chrysanthemum buds, despite having slightly lower phenolic acid content (chlorogenic acid: 1.21 mg/g; 3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid: 1.07 mg/g) compared to Kunlun Chrysanthemum (1.86 mg/g and 3.71 mg/g, respectively), are notably richer in flavonoids, with quercitrin (3.00 mg/g) and luteolin (0.70 mg/g) contents surpassing those of Kunlun Chrysanthemum (2.15 mg/g and 0.33 mg/g) (Table4).
Their comparable antioxidant capacity highlights their potential as a high‐value raw material for nutraceuticals or functional foods targeting oxidative stress‐related conditions.
Conversely, Jiajin Chrysanthemum exhibits superior phenolic acid and flavonoid content, with chlorogenic acid (5.24 mg/g) and quercitrin (3.92 mg/g) levels approximately 2.8 and 1.8 times higher than those of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, respectively, alongside enhanced antioxidant activity (DPPH IC50: 1.33 mg/mL vs. 1.20 mg/mL) (Table4, Figure5).
This makes Jiajin Chrysanthemum a promising candidate for developing antioxidant‐rich health products, such as herbal teas or dietary supplements, and supports the expansion of cultivation in Sichuan's Jiajin Mountain as an emerging production area.
These findings suggest that tailoring product development to the unique chemical profiles of each Chrysanthemum type—leveraging the flavonoid‐rich buds for anti‐inflammatory or skin health applications and the phenolic‐rich Jiajin variety for cardiovascular or metabolic health—could optimize their therapeutic and commercial value.
In this study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of four key ingredients in Snow Chrysanthemums together with the determination of antioxidant capacity using two techniques.
Although 21 samples were studied, these came from seven batches, from only three regions.
We did not determine other phenolic compounds such as marein, isookanin, or cymaroside, or various flavones etc., which may also contribute to the biological activities of Snow Chrysanthemums.
We examined antioxidant activity, but none of the other biological activities such as anti‐hypertensive effects and cytotoxic activity on cancer cells etc. (Dias et al.2012; Jiang, Le, Liu, et al.2016; Jiang, Le, Zhai, et al.2016; Li et al.2014; Xie et al.2009; Yang et al.2014).
Additionally, while our findings suggest that the four quantified compounds in Snow Chrysanthemum significantly contribute to its antioxidant activity, they may not exclusively, further studies are needed to explore the roles of other bioactive constituents.
Future studies using our methods could examine specific differences in cultivation, climate, harvesting, and drying of Snow Chrysanthemums to optimize chemical composition.
In addition, exploration of interactions between the different active ingredients is required to reveal the scientific basis of the antioxidant properties of Snow Chrysanthemum and to promote its development and medicinal use.
Hotan, Xinjiang is one of the main production areas of Snow Chrysanthemum.
In addition to Jiajinshan, Sichuan, it is also planted in Yunnan, Qinghai, and other regions.
In future research, more Snow Chrysanthemum samples from different production areas can be added to comprehensively understand the characteristics of samples from different production areas, and thus develop more accurate quality testing methods and enhance the generalizability of our findings.
At present, widely recognized free radical models such as DPPH and ABTS are widely used in antioxidant experiments.
The results of this experiment indicate that Snow Chrysanthemum has a high free radical scavenging effects, indicating that Snow Chrysanthemum has good in vitro antioxidant activity.
Free radicals are a highly active substances produced during the metabolic process of living organisms.
Excessive free radicals can cause oxidative damage to biological membranes, enzymes, vitamins, proteins, and live cell functions.
The next step is to study the antioxidant activity of Snow Chrysanthemum in vivo, providing a reference for its development and utilization.
We successfully established a method for simultaneously quantitatively analyzing four key active ingredients in Snow Chrysanthemums and demonstrated differences in their content in Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds.
Smaller differences in antioxidant activity in the three forms of Snow Chrysanthemum were found.
These data support further research exploring the functions and mechanisms of these active ingredients but also provide a methodological reference for the quality monitoring of Snow Chrysanthemums.
Future research should focus on exploring the interactions and mechanisms between different active ingredients and develop their potential as a natural plant resource in health care.
