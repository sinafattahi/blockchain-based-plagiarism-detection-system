Natural product tanshinone I exhibits weak potency and poor drug-like properties, which have restricted its clinical development as an anticancer agent.
Herein, twenty novel tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivatives and a pyridinium salt precursor were designed and synthesized, and their antitumor activities were evaluated.
Among these tanshinone I-pyridinium salts, compounda4, bearing a 4-bromobenzoylmethyl substituent at theN-1 position of the pyridine ring, showed the most potent cytotoxicity against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and prostate cancer (22RV1) cell lines, with IC50values of 1.40–1.63 μM.
Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest thata4targets PI3Kα with the IC50of 9.24 ± 0.20 μM and exerts effective inhibition of the phosphorylation of key PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling proteins.
Besides,a4significantly downregulates the expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1, indicating its potential to activate tumor immunity.
These findings demonstrate that tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivativea4is a novel PI3Kα inhibitor, providing a solid foundation for further development of antitumor agents.

Cancer is a complex genomic disorder characterized by significant heterogeneity and drug resistance, greatly complicating its treatment [1].
Although current therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have improved patient survival to some extent, their clinical effectiveness remains limited by poor selectivity, significant toxicity, and acquired drug resistance [2].
Thus, developing novel anticancer agents with high selectivity and low toxicity remains in great demand for current medicinal chemistry research [3,4].
Natural products, particularly those derived from traditional Chinese medicines, have long served as valuable sources for anticancer drug discovery due to their structural diversity and multi-targeted effects [5,6].Salvia miltiorrhiza, a widely-used traditional Chinese medicinal herb for cardiovascular diseases, contains bioactive constituents known as tanshinones that have exhibited potential anticancer activity [7].
Tanshinones, such as tanshinone I (Tan I), tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), dihydrotanshinone (DHT) and cryptotanshinone (CPT), exhibit multiple anticancer mechanisms, including anti-proliferative effects, apoptosis induction, immune modulation, and angiogenesis inhibition [8–14] (Fig.1A).
Among these, tanshinone I (T1), despite its relatively low abundance and limited research, has demonstrated prominent inhibitory effects against various cancers, including breast, liver, and prostate cancer [15–18].
However, the clinical application of tanshinone I has been restricted by its low aqueous solubility, poor bioavailability, and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties [19–21].
To enhance its solubility, bioavailability, anticancer activity, and selectivity, structural modification of tanshinone through molecular hybridization by incorporating pharmacophores such as pyridinium salt has been performed in the study [22–25].
Pyridine moieties are widely present in numerous FDA-approved anticancer drugs due to their favorable electronic properties and hydrogen bond acceptor capabilities, which can enhance pharmacokinetic profiles and molecular interactions [26–28].
It has been reported that over 20% of small-molecule anticancer agents contain a pyridine ring or its derivatives.
Representative examples include Sorafenib, Vismodegib, and Crizotinib (Fig.1B).
Based on this rationale, we introduced an imidazole linker into ring C of Tan I and synthesized a series of novel tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivatives, whose anticancer activities and preliminary mechanisms were systematically investigated [29,30].
This study not only expands structural diversity and biological applications of tanshinone derivatives but also provides new directions for the development of novel anticancer agents.
As shown in Scheme1, tanshinone I (a1) is structurally characterized by a naphthalene ring A/B, an ortho-quinone ring C, and a furan ring D. To enhance aqueous solubility and molecular stability, structural modification of tanshinone I was performed by introducing an imidazole moiety as a linker onto ring C and a pyridine ring to form the salt, using commercially available tanshinone I (a1) as the starting material.
Specifically, pyridine derivativea2was synthesized via the Debus-Radziszewski reaction ofa1with 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde in acetic acid and ammonium acetate under microwave irradiation (100 °C).
Single crystals of compounda2were obtained by solvent crystallization, and the structure ofa2was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (CCDC 2447458, Fig.2).
Subsequent quaternization of pyridine derivativea2with various alkyl bromides in acetonitrile afforded a series of tanshinone I-pyridinium salts (a3-a22) in yields ranging from 36 to 97%.
To summarize, the structures and yields of all new tanshinone I-pyridinium salts derivatives were shown in Table1.
Twenty synthesized tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivatives (a3-a22), together with tanshinone I (a1) and pyridine derivative (a2), were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines, including breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and prostate cancer (22RV1), by using the MTS assay.
Cisplatin (DDP) and paclitaxel were chosen as positive controls.
The results are summarized in Table2.
The aqueous solubility of selected analogues exhibiting enhanced antitumor activity (a2,a4, anda16) was evaluated by a previously reported ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometric method [31].
As anticipated, the conversion of these derivatives into their corresponding pyridinium salts significantly improved their aqueous solubility compared to the parent compounda1.
Specifically, the pyridinium saltsa4anda16demonstrated notably higher solubilities (85 ± 4 μg/mL and 86 ± 5 μg/mL, respectively) relative to their non-salt precursora2(32 ± 5 μg/mL).
These findings highlight the beneficial impact of pyridinium salt formation on enhancing the aqueous solubility of the synthesized compounds.
By comparison, the aqueous solubility of compounda1was too low to be accurately determined by this method (literature-reported solubility < 0.1 μg/mL [21]).
As presented in Table2, the majority of tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivatives showed the potential inhibitory activity.
A series of newly synthesized tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivatives displayed markedly higher in vitro cytotoxic activity than the unmodified parent compound (a1), indicating that incorporation of a pyridinium moiety is critical for enhancing the anticancer activity of tanshinone I. Specifically, the nature of the substituent at theN-1 position of the pyridine ring profoundly influenced antitumor potency.
Pyridinium salts bearing an acyl-linked substituent atN-1 (e.g., a benzoylmethyl group) were significantly more potent than those with benzyl or alkyl linkers.
Notably, the pyridinium salt derivative with a 4-bromobenzoylmethyl substituent (a4) exhibited the best potent cytotoxic activity (IC50= 1.40–1.63 µM).
Moreover, the electron-withdrawing 4-bromobenzoylmethyl group (a4) conferred greater potency than the electron-donating 4-methoxybenzoylmethyl substituent (a5), demonstrating that electron-withdrawing substituent was more favorable for cytotoxic activity.
In addition, compounds with a single aromatic-ring substituent generally showed higher activity than those with disubstituted rings, and the substituent’s position had a pronounced effect.
For example, the 2-bromobenzyl derivative (a9) exhibited higher potency than the 2-bromo-4-nitrobenzyl derivative (a19).
Furthermore, the meta-substituted analog (a7) was significantly more active than the ortho-substituted counterpart (a15), this highlights the importance of substituent position.
Additionally, naphthalene analogs featuring an acylmethyl linker were more active than those lacking this moiety, further highlighting the key influence of linker structure on cytotoxic potency.
Conversely, an aliphatic substituent (isobutenyl ina22) yielded much lower activity than aromatic substituents, indicating that such chain substituents provide limited benefit for antitumor potency.
In summary,SARanalysis demonstrates that introducing a pyridinium fragment is pivotal for boosting the activity of tanshinone I derivatives.
The linkage mode of the N-1 substituent, the electronic nature and position of aromatic substituents significantly impact in vitro cytotoxic activity.
These results offer an important theoretical basis for further structural optimization.
The preliminary structure activity relationships (SARs) of the pyridinium salt derivatives were summarized in Scheme2.
To elucidate the potential mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effect of compounda4, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Compounda4induced apoptosis by was assessed using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay.
As shown in Fig.3, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with compounda4at 1, 2, and 4 μM for 48 h significantly increased apoptosis rates to 2.69%, 11.48%, and 75.81%, respectively.
These results indicate that compounda4induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Further, the effect of compounda4on the cell cycle distribution of MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 μM.
Cell cycle analysis by PI staining and flow cytometry revealed that compounda4caused no significant cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.4).
Collectively, apoptosis induction rather than cell cycle arrest primarily contributed to its anticancer activity of compounda4.
Scratch wound healing assay was conducted to test whethera4impaired the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.
The migration rates at 24 h of MDA-MB-231 cells decreased with the increasinga4in Fig.5.
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling ranks one of the most frequently dysregulated signaling pathways in cancer by promoting tumor initiation and progression [32,33].
Further, abnormal PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation resulted PD-L1 increase facilitates the escape of cancer cells from the immunosurveillance of immune system [34].
Thus, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling components such as PI3K and mTOR are potential therapeutic targets in cancer, and the identification of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors have drawn extensive attention.
In particular, the PI3K has four subtypes (α/β/γ/δ), while overexpression and mutation resulted abnormal activation of PI3Kα is closely to the progression of solid cancers, therefore, PI3Kα has become a key target for the development of anticancer drugs.
To date, alpelisib is the only PI3Kα inhibitor approved for the treatment of breast cancer, and several other PI3Kα inhibitors are under evaluation in clinical trials [35], which give us proposal for the development of novel PI3Kα inhibitors for tumor therapy.
To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of compounda4, molecular docking analysis was performed to identify potential target-proteins and subsequent biological experiments were conducted to confirm the precise target predicted.
Molecular docking analysis of compounda4with putative targets revealed strong binding affinities toward PI3Kα (Fig.6A).
The compound binds within the PI3Kα active site, forming a hydrogen bond (2.2 Å) between its benzoyl oxygen and the LYS802 residue.
The conjugated polycyclic framework of compounda4contributes significantly to binding through multiple π-π stacking interactions: two with the benzene ring of TPR780 (4.8 Å and 5.2 Å) and one with TYR836 involving the compound’s furan ring (5.0 Å).
Additionally, hydrophobic π-sulfur interactions are observed between the conjugated system of compounda4and the sulfur atom of MET922 (4.1 Å and 3.9 Å).
To further confirm the interaction ofa4and PI3Kα, the PI3Kα inhibitory ofa4was performed.
As shown in Fig.6B,a4inhibited PI3Kα in a dose dependent manner, with an IC50of 9.24 ± 0.20 μM, indicatinga4was a novel PI3Kα inhibitor.
Subsequent western blot analysis demonstrated that compounda4exerts dual regulatory effects on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and tumor immune microenvironment by analyzing key signaling proteins and immune checkpoint molecules (Fig.6C, D).
Using the PI3K inhibitor GDC0032 as a positive control, Western blot results demonstrated thata4, while showing no impact on total protein levels of AKT, S6K, or S6, exerted concentration-dependent inhibition on phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-S6K (Thr389), and phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), indicatinga4effectively blocks PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.
Notably,a4exhibited enhanced PD-L1 downregulation.
These findings establish a “pathway inhibition-immunoactivation” synergy, offering a novel therapeutic strategy against tumor immune evasion.
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized a series of novel tanshinone I-pyridinium salt derivatives.
This method enabled the rapid construction of structurally diverse tanshinone I-pyridinium hybrid molecules, and in vitro activity evaluation demonstrated that these derivatives exhibit potential antitumor activity.
Notably,SARsrevealed that the pyridinium moiety was identified as the critical structural feature responsible for the enhanced in vitro cytotoxic activity of the tanshinone I derivatives.
Compounda4, featuring a 4-bromobenzoylmethyl substituent at theN-1 position of the pyridine ring, was the most active derivative in the series, with IC50values of 1.41, 1.63 and 1.40 μM against human cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, HepG2 and 22RV1, respectively, indicating thata4exhibited the most potent antitumor activity among all derivatives.
Meanwhile, compounda4demonstrated markedly improved aqueous solubility (85 μg/mL).
Furthermore, cell cycle, apoptosis and migration studies indicated thata4induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and migration inhibition in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in a markedly dose-dependent manner.
Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that compounda4is a novel PI3Kα inhibitor and exerts its antitumor effects through a dual mechanism.
On one hand, it effectively inhibits the phosphorylation of downstream key proteins in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; on the other hand, it significantly downregulates the expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1.
These findings not only provide an efficient structural optimization strategy for the development of tanshinone I-based anticancer agents, but also suggest that compounda4is a promising candidate for further antitumor studies.

The human cancer cell lines, including breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and prostate cancer (22RV1) were obtained from Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA).
All the cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2in a humidified atmosphere.
Cytotoxic activities were evaluated by the MTS assay.
All the compounds tested were absolutely dissolved to 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in stock.
Cells (5 × 103cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates and cultured for 12 h before treatment and continuously exposed to 0.032, 0.16, 0.8, 4 and 20 µM test compounds for 48 h. Then MTS reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to each well, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1–4 h and the optical density (OD) was measured at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
The IC50values were calculated from dose–response curves.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fixed overnight at 4 °C in 70% ethanol.
After fixation, cells were washed again and incubated with propidium iodide (PI, 50 µg/mL) in the presence of RNase A (50 µg/mL) at room temperature for 30 min.
Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (version 10.9.0).
Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 3 × 105cells/well, and treated with indicated concentrations of test compounds for 48 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer containing Annexin V-FITC and PI.
Following incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 min, fluorescence intensity was quantified using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Cell migration rates following 24 h incubation witha4was quantitatively assessed using ImageJ software by measuring the wound closure area between the opposing edges.
The inhibitory activity ofa4on PI3Kα was evaluated as previously based on the production of PIP3 with the PI3-Kinase Activity ELISA kit (K-1000 s, Echelon) [25].
The cells (Breast cancer, MDA-MB-231) were treated with compounds for indicated time and subjected to western blot analysis as previously [25].
The antibodies against AKT (#4691), phosphor-AKT (Ser473) (#9271), S6K (#2708), phosphor-S6K (Thr389) (#9234), S6 (#9202), phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) (#88441) and PD-L1 (#13684) were all from the Cell signaling technology, and the antibody for GAPDH (MAB374) was provided by Sigma.
All data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD).
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5 software.
Pairwise comparisons among groups were analyzed using Tukey's test.
Differences were considered statistically significant atp< 0.05.
