Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly contagious pathogen that affects several animal families.
While animals of all ages are susceptible, puppies face the highest risk.
This study aimed to detect CDV in dogs with suspected infection, isolate the virus and develop a sensitive antigen‐ELISA test using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
Samples were collected from 40 dogs and tested by RT‐PCR, then cultured positive samples in MDCK cells for virus isolation.
In addition, the CDV F protein gene sequence obtained from the MDCK‐34388 isolate was added to GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate belongs to the Asia‐1 genotype.
Among the 40 tested dogs, 29 (72.5%) tested positive for CDV, exhibiting respiratory, neurological and mixed symptoms in 62.5%, 15% and 22.5% of cases, respectively.
Using an inactivated CDV isolate, we produced monoclonal antibodies in BALB/c mice and polyclonal antibodies in New Zealand rabbits.
For ELISA development, we HRP‐labelled the 1G10‐1A monoclonal antibody that targets the CDV F protein.
The antigen ELISA test we developed showed 90% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, with positive and negative predictive values of 87.8% and 89.74%, respectively.
These findings indicate that the antigen ELISA test is a reliable diagnostic tool for CDV detection, complementing RT‐PCR and supporting effective disease management for veterinary practice.
The present work describes the isolation and characterization of CDV from dogs and its molecular confirmation by RT‐PCR targeting the gene encoding the F protein.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were undertaken to determine the strain relatedness of the viral genome.
To raise antibodies, we immunized BALB/c mice with an inactivated isolate of CDV for generating mAbs and developed pAbs in rabbits.
Finally, we produced mAbs and developed a sandwich ELISA test for antigen detection.
The test uses a polyclonal antibody for antigen capture, while HRP‐conjugated monoclonal antibodies are used for detection.
Canine distemper (CD) is a disease that affects approximately 20 subspecies, particularly dogs.
Although its existence was known as early as the 1700s, the first report of the disease dates back to Spain in 1746 (Blancou2004).
This disease is considered the second most deadly infectious disease in dogs after rabies (Deem et al.2000).
The causative agent of CD isMorbillivirus canis, which was called canine distemper virus (CDV) for many years, was renamedCanis morbillivirusin 2016 andM.
canisin 2022 (https://ictv.global/taxonomy).
CDV is in theParamyxoviridaefamily, in theOrthoparamyxovirinaesubfamily, and theMorbillivirusgenus in the subfamily.
TheMorbillivirusgenus includes viruses of significant importance to both humans and animals, which are Measles virus (Morbillivirus hominis), Rinderpest virus (Morbillivirus pecoris), Peste des petits ruminats virus (Morbillivirus caprinae), Feline morbillivirus (Morbillivirus felis), Phocine morbillivirus (Morbillivirus phocae) and Cetacean morbillivirus (Morbillivirus ceti) are other members of this genus (ICTV2024).
Morbilliviruses share genetic similarities, with comparable morphology, gene structures and protein compositions.
The virion diameter ranges between 150 and 300 nm, typically exhibiting a helical morphology (Pardo et al.2005; Rendon‐Marin et al.2019).
The CDV genome consists of 15,690 nucleotides.
Its nucleic acid is single‐stranded (ss) RNA, negative‐sense and non‐segmented.
The virus encodes eight proteins, including six structural proteins‐hemagglutinin (H), fusion (F), nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), polymerase (L) and phosphoprotein (P), and two non‐structural proteins (C and V) which are encoded by the P gene (MacLachlan et al.2016; Lozada et al.2021; Valle et al.2020).
CDV utilizes two cell receptors for its replication mechanism—the Signalling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM, CD150) receptor and the Nectin‐4 receptor (CD46, poliovirus receptor‐like protein 4 (PVRL4) (von Messling et al.2005; Pratakpiriya et al.2012).
In addition, a recent study showed that lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 6 (LRP6) is a functional receptor for attenuated CDV strains, even in the absence of SLAM or Nectin‐4 (Gradauskaite et al.2023).
CDV infects a wide range of animal families, including theCanidae,Ursidae,Ailuridae,MustelidaeandFelidae(MacLachlan et al.2016).
Since the crossover between species is high, many studies have been conducted (Beineke et al.2015; Duque‐Valencia et al. 2019).
Based on the H gene sequence, at least 21 strains have been identified: America‐1, America‐2, North America‐3, South America/North America‐4, America‐5, Canada 1 and 2, Asia‐1, Asia‐2, Asia‐3, Asia‐4, Asia‐5, Asia‐6, European Wildlife, Arctic, Africa‐1, Africa‐2, Europe‐1/South America‐1, South America‐2, South America‐3 and Rockborn‐like (Echeverry‐Bonilla et al.2022; Giacinti et al.2022).
In recent years, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as a significant both diagnostic and therapeutic tool.
Since their discovery by Köhler and Milstein (1975), mAbs have been frequently used in disease research and clinical applications.
Hybridoma technology, which involves the fusion of antibody‐producing B cells with immortal myeloma cells, enables the production of specific mAbs (Pandey2010; Selimoğlu et al.2016).
The enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a widely used diagnostic method, known for its high sensitivity and specificity.
While several commercial ELISA kits can detect CDV, they have significant drawbacks—high costs, dependence on cold‐chain requirements, limited availability and lower sensitivity in field conditions.
These limitations make them impractical, especially in low‐resource veterinary settings.
RT‐PCR, though considered the gold standard for CDV diagnosis, requires sophisticated equipment and technical expertise, making it unsuitable outside specialized laboratories.
To address these limitations, we developed a cost‐effective, field‐adaptable antigen ELISA using in‐house‐produced antibodies.
The assay utilizes polyclonal antibodies for broad‐spectrum antigen capture and a monoclonal antibody targeting the CDV F protein for detection.
This combination improves diagnostic accuracy while offering a rapid, practical diagnostic alternative for routine veterinary practice, especially in field settings where conventional methods are not feasible.
The Erciyes University (ERU) Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee approved all animal experimental studies (decision no. 22/117).
In this study, samples were collected from dogs with suspected CDV infection at the ERU Veterinary Faculty Animal Hospital in Kayseri, Türkiye.
The dogs exhibited symptoms including bilateral tears, respiratory problems, fever and central nervous system abnormalities.
The samples were used for virus isolation, identification and production of mAbs and pAbs.
The conjunctival swabs were diluted with sterile 1× PBS containing 10% penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin B (BI Technology) and filtered with a 0.45 µm syringe filter (GVS).
Blood samples from dogs suspected of CDV were collected in EDTA blood tubes (BD Vacutainer), and lymphocytes were obtained using Ficoll (Sigma).
Female BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks were used to produce mAbs, while female New Zealand rabbits aged 6–8 months were used to produce pAbs.
In the study, MDCK (Madin‐Darby Canine Kidney, ATCC, NBL‐2) cell lines were used throughout the study for virus isolation from leukocyte and conjunctival swab samples taken from CDV‐suspected dogs and turned into inoculum.
The F0 myeloma (ATCC, CRL‐1646) cell line was used to produce mAbs.
In addition, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Low glucose) (Capricorn) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI‐1640) (Gibco) were used as cell culture media.
Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (BI Technology) and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin B (antibiotic‐antimycotic) were added to the media.
Inoculation of virus samples collected from the field was seeded into the MDCK cell line.
MDCK cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2for virus isolation and observation of cytopathic effects (CPEs).
The cells became monolayers, and seeding was done using the adsorption method.
After the 10th day, the cells were taken to −80°C, and freeze‐thaw cycles were performed.
At the end of the thawing, the medium in the flasks was taken and centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 30 min at +4°C.
The virus check was performed with reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR).
Canine samples collected from the field and isolated in cell culture were identified with RT‐PCR.
For this purpose, RNA extraction was first performed using the guanidine–thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform method (Chomczynski and Sacchi2006).
Then, the obtained RNA was synthesized to complementary DNA (cDNA) according to the kit procedure (ThermoFisher, k1622).
Subsequently, cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed using primers specifically designed to target the CDV F gene, with the forward primer (5′‐TGGGATTATCGGGACTGA‐3′) and reverse primer (5′‐GGGCCAAATATTGACAAC‐3′) as described by Romanutti et al. (2016). The PCR reaction mixture was prepared using the TransGen EasyTaq PCR Kit by adding 5 µL of cDNA, 1 µL of each primer, 1 µL of 10 mM dNTP, 5 µL of 10× EasyTaq Buffer, 0.5 µL of Taq DNA polymerase and 36.5 µL of nuclease‐free water (NFW).
PCR amplification began with an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 54°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min.
The process concluded with a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.
RT‐PCR analysis included both positive and negative controls to ensure result reliability.
RT‐PCR‐positive samples were separated and grown in cell culture dishes.
The resulting isolates underwent freeze‐thaw cycles and were confirmed by RT‐PCR.
The PCR amplicon obtained was sent to the Life Sciences sequencing service (Ankara, Türkiye).
The sequence was assembled and trimmed with Bioedit (version 7.7.1) (Hall et al. 2011) and analysed with MEGA 11 by using Clustal W and Neighbour‐joining (version 11.0.13) (Tamura et al.2021).
After constructing the phylogenetic tree, it was visualized and coloured using the iToL online database (Interactive Tree of Life,https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi).
The isolated CDV sample was concentrated with PEG8000 (Berber et al.2021).
The obtained samples were then confirmed again by the RT‐PCR method, and the concentrated protein amount was measured using the Biorad kit based on the Bradford protein test method (Bradford1976).
The PEG8000‐concentrated isolated sample was removed after waiting for 10 min under UV (Heaney et al.2002).
To check the inactivation, it was re‐inoculated into MDCK cells, and both CPE and RT‐PCR methods were checked.
CPE was monitored until the 12th day.
For PCR analysis, samples were collected on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 12th days.
RNA extraction was performed following freeze‐thaw cycles, and RT‐PCR was subsequently conducted.
Three female BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks were immunized with the inactivated CDV isolate.
The immunization was performed by diluting each immunization to 50 µg whole virion (Liu et al.2017).
The first immunization was performed with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) (ThermoFisher) at a ratio of 1:1.
The next two immunizations were performed with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (IFA) (ThermoFisher) at a ratio of 1:1, two weeks after the previous immunization.
Three days before the fusion, a boost dose was given with a 1:1 ratio of PBS and virus mixture (Singh and O'Hagan2003; Stills2005).
Macrophages were used as feeder cells to support the growth and viability of hybridoma cells following fusion.
The myeloma cells in a flask were added with 1 mL of Azaguanine (Sigma) to 50 mL of myeloma cells and continued until fusion by adding to the medium (Greenfield2021).
Passaging was performed approximately 24 h before the cells entered fusion (Hurrell1982).
For the use of macrophages, 8‐week‐old non‐immunized female BALB/c mice were used.
The mice were first anaesthetized with 40–50 mg/kg intraperitoneal Sodium Pentobarbital (Dutton et al.2019).
The obtained macrophage cells were divided into 96‐well cell culture plates at a rate of 6000 cells/well, and 100 µL/well of medium was distributed.
After dispensing 100 µL/well, the cells were incubated in a 37°C 5% CO2incubator for one day.
Following the protocol outlined by Yücel (2010), two media were prepared: M1 (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% penicillin‐streptomycin) and M2 (M1 supplemented with 20% FBS).
Mouse spleens were aseptically removed, placed in M1, and processed to isolate splenocytes.
After centrifugation, red blood cells were lysed using a hemolytic reagent, and the resulting cell pellet was re‐suspended in M1.
F0 myeloma cells were washed with serum‐free RPMI 1640 and combined with splenocytes at a 5:1 ratio.
Cell fusion was facilitated using PEG 4000 (50% w/v) at 37°C, followed by the sequential addition of M1 and M2.
After a 1‐h incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2atmosphere, the cells were centrifuged and re‐suspended in M2.
The HAT medium used for 96‐well plates was composed of 2% HAT, 20% FBS, 2% L‐glutamine, 2% D‐glucose, 2% antibiotics, 50 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U insulin and RPMI 1640.
The cells prepared after fusion were added to the HAT medium and mixed.
Then, 150 µL/well was distributed into the wells of the plates containing macrophage cells prepared the day before.
After the 10th day, it was checked with ELISA, and positive clones continued with HT medium (HT 2%, FBS 20%, L‐Glutamine 2%, D‐Glucose 2%, Antibiotic 2%, sodium pyruvate 50 mM, Insulin 100U, RPMI 1640).
The selected clone supernatants were collected every two days and concentrated using ammonium sulphate according to the manufacturer's protocol (ThermoFisher) (Harlow and Lane1988).
Subsequently, it was purified using the MabTrap Kit (Cytiva).
The amount of antibody was then determined using the Biorad DC Protein Assay protein protocol.
To determine the mAb, western blotting was performed using a 10% resolving gel and a 5% stacking gel.
Samples were prepared using 4x Laemmli buffer (Biorad).
The samples were then transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane using wet electrophoresis.
Our CDV mAb was used as the primary antibody, while goat anti‐mouse IgG HRP (Southern Biotech) served as the secondary antibody at a 1/3000 dilution.
ECL substrate (ThermoFisher) was added to visualize the mAb.
After 1 min of dark‐field incubation, imaging was performed using a chemiluminescence device (Invitrogen iBright CL750 Imaging System).
After the purification and checking, they were labelled with HRP enzyme according to the kit procedure of ThermoScientific EZ‐Link.
All conjugates on the dialysis membrane were removed.
At this stage, a 6–8‐month‐old female New Zealand rabbit was inoculated with 100 µg of whole virus antigen from the inactivated CDV isolate obtained in the study.
The rabbit serum was taken before each immunization.
The first immunization was with FCA, and the other two immunizations were with IFA.
Sera obtained from immunized rabbits were concentrated with ammonium sulphate (ThermoFisher).
Antibodies to be used in the current study were purified with the protein G column using the MabTrap Kit (Cytiva).
We compared 40 RT‐PCR‐positive and 40 RT‐PCR‐negative samples with the developed antigen ELISA test.
Each sample was tested in duplicate on the ELISA plate.
Statistical analyses were carried out by comparing the RT‐PCR results of canine samples with the data obtained from the developed antigen ELISA test.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated using GraphPad Prism 10.
Fisher's exact test was performed to assess statistical significance, with ap‐value threshold ofp< 0.05 considered statistically significant.
The clinical findings showed the following symptom distribution: Respiratory signs (n= 25, 62.5%), neurological signs (n= 6, 15%) and mixed signs (both respiratory and neurological) (n= 9, 22.5%).
Among the 40 examined dogs, (n= 15, 37.5%) were 0–6 months old, (n= 11, 27.5%) were 12–24 months old and (n= 6, 15%) were over 24 months old.
In addition, seven dogs (17.5%) exhibited high fever, with a body temperature exceeding 38.5°C (Figure1).
General characteristics of the dogs from which samples were collected.
After the samples were collected, RT‐PCR was performed using F gene primers (Figure2).
Representative samples tested by RT‐PCR.
Lane 11: Positive control, Lane 12: Negative control.
A 556 bp band was considered indicative of a positive result.
Among the positive cases, respiratory signs were the most prevalent clinical manifestation (n= 20, 68.96%), followed by mixed clinical signs (n= 6, 20.68%) and nervous signs (n= 3, 10.34%).
Notably, 6 of the 7 cases presenting with high fever (>38.5°C) were positive, while the remaining 23 positive cases exhibited normal body temperatures.
Age distribution analysis of positive cases demonstrated a progressive decline in prevalence with increasing age: 48.27% (n= 14) were aged 0–6 months, 24.13% (n= 7) were 6–12 months, 17.24% (n= 5) were 12–24 months and 10.34% (n= 3) were older than 24 months.
After the samples were turned into inoculum in the laboratory, they were inoculated into 24‐well plates.
CPE was observed in samples 37319 and 34388 in Figure3.
All samples were then confirmed by RT‐PCR.
The isolated MDCK34388 was inactivated under UV and was inoculated into MDCK cells again to be checked.

(a) Sample number 37319, (b) Sample number 34388, (c) control MDCK cell.
The CDV F protein gene sequence was obtained, and this sequence was added to NCBI/GenBank (accession numberPQ537086.1).
According to the phylogenetic tree, we were isolated in the Asia 1 geographical strains (Figure4).
Phylogenetic analysis was created using the iToL database, showing the classification of the isolate among global CDV strains.
Mice were immunized with inactivated CDV strain MDCK34388, and serum antibody titers were evaluated by means of indirect ELISA following the third immunization.
Mouse 2 exhibited a high antibody titer of 1/64,000, exceeding the predefined threshold for progression (>1/50,000).
Consequently, hybridoma fusion was performed using splenocytes from this mouse.
The ratio of F0 splenocytes to myeloma cells was maintained at 5:1, using 108 × 106F0 splenocytes and 21 × 106myeloma cells.
Following the fusion procedure, clones began forming from the 4th day, and those formed on the 10th day were scanned for antibodies by ELISA (Figure5).
Clones are formed after the fusion procedure.
(a) Clones observed on the 4th day and (b) clones observed on the 10th day.
After the 4th day, unfused myeloma cells and B cells did not survive, while only successfully fused hybridoma cells continued to proliferate.
Out of 1056 wells, 129 contained clones that were tested for antibodies using the ELISA method.
From these, 62 positive clones were transferred to a 24‐well cell culture plate and screened again for antibodies after 3 days.
Ultimately, four clones (1G10, 2F6, 3B4, 3D8) were selected for sub‐dilution and expansion, followed by another round of ELISA screening.
Based on the cut‐off value, all sub‐clones of the 1G10 clone were seen as positive.
In addition, only 2B and 2C sub‐clones from the 3B4 clone exhibited positivity.
All other clones and their respective sub‐clones tested negative.
Despite this, the 3B4‐2B and 3B4‐2C sub‐clones stopped antibody production in the next passages.
In subsequent propagations, only 1G10 demonstrated positive results.
For this reason, all 1G10 sub‐clones were propagated in flasks, and their antibody positivity was confirmed again by ELISA.
Clones 1A, 2A and 1FGH (a combination of 1F, 1G and 1H) derived from the 1G10 hybridoma were propagated separately in culture flasks.
Supernatants were collected every three days following centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
To ensure long‐term preservation, 50% of the clones were cryopreserved in sub‐passages post‐centrifugation.
Antibodies purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation and Protein G affinity chromatography demonstrated specific reactivity against the MDCK34388 CDV antigen in Western blot analysis (Figure6), confirming their potential for diagnostic applications.

The detected band corresponds to an approximate molecular weight of 73 kDa, confirming the presence of the target protein.
According to the ELISA results, the pAbs titer, which initially started from 1/8000, exceeded 1/128000 after the third immunization.
The obtained sera were concentrated with ammonium sulphate and then purified with the Protein G column.
Subsequently, the 1G10‐1AHRP conjugate was prepared, and the Sandwich ELISA method was applied to develop the Antigen ELISA test.
Figure7illustrates the optical density (OD) values obtained at different antibody and conjugate dilutions, which were evaluated to optimize assay conditions.
Evaluation of OD values at varying antibody dilutions.
Optimal signal‐to‐noise ratios were achieved with polyclonal antibodies diluted at 1/1000–1/3000 and conjugates at 1/100–1/200.
The 1/400 conjugate yielded consistently low signals, indicating suboptimal assay performance.
The study used 40 positive samples, 29 field samples confirmed positive by RT‐PCR and 11 cell culture isolates.
In addition, 40 laboratory samples previously determined negative by RT‐PCR were used as negative controls.
All 80 canine samples underwent antigen‐ELISA screening, with cut‐off values calculated separately for the ELISA plate.
The medium was used as a negative control to assess background interference.
Sample results were evaluated based on the blocking solution cut‐off value.
A total of 80 samples were evaluated, including 29 field samples confirmed positive by RT‐PCR, 11 CDV‐positive cell culture samples and 40 RT‐PCR‐confirmed negative clinical samples.
The in‐house antigen ELISA correctly identified 25 field positives and all 11 cell culture isolates as positive, along with 36 of 40 negative samples (Table1).
However, a few discrepancies between RT‐PCR and ELISA results were observed, including false positives and false negatives (Table2).
These outcomes were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and ROC values of the developed test.

Comparison of RT‐PCR and Developed Antigen ELISA results.
As a result of the RT‐PCR of the canine samples obtained from dogs, 29 samples were found positive and 11 samples negative, while in the developed Antigen ELISA (Sandwich ELISA) test, 28 samples were found positive, and 12 samples were negative.
However, four positive samples in RT‐PCR were found to be false negatives and five false positives.
These data were used in the GraphPad Prism 10 program to obtain the statistical results in Table2.
The sensitivity of the developed antigen ELISA test was 90%, and the specificity was 87.50%.
In addition, as a result of the statistical analysis, the positive predictive value was defined as 87.80%, and the negative predictive value was determined as 89.74%.
According to Fisher's Exact test method, thepvalue was statistically significant (p< 0.05).
Table3presents the statistical comparison between RT‐PCR and the developed Antigen ELISA test, including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratio.
Statistical analysis results comparing RT‐PCR and the developed Antigen ELISA test, as calculated using GraphPad Prism 10.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined based on test performance.
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the developed antigen ELISA, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed by comparing the ELISA results with RT‐PCR, which served as the reference method.
The analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.89, indicating a high level of diagnostic accuracy (Figure8).
This result expresses the ELISA test's ability to correctly distinguish between RT‐PCR‐positive and negative samples, supporting its potential utility as a reliable screening tool in clinical and field settings.

The test yielded an AUC of 0.89, indicating high diagnostic performance.
CD is a globally prevalent viral disease that poses a significant threat to both domestic dogs and wild animals, leading to substantial economic losses.
Like many viral diseases, it does not have a specific treatment; rapid and early diagnosis and strengthening the immune system against secondary infections can increase the success of treatment.
In particular, reaching the central system of CDV and starting therapy with early diagnosis before neurological symptoms appear may be necessary in preventing old dog encephalitis as well as improving the chances of treating dogs.
(Blancou2004; Martella et al.2008; A. Beineke et al.2009).
Studies examining CDV detection via RT‐PCR have reported varying positivity rates—in Türkiye, 62% in stray dogs (Saltik and Kale2021) and 50.76% (Hasırcıoğlu and Aslım2021), while international studies found 7.50% in Nigeria (Temilade et al.2015) and 27.30% in Brazil (Dezengrini et al.2017).
In the present study, a 72.5% positivity rate (n= 40) was revealed.
In this study, CPEs, including cell rounding and vacuolation, were observed in MDCK cells starting from Day 7 post‐inoculation.
However, syncytium formation, a characteristic feature of CDV, was not detected.
This absence was likely due to MDCK cells lacking the SLAM receptor, which enhances CDV replication and promotes syncytium formation in cell lines like Vero‐SLAM or MDCK‐SLAM (Seki et al.2003; Lan et al.2005; Woma and Van Vuuren2009).
While MDCK cells can support initial CDV isolation, studies have shown that SLAM‐expressing recombinant cell lines offer better viral yield and clearer CPE visibility.
For future virus isolation work, these engineered cell lines or primary canine cells may, therefore, be more advantageous.
After Köhler and Milstein's discovery of mAbs (1975), mAbs were produced against many antigens.
Thanks to hybridoma technology, the use of mAb has increased in both diagnostic and therapeutic studies (Buss et al.2012).
In this study, mAbs were successfully generated in BALB/c mice by using inactivated CDV, with optimized immunization and fusion protocols.
The use of PEG 1500 for fusion yielded more consistent results compared to PEG 4000, aligning with previous reports (Chowdhury et al.,2024; Yücel and Çirakoğlu,1999).
Although electrofusion methods offer higher clone efficiency (Song et al.2022), PEG‐mediated chemical fusion remains a practical and reliable approach for routine mAb production.
The accomplishment of monoclonal antibody production in this study was supported by optimized fusion conditions, including appropriate timing of myeloma cell passaging (Hurrel1982) and cell ratio selection (Yücel2010).
Myeloma cells were cultured under standard pre‐fusion conditions, and a 5:1 splenocyte‐to‐myeloma cell ratio within the optimal range reported in the literature was used to ensure efficient fusion.
These methodological choices contributed to the effective generation of high‐titer hybridomas.
Daily scanning of over 1000 wells across eleven 96‐well plates yielded 129 clones.
Initial antibody‐ELISA screening identified 62 positive clones (48.06%); however, rescreening reduced this to four (3.1%): 2F6, 1G10, 3D8 and 1B4.
Following serial dilution and further testing, only 1G10's sub‐clones maintained antibody production and were preserved at −80°C.
Chromosome instability in hybridomas (combined mouse spleen and myeloma cells) primarily explains the loss of antibody production (Parray et al.2020).
Wu et al. (2022) suggest electrofusion creates more stable hybridomas than chemical (PEG) methods.
Therefore, clone antibody positivity was monitored at each passage.
Several studies have developed mAbs against CDV proteins such as H, F, P and N; however, many of these were not used in ELISA development or lacked diagnostic validation (Örvell et al.1985; Bi et al.2015; Liu et al.2017).
In this study, we generated a mAb targeting the native F protein—confirmed by Western blot (∼73 kDa)—and used it with in‐house polyclonal antibodies in a sandwich ELISA format.
Unlike earlier methods that rely on a single antibody or commercial mAbs targeting the H protein, our approach combines broad antigen capture with specific detection, enhancing sensitivity and specificity.
The test was validated against RT‐PCR and demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.89, offering a cost‐effective and practical alternative to existing ELISA‐based assays.
The sandwich ELISA format was selected for antigen detection owing to its higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other ELISA types.
In this approach, polyclonal antibodies were used for antigen capture, offering broad epitope recognition, while the mAb, labelled with HRP, was used for detection, ensuring high specificity.
This combination enhances test performance, especially when antigen concentration is low or epitope accessibility is limited (Leenaars et al.1999; Cui et al.2015).
Moreover, pAb and HRP‐labelled mAb were optimized for the development of the antigen ELISA assay.
As a result of the optimization, pAb at 1/1000, 1/2000 and 1/3000 gave conjugate results at rates of 1/200 and 1/400.
Zhang et al. (2020) similarly found three different mAbs at rates of 1/100, /200 and 1/400 in the sandwich ELISA test they developed.
Although the researchers used mAb to capture and detect antibodies in their study, the conjugate ratios yielded results similar to those of the antigen ELISA performed in this study.
Our study is the first study for CDV because the whole virion was used, and against it, pAb and mAb were produced.
This study successfully developed an in‐house sandwich ELISA test for CDV detection using custom‐made monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
The test's targeting of the F protein and optimized antibody pairing achieved high sensitivity and specificity, with an AUC value of 0.89.
The approach offers advantages over existing methods by combining native antigen recognition with local antibody production, creating a scalable and cost‐effective diagnostic tool.
These results advance CDV diagnostics and provide groundwork for future assay development and therapeutic antibody research.
