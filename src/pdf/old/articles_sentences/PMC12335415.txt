The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of vaccination, particularly for individuals with chronic conditions.
However, vaccine acceptancy is influenced by psychological distress and coping mechanisms.
This study aimed to examine the influence of mental health issues (anxiety, depression, and stress) and coping strategies on vaccine acceptancy.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 457 individuals with diabetes and hypertension attending two healthcare facilities in Ghana.
Participants completed validated measures, including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Africultural Coping System Inventory (ACSI), and the COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Scale.
Descriptive statistics, correlational analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used to assess predictors of vaccine acceptancy using Jamovi statistical software version 2.6.63.
The study found that stress, anxiety, and depression were strongly correlated, with higher levels of psychological distress linked to lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy.
The multivariate results after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, anxiety (β = − 0.439, p <.001) and depression (β = − 0.455, p <.001) were strong negative predictors of vaccine acceptancy.
Cognitive-emotional debriefing (β = 0.129, p =.012) was the only coping strategy significantly associated with higher vaccine acceptancy, while spiritual, collective, and ritual coping strategies had no significant impact after controlling for confounders.
Education level (β = − 0.136, p <.001) remained significant predictors indicating that highly educated individuals showed lower vaccine acceptance.
The study suggests that mental health issues significantly influence vaccine acceptance, with cognitive-emotional debriefing playing a crucial role in moderating hesitancy.
These findings highlight the need for integrating mental health support into vaccination strategies to enhance vaccine confidence among individuals with chronic conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vital role of vaccination in preventing severe illness and reducing transmission.
However, vaccine acceptance varies across populations, with mental health challenges and chronic health conditions significantly shaping attitudes towards vaccination [1,2].
Individuals with chronic illnesses often experience heightened psychological distress, which may influence their willingness to be vaccinated [3].
Mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, have been associated with lower vaccine acceptance due to concerns about side effects, distrust in healthcare systems, and misinformation [4].
A strong interrelationship has been observed among depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly in individuals managing chronic conditions, as the ongoing burden of illness, treatment regimens, and lifestyle adjustments contribute to heightened psychological distress [5–8].
Individuals with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable during pandemics, facing increased risks of infection, hospitalisation, and mortality [9].
Studies from high-income countries suggest that psychological traits such as neuroticism and depressive symptoms contribute to vaccine hesitancy by fostering distrust in medical institutions [8,9].
In South Korea, for instance, individuals with chronic conditions and co-existing mental health disorders exhibited varying levels of vaccine acceptance based on psychological traits such as gratitude and neuroticism [10].
Conversely, targeted vaccination strategies tailored to individuals with mental health conditions have demonstrated success.
In Belgium, a focused approach resulted in a 91.7% vaccination rate among psychiatric patients, significantly higher than in the general population [11].
In low- and middle-income countries, vaccine hesitancy is influenced by systemic healthcare challenges, socio-economic constraints, and cultural beliefs [12,13].
Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, faces a high burden of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes [13], yet access to healthcare, including mental health services, remains inadequate [14].
Mental health disorders are often underreported due to stigma, further complicating efforts to integrate psychological support into vaccination campaigns [15].
Misinformation and distrust in government health initiatives exacerbate vaccine reluctance, particularly among individuals with chronic conditions who already struggle with healthcare accessibility and affordability [16].
While vaccine access is less of a concern in high-income countries, distrust in healthcare systems remains a major driver of vaccine hesitancy among individuals with chronic illnesses [13,14].
Gender disparities also influence vaccine acceptance.
For instance, females are noted to express greater willingness and intention to take vaccines than their male counterparts [14,17].
In Ghana, like many other sub-Saharan African countries, structural barriers to vaccine acceptance are compounded by limited access to mental health services [18].
Many individuals with chronic conditions experience untreated depression and anxiety, which can negatively impact their perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy [19,20].
Social and cultural dynamics further shape vaccine behaviours.
Vaccine decisions are often influenced by communal attitudes rather than individual choices, with religious beliefs and trust in authority figures playing a significant role [21].
Stigma surrounding mental health conditions and chronic illnesses continues to deter individuals from seeking healthcare services, including vaccination [22].
In South Africa, depressive symptoms have been shown to contribute significantly to vaccine distrust and hesitancy [23].
Context-specific factors such as communal trust, institutional credibility, and cultural interpretations of illness also influence vaccine uptake.
In some cultural settings, heightened health concerns may lead to increased vaccine adoption [25].
Despite the recognised importance of vaccination for individuals with chronic conditions, mental health remains an underexplored factor in vaccine hesitancy [26].
Many health strategies fail to incorporate the psychological dimensions of vaccine refusal or consider how coping mechanisms influence health decisions [27].
The reciprocal relationship between chronic illness and mental health further complicates vaccine attitudes, as psychological distress may both result from and exacerbate chronic health problems [28,29].
It has been observed that once normalisation occurs, individuals may reduce emotional responses and transition into an adaptation stage [30].
Despite growing recognition of the intersection between chronic illness, mental health, and vaccine acceptance, there remains a critical gap in empirical evidence from low-resource settings, particularly in Ghana.
While global studies have demonstrated the influence of psychological factors on vaccine uptake, little is known about how mental health conditions and coping strategies jointly shape vaccine acceptance among individuals with chronic diseases in Ghanaian tertiary care settings [31].
Moreover, there is a practice gap in the integration of psychological support within vaccine communication strategies, especially in contexts with high disease burden and inadequate mental health infrastructure.
The aim of this study was to examine the influence of mental health conditions, specifically depression, anxiety, and stress, and coping strategies on vaccine acceptance among individuals with hypertension and/or diabetes in two tertiary facilities in the Central Region of Ghana.
The findings are expected to contribute to the growing discourse on context-specific interventions and highlight the importance of considering psychological and behavioural factors in public health vaccination campaigns.
A better understanding of these dynamics could inform culturally responsive and psychologically sensitive approaches to vaccine delivery in resource-constrained environments [24,32–36].
This study employed a cross-sectional descriptive design to explore the relationship between mental health issues, coping strategies, and vaccine acceptance among individuals with chronic conditions.
The research focused on individuals diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus receiving routine care at two tertiary-level health facilities: the Ankaful Leprosy/General Hospital and the Medical Outpatients’ Department (OPD) of Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital, both located in the Komenda Edina Eguafo Abirem (KEEA) Municipality in Ghana’s Central Region.
The research setting was selected purposively because Ankaful Leprosy/General Hospital and Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital serve as key referral centres for chronic disease management in the KEEA Municipality, providing consistent access to individuals diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes.
These two health facilities were purposively selected due to their provision of general medical services, including specialised care for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.
The study targeted adult patients (aged 18 years and above) who had a confirmed medical diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, or both, and who regularly accessed services at the designated clinics.
A census sampling approach was used, given the relatively manageable population size and the need for broad inclusion.
The estimated total population of eligible individuals receiving care at both facilities was 538.
All patients meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate during their scheduled clinic visits.
Of these, 457 participants consented and completed the study, yielding a response rate of approximately 85%.
This approach was deemed appropriate to enhance the representativeness of the sample and ensure that the findings accurately reflect the experiences and perspectives of individuals with chronic conditions in the selected healthcare settings.
Although the study focused on the influence of mental health issues such as anxiety and depression on vaccine acceptance, participants were selected based on their clinical diagnosis of hypertension and/or diabetes; no mental health screening was used as part of the inclusion criteria.
Participants provided sociodemographic information, including age, educational attainment, and duration of living with diabetes, hypertension, or comorbid conditions.
They also completed standardized assessments to evaluate psychological states and coping behaviors.
Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21): The DAS-21 is a21-item scale comprising three subscales measuring depression, anxiety, and stress severity [37].
Prior validation studies report high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α: depression = 0.94, anxiety = 0.87, stress = 0.91) [37].
For each subscale, scores were summed and multiplied by two, as per the standard procedure for the short-form version.
Examples of items on the scale include "I found it hard to wind down" (stress subscale), "I couldn’t seem to experience any positive feeling at all" (depression subscale), and "I felt scared without any good reason" (anxiety subscale).
The response set for DASS-21 was based on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Did not apply to me at all) to 3 (Applied to me very much or most of the time).
The resulting scores were then categorised into severity levels using the DASS severity ratings: Depression (Normal: 0–9, Mild: 10–13, Moderate: 14–20, Severe: 21–27, Extremely Severe: 28 +); Anxiety (Normal: 0–7, Mild: 8–9, Moderate: 10–14, Severe: 15–19, Extremely Severe: 20 +); and Stress (Normal: 0–14, Mild: 15–18, Moderate: 19–25, Severe: 26–33, Extremely Severe: 34 +).
Africultural Coping Systems Inventory (ACSI) was using to measure coping strategies of patients with chronic conditions [38].
Thus, this 30-item culturally grounded instrument assess coping strategies within African-centered frameworks, particularly problem- and emotion-focused approaches [38].
The ACSI is acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach’s α of > 0.70).
Examples of items on the scale include "I use prayer to help me cope" (spiritual-centered coping), "I talk to family members to get through tough times" (collective coping), and "I try to stay calm and think positively" (cognitive/emotional debriefing).
The response set for the Africultural Coping Systems Inventory (ACSI) was based on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Does not apply) to 3 (Applies very strongly).
Higher scores indicate better coping strategy.
COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale is a 12-item self-report measure evaluating attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions toward vaccination.
Examples of items on the scale include "I believe the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective," "I am willing to get vaccinated to protect myself and others," and "I trust the information provided by health authorities about the COVID-19 vaccine."
The response set for the COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale was based on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
This measure has an acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach’s α of 0.831) [25].
Before conducting the fieldwork, the researchers met with the clients to thoroughly explain the study's purpose and extend an invitation to potential participants.
They were given three days to decide whether to take part in the survey.
Those who agreed to participate provided informed consent by signing the participant information and consent form.
Individuals who consented were then purposefully engaged in the study.
Clear instructions were provided to participants on how to complete the surveys, which took approximately 12 to 30 min to complete.
For participants who could not read or write in English, the survey was administered through an interviewer-administered format.
The instrument was translated into Fante, the predominant local language in the study area, and then translated back into English to ensure accuracy and consistency in meaning across both versions.
This process was undertaken to enhance comprehension and maintain the validity of the data collected.
Data were gathered over a one-month period (October 1–31, 2023) by three trained research assistants using standardized protocols.
The study was conducted following guidelines in accordance with Helsinki Declaration.
Ethical clearance for the study was provided by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Cape Coast, Ghana (ID: UCCIRB/CES/2022/82).
This ethical approval was secured before the commencement of data collection.
Ethical approval was obtained from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before study commencement.
Informed consent was secured from all participants, with assurances regarding the confidentiality and anonymity of their responses.
Participants were also informed of their right to withdraw from the study without penalty.
Data were analysed using Jamovi version 2.6.23 software.
Descriptive statistics were computed to summarise the demographic characteristics of the participants.
Correlational analysis was done to assess the relationship among study variables while controlling for the socio-demographic variables of the participants.
Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted in three models to determine predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy.
Model 1 included demographic variables (age, gender, education level, and employment status).
Model 2 added mental health variables (anxiety, depression, and stress) to examine their impact beyond demographics.
Model 3 introduced coping strategies (spiritual coping, collective coping, cognitive-emotional debriefing, and ritual coping) to determine their additional influence.
Model fit was evaluated using Adjusted R2and Δ R2, with collinearity diagnostics checked through VIF and tolerance values.
Missing data were handled using listwise deletion, ensuring only cases with complete data for all variables in the respective analyses were included.
This approach helped maintain the integrity of the statistical models while minimising biases introduced by incomplete responses.
Table1presents the socio-demographic characteristics of participants engaged in the study.
The study included 457 participants from two healthcare facilities in the Central Region of Ghana, with 57.1% from Ankaful and 42.9% from Leprosarium Hospital, respectively.
The gender distribution was almost equal, with 50.8% female and 49.2% male.
The mean age of participants was 49.4 years (SD = 13.7).
Regarding marital status, 54.5% were married, 34.4% unmarried, and 11.2% divorced.
Educational attainment varied, with 42.9% having tertiary education, 33.3% basic education, 14.4% vocational education, and 9.4% having no formal education.
Regarding employment status, 36.1% were employed, 24.5% unemployed, and 39.4% self-employed.
Participants had lived with their chronic condition for varying durations: 46% for less than 5 years, 31.5% for 5–6 years, 13.1% for 6–10 years, and 9.4% for 10–15 years.
The most common chronic disease was hypertension (63.9%), followed by diabetes (36.1%).
Regarding religion, 86% were Christian, 10.7% Muslim, 1.5% Traditionalist, and 1.8% identified with other religions.
The analysis controlled for demographic and clinical factors, including facility, sex, age, marital status, education level, employment status, years with chronic conditions, and type of chronic condition, ensuring that these variables did not confound the observed associations.
Stress, anxiety, and depression exhibited strong positive correlations with one another (r = 0.773 to 0.779, p < 0.001), indicating that individuals experiencing higher stress levels also reported higher anxiety and depression.
Additionally, spiritual coping strategies showed significant negative correlations with stress (r = − 0.326, p < 0.001), anxiety (r = − 0.376, p < 0.001), and depression (r = − 0.452, p < 0.001).
Similarly, collective coping strategies were negatively associated with stress (r = − 0.201, p < 0.001), anxiety (r = − 0.234, p < 0.001), and depression (r = − 0.285, p < 0.001), while positively correlated with spiritual coping (r = 0.440, p < 0.001) and cognitive− emotional debriefing (r = 0.464, p < 0.001).
Cognitive-emotional debriefing had strong positive relationships with both spiritual (r = 0.613, p < 0.001) and collective coping strategies (r = 0.464, p < 0.001), reinforcing its role in psychological resilience.
Ritual coping strategies, though positively associated with collective coping (r = 0.401, p < 0.001) and cognitive-emotional debriefing (r = 0.339, p < 0.001), showed weaker or non-significant relationships with mental health variables.
COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy was significantly negatively correlated with stress (r = − 0.372, p < 0.001), anxiety (r = − 0.509, p < 0.001), and depression (r = − 0.503, p < 0.001).
Conversely, vaccine acceptancy was positively correlated with all coping strategies, particularly cognitive-emotional debriefing (r = 0.380, p < 0.001) and spiritual coping (r = 0.325, p < 0.001), suggesting that individuals who engaged in these coping mechanisms were more likely to accept vaccination.
The model fit statistics indicate that the hierarchical regression models demonstrated incremental improvements in explained variance by adding mental health and coping strategy variables.
In Model 1, demographic factors accounted for a small proportion of variance in COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy (Adjusted R2= 0.0611).
Including anxiety, depression, and stress in Model 2 substantially increased explanatory power (Adjusted R2= 0.4577, Δ R2= 0.3967, p < 0.001).
In Model 3, incorporating coping strategies resulted in a slight but significant increase in model fit (Adjusted R2= 0.4844, Δ R2= 0.0310, p < 0.001).
Collinearity statistics were within acceptable ranges across all models, suggesting no severe multicollinearity concerns.
In Model 1, tolerance values ranged from 0.88 to 0.96, with variance inflation factor (VIF) values between 1.04 and 1.14.
In Model 2, the inclusion of mental health variables led to slightly higher VIF values (ranging from 1.1 to 5.69), particularly for stress (VIF = 5.69) and depression (VIF = 5.04), though still within an acceptable range (< 10) (Hair et al., 2021).
In Model 3, the highest VIF values were observed for stress (VIF = 6.13) and depression (VIF = 5.70), indicating moderate multicollinearity but not to a level that would compromise the model's integrity (Hair et al., 2021).
The residual normality plot supports the assumption of normally distributed residuals, with most points aligning closely along the theoretical quantiles, though slight deviations were observed in the tails.
In Model 1, sex (β = 0.160, p < 0.001) and employment status (β = 0.182, p < 0.001) were positively associated with vaccine acceptancy, while education level negatively predicted vaccine acceptancy (β = − 0.132, p = 0.009).
Age did not significantly influence vaccine acceptancy (p = 0.974).
In Model 2 anxiety (β = − 0.439, p < 0.001) and depression (β = − 0.455, p < 0.001) were strong negative predictors of vaccine acceptancy, indicating that individuals with higher levels of these conditions were less likely to accept the vaccine.
In contrast, stress was positively associated with vaccine acceptancy (β = 0.172, p = 0.044), suggesting that individuals experiencing stress may have been more inclined to receive the vaccine.
Notably, gender remained a significant predictor, but its direction changed (β = − 0.145, p < 0.001), suggesting that when mental health issues were considered, men were less likely to accept the vaccine than women.
Model 3 introduced coping strategies.
Among the coping strategies, only cognitive and emotional debriefing was a significant positive predictor of vaccine acceptancy (β = 0.129, p = 0.012).
Spiritual coping (β = − 0.004, p = 0.938), collective coping (β = 0.060, p = 0.205), and ritual coping (β = 0.076, p = 0.077) did not significantly contribute to vaccine acceptancy.
The previously observed relationships between anxiety (β = − 0.359, p < 0.001), depression (β = − 0.330, p < 0.001), and vaccine acceptancy remained strong, while stress became non-significant (β = 0.089, p = 0.305).
Gender (β = − 0.120, p = 0.004) and education level (β = − 0.136, p < 0.001) remained significant, indicating that males and individuals with higher education levels continued to show lower vaccine acceptancy even after accounting for mental health and coping strategies (Tables2,3).
The study found that stress, anxiety, and depression were strongly interrelated, with higher levels of psychological distress linked to lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy.
Coping strategies, particularly cognitive-emotional debriefing, were positively associated with vaccine acceptancy, while spiritual, collective, and ritual coping strategies had no significant effect.
Hierarchical regression analysis showed that adding mental health variables significantly improved the model’s explanatory power, with anxiety and depression emerging as strong negative predictors of vaccine acceptance.
Including coping strategies slightly enhanced the model, with cognitive-emotional debriefing being the only significant coping factor.
Gender and education level remained consistent predictors, with men and individuals with higher education levels showing lower vaccine acceptancy.
The relationship between psychological distress and COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy reveals complex interactions between mental health, coping mechanisms, and sociodemographic factors.
Recent studies highlight that anxiety and depression are strongly associated with reduced vaccine acceptance.
For instance, higher COVID-19-related anxiety and fear were linked to lower vaccine hesitancy in Saudi populations, suggesting heightened health concerns may drive vaccine uptake in some cultural settings [23].
Also, generalised anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms have been associated with increased acceptance globally, particularly when linked to distrust in vaccine safety or efficacy [23].
The influence of psychological distress on vaccine acceptance may also be shaped by misinformation exposure and cognitive biases, reinforcing hesitancy or heightening the urgency to get vaccinated [39].
Moreover, individuals experiencing high levels of distress may rely more on social networks or authoritative figures for health decisions, making public health messaging and community engagement crucial in addressing vaccine concerns [23].
In Ghana, where access to mental health services remains limited, individuals with chronic conditions may experience heightened psychological distress that complicates vaccine-related decisions.
This makes it crucial to integrate mental health support into vaccination efforts and tailor communication strategies to address emotional vulnerability and build trust, particularly in tertiary healthcare settings.
Cognitive-emotional debriefing, a coping strategy involving structured reflection on stressors, emerges as a positive predictor of vaccine acceptance.
Studies on individuals with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) found that proactive coping mechanisms, such as evidence-based health information seeking, adopting new skills for symptom management, and goal-oriented planning, improved mental resilience and health-related decision-making [23,31].
In contrast, spiritual or collective coping strategies showed no statistically significant impact, potentially due to their focus on externalised control rather than problem-solving [32].
Furthermore, the role of cognitive-emotional debriefing in vaccine acceptance suggests that structured reflection mitigates psychological distress and enhances individuals’ perceived control over their health choices [23].
This aligns with findings that individuals actively engaging in self-monitoring and adaptive learning from past health experiences are more likely to make informed and preventive health decisions [31].
Additionally, the limited impact of spiritual or collective coping strategies may highlight the need for integrating structured cognitive-behavioural interventions within community-based health campaigns to reinforce problem-solving and evidence-based decision-making [32].
The findings suggest that individuals who engage in cognitive-emotional debriefing may experience a greater sense of control over their health, which can positively influence vaccine acceptance.
This contrasts with spiritual or collective coping, which may rely more on external factors and offer less direct engagement with the decision-making process.
In the context of chronic illness, where perceived vulnerability is high, coping strategies that promote self-reflection and adaptive learning appear more closely aligned with preventive health behaviours like vaccination.
Hierarchical regression analyses from multiple studies confirm that mental health variables significantly enhance predictive models of vaccine hesitancy.
Anxiety and depression collectively explain substantial variance in vaccine attitudes, with anxiety-reducing acceptance by amplifying perceived risks of side effects [5,6,40].
Gender disparities persist, with men consistently exhibiting lower vaccine acceptance than women, possibly due to differences in health-seeking behaviours or risk perception [14,17].
Education-related patterns are context-dependent; while higher education correlates with reduced hesitancy in low-income countries (attributed to better health literacy), in high-income settings, greater education sometimes predicts hesitancy due to heightened scrutiny of vaccine information [12].
Moreover, the interplay between education and vaccine hesitancy underscores the role of information processing styles, where highly educated individuals in high-income settings may engage in deeper but sometimes more sceptical evaluations of vaccine-related data [32].
Additionally, the influence of anxiety on risk perception suggests that targeted interventions addressing both emotional and cognitive biases, such as fear-based misinformation, could be crucial in mitigating hesitancy and fostering informed vaccine decision-making [30].
The hierarchical regression findings highlight the complex psychological and demographic dynamics underpinning vaccine hesitancy.
The consistent role of anxiety and depression in shaping vaccine attitudes suggests that emotional states significantly colour risk perception, often outweighing factual knowledge.
The contrasting influence of education across contexts reflects not just access to information but how individuals process and evaluate it, with more educated groups sometimes engaging in critical appraisal that may fuel scepticism.
These patterns indicate that vaccine hesitancy is not merely a function of knowledge deficits but also of how emotional and cognitive processes interact with social positioning and perceived vulnerability.
In this study, stress was not a statistically significant predictor of vaccine acceptance, likely due to its complex and context-dependent effects on decision-making and behaviour.
Vaccination-related stress decreases over time, especially after individuals access accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information.
For instance, a study in China found that psychological stress about COVID-19 vaccination significantly declined as people gained more information or after vaccination, reducing its long-term influence on the vaccine [34].
Collective coping was not a statistically significant predictor of vaccine acceptance, likely because its effectiveness depends on the broader social and cultural context, which can vary widely.
Research suggests that collective coping strategies, such as relying on group norms or community-driven actions, are most impactful in environments with high trust in institutions, strong social cohesion, and shared perceptions of collective responsibility [30].
However, in contexts where trust in public institutions or government-led vaccination campaigns is low, collective coping may fail to influence individual vaccine decisions effectively.
For example, societal factors like institutional trust and family influences in Hong Kong were stronger predictors of vaccine acceptance than broader community-based norms, especially in a low-trust environment [30].
The lack of a significant relationship between stress and vaccine acceptance in this study indicates the role of stress as both a motivator and inhibitor, depending on timing, context, and the availability of accurate information.
As stress levels decline with increased knowledge and exposure to vaccination, its influence on decision-making may diminish.
Similarly, the non-significant role of collective coping may reflect underlying contextual factors such as institutional trust and perceived social responsibility.
In environments with fragmented trust or weak collective efficacy, community norms may carry less weight in shaping health behaviours, highlighting the importance of socio-political context in understanding coping influences on vaccine uptake.
Integrating mental health support into vaccine promotion strategies is crucial for improving acceptance among individuals with chronic conditions.
Healthcare providers should adopt a patient-centred approach that includes psychological screening and counselling to address vaccine-related fears and misinformation.
Public health campaigns must incorporate culturally tailored interventions that leverage trusted community figures, such as religious and local leaders, to address stigma and enhance vaccine confidence.
Additionally, structured cognitive-emotional debriefing techniques should be incorporated into health education programs to help individuals process concerns and develop proactive coping mechanisms.
From a policy and research perspective, there is a need for stronger intersectoral collaboration between mental health services and immunisation programs to address the psychosocial barriers to vaccine uptake.
Policymakers should prioritise funding for mental health interventions within broader vaccination initiatives, particularly in resource-limited settings where stigma and misinformation remain pervasive.
Future research should explore the long-term effects of psychological distress on vaccine acceptance and examine how various coping strategies evolve over time.
Additionally, longitudinal studies assessing the effectiveness of targeted interventions, such as digital mental health support and behavioural nudges, can provide evidence for refining public health strategies aimed at reducing vaccine hesitancy.
This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings.
First, the cross-sectional design prevents establishing causality between mental health variables, coping strategies, and vaccine acceptancy, limiting the ability to assess changes over time.
Additionally, self-reported measures may introduce social desirability bias, as participants might have provided responses they perceived as favourable rather than reflecting their actual attitudes.
The study was also conducted in specific healthcare facilities, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader populations with chronic conditions outside clinical settings.
The absence of baseline screening for psychological distress among potential participants limits the ability to directly capture individuals with diagnosed anxiety or depression, despite the relevance of these variables to the study's objectives.
Furthermore, while the study accounted for key sociodemographic variables, unmeasured factors such as prior vaccine experiences, trust in healthcare systems, and cultural beliefs could have influenced vaccine acceptancy.
Lastly, reliance on translated survey instruments introduces potential discrepancies in interpretation despite efforts to ensure accuracy through back-translation.
Future research should consider longitudinal designs and more diverse sampling strategies to enhance the robustness of findings.
The findings from this study suggest that mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression, play a significant role in shaping vaccine acceptancy among individuals with chronic conditions.
The data indicate that higher levels of psychological distress are associated with lower vaccine acceptance, while cognitive-emotional debriefing emerges as a positive predictor.
However, spiritual, collective, and ritual coping strategies did not show statistically significant effects on vaccine uptake.
Gender and educational attainment also remain influential factors, with males and individuals with higher education levels demonstrating lower vaccine acceptance.
The results highlight the need for targeted mental health interventions within vaccination campaigns, particularly in populations with chronic illnesses.
Given the observed associations, integrating psychological support into public health strategies could improve vaccine confidence, though further research is needed to explore how these relationships evolve over time and across different contexts.
