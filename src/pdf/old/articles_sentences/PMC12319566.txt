Dapagliflozin (DAPA), a sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, may attenuate the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) through its antiarrhythmic properties in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
The antiarrhythmic mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors are not fully known.
Recently, the index of cardiac electrophysiological balance (ICEB) has been posited as a robust indicator for predicting VA risk.
ICEB reflects the balance between ventricular depolarization and repolarization.
This study was conducted to investigate the effects of DAPA treatment on ICEB in a cohort of patients with HFrEF.
A total of 235 HFrEF patients undergoing DAPA treatment were enrolled in the study.
Each participant underwent a comprehensive 12‐lead electrocardiography (ECG) assessment prior to treatment initiation and approximately 6 months posttreatment.
ICEB values were compared before and after treatment.
The analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in the QT interval (427.51 ± 13.87 vs. 347.75 ± 11.21 ms,p< 0.001), corrected QT interval (QTc) (458.34 ± 29.71 vs. 393.37 ± 13.21 ms,p< 0.001), T peak‐to‐end (Tp‐e) interval (85.41 ± 3.52 vs. 71.18 ± 3.16 ms,p< 0.001), Tp‐e/QTc ratio (0.186 ± 0.009 vs. 0.180 ± 0.003,p< 0.001), ICEB (4.59 ± 0.65 vs. 3.77 ± 0.15,p< 0.001), following approximately 6 months of DAPA treatment.
In addition to ventricular repolarization distribution indices, the regression of the ICEB values after DAPA treatment in patients with HFrEF shows that DAPA treatment improves the balance between ventricular depolarization and repolarization and reduces the risk of VA in these patients.
Sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor confers cardioprotective effects in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and may attenuate the risk of sudden cardiac death through its antiarrhythmic properties.
However, the precise mechanisms underpinning the antiarrhythmic potential of SGLT2 inhibitors remain incompletely characterized.
This study was conducted to investigate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on ventricular depolarization and depolarization.
Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) face a markedly heightened risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), predominantly attributed to ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (Koplan and Stevenson2009; Singh et al.1997).
As such, exploring the impact of novel therapeutic interventions on VA and SCD in this vulnerable population is of paramount importance.
Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in mitigating both the progression of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality among patients with HFrEF.
Dapagliflozin (DAPA), a member of this pharmacological class, has been shown to significantly curtail hospital admissions and reduce cardiovascular mortality in comparison to placebo (McMurray et al.2019).
Similarly, empagliflozin has demonstrated a substantial reduction in cardiovascular mortality in heart failure populations.
Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors confer protection against cardiac arrhythmias and SCD (Zelniker et al.2020; Chen et al.2020; Persson et al.2018).
However, the precise mechanisms underpinning these potential antiarrhythmic effects remain elusive.
Prolonged ventricular repolarization has been strongly linked to an elevated risk of VA (Vaughan Williams1985).
This physiological parameter can be quantified through conventional 12‐lead electrocardiography (ECG) parameters such as QT dispersion, QT interval, and T‐wave measurements (Castro Hevia et al.2006).
Recent investigations have identified the T peak‐to‐end (Tp‐e) interval as a reliable surrogate for the overall dispersion of repolarization (Antzelevitch et al.2007).
Moreover, an extended Tp‐e interval has been correlated with an increased propensity for VA and mortality (Panikkath et al.2011), prompting the recognition of the Tp‐e/QT ratio as an independent marker of ventricular repolarization integrity.
Studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors elicit favorable effects on ventricular repolarization parameters, including QT, corrected QT (QTc), Tp‐e interval, and Tp‐e/QT ratio, in patients with HFrEF.
The index of cardiac electrophysiological balance (ICEB), a novel biomarker for VA prediction, is derived by dividing the QT interval by the QRS duration (QT/QRS) (Lu et al.2013).
This index reflects the balance between ventricular depolarization and repolarization.
ICEB, wavelengthλwhich is an electrophysiological measurement, is considered equivalent to ICEB.
ICEB has the advantage of being non‐invasive and easy to measure (Robyns et al.2016).
ICEB provides more information about the prediction of VA than the other ECG parameters (QT, QTc, Tp‐e, etc.).
To our knowledge, the influence of DAPA treatment on ICEB, a prognostic marker for VA, has yet to be elucidated in heart failure populations.
This investigation seeks to illuminate the effect of DAPA treatment on ICEB in patients with HFrEF, thereby advancing our understanding of its electrophysiological implications.
The investigation was conceptualized as a retrospective analysis of archival documentation and electronic database retrieval.
A cohort of 264 sequential patients with HFrEF (EF ≤ 35%) under outpatient surveillance at the cardiology department of a tertiary medical institution was retrospectively scrutinized between January 2021 and September 2024.
These individuals were classified within New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes 1–3, receiving guideline‐directed optimal pharmacotherapy, and were newly started on a daily regimen of 10 mg DAPA.
Participants exhibiting baseline serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 mg/dL were excluded from the study.
Out of the initially considered 264 patients, 21 were excluded from the final dataset for the following reasons: eight developed acute kidney injury, defined as an elevation in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h, ≥ 50% within 7 days, or a urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h for > 6 h; four succumbed to SCD; and nine discontinued SGLT2 inhibitor treatment during follow‐up due to nonadherence or financial hardships.
Also, those with left or right branch bundle block confirmed by electrocardiography, thyroid dysfunction, rheumatoid heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, anemia, electrolyte disorder, liver disease, acute or chronic infection, atrioventricular conduction disorder, non‐sinus rhythm confirmed by electrocardiography, patients with systemic autoimmune disease as well as those using antidepressant, antipsychotic, antihistaminic, or antiarrhythmic drugs were excluded from the study.
According to these criteria, eight individuals were excluded from the study.
Ultimately, 235 patients were deemed eligible for inclusion in the analytic cohort.
Ethical approval was procured from the institutional review board (The Ethics Committee, Adiyaman University, approval number: 2024/9‐7).
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
The present study was done in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
Demographic, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic parameters for all participants were meticulously extracted from clinical follow‐up encounters, patient medical records, and institutional electronic databases.
The 12‐lead ECG tracings and mean N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) concentrations from baseline and approximately 6‐month follow‐up assessments were subjected to thorough evaluation.
Diabetes mellitus was operationally defined as a fasting plasma glucose level > 126 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%, or a documented history of antidiabetic therapy.
Hypertension was delineated as a blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg during at least three different measurements or a prior history of antihypertensive treatment.
Hyperlipidemia was characterized by a total cholesterol level ≥ 200 mg/dL or antecedent initiation of statin therapy.
The standard 12‐lead electrocardiograph (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) was calibrated to a paper speed of 50 mm/s and a sensitivity of 10 mm/mV.
Electrocardiographic recordings were obtained with patients in the supine position, ensuring all subjects exhibited sinus rhythm.
The heart rate was derived from the ECG tracings, while additional parameters, including the Tp‐e interval, QRS duration, and QT interval, were meticulously measured.
To minimize measurement inaccuracies, a magnifying lens was employed.
Data acquisition was primarily conducted using leads V5 and II.
The QT interval was delineated as the segment extending from the onset of the QRS complex to the termination of the T wave.
The QTc was subsequently calculated using Bazett's formula: QTc = QTR−Rinterval(Bazett2006).
Based on these measurements, derived indices such as Tp‐e/QTc, QT/QRS (ICEB), and QTc/QRS (ICEBc) were computed and analyzed.
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a Vivid 5 ultrasound system (General Electric, Horten, Norway) equipped with a 2.5 MHz transducer.
Patients were positioned in the left lateral decubitus orientation to optimize imaging conditions.
Continuous monitoring was maintained throughout the echocardiographic examination.
The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using Simpson's biplane method (Schiller et al.1989), ensuring accurate assessment of systolic function.
Statistical evaluations were executed utilizing SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation, whereas categorical variables are expressed as percentages.
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was employed to ascertain the normality of data distribution.
To assess differences in mean NT‐proBNP levels, NYHA functional class, and electrocardiographic indices before and after the initiation of DAPA treatment, a paired‐samplest‐test was applied.
Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis was utilized to investigate the relationships among various parameters.
Ap‐value of less than 0.05 was deemed indicative of statistical significance.
The demographic and clinical attributes of the study cohort are delineated in Table1.
The cohort's mean age was 58.21 ± 8.43 years, with male representation comprising 62.5%.
The average body mass index (BMI) was calculated as 28.2 ± 3.4 kg/m2.
The mean LVEF was 27.84% ± 3.95%, and the baseline NYHA functional classification prior to DAPA treatment was 2.04 ± 0.30.
Within the cohort, 43.4% of participants reported smoking, 36.5% had a diagnosis of hypertension, 40.4% exhibited dyslipidemia, and 33.2% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
Ischemic etiology of heart failure was observed in 84.2% of the participants.
Regarding pharmacotherapy, 92.3% were prescribed beta‐blockers, 94.8% were on angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 35.7% utilized thiazide diuretics, and 80.4% were administered mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.
The mean daily total furosemide dosage was recorded as 30.5 ± 26.8 mg.

Comparison of functional class, blood parameters, and electrocardiographic findings before and after approximately 6 months of DAPA treatment were presented in Table2.
A statistically significant enhancement in NYHA functional capacity was noted posttreatment (2.04 ± 0.30 vs. 1.78 ± 0.60,p< 0.001).
Likewise, NT‐proBNP levels demonstrated a significant reduction (2842.4 ± 2113.2 vs. 2480.3 ± 1584.6,p= 0.002).
Serum concentrations of potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, creatinine, hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), HbA1c, and triglycerides remained statistically unchanged posttreatment (p> 0.05 for all).
However, a significant decline in non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) (p< 0.05) and a concomitant increase in high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) (p< 0.05) were observed.

Heart rate and QRS durations did not exhibit significant variations pre‐ and post‐DAPA treatment (p> 0.05 for both).
A statistically significant decrease was observed in QT (427.51 ± 13.87 vs. 347.75 ± 11.21 ms,p< 0.001), QTc (458.34 ± 29.71 vs. 393.37 ± 13.21 ms,p< 0.001), Tp‐e (85.41 ± 3.52 vs. 71.18 ± 3.16 ms,p< 0.001), Tp‐e/QTc (0.186 ± 0.009 vs. 0.180 ± 0.003,p< 0.001), ICEB (4.59 ± 0.65 vs. 3.77 ± 0.15,p< 0.001) and ICEBc (4.91 ± 0.93 vs. 4.26 ± 0.13,p< 0.001) after approximately 6 months of DAPA treatment.
Additionally, correlation analysis showed a statistically significant positive relationship between NT‐proBNP and QT (r= 0.206,p= 0.024), QTc (r= 0.186,p= 0.041), Tp‐e (r= 0.194,p= 0.032), Tp‐e/QTc (r= 0.256,p= 0.005), ICEB (r= 0.213,p= 0.020), and ICEBc (r= 0.246,p= 0.007) (Table3).

Abbreviations: iCEB, index of cardio electrophysiological balance; iCEBc, corrected iCEB; QTc, corrected QT interval; Tp‐e, T wave peak‐to‐end.
In addition to ventricular repolarization distribution indices, the regression of the ICEB and ICEBc values after DAPA treatment was observed in patients with HFrEF in our study.
Our results show that DAPA treatment improves the balance between ventricular depolarization and repolarization and reduces the risk of VA in these patients.
Additionally, improvement in NHYA functional capacity and decline in NT‐proBNP levels were observed.
Correlation analysis showed a statistically significant positive relationship between NT‐proBNP, QT, QTc, Tp‐e, Tp‐e/QTc, ICEB, and ICEBc.
To our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature investigating the effect of DAPA treatment on ICEB.
Heart failure represents a pervasive contributor to both morbidity and mortality.
While epidemiological trends indicate a stabilization or decline in heart failure, the prevalence of hospitalizations and fatalities associated with the condition remains unabated (Khwaja2012).
Among HF patients, cardiac arrhythmias are a predominant cause of mortality (McMurray et al.2019; Packer et al.2020; Armstrong et al.2020).
Thus, the elucidation of novel therapeutic interventions to attenuate the risks of VA and SCD is paramount.
Numerous studies have implicated augmented ventricular repolarization parameters, such as QT, QTc, Tp‐e, Tp‐e/QT, and Tp‐e/QTc, in the heightened risk of VA (Kuyumcu et al.2020; Kaya and Barutcu2019; Zehir et al.2015).
Conversely, amelioration of these indices has been associated with diminished arrhythmic risk (Okutucu et al.2020).
However, one intrinsic limitation of utilizing Tp‐e and QT intervals lies in their sole reflection of the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential.
The ICEB, calculated by dividing the QT interval by the QRS duration, encapsulates a more holistic representation of the cardiac action potential by encompassing both depolarization and repolarization dynamics.
This dual‐phase integration renders ICEB a superior predictor of proarrhythmic risk compared to parameters such as Tp‐e or QT intervals (Lu et al.2013).
Notably, elevated ICEB values have been correlated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias (Yumurtacı et al.2017; Sivri and Celik2019; Yücetas et al.2022).
The cardioprotective properties of SGLT2 inhibitors have garnered substantial attention, as evidenced by multiple cardiovascular studies.
DAPA and other SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations (Curtain et al.2021).
Li et al. highlighted a decreased incidence of atrial flutter/fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in individuals receiving SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo (Li et al.2021).
Similarly, a separate study indicated a 17% reduction in newly diagnosed arrhythmias among diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitors (Chen et al.2020).
Contrastingly, the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial noted a marginally elevated incidence of atrial fibrillation in the empagliflozin cohort, though the difference was not statistically significant (Böhm et al.2020).
Özen et al. found that there was an improvement in Tp‐e and Tp‐e/QT values, which are ventricular repolarization indexes, in patients with HFrEF who were started on SGLT2; they claimed that SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce the risk of VA (Özen et al.2024).
Similarly, significant improvement was observed in Tp‐e, QT, and Tp‐e/QT values after DAPA treatment in our study.
Tp‐e and QT intervals only provide information about ventricular repolarization.
Unlike the study by Özen et al., in our study, ICEB, which provides information about both ventricular depolarization and repolarization, was evaluated, and a significant improvement in ICEB values was observed after DAPA treatment.
The precise mechanisms underlying the antiarrhythmic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors remain elusive.
Potential pathways include reductions in cardiac chamber dimensions, lower NT‐proBNP levels via diuretic effects, attenuation of myocardial stress, and suppression of adverse remodeling (Omar et al.2020,2021; Jensen et al.2020; Santos‐Gallego et al.2021; Lee et al.2021).
NT‐proBNP, a robust biomarker for pump failure mortality, has been positively associated with QT, QTc, Tp‐e, and Tp‐e/QTc indices in prior studies (Shen et al.2021).
In a recent study, Koc et al. found that NT‐proBNP levels had a significant positive relationship with Tp‐e, Tp‐e/QT, and Tp‐e/QTc (Koc et al.2020) Similarly, our study showed a significant positive relationship between NT‐proBNP levels and QT, QTc, Tp‐e, and Tp‐e/QTc.
Additionally, unlike Koc et al., our study showed that there was a positive significant relationship between ICEB and ICEBc values and NT‐proBNP levels.
The primary reason for the improvement in QT, QTc, Tp‐e, and Tp‐e/QTc, ICEB, and ICEBc values in our study may be that DAPA treatment provides improvement in NT‐proBNP levels by reducing wall stress due to its diuretic effects in patients with HFrEF.
Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors may have positive effects on the autonomic nervous system.
Empagliflozin has been reported to improve both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in myocardial infarction patients with diabetes (Shimizu et al.2020).
The results of this study were supported by another study conducted with DAPA (Zhang et al.2019).
Afsin et al. indicated that the Tp‐e/QT ratio and Tp‐e interval increased among patients with panic disorder and suggested that this might be due to the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system through elevated sympathetic activity (Afsin et al.2020).
Similarly, it has been reported that Tp‐e and Tp‐e/QT values increased in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, which might be due to increased sympathetic activity (Kaya and Barutcu2019).
The second reason for the improvement in QT, QTc, Tp‐e, and Tp‐e/QTc, ICEB, and ICEBc values in our study may be the positive effects of DAPA treatment on the autonomic nervous system.
Moreover, inhibition of myocardial sodium/hydrogen exchange by SGLT2 inhibitors has been linked to reductions in hypertrophy, fibrosis, and adverse remodeling, coupled with improved systolic function (Packer et al.2017).
The third reason for the improvement in QT, QTc, Tp‐e, and Tp‐e/QTc, ICEB, and ICEBc in our study may be the result of this effect of SGLT2 inhibitors.
DAPA treatment has been shown to reduce epicardial adipose tissue volume and P wave dispersion (Sato et al.2020).
Epicardial adipose tissue has been shown to be positively associated with ventricular repolarization indices used to predict VA (Kaplan et al.2015).
The reduction in epicardial adipose tissue with DAPA therapy may represent an additional mechanistic explanation for the improved electrophysiological profile observed in our study cohort.
Our study has several limitations.
The most important limitations of our study were its retrospective design, relatively small sample size, short follow‐up period, and lack of a control group.
The use of only one study center and the lack of follow‐up of patients for SCD or malignant VA were other important limitations.
As a result, in this retrospective cohort study, we observed a statistically significant improvement in repolarization parameters (Tp‐e interval, Tp‐e/QT, and Tp‐e/QTc ratios) and ICEB values, which reflect the balance between ventricular depolarization and repolarization with the initiation and maintenance of DAPA therapy in patients with HFrEF.
The antiarrhythmic mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors are still not fully known.
Previous studies have evaluated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on ventricular repolarization parameters.
Unlike previous studies, in our study, for the first time in the literature, the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on ICEB, which reflects the balance between ventricular depolarization and repolarization, were evaluated.
According to our study results, SGLT2 inhibitors may have positive effects not only on the ventricular repolarization phase but also on the depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential.
Our results will need further validation in larger and more comprehensive studies.
