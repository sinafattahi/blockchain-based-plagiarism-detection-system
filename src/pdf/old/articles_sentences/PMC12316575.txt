While socioeconomic factors affect school absenteeism, the role of untreated oral disease remains largely overlooked.
Despite declining caries rates in Australia, disparities persist among children and adolescents.
This study aimed to identify factors associated with oral disease risk among school‐aged children using school‐based assessments and caregiver‐reported behaviors.
A cross‐sectional analysis of retrospectively collected data from 290 children aged 5–18 was conducted.
Oral health assessments recorded caries, restorations, and calculus, while caregiver questionnaires captured demographics, dental history, snacking habits, and oral care practices.
Data were analyzed using SPSS with descriptive statistics, Chi‐Square tests, and logistic regression to identify significant associations.
Thirty‐six percent of students had restorations and/or untreated caries.
Older children (13–18 years) were over three times more likely to have caries (OR = 3.35).
A history of dental problems (OR = 3.49,p< 0.001) and parental concern (OR = 1.36,p= 0.024) were associated with increased risk.
Frequent water intake was protective (OR = 0.83,p= 0.001), while sugar‐sweetened beverages increased caries risk (p= 0.015).
Surprisingly, frequent sweet snack consumption was linked to fewer restorations (OR = 0.54).
Findings support the value of school‐based programs addressing modifiable oral health risks.
Oral diseases contribute to school absenteeism and hinder academic outcomes, particularly among disadvantaged children.
Untreated dental caries persists due to limited program reach, low awareness, and barriers to access.
Incorporating oral health screening into existing school well‐being initiatives can support early identification and timely referral of at‐risk children.
Socioeconomic factors are well recognized as major contributors to school absenteeism and academic challenges, yet the impact of untreated oral disease remains frequently overlooked (Rebelo et al.2019; Ruff et al.2019).
Children suffering from untreated dental problems experience pain, difficulty eating, and trouble concentrating, all of which can negatively affect their ability to learn (Watt et al.2018).
Despite advancements in dental care and prevention, oral disease remains one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood, affecting not just physical health but also school participation and overall well‐being (Peres et al.2019).
Poor oral health during these formative years can have enduring consequences, persisting into adulthood and significantly affecting quality of life (Watt et al.2024).
Although the overall prevalence of dental caries among Australian children and adolescents has declined (Do and Spencer2016), this improvement has not been evident among all child population groups.
A complex interaction of personal, socioeconomic, and cultural factors continues to place some children at increased risk of pain, infection, and long‐term oral health complications (AIHW2022).
Identifying and managing these at‐risk children early is essential to preventing disease progression and reducing health disparities.
National programs such as the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS) (Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care2024) and the Mobile Dental Outreach Program (MDOP) aim to reduce disparities in children's oral health in Australia (Balasubramanian et al.2023).
The CDBS offers capped benefits every 2 years for basic dental services; not all children aged 5–18 are eligible.
The MDOP delivers school‐based screenings and preventive care across NSW, prioritizing schools with a lower Index of Community Socio‐Educational Advantage (ICSEA) scores (Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority2020).
While effective in reaching the most disadvantaged schools, this targeting can leave out vulnerable children in schools with slightly higher ICSEA scores.
Despite the availability of free public dental services for children under 18, many families are unaware of these services and face barriers such as language, cost, and system navigation difficulties (Paisi et al.2020; Straiton and Myhre2017).
This gap highlights the need for complementary strategies to identify and support at‐risk children who may be overlooked by current programs.
Given these limitations, there is a growing need for innovative, practical strategies that integrate oral health with broader student wellbeing initiatives.
This study adds to the evidence base by analyzing routinely collected school‐based oral health assessment data to identify risk patterns and supports more inclusive screening and referral processes.
Programs like the Wellbeing and Health In‐reach Nurse (WHIN) initiative, designed to address student health and social needs, are well‐positioned to help bridge dental access gaps.
Leveraging such existing structures to incorporate oral health screening can facilitate earlier intervention and better health outcomes.
This cross‐sectional study analyzed school‐based oral health assessment records and caregiver‐reported data to identify key factors associated with oral disease risk among school‐age children and adolescents.
By examining modifiable risk factors and addressing gaps in access to preventive care, the findings aim to inform the development of more inclusive, more sustainable school‐based preventive strategies, ensuring that at‐risk children, regardless of their school's ICSEA classification, receive the necessary support to maintain optimum oral health.
This study employed a retrospective cross‐sectional design, analyzing existing data from school‐based oral health assessments conducted as part of routine clinical practice within a public health oral screening program.
While the data were collected prospectively at the time of assessment, they were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed for research purposes.
This evaluation aimed to explore associations between demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables and oral health outcomes to inform school‐based oral health strategies.
Data for this study were obtained from the Titanium electronic dental record database and included records from May 2023 to September 2024.
This study focused on the students enrolled in public schools participating in the NSW WHIN Coordinator program (NSW Health2024), a partnership between NSW Health and the NSW Department of Education aimed at improving education, health, and wellbeing outcomes for students and families.
The WHIN program emphasizes building trusting relationships with students and their families to identify and assess their health and wellbeing needs while addressing barriers to accessing services, ensuring that students receive the support necessary to thrive both academically and personally.
Data were collected from two sources: (1) school‐based oral health assessments by trained oral health professionals and (2) caregiver‐completed questionnaires.
To ensure precision and consistency, the chief investigator conducted the data abstraction using a pre‐defined protocol.
This protocol was developed to standardize the extraction process by providing clear steps for locating, interpreting, and coding clinical and demographic data.
Categorical responses from clinical records were translated into consistent numerical codes suitable for SPSS analysis.
A standardized abstraction form and checklist guided data entry to ensure uniformity across variables.
The coding process was piloted on 20 student records, allowing the researcher to identify ambiguous items, refine coding categories, and modify the abstraction tool prior to full‐scale extraction.
Questionnaire responses were pre‐coded numerically at the point of data collection, facilitating direct entry into the analysis software.
Demographics—age, gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, primary language spoken at home, and medical history.
Dental history—previous dental problems, timing and location of the last dental visit, and receipt of fluoride treatment or X‐rays in the past 6 months (note: reason for visit not captured).
Oral hygiene and diet—toothbrushing frequency, type of toothpaste used, daily water intake, and frequency of sweet snack and sugar‐sweetened beverage consumption.
These data were analyzed alongside clinical findings to explore associations with oral health outcomes.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant demographics, oral health behaviors, and clinical outcomes.
Chi‐Square tests explored bivariate associations between categorical variables (e.g., age group, gender, brushing frequency, sugar intake, and dental visit history) and clinical indicators (untreated dental caries, restorations, and calculus).
Dental caries risk—defined as the presence of untreated caries and/or restorations, consistent with literature recognizing restorations as markers of both past disease and ongoing behavioral and biological risk factors, such as poor dietary habits and inadequate oral hygiene, that contribute to the caries recurrence (Featherstone2000; Harris et al.2004).
Explanatory variables included age group (5–12 vs. 13–18 years), gender, brushing frequency, toothpaste type, dietary habits, water intake, self‐rated oral health, and dental history.
Variables with ap‐value < 0.10 in the bivariate analysis were included in the regression models, entered simultaneously using the forced entry method.
Model fit was assessed using NagelkerkeR2, and results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals andp‐values.
The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 29, IBM SPSS Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Statistical significance was defined asp< 0.05.
Table1summarizes the key characteristics of all variables included in the analysis.
The study sample consisted of 290 students, categorized into two age groups: 216 students aged 5–12 years and 74 students aged 13–18 years.
The gender distribution was 42% female (n= 91) and 58% male (n= 125).
Regarding medical conditions, one parent/caregiver (< 1%) reported their child having autism, and one parent/caregiver (< 1%) reported their child experiencing anxiety.
No students had a reported diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, epilepsy, global developmental delay, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, or other medical conditions.
All participants either had no medical conditions or one medical condition, and none were reported to be on medication or had any form of disability.
Among the 5–12‐year‐old group, 30% (n= 65) reported a history of past dental problems, while 26% (n= 19) of the 13–18‐year‐olds had similar issues, resulting in a combined total of 29% (n= 84) across both groups.
In terms of dental visits, 60% (n= 130) of younger children and 64% (n= 47) of older students had visited a dentist in the past 12 months, totaling 61% (n= 177) across both groups.
A smaller percentage, 25% (n= 54) in the younger group and 27% (n= 20) in the older group had visited more than 12 months ago, with a combined 26% (n= 74) overall.
Furthermore, 10% (n= 28) had never visited a dentist, with 3% (n= 9) being unsure of their dental history.
Regarding the location of the last visit, 65% (n= 141) of younger children and 74% (n= 55) of older students visited a public dental service, yielding a total of 68% (n= 196).
Fewer students attended private clinics (13%,n= 37), while 3% (n= 10) visited other places, 1% (n= 4) saw a specialist, and 5% (n= 15) were unsure.
Among the 5–12 year‐old students, 10% consumed sweet drinks daily, 48% a few times a week, and 40% rarely or never.
In the 13–18 year‐old group, 12% drank sweet beverages daily, 51% a few times a week, and 32% rarely or never.
Across all students, 11% of all students had sweet drinks daily, 49% a few times a week, and 38% rarely or never.
For water consumption, 96% of 5–12 year olds and 93% of 13–18 year olds drank water daily.
In total, 96% of all students reported drinking water every day.
In terms of sweet snacks, 46% of 5–12 year olds and 38% of 13–18 year olds consumed them daily.
Additionally, 45% of the younger group and 50% of the older group had sweet snacks a few times a week.
Overall, 44% of all students ate sweet snacks daily, 47% a few times a week, and 7% rarely or never.
Regarding tooth brushing frequency, 1% of 5–12 year olds and 3% of 13–18 year olds reported rarely or never brushing their teeth.
A further 25% of younger students and 27% of older students brushed once a day, while 71% of the younger group and 49% of the older group brushed twice daily.
Additionally, 1% of younger students and 4% of older students brushed more than twice a day.
In total, 2% of all students rarely or never brushed, 26% brushed once a day, 69% brushed twice a day, and 2% brushed more than twice daily.
As for toothpaste types, 47% of younger students and 77% of older students used standard toothpaste.
In contrast, 45% of younger students and 5% of older students used children's toothpaste, while 3% of both age groups used non‐fluoridated toothpaste.
In line with the NSW Health Protocol for addressing childhood obesity, routine growth measurements were conducted during oral health assessments to enhance the identification and monitoring of health concerns.
Regarding body mass index (BMI), 7% of 5–12 year olds and 1% of 13–18 year olds were classified as below a healthy weight.
In contrast, 74% of younger students and 81% of older students were within a healthy weight range.
Eleven percent of both age groups were classified as above a healthy weight, and 9% of younger students and 7% of older students were categorized as well above a healthy weight.
Overall, 4% of all students were below a healthy weight, 77% had a healthy weight, 11% were above a healthy weight, and 8% were well above a healthy weight.
High dental decay risk was defined as the presence of either untreated dental carious lesions or a history of dental restorations due to past decay.
In this study, dental restorations were found in 18% of children (5–12 years old), 21% of adolescents (13–18 years old), and 20% of all students.
Dental decay affected 20% of children, 14% of adolescents, and 18% of all students.
The risk of dental caries, which includes existing restorations and untreated decay, was observed in 34% of children, 38% of adolescents, and 36% of the total sample.
Calculus deposits were observed in 17% of children, 14% of adolescents, and 16% of all participants, indicating potential risk factors for periodontal disease that warrant further attention.
Table2presents the results of the Chi‐Square analysis, examining the associations between key factors and oral health outcomes.
The presence of untreated dental caries and/or restorations is considered an indicator of dental caries risk, while the presence of calculus deposits is considered indicative of periodontal risk.
Chi‐Square analysis for factors associated with oral health indicators (age 5–18).
Note:This table presents an analysis of associations between various factors and oral health outcomes: untreated dental caries, dental restorations, dental calculus, and dental caries risk (untreated dental caries and dental restorations) among participants aged 5–18 years.
No significant associations were found between BMI or gender and dental caries, decay risk, or periodontal disease risk (p> 0.60).
A significant association was observed between a history of past dental problems and both untreated dental caries (χ2= 60.341,p< 0.001) and decay risk (χ2= 35.249,p< 0.001).
Children aged 5–12 years who had experienced dental issues in the past displayed a higher prevalence of these risks.
However, no significant relationship was found between a history of dental problems and periodontal disease risk (p= 0.278).
Recent dental visits were significantly associated with a lower dental caries risk (χ2= 13.099,p< 0.001).
A weak association was noted between recent dental visits and periodontal disease risk, although this was not statistically significant (p= 0.097).
The type of dental services attended (public, private, or specialist) did not show a significant relationship with oral disease risks (p> 0.30).
Neither fluoride application nor recent dental X‐rays were significantly associated with oral disease risks (p> 0.15).
Frequent consumption of sugar‐sweetened beverages was significantly associated with a higher dental decay risk (χ2= 5.941,p= 0.015) and showed a marginal association with periodontal disease risk (p= 0.060).
In contrast, the consumption of sweet snacks did not demonstrate significant associations with oral health outcomes (p> 0.060).
Tooth brushing frequency did not show a significant impact on oral disease risks (p> 0.30).
Toothpaste type exhibited a marginal association with decay risk (χ2= 3.233,p= 0.072), but no significant relationship was observed with other oral health outcomes.
Poor self‐rated oral health was strongly associated with higher decay risk (χ2= 20.289,p< 0.001) but showed no significant relationship with periodontal disease risk (p= 0.956).
Logistic regression analysis (Table3) identified several key factors that were significantly associated with oral health outcomes among children and adolescents aged 5–18 years, particularly in relation to dental caries risk (dental restorations, untreated dental caries) and periodontal disease risk (calculus).
Logistic regression results for predicting dental health outcomes (Age 5–18).
A history of dental problems was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of requiring restorations (OR = 3.493) and being categorized as high risk for developing dental caries (OR = 0.383), suggesting children with prior dental issues may be more prone to ongoing oral health problems.
Age and gender were also significantly associated with dental caries risk.
Older children (13–18 years) were three times more likely to develop dental caries compared to younger children aged 5–12 years (OR = 3.354).
Additionally, males were twice as likely as females to have untreated dental caries (OR = 2.019), suggesting potential gender‐related differences in oral health outcomes.
Dietary habits emerged as another important factor influencing dental caries risk.
Increased water intake was associated with a reduced risk of dental caries (OR = 0.825), suggesting a potential protective influence of water consumption on oral health.
Interestingly, frequent consumption of sweet snacks was unexpectedly linked to a lower likelihood of requiring restorations (OR = 0.536).
This result may be explained by factors such as improved oral hygiene practices or dietary guidance that helped mitigate the potential negative effects of sugar‐sweetened snacks.
Regarding periodontal disease risk, toothbrushing frequency was not significantly associated with the presence of calculus (p= 0.0309, OR = 1.372).
Additionally, limited variability in toothpaste types, given that 90% of the cohort used either standard or children's fluoride toothpaste, may have restricted the ability to detect meaningful differences in this variable.
This study addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable risk factors and associations that can inform preventive strategies for children and adolescents aged 5–18 years.
Although the sample was drawn from a limited number of schools participating in the WHIN program within a local health district in metropolitan Sydney, the findings offer valuable insights into oral disease risk in this population.
Importantly, there is a lack of recent studies using school‐based health assessment data to examine oral health in children and adolescents.
The results of this study highlight the potential to leverage real‐world data to inform proactive and context‐specific strategies for reducing oral disease risk.
The WHIN program, while not currently focused on oral health, emerged in this study as a possible platform for identifying at‐risk students through routine school health assessments.
At the same time, it is important to interpret these findings with caution, particularly those involving caregiver‐reported behaviors.
Several key variables, including dietary intake, oral hygiene practices, and self‐rated oral health, were based on caregiver self‐report.
These are subject to social desirability and recall biases, which may have led to over‐reporting of favorable behaviors, such as frequent tooth brushing or water consumption.
This potential reporting bias could partially explain unexpected or non‐significant associations observed in the data.
While such limitations are common in population‐based research (Sanzone et al.2013), acknowledging them is essential for the accurate interpretation of behavioral patterns.
Our findings highlight key factors contributing to poor oral health in this study cohort.
A history of dental issues, such as untreated dental caries and the need for dental restorations, was identified as a key risk factor for ongoing oral health problems in children.
Those with previous dental issues were more likely to require restorative care and faced an increased risk of developing future dental caries, aligning with existing research (Divaris2016; Zemaitiene et al.2016).
This highlights the critical need for early intervention to prevent the recurrence and progression of oral health problems, emphasizing the importance of addressing current issues promptly to avoid more serious complications in the future.
Age differences also emerged as a significant risk factor for dental caries risk.
Older children (13–18 years old) were found to be at a higher risk of developing dental caries compared to younger children (5–12 years old), which aligns with previous research (Hall‐Scullin et al.2017).
As children grow older, they are increasingly exposed to factors that elevate their dental caries risk, most notably, greater access to sugar‐sweetened snacks and beverages.
An Australian study by (Pettigrew et al.2015) found that exposure to television advertisements significantly increased children's demand for sweetened drinks.
In addition, older children tend to assume more responsibility for their oral hygiene routines, often with reduced parental supervision.
This increased independence may lead to inconsistent brushing habits, contributing to the risk of caries.
The combination of changes in dietary behaviors and oral care routines helps explain the heightened vulnerability to dental caries commonly observed in older age groups.
Moreover, males were found to be twice as likely as females to have untreated dental caries, suggesting potential behavioral differences between genders.
This disparity may be influenced by variations in oral hygiene routines or dietary habits, such as variations in brushing consistency, dietary choices, or differences in pain perception and help‐seeking behavior, which could influence these outcomes.
Including both dental restorations and untreated caries in the analysis allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of disease burden, capturing both current needs and historical vulnerability.
Although there is some overlap with caregiver‐reported dental history, analyzing these variables separately provided clearer insights into their distinct associations with oral disease.
This approach enhances interpretability and supports a more nuanced understanding of risk patterns in this cohort.
Sugary beverage consumption was consistently associated with increased caries risk in both bivariate (Chi‐Square) and multivariate (logistic regression) analyses, reinforcing the established link between sugar‐sweetened drinks and oral disease (Wang et al.2023).
Sweet snack consumption, while showing an inverse association with restorations in the Chi‐Square test, did not remain significant in logistic regression.
This suggests that the initial association may be confounded by other factors, such as oral hygiene habits, snack type, or consumption patterns.
Therefore, the role of sweet snacks in caries risk should be interpreted with caution.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased water intake was associated with reduced odds of dental caries (OR = 0.825), suggesting a potential protective influence on oral health.
Although water consumption was self‐reported and subject to bias, this finding supports established evidence on the benefits of water in maintaining oral health by rinsing food particles, diluting acids, and reducing demineralization, thereby lowering caries risk (Kim2021).
The analysis also confirmed that frequent sugar‐sweetened beverage consumption significantly increases the risk of dental caries, consistent with previous research.
In contrast, while sweet snack consumption was inversely associated with restorations in the Chi‐Square analysis, this relationship did not remain significant in the logistic regression model, suggesting confounding factors such as oral hygiene behaviors, snack type, or consumption patterns.
These findings highlight the importance of interpreting bivariate associations with caution, particularly when they do not persist in multivariable models.
Although a high percentage of children reported drinking water daily (96% in the younger group and 93% in the older group), reinforcing access to fluoridated tap water and reducing sugar‐sweetened beverage intake remain important.
These results highlight the value of logistic regression in distinguishing robust associations and underscore the role of water as a low‐cost, accessible caries‐prevention strategy.
The Chi‐Square analysis showed that more recent dental visits were associated with a lower risk of dental caries, indicating that timely dental care plays an important role in preventing the progression of oral disease.
The logistic regression results further emphasized this relationship, supporting the idea that regular dental check‐ups can reduce the likelihood of untreated caries and restorations.
This finding reinforces the importance of promoting routine dental visits as a fundamental component of caries prevention.
Ensuring that children have access to timely dental care is crucial for detecting dental problems early and preventing complications.
Parents/caregivers‐reported oral health was strongly correlated with higher decay risk, highlighting the relevance of individual perceptions in oral health outcomes.
Parents/caregivers who rated their children's oral health as poor were more likely to have untreated decay or existing restorations.
This finding suggests that self‐assessment may serve as a valuable tool for identifying individuals at risk of oral disease.
Promoting greater awareness among children and caregivers regarding their oral health status could facilitate earlier intervention and more effective management of dental issues.
An unexpected finding revealed that sweet snack consumption was associated with a lower likelihood of requiring restorations.
While this finding is intriguing, further investigation is needed to explore the potential reasons behind the inverse association.
One possible explanation is that children who frequently consume sweet snacks may also have better oral hygiene habits, such as brushing after meals, which can mitigate the harmful effects of sugar exposure.
Alternatively, children with a history of dental problems may have received dietary guidance or adopted improved behaviors, leading to reduced consumption of sugary snacks over time.
Another possibility is that the type of snacks consumed, their frequency, and oral clearance time play a role—evidence suggests (Bhola and Palta2020) that sticky or slowly dissolving sweets pose a higher risk than those consumed quickly with meals.
Despite this unexpected finding, the overall results reinforce the significance of dietary habits in oral health.
While the frequency of tooth brushing was found to be an important factor in oral health outcomes (Zimmermann et al.2015), logistic regression results showed that it did not significantly impact periodontal disease risk.
This aligns with the Chi‐Square analysis, which also showed no significant association between brushing frequency and oral disease risk.
However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of brushing is influenced not only by frequency but also by technique, duration, and brushing pressure (Baruah et al.2017).
Factors that were not measured in this study.
Therefore, while tooth brushing is essential for maintaining oral health, the quality of brushing may be a more critical factor than simply how often children brush their teeth.
Additionally, parental supervision is crucial for ensuring effective brushing, particularly in younger children.
Evidence has shown that supervised toothbrushing leads to better plaque control and reduced caries risk (Hilgert et al.2017).
As children become more independent, reduced parental oversight may contribute to poorer brushing quality, which could explain why brushing frequency alone did not significantly impact periodontal disease risk.
The type of toothpaste used is generally considered a protective factor in maintaining oral health, primarily due to the benefits of fluoride in preventing dental decay and supporting periodontal health (Walsh et al.2019).
Despite the high usage of standard fluoride toothpaste (77% of older students and 47% of younger students), toothpaste type was not found to be a significant periodontal disease‐associated risk factor in the logistic regression analysis.
This aligns with the Chi‐Square results, which revealed only a marginal association between toothpaste type and decay risk.
The lack of significant findings may be due to the limited variety of toothpaste choices, as it is less likely that a clear distinction in oral health outcomes could be observed based on toothpaste type alone.
Additionally, this finding suggests that other oral hygiene factors, such as brushing technique, frequency, and duration, may have a greater influence on periodontal health than the specific type of toothpaste used.
The limited variation in toothpaste types (with 90% of the cohort using either standard or children's toothpaste) likely restricted the ability to detect meaningful differences in this variable.
This suggests that the type of toothpaste may have less influence on periodontal disease risk compared to other factors such as brushing technique and consistency.
This study highlights that despite the availability of national and state‐level oral health programs, such as the CDBS and MDOP, many high‐risk children continue to fall through the gaps and remain undetected.
Undiagnosed and untreated dental issues can negatively impact their school attendance and academic performance, reinforcing the need for early identification and coordinated support.
Building on these findings, there is a compelling rationale for integrating oral health into existing school wellbeing structures, such as the WHIN program.
Although the WHIN does not currently include an oral health focus, it presents a strategic platform to embed preventive oral health initiatives within routine school health assessments.
For example, incorporating a few targeted oral health screening questions into WHIN assessments could help identify children at risk of oral disease, who may otherwise be overlooked by existing dental programs.
While this recommendation is not derived from intervention data, it is grounded in observed service gaps and is intended to guide future service design and planning.
The nurse‐led, real‐time identification approach offers a practical and scalable way to support early intervention and referrals, especially for families facing barriers to accessing dental care.
Strengthening links between school nurses, families, and dental services can help address inequities in oral health care and ensure support reaches those who need it most.
By leveraging real‐world data collected through school‐based programs, health services can adopt a more proactive and context‐specific approach to reducing oral disease risk and promoting healthy equity.
This study has several limitations.
As noted in the discussion, caregiver‐reported data on behaviors such as diet and oral hygiene may be influenced by social desirability bias and recall biases.
The reporting inaccuracies may affect the robustness of the associations identified between variables and oral health outcomes.
While these limitations are common in population‐based studies and questionnaires, caution should be applied when interpreting results related to self‐reported behaviors.
The limited representation of certain subgroups, such as Indigenous children and those with medical conditions, restricted subgroup analyses and reduced the applicability of the findings to these populations.
The cross‐sectional design restricts the ability to draw causal inferences, highlighting the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate temporal relationships between risk factors and oral health outcomes.
Additionally, while school‐based assessments provided valuable clinical data, the reliance on visual inspections without radiographic confirmation may have underestimated the prevalence of certain conditions, such as interproximal (between‐teeth) dental decay.
Finally, the study's geographic focus on metropolitan Sydney, though diverse, limits the generalizability of findings to rural or remote populations.
The exclusion of non‐mainstream school students, such as those in special education settings, also narrows the scope of the study and may overlook insights from groups at higher risk of oral health problems.
This study identified key risk and protective factors for oral disease among children aged 5–18, including age, gender, dental history, dietary habits, and water intake.
These findings highlight the importance of early intervention, routine dental care, and health‐promotion behaviors.
Despite national programs, some at‐risk children remain underserved.
Integrating oral health into broader school‐based initiatives, like the WHIN program, could support early identification and referral.
Strengthening links between schools, families, and oral health services may enhance access and reduce inequities.
Future research could explore the outcomes of such integrated models in improving oral health among disadvantaged populations.
Based on the findings of this study, school‐based well‐being programs like WHIN can partner with local oral health services to adopt a health‐promotion approach that strengthens oral health awareness and support across individuals, families, and school communities.
Future research should explore effective models for integrating oral health into school programs, focusing on feasibility, implementation, and sustainability.
