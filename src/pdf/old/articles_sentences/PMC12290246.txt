Since the Late Pleistocene, humans and dogs have coevolved in the Arctic, forming a symbiotic relationship essential to survival, mobility, and adaptation.
Archeological evidence shows dogs were used as traction animals by the Early Holocene, ultimately facilitating Inuit expansion and shaping Arctic settlement patterns.
Despite recent declines in sled dog populations due to colonial factors, climate change, and cultural shifts, dogs remain central to Inuit identity.
This paper frames the human‐dog cooperation as a dynamic system of mutual learning, orenskilment, where both species acquire shared skills through collaboration.
Tools like harnesses and whips serve as communicative devices within this system.
Drawing on archeological and contemporary Inuit practices, the study highlights how embodied knowledge and animal agency contribute to ecological resilience.
By viewing the Arctic as a co‐managed landscape shaped by human‐dog cooperation, the paper challenges static views of adaptation and underscores the enduring significance of this interspecies relationship.
Since the Late Pleistocene, dogs and humans have evolved together in the Arctic [1].
In this codependent relationship, dogs have assisted Indigenous communities in hunting and enabled important historical events such as the Inuit expansion across the North American Arctic about 800 years ago [2].
Archeological evidence suggests that the use of dogs as traction animals emerged in Siberia during the Early Holocene, as fragments of wooden sled parts and dog remains were discovered at the 9000‐year‐old Zhokhov site in the New Siberian Islands [3,4].
Across the Arctic, dogs were traditionally used as a primary mode of transportation [5,6], providing key advantages such as larger hunting areas, the ability to transport heavy cargo, and the capability to expand into new territories.
Without dogs, some areas in the Arctic may have been inaccessible.
Despite their significance, the populations of dogs traditionally used for dog sledding have declined in recent centuries across the Arctic.
Diminishing dog populations in the Arctic have been the result of distinct factors in each area of the region.
Even in Greenland, where reliance on dog sledding has been continuous for at least 800 years, the population of the Greenlandic sled dog,Qimmeq, has declined from about 25,000 individuals in 2002 to approximately 15,000 individuals in 2016 and continues to decrease [7].
There are several reasons for this decline, including the disappearance of sea ice, which is melting due to global warming, and the warming of currents along the Greenlandic coasts, as well as cultural transitions away from subsistence hunting of marine mammals.
In Canada, the population of dogs was reduced from tens of thousands to only a few hundred dogs in the twentieth century.
This was in large part as a result of the systematic eradication of the dogs was undertaken by the Canadian Royal Mounted Police [8,9,10].
In Siberian regions such as Kamchatka, the onset of World War II and the introduction of reindeer and later mechanized transport led to a reduction in the number of dogs in the early twentieth century [11,12].
Across the Arctic, the twentieth century bore witness to a turning point in dog populations.
This paper advances the view that the human‐dog cooperation in Arctic contexts is best understood through the lens of dynamic systems theory.
This approach draws attention to relationships that are not static or unidirectional, unfolding through reciprocal interactions over time [13,14].
A key concept in dynamic systems theory is emergence, defined as properties or capacities that are not inherent in any single part of a system, but arise only through the interaction of its components ([15]; Thompson 2007).
For example, the shared perception and responsiveness that guides the movement of a hunter and sled team as they navigate an icescape can be understood as an emergent phenomenon.
Applying a dynamic systems perspective highlights how human and dog behaviors, skills, and ecological agency co‐adapt and respond to shifting environmental and cultural conditions at many scales.
This frames the relations as something more than domestication, where humans and dogs form a symbiotic system capable of generating creative, resilient, and transformative responses to environmental challenges.
By examining this system across evolutionary, archeological, and contemporary Inuit traditions—where dogs remain integral to cultural identity and perceptions of the future—we reveal how this relationship produces unique ecological properties: an extended environmental memory, the ability to navigate thresholds of change, and a shared intelligence that reshapes both community and landscape.
In this view, the Arctic emerges not as a static wilderness, but as a managed, living system shaped through long histories of dynamic cooperation between humans, dogs, and their environments.
First, we examine evidence for how these practices and the meaning of working with dogs have evolved over time, focusing on the cooperation and learning that define relationships between humans and dogs, both in the past and present.
Second, we discuss the coevolution of humans and dogs in the Arctic context and examine the role of dogs in facilitating human movement and adaptation in extreme environments through archeological evidence.
To understand the symbiotic human‐dog systems, we explore how people use dogs today and how enskilment continues to play a role in working and training together.
Information and knowledge from handlers who use and train dogs for traction, hunting, tourism, or as a hobby provide valuable insights into human‐dog interactions.
While these traditions and practices evolve over time and thus cannot be directly applied to uncover past cultural contexts, they provide a framework for understanding the different interactions that may have shaped historical dog training and use, as well as how animal agency and behavior are interlinked within relationships [16].
To explore the development of human‐dog interactions, this study has used a multidisciplinary mixed‐method approach.
This involved both the observation of dog handlers and active engagement with their activities.
The quantitative and qualitative parts of the study consisted of a survey conducted in the spring of 2024 with three open questions and three closed questions administered to dog handlers and mushers to assess the dog sledding practice and the continuous reproduction of skills between generations, together with the perceptions of dogs in relation to the environment.
Furthermore, the qualitative portion consisted of ethnographic interviews conducted in the 1950s to explore how they have coevolved and understand how the relationship is entangled within the landscape.
By comparing traditional knowledge of the modern dog sled practice with the information of the practice obtained through the ethnographic survey conducted by the National Museum of Denmark in the 1950s, this study will lead to a wider understanding of the long‐term changes and continuities in dog sledding and offers new insights into the details of past dog sledding practices and domestication of sled dogs.
The human‐dog cooperation is a dynamic system of mutual learning, orenskilment, where both species acquire shared skills through collaboration.
The ongoing effort of dog domestication, in this case sled dogs, involves enskilment from both parties, which is an important part of the collaboration between humans and dogs.
Learning a skill or becoming enskilled is a critical element of the domestication process that is categorized by recurrently engaging in a task and evolves over the long term.
Dogs have been essential for many Northern societies, and the role of dogs in the Arctic communities is extremely varied [17], ranging from hunting and herding to providing traction [2,18,19,20].
Dogs also served as food sources, sacrificial victims, and are described in cosmology and myths [18,21].
The dogs served multiple roles, not only during their lifetime but post‐mortem as well.
In North American and Siberian archeological sites, dog remains with signs of butchery have been discovered [19].
For example, at the site of Ust'‐Polui, Siberia, many of the recovered dog bones contained cut marks, indicating butchery for consumption ([19] b).
They served other post‐mortem purposes, including as raw materials for garments.
Dogs are equipped with a well‐insulated fur with three layers, consisting of inner down hair, intermediate awn hair, and the outer guard hair.
Their thick fur enabled them to survive across the Arctic, which humans exploited for protection from the climatic elements [22].
In Inuit cosmology, the dog often played an important role either in the beginning of human life, as ancestors, or in the end to take care of the human remains.
Despite Inuit cosmology considering all animals to have a soul, the dog was the only animal that was given a name and regarded as a part of the family [18].
The highlighted utilitarian functions and the occurrence of dogs in past and present art emphasize their substantial role in human life ([18,23], 111).
Within a multispecies perspective where humans are decentered and the role of nonhuman animals is elevated, objects are often implicated, as a mediator between humans and animals [24].
McNiven [25] describes the role of the canoe, which can be seen as an agent mediating the hunting relations between marine prey and humans.
Other technological objects or skills, including tools or navigation, are intertwined parts of Northern peoples' relations with working animals [26].
In Northern environments, domestication often occurs in landscapes where humans and animals co‐exist.
The entanglement of animals, land, things, and humans is an important factor to consider in understanding domestication, where the landscape ties the species together [27].
Another example is the herding of Arctic reindeer, which has been discussed as ‘symbiotic domesticity’, referring to the interaction between humans and reindeer [28,29].
In this ecological engagement, where humans and reindeer collaborate, the relationships are performed and housed in the landscape.
Within this ecological approach, the activity of animals is entangled with the economic and social objectives of humans [27].
While dogs are considered to be the first animal to have been domesticated by humans, this should be considered an ongoing process in which both humans and animals are adapting.
Therefore, it is important to investigate the evolution between these two species, in which both humans and animals are adapting in response to each other from social and biological perspectives.
Following their domestication in the Late Pleistocene in Eurasia, dogs have accompanied humans to all corners of the world [1,2,30,31,32].
The presence of dogs on archeological sites in the Americas, such as the Koster site in present‐day Illinois, establishes the introduction of dogs to the mid‐continent at least 10,000 years ago (Perri et al. 2019 [31]).
Molecular dating of the divergence of different dog lineages using ancient DNA has shed light on the time of migrations that coincide with parallel divergences and migrations in humans [1,2,31].
While the societal position of dogs in these cultures remains largely unknown, these studies revealed that dogs in northeastern Siberia and North America were migrating alongside humans.
Associated with these collaborative migrations of humans and dogs has been the adaptation of both parties to the local environments in the newly settled regions.
The reliance of dogs on humans for the provisioning of resources has resulted in biological adaptations of dogs to the diets relative to the cultural conditions.
The most poignant example of this may be the proliferation of the number of copies of the AMYB2 gene, increasing the dogs' abilities to digest starch, in the Neolithic following the agricultural transition [32,33,34].
Localized adaptation has also been observed in dogs originating from high‐altitude regions, such as the Tibetan Mastiff on the Tibetan Plateau, where dogs have adapted to low oxygen or hypoxic conditions through acquiring advantageous EPAS1 alleles from local wolves [35,36].
The symbiotic human‐dog systems in the Arctic for thousands of years have benefited from the adaptation of dogs in the region to the environment through pathways associated with temperature and pain sensitivity, in addition to the management of exercise‐induced hypoxia [37].
Furthermore, the shared reliance on diets rich in fats and limited in starch for humans and dogs mirrors one another [37].
The interplay between humans and dogs not only alters the interactions between the two and the role dogs occupy in society but also the adaptation to both the environment and the culture in which they reside.
The symbiotic cooperation between humans and dogs was essential for hunter‐gatherer societies and influenced other human‐animal interactions [38].
The symbiotic human‐dog bond is even evident through ethno‐linguistic examples, such as the Inuit expressionqimuksiit.
The term,qimuksiit, refers to the act of dog sledding, where humans and dogs are collaborating to become one unit to execute the practice [39].
The Inuit relied on their dogs for survival, but dogs also depended on humans to live, as they were not able to compete with wolves.
However, the power dynamic between humans and dogs is unequal, as humans control and direct the dog's actions.
In return for performing tasks like pulling sleds, humans provide care and sustenance to the dogs ([40], 64).
Furthermore, in some of the indigenous cosmoecologies, all individuals are indebted to shared ancestors, who have passed on the gift of life, and to the creatures they live alongside, whether as hunters or prey.
These relationships are symbiotic, with each part depending on the other.
Within these accounts, the bonds between humans and dogs formed early in life help people understand these interconnections and shared responsibilities among all living creatures.
This understanding is further supported by the stories and teachings passed down from the elders [41].
Human‐dog cooperation, it has been argued, can be best understood as an adaptive, cybernetic linkage—a dynamic, symbiotic system that bridges species, environment, and culture [42,43,44].
This is especially poignant in the context of the Arctic [45].
While traditional interpretations of domestication often frame animals in unidirectional terms, subsumed as tools within human systems, these perspectives rely heavily on models that emphasize economic drivers of coevolution [46].
Such approaches have been noted to overlook social and emotional aspects of the relationship [19], or that they also miss the emergent properties of this relationship—outcomes that cannot be reduced to the actions or traits of either species individually [42,47].
Instead, this symbiosis is better captured through the lens of complex dynamic systems, where mutual adaptation and cooperation give rise to novel capacities.
In this context, emergence refers to the creation of new, system‐level properties that arise from dog‐human interactions (see [48,49]).
For example, activities like sledding and hunting integrate dogs' physical abilities—such as speed, tracking, and cold resistance—with humans' planning, tool use, and social organization (Figure1).
Together, they generate efficiencies and outcomes that neither species could achieve independently.
Over time, shared behaviors, communication cues, and even biological traits evolve in tandem, producing a complex system greater than the sum of its parts—one that is uniquely suited to Arctic environments.
Human‐Dog symbiotic systems in the Arctic.
A sled dog at the center represents its key role in Arctic survival.
Surrounding elements illustrate interactions with predators (polar bear), detecting seal breathing holes, traditional transportation (dog sled and hunter), food sources (fish, seal), and tracking behavior (paw prints).
The dog‐human symbiotic system we envision is not static but inherently dynamic and generative.
Together, humans and dogs can be understood to form an extended sensory‐cognitive entity—a system that not only responds to but actively reshapes the Arctic environment.
This emergent partnership enables Arctic peoples to perceive, interpret, and act upon environmental complexities in ways that are both creative and fundamentally new.
The result is a form of joint sentience, immanent within the system, where cognitive and sensory capacities are distributed across species [43,50,51].
Adaptability is the key to the ability to step outside rigidity and path dependence, allowing communities to respond fluidly to shifting conditions.
Dogs appear to be at the core of such broad‐spectrum lifeways1, facilitating transitions between stable states of coherence.
By enabling movement across ecological subsystems—whether tundra, ice, or marine environments—dogs help communities quickly reorganize and establish new modes of stability in the face of environmental flux.
Dogs possess acute sensory capabilities that allow them to detect environmental cues often imperceptible to humans.
The importance of these in Arctic lifeways is well documented in ethnographic depictions of Arctic communities and continued lifeways [45,54,55].
For example, dogs' sense of smell enables them to locate seal breathing holes beneath the ice—critical for successful hunts—while their sensitivity to subtle vibrations and sounds allows them to guide humans safely across unstable icescapes that provide access to hunting grounds.
Dogs also respond to subtle environmental cues, such as shifts and wind direction, which can signal changing weather, and their instincts and heightened awareness alert humans to nearby predators, such as polar bears, well before humans perceive the danger (Figure1).
These sensory abilities significantly extend the perceptual reach of Arctic communities.
Humans, in turn, interpret and integrate these signals into their cultural and ecological knowledge systems, creating a distributed awareness that allows the Arctic landscape to be decoded and acted upon with remarkable precision.
This shared sensory‐cognitive system transforms environmental complexities into actionable knowledge and has remained an important feature of Arctic lifeways through the colonial period and into contemporary hunting.
The dog‐human system in Arctic environments functions as a network, characterized by expanded sensory feedback that allows the symbiotic system to perceive, respond to, and adjust to change.
As sensors and actors, detecting subtle environmental cues, dogs collaborate with humans who serve as interpreters and decision‐makers, transforming these signals into coordinated responses.
These are manifest in typical annual choices, such as where to move, when to aggregate, how to plan caches, which species migrations to intercept, etc. This dynamic exchange creates a self‐regulating system capable of anticipating necessary transformations, such as adjusting hunting strategies or navigating unstable landscapes.
Dogs' significant agency within these feedback loops enables unique opportunities for adaptation: they enhance human mobility through sledding, granting access to diverse ecological zones—from tundra to coastal ice—thereby increasing resilience in resource acquisition [45].
Furthermore, as we develop below, dogs' shorter lifespans facilitate generational knowledge transfer through cycles of training and learning, ensuring that adaptive behaviors are continuously refined across both human and canine generations.
This iterative process fosters behavioral resilience, allowing Arctic communities to respond flexibly to seasonal variability, ecological disruptions, or shifting prey availability.
Together, dogs and humans form a responsive, cybernetic system that not only survives but thrives in dynamic and unpredictable Arctic environments, where the capacity to anticipate and adapt is crucial.
A critical observation for understanding the human‐dog symbiotic system is that while dogs are not absolutely necessary to Arctic lifeways—evidenced by rare archeological examples of communities that apparently lived without them—their presence is consistently associated with broad‐spectrum hunting and gathering strategies.
These strategies involve the capacity to exploit multiple marine and terrestrial systems and are often coupled with dramatic mobility, adaptability, and resistance to rigidity in seasonal behavior.
Viewed through the lens of system dynamics and emergence, the archeology of arctic dogs reveals their importance in exploration, migration, and community transformation at pivotal moments in Arctic (pre)history.
Thus, dogs may act as catalysts for change and amplify human capacity to respond to ecological and cultural challenges.
In the early migrations associated with the Paleo‐Inuit cultural complex, dogs likely played a critical role in enabling humans to first settle the High Arctic, a region characterized by extreme environmental conditions, isolation, and limited accessibility.
Although dogs are represented in the few strong zooarchaeological assemblages from this period, by extending human sensory perception and hunting efficiency, dogs could have facilitated survival in previously inaccessible landscapes [56,57,58].
We speculate that their role in mobility and resource acquisition allowed humans to operate flexibly across ecological subsystems, moving between terrestrial and marine environments to secure resources and establish footholds across vast territories.
In contrast, during the Late Paleo‐Inuit (Dorset) phase, sometimes referred to as Tuniit, we see an assumed absence of dogs.
Tuniit communities appear to have relied on narrower subsistence strategies, highly specialized in seal hunting at the ice edge and polynya environments (Figure1).
Without the adaptive breadth and mobility provided by the dog‐human system, Tuniit lifeways appear to have been more rigid and ecologically constrained, and so dogs may enable broad‐spectrum strategies and enhance resilience in unpredictable Arctic conditions.
The Thule or ancestral Inuit period marks a reintroduction of sled dogs, traced originally to Siberia, though the Bering Strait region to the Central and Eastern Arctic, corresponding with a suite of associated technologies represented in artifact assemblages [58].
Although there has been debate about the speed of the Thule Inuit migration through the North American Arctic [59], there is little doubt that together the dog sled, kayaks, and umiaks facilitated this process [60].
Sled dogs clearly enabled long‐distance travel across expansive Arctic regions, connecting communities across vast distances and facilitating the exploitation of diverse marine resources.
Dogs remained central during the colonial and historical periods, as Arctic communities navigated the pressures of trade, colonial contact, and integration into global systems.
Even colonial exploration of the Arctic relied upon the expertise of the Inuit and dogs for transportation, becoming instrumental in this frontier.
Across these historical thresholds, the presence (or absence) of dogs highlights their role as active participants in Arctic systems of exploration and adaptation.
This persists into the present, as we demonstrate below, in conversation with community members who keep and use dogs in the present.
While Arctic communities without dogs relied on narrower ecological specializations, the human‐dog symbiotic system enabled broad‐spectrum lifeways characterized by ecological diversity, dynamic mobility, and resilience.
In this deep historical view, the dog‐human symbiotic system can be seen to foster a form of shared ecological intelligence that is perhaps unique to arctic lifeways—a sort of distributed sentience defined by emergent ability for the system to perceive, respond to, and creatively adapt to environmental unpredictability.
We hypothesize that this system operates with a remarkable transformability: it can rapidly establish new states of coherence while maintaining the capacity to dissolve them when conditions demand.
In the Arctic, where environments are marked by extreme sensitivity and cascading ecological consequences to small perturbations that can radically affect animal movement or the formation of key resources.
For example, this flexibility is critical in areas such as polynyas, areas of open water within sea ice, that are frequently centers of marine activity for feeding and breeding of many species.
From an archeological perspective, communities with dogs exhibit a broad‐spectrum adaptability.
Dogs enable access to multiple ecological zones, which act as a buffer, insulating communities from resource instability and ensuring their capacity to shift strategies when necessary.
What makes this system remarkable is its capacity to navigate thresholds of transformation.
Arctic conditions impose significant risks of becoming locked into rigid patterns of behavior—a form of path dependence that can undermine resilience.
While building temporary states of coherence remains essential for survival, the Arctic demands the ability to release these lifeways and adapt quickly to shifting conditions [54].
The dog‐human system bridges these critical thresholds by facilitating mobility and responsiveness, allowing communities to reorganize dynamically in pursuit of new stability.
This creative intelligence here is not merely reactive but profoundly generative: it enables humans and dogs to reconfigure their relationships with the landscape, form new pathways, reshape resource availability, and cultivate novel ecological connections.
In this way, the symbiotic system fosters continuous transformation, equipping Arctic peoples with the flexibility to thrive amid impermanence and environmental flux.
In the relationship between arctic animals and people, material culture and environmentally situated practice are often an important feature of emergent systems [61].
The skillset within the sled dog domestication is mutual, where the dogs become skilled as well in understanding verbal and non‐verbal communication, procedures, and gestures.
This mutual enskilment takes place in a broader context, which often involves landscapes and made objects.
For example, the communication between the dogs and the musher often involves whips, harnesses, and buckles, and not only verbal or non‐verbal actions.
Furthermore, these specific items have been continuously refined for this purpose.
Without engagement in the activity with the use of these specific things, knowledge of the practice will not evolve.
Therefore, the enskilment has to be mutual and not only rely on the animal, but instead be developed jointly through cooperation and practice [62].
Instruments such as dog whips and harnesses can be interpreted as tools of communication that enable humans and dogs to be aware of each other (Figure1).
However, these instruments define a setting where dogs and humans collaborate and serve as social infrastructures.
If these are only regarded as tools of commandment from the human master, they cannot facilitate communication in a shared landscape of co‐residence.
While training a young dog to harness mainly concerns the human‐dog relationship, it also requires inter‐dog pedagogics [27].
Inexperienced and younger dogs learn the practices through engagement with more experienced dogs and repeating the procedure of being harnessed and pulling the sled.
Several aspects are thus necessary in the process of becoming a transportation animal, such as the environment, the landscape, and the knowledge of more experienced mushers and dogs.
As a result of climate change and industrialization, among other factors, there has been a significant decrease in the sled dog population.
However, the sled dogs play a symbolic and vital role in cultural maintenance and recuperation.
The transmission between generations of an ongoing embodied knowledge and practice‐based awareness has also been affected by the changes in society, yet remains important to Inuit communities and their perceptions of the future [45,63].
Oral stories of the elders and observations are therefore important in these ecologically challenging times, to ensure that younger generations learn about the entangled relation and history between Inuit and dogs that have always existed together [41].
For a better understanding of the various human‐dog interactions, a questionnaire was developed to assess the dog sledding practice and the continuous reproduction of skills between generations, together with the perceptions of dogs in relation to the environment.
The questionnaire included two main topics: transmission of knowledge and knowledge dependent on dogs.
The survey was conducted in the spring of 2024 and distributed to dog handlers concerning their experiences of dog sledding in Greenland.
Recruitment was conducted on a voluntary basis using social media and during community events.
The data were examined through thematic content analysis (Neuendorf 2016) to explore characteristics of the responses and gain a better understanding of their remarks.
There were a total of 37 people who participated in the survey.
Men represented 49% (n= 18) and women 51% (n= 19).
Among the participants in the survey, 51% (n= 19) were based in Sisimiut, West Greenland (Figure2).
Map showing the distribution of survey respondents (n= 37) regarding their experiences with dog sledding in Greenland.
The respondents were geographically distributed as follows: Sisimiut (n= 19), Tasiilaq (n= 6), Ilulissat (n= 4), Qeqertarsuaq (n= 3), and one participant each from Aasiaat, Uummannaq, Qasigiannguit, Kangaatsiaq, and Qaanaaq.
The ice sheet is marked with blue lines.
There appears to be a shift in the practice of using dogs compared to the mid‐twentieth century.
In the 1950s, dogs were mainly used for traction and hunting, whereas today, dogs are also used for tourism or kept as a hobby (NES2).
When answering the question regarding why they kept sled dogs, the respondents mentioned that they gave them: “connection to nature” and a “sense of community”.
Some mentioned that they had learned a lot about the environment, and it gave a different perspective on how you perceive and experience the landscape.
A respondent replied that “when going out in nature, the dogs and the handler help each other, so that if the ice is unstable, the dogs will ‘inform’ the handler.
Snowmobiles can't do that.
This also applies if another animal is nearby, then the dogs will warn you”.
In total, 62% (n= 23) directly mentioned the word “nature” and considered dog sledding to be the connection between humans and nature.
In relation to bridging a connection to nature, many said that having dogs gave them a sense of freedom and enabled them to visit different destinations, which shows that dogs are still considered an important means of transportation.
One of the respondents said that having dogs was also a way of learning about the Greenlandic culture and how dogs are kept and used, and have been used traditionally.
Others also said that it was a way of protecting and passing on their cultural heritage, and they were happy to be able to be a part of the culture.
When the respondents were asked about what they had learned by having dogs, some mentioned that it had given them a sense of responsibility that could also be used in other aspects of life.
Most of the respondents said that besides teaching them about responsibility, the dogs had taught them about collaboration and humility, since dog sledding requires working together as a team.
One of the mushers emphasized that the dogs had given him perspective, which could also be applied to other aspects of life,“The responsibility you have by keeping dogs gives you a lot when you are a young man, it gives you a perspective that you can use for the rest of your life”.
Regarding the elements of learning and training, most respondents stated that the practice was family‐taught, including the traditional skill of using the dog whip for steering.
Some of these mushers described that they grew up in families that had always kept dogs, and it was a part of their family tradition.
They explained that they started learning from a young age by participating and observing.
Through different generations, the knowledge of communication between dogs and humans has been passed down.
Transmission of traditional expertise and knowledge has been ongoing and continuously renewed in Greenlandic dog sledding, which has made adaptations to changes in the practice possible.
There are some similarities between current practices for training and those of the mid‐twentieth century: the training to become a sled dog still usually starts when the puppies are around 6 months old, where they are included in the team in pairs or individually, and the methods are very similar (NES2).
Both in our survey and within ethnographic descriptions, the mushers highlighted that training has to be based on cooperation and trust.
Communication between the mushers and dogs occurs in various ways.
Most of the handlers explained that it was significant to speak calmly and relax with the dogs, since dogs are highly perceptive animals, often reflecting the emotional states of their handlers.
The dogs need to learn different commands or signals that are used by the handler to steer them.
However, these commands can vary from musher to musher.
The dog whip is one of the primary means of communication between the handler and the sled dogs (Figure1) and has been used since the Thule period (1200 CE) [55,64].
Some use the whip more frequently and hard‐handedly than others.
Commands for directing the dogs when driving are rarely shouted, but can be said very quietly to well‐trained and disciplined dog teams.
To start the dogs, the musher usually cracks the whip or pulls the upstanders slightly backwards.
For steering the team to the right or left, the handler will typically crack the dog whip in the snow on the opposite side of the team.
To stop the sled dogs, the command ‘uniit’ or ‘ai’ is used on the West Coast.
The sled drivers usually try to keep their commands and signals a secret, and rarely discuss with other mushers or non‐dog sled drivers [65].
When asked about how the use of dogs and the sled tradition has evolved, many claimed that there had been significant shifts in tradition and technique over time.
Some responses also stated that the fear of losing the tradition was one of the reasons why they kept dogs, especially because dog sledding has a great personal and cultural significance.
The dog handlers reported that training is less rough than previously, where punishment of the dogs was more frequent.
Today, there is a greater emphasis placed on communication and collaboration between humans and dogs.
This is clearly reflected in the interviews, which highlight the development in the approach of the sled dog training methods: “People have (fortunately) become wiser about the psychology of dogs in my generation.
Therefore, you are not as strict with the dogs as you have been in the past”.
This statement reflects a broader trend towards a more gentle approach to training, which not only improves the well‐being of the dogs but also improves the collaboration between the musher and the dogs.
The dog‐human relationship in the Arctic represents a complex, emergent system that is more than a process of domestication.
By challenging static views of adaptation, this symbiotic system reveals that survival in the Arctic is rooted in dynamic cooperation and creative intelligence.
Importantly, the dog‐human symbiotic system contributes to niche construction—the active shaping and stewardship of Arctic environments over generations.
Dogs and humans together: (1) facilitate human presence and mobility across vast, harsh landscapes, enabling access to otherwise inaccessible ecological zones; (2) influence species distributions and prey populations through selective stewardship, where patterns of hunting and movement shape ecological relationships; and (3) embed ecological knowledge within cultural memory, fostering a long‐term continuity of adaptive environmental relationships.
Recognizing the human‐dog symbiotic systems in this context underscores the Arctic as a living legacy of interaction, long managed and shaped by Inuit communities through enduring patterns of environmental stewardship.
The presence of this symbiotic system raises important questions about agency in ecological processes and the ways histories of interaction fundamentally shape ecological systems.
By understanding the Arctic not as a static wilderness but as a co‐constructed and dynamic landscape, the role of the dog‐human system emerges as a powerful force in shaping both past and contemporary possibilities for survival, adaptation, and innovation.
