The aims of this study were to examine the relationships between authentic leadership, missed nursing care, and intention to leave in hospital nurses and to investigate the mediating role of psychological safety in these relationships.
Nursing managers' authentic leadership and unit psychological safety influence nursing practice and work attitudes.
However, the relationships among authentic leadership, psychological safety, missed nursing care, and turnover intention remain underexplored, highlighting the need for further investigation.
This cross‐sectional descriptive study analyzed online survey data collected from 504 registered nurses in the United States between April 2021 and July 2022.
Multiple linear and logistic regression models, along with Hayes' PROCESS macro, were used for data analysis.
Nurses who perceived their unit managers as exhibiting greater authentic leadership reported fewer missed nursing care tasks and were less likely to intend to leave.
Psychological safety mediated these relationships, as authentic leadership was positively associated with psychological safety.
In turn, psychological safety was associated with reduced levels of missed nursing care and decreased turnover intention among hospital staff nurses.
Organizational initiatives to enhance nurse managers’ authentic leadership through targeted training, resource support, and relevant policies are essential for improving psychological safety, patient care quality, and nurses' job outcomes.
These findings emphasise the need for organisational investment in authentic leadership development to promote safer, more supportive care environments and improve outcomes for both nurses and patients.
Healthcare systems worldwide are facing numerous challenges, including budget constraints, nursing shortages, and economic pressures (Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development [OECD]2024; World Health Organization [WHO]2024).
These issues have profoundly affected nursing practice and the broader profession (OECD2024; WHO2024), often resulting in delays, omissions, or rationing of essential nursing care (Labrague et al.2022; Scott et al.2019).
Such care gaps not only compromise patient outcomes but also place significant stress on nursing staff (Janatolmakan and Khatony2022), underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of their causes and potential solutions.
Missed nursing care, often referred to as “unfinished care” or “care left undone,” is defined as “any aspect of required patient care that is omitted (either in part or in whole) or delayed” due to constraints such as insufficient staffing, time pressures, or inadequate resources (Kalisch et al.2009, p. 1509).
This issue has emerged as a critical indicator of care quality in healthcare systems and has been linked to adverse outcomes, including decreased patient satisfaction, increased medication errors, and preventable complications such as infections, falls, and pressure ulcers (Kalánková et al.2020).
Addressing missed nursing care is critical not only for improving patient safety but also for supporting the nursing workforce and maintaining organizational stability (Kalánková et al.2020; Janatolmakan and Khatony2022).
Nurses’ ability to deliver quality care is influenced by the context in which they work, which includes both physical and psychological factors.
While staffing levels and resource availability are essential, the psychological environment also plays an important role.
Previous studies have shown that stronger teamwork and effective communication among nurses within the unit can be key factors in preventing missed care (Kalisch et al.2009; Chaboyer et al.2021).
Another promising avenue for reducing missed nursing care is fostering psychological safety within nursing units.
Psychological safety, as defined by Edmondson (2018, p. 16), is “a workplace climate where individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves, sharing concerns, and admitting mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution.” In such an environment, employees feel empowered to voice their concerns about care processes, propose new solutions, and work collaboratively to address challenges (Edmondson2018), potentially reducing missed care.
Psychological safety not only can impact missed nursing care but also affect broader organizational outcomes, such as nurse retention.
High turnover rates among nurses, exacerbated by workforce shortages, continue to strain healthcare systems (Ren et al.2024).
Fostering psychological safety within nursing units may be a modifiable factor in reducing turnover intention, making it an essential focus for healthcare organizations seeking to support both their staff and patients.
Leadership is integral to fostering team psychological safety, which is essential for improving employee performance and enhancing work experiences (Newman et al.2017).
Among various leadership styles, authentic leadership has emerged as a promising approach, characterized by “self‐awareness, transparency, balanced processing, internalised moral perspective, caring, shared decision making and moral/ethical courage” (Almutairi et al.2022, p. 1).
Authentic leaders exhibit alignment between their actions and their stated values, building trust and credibility within their teams (Avolio and Gardner2005).
By promoting open communication and fairness (Avolio et al.2004), authentic leaders create a culture of inclusivity and mutual respect.
A psychologically safe environment fostered by authentic leadership can enhance collaboration and empower nurses to address challenges more effectively while engaging in problem‐solving processes (Carmeli et al.2014; Newman et al.2017), both of which are essential for preventing missed nursing care.
While previous studies have explored the association between authentic leadership and psychological safety, as well as the influence of psychological safety on nurses’ turnover intention (Alilyyani et al.2022; Cho et al.2023), there is limited understanding of how authentic leadership and psychological safety individually influence missed nursing care.
Additionally, the mediating role of psychological safety in the relationship between authentic leadership and both missed nursing care and turnover intention has not been investigated.
Greater nurse unit manager authentic leadership is associated with a lower frequency of missed nursing care.
Greater nurse unit manager authentic leadership is associated with lower intention to leave.
Psychological safety mediates both of these relationships, such that greater nurse unit manager authentic leadership enhances nurses’ perceptions of psychological safety, which in turn are associated with reduced missed nursing care and reduced intention to leave.
Understanding these connections is crucial for developing evidence‐based strategies to improve patient care, enhance nurse retention, and create resilient healthcare systems that meet the needs of both nurses and patients.
This study aimed to examine the relationships between authentic leadership, missed nursing care, and intention to leave in hospital nurses, and to investigate the mediating role of psychological safety in these relationships.
This cross‐sectional descriptive study used online survey data collected from registered nurses (RNs) in the United States between April 2021 and July 2022.
The study is part of a larger project focused on nurse fatigue using a multilevel approach (Cho et al.2025).
The STROBE checklist for cross‐sectional studies was adhered to in order to ensure rigorous reporting (von Elm et al.2007).
This study was conducted in 24 units across three hospitals located in the Midwest region of the United States.
Nurse managers and staff RNs providing direct patient care were invited to participate in an online survey.
Separate survey links for nurse managers and staff nurses were distributed via work email accounts, along with study information.
Participation was voluntary, and nurses who consented to participate provided responses.
Across the 24 units, the number of participating staff nurses varied, ranging from a minimum of 5 nurses to a maximum of 44 nurses per unit.
On average, 24 nurses per unit completed the survey.
The average response rate per unit was 57% (ranging from 13% to 80%).
Data from 504 staff nurses who responded to the key variables of this study were analyzed.
Using G*Power (version 3.1.9.7), we estimated that a sample of at least 194 nurses would be required to detect a medium effect size (f2= 0.15) with α = 0.05 and power = 0.95 in a multiple regression model with up to 14 predictors.
Our final sample of 504 exceeded this requirement and thus was deemed sufficient.
Nurses’ perceptions of authentic leadership from their nursing unit manager were assessed using the Authentic Leadership Inventory (ALI) (Neider and Schriesheim2011).
To ensure clarity, the survey instructions explicitly stated that the leader referenced in the items was the respondent's nursing unit manager.
The ALI includes 14 items assessed on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).
Following recommendations from the validation study of the ALI among U.S.
acute care nurses (Davidson et al.2018), we calculated an overall score by averaging the 14‐item responses.
The ALI has demonstrated content, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity, with good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha for subscales ranging from 0.70 to 0.82 and 0.93 for the overall scale) (Neider and Schriesheim2011; Davidson et al.2018).
In our study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.97.
A 7‐item scale designed by Edmondson (1999) was used to measure psychological safety.
To ensure clarity, the survey instructions stated: “Please indicate how accurately each statement describes the unit where you are currently working.” Nurses evaluated the psychological safety of their unit on a 5‐point Likert scale.
Following the reverse coding of three items, the mean score across all seven items was computed.
Higher scores indicate greater psychological safety as perceived by the nurses in their unit.
The content, criterion, and construct validity of this measure were established (Newman et al.2017).
In the original validation, Cronbach's alpha was reported as 0.82 (Edmondson1999), and in our study, the Cronbach's alpha was 0.81.
Missed nursing care was assessed using Part A of the MISSCARE Survey (Kalisch and Williams2009).
Participants were asked to report how frequently they had missed 24 specific nursing care activities, using a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = never missed to 5 = always missed).
An overall average score was calculated.
The MISSCARE Survey has demonstrated content and construct validity and test–retest reliability, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 (Kalisch and Williams2009).
In our study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.92.
A single item assessed nurses’ intention to leave their job: “How likely are you to leave your current job within the next year?” Responses were collected using a 4‐point Likert scale (1 = very unlikely to 4 = very likely).
A single‐item measure for assessing nurses’ intention to leave has been extensively utilized in various international studies (Cho et al.2023; Lee et al.2020; Zhang et al.2014) and is widely acknowledged as an effective indicator of actual turnover (Steel and Ovalle1984).
Nurses’ personal and work‐related variables (age, gender, marital status, highest degree in nursing, work schedule type, unit type, RN experience, and tenure in the current unit) were also collected and used in this study.
Additionally, we asked participants how frequently they had cared for patients with COVID‐19 over the past month, recognizing that pandemic‐related patient care could influence nurses’ psychological stress, turnover intention, or perceptions of psychological safety (Cho et al.2023; Labrague and de Los Santos2021; Sagherian et al.2024).
Therefore, we included the frequency of caring for COVID‐19–positive patients as a potential confounder.
Data were analyzed using SPSS 26 software (IBM Corp).
Study variables were summarized using descriptive statistics.
Skewness values were used to evaluate the normality of continuous variables, all of which fell within the acceptable range of ±1.5.
For the dependent variable of missed nursing care, a multiple linear regression model was applied.
For the dependent variable of intention to leave, a multiple logistic regression model was used.
Responses to the intention to leave question were dichotomized as very likely and somewhat likely to leave, coded as 1, and very unlikely and unlikely to leave, coded as 0.
Missing values were less than 5% for some variables and were addressed using listwise deletion.
Based on prior studies (Cho et al.2023; Lee et al.2020; Jones et al.2015), all models were adjusted for the following covariates due to their potential relationship with the dependent variables: age, gender, marital status, highest nursing degree, work schedule type, unit type, unit experience, and frequency of providing care to patients with COVID‐19.
The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance values were examined for all tested models, and no evidence of multicollinearity was found, as VIF values were below 5 and tolerance values exceeded 0.1.
To test the mediation effect of psychological safety, Model 4 of the PROCESS was employed (Hayes2018).
The significance of the indirect mediation effect for each dependent variable was evaluated using bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples and a 95% confidence interval (CI).
Ethical approval for the parent study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the affiliated institution (IRB#: 2021‐0405), and the current study received separate approval (IRB# 2025‐0007).
Recruitment and data collection were carried out by researchers who were not affiliated with the participating hospitals.
Participation in the study was completely voluntary, and participants were advised that they could withdraw at any point.
Nurses interested in participating received detailed explanations about the study's aim and clear instructions on how to complete the survey.
No identifiable information was collected, and all data were gathered through an anonymous online survey to ensure participant confidentiality.
The nurses’ mean age was 35.10 years (SD = 9.66; Table1).
Most participants were female (90.5%), and about half were married or had a partner (52.5%).
Regarding work schedules, 43.7% of nurses worked regular day shifts, while 35.3% worked regular night shifts.
The largest proportion of nurses (57.5%) were employed in general medical‐surgical units.
Approximately 42.0% of nurses had 3 to 8 years of RN experience, and 46.5% had 2 years or less of experience in their current unit.
More than half of the nurses (54.9%) reported never or very rarely providing care to patients with COVID‐19.
Nurses’ personal and work‐related characteristics.
The mean scores for authentic leadership and psychological safety were 3.75 (SD = 0.77) and 3.65 (SD = 0.62), respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Table2).
The mean score for missed nursing care was 2.67 (SD = 0.48), with a range from 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum).
Regarding intention to leave, 23.0% of nurses reported being very unlikely to leave their current job, while 31.7% were somewhat unlikely.
Conversely, 33.3% indicated they were somewhat likely to leave, and 11.9% reported being very likely to leave.
Nurses who perceived their unit manager as having greater authentic leadership were less likely to report missed nursing care tasks (B= −0.10, 95% CI [−0.16, −0.03]) and less likely to intend to leave (OR = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.92]; Table3).
Nurses working in units with higher psychological safety levels were less likely to report missed care tasks (B= −0.14, 95% CI [−0.22, −0.06]) and less likely to report intending to leave their current job (OR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.34, 0.76]).
Age, gender, marital status, highest nursing degree, work schedule type, unit type, unit experience, and frequency of providing care to patients with COVID‐19 were included as covariates in all models.
Responses for intention to leave were dichotomized as very likely or somewhat likely to leave (1) versus very unlikely or somewhat unlikely to leave (0).
The results of the mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect effect of nurse managers’ authentic leadership on both dependent variables through psychological safety.
A higher level of authentic leadership was significantly associated with greater psychological safety (coefficient = 0.37,p< 0.001; Figure1).
For missed nursing care, the indirect effect of authentic leadership through psychological safety was significant (coefficient = −0.05, boot CI [−0.09, −0.02]).
The indirect effect of authentic leadership on intention to leave through psychological safety was also significant (OR = 0.78, boot CI [0.65, 0.91]).
The mediator, psychological safety, accounted for approximately 34.9% of the effect on missed nursing care and 38.2% of the effect on intention to leave.
This study investigated the relationships among authentic leadership, psychological safety, missed nursing care, and turnover intention among hospital nurses.
By assessing the influence of authentic leadership and psychological safety on nurses’ missed care and turnover intention, this study adds to the literature on effective strategies for improving patient care quality and nurse retention.
The findings revealed that the authentic leadership of unit nurse managers was positively associated with psychological safety at the unit, which, in turn, was associated with lower levels of missed nursing care and a reduced intention to leave among hospital staff nurses.
Psychological safety was found to be a significant mediator in the relationships between authentic leadership and both missed nursing care and intention to leave.
These results suggested that leadership style and a supportive work environment are critical components of high‐quality nursing practice and workforce stability.
Our findings showed the importance of authentic leadership of nurse managers in reducing staff nurses’ missed nursing care and lowering their intention to leave.
Authentic leadership fosters trust and collaboration within teams by building supportive relationships that empower staff, enhancing their sense of belonging and professional engagement (Almutairi et al.2025; Walumbwa et al.2008; Zhang et al.2022).
In alignment with our findings, previous studies have demonstrated that authentic leadership can decrease nurses’ intention to leave by promoting job satisfaction and organizational commitment (Almutairi et al.2025; Alilyyani et al.,2022).
Although numerous studies have examined the connection between authentic leadership and nurses’ work attitudes or well‐being (Almutairi et al.2025; Zhang et al.2022), its role in reducing missed nursing care has received limited attention (McCauley et al.2020).
Addressing this gap, this study suggested that authentic leadership by nurse managers may help address critical aspects of nursing care quality.
Nurse managers, as key figures in shaping work environments and team cultures (Cummings et al.2018), can significantly influence staff nurses’ practices and outcomes.
Consistent with previous studies, our study emphasizes the crucial role of unit managers’ authentic leadership in fostering a positive work environment (Almutairi et al.2025), which supports high‐quality nursing care.
One possible mechanism through which authentic leadership influences missed nursing care is by enhancing team effectiveness (Alilyyani et al.2022).
Through their focus on ethical conduct, transparency, and collaboration, authentic leaders may improve team dynamics, enabling members to better address challenges, prioritize tasks, and optimize resource use.
This enhanced team functioning could mitigate some of the key factors contributing to missed care, such as time constraints and resource limitations.
Importantly, our study identified psychological safety as a significant mediator between authentic leadership and both missed nursing care and intention to leave.
Authentic leaders may foster psychological safety by encouraging open communication, promoting inclusivity, and reassuring team members that they can express concerns without fear of negative consequences (Almutairi et al.2025; Yagi et al.2024).
For instance, authentic leaders may actively support staff in voicing challenges related to care delivery or interpersonal dynamics, creating a safe space for addressing issues that might otherwise hinder patient care.
When guided by authentic nurse managers, staff nurses are more likely to feel secure in expressing their opinions, asking questions, and engaging in open discussions (Yagi et al.2024).
This enhanced psychological safety within the team can strengthen team dynamics and improve communication about patient needs and care requirements (Cho et al.2023; Newman et al.2017), thereby reducing the likelihood of missed care.
The positive relationship between psychological safety and open communication among unit nurses has been demonstrated in previous research (Cho et al.2023).
Additionally, nurses in psychologically safe teams are more likely to seek help or clarification when needed, further supporting comprehensive and effective care delivery.
Psychological safety also contributes to a sense of value and respect among nurses, which can strengthen their attachment to their roles and decrease their intention to leave (Newman et al.2017).
Nurses who perceive their work environments as psychologically safe are more likely to feel satisfied and supported, making them more inclined to remain in their positions (Almutairi et al.2025).
Our findings suggested that psychological safety can contribute to both improved patient care quality and workforce stability, with authentic leadership playing a crucial role in effective nursing management.
By promoting psychological safety, authentic leadership helps build a supportive organizational culture that enhances care outcomes and improves nurse retention.
Our study indicated that fostering authentic leadership and promoting psychological safety in nursing units can be effective strategies to enhance nursing care quality and retention.
Specifically, authentic leadership improved psychological safety, reduced missed nursing care, and decreased nurses’ intention to leave, highlighting its important role in addressing organizational challenges.
Healthcare organizations should invest in structured training programs to develop authentic leadership skills among nurse managers.
These programs could include modules on authentic leadership principles, self‐awareness, and essential leadership skills such as change management, purpose‐driven vision, stakeholder engagement, and organizational culture (Brewer and Devnew2022).
Creating a psychologically safe environment is also important for reducing missed nursing care and turnover.
Interventions such as educational programs using simulations, video‐based learning, case studies, and interactive workshops, along with non‐educational approaches like holistic facilitation, participatory action sessions, and performance‐based role play, can contribute to enhancing psychological safety in nursing units (O'Donovan and McAuliffe2020).
Regular assessments of psychological safety using validated tools, such as Edmondson's (1999) scale, could provide actionable insights for organizational improvement.
Beyond leadership training for managers, it is equally essential to support managers to ensure they can effectively exercise their leadership roles.
This includes monitoring their workload, workplace experiences, and burnout, which may hinder their leadership effectiveness (Kelly et al.2019; Nelson2017).
Organizations should offer resources to manage workload, alleviate stress, and improve workplace conditions, enabling managers to foster positive unit cultures and improve nursing outcomes.
This study has some limitations to consider.
First, data were collected between April 2021 and July 2022, overlapping with the COVID‐19 pandemic.
Although we adjusted for the frequency of caring for COVID‐19–positive patients as a confounding variable, the broader pandemic context may still have introduced additional complexities that were not fully captured in our analysis.
Consequently, key variables in our study, including psychological safety and turnover intention, may have been impacted by pandemic‐related factors beyond those we measured.
Second, this study used a cross‐sectional descriptive design, which limits the ability to determine causal relationships among the study variables.
Future studies employing longitudinal designs are needed to replicate and expand upon these findings.
Next, all study variables were measured using self‐reported surveys, which may introduce recall and social desirability biases.
Future research could use objective data sources like electronic health records to assess missed nursing care or evaluations from peers or supervisors to provide additional perspectives.
Lastly, this study was conducted at three hospitals, which could restrict the broader applicability of the findings.
Further research should be conducted across diverse settings, including multiple hospitals and units, to enhance the external validity of the results and ensure broader applicability.
This study provided valuable insights into the mediating role of psychological safety in the relationships between authentic leadership, missed nursing care, and nurses’ intention to leave.
The findings underscore the importance of cultivating authentic leadership among nurse managers to foster psychologically safe unit environments, which in turn can reduce missed nursing care and enhance nurse retention.
Organizational efforts to strengthen nurse managers’ authentic leadership through targeted training, resource support, and relevant policies are essential for improving psychological safety, patient care quality, and nurses' job outcomes.
