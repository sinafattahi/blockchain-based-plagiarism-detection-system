Testican‐1 is a promising biomarker for sepsis, with potential applications in both diagnosis and treatment monitoring in human medicine.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Testican‐1 as a biomarker in feline sepsis, using pyometra as a model for naturally occurring sepsis.
The study was conducted on a total of 30 cats from different breeds, aged between 1 and 8 years.
The cats were divided into three groups on the basis of the owner's history, physical and gynaecological examination findings, diagnostic ultrasonography results and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.
The control group (Group 1,n= 10) consisted of healthy cats without pyometra symptoms, the non‐septic pyometra group (Group 2,n= 10) included cats with pyometra but not meeting the SIRS criteria, and the septic pyometra group (Group 3,n= 10) included cats with pyometra that met the SIRS criteria.
The obtained data were analysed using one‐way ANOVA.
It was found that body temperature and pulse values were significantly higher in the non‐septic and septic pyometra groups compared to the control group (p< 0.001).
Respiratory rate did not show a significant difference between the control group and the non‐septic pyometra group (p> 0.05), but it was significantly higher in the septic pyometra group (p< 0.001).
White blood cell (WBC) counts were significantly higher in the non‐septic and septic pyometra groups compared to the control group (p< 0.001).
Glucose, creatinine, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) values did not show significant differences between the control group and the non‐septic pyometra group (p> 0.05) but were significantly higher in the septic pyometra group (p< 0.001).
Serum amyloid A (SAA) and Testican‐1 levels were significantly higher in both non‐septic and septic pyometra groups compared to the control group (p< 0.001).
Correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between Testican‐1 and heart rate (r= −0.864,p< 0.01) and creatinine (r= −0.584,p< 0.01).
In contrast, significant positive correlations were found between Testican‐1 and body temperature (r= 0.929,p< 0.01), respiratory rate (r= 0.844,p< 0.01), WBC (r= 0.955,p< 0.01), glucose (r= 0.865,p< 0.01), CRP (r= 0.993,p< 0.01) and SAA (r= 0.971,p< 0.01).
In conclusion, it was concluded that Testican‐1 could be used as a novel biomarker for the detection of sepsis in pyometra cats.
This study evaluated whether Testican‐1 is a potential biomarker for feline sepsis using a model for natural sepsis in cases of pyometra, a common gynaecological disease in cats.
The study concluded that Testican‐1 is an important step in the evaluation of feline sepsis.
Sepsis is a significant health issue associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in both animals and humans worldwide.
It is characterized by life‐threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection (Singer et al.2016).
Early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, particularly the timely administration of antimicrobial therapy, are critical for survival (Dellinger et al.2013).
However, sepsis diagnosis is clinically challenging because its symptoms are often nonspecific and vague.
The management of sepsis is further complicated by the complex interactions of inflammatory mediators, cytokines, chemokines and acute‐phase reactants activated in response to infection.
The ensuing cytokine storm leads to dysregulation of the host response and organ dysfunction, which exacerbates the disease.
In dogs, mortality rates can be as high as 79% when septic shock occurs (Declue et al.2011).
Therefore, the investigation of reliable biomarkers that could aid in the early diagnosis of sepsis, assessment of the response to treatment and determination of prognosis is of great importance.
Given that inflammatory response mechanisms are similar in both cats and humans, sepsis biomarkers identified in cats could provide valuable information for both veterinary and human medicine.
Pyometra is a serious inflammatory condition affecting female cats and is considered one of the most significant reproductive diseases in cats (Agudelo2005).
This disease is characterized by the accumulation of purulent exudate in the uterus (Dellinger et al.2013) and develops as a result of the accumulation of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, along with endometrial glandular expansion and the formation of cystic structures (Hagman2018).
In some cases, bacterial colonies associated with the inflammatory process may also be detected (Nak et al.2005).
Pyometra poses a significant challenge to veterinarians and pet owners due to its insidious clinical course and potentially fatal complications.
This highlights the necessity of rapid diagnosis and emergency medical intervention (Satılmış2023; Rautela and Katiyar2019).
Testican‐1 is a highly conserved chimeric proteoglycan that carries chondroitin and heparan sulphate chains.
It was first identified in human seminal plasma and initially referred to as a peptide carrying glycosaminoglycans from seminal plasma and a precursor of SPOCK (Charbonnier et al.2000).
The name SPOCK is derived from the modular nature of the core protein, which consists of four SPARC/osteonectin domains, CWCV (Cys‐Trp‐Cys‐Val amino acid sequence) and Kazal‐like domains (Charbonnier et al.2000).
Testican‐1 is a member of the BM‐40/SPARC/osteonectin family of extracellular calcium‐binding proteins.
It is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the thalamus, and is upregulated in activated astrocyte cells in the cerebrum (Marr and Edgell2003).
However, the biological function of Testican‐1 has not yet been extensively studied.
Recent studies have shown that Testican‐1 levels are associated with the severity of the disease in septic patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker that could improve the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis (Bae et al.2014; Yoo et al.2015).
This study aims to evaluate whether Testican‐1 is a potential biomarker in feline sepsis, using pyometra as a model for naturally occurring sepsis.
The study was conducted on 30 female cats brought to the Animal Hospital of Harran University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.
The cats included in the study were between 1 and 8 years old and of different breeds.
All cats were diagnosed as healthy and pyometra on the basis of the anamnesis, physical and gynaecological examination findings obtained from their owners and abdominal B‐mode ultrasonography examination results.
Ultrasonography was performed in the ventro‐dorsal position as described by Safak et al. (2025). During this examination, the ovaries and uterus were visualized.
We used a B‐mode ultrasound with a 5–10 MHz transducer and a linear probe (Sonosite Edge II, USA) for transabdominal ultrasound testing to determine whether cats had pyometra.
Cats with pyometra were divided into septic and non‐septic pyometra groups according to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.
The control group (Group 1,n= 10) consisted of healthy cats without signs of pyometra, the non‐septic pyometra group (Group 2,n= 10) included pyometrial cats that did not meet the SIRS criteria and the septic pyometra group (Group 3,n= 10) consisted of pyometrial cats that met the SIRS criteria.
The pyometrial cats were classified as septic and non‐septic according to the traditional SIRS criteria (Greiner et al.2008).
Sepsis diagnosis was made if three or more of the following four clinical parameters were met: body temperature (<37.2°C or >39.4°C), heart rate (<140 or >225 beats/min), respiratory rate (>40 breaths/min) and white blood cell (WBC) count (<5 or >19 × 109cells/L).
Cats meeting the SIRS criteria were classified into the septic pyometra group, whereas those not meeting the criteria were classified into the non‐septic pyometra group.
Additionally, cats with concurrent secondary diseases were excluded from the study.
Cats that had received any medication or undergone surgical interventions within the last 2 months prior to blood analysis were also excluded from the study (Figure1).

CRP, C‐reactive protein; SAA, serum amyloid A; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
Venous blood samples were collected from cats in all groups before any application.
The collected blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min (NÜVE NF 200, Ankara, Türkiye) to obtain serum, which was stored at −20°C until the day of analysis.
Blood samples for haematological and biochemical measurements were collected in tubes containing K3‐EDTA, and blood biochemistry (Seamaty SMT‐120V, Notavet, İzmir, Turkey) and complete blood count tests (Mindray BC‐30Vet, Shenzhen, China) were performed.
WBC, glucose and creatinine levels were evaluated.
Serum Testican‐1 levels in the study groups were determined using a commercial kit (Cat Testican‐1 (SPOCK) ELISA Kit, MBS9351874, MyBioSource Inc., USA).
Serum C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured using a commercial kit (Cat C Reactive Protein ELISA Kit, ICL lab, Oregon, USA).
Serum amyloid A (SAA) levels were determined using a commercial kit (Cat Serum Amyloid A ELISA Kit, MBS067673, MyBioSource Inc., USA).
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26 software.
The normality of the variables was assessed using visual methods (histograms and probability plots) and analytical methods (Kolmogorov–Smirnov/Shapiro–Wilk tests).
Descriptive analyses for variables showing normal distribution were presented using mean and standard deviation.
Differences between groups for parameters determined to be normally distributed were compared using one‐way ANOVA.
In cases where significant differences between groups were found, pairwise post hoc comparisons were conducted using the Tukey test.
The correlation measure and statistical significance between the data were determined using the Pearson test.
A significance level of 5% was considered for statistical significance.

As pyometra progresses, sepsis, endotoxemic shock or SIRS may develop, potentially leading to death (Fransson et al.2007; Jang et al.2024).
Sepsis is a systemic syndrome triggered by an abnormal and excessive response to infection, and the mortality rate in cats ranges from 29% to 79% (Koiyama et al.2022).
This wide range reflects the diagnostic challenges and individual differences in sepsis.
Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are critical for managing sepsis (Leong et al.2021; Siemińska and Arent2024).
One of the most common methods for diagnosing sepsis in cats is the SIRS criteria (Babyak and Sharp2016; Alves et al.2020).
However, these criteria are non‐specific and can be triggered by conditions such as anxiety, pain or stress (Ghezzi et al.2024).
The silent progression of sepsis and the lack of classic signs in cats limit the effectiveness of diagnostic criteria (Klainbart et al.2017).
Therefore, identifying specific biomarkers is important.
In our study, we provide evidence supporting the potential of Testican‐1 as a sepsis marker in cats with pyometra.
In our study, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of age and weight.
However, temperature values were higher in the septic pyometra group, which was considered an indicator of sepsis.
Sepsis is characterized by triggering a systemic inflammation response, which usually leads to an increase in body temperature.
This finding has been reported as a clinical sign of sepsis in previous studies (Garami et al.2018; Doman et al.2023).
In our study, it was observed that WBC levels reached significantly higher values in the septic pyometra group.
This is a typical finding reflecting the inflammatory response associated with sepsis in pyometra.
An increase in WBCs indicates the body's immune response to infection and demonstrates the activation of the immune system during the sepsis process (Ankomah et al.2023).
Similarly, previous studies have reported a significant increase in WBC values in septic patients (Di et al.2020).
However, it has also been reported that in some patients, WBC values may be low due to immune system failure (Park and Kang2021).
On the other hand, in our study, the glucose levels were also elevated in the septic pyometra group, reflecting the body's sepsis response and indicating metabolic stress (Furushima et al.2021).
Hyperglycaemia during sepsis may arise due to the effects of hormones regulating energy use and stress responses, particularly the increase in cortisol and catecholamines, which can cause a significant rise in glucose levels (Duggan et al.2017).
Hyperglycaemia is a commonly observed condition in septic patients, and disturbances in glucose metabolism are related to the severity of the disease (Rivas and Nugent 2021).
Although no significant difference in creatinine levels was found between the control and non‐septic pyometra groups, a notable decrease was observed in the septic pyometra group.
This suggests that there may be a temporary increase in kidney perfusion as a result of hyperfiltration and systemic vasodilation during sepsis (Calzavacca et al.2015).
However, considering the risk of kidney function deterioration in the later stages of sepsis, long‐term monitoring of creatinine levels may be clinically important.
Hypoperfusion during sepsis, the effects of inflammatory mediators, and microvascular changes can lead to acute kidney injury, and an increase in creatinine levels may be observed in the later stages (Lee et al.2022).
Therefore, regular monitoring of kidney function in pyometrical and septic cats could play a critical role in early detection of potential complications.
The significantly elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP and SAA in the septic pyometra group further support the association of these biomarkers with sepsis and inflammation.
CRP is commonly used as an indicator of acute inflammatory responses (Malin and Witkowska‐Piłaszewicz2022; Plebani2023), which aligns with our findings.
High CRP levels in septic patients are an indicator of the inflammatory process and may correlate with the severity of the disease (Liang and Yu2022).
SAA is one of the acute‐phase proteins, synthesized by the liver, especially during infection and inflammation (Uhlar and Whitehead1999).
In our study, it was observed that SAA levels were significantly higher in cats with septic pyometra, which can be considered a sign of the systemic inflammatory process (Salama et al.2019).
The most striking finding in our study was the significant increase in Testican‐1 levels in the septic pyometra group.
This finding strengthens the potential of Testican‐1 as a sepsis‐associated biomarker.
Another important biological role of Testican‐1 in sepsis is its reflection of the body's response to inflammation and tissue damage (Lee et al.2018).
Studies by Lee et al. (2018) and Wu et al. (2019) have shown that Testican‐1 is present at elevated levels in sepsis patients and is associated with disease severity.
Similarly, our study demonstrated that Testican‐1 levels were significantly higher in cats with sepsis.
Experimental models have shown that exposure to conditions that induce sepsis leads to an increase in Testican‐1 synthesis and secretion in mice.
This suggests that Testican‐1 plays an active role in the body's response to sepsis and may be important in processes like tissue repair and cellular signalling (Lee et al.2018).
During sepsis, the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and the remodelling of the extracellular matrix are critical, and it is believed that Testican‐1 plays a regulatory role in these processes (Berger et al.2011).
Septic shock has a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatments (Marques et al.2023).
Sepsis and septic shock are complex processes characterized by inflammation, microvascular dysfunction and immune imbalance, resulting from an excessive response to infection by the organism (Singer et al.2016).
Early diagnosis and determining the severity of the disease continue to pose significant challenges in treatment (Plata‐Menchaca et al.2024).
Biomarkers such as CRP, procalcitonin (PCT), serum intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (sICAM‐1), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), von Willebrand factor (vWF) protein and N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) have been suggested for evaluating the severity of sepsis (Ríos‐Toro et al.2017; Liu et al.2021).
However, none of these markers fully reflect a single biological aspect of sepsis, and they are not sufficient on their own to determine clinical outcomes.
CRP and PCT are widely used biomarkers that play a role in evaluating infection and inflammation (Mitaka2005).
However, these biomarkers are not specific and can be elevated in viral infections and autoimmune diseases as well (Grosmann et al.2021; Rizo‐Téllez et al.2023).
Similarly, although IL‐6 and sICAM‐1 are inflammatory markers associated with sepsis, their variability and the possibility of remaining low in some patients limit their clinical use (Li et al. 2023; Liu and Chen 2024).
vWF, an important glycoprotein reflecting endothelial dysfunction, remains of low specificity for sepsis (Page and Liles2013).
NT‐proBNP is considered a cardiac stress marker, but it is not specific to sepsis (Guaricci et al.2015).
Therefore, there is a need for new biomarkers that are more directly related to the pathogenesis of sepsis.
Testican‐1, a proteoglycan involved in inflammation and endothelial activation, has been found to be directly associated with the severity of sepsis (Lee et al.2018).
Testican‐1 is thought to be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis in septic patients (Wu et al.2019).
In conclusion, this study represents an important step in evaluating Testican‐1 as a sepsis marker in cats.
This research, which examines the relationship between pyometra and sepsis, shows that Testican‐1 levels are significantly higher in septic cats compared to healthy and non‐septic pyometra cats.
These findings suggest that Testican‐1 may be a potential biomarker for sepsis diagnosis, assessment of disease severity and treatment guidance.
However, further advanced research is required to better understand the mechanisms associated with Testican‐1 in sepsis.
Specifically, investigating its connections with tissue damage, microvascular inflammation and organ failure is vital for the clinical integration of Testican‐1.
Additionally, the role of Testican‐1 in early sepsis diagnosis and its prognostic value, when used in combination with other biomarkers, need to be determined through more clinical studies.
Future research, using larger sample sizes and Testican‐1 measurements throughout the treatment process, will more clearly define how this biomarker can play a role in sepsis treatment and recovery monitoring.
In this way, Testican‐1 can become an important tool in sepsis management and treatment follow‐up.
