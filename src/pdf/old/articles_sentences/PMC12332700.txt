To explore the association between community engagement and life satisfaction amongst older adults, with a focus on the mediating effect of social capital and the moderating effects of gender and age.
This study used structural equation modelling to analyse data from a sample of 1036 older adults in Chengdu, China, examining both the direct and indirect effects of community engagement on life satisfaction through social capital, and whether the relations moderated by gender and age.
Model fit was evaluated usingχ2, Comparative Fit Index, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation and Standardised Root Mean Square Residual to ensure the validity of the proposed relationships.
The findings indicated a significant positive relationship between community engagement and social capital (β= .54) as well as between social capital and life satisfaction (β= .28).
Social capital fully mediated the association between community engagement and life satisfaction.
Moderation analysis revealed that the effects of community engagement and social capital on life satisfaction were stronger amongst older males (β= .57 and .32) than older females (β= .52 and .26).
This study highlights the significant role of community engagement in enhancing social capital and life satisfaction amongst older adults in China, particularly for males and individuals aged 70 years or older.
Findings indicate that policymakers should prioritise the development and implementation of community engagement programs specifically designed to support older men and individuals aged 70 years or older.
It underscores the importance of culturally specific strategies for promoting active ageing in China.
Promoting community engagement and social capital can significantly enhance life satisfaction in older adults, particularly older men and those over 70 years.
Policies should support tailored programs in community centres, focusing on social networking and engagement to build social capital and improve life satisfaction, addressing gender and age disparities in outcomes.
This study was grounded in the ecological model, social capital theory and the active ageing perspective to (1) explore the impact of community engagement on life satisfaction; (2) investigate the mediating role of social capital in this relationship; and (3) examine whether gender and age moderate these effects.
Given that social roles, opportunities for engagement and access to social capital often differ by gender and age, these factors may shape the extent to which community engagement influences life satisfaction.2,11The theoretical model is depicted in Figure1.
The study hypothesised: (1) Community engagement is positively linked to social capital; (2) Social capital is positively related to life satisfaction; (3) Social capital mediates the effect of community engagement on life satisfaction; and (4) Demographic factors (gender and age) moderate these relationships.
Conceptual model of community engagement, social support and loneliness.
While prior research has shown the link between community engagement and life satisfaction through social capital, the mediating role of social capital and moderating effects of age and gender remain underexplored in older adults in China.
This study aimed to address these gaps and offer insights for policies aimed at improving the well‐being of China's ageing population.
This study employed a convenience sampling approach due to its feasibility in reaching a diverse sample of older adults engaged in community activities.
Based on statistical data provided by the city government, five communities with a high proportion of retired older adults were selected for participant recruitment.
The inclusion criteria for the sampling process required individuals to meet the following conditions: (1) residency in one of the five selected communities, (2) age 50 years or older and (3) retired from employment at the time of the survey.
Individuals who were actively employed at the time of data collection were excluded from the study.
Each selected community comprised approximately 250 retirees.
With the assistance of local social workers and street‐level committees, surveys were distributed to retired older adults at local senior centres.
From April 27 to June 27, 2022, we distributed 1167 questionnaires to older adults based in Chengdu, China.
Of the 1167 surveys distributed, 1085 completed surveys were returned.
However, 49 surveys were missing key data variables and were subsequently removed from the study.
Our final sample size was 1036.
The sample size exceeds the minimum required for detecting medium effect sizes (Cohen'sd= .5) in regression analyses with 80% power at a .05 significance level, even when accounting for multiple predictors (k= 5–10), requiring around 60–100 participants.
This ensured robust statistical power for detecting meaningful associations while accommodating subgroup analyses.
Participants were informed that the survey was voluntary, with the option to withdraw at any time.
Each received 3 RMB (0.5 USD) as compensation.
The research protocol was approved by the Review Committee of the Research Institute of Social Development, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Protocol #2022002), and informed consent was obtained before starting the survey.
Life satisfaction was measured using the 20‐item Life Satisfaction Index A (LSIA) by Neugarten et al. (1961), known for strong reliability and validity.10,34Participants rated statements on a 3‐point Likert scale (‘agree’ = 2, ‘uncertain’ = 1, ‘disagree’ = 0).
Negatively worded items were reverse‐coded, with total scores ranging from 0 to 40.
The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .82.
Community engagement was measured using eight items from a reliable and valid scale for Chinese populations.35Participants reported the frequency of their interactions with neighbours, community organisations and governance committees on a scale from 1 (‘never’) to 4 (‘frequently’).
Scores were averaged to create a community engagement score, with a Cronbach's alpha of .86.
Social capital was measured using the 42‐item Personal Social Capital Scale (PSCS),36known for good reliability and validity.37The PSCS includes 10 subconstructs, divided into bonding and bridging social capital (five each).
Participants rated items on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = ‘none’, 5 = ‘all’).
Subconstruct scores were averaged to calculate bonding, bridging and overall social capital, with total scores ranging from 10 to 50.
Cronbach's alpha values were .87 for bonding, .90 for bridging and .91 overall.
We analysed the data using STATA version 16.0.
First, descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation were used to examine sample characteristics and variable relationships.
We then applied structural equation modelling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation to assess the direct and indirect effects of community engagement on life satisfaction via social capital.
Model fit was evaluated usingχ2, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) (>.95), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) (<.08) and Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) (<.08).
We also tested the moderation effects of gender and age within the SEM.
Additional regression analyses, controlling for relevant covariates, including gender, age, education, marital status and number of children, produced consistent findings.
The SEM analysis was selected as the preferred analytical approach due to its capacity to simultaneously examine both direct and indirect effects of the mediating variable.
In the social capital regression model, the community engagement coefficient was .5438 without covariates and slightly decreased to .5413 with covariates.

The correlations for the key variables are presented in Table1.
The correlation analysis results supported our hypotheses.
Community engagement was positively correlated with social capital (r= .54,p< .001) and life satisfaction (r= .17,p< .001).
Similarly, social capital had a positive correlation with life satisfaction (r= .28,p< .01).

The standardised estimates for the SEM model are shown in Figure2.
The model fit indices indicated a good fit:χ2(1) = .62,p> .05; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = .00; SRMR = .01.
Community engagement was found to have a positive and significant effect on social capital (β= .54,p< .001), supporting Hypothesis 1.
Consistent with Hypothesis 2, social capital directly and positively influenced life satisfaction (β= .28,p< .001).
The SEM analysis revealed that social capital fully mediated the relationship between community engagement and life satisfaction.
Additionally, an indirect effect of community engagement on life satisfaction through social capital was observed (β= .15,p< .001), supporting Hypothesis 3.

Table2lists the results of the moderation analysis.
Likelihood‐ratio tests showed that the effects of community engagement and social capital on life satisfaction were significantly moderated by both gender and age.
Specifically, the impact of community engagement on social capital was stronger for older male participants compared to female participants (.57 vs. .52), and for individuals aged 70 years or older compared to those aged 60–69 years (.62 vs. .49).
Similarly, the influence of social capital was greater for older male participants compared to females (.32 vs. .26), and for those aged 70 years or older compared to participants aged 60–69 years (.40 vs. .29) or younger than 59 (.12).
Furthermore, the indirect effect of community engagement on life satisfaction via social capital was more pronounced for adults aged 70 years or older (.25) and for male participants (.18).
Direct and indirect effects of community engagement and social support on life satisfaction.
Second, active ageing programs should consider improving social capital amongst older adults.
Well‐designed social capital focused interventions can lead to improved physical and mental health amongst older adults.44,45For example, research indicates that the use of technologies, such as the internet and smartphones can enhance social capital amongst older adults.46,47,48However, given that technology may not be accessible or appropriate for all individuals, programs integrating technological components should be implemented thoughtfully and adapted to align with the specific needs and capacities of older adult populations.
Third, the results of the moderation analysis suggest that the effects of community engagement and social capital had stronger effects on life satisfaction for older adults aged 70 years or older.
Thus, government agencies can target this age demographic specifically to have the most effective impact.
Additionally, the findings indicate that community engagement and social capital had larger effects on life satisfaction for older males, possibly due to men's greater risk of social isolation following retirement and their reliance on limited social networks.27,49,50,51To address these gender differences, programs could consider promoting structured activities for men and building on existing social networks for women.
A gender‐sensitive approach may better enhance social capital and well‐being for all older adults.
This study had several limitations.
First, the cross‐sectional design restricted our ability to determine causal relationships between community engagement and social capital.
Future research could benefit from using a longitudinal approach to better explore the causal dynamics between these variables.
Second, convenience sampling may introduce selection bias and limit the generalisability of findings.
Future research should consider probability sampling to enhance the representativeness of the sample.
Third, the participants in this study were recruited from local community centres.
This recruitment approach may introduce selection bias, potentially overrepresenting older adults who are more socially active.
Thus, the findings may not fully capture the experiences of less socially active individuals.
Future research should employ more representative sampling methods to enhance the external validity of the results.
Fourth, while this study employed SEM to examine the relationships amongst key variables, potential confounding factors that were not accounted for in the analysis may influence the findings.
Unmeasured variables, such as personality traits and health conditions might contribute to variations in social capital, community engagement and life satisfaction.
Future research should incorporate additional control variables to further assess the robustness of the estimated relationships.
Additionally, the data relied on self‐reported responses from older adults residing in Chengdu, China.
While self‐reported data are common in research, it may be subject to biases that can influence the findings.
Finally, the sample for this study was limited to Chengdu, China, one of the country's largest cities, with a population exceeding 20 million in 2021.
The generalisability of the findings to cities of different sizes and rural communities remains uncertain.
Future research could explore the impact of geographic differences (e.g. rural areas, small and midsize cities) on community engagement, social capital and life satisfaction.
This study examined the relationship between community engagement, social capital and life satisfaction amongst older adults in Chengdu, China, with attention to age and gender differences.
By focusing on a non‐Western context, it contributes to the broader understanding of social engagement and well‐being in later life.
The findings underscore the importance of community engagement in enhancing life satisfaction through social capital, particularly for older males and adults aged 70 years or older.
These insights highlight the need for targeted, community‐based interventions that address the diverse needs of ageing populations and promote social connectedness as a pathway to well‐being.
