Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experience a high burden of cytomegalovirus infection (CMV R+) and long-term premature cognitive aging.
We tested whether CMV was associated with post-KT cognitive impairment.
In a 2-center prospective cohort study of 574 KTRs (mean age: 54.7 y), we obtained CMV donor/recipient (D/R) serostatus and measured pre- and post-KT cognitive function using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination.
We estimated post-KT global cognitive function trajectories by CMV serostatus using adjusted mixed effect models with linear spline terms.
Two hundred twenty-two (38.6%) recipients were CMV D+/R+, 100 (17.4%) were CMV D+/R–, 153 (26.6%) were CMV D–/R+, and 99 (17.2%) were CMV D–/R–.
At the time of KT, there were no significant differences in global cognitive function scores among KTRs irrespective of CMV D/R status.
Cognitive function equally improved in all CMV D/R groups during the first 3 y post-KT (slope = 0.62 points/year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-1.07).
However, during years 3–8 post-KT, the global cognitive function score trajectories significantly declined in the CMV D+/R+KTRs (slope = –3.51 points/year; 95% CI, –5.07 to –1.95) but not in the other groups, including CMV D–/R–(slope = 0.44 points/year; 95% CI, –2.12 to 3.00;P= 0.01), CMV D–/R+(slope = 0.13 points/year; 95% CI, –1.83 to 2.09), or CMV D+/R–(slope = 0.01 points/year; 95% CI, –1.87 to 1.89).
CMV D+/R+KTRs may be at elevated risk for post-KT cognitive impairment; clinicians may prioritize early interventions in this population.
Global cognitive impairment is common across all age groups among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs).1As expected, cognitive impairment is higher among older KTRs compared with younger KTRs at the time of KT (18–34 y: 9.1%; 35–49 y: 6.1%; 50–64 y: 9.3%; and 65 y and older: 15.7%).1KTRs with impairment in global cognitive function (10.5% versus 4.3%) and impairment in executive function (12.5% versus 2.3%) at KT admission are more likely to develop post-KT delirium compared with those without cognitive impairment.2Post-KT delirium is associated with higher risk of death-censored graft loss, all-cause mortality,3and a greater risk of dementia.2,3Post-KT, restoration of kidney function leads to cognitive improvement in many; however, a significant proportion of KTRs may continue to experience cognitive decline.4As KTRs are aging and living longer with functioning grafts, it is important to better understand why some are more likely to experience cognitive impairment.
This gap in knowledge requires investigating novel and potentially modifiable risk factors that may be contributing to cognitive decline post-KT.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.5,6Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, CMV is thought to contribute to a proinflammatory process that accompanies aging, also known as “inflammaging.”7Older KTRs have a high prevalence of CMV infection (CMV+) and are at particular risk for complications from CMV.8Older KTRs may experience reactivation of CMV in the setting of immune suppression, stress, and advanced aging, among others.9It is possible that compared with community-dwelling adults, this association between CMV and cognitive impairment mediated by inflammation may be enhanced in KTRs on maintenance immune suppression.
Knowledge of CMV donor and recipient (CMV D/R) serostatus at KT admission may help identify those who are likely to experience cognitive decline post-KT.
In KTRs, the CMV D/R serostatus mismatch is the greatest risk factor for CMV disease post-KT (CMV D+/R–).
CMV D–/R–KTRs are considered at the lowest risk of <5% for CMV disease post-KT, whereas the CMV D+/R+and CMV D–/R+KTRs are considered to be at intermediate risk for development of disease due to superinfection (CMV D+) or reactivation (CMV R+) in KTRs.10,11However, a recent review of real-world evidence showed that although the incidence of CMV disease in CMV D+/R–was higher than in CMV R+(25%–56% versus 4%–14%), the risk of CMV reinfection/reactivation was similar or lower in CMV D+/R–(5%–37%) than in CMV R+(15%–40%).12Because we postulate that the risk of cognitive impairment is worsened by the inflammation that accompanies the immune response to CMV reactivation, it may not parallel the risk of CMV disease, which is increased by the absence of an immune response.
We tested whether CMV D/R serostatus at KT admission was associated with pre- and post-KT cognitive impairment in a prospective longitudinal cohort study.
Specifically, we evaluated short-term (0–3 y) and long-term (3–8 y) trajectories of cognitive function among deceased donor KTRs stratified by CMV D/R serostatus.
We leveraged a 2-center prospective cohort study of 574 deceased donor KTRs (Figure S1, SDC,https://links.lww.com/TXD/A770).
Study participants were enrolled at the time of KT admission from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (August 2009–November 2018; n = 546) and the University of Michigan Medical Center (March 2015–November 2016; n = 28).
KTRs who were English-speaking and aged 18 y and older at enrollment were eligible for this cohort study.
Research associates, who were distinctly separate from the clinical team, made every attempt to approach and enroll all eligible recipients regardless of clinical indication without disrupting clinical care.
There were no differences between individuals who were approached and those who were not.
Our study population was limited to deceased donor KTRs and donors.
Cognitive function assessments were performed at the time of KT admission, and at routine clinical follow-ups post-KT (approximately 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo and then yearly) for up to 8 y. The majority of the patients received valganciclovir prophylaxis per institutional protocols.
Duration of valganciclovir prophylaxis was 6 mo for CMV D+/R–and 3 mo for CMV R+KTRs.
This study used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR).13The SRTR data system includes data on all donors, waitlisted candidates, and transplant recipients in the United States, submitted by the members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).
The Health Resources and Services Administration, US Department of Health and Human Services, provides oversight to the activities of the OPTN and SRTR contractors.
All clinical and research activities being reported are consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Declaration of Istanbul.
The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board and the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board.
All study participants provided written informed consent.
The SRTR includes CMV serology data collected by OPTN on all solid organ procurement organizations and transplant programs in the United States.
Transplant centers measure the CMV serology and report the results to OPTN.
The CMV serostatus for D/R at the time of KT admission was defined as CMV+if the CMV IgG antibody was recorded as positive and defined as CMV–if the CMV IgG antibody was recorded as negative in the SRTR.
Cognitive function, including global cognitive function and executive function, was measured by trained research associates at KT.
All research associates administered cognitive tests under the same protocol.
Global cognitive function was also measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
The MoCA, now covering 8 cognitive domains and scoring of 30, was developed on the basis of the clinical intuition of one of the authors (Z.N.)
regarding domains of impairment commonly encountered in mild cognitive impairment and best adapted to a screening test.
It is a commonly studied, clinically useful, and validated test of global cognitive function.
It is an alternative to the 3MS examination and measures cognitive performance across the whole continuum, with higher sensitivity for detecting mild cognitive impairment.18Lower score in MoCA indicates worse global cognitive function.
Executive function was measured using 2 tests, the Trail Making Test Part A (TMTA) and TMT Part B (TMTB)19; specifically, executive function is calculated as TMTB-TMTA to account for psychomotor speed.
The TMTA and TMTB are validated measures of executive function (ie, cognitive shifting, cognitive flexibility), attention, concentration, and psychomotor speed.20The tests measure the time required to connect a series of sequentially numbered (TMTA) and numbered/lettered (TMTB) circles.
Needing more time to complete the tests indicates worse executive function.
The times are capped at 3 min for TMTA and 5 min for TMTB.
For characteristics at KT admission, we calculated means with SDs for normally distributed continuous variables (age and BMI), medians with interquartile ranges for nonnormally distributed continuous variables (dialysis time and CCI), and percentages for categorical characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, cause of end-stage renal disease, comorbidities, frailty, education and immunosuppression regimen usage); differences in characteristics by CMV serostatus were tested using ANOVA tests for normally distributed continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests for nonnormally distributed continuous variables, and Pearson’s chi square tests for categorical variables.
We examined unadjusted global cognitive function score trajectories during the first 8 y post-KT using quadratic prediction plots stratified by CMV D/R serostatus.
We then quantified global and domain 3MS score trajectories overall and by CMV D/R serostatus using an unadjusted mixed effect model with random slope (time) and random intercept (person) with an unstructured covariance, separately.
Given the exploratory data analysis result from the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method, we included a linear spline term to account for the change in slope after 3 y post-KT.
The baseline covariates included in the model were age at KT, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI at KT, years on pre-KT dialysis, CCI, frailty, and education.
All covariates included were known risk factors for cognitive impairment21-23and potentially associated with CMV infection in the literature.24-26The reference population was defined as non-frail non-Hispanic White male KTRs aged 54.7 y (mean), whose BMI was 27.8 kg/m2(mean), and CCI was 1 (median), with no pre-KT dialysis (0 y on dialysis) and less than a college education.
Additionally, we tested whether the estimated post-KT global and domain cognitive function score trajectories differed by CMV D/R serostatus by including interaction terms by time and CMV indicators.
Wald tests were used to test the significance of interactions overall and by CMV D/R serostatus.
Point estimates of the 3MS score at baseline overall and by CMV D/R serostatus were presented.
Difference of point estimates at baseline (parameter values of CMV D/R serostatus) and difference of trajectories (separate interaction terms) by CMV D/R serostatus were also presented, respectively.
We also investigated the respective cross-sectional association between CMV D/R serostatus, and TMTs and MoCA tests with linear regression.
The same set of baseline covariates was used.
Due to limited measurements, we were unable to model the trajectories for those tests.
Model covariates have complete data except for CCI (missing 0.3%; n = 3); therefore, we used complete case analysis for our final model.
All analyses were performed using Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Two-sidedPvalues of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding those who had previous KTs for global 3MS trajectories.
Among the 574 KTRs, the mean age was 54.7 y (SD 13.0), 37.5% were women, and 50.2% were non-Hispanic Black.
The median number of years on dialysis was 3.6 y (interquartile range, 1.3–6.2); 70.7% of participants were undergoing pre-KT hemodialysis, and 15.9% were undergoing peritoneal dialysis; 46.1% of participants reported college education and more, and 19.2% were frail.
Compared with CMV D–/R–KTRs, CMV D–/R+and CMV D+/R+KTRs were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, to report less than a college education, and to report HIV infection (Table1).

At KT admission, compared with CMV D–/R–KTRs, KTRs with other CMV D/R status (CMV D–/R+: 3MS, 93.0 [95% confidence interval [CI], 91.2-94.8];P= 0.70; CMV D+/R+: 3MS, 93.4 [95% CI, 91.8-95.0];P= 0.94; and CMV D+/R–: 3MS, 93.9 [95% CI, 92.1-95.8];P= 0.69) had similar global cognitive function scores (Table2).
At baseline, age (per unit increase: –0.19; 95% CI, –0.23 to –0.14) and dialysis time (per unit increase: –0.18; 95% CI, –0.27 to –0.09) were associated with lower global cognitive function scores.
Compared with non-Hispanic White KTRs, non-Hispanic Black (–3.57; 95% CI, –4.91 to –2.24), Hispanic (–3.74; 95% CI, –6.26 to –1.21), and non-Hispanic Other (–5.67; 95% CI, –8.09 to –3.25) KTRs had lower global cognitive function scores at KT.
KTRs with a college education and more had higher scores at baseline (Table S1, SDC,https://links.lww.com/TXD/A770).

During the first 3 y post-KT, KTRs experienced an improvement in global cognitive function (0.62 points/year; 95% CI, 0.17-1.07) followed by impairment in global cognitive function during 3–8 y post-KT (–1.20 points/year; 95% CI, –2.17 to –0.24).
The trajectories looked similar when assuming a nonlinear association (Figure1).
The trajectories of global cognitive function did not differ by CMV serostatus during the first 3 y post-KT (overallPinteraction= 0.75).
However, after 3 y post-KT, the trajectories of global cognitive function scores differed (overallPinteraction= 0.003).
CMV D+/R+KTRs experienced significant decline in global cognitive function (slope = –3.51 points/year; 95% CI, –5.07 to –1.95) during 3–8 y post-KT, whereas CMV D–/R–(slope = 0.44 points/year; 95% CI, –2.12 to 3.00), CMV D–/R+(slope = 0.13 points/year; 95% CI, –1.83, 2.09), and CMV D+/R- (slope= 0.01 points/year; 95% CI, –1.87 to 1.89) KTRs experienced no significant change in cognitive function over the same time period (Table2).
The results remain constant when excluding KTRs with previous KTs (Table S2, SDC,https://links.lww.com/TXD/A770).
CMV D+/R+KTRs had an estimated 3MS score of 94.0 at 3 y post-KT.
However, by 7 y post-KT, CMV D+/R+KTRs were projected to have cognitive impairment with a lower 3MS score of 79.95.
The minimally important difference in the 3 MS scores, signifying a clinically noticeable difference in cognitive function, was calculated to be –2.8 points/year among CMV D+/R+KTRs.
In contrast, we did not note cognitive impairment among KTRs with other CMV D/R serostatus during 8 y post-KT.
In all, 10.6% of our cohort met the criteria of cognitive impairment during 8 y post-KT.
However, the distribution did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus (P= 0.08).
Similarly, 5.1% of our cohort were diagnosed with dementia, and the distribution did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus (P= 0.14).
3MS scores did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus across all 5 domains at KT.
The 3MS scores remained stable during 8 y post-KT and the trajectories did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus (Table3).

In this prospective cohort study (n = 574), at the time of KT admission, CMV D+/R+KTRs had similar cognitive function scores compared with other recipients regardless of CMV D/R status.
Overall, KTRs experienced an initial improvement in global cognitive function followed by an impairment in cognitive function during years 3–8 post-KT.
The long-term trajectories of global cognitive function scores post-KT (years 3–8) differed by CMV serostatus, with significant cognitive impairment in CMV D+/R+KTRs after 7 y post-KT and no significant changes in CMV D–/R–, CMV D+/R–, and CMV D–/R+KTRs.
This suggests that preexisting CMV infection in KTRs may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment post-KT that is further amplified by CMV infection of the donor.
After restoration of kidney function post-KT, KTRs experience substantial improvement in cognitive function.27However, this benefit is not sustained in some high-risk groups.
In a prior longitudinal study from this study cohort, KTRs experienced initial improvement by 3 mo post-KT in global cognitive function post-KT, and then a plateau out to year 4.27However, among frail KTRs, cognitive impairment was seen between 1 and 4 y post-KT.27Four years post-KT, cognitive scores remained 5.8 points lower in frail KTRs compared with their nonfrail counterparts.
During 8 y post-KT, 10.6% of our cohort met the criteria of cognitive impairment (3MS score of <80) and the distribution did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus (P= 0.08).
Similarly, 5.1% of our cohort had a dementia diagnosis from medical records and the distribution did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus (P= 0.14).
Furthermore, when using a composite outcome of cognitive impairment and ADL/IADL impairment as a surrogate for dementia diagnosis, 4.6% of our cohort were diagnosed with dementia, and the distribution did not differ by CMV D/R serostatus (P= 0.46).
We did not further refer patients with cognitive impairment based on 3MS for cognitive evaluations.
In this study, we found CMV serostatus as a novel and potentially modifiable risk factor for global cognitive function post-KT.
Our study provides granularity by studying cognitive trajectories pre-KT and longitudinally post-KT.
Prior studies exploring the association of CMV and cognitive changes in older adults have shown variable results, in part because of a cross-sectional design with varying characterization of prior CMV infection (by CMV+serostatus, quantitative antibody titers, or both).5,28-33For example, higher CMV IgG antibody titers (a proxy marker of CMV reactivation) have been associated with greater cognitive impairment among older adults5,30and have been associated with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and dementia.5,34In a study focused on cancer survivors, prior CMV infection and high inflammation were also associated with greater cognitive impairment and dementia.32In our study, CMV status was not associated with short-term trajectories.
However, CMV D+/R+KTRs had significantly greater cognitive impairment in the 3–8 y post-KT.
Among CMV R+transplant recipients, the risk of CMV infection is higher when the donor is also CMV R+(CMV D+/R+), compared with when they are a CMV R–donor (CMV D–/R+).35This higher risk of CMV infection is likely due to superinfection from donor-transmitted CMV virus.36-38We believe the greater burden of CMV infection and subsequent inflammation is the likely reason that we are seeing a difference in the cognitive outcomes 3–8 y post-KT between the CMV D+/R+and CMV D–/R+KTRs.
Post-KT, CMV+KTRs are at risk of early and frequent CMV reactivations8and are typically maintained on prophylactic medication to suppress the reactivation of latent CMV infection for 3–6 mo.
However, this strategy increases the incidence of late CMV reactivations.12It is conceivable that the inflammatory response to CMV reactivations may be the link between CMV and impairment of global cognitive function, as supported by the association between CMV and a variety of chronic disorders with an inflammatory component: Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, atherosclerosis, and vascular dementia.6,39,40Our study was not designed to test this hypothesis, and further studies are needed to explore the role of inflammation secondary to CMV reactivations in contributing to cognitive impairment in KTRs.
In addition to inflammation, it is also possible that other factors such as frailty, years on hemodialysis, immune suppressive medications, and a myriad of other posttransplant complications necessitating frequent hospitalizations could be an important driver for cognitive impairment in KTRs.
Our study has several strengths.
Our data come from a large cohort with well-characterized KTRs and high retention (80.9%).
Because African American and older KTRs were overrepresented in our cohort, we were able to investigate the association among these understudied groups.
We collected pre- and post-KT repeated measures of global cognitive function for up to 8 y. Cognitive function was defined using 3MS, a validated screening tool widely used to assess global cognitive function in older adults.15,17The 3MS was the first measure of cognition introduced in the cohort, allowing for up to 8 y of longitudinal measurement of cognition.
Limitations include CMV serostatus information at a single time point.
We did not have qualitative or quantitative data on CMV reactivation post-KT (SRTR does not collect post-KT data on CMV quantitative polymerase chain reactions that are used to measure CMV reactivations).
Thus, we could not capture or infer the magnitude and frequency of CMV reactivations nor identify primary CMV infections post-KT.
However, it is important to note that the incidence of CMV reactivation in D+/R+KTRs has consistently been reported around 40% in the first year posttransplantation, regardless of the approach adopted for prevention of CMV disease.12Although we explored the cross-sectional association between CMV D/R status and cognitive function with multiple cognitive tests, we only had enough longitudinal measurements for 1 screener, which limited our ability to further strengthen the findings.
Further studies with higher sensitivity to relevant domains are warranted.
Other comorbidities that may impact cognitive function include traumatic brain injury and data were not collected for this cohort.
We also did not collect data on substances such as cannabinoids, which may have an impact on cognitive function.
Our findings should be interpreted with caution, as they may be influenced by unmeasured residual confounding.
However, we believe the strongest confounders have been accounted for in our analysis.
A large unmeasured effect would be required to fully negate the observed association, suggesting that our findings are likely robust.
Nevertheless, these associations are hypothesis-generating and warrant further investigation in larger, prospective studies.
In summary, CMV D+/R+KTRs have similar global cognitive function at KT compared with CMV D–/R–, CMV D+/R–, and CMV D–/R+KTRs; however, CMV D+/R+KTRs experience a significant impairment in global cognitive function during 3–8 y post-KT compared with the other groups.
Transplant providers should be aware that CMV D+/R+KTRs may experience cognitive impairment after 3 y post-KT and may benefit from early and regular screening of cognition, evaluation of cognitive changes, including referral to a specialist (neurology and neuropsychology) for thorough evaluation and identification of optimal treatment.
Implementing preventive interventions may help to reduce the risk.
Intact cognitive function is crucial for KTRs to effectively adhere to complex medication regimens and manage outpatient visits and tests.
Nonadherence is a significant risk factor for graft loss and other adverse posttransplant outcomes.
Our study is limited by the lack of data on the incidence and severity of CMV viremia post-KT, which prevents a comprehensive assessment of its impact on clinical outcomes.
Future studies should quantify the impact of active CMV replication and immune responses through quantitative viral load measurements, CMV immune reconstitution assays, and inflammatory markers on global cognitive function trajectories in KTRs.
This may provide additional information on the role of CMV on global cognitive function among KTRs.
Potentially, this could lead to preventive strategies through control of CMV replication with antiviral therapy or immune modulators and may prevent or slow cognitive impairment.
Strategies to prevent initial CMV infection may play a significant role in decreasing neuroinflammatory changes and may help reduce the burden of global cognitive function impairment in KTRs, but this will require the administration of an effective vaccine before infection (most commonly during childhood or adolescence).
