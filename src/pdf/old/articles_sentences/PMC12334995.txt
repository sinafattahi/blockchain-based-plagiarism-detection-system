Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic diseases sharing ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and a high risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The current MDS classification systems, such as the International Consensus Classification (ICC) and the WHO 2022 classification, have incorporated molecular and cytogenetic markers to improve the stratification of risk and guide therapy.
However, treatment options for high-risk MDS (HR-MDS) remain limited, with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) providing only modest survival benefits.
Emerging treatments such as immune checkpoint blockade and novel targeted therapies could further improve patient outcomes.
While early excitement was significant, clinical trials of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ipilimumab and durvalumab have produced no definitive results, highlighting the need for better patient selection and combination regimens.
Emerging drugs luspatercept and imetelstat have been suggested for lower-risk MDS (LR-MDS) by promoting transfusion independence and global hematologic response.
In contrast, exploratory agents such as pevonedistat, magrolimab, and sabatolimab are under further investigation for HR-MDS.
The future of MDS treatment currently addresses precision medicine, in which molecular characterization guides therapeutic options.
Identification of predictive biomarkers for response to targeted therapies and immunotherapies is crucial to optimize patient outcomes.
An integrated, patient-centered approach combining genomics, novel therapeutics, and immunomodulation is therefore essential to address the current needs in MDS management.

This commentary explores the current landscape of MDS, highlighting evolving classification systems, clinical challenges, and novel therapeutic strategies shaping the future of patient care (Figure 1).
The evolution of response criteria in MDS reflects a growing understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology, progressing from basic hematologic measures to more sophisticated molecular and genetic assessments.
Early response evaluations primarily relied on clinical indicators such as peripheral blood counts and transfusion dependency.13These initial criteria, focused on hemoglobin, neutrophil, and platelet levels, provided limited insight into the biological complexity and long-term prognosis of MDS.
Limitations of the IWG criteria became particularly evident in high-risk MDS, where response measures sometimes overestimated therapeutic efficacy.
The 2006 introduction of the “morphologic complete remission” (mCR) concept inadvertently led to misinterpretations of drug activity.
To address these challenges, an international consortium proposed updated response criteria, now known as the IWG 2020 criteria.1These updates included the elimination of unstable mCR definitions, a redefinition of complete remission with a lower hemoglobin threshold, and the introduction of intermediate categories for less-than-complete responses.
These criteria are currently undergoing validation in clinical trials.
The increasing use of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring through next-generation sequencing (NGS) and flow cytometry has further enhanced response assessments.
These technologies allow detection of molecular disease persistence that may not be reflected in peripheral counts, offering deeper insight into treatment efficacy and disease biology.14This shift is especially relevant with the emergence of novel agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, which may achieve durable molecular remissions without immediate hematologic improvements.
Recent large-scale studies have elucidated the dual role of somatic mutations in MDS, not only as markers of disease prognosis but also as predictors of therapeutic response.
TP53 mutations, especially biallelic (“multi-hit”) events and high variant allele frequency (VAF), represent the most adverse molecular biomarker in MDS.
A pivotal analysis of over 7,000 MDS patients revealed that multi-hit TP53 mutations conferred a hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 3.7 for overall survival (OS) compared to monoallelic TP53 mutations (median OS: 8.7 versus 2.5 years; HR = 3.7; 95% CI: 2.7–5.0; p < 0.001).17Moreover, TP53 mutations are strongly associated with complex karyotypes, primary resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs), poor responses to chemotherapy, and rapid disease progression.18,19These findings support the growing consensus that TP53 status, particularly its allelic state and clonal burden, should be used to stratify patients in clinical trials and guide therapeutic choices.
Additional emerging biomarkers under investigation include SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations, both spliceosome gene alterations that may predict resistance to HMA monotherapy and have been linked to clonal persistence after therapy.
High VAFs in these genes often correlate with subclonal stability, suggesting limited responsiveness to single-agent treatments but potential vulnerability to splicing modulators or combination regimens.26Incorporating these mutational markers into dynamic risk models such as IPSS-M has already improved stratification and individualization of therapy.
Moreover, the advent of real-time NGS and MRD tracking is beginning to enable clinicians to adjust therapy based on evolving molecular profiles rather than static baseline characteristics.
As a result, the routine inclusion of molecular biomarkers such as TP53, SF3B1, TET2, and spliceosome gene mutations in diagnostic and prognostic algorithms is rapidly becoming standard practice.
These markers not only provide key prognostic information but increasingly determine eligibility for targeted agents (like eprenetapopt for TP53-mutant MDS; luspatercept for SF3B1-mutant MDS) and guide rational therapeutic combinations.
The integration of biomarker-based decision-making represents a cornerstone of precision oncology in MDS.
Recent advancements in the treatment of lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) have significantly improved patient outcomes, bringing renewed hope to a population previously limited to largely supportive care.
Given the heterogeneous nature of LR-MDS—often characterized by anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia—these breakthroughs are particularly impactful, as they target the underlying disease process rather than just mitigating symptoms.
Another promising agent, imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, is under investigation for patients with LR-MDS who have failed prior therapies.
The IMerge phase 3 trial reported that imetelstat led to significant and durable improvements in hemoglobin levels, with a subset of patients achieving long-term RBC TI.29These results suggest that imetelstat could offer a valuable alternative for patients with limited treatment options, particularly those refractory to ESAs.
Collectively, these studies underscore a paradigm shift in the management of LR-MDS, moving from symptomatic treatment to targeted, disease-modifying therapies.
As agents like luspatercept and imetelstat gain traction, they offer not only improved efficacy but also the potential to enhance quality of life and reduce the burden of chronic transfusions.
Ongoing research and real-world data will be critical to further establish their role and optimize their use in clinical practice.
Continued innovation in this space holds the promise of expanding therapeutic horizons for patients with LR-MDS and improving long-term outcomes.
Venetoclax combined with azacitidine is also under investigation for relapsed/refractory MDS, where it has shown encouraging rates of transfusion independence and clinical responses.35The randomized phase 3 VERONA trial is currently underway, comparing azacitidine plus venetoclax versus azacitidine plus placebo, with complete response (CR) and OS as primary endpoints.
Another promising area of exploration involves targeting immune dysregulation, a hallmark of HR-MDS, that involves impaired T-cell, NK-cell, and macrophage function.36These immunologic defects have spurred interest in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); however, the complex immunosuppressive microenvironment of HR-MDS has limited their success compared to solid tumors and other hematologic malignancies.
A multicenter Phase 1/1b trial of ipilimumab in relapsed hematologic malignancies HSCT demonstrated limited efficacy in HR-MDS patients.37In another study evaluating ipilimumab in the HMA-refractory setting, marrow complete response (mCR) was achieved in one patient (3.4%), and prolonged stable disease (≥46 weeks) occurred in seven patients (24%).38Notably, five patients were able to undergo allo-HSCT without excess toxicity.
Responders exhibited higher frequencies of Inducible Co-Stimulator ( ICOS)-expressing T cells, though increased T-cell receptor diversity did not correlate with clinical outcomes.
These findings suggest potential biomarkers for benefit, but underscore the limited efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy.
Further randomized trials combining durvalumab with azacitidine failed to show improvement in overall response rates or progression-free survival.39The lack of clinical activity was not attributable to altered azacitidine exposure, changes in global DNA methylation, or immune toxicity.
The exact cause however remains sketchy, some hypothesis such as compensatory programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) upregulation or insufficient T-cell activation were proposed but not substantiated by trial data, as no significant immune activation was observed in blood or bone marrow, despite PD-1 blockade.
Given the limitations of current therapies, alternative strategies are under exploration.
One such avenue involves entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), supported by preclinical findings (Tae Kon Kim, unpublished) and under clinical investigation.42A 2014 study of vorinostat plus azacitidine demonstrated a 64% overall response rate (ORR) in a phase 1 setting.43In a subsequent phase 2 trial enrolling HR-MDS and AML patients with poor performance status, the ORR was 30%, with 80% surviving beyond 60 days.
Another promising agent is oral rigosertib, which showed a 90% ORR and a 34% CR rate when combined with azacitidine in a 2019 first-line trial involving HMA-naïve HR-MDS patients.44These results compare favorably to historical CR rates (<20%) with azacitidine monotherapy.
Importantly, 30% of patients achieved transfusion independence—a clinically meaningful outcome that merits further validation in a larger, randomized phase 3 trial.
The regimen was also well tolerated, underscoring its potential viability in frail or elderly patient populations.
Given these limitations, novel biologic agents are being actively investigated to target critical pathways involved in MDS pathogenesis.
These failures highlight the need for mechanism-aligned trial design—matching to oncogenic drivers or immune escape pathways, integrating molecular stratification (e.g., TIM-3⁺, TP53 multi-hit), and incorporating dynamic pharmacodynamic biomarkers.
Checkpoint inhibitors have also been evaluated in MDS.
PD-1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, showed some efficacy in newly diagnosed HR-MDS, but their benefit was limited in HMA-refractory settings.72–74PD-L1 inhibition with durvalumab resulted in improved ORR but was constrained by notable toxicity.75These findings suggest that combination strategies may be required to fully realize the potential of checkpoint blockade in HR-MDS.
While numerous agents have failed to achieve their primary endpoints in late-phase trials, ongoing efforts are exploring innovative therapeutic modalities, including kinase inhibitors, immune-based strategies, and adoptive cell therapies aimed at overcoming resistance and improving outcomes.
While significant obstacles remain in HR-MDS treatment, ongoing development of targeted agents, immunotherapies, and cellular strategies continues to offer hope for transformative therapies and improved patient outcomes.
The therapeutic landscape of MDS has evolved significantly over the past decade, yet major challenges persist, particularly in the treatment of HR-MDS with poor prognoses and limited responses to current therapies.
While hypomethylating agents remain the cornerstone of treatment, their transient efficacy highlights the need for more effective and personalized approaches.
The emergence of novel agents including luspatercept and imetelstat have redefined care in lower-risk MDS, while promising novel strategies—including p53 reactivators, CD47 inhibitors, T-cell TIM-3 blockers, and immune checkpoint inhibitors—are reshaping the treatment paradigm in higher-risk disease.
Despite early successes, many investigational agents have failed to demonstrate sustained clinical benefit in late-phase trials, underscoring the complexity of MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms.
However, the emergence of advanced molecular profiling, risk-adapted treatment strategies, and combination approaches has laid the foundation for a more precise and dynamic therapeutic framework.
A major limitation in the current treatment approach lies in the clinical trial design, where molecular heterogeneity is often overlooked.
Many studies continue to apply the same treatment models to biologically diverse patient populations, limiting the potential to identify effective personalized therapies.
Moreover, the absence of dynamic tools such as MRD monitoring prevents timely treatment adaptation and prediction of possible relapses.
As our understanding of the genetic, immunologic, and microenvironmental drivers of MDS continues to deepen, the integration of novel agents—combined with predictive biomarkers and innovative trial designs—will be critical in advancing personalized care.
Future research must focus on real-time molecular testing to guide therapy tailored to patients’ individual risk, and rational combination therapies that target both the primary disease drivers and the tumor microenvironment.
Importance must be given to the development of adaptive clinical trial designs, exploring early intervention strategies in patients with clonal cytopenias, and emphasizing on quality of life outcomes alongside survival metrics.
Ultimately, while challenges remain, the convergence of translational science, clinical innovation and patient-centered research offers renewed hope for achieving durable remissions and improved long-term outcomes in patients with MDS.
