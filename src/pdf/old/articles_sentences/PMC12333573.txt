Paederia foetidaexhibited the hepatoprotective effect against paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary disease in rats via inflammatory and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
Liver is the vital organ of the body that plays a crucial role during the metabolism and elimination and detoxification of toxic substances1.
The liver tissue is commonly affected via drugs and environmental pollutants, since all of the substances increase the burden of the organ and can weaken and damage it, eventually leading to diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis2,3.
Hepatic injury and its related alteration of metabolic function are still major health burden globally.
Unfortunately, available treatment for the hepatic damage are synthetic drugs, but synthetic drugs have limitation and serious side effects.
With the constraints and adverse effects associated with synthetic drugs, there is a burgeoning interest in investigating traditional herbal medicines that possibly have hepatoprotective effects4-6.
The common side effect of paracetamol (acetaminophen), analgesic and antipyretic drugs is the liver toxicity.
Paracetamol undergoes hepatic metabolism to form sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are then excreted from the body2.
Paracetamol induces hepatotoxicity primarily through the formation of its reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which leads to glutathione depletion and oxidative stress within the tissue7.
Paracetamol induces hepatic toxicity by generating toxic metabolites during its metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes.
NAPQI, one of these metabolites, forms covalent bonds with cysteine groups on proteins, resulting in the formation of 2-(cysteine-S-yl) acetaminophen adducts7,8.
Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity requires the introduction of cytochrome or the depletion of hepatic glutathione7,9.
Despite enormous advancements in modern medicine, various treatment available for the cure of liver dysfunction is inadequate, and various herbal extracts contain formulation used for the regeneration of hepatic cells and also for the treatment of liver against the damage7,9.
Hepatobiliary diseases encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholestasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
These disorders are characterized by chronic inflammation, which plays a central role in liver injury, fibrosis, and progression to end-stage liver disease10,11.
The complex interplay between various cellular and molecular mechanisms contributes to the pathogenesis of these conditions, making them challenging to treat and manage effectively.
The inflammatory process in hepatobiliary diseases involves key mediators such as cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α-TNF-α, interleukin-IL-6, and IL-1β), chemokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which initiate and perpetuate liver damage.
These pro-inflammatory factors are produced by various cell types, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and infiltrating immune cells11-13.
The sustained release of these mediators leads to a chronic state of inflammation, which can persist for years or even decades, gradually eroding liver function and structure.
This chronic inflammation leads to hepatocyte injury, activation of Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), and stimulation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are major drivers of liver fibrosis.
Hepatocyte injury triggers a cascade of events, including the release of damage-associated molecular patterns that further amplify the inflammatory response.
Activated Kupffer cells secrete additional pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, recruiting more immune cells to the site of injury.
HSCs, when activated, transform into myofibroblast-like cells that produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to the accumulation of fibrous tissue and the development of liver fibrosis14,15.
The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway emerges as a critical regulator of the cellular antioxidant response in hepatobiliary diseases.
This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage.
Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
Under oxidative stress conditions, Nrf2 dissociates from its inhibitor Keap1, translocates to the nucleus, and activates the expression of various antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).
This process occurs through the binding of Nrf2 to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of its target genes.
The activation of the Nrf2 pathway represents a crucial adaptive mechanism that allows cells to cope with oxidative and electrophilic stress, which are common features of hepatobiliary diseases15,16.
The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway plays a dual role in the liver by both reducing oxidative stress and modulating inflammatory responses.
Nrf2 activation downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and inhibits the activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor involved in the inflammatory response.
This anti-inflammatory effect is mediated, in part, by the induction of HO-1, which catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron.
These byproducts, particularly carbon monoxide and biliverdin (which is rapidly converted to bilirubin), possess potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Additionally, by upregulating HO-1 and other antioxidant genes, Nrf2 reduces ROS levels, limiting oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation in liver cells.
The antioxidant enzymes induced by Nrf2, such as glutathione S-transferases, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase, work in concert to neutralize ROS and other toxic metabolites.
This coordinated antioxidant response helps maintain the redox balance within hepatocytes and other liver cells, preventing oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and death14-16.

The powdered leaves were extracted with methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 hours at 80°C.
After the extraction process was completed, the solvent was completely removed from the extract sample.
The removal of water from the extract was achieved through freeze drying, resulting in an extract sample with a yield of 24.5% (w/w).
The extract was subsequently stored in a refrigerator, and the desired quantity was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water before being used in the current experimental study.
For the current experimental study, Wistar albino rats of both sexes weighing between 200-220 g were utilized.

The dose selection was used on the previous reported method18,21,22.
At the end of the experimental protocol, the rats were anesthetized using ether anesthesia.
Blood samples were collected by puncturing the retro-orbital plexus and collecting the blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes.
Following blood collection, all rats in each group were euthanized via cervical dislocation.
Hepatic tissue was then removed and divided into two portions.
One portion was stored at -80°C for the estimation of biochemical parameters, while the other portion was used for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) investigation.
Hepatic parameters such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, and albumin; and renal parameters viz., urea, uric acid, and creatinine were estimated using the enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kits following the manufacture instruction (Biosystem S.A., Spain).

Total RNA from tissues was isolated using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The quantity and purity of the RNA were assessed spectrophotometrically (e.g., NanoDrop), measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm.
Reverse transcription was performed using the high-capacity cDNA Reverse transcription kit with 1 µg of total RNA as input.
The reaction mix (20 µL end value reaction) usually included: 1 µg of RNA, 1× reverse transcription buffer, dNTP mix (1 mM each), Random primers or oligo(dT), reverse transcriptase enzyme, RNase inhibitor and the following reverse transcription thermal cycling conditions were applied: 25°C for 10 min, 37-42°C for 60 min and 85°C for 5 min to stop the reaction, respectively.
The cDNA was then used as template for PCR amplification with the gene specific primers.
A typical PCR set up (25-50 µL volume) contained: 1-2 µL of cDNA template, 1×PCR buffer, dNTPs (200 µM each), forward and reverse primers (0.2-0.5 µM each), Taq DNA polymerase (0.5-1.0 units), MgCl2 (1.5-2.5 mM).

Louis, United States of America) was utilized for statistical analysis.
All data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean, andp< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Paracetamol-induced liver injury serves as a model for assessing the hepatoprotective effects of drugs, as it is characterized by xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity23.
It is well documented that hepatic tissue is considered as the significant tissue among the other organs in the body.
Hepatic tissue provides the various physiological functions in the body such as excretory and secretory function, protein synthesis, homeostasis maintenance, and finally storage of nutrients24,25.
Hepatic tissue also protects the body from the side effect of various drugs and xenobiotic.
Previous studies suggested that the chemical solvent that induces the hepatic injury like to that produced it via viral hepatitis26,27.
As per our best knowledge, this is the first time hepatoprotective effect ofP.
were performed against paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary disease in rats.
In this study, silymarin was utilized as the positive control, despite potential differences in its underlying mechanism of action compared to the test compounds.
Silymarin is a polyphenolic flavonoid derived from the seeds and fruits ofSilybum marianum28.
Previous studies show that silymarin and S. marianum extract demonstrate the hepatoprotective effect via antioxidant mechanism29.
The hepatic tissue receives the paracetamol (foreign toxin), which turns into the two free radicals.
These free radicals induce the oxidation or production of unsaturated lipids.
The oxidation of unsaturated lipids starts the induction of hepatic affections30.
Moreover, various compounds are showed the beneficial effect against the hepatic dysfunction induced by paracetamol, via applying their protective effect either via antioxidant potential or attenuation of paracetamol-derived free radical production31,32.
We found that the paracetamol induces the significant alteration in the status of oxidant/antioxidant, which was categorized via considerable boost the level of LPO in the hepatic tissue and marked reduction of hepatic GPx, GSH, SOD, and GST activities.
These finding are in accordance with the previous investigation and confirm the hepatoprotective effect ofP.
Previous investigation suggest that the antioxidants prevent the free radical generation, ROS formation and oxidative stress induced liver toxicity via scavenging the free radicals and ROS33,34.
Flavonoids play an important role in the scavenge the free radicals and antioxidant in biological systems35.
Previous investigations suggested that the flavonoids have various pharmacological effects such as antibacterial, anti-diabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and anticancer effects36,37.Paederia foetidaL.
is a rich source of the flavonoisd.
In the current experimental study, we investigated the hepatoprotective effect ofP.
against paracetamol-induced liver injury.
Paracetamol provoked the liver injury in the rats, and hepatic injury was scrutinized via assessing the activities of hepatic parameters such as ALP, ALT, and AST (hepatic maker)38,39.
The paracetamol treatment increased the level of hepatic parameters in the circulation due to leakage from the hepatic tissue.
The elevated levels of AST are typically accompanied by an increase in the levels of ALT.
ALT plays a crucial role in the conversion of amino acids to keto acids32,38,40.Paederia foetidaL.
treatment considerably attenuated the boosted level of serum hepatic markers.
The result suggested thatP.
extract protect the hepatocytes and integrity of membrane from paracetamol-induced leakage into the serum marker into the circulation.
These alterations can be interpreted as functional improvements in hepatocytes and may be induced by the accelerated regeneration of parenchymal cells.
Studies suggested that the increase level of bilirubin and ALP are responsible for damaging the hepatic cell.
The level of ALP boosted in the serum due to rise the synthesis in the presence of enhancing biliary pressure41.
In this study, we have found thatP.
treatment suppressed the level of bilirubin and ALP due to its antioxidant nature, which may protect the hepatic cell from the injury induced via paracetamol.
The reduction in the albumin in the serum is a hallmark of hepatic diseases42.
Reports suggested that a decrease in serum albumin levels is associated with an increase in the levels of beta and gamma globulins due to the production of IgM and IgG.
Additionally, elevated levels of bilirubin in the serum indicate impaired liver tissue function in storing bilirubin42,43.
Liver parenchymal cells transport bilirubin, in which it undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid facilitated by the enzyme glucuronyl-transferase.
This conjugated bilirubin is then excreted into bile through the process of glucuronidation44,45.
Hepatic parenchymal cells injury leads to boost the level of bilirubin in the serum in paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary in the rats, andPFtreatment altered the level of bilirubin and albumin in the serum suggesting the protective effect against hepatobiliary.
NF-κB is well recognized for its pivotal role in regulating the expression of various genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2.
These genes are implicated in inflammation, tumorigenesis, and autoimmune diseases.
Specifically, TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is instrumental in the inflammatory response and can exacerbate hepatocyte injury and apoptosis in paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity30,46.
IL-1β is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that is implicated in the inflammatory cascade following paracetamol overdose.
It can exacerbate liver injury by promoting inflammation and cell death31.
IL-2 is primarily involved in regulating immune responses.
While its specific role in paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary injury is not well-defined, it may contribute to the overall inflammatory response.
IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in inflammation and immune regulation.
It is known to increase in response to paracetamol overdose and may contribute to hepatocyte injury and inflammation.
IL-7 is important for T-cell development and function47.
Its role in paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary injury is not extensively studied, but it may modulate immune responses during liver injury.
IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can limit the inflammatory response and protect against tissue damage.
Its elevation in paracetamol overdose may represent a compensatory mechanism to counteract excessive inflammation.
IL-17 is associated with inflammatory responses and tissue damage in various diseases.
Its role in paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary injury is not fully elucidated but may contribute to inflammation and liver injury47,48.
IL-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can amplify the immune response.
Its involvement in paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity is implicated in promoting inflammation and hepatocyte injury.
Paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary rats exhibited the altered level of cytokines, andPFtreated group rats restored the level of cytokines.
Both Nrf2 and HO-1 are integral components of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress and inflammation49.
Nrf2 and HO-1 play essential roles in protecting against paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary injury by activating antioxidant and cytoprotective pathways, reducing oxidative stress, and inflammation.
Altering the activity of Nrf2 and HO-1 may represent potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating liver damage associated with paracetamol overdose50.
Nrf2 serves as a transcription factor that modulates the expression of genes involved in antioxidant defense and cellular protection in response to oxidative stress.
In the context of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity, activation of Nrf2 is crucial for safeguarding the liver against injury51.
Upon activation, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus in which it binds to AREs within the promoter regions of target genes.
This includes genes such as HO-1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and GSTs.
The binding of Nrf2 to AREs leads to the upregulation of these antioxidant enzymes and phase-II detoxification enzymes.
Consequently, these enzymes play a crucial role in neutralizing ROS and detoxifying harmful metabolites generated during paracetamol metabolism52.
HO-1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron.
Biliverdin is then converted into bilirubin, which possesses antioxidant properties.
Additionally, CO exerts cytoprotective effects.
HO-1 is induced by various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, and its upregulation serves as a crucial adaptive response to paracetamol-induced hepatobiliary injury49.
The degradation of heme by HO-1, resulting in the production of biliverdin and CO, contributes to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects.
These mechanisms collectively help mitigate liver damage induced by paracetamol overdose.
Paederia foetidatreatment significantly suppressed the level of hepatic and non-hepatic parameters with alteration of glucose, lipid, and renal parameters.
It suppressed the level of inflammatory cytokines and parameters and altered the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, Bax, caspase-3, Bcl-2, Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, and NF-κB.Paederia foetidaexhibited the hepatoprotective effect via inflammatory and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
