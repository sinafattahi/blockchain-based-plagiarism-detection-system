In Botswana, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) clinic was established in 2015 to streamline care for all patients with gynecological malignancies including cervical cancer, Botswana’s leading cause of cancer mortality.
Patients presenting at the MDT clinic in Gaborone, Botswana, were prospectively enrolled.
Temporal trends in stage and treatment distributions were assessed using the Cochran‐Armitage χ2test.
Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method.
Between 2015 and 2023, 2345 patients were enrolled.
Mean age was 52.0 years (SD 13.1 years) and 62.9% (n= 1474) were living with HIV.
Annual volume increased 4‐fold by 2023.
Most patients had cervical cancer (74.3%), followed by vulvar (11.9%), endometrial (8.8%), ovarian (3.6%), and vaginal (1.3%) cancers.
Stage distribution was: Stage I 19.2%, Stage II 23.9%, Stage III 31.3%, and Stage IV 9.4%.
Trends toward increased diagnosis of Stage I disease (p< .0018) and decreased diagnosis of Stage II disease (p= .002) were observed in cervical cancer patients over the years of MDT consultation.
Two‐year overall survival for patients with cervical cancer treated between 2015 and 2019 was 67.1% and increased to 75.2% between 2020 and 2024 (p= .002), potentially driven by increased survival of those with Stage II disease (75.7% vs. 84.8%,p= .025).
This coincided with an increase in patients with cervical cancer receiving primary surgery (p< .001) and a decrease in those receiving radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (p< .001) and radiotherapy alone (p< .001).
Gynecological cancer outcomes after MDT clinic establishment significantly improved over time.
Although ongoing efforts to optimize care are still needed, the success of the MDT clinic in Botswana can serve as a model for coordinated multidisciplinary care in other low‐resource settings.
A multidisciplinary team clinic was established in Botswana 2015 to streamline care for all patients with gynecological malignancies.
Over an 8‐year period, more patients received appropriate curative‐intent care and survival outcomes improved, demonstrating a feasible model of coordinated multidisciplinary care for implementation in other low‐resource settings.
Globally, cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality for women, with the burden disproportionately represented in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs).1In Botswana, a sub‐Saharan African country with a population of 2.5 million people, cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the entire population.2This is in part due to the high rate of HIV infection that exceeds 20% of the overall population and is associated with an increased risk of developing human papilloma virus–related malignancies including cervical and vulvar cancers.2Despite expanded cervical cancer screening and childhood human papilloma virus vaccination programs since 2015, the incidence of cervical cancer has not significantly declined over the past decade.
Lagging public awareness of cervical cancer and lack of broad access to preventative and diagnostic services to the largely rural population also remains a significant barriers to early diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer as well as other gynecological malignancies.
Treatment of cervical, vulvar, endometrial, ovarian, and vaginal cancer can include surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, or a combination of modalities depending on stage and treatment intent.
Most patients travel to the capital city of Gaborone to receive cancer treatment at Princess Marina Hospital (PMH), the national public referral hospital.
Surgery and systemic therapy are provided to patients cost‐free under a government‐based insurance scheme provided to all citizens.
Until 2023, a single linear accelerator located at a private hospital in the capital city of Gaborone served the radiotherapy (RT) needs of the entire population of Botswana.
Through a public–private partnership, the costs of RT with concurrent chemotherapy (CRT) are fully covered by the government insurance plan.
Multidisciplinary care teams (MDT) can optimize coordination of care for patients with cancer to improve staging, treatment recommendations, cost‐effectiveness, and, in some cases, clinical outcomes.3,4,5MDT gynecological oncology clinics typically include a medical oncologist, gynecological oncologist, radiation oncologist, nurse coordinator, and ideally a palliative care physician to allow for care along a continuum that involves close physician collaboration.
This approach has become standard in many higher income countries and implementation is growing in LMICs for many disease sites, often incorporating teleconferencing with institutions from high‐income countries.6,7,8,9However, few reports exist in the literature regarding the establishment and outcomes of gynecological cancer MDT clinics despite the pressing need for quality cervical cancer care globally.
In May 2015, a gynecological oncology MDT clinic was established at PMH.
The central aim of this clinic was to improve care coordination for patients with gynecologic malignancies with a particular focus on cervical cancer given it is the most prevalent cancer in the country.
Since inception, the clinic has served not only as an example for other cancer types in Botswana such as breast cancer, but also as an example for other LMIC settings.
Here, the demographics, treatment, and outcomes of cancer patients seen for consultation at MDT from 2015 through 2023 are reported.
Symptomatic patients or those with positive cervical cancer screening typically present to local clinics or hospitals to undergo biopsy.
Pathology is reviewed at the central national pathology laboratory, and after a cancer diagnosis is confirmed, patients are referred to PMH for oncology consultation.
PMH sees almost all patients with gynecological cancer in the country, although there is a small population of patients with very advanced disease or extremely poor performance status who may elect for palliative symptomatic management at their local institution instead of PMH referral.
Additionally, a small number of privately insured patients may bypass the public system in favor of engaging with private healthcare directly and therefore are not captured by our research team housed within PMH.
In 2015, a weekly gynecological malignancy‐specific clinic was established at PMH, as previously described.10The clinic was initially staffed by a general gynecologist, pathologist, palliative care specialist, and radiation oncologist.
A gynecological oncologist joined in 2019, after which a standing rotation in clinic was established for obstetrics and gynecology residents.
A medical oncologist joined in 2020.
Medical students and residents from outside Botswana have opportunities to participate in supervised rotations.
An established group of nurses and research assistants are also present to assist with patient coordination and education as well as Setswana translation if needed.
New referrals from local or district gynecologists or direct presentation to PMH are coordinated by nursing staff; patients are given an appointment date after confirmation of pathological diagnosis.
Clinic staff call patients the day before their appointment to reduce the rate of missed appointments.
New patients present to clinic with their medical records including physician notes, a pathology report confirming cancer diagnosis, and any prior imaging obtained, often a chest x‐ray and abdominal ultrasound.
Patients are then seen by the care team, after which the visit is documented on a streamlined, single‐page paper consultation form that was developed specifically for the clinic.
This form contains sections for medical history, current symptoms, pathology, prior imaging and laboratory results, physical examination, treatment recommendations, and follow‐up plan.
After team discussion, a plan for further diagnostic evaluation or treatment is agreed upon.
Any patient with unknown HIV status, remote negative HIV test, or known HIV infection not currently on antiretroviral treatment is referred to the PMH Infectious Disease clinic for HIV testing and initiation of antiretroviral treatment as indicated.
Patients are counseled on the care plan by the physician and further education is provided by the nursing team with language interpretation as needed.
Logistical coordination of additional imaging appointments, surgical preadmission date, consultation with a treating radiation oncologist at the private hospital, or chemotherapy start date, as well as a follow‐up appointment in MDT after anticipated treatment is complete, are made by the nursing team before the patient’s departure from clinic.
Given the significant limitations of the existing electronic medical record, a password‐protected smartphone application called OP Care was developed and implemented in the MDT clinic in 2018 and allows for secure organization of clinical documents via photographs, tracks future appointments, and sends automatic text reminders to patients for their upcoming appointments.11,12Patients also require government insurance guarantee forms to ensure coverage of the cost of cross‐sectional imaging and chemoradiotherapy or palliative radiotherapy at private institutions; these forms are completed by physicians during consultation and submitted to the Botswana Ministry of Health with a 2‐ to 3‐day turnaround time for approval.
Patients who are not Botswana citizens may be evaluated in the clinic but can face significant financial challenges because there is no mechanism of government sponsorship for noncitizens to cover the high cost of the chemoradiotherapy treatment that is only available at the collaborating private institution where radiation oncology is housed.
At the conclusion of the visit, patients are approached by research assistants for consideration of enrollment into the Botswana Prospective Cancer Cohort, a database established in 2015 to track presentation, treatment, and outcomes of all participants.13Participation in research is generally viewed favorably by patients and historically more than 90% of patients consent to enrollment.
Standard curative‐intent treatment for Stage IA1 cervical cancer included a simple hysterectomy performed by a general gynecologist.
For Stage IA2‐IB1 cervical cancer, patients received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy and simple hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection or chemoradiation.
After 2019, a radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection was performed for Stage IA2‐IIA1 patients by a specialty‐trained gynecological oncologist.
Locally advanced cervical cancer treatment for all other stages consisted of external beam CRT with concurrent cisplatin followed by brachytherapy, with the exception of patients treated during the COVID‐19 pandemic who received induction chemotherapy followed by RT given long RT delays.
Standard curative‐intent treatment of early or locally advanced stage vulvar cancer included vulvectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or RT as indicated.
Treatment for inoperable disease consisted of CRT or chemotherapy followed by additional treatment depending on response.
Standard curative‐intent treatment of uterine‐confined endometrial cancer included simple hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy performed by a general gynecologist or, after 2019, a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy and pelvic and para‐aortic lymph node dissection by a specialty‐trained gynecological oncologist.
Patients received adjuvant chemotherapy or RT as indicated by surgical pathology findings.
Treatment for advanced or inoperable endometrial cancer consisted of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by additional treatment depending on response.
Standard curative‐intent treatment of ovarian cancer consisted of primary debulking with adjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with possible interval debulking.
Standard curative‐intent treatment of vaginal cancer consisted of external beam RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy and brachytherapy.
Patients were prospectively enrolled during the MDT clinic from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023.
Demographic information was collected from patient consult forms.
Residential status was based on population‐level district data.
Patients residing in Francistown District, Gaborone District, Jwaneng Town Council, Selibe‐Phikwe District, and Lobatse District were grouped as urban; the remainder were classified as rural.
Cancer stage was based on FIGO 2009 or 2018 clinical staging.14Imaging consisted of chest x‐ray and abdominal ultrasound at time of initial MDT evaluation.
Cross‐sectional imaging for radiographic staging became eligible for coverage under government insurance for most patients in 2022, although patients typically required referral at the time of consult and subsequent follow‐up visit to review and confirm radiographic stage.
Treatment details were included in the analysis if the index visit occurred within this time.
During the COVID‐19 pandemic, nationwide lockdown was in effect for multiple distinct periods, restricting movement across the country and severely limiting the provision of all health care services.15In this analysis, the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic was considered most pronounced between April 1, 2020, and December 1, 2021.
Descriptive statistics were used to highlight all collected patient and clinical characteristics for the cohort overall and by cancer diagnosis site: age, year of visit, residential status, disease stage, HIV status, marital status, and delay from pathologic diagnosis to MDT consultation, delay from MDT consultation to treatment initiation, and delay from pathologic diagnosis to treatment initiation.
The analysis cohort excluded patients with Stage 0 disease, which included patients with preinvasive disease.
Temporal trends in stage distribution and treatment distribution were evaluated using the Cochran‐Armitage χ2test for trend.
Time intervals in the treatment pathway were assessed using the Mann‐Kendall test for trend.
The following time intervals in the treatment pathway were defined as: days between the date of pathologic diagnosis and MDT consultation, days between the date of pathologic diagnosis and treatment initiation, and days between the date of MDT consultation and treatment initiation.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time in months from the date of MDT consultation to the date of death from any cause.
Patients lost to follow‐up were censored using the most recent follow‐up visit.
Survival by cancer diagnosis site, by disease stage stratified by cancer diagnosis site, and by year of treatment initiation stratified by cancer diagnosis site was estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method, with log‐rank tests used to compare survival among subgroups.
Given the majority of patients presented with cervical cancer, survival was also estimated by disease stage and year of treatment initiation.
Statistical analysis was performed using R 2024 (RStudio Team, Boston, MA) and statistical significance was set at a threshold ofp< .05.
Between January 28, 2015, and December 8, 2023, 2345 patients were enrolled and included in the analysis (Table1).
The annual number of patients enrolled increased 4‐fold from year of clinic establishment to the end of the analysis period, representing 94 patients seen in 2015 and 373 patients seen in 2022 (Table1).
Notably, the COVID‐19 pandemic impacted clinic visits, resulting in a sharp decline in 2019 (n= 301), 2020 (n= 256), and 2021 (n= 221), with visit rebound starting in 2022 (n= 373).
The overall mean age was 52.0 years (SD 13.1 years).
More than half of all patients were living with HIV infection (n= 1474, 62.9%), including a majority of patients with cervical (n= 1165, 66.8%), vulvar (n= 242, 86.4%), and vaginal cancer (n= 22, 71.0%), and a minority of patients with endometrial (n= 23, 11.1%) and ovarian (n= 22, 26.2%) cancer.
Most patients resided in rural areas (n= 1861, 79.4%), with the distance to the treatment facility ranging from 46.5 to 1211 km, whereas 449 (19.1%) resided in urban areas with the distance to the treatment facility ranging from 6 to 437 km.
Most patients were not married (n= 1777, 75.8%).

The MDT clinic serves patients with a variety of gynecological malignancies.
Survival outcomes of patients with cervical, vulvar, endometrial, and ovarian cancers were consistent with prior reports in Botswana, yet remain lower than their counterparts in high‐income countries.1,13,19,20Outcomes for vaginal cancer, a rare entity, have not been previously reported in sub‐Saharan Africa, and these data provide a benchmark for future studies in this disease site.
Cervical cancer leads in both prevalence and death among all patients with cancer in Botswana, and this was evident in the high proportion of patients with cervical cancer seen at MDT clinic.1Since the establishment of the MDT clinic, patients presenting with Stage I cervical cancer have significantly increased, whereas fewer patients present with Stage II disease.
This may reflect several changes in Botswana over time, including earlier presentation to care because of public education campaigns surrounding cancer control plans, larger uptake of screening initiatives and use of mobile screening clinics, greater referral and knowledge regarding the existence of the MDT clinic, use of cross‐sectional imaging for staging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) after 2022 for accurate staging, as well as shorter intervals from pathological diagnosis to MDT consultation.13,18,21,22,23,24The relative stability in the proportion of Stages III and IV patients over time, however, may reflect subsets of patients that have not been reached by these initiatives and still present only when their disease is significantly symptomatic.
Despite the efforts made to reach women across Botswana, many patients live in rural regions with low health literacy and poor access to healthcare.
Continued efforts to reach women across the country are needed to further shift patient stage at presentation.
More accurate staging is critical for improving outcomes across stage groups, as reflected in the updated 2018 FIGO staging for cervical cancer, which included the use of cross‐sectional imaging rather than examination alone, as was standard of care before 2018.
Cross‐sectional imaging by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging was not reliably accessible for all patients in Botswana until 2022, when government insurance began to cover the cost.
Therefore, clinical staging by examination was used as the primary method of staging to determine treatment recommendations.
The new availability of cross‐sectional imaging may influence future analyses of this prospective cohort as cross‐sectional imaging can provide more accurate staging information, resulting in more appropriate treatment recommendations and overall clinical benefit to all groups via the “Will Rogers effect.”25This may have been a contributing factor to the OS improvement seen in patients with Stage II cervical cancer, who may have been more likely to be prescribed appropriate chemoradiation after imaging confirming more advanced disease not appropriate for surgery.
For patients with locally advanced cervical cancer requiring chemoradiation, a significant barrier to timely treatment for public hospital patients was coordination of logistics and paperwork to ensure they could receive treatment at the only radiotherapy center in the country, housed in a private hospital.
This required approval of government guarantees to cover treatment costs, timely first consultation with radiation and medical oncologists at the private hospital after their referral from the MDT clinic, and reliable daily transportation of patients from the private hospital to the public hospital where many of them lodge during their treatment course.
Developing strong interinstitutional relationships to promote efficient care coordination was a vital aspect of streamlining care for these patients.
Additionally, in the first years of establishing the MDT clinic, physicians worked with the central pathology laboratory to coordinate cervical cancer pathology reporting and to reduce delays from diagnosis to the MDT consultation.
Given the high volume of patients, the clinic team aimed for an interval between MDT consult to treatment initiation of at most 90 days and achieved a median interval of 34 days.
Although this interval increased over the years as patient volume increased, only during the COVID‐19 pandemic were 90 days exceeded.
Similar to global trends in cancer care provision during the COVID‐19 pandemic, treatment patterns in Botswana shifted significantly over 2020 and 2021.15,27,28,29Compared to 2019, patient volume decreased by one quarter in 2021.
The inaccessibility of radiotherapy due to quarantine measures resulted in a shift in the treatment paradigm of patients with cervical cancer to induction chemotherapy as a measure to hold patients over until RT could be delivered.
Although this treatment sequencing is not currently a standard of care and was employed under a circumstance of necessity, reassuring outcomes have been reported from this cohort in Botswana as well as results from a large, international randomized clinical trial.30,31Unsurprisingly, the proportion of patients not receiving any treatment increased precipitously in 2020 with a subsequent decrease in 2021.
Future analyses will better define the long‐term impact of the COVID travel restrictions on stage at presentation given the temporary lack of screening or in‐person provision of care that would identify disease at an early stage.
This study has several notable strengths, including an extended longitudinal period of study, a unique cohort with a high rate of HIV infection, and a robust data collection protocol.
It has several notable limitations, specifically the lower representation of gynecological cancers outside of cervical cancer, which limits the ability to draw conclusions from these smaller sample sizes.
While HIV management, including antiretroviral therapy administration and CD4 counts, has been reported in prior studies of the patient population with cervical cancer,26this study cannot report similar statistics with noncervical cancer disease sites, which could assist with future characterization of these populations for those living with HIV infection.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of the establishment of an MDT clinic in Botswana.
This MDT clinic not only aims to improve clinical care, but by incorporating strong prospective research methodologies, has also been able to expand the scope of care delivered and improve the processes needed to accelerate treatment timelines and adhere to treatment recommendations.
As cancer becomes an increasing burden in LMICs, MDT clinics will serve as a valuable tool to address the complexity of care in low‐resource settings.
