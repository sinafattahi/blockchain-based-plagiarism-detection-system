Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a rare hereditary neuropathy that affects peripheral nerves in the upper and lower limbs.
To distinguish between the different forms of the disease, electrophysiological criteria are essential.
Furthermore, identifying the genetic cause is crucial for providing accurate genetic counseling.
The genetic complexity of CMT is partly explained by digenism, where mutations in two distinct genes might contribute to the disease.
Two genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics,MFN2andGDAP1, have been identified in digenic cases of CMT.
This retrospective study reportsMFN2/GDAP1digenism cases identified in patients affected by CMT in our laboratory.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1665 patients who underwent NGS using the CMT gene panel between 2016 and 2024.
These patients affected by CMT were addressed from neurology reference centers in France.
The results were analyzed with bioinformatics tools, initially using the hg19 reference genome and then the hg38 version.
Out of 1665 patients, 367 positive cases were identified, corresponding to a 22% molecular diagnostic rate, excludingPMP22duplications.
Among these, 15 cases involved variants in two distinct genes, resulting in a 4% digenism rate.
Five cases involvedMFN2/GDAP1variants, accounting for 1.4% of the total positive results and 33% of all digenic cases.
The cases of digenism have a significant prevalence in CMT disease and may explain the severity of the phenotype in our patients.
Multilocus variants complicate genetic counseling due to non‐Mendelian inheritance.
In addition, it is important to distinguish between digenism and modifier genes.
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a rare hereditary neuropathy affecting the peripheral nerves in both the upper and lower limbs.
Its prevalence is about 1 in 2500 individuals [1], which can vary between populations, ranging from 1:1250 to 1:10000 [2].
The disease is characterized by muscle atrophy, weakness, and progressive peripheral nerve degeneration.
While most patients exhibit symptoms during childhood, the disease can remain asymptomatic until later stages of life.
Clinically, CMT presents with three characteristic signs: progressive distal motor deficits leading to steppage gait; skeletal deformities such as high‐arched feet and claw toes; and generalized or Achilles tendon‐specific hypo‐ or areflexia.
However, clinical examination alone cannot distinguish between the different forms of CMT, requiring electrophysiological criteria for classification.
CMT is broadly divided into two main types: CMT1 (demyelinating), marked by reduced motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) in the median nerve (< 35 m/s), and CMT2 (axonal), characterized by normal or mildly reduced MNCV (> 45 m/s) but lower amplitude.
An intermediate form also exists, with an MNCV between 35 and 45 m/s [3].
Identifying the genetic cause is essential to confirm the diagnosis and to provide tailored genetic counseling based on the mode of inheritance.
Genetic mutations associated with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) affect genes crucial for the formation and maintenance of peripheral nerves, including Schwann cell and neuronal proteins.
Over 100 genes have been implicated in CMT, withPMP22,MPZ,GJB1,MFN2,GDAP1, andSH3TC2being the most frequently involved.
The large number of associated genes makes CMT a multigenic disorder, contributing to the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in patients.
Phenotypic variability seen within affected individuals, even in the same family, can be partly explained by digenism, wherein pathogenic mutations in two distinct genes jointly contribute to the clinical phenotype.
In these cases, a single mutation is insufficient to cause the disease.
Digenism has been reported for several CMT‐related genes [4], with most coding for proteins involved in similar or complementary biological pathways.
The combination of mutations in two different genes generally results in a more severe phenotype than monogenic cases, suggesting an additive effect.
Identifying cases of digenism is crucial for understanding CMT's pathophysiological mechanisms and improving genetic diagnosis and counseling.
A Chinese study on 189 CMT families estimated the rate of digenism at 2.1% [5], with three families showing an association of pathogenic variants in theMFN2andGDAP1genes, both involved in mitochondrial metabolism.
Among the genes involved in CMT2, theMFN2gene, which encodes mitofusin 2, is implicated in 8%–30% of CMT2 cases [6,7,8].
Mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial transmembrane protein, plays a key role in mitochondrial fusion through its GTPase domain, facilitating the formation of mitofusin 1 and 2 homo‐ and hetero‐oligomers that bind adjacent mitochondrial outer membranes [9,10].
Mutations inMFN2disrupt mitochondrial fusion [10,11,12,13], leading to CMT2A2, a form of the disease which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner.
This form appears early in life with distal muscle atrophy, weakness in all four limbs, and symptoms such as walking difficulties, balance issues, reduced fine motor skills, paresthesia, and optic atrophy.
NumerousMFN2mutations, mostly located in the GTPase domain [14,15], are linked to mitochondrial energy coupling defects [16], although the phenotypic variability remains significant [17] making it difficult to establish a clear correlation between the identified mutation and the patient's symptoms.
GDAP1, another gene involved in mitochondrial metabolism, is associated with CMT development by promoting mitochondrial fission.
Mutations inGDAP1lead to dysfunction in complex I of the respiratory chain [18], which is counterbalanced by mitochondrial fusion proteins like mitofusin 1, mitofusin 2, and Drp1, which maintain mitochondrial integrity [19].
PathogenicGDAP1mutations cause neuropathies [20], including CMT4A which is characterized by early onset and severe demyelinating neuropathy associated with vocal cord paralysis, early and severe scoliosis and cranial nerve involvement, leading to visual and facial movement abnormalities in an autosomal recessive mode of transmission.
CMT2K, linked toGDAP1, manifests later in life with milder phenotype of axonal neuropathy and slower progression.
This retrospective study reportsMFN2/GDAP1digenism cases identified in patients with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease at our laboratory at the Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.
We conducted a retrospective study on 1665 patients who underwent NGS sequencing using the CMT gene panel from 2016 to 2024.
This panel was performed on patients with motor and sensory neuropathy from neurology reference centers in France.
Patient DNA was extracted from venous blood samples using magnetic bead technology to isolate DNA from leukocytes.
The DNA was prepared and stored by the Biological Resources Center of the Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille (CRB‐APHM, certified ISO 20387 & ISO 9001 v2015).
The samples were obtained after written consent from the patient according to the collection declared to the French Ministry of Education, Research, and Innovation (declaration number DC‐2008‐429), whose use for research purposes was authorized (authorization number AC‐2023‐5572).
Mutations in this study were identified in index cases using next‐generation sequencing (NGS) with an IonProton sequencer.
Our laboratory uses gene panels implicated in CMT in cases of clinical suspicion, initially comprising 82 genes, later expanded to 151 genes from the FILNEMUS network.
NGS analyses are considered satisfactory when more than 90% of transcripts are covered 100% with a depth of 20X.
In cases of likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants, NGS results are confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
Amplification is performed using a ThermoFisher thermocycler, and Sanger sequencing is carried out with an ABI3500XLS sequencer.
Data are then analyzed with Sequencher software version 4.8.
Results are analyzed using bioinformatics tools, initially with the hg19 version and then hg38 of the reference genome.
All variants were filtered using general population databases from gnomAD v4.1.0 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and DGV (https://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home), and their description on different databases like OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Decipher (https://www.deciphergenomics.org/), and UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/).
Variants are described according to the HGVS nomenclature and are classified according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) [21].
The common symptoms observed among the families described in our study include motor and sensory manifestations, which vary in severity and localization.
Our patients are of European origin.
The index cases from families 1, 2, and 3 presented with lower limb involvement.
In contrast, the index cases from family 5 exhibited involvements of all four limbs.
The index case from family 4 was the only one with predominantly upper limb involvement.
A recurring symptom is distal motor deficit, often associated with mild to severe atrophy of the lower limbs.
Additionally, foot drop and deformities such as varus feet or flat feet are frequently noted, suggesting weakness in the foot‐lifting muscles (Table1).
Sensory signs, such as distal hypoesthesia to temperature and pain, as well as apallesthesia, are present in some families, indicating damage to sensory nerve fibers.
Tendon reflexes can be moderately to severely affected, varying from family to family, with some families presenting associated hypoesthesia (Table1).
Clinical features of the five index cases in this study.
Abbreviations: MCV, motor conduction velocity; ROT, osteotendinous reflex; SCV, sensory conduction velocity.
Family 1: The index case is a 28 years old woman with severe sensory‐motor axonal CMT with a marked motor predominance.
Symptoms began as soon as walking was acquired, around 1 year of age, with frequent falls and clubfoot.
The father of the index case has Thomsen's disease, and her mother is asymptomatic (Figure2).
Family 2: The index case is a 7 years old child presenting with sensory‐motor neuropathy.
On clinical examination, mild muscle atrophy is noted in the upper limbs.
In the lower limbs, there are clubfoot and a deficit in the foot‐lifting muscles.
The parents are asymptomatic and have normal ENMG (Figure1).

Family 3: The index case is a 69 years old woman with length‐dependent sensory‐motor axonal neuropathy with sensory predominance.
Symptoms began in adulthood.
The patient's history includes autoimmune phenotype such as rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, vascular leukoencephalopathy, and an undiagnosed degenerative familial arthropathy.
There is no history of neuropathy in her relatives (Figure1).
Family 4: The index case is a 46 years old woman with slowly progressive sensory‐motor axonal neuropathy.
Symptoms began at the age of 12.
The mother and half‐sister of the index case also have neuropathy, which began in childhood with quadri‐distal muscle atrophy predominantly in the lower limbs (Figure1).
Family 5: The index case is a 36 years old woman with motor neuropathy affecting all four limbs with very slow progression.
Symptoms began in childhood with difficulty running.
The mother of the index case has the same phenotype but with a much milder phenotype (Figure1).
From the data of 1665 patients, we obtained 367 positive results, representing a 22% molecular diagnostic success rate, excluding thePMP22gene duplication, which is performed beforehand.
In the same period we identified 650 patients carrierPMP22duplication, representing 39% of established molecular diagnosis.
Among the positive results, we identified 15 cases where variants were present in two distinct genes.
The digenism rate in our laboratory is thus 4%, including five cases of digenism involving theMFN2/GDAP1genes.
Therefore, we report a 1.4% digenism rate forMFN2/GDAP1relative to the total number of positive results, and 33% when considering only digenism cases.
Associated variants in theMFN2andGDAP1genes were found in heterozygous states in the five families described (Figure1).
In Family 1, the index case carried theMFN2: c.311G>A inherited from the asymptomatic mother andGDAP1: c.400del inherited from the asymptomatic father.
In Family 2, the index case carried theMFN2: c.707C>T inherited from the asymptomatic father andGDAP1: c.473C>T mutations inherited from the asymptomatic mother.
Family investigations indicated independent segregation of the variants.
In Family 3, the index case carried theMFN2: c.1101G>C andGDAP1: c.619A>G mutations.
Although genetic testing of the family was not possible, neither parent exhibited signs of neuropathy.
In Family 4, the index case was found to carry theMFN2: c.754A>G andGDAP1: c.715C>T mutations.
In Family 5, the index case presented with a heterozygous deletion involving exons 1–11 of theMFN2gene and theGDAP1: c.458C>A mutation.
In both Family 4 and Family 5, the mothers of the index cases were affected by neuropathy, but genetic testing could not be conducted.
All variants in theMFN2gene are located within or near the functional GTPase domain (Figure2).
In theGDAP1gene, two variants (p.Pro153Gln and p.Thr158Ile) are located at the α4–α5 double helix, while two others (p.Lys207Glu and p.Lys239Phe) are found within or near the glutathione‐S transferase C domain (Figure2).
The fifth variant (p.Asp134MetfsTer13) is located just after the glutathione‐S transferase N domain, but it causes a frameshift, suggesting the lack of expression of the rest of the protein, including the functional glutathione‐S transferase N domain, the transmembrane domain, and a hydrophobic domain (Figure2).
All variants were either absent or present at very low frequencies (< 0.001%) in GnomAD.
Two variants inMFN2(c.311G>A and c.707C>T) and three variants inGDAP1(c.400del; c.473C>T and c.715C>T) have been described in publications on PubMed as pathogenic variants (Table2).
In theMFN2gene, the mutation identified in Family 1,MFN2: c.311G>A, has been previously reported in a compound heterozygous state, in combination with theMFN2: c.239G>T mutation [22].
In Family 2, theMFN2: c.707C>T mutation has been documented both in a heterozygous state without additional variants and in association with aGDAP1variant (GDAP1: c.368A>G).
Notably, only theMFN2variant from Family 2 has been reported in digenic inheritance involving aGDAP1variant [24].
Both variants were inherited independently from asymptomatic parents.
In Families 4 and 5, theGDAP1variants described in our study have already been reported in the literature, either in a homozygous state [35,36,37] or in a compound heterozygous state, associated with another heterozygousGDAP1mutation [37,38,39,40,41,42].
These studies suggestGDAP1haploinsufficiency, supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
These results are described in Table3.
According to ClinVar, literatures and ACMG classification, all variants were categorized as pathogenic (class V) or likely pathogenic (class IV), except for the variants in family 3, which were classified as of uncertain significance (class III).
TheGDAP1variants, c.400delG and c.473C>T, were absent from ClinVar.
The classification of variants is summarized in Table2.

In recent years, new sequencing technologies have enriched the panel of genes implicated in CMT.
New genes are being described as responsible for the disease, with all possible modes of inheritance.
In previous studies,PMP22duplication accounted for 48.8%–63.2% of all CMT disease subtypes [45,46,47]; our result is 39%, which is lower than expected.
This could be explained by a less stringent phenotype of suspected CMT patients.
CMT is a monogenic disease, but cases of digenism have been described.
The first case of digenism was reported in 2005 with mutations in theEGR2andGJB1genes [35], both involved in Schwann cell development and peripheral nerve myelination.
The prevalence of co‐inherited variants was estimated at 0.5% in a study of 1005 patients in Japan in 2019 [4].
The five digenism cases reported by this study involved five different associations:SETX/ARHGEF10,SH3TC2/SACS,LRSAM1/MARS,HARS/ARHGEF10,MFN2/PMP22.
More recently, a Chinese study of 189 patients with CMT estimated the digenism rate at 2%, with one case involving theMPZ/PMP22genes and three cases involvingMFN2/GDAP1[5].
Our study included a larger number of patients than the two previous studies (1665 patients) and we identified a prevalence of co‐inherited variant of 0.9% compared to the total number of patients.
This number increases to 4% if we consider only positive cases, 33% of which are linked toMFN2/GDAP1digenesis.
The association of these two genes is therefore significant in digenism cases.
In the literature, 11 cases of co‐inherited variants in theMFN2/GDAP1genes have been reported [5,24,36,37,38,39,40,41,42], but only four have been confirmed through family studies [36,37,39,42].
A literature review ofMFN2/GDAP1digenism cases is described in Table4.
In our study, we described two cases of confirmed digenism through family genetic studies (families 1 and 2).
The index cases presented with severe symptoms from childhood.
Their parents carried mutations in only one of the two genes and did not exhibit neuropathy.
In family 3, the parents could not undergo genetic analysis.
However, it is worth noting that they did not show neuropathy, suggesting a case of digenism with a transmission pattern like families 1 and 2.
The digenism model could also apply to families 4 and 5, despite the lack of genetic information for their relatives.
The presence of symptoms in the relatives of these last two families can be explained by a non‐Mendelian transmission pattern.
One parent carries both mutations, and in a multilocus inheritance mode, they could potentially transmit both mutations to their offspring.
The presence of symptoms in relatives of families 4 and 5 can also be explained by the hypothesis of a modifier gene.
This hypothesis was proposed when mutations inMFN2/GDAP1were associated [5].
The authors suggest that theMFN2gene mutation is responsible for the disease, and the presence of a mutation in theGDAP1gene worsens the phenotype.GDAP1would then act as a modifier gene, exacerbating the phenotype [5].
In his study, Xie et al. report twoMFN2/GDAP1mutation combinations (MFN2: c.613_622del/GDAP1: c.713G>T andMFN2: c.839G>A/GDAP1: c.3G>T), both inherited in a heterozygous state from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic parents.
Specifically, in the case of the mutation c.613_622del, the carrier mother exhibited only pes cavus.
Additionally, the authors describe a thirdMFN2/GDAP1combination (MFN2: c.1835C>T/GDAP1: c.767A>G), where theGDAP1mutation was inherited from the asymptomatic father, while theMFN2mutation occurred de novo.
Mutations in theGDAP1gene exert a loss of function mechanism and increase mitochondrial damage caused byMFN2gene mutations, which could explain the exacerbation of the CMT2A phenotype [5].
In family 3, both variants were classified as of uncertain significance.
The family study was not carried out, and the heredity was therefore not evaluated.
This case is complex and requires further functional studies to confirm digenism.
To differentiate between cases of digenism and those involving a modifier gene, it is important to recognize thatMFN2andGDAP1have been implicated in CMT with both autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance patterns.
When a mutation inMFN2is associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, the hypothesis thatGDAP1functions as a modifier gene is typically favored.
On the other hand, when bothGDAP1andMFN2mutations are inherited recessively, the digenic hypothesis becomes more plausible.
In our study, only theMFN2: c.707C>T mutation had been previously described by Calvo et al. [25] as causing CMT in a heterozygous state.
However, a more recent study by Kostera‐Pruszczyk et al. [24] classified this same mutation as haploinsufficient, where the presence of a secondGDAP1mutation (GDAP1: c.368A>G) was necessary for CMT development.
As CMT gene panels have expanded, new variant combinations, previously unanticipated, have been identified.
In our study, all the mutations documented in the literature have been classified as haploinsufficient, which supports the presence of digenism in all cases we analyzed.
However, we describe family 5 which carry theMFN2deletion, a probable loss of function mechanism which is either severe than family describe carrying missense mutation in theMFN2gene (Family 1,2, 3, and 4) associated with a missenseGDAP1.
It is important to note that, in a co‐inherited variant, extended family investigations and functional studies are needed to determine whether this is indeed a case of digenism or a modifier gene.
Functional studies directly on nerve tissue are challenging due to the invasive nature of the sampling required.
A possible alternative could be the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS).
However, these studies are time‐consuming and remain within the realm of research.
New high‐throughput sequencing technologies allow us to identify variants in numerous genes, enabling the identification of digenism cases.
Identifying co‐inherited variants is particularly important as they represent 4% of our positive results.
In our study, the co‐occurrence ofMFN2andGDAP1mutations results in an earlier disease onset and a more severe clinical phenotype compared to isolated cases.
Furthermore, our study suggests digenism could help explain some of the clinical heterogeneity found in CMT.
In addition to clinical heterogeneity, multilocus variations generate more severe phenotypes compared to those usually seen in monogenic cases.
These cases complicate genetic counseling because the transmission pattern does not follow Mendelian inheritance, making it difficult to predict the risk of offspring inheriting both mutations, thereby complicating prenatal diagnosis.
