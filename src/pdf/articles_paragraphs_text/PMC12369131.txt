Previous research has delved into the influence of implicit theories, such as those concerning personality and morality on the breach of trust. Yet, the findings have been inconsistent. This variability might stem from the limited relevance of the domains that implicit theories encompass in the context of trust. To address this, the study explores the role of the implicit theories of trust specifically within the trust domain and their effects on trustworthiness. Through this, we aim to elucidate the domain generality and specificity of implicit theories of trust.

To elucidate the domain generality and specificity of implicit theories of trust, the study juxtaposes them with implicit theories of personality as a comparative framework from a distinct domain. Two complementary studies were conducted to explore the structure of implicit theories of trust and their influence on trust in 2023. Study 1 utilized a correlational approach to assess the association between implicit theories of trust and interpersonal trust. Study 2 used a causal examination to uncover the specific effects of these theories on trust.

The results of both studies revealed two dimensions of implicit theories of trust: entity theory, which posits trust as a fixed and unchangeable trait, and incremental theory, which regards trust as a malleable and adaptable quality. This is the same as the implicit view of personality, which reflects the generality of the domain. Notably, the two types of implicit theories exert distinct effects on trust. Individuals holding an entity theory of trust tend to exhibit a stronger propensity to trust others. Whereas those adhering to an incremental theory of personality display a greater readiness to trust. This finding underscores the domain specificity of the implicit theories of trust.

The study, consistent with previous research on implicit theories, categorized implicit theories of trust into entity theorists and incremental theories. It revealed that implicit theories of trust exert differential effects on perceived individual trustworthiness when compared to implicit theories of personality. This novel finding provides a new perspective for understanding the psychological mechanisms that underlie the construction of trust. It enhances our understanding of the psychological foundations of trust formation in interpersonal interactions.

Trust holds a central position in both societal and individual dynamics [4,38]. At a societal level, trust is instrumental in maintaining social cohesion and driving economic prosperity [13]. At the individual level, trust fosters psychological well-being and personal growth [6,23,31],. However, when trust is violated, its positive effects vanish, and the consequences can be severe. Violations lead to economic, emotional, and social burdens for the affected party [47], sometimes prompting retaliatory actions [50]. Consequently, a substantial body of research has focused on “restoring broken trust” [25,43], which encompasses various strategies such as verbal apologies and explanations [2], as well as tangible actions like financial compensation and regulatory intervention [29].

However, trust repair is a collaborative process. The Bilateral Model of Trust Repair suggests that this process is bidirectional, with the trust violator initiating reparative actions and the victim assessing these efforts, ultimately deciding whether to accept or reject them [26]. Schweitzer et al. [40] noted that some individuals may refuse to restore trust after a breach. The repair of trust depends not only on the violator’s active efforts to mend but also on the victim’s willingness to engage in the repair process. However, individuals may hold different views on whether to trust the violators again. Some may think that the violators will act the same way and betray again; Others believe that violators will change their behavior and not make the same mistakes. Formed in interpersonal interactions, implicit theories (often referred to as “mindset” in current research) encompass these perspectives, which are an individual’s underlying assumptions regarding whether human characteristics (such as intelligence, personality, etc.) are fixed or changeable [14,30].

Implicit theories, as extensively researched by Dweck in the field of learning, refer to beliefs about the fixed or malleable attributes of human beings (e.g., intelligence, personality, etc.), gradually formed in the process of interpersonal communication [14,30]. These theories can be divided into entity theory and incremental theory. Entity theorists tend to attribute behavior to abstract, generalized, and static internal traits, suggesting that these traits are determinants of individual actions [51]. Incremental theories believe that a person’s characteristics are malleable and dynamic, and individuals can change their characteristics and the surrounding environment [36], focusing more on the influence of environmental and psychological factors on individual behavior [22]. While implicit theories have been well-documented in psychology since Dweck’s pioneering work, research on their impact on trust remains scarce. Relevant studies have focused on trust repair and explored the relationship between implicit theories and trust, but the research findings are inconsistent.

Haselhuhn et al. [18] explored the impact of implicit theories regarding moral character on the process of trust repair. Their findings indicated that individuals with incremental theories experienced more effective trust repair compared to those with entity theories. Jiang [24], employing similar theoretical frameworks, also found that incremental theorists showed more robust trust repair than entity theorists. In contrast, Yao et al. [48], while examining the link between implicit personality theories and trust repair, observed no significant difference in the effectiveness of trust repair between entity and incremental theorists. Likewise, Kim and Song [27], in their study of implicit theories about artificial intelligence and the trust repair of intelligent agents, found no significant difference in trust repair effectiveness between the two groups. We hypothesize that these inconsistent findings may stem from variations in the implicit theories related to the specific domains being studied. The relevance of implicit theories to their respective domains or attributes is crucial [14]. However, previous research examining the relationship between implicit theories and trust has not demonstrated a strong correlation between the domains of these theories and trust, whether in the context of morality or personality. This lack of correlation could result in inconsistent research outcomes.

Additionally, Dweck et al. [14] highlight the indispensable influence of implicit theories on individual behavior within their respective domains. For instance, Tamir et al. [42] discovered that implicit theories of emotion, distinct from those of intelligence, are the sole predictors of individual emotional responses. Schroder et al. [39] explored seven distinct implicit theories related to mental health, encompassing anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality. Their study aimed to explore the individual impact of these implicit theories on specific mental health symptoms. The findings support both domain specificity (e.g., implicit theories of depression only predicted depression symptoms) and generality (i.e., the implicit theories of anxiety and the implicit theories of general factors predicted most symptoms). We hypothesize that inconsistencies in research linking implicit theories to trust may stem from debates over domain specificity versus generality. Domain generality is characterized by an overarching implicit theory that guides theories in each specific domain [10,27,53], with both the general and domain-specific implicit theories influencing individual behavior within those domains. And domain specificity refers to the uniqueness of implicit theories within each domain, suggesting that they operate relatively independently [7,44,51], with only domain-specific implicit theories exerting influence on individual behavior within that domain.

Given the inconsistencies in previous findings, this study primarily examines the applicability and structure of the implicit theories of trust within the trust domain, as well as their impact on individual trustworthiness, thereby assessing the domain specificity and generality of these theories. To compare specificity and generality across domains, this study draws upon previous research to introduce implicit theories from another domain as a reference point [10,27,44,51]. Consistent with the Proposed Model of Trust [16,33], a trustor evaluates a trustee’s trustworthiness based on competence, benevolence, and integrity. To facilitate comparative analysis, implicit theories of personality were integrated as a central component in the research design, given that personality traits encompass the three essential dimensions of trust evaluation: competence, benevolence, and integrity. The study introduces the implicit theories of personality as a benchmark to explore the generality and specificity of implicit theories of trust. Study 1 employs a survey methodology to preliminarily investigate the structure of the implicit theories of trust and to distinguish them from the implicit theories of personality. It also examines the distinct impacts of both sets of theories on individual trustworthiness. Study 2 utilizes a laboratory setting to confirm the influence of the implicit theories of trust on individual trustworthiness, thereby enhancing the reliability of the research findings.

Study 1 was to investigate the domain generality and specificity of implicit theories of trust, as well as to discern the distinctive influence of implicit theories of trust on interpersonal trust in comparison to implicit theories of personality. Based on previous research findings [44,51], we hypothesize that while the implicit theories of trust share a similar structure with the implicit theories of personality, their impact on an individual’s interpersonal trust differs from that of personality.

The survey (conducted in 2023) involved an online survey of 261 Chinese college students. However, seven participants were excluded due to regular answers (the answers were the same number). A total of 254 valid questionnaires were included in the analysis. The demographic breakdown of the participants was as follows: 52.0% male, and 48.0% female. Their ages spanned from 18 to 33 years, with a mean age of 21.16 years (SD= 1.91).

The Implicit Theories of Personality Scale developed by Levy, Stroessner, and Dweck [30] was used, with a total of 8 items and a 6-point score (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The study used a revised 8-item scale to measure entity and incremental theory as separate dimensions to reduce default bias. Four items represent entity theories, such as “Everyone is a certain kind of person, and there is not much that they can do to change that”, etc. And four items represent incremental theories, such as “People can substantially change the kind of person they are”, etc. Among them, the participants with entity theories are reverse scored, with higher scores representing stronger incremental theories and lower scores representing stronger entity theories. The scale has been well applied in the context of Chinese culture [7,20]. The internal consistency of the scale in this study wasα= 0.84.

The Implicit Theories of Trust Scale was adapted from the Implicit Theories of Personality Scale. The scale was developed following a rigorous process of psychological standardization, and its reliability and validity have been found to be within an acceptable range (see Supplementary Information part 1and part 2). The scale consisted of a total of seven items with a 6-point score (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The scoring method was the same as the Implicit Theories of Personality Scale. And three items represent entity theories. The internal consistency of the scale in this study wasα= 0.78.

The Interpersonal Trust Scale (ITS) prepared by Rotter [37] was used, with a total of 25 items and a 5-point score (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The scale mainly measured the general interpersonal trust of individuals in different situations and involving diverse social roles. The scale scores range from 25 to 125, with higher scores indicating higher levels of interpersonal trust. The internal consistency of the scale in this study wasα= 0.72. The scale has been well applied in the context of Chinese culture [12,46].

The study referred to previous studies [21,39] and use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the domain specificity and generality of implicit theories of trust. Four different models were constructed to analyze the latent construct of implicit theories of trust and implicit theories of personality. Model 1, a single-factor model, encompassed all 15 items from both scales within a single latent factor. Model 2 featured two interrelated latent factors, differentiating between implicit theories of trust and implicit theories of personality. Model 3, the bifactor model, consisted of two separate group factors representing trust and personality theories, with all items loading onto a general factor. The general factor was uncorrelated with each group factor. Model 4 was an adaptation of model 3, allowing for a correlation between the trust and personality factor groups. The models’ configurations are visually depicted in Fig.1.

Goodness of fit was evaluated using the Chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio (χ2/df) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Multiple indices were evaluated because they each provide complementary information regarding model fit. We used current recommendations [5,19] to guide interpretations and considered models to have acceptable fit if 1 < χ2/df < 3, 0.05 < RMSEA < 0.08, CFI > 0.95, and TLI > 0.95. And the smaller the values of AIB and BIC, the better.

In addition, the linear regression analysis (referred to as [53]) was employed to examine the distinct predictive effects of implicit theories of trust and implicit theories of personality on individual interpersonal trust, with gender and age as control variables. The study utilized interpersonal trust scores as the dependent variable and included both implicit theories of trust and implicit theories of personality as predictor variables.

Fit indexes of the four models were shown in Table1. The analysis revealed that both Model 3 and Model 4 had an acceptable overall fit, with Model 4 showing a notably better fit than Model 3. Model 4 indicated that implicit theories of trust were distinct from those of personality, they are underpinned by a common and consistent implicit theory. This result reflects the domain specificity and generality of the implicit theories of trust. On one hand, the implicit theories of trust are shaped by a more overarching implicit theory, reflecting the domain generality of implicit trust theories. On the other hand, the structural differences between the implicit theories of trust and personality highlight the domain specificity of implicit trust theories.

The regression analysis results (see Table2) revealed t a significant negative association between implicit theories of trust and interpersonal trust (β= −0.30,t= −4.49,95%CI= [−0.18, −0.07]), indicating that individuals with a stronger inclination towards the belief that trust is mutable, i.e., those with an incremental view, experienced lower levels of interpersonal trust. Conversely, implicit theories of personality exhibited a positive and significant impact on interpersonal trust (β= 0.34,t= 5.46,95%CI= [0.09, 0.19]), revealing that individuals who perceive personal traits as changeable tend to have higher interpersonal trust scores.

A post hoc sensitivity and power analysis was conducted using G*Power for the linear regression model with 254 participants. The analysis indicated that the study had a power of 80% to detect an effect size off2= 0.04 at an alpha level of 0.05. According to Cohen’s standard (1988),f2= 0.04 belongs to a small effect size (0.02 is small, 0.15 is medium, and 0.35 is large). Although the effect amount is small, the results of this study are significant, which, to some extent, explains the reliability of the results.

Based on the findings of Study 1, we observed significant differences in interpersonal trust between entity and incremental theorists, as per their respective implicit theories across domains. Specifically, individuals who believe that trust is unchangeable tend to trust others more, based on implicit theories of trust. Conversely, based on implicit theories of personality, individuals who believe that personality can change are more inclined to trust others. Study 2 employed experimental manipulations to delve deeper into the unique effects of implicit theories of trust and implicit theories of personality on trust decisions, thereby providing robust empirical evidence for the domain-specific nature of implicit theories of trust. Building on the findings from Study 1, we hypothesize that individuals primed with an entity theory of trust will exhibit a higher level of investment behavior in trust games compared to those primed with an incremental theory of trust, thereby indicating a greater propensity to trust others.

The present study employed a 2 (Implicit Domain: Personality vs. Trust) × 2 (Implicit Dimension: Entity Theorists vs. Incremental Theorists) between-subjects design on trust-related decisions. To ensure adequate statistical power (80%) and a 5% error rate, a sample size ofN= 128 was calculated to detect a small effect (ƒ= 0.25,η2p= 0.06). The study (conducted in 2023) recruited 183 Chinese college students to the lab through online advertising, with 33 excluded due to failed manipulation checks and 2 for exhibiting repetitive response patterns (consistently pressing either “invest” or “do not invest”). The final sample consisted of 148 participants, with 36.5% male and 63.5% female, aged between 16 and 30 (20.81 ± 2.17). A post hoc sensitivity power analysis for the interaction effect confirmed that our sample size allows for the detection of a moderate effect (ƒ= 0.23,η2p= 0.05) with a 5% significance level.

This study employs a 2 (Implicit Domain: Personality vs. Trust) × 2 (Implicit Dimension: Entity Theorists vs. Incremental Theorists) between-subjects design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups to undergo the corresponding experimental manipulation and complete a trust game. The trust choice rate (The ratio of the number of rounds the participant chose to invest (i.e., trust rounds) to the total number of rounds) in the trust game is the dependent variable of interest in this research.

Participants were engaged in a two-part experiment, with each segment seemingly unrelated. After collecting demographic data, participants are required to complete the Trust Propensity Scale [34], the Social Value Orientation Scale [35], and the Risk Perception Scale [41] to control for the influence of these variables on individual trust decisions. Then, participants proceeded to the main experimental phase as per the given instructions.

In the initial phase of our investigation, participants underwent implicit theory induction, randomly assigned by the experimenter to one of four experimental conditions. Each participant was assigned to read a specific essay tailored to evoke either entity trust, incremental trust, entity personality, or incremental personality beliefs, drawing on prior research [8,28]. Among them, the material regarding incremental theorists cites the perspectives of experts, who believe that trust or personality is capable of development (e.g., “Personality/Trust is changeable and can be influenced over time.”). By contrast, experts in the entity theorists cited argued that trust or personality is stable (e.g., “Personality/Trust seems to be rather fixed and to develop consistently along the same path over time.”). The reading session was set for five minutes, and the essays were collected post-reading. Following this, a manipulation check was mandatory for all participants.

The experiment began with a 500 ms fixation point of “ + ”, indicating that participants should prepare to press a key. Participants were then randomly paired with a stranger, followed by an 800—1200 ms interval. Trust decision options appeared, prompting participants to choose within a set time limit. They were instructed to press the “F” key to invest or the “J” key to not invest, with a duration of 2000 ms. After their decision, a random blank screen intervened for 800-1200 ms. The round’s outcome and participant’s token count were displayed for 2000 ms, before proceeding to the next round. To maintain balance, all trustees were computer-controlled, which returns the tokens at a rate of 50% and does not return at a rate of 50% throughout the entire task, to ensure that the reinforcement rate of positive outcomes (the proportion of positive feedback following trust choices) throughout the entire game is approximately 50%.

Apart from gender and age, the measurements of other covariates, including social risk preference, economic risk preference, trust propensity, and social value orientation, are presented in detail in the Supplementary Information part 3.

Due to the 2 (Implicit Domain: Personality vs. Trust) × 2 (Implicit Dimension: Entity Theorists vs. Incremental Theorists) between-subjects design of this study, a two-factor analysis of variance was used to investigate the influence of implicit domain (Personality vs. Trust) and dimension (Entity Theorists vs. Incremental Theorists) on trust-related decision-making. The study controlled for several covariates: gender, age, social risk aversion, economic risk preference, trust tendency, and social value orientation, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the factors at play. The study uses the investment choice rate of the trust game, i.e., the trust choice rate, as the dependent variable.

A pilot study was conducted to validate the manipulation’s effectiveness, recruiting 146 participants. They were assigned to read one of four induction essays: promoting an incremental view of trust, an entity view of trust, an incremental view of personality, or an entity view of personality. The findings demonstrated a significant impact of the induction on implicit theories, particularly in personality and trust. Participants who endorsed the incremental perspective showed a greater inclination to view personality or trust as dynamic (Personality: 4.09 ± 0.96 vs. 2.36 ± 0.89; Trust: 4.58 ± 0.96 vs. 2.43 ± 0.53), indicating a stronger entity vs. incremental view.

The results of the manipulation check indicated that the manipulation was successful in influencing participants’ implicit theories. Specifically, no matter in the field of trust (entity: 2.46 ± 0.79, incremental: 4.63 ± 0.63) or personality (entity: 2.49 ± 0.92, incremental: 4.86 ± 0.73), the participants who read the essays promoting an incremental view scored significantly higher in the variable degree than those who read the essays promoting an entity view. The differences were statistically significant (Trust:t= 13.28,p< 0.001; Personality:t= 12.12,p< 0.001), indicating a clear shift in participants’ beliefs after the manipulation.

The findings of ANOVA showed that neither the main effect of the implicit domain (F(1, 144) = 0.68,p= 0.412,η2p= 0.01) nor that of implicit dimension (F(1, 144) = 0.01,p= 0.913,η2p= 0.00) were statistically significant. However, a significant interaction between domain and dimension emerged,F(1, 144) = 8.41,p= 0.004,η2p= 0.06. Based on Cohen’s [9] criteria (large: 0.14, medium: 0.06, and small: 0.01), the significant interaction between domain and dimension represented a medium effect size. This meant that the interaction between the two explained 6% variance of individual trust decision. Simple effects results (see Fig.2) revealed a difference in trust choice rates between entity and incremental view groups in the context of personality that approached conventional significance (F(1, 144) = 3.82,p= 0.053,η2p= 0.03), with the incremental view group demonstrating a slightly higher rate (entity: 0.49 ± 0.16, incremental: 0.53 ± 0.13). Conversely, in the domain of trust, the incremental view group exhibited significantly lower trust choice rates (0.50 ± 0.15) compared to the entity view group (0.57 ± 0.17;F(1, 144) = 5.22,p= 0.034, η2p= 0.03).

Since Dweck et al. [11,15] the implicit theories of negotiation [17], and the implicit theories of relation [32], etc. This study aimed to explore the latent structure of implicit theories of trust, which was initially examined in Study 1. The findings aligned with previous research, revealing a two-dimensional structure: entity and incremental theories [39,42]. Entity theory posits that individuals view trust as static and unchanging, while incremental theory suggests a dynamic and evolving perspective on trust.

Previous studies have dedicated themselves to investigating the domain generality and specificity of implicit theories, with some research focusing on generality [21] and others highlighting its domain-specific nature [53]. This study uncovered that the domain specificity of implicit theories of trust manifests in two distinct dimensions. Firstly, the study aimed to differentiate implicit theories of trust from those of personality by examining their structural disparities, using implicit theories of personality as a benchmark. Model 3 and Model 4, both displaying superior fit indices, supported the notion that trust and personality implicit theories are distinct yet interrelated. Model 4 marginally outperformed Model 3, revealing a nuanced correlation between the two implicit theories. This result aligns with the understanding that implicit theories exhibit both domain generality and specificity, as per Schroder et al. [39]. Secondly, the study distinguished the domain specificity of implicit theories by showing that trust is influenced differently by implicit theories of trust compared to personality. Individuals with entity theories of trust, perceiving trust as unchanging, demonstrated a higher inclination to trust, while those with incremental theories exhibited lower trust levels. Conversely, implicit theory of personality had the opposite effect, with entity theorists displaying lower trust.

The disparity between implicit theories of trust and personality might stem from trust's inherent characteristics. Trust, marked by vulnerability and risk [33,49], can lead individuals with incremental theories of trust to perceive higher risk, prompting them to avoid trusting to minimize potential risks. Additionally, cultural factors, particularly Chinese tradition, may also have contributed to the difference. Trust was a foundational element in ancient Chinese society, serving as the moral bedrock for both past and present [52]. Confucius’ maxim, “Without trust, one knows not what to do,” underscores the perceived immutability of trust. In contrast, personality development focuses on moral cultivation and self-improvement (emphasis on incremental theories). Consequently, entity theories of trust and incremental theories of personality are linked to positive behavior. Just like the results of this study, individuals with the entity theories of trust and individuals with the gradual theories of personality are more willing to trust others.

The study aimed to investigate the existence and distinctiveness of an implicit theory of trust within the trust domain, as well as its relationship with interpersonal trust. Findings revealed the presence of implicit theories of trust, which distinctively differed from implicit theories of personality. Contrary to personality theories, implicit theories of trust exert unique influences on interpersonal trust. Despite these findings, the study had certain limitations. Initially, it utilized implicit theories of personality as a benchmark for exploring the domain generality and specificity of implicit trust theories, without specifying dimensions like benevolence or integrity. This abstraction of “personality” compared to the concrete nature of trust may have affected the observed differences in their impact on interpersonal trust. Future research should address this by differentiating specific personality traits when compared with trust. Second, the study did not clearly distinguish between various trust concepts, as per Wrightsman [45] and Mayer et al. [33] perspectives. This could lead to inconsistent interpretations of trust among participants. Future work should refine the definition of trust to ensure the implicit theories of trust's consistency and applicability. Finally, the small sample size during the model validation process introduces potential uncertainty to the research findings. Bader et al. [1] pointed out that, under comprehensive conditions, a bifactor model requires a sample size of 500. Future research still needs to expand the sample size to further test and validate the results of this study, thereby enhancing the stability and generalizability of the research findings.

This pioneering study aimed to establish the presence of implicit theories of trust within the trust domain and examine their connection to interpersonal trust. The study, mirroring previous research on implicit theories, categorized implicit theories of trust into entity theorists and incremental theories, reflecting the domain specificity inherent in implicit theories. Notably, individuals who perceive trust as an immutable characteristic are inclined to extend trust to others.
