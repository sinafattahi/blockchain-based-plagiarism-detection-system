Loss to follow-up (LTFU) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is a concerning reality in various healthcare services and can occur at any stage of HIV care. LTFU can lead to a decline in overall health and quality of life for PLHIV; moreover, antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption increase the risk of HIV sexual transmission. This systematic review investigated factors related to LTFU among PLHIV. The review included sources from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and others. We included observational studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2024. We identified 36 studies from 20 countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The studies included 69,789 PLHIV, of whom 22% were classified as LTFU. The time frame used to define LTFU varied across studies, ranging from 14 to 365 days. The most frequently reported factors associated with LTFU were younger age, low educational level, financial instability, illicit drug use, stigma, absence of family and social support, and ART side effects. Other relevant factors included long commuting time to healthcare facilities, long waiting time at health units, and issues with provider-patient relationships. Multiple factors may contribute to LTFU among PLHIV in complex and context-dependent ways. To address this issue, healthcare services must develop a comprehensive understanding of the communities they assist, recognizing distinct subgroups and their specific needs. Public health policies should be implemented to promote continuous care for PLHIV, including early diagnosis, multidisciplinary assessment, and social support.

Retention in follow-up is essential within clinical care for people living with HIV (PLHIV)1. The UNAIDS 95-95-95, aimed at ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 20302, set the goals for 95% of PLHIV being aware of their serological status; with 95% of those diagnosed receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART), and with 95% of those on ART achieve an undetectable viral load2. Achieving these targets requires a thorough understanding of and substantial investment in strategies to promote patient adherence to uninterrupted care3. From a public health perspective, retention in care is also key for controlling the HIV epidemic since sexual transmission of HIV does not occur from PLHIV under ART with an undetectable viral load4. However, loss to follow-up (LTFU) remains a common occurrence among PLHIV in healthcare services worldwide5-8. For instance, Zagoet al.9reported a 25% LTFU rate among PLHIV enrolled in a specialized HIV service in Vitoria city, Brazil. Similar findings were reported in the United States8,10, Mozambique11-13, Uganda14,15, and Zambia16,17.

Adherence is crucial for the effectiveness of HIV treatment3,18, involving dynamic and multifactorial processes encompassing physical, psychological, social, cultural, and behavioral aspects. It requires collaborative decision-making and shared responsibility between PLHIV, healthcare providers, and social support networks18. Although retention in care is relevant for managing any chronic condition, HIV-associated stigma may uniquely influence the risk of LTFU among PLHIV19. Such stigma may occur within healthcare services20, creating direct barriers continued care. Stigma may also originate from family, friends, coworkers, and other social interactions. In a study including 1,784 PLHIV in Brazil, 64% had suffered some form of stigma or discrimination due to their HIV status, and 46% reported being significantly affected by it21. Internalized stigma may also negatively influence treatment adherence22. Stigma may also affect the extent to which individuals tolerate the side effects of antiretrovirals without discontinuing treatment. For instance, stigmatizing side effects associated with first-generation antiretrovirals, such as lipodystrophy, may impact self-esteem and treatment adherence23.

LTFU is a complex issue with multiple determinants, including social and behavioral factors. It may be defined according to different criteria, including failure to pick up antiretroviral medications from the pharmacy or healthcare unit withing the expected timeframe; missing a scheduled appointment; or failing to attend follow-up visits within a specified period24,25. Some studies suggest increasing trends in LTFU among PLHIV11,18. Despite the significant challenges in ensuring retention in care and sustained ART adherence, LTFU-associated factors remain not fully understood.

This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence on factors associated with LTFU among PLHIV. Understanding the determinants and context of LTFU in this population could provide valuable insights for developing interventions and strategies to address this pressing challenge.

This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines26. The initial research included the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Additional articles, retrieved from citations of included articles, were also selected. We selected studies published from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2024, reporting factors associated with LTFU among adult PLHIV. The following search terms were used: “loss to follow-up,” “discontinuation,” “drop out,” “out of care,” “abandonment,” “stopping,” “interruption,” and “unstable patients” (Supplementary Table S1). All articles were imported into EndNote reference management software, version X9 (Clarivate), whereby duplicates were excluded using the “Find Duplicates” function, as described by Bramer27. Two investigators (ZMS and EF da S) independently screened titles and abstracts to identify studies relevant to the research objectives. A third investigator (PAN) resolved any discrepancies. The screening process included peer-reviewed original studies published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, with LTFU timeframes defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health guidelines. We included observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies) that enrolled PLHIV aged 18 years and older, regardless of sex.

Full texts for studies selected based on title and abstract were reviewed by four independent reviewers (ZMS, EF da S, PAN, and ASB) to extract data on factors associated with LTFU among PLHIV. Title, journal, URL or DOI address, study location, year of publication, data source, study objectives, study design, sample size, total number of participants classified as LTFU stratified by sex, duration of LTFU, and factors associated with LTFU identified in each study were extracted and organized in a standardized form (Supplementary Table S2). Studies were then categorized according to study design, including cross-sectional, retrospective cohort, prospective cohort, and case-control. Our search did not identify clinical trials meeting the selection criteria. Studies with outcomes unrelated to the proposed topic or with a design outside our inclusion criteria were excluded.

All studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent a risk of bias analysis conducted independently by two authors (ZMS and EFS) using the Cochrane Collaboration “Risk of Bias” tool28. Six criteria were evaluated across four types of bias: selection bias, performance and detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias (Supplementary Table S3).

This study is based exclusively on published literature and did not require approval from an ethics review board.

The SPSS statistical software (version 21.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all analysis. From the extracted data, we calculated the percentage of LTFU stratified by sex for each study using the following formula:n/N*100%;n1/N1*100%; ΣF+M, in which: F: female; M: male; T: total; %: percentage; n: number of partial sample included in the study stratified by sex; N: total sample included in the study; n1: number of participants LTFU stratified by sex; N1: total number of participants LTFU among PLHIV.

Although some studies identified similar factors associated with LTFU, we observed substantial heterogeneity in terms of design and definitions, preventing us to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, we opted for a narrative review. Factors associated with LTFU reported in the studies were categorized into three subgroups: sociodemographic factors, clinical factors, and service-related factors. We used GraphPad Prism version 9.02 to develop graphical representations of our findings.

A total of 8,328 citations were identified via database searches and other sources, including publications retrieved from citations within the included articles. Of these, 8,165 were excluded after title and abstract screening. These A total of 114 duplicates, 7,852 studies unrelated to the topic, and 199 studies that did not meet at least one inclusion criteria were excluded. The remaining 163 studies were selected for full-text review, of which 127 were excluded. Ultimately, 36 articles were included in this systematic review (Figure 1).

Studies selected for this analysis generally exhibited poor quality in terms of study design, with a moderate risk of bias (Supplementary Table S3).

A total of 36 primary studies from 20 different countries were included (Figure 2). The study designs were as follows: 12 cross-sectional studies, 18 retrospective cohort studies, five prospective cohort studies, and one case-control study (Table 1). These articles comprehensively addressed the topic by evaluating the characteristics of PLHIV who experienced LTFU, describing the participants and providing data on factors leading to LTFU among adult PLHIV. Some studies included a qualitative component, primarily comprising structured interviews.

F = female; M = male; T = total; % = percentage; n = number of partial sample included in the study stratified by gender; N = total sample included in the study; n1 = number of participants who LTFU stratified by gender; N1 = total number of participants who LTFU among PLHIV; UN = undetermined; > = greater than; ≥ = greater or equal.

Table 1summarizes the characteristics of all studies included in this systematic review, including number of participants, number of PLHIV who were LTFU stratified by sex, duration of LTFU, study design, study period and location. Regarding participants’ characteristics, the most common age range was 18 to 44 years of age, with a predominance of males (57%) (Table 1). Common socioeconomic issues included low education11,29-34, unemployment6,16,31,34-36, illicit drugs use9,35,37-40, and economic difficulties6,10-12,16,32,38,41-43.

The number of participants varied across studies, ranging from as few as eight PLHIV from a study conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil44, to as many as 12,013 participants in a study conducted in Nigeria30. Our review included a total of 69,789 PLHIV, of whom 15,589 (22.33%) were LTFU. Among the latter, 61% were male; the percentage of women living with HIV who were subsequently LTFU was 20%, compared to 24% among men. The criteria for defining LTFU varied by country but generally involved not collecting ART from the health unit’s pharmacy for more than 90 days.

Structured interviews and medical records analysis were the most common methods to identify factors associated with LTFU9,11,30,33,35,41,44-46. For better organization, we categorized these factors into three subgroups: sociodemographic, clinical, and service-related factors.

Risk factors identified in this category included: sex, younger age (18–34 years), single marital status, low education or illiteracy, economic difficulties, unemployment or unstable employment, work obligations, childcare responsibilities, food insecurity, lack of family or social support, stigma, self-concealment of HIV status, limited knowledge about HIV and ART, and disbelief in ART. Additional relevant factors included belief in traditional medicine and religion, perceived physical improvement, disability, patient self-transfer, Black skin color, current smoker, use of illicit drugs, and criminal history (Figure 3).

Twelve studies found that younger PLHIV were more likely to experience LTFU, specifically those aged 18 to 34 years8,10,15,16,29,30,35,38,39,47-49. Schilkowskyet al.35observed that the risk of LTFU was higher among PLHIV aged 18 to 29 years, with a reduction of approximately 5.0% for each additional year of age. A similar study in Lusaka, Zambia, identified that PLHIV aged 25 to 34 years were at higher risk of LTFU16. In Canada, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for LTFU among younger PLHIV was 1.26 (aHR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.17–1.81)47. In Nigeria, one study found that the risk of LTFU among PLHIV decreases with increasing age (aHR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98–0.99)30. These findings were consistent across multiple studies8,10,15,16,29,30,35,38,39,47-49, showing that younger age is a significant predictor of LTFU among PLHIV.

Six studies linked LTFU among PLHIV with the female sex10,16,37,39,47,48. Mugaet al.37reported that approximately 70% of female PLHIV in Spain were LTFU during clinical follow-up , compared to 28.95% of males, indicating a 7.9-fold risk among women (RR = 7.9; 95% CI: 0.0–69.5). Similar findings were reported in Zambia16and Canada47, where LTFU among women was 68.0% and 34.49%, respectively, compared to 32.0% and 20.81% among men. Other studies10,39,48reported similar trends. However, contrasting results were observed in South Africa, in which LTFU was more frequent among men (16.6%) than women (11.1%)46. Similar results were reported in Ethiopia50.

Two studies reported associations between being single and increased risk of LTFU among PLHIV30,35. Schilkowskyet al.35found that single participants had a 1.5 times higher risk of LTFU compared to their married counterparts (aHR = 1.502; 95% CI: 1.007–2.240). A similar study conducted in Nigeria reported a risk ratio of 1.24 for single PLHIV (aHR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12–1.38)30.

Two studies associated Black ethnicity with higher LTFU rates among PLHIV8,48. In a U.S.-based study, Black PLHIV had higher risk of LTFU, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.13–1.45) compared to White participants8. Another U.S. study reported a similar finding (RR = 1.46; 1.08–1.99; P = 0.015)48.

Three studies found that perceived physical improvement was associated with LTFU51-53. In Nigeria, 6.7% of PLHIV were lost to follow-up because they felt healthy52. In Ethiopia, 32.9% of PLHIV stopped taking ART because they believed they had been cured53. Similar observations were made in South Africa51. Conversely, PLHIV with physical or mental disabilities were also at high risk of LTFU48.

Seven studies associated low educational levels or illiteracy to higher rates of LTFU11,29-34. In Nigeria, PLHIV with low education levels had an increased risk of LFTU (aHR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.12–1.40)30. Similar findings were observed in other studies conducted in Nigeria31Mozambique11, Uganda32, Côte d’Ivoire29, and China34.

Ten studies associated LTFU among PLHIV with economic difficulties6,10-12,16,31,32,38,41,42. In Western Uganda, 93% of PLHIV who were LTFU reported low economic conditions, often related with difficulties in accessing transportation to healthcare facilities41. Similar findings were reported in South Africa42and Zambia16. In Mozambique, 162 PLHIV were classified as LTFU due to financial difficulties related to food and transportation12; this was observed in another report from Mozambique11. In Uganda, PLHIV without a personal telephone number for follow-up contact had a higher risk of LTFU (aHR = 1.69; 95%CI: 1.50–1.91)32. Other studies reported similar results6,10,31,38.

Six studies linked LTFU among PLHIV to unemployment or unstable employment6,16,31,34-36. In a Brazilian study, LTFU risk was significantly higher among PLHIV with unstable jobs35; similar findings were reported in Eswatini36. Mushekeet al.16reported that fear of job loss contributed to LTFU among PLHIV in Zambia. In Nigeria, unemployed individuals had an increased risk of LTFU (aHR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.2–2.6)31. Work responsibilities and childcare commitments were also associated with LTFU6.

Three studies associated LTFU among PLHIV with food insecurity12,33,54. Food insecurity was the most frequently reported factor among PLHIV who were LTFU, affecting approximately 42.9% of cases33. Similar findings were reported in Mozambique12,54.

Migration or nomadism was also linked to LTFU among PLHIV33,36,51. In Eswatini, patient mobility in search of better living conditions was the key contributor to LTFU36. Similarly, Moda and Palombi33reported that 11.4% of LTFU cases among PLHIV in Chibabava, Mozambique, were influenced by nomadism. Additionally, self-transfer of patients was associated with a higher risk of LTFU in South Africa51.

Six studies found that a lack of family and social support contributed to LTFU6,7,10,11,16,36. In a Brazilian study, emotional distress and family issues were linked to LTFU7. In Zambia, fear of losing family support was a significant contributor to LTFU16. Maregaet al.11identified that the absence of a confidant was associated with LTFU among PLHIV in Mozambique. In Eswatini, the lack of a social support was also related to LTFU36, and similar results were reported in the United States10. In Uganda, PLHIV discontinued care after being advised by their families not to return to the healthcare unit (aHR = 4.2; 95%CI: 0.5–14.0)15.

Seven studies reported associations between stigma and LTFU11,15,16,33,41,43,54. In a study conducted in Uganda, 58% of LTFU cases were attributed to stigma related to HIV status41. Similar findings were observed in Mozambique11,54. Mushekeet al.16reported that fear of anticipated stigma was a significant contributor to LTFU in Zambia. Nsohet al.43identified stigma as the most prominent predictor of treatment interruption (47.5%) among PLHIV in Cameroon; similar results were reported in Uganda15.

Four studies showed that LTFU among PLHIV was related to non-disclosure of serological status16,41,50,55. In Uganda, fear of having their serological status discovered—along with associated stigma—were significant reasons for LTFU, affecting 58% of participants16. Similar observations were reported in Zambia41. In The Republic of the Congo, PLHIV who did not share their HIV status had a significantly higher risk of LTFU (aHR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.46–2.29)55. Likewise, in Ethiopia, non-disclosure was related to higher risk of LTFU (aHR = 2.8; 95%CI: 2.22–5.23)50.

Lack of knowledge about HIV and ART was related to LTFU among PLHIV in a study performed in Zambia16. Contributing factors included disbelief in the effectiveness of ART to improve quality of life, as well as a preference for traditional medicine and religious beliefs in healing16. Likewise, Duffet al.41reported that 60% of PLHIV who abandoned ART in Uganda were unaware of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

Six studies identified that illicit drug use contributed to LTFU among PLHIV9,10,35,37,38,47,49. In a Brazilian study, drug users had 2.3 times higher odds of experiencing LTFU compared to non-users (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.3; 95%CI: 1.03–5.07)9. In Canada, the risk was also elevated among drug users (aHR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.09–1.89)36, with similar observations reported in Spain37. Schilkowskyet al.35, in a study from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, found that LTFU was associated both with illicit drug use and with having a criminal record. Similar findings were reported in England38, the United States10, and Australia49. Moreover, a U.S. study found that current smoking was also related to higher risk of LTFU (RR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.18–1.50)8.

Several clinical factors have been associated with LTFU among PLHIV. These include long delay between diagnosis and the first appointment; delays or failure in delivering laboratory test results; low CD4+ T cell counts; viral load >1,000 copies/mL; advanced disease stage; absence of initial adherence counseling; delays or interruptions in medication delivery; issues with ART adherence; and ART regimen modification. Additional contributing factors include delayed initiation of ART; adherence issues within the first 6 months of ART; prior episodes of LTFU; missing visits in ART dispensation days; high pill burden; ART-related side effects or drug toxicity; and treatment failure (Figure 4).

The time interval between HIV diagnosis and the first medical appointment has been linked to LTFU among PLHIV35. A Brazilian study found a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0051) in this lag time between diagnosis and first medical consultation among PLHIV who were lost to follow-up (average delay of 1 year and 4 months for the LTFU group, compared to 7.5 months for those in regular follow-up35. These findings suggest that a longer interval between diagnosis and the first appointment is related to higher likelihood of LTFU, similar to a finding reported in the United States10.

Two studies found a relationship between delays or non-delivery of laboratory test results and LTFU among PLHIV16,44. In Zambia, one study found that some participants reported that they discontinued care due to not receiving test results16. Similarly, a study from Brazil identified that delays in delivering laboratory results contributed to LTFU44.

Four studies associated LTFU among PLHIV with CD4+ T cell counts <350 cells/mm3, viral load >1,000 copies/mL, and advanced disease stage9-11,32,41. A Brazilian study found higher odds of LTFU among PLHIV with CD4+ counts <200 cells/mm3(aOR = 1.5; 95%CI: 1.03–2.10) and among those with viral load >1,000 copies/mL (aOR = 2.0; 95%CI: 1.34–3.09)9. In Uganda, Kiwanukaet al.32reported an increased risk of ART non-adherence among PLHIV with CD4+ cell counts of 200-350 μ/ml (aHR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.01–1.45) and among those at WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 at baseline (aHR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.10–1.65). Similar findings were reported in Uganda41, Mozambique11, and the United States10. Conversely, two studies conducted in Canada47and South Africa46also reported LTFU among PLHIV with CD4+ counts ≥350 cells/mm3. Additionally, a study from Malaysia found that tuberculosis co-infection was strongly related to LTFU (aOR = 2.0; 95%CI: 1.1–3.7, p = 0.025)56.

Two studies reported that LTFU among PLHIV was associated with delays in the delivery of medications16,44. In Zambia, participants indicated that abandonment of treatment was driven by unavailability of antiretroviral medications at their health unit, leading to frustration and fatigue due to prolonged waiting times16. Similarly, Rodrigues and Maksud44reported that delays in medication delivery at scheduled monthly visits contributed significantly to LTFU among PLHIV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Additionally, the lack of initial adherence counseling was also related to LTFU among PLHIV in Côte d’Ivoire29.

Seven studies reported that delayed ART initiation was associated with a higher risk of LTFU among PLHIV8,29,32,34,46,47,49. In Uganda, patients who initiated ART more than seven days after diagnosis had a higher risk of LTFU (aHR = 1.69; 95%CI: 1.50–1.91)32. Similar findings were reported in studies from Canada47and South Africa46. In China, Maet al.34found that delayed ART initiation was related to a higher risk of LTFU (aHR = 1.43; 95%CI: 1.10–1.85). Other studies also reported similar results8,29,49.

Three studies associated the type of ART regimen or a regimen switch with LTFU among PLHIV34,47,56. In Canada, patients who initiated treatment with zidovudine had a 2.47-fold higher risk of LTFU compared to those receiving tenofovir (aHR = 2.47; 95%CI: 1.92–3.20)47. A study in China reported that patients starting ART with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate had a higher risk of LTFU compared to those receiving zidovudine (aHR = 5.19; 95%CI: 3.29–8.21)34. Interestingly, in Malaysia, a history of ART regimen switch was significantly associated with LTFU (aOR = 5.3; 95%CI: 2.2–13.1; p<0.001)56.

The frequency of missed ART dispensation visits was also related to LTFU among PLHIV30. In Nigeria, PLHIV with an average adherence rate <95% for medication pickup appointments had significantly higher risk of LTFU (aHR = 2.13; 95%CI 1.9–2.40)30. A history of prior or short-term LTFU was also identified as a predictor of subsequent LTFU49.

Five studies associated ARV side effects with LTFU among PLHIV7,12,16,36,53. In a Brazilian study, ART side effects were the primary reason reported for discontinuing care7. Similarly, ART side effects accounted for 8.0% of LFTU cases in rural districts of Mozambique12. Similar results were observed in Zambia16and Eswatini36. Additional factors contributing to LFTU included high pill burden, drug toxicity, and treatment failure, as reported by a study from the United States8.

In the risk factors category, LTFU among PLHIV was associated with long distances between patients’ residences and healthcare facilities, logistical issues within health units, and extended waiting times for care. Notably, poor patient-provider relationships were also reported as significant contributors to LTFU (Figure 5).

In a study from Zambia, long distances between patients’ residences and the healthcare unit was related to LTFU among PLHIV, resulting in 25 participants being LTFU16. Seven studies identified several service-related factors contributing to LTFU, including logistical issues, disorganization within healthcare services, and long waiting times for care11,16,33,36,41,42,44. For instance, a study from South Africa reported that logistical issues—such as inadequate referral and transfer processes, lack of patient advocates, and limited outpatient hours on weekends—exacerbated LTFU42. In Zambia, PLHIV reported long wait times, poor quality of care, and fatigue due to lengthy clinical appointments as reasons for LFTU16. Similar issues were reported in Mozambique11,33, Brazil44, Uganda41, and Eswatini36.

Six studies associated LTFU with poor patient-provider relationships12,16,36,41,44,55. In Mozambique, 42% of LTFU were attributed to poor relationships and/or conflicts between healthcare providers and PLHIV12. A similar finding was reported in Eswatini36. In Zambia, participants cited rudeness from facility staff as a reason for LTFU16. Likewise, in a study from Uganda, 32% of LTFU cases were linked to poor relationship between doctors and patients41, and similar findings were observed in Brazil44.

In this study, we systematically investigated the available evidence regarding factors related to LTFU among PLHIV, based on 36 original observational studies conducted across 20 countries. Our analysis identified three main categories of factors contributing to LTFU: sociodemographic, clinical, and service-related factors.

Although several studies identified similar factors related to LTFU, the underlying motivations are multifactorial, complex, and context-specific. Healthcare services must consider the diverse experiences and the needs of different population groups, each of which faces distinct challenges in how they live, experience illness, and access care18. Overlooking these specific characteristics may increase the risk of LTFU, compromising the quality of life of PLHIV and hindering the progress towards achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets to end the HIV epidemic by 20302.

Several studies in our analysis found that PLHIV aged 18–34 years and those who are single are at higher risk of LTFU8,10,15,16,29,30,35,38,39,47-49. This increased risk among the youth may be influenced by factors related to cognitive, sexual, psychological, and physical development57. These findings highlight the need to intensify counseling programs on HIV/AIDS and ART within healthcare settings to improve retention rates among young PLHIV.

Our findings also indicate females may be at greater risk of LTFU among PLHIV10,16,37,39,47,48; this results, however, are inconsistent across studies10,39,48, suggesting that gender-related factors influencing LTFU are contextual. In Zambia, economic dependence and fear of losing a spouse influenced many women to avoid disclosing their HIV status, resulting in LTFU16. Empowering women and intensifying human rights awareness could help address this barrier. In Canada, Samjiet al.47suggested that the higher risk among women could be partially attributed to ART initiation during pregnancy, followed by treatment discontinuation. Healthcare units should closely monitor pregnant women living with HIV, as they may be particularly vulnerable to LTFU. Additionally, women may experience more frequent and severe ART side effects and toxicities compared to men, due to physiological differences and the influence of sex hormones on drug metabolism47.

Factors such as low education or illiteracy, migration or nomadism, unemployment or unstable employment, low economic status, and food insecurity are closely linked to poverty. These variables significantly contributed to LTFU among PLHIV in many studies11,12,16,30,32-36,54,58. For example, financial constraints limiting access to transportation and nutrition, as well as the need for frequent relocation in search of better living conditions (nomadism), are poverty-related factors associated with LTFU33. Public policies that promote employment opportunities and provide financial support for individuals living in poverty could positively impact retention in care for PLHIV.

Discrimination, lack of family and social support, as well as stigma, can significantly discourage PLHIV from continuing in care7,11,16,33,36,41,54. Without social and psychological support, patients may lose confidence and consequently self-exclude from care11. To address these issues, we suggest implementing public policies that promote social inclusion, provide emotional support, and combat HIV-related stigma. Additionally, educational programs should emphasize themes of love, respect, and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their HIV status.

Disbelief in ART is another factor contributing to treatment discontinuation. Studies showed that some patients place greater trust in traditional medicine and faith healing16. Rather than viewing faith and traditional medicine as obstacles to ART adherence, healthcare providers and peer navigators should be trained to educate patients about the benefits of ART while respecting their beliefs. Use of illicit drugs and a criminal history have also been related to LTFU among PLHIV9,35,37,47. Healthcare units should pay special attention to this group, as they often face significant social exclusion that can undermine their confidence and retention in care35.

Regarding clinical and laboratory monitoring of PLHIV, timely medical consultations and prompt ART initiation after diagnosis are crucial. Delays between diagnosis and the first appointment have been associated with increased risk of LTFU35. It is also essential that laboratory test results are delivered promptly during routine consultations and clearly explained to the patient10,11,26,52,59. Explaining the implications of test results and potential consequences of ART abandonment can help mitigate LTFU.

During routine follow-up, patients who frequently miss ART medication pickup appointments should be informed about risks associated with LTFU for PLHIV30. A dedicated team should make all efforts to contact or visit these patients to understand and address their needs, concerns, and barriers to care. Previous studies showed that key factors contributing to LTFU include delays in medication delivery, ART regimen issues, treatment adjustments during the first six months of therapy, delayed ART initiation, high pill burden, drug toxicity, treatment failure, and side effects7,12,16,30,32,34,36,46. When ART regimen modifications occur, patients should be carefully informed about the reasons for change, potential side effects, and the expected duration of side effects18.

Healthcare services are also crucial in preventing LTFU among PLHIV. Distance between a patient’s residence and the healthcare unit can affect LTFU, particularly for economically disadvantaged patients who struggle with transportation costs. Several studies have identified this as a key factor affecting retention in care11,16. Thus, health programs should consider restructuring and decentralizing HIV services, including ART distribution sites. Logistical challenges, disorganized services, and long waiting times have also been associated with increased risk of LTFU11,16,33,36,41,44. Finally, poor patient-provider relationships have been identified as significant factors related to LTFU12,16,36,41,44. HIV services should implement training programs for healthcare providers that emphasize not only technical aspects but also empathy, respect, and human rights.

Although some studies identified similar factors associated with LTFU, we observed substantial heterogeneity in study design and definitions, precluding our ability to proceed with a meta-analysis. Therefore, we opted for a narrative review approach.

LTFU among PLHIV can occur at any stage of clinical care. Sociodemographic, clinical, and health service-related factors may contribute to this outcome. Common sociodemographic factors include young age, low education, financial difficulties, illicit drugs use, stigma, and lack of family and social support. Clinical and service-related contributors include delayed ART initiation, medication side effects, long distances to healthcare facilities, and long waiting times. These factors disrupt treatment continuity, hindering the health and quality of life of PLHIV and undermining efforts to control the HIV epidemic. Appropriate measures to ensure ART adherence should be developed considering diverse community, cultural, and environmental contexts. Healthcare services and providers must understand the specific needs and challenges of the populations they serve. Additionally, public and healthcare policies should be developed and implemented to ensure continuous care for PLHIV, from diagnosis to retention in care.
