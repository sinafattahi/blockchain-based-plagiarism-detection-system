Kidney disease; including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health burden, contributing to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with any degree of renal disease are at risk of drug metabolism and excretory function loss. Toxicity from lack of proper drug or metabolite excretion and ineffective dosing from renal adjustment likely affects the clinical outcome of critical patients among other factors. In Ethiopia, predictors of poor outcomes related to dose adjustments remain understudied, causing uncertainty in clinical dosing practices. This study aimed to assess renal drug dose adjustment practice and patient outcomes in hospitalized patients with kidney diseases.

An institution-based, Cross-sectional study was conducted from December, 01/2023- February, 29/2024. A total of 403 patients were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data which was entered to Epi data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize socio-demographic and clinical data, as well as the proportions of patients with poor treatment outcomes and the proportions that received different levels of renal drug dosage adjustment services. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio with a confidence interval of 95% and a P value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant of predictors with patients treatment outcome.

Among the 384 patients with renal disease, more than one-third (36.5%), 95%CI (31.8%-41.3%) had poor treatment outcomes. The practice of renal drug dose adjustment was poor; revealing only 23.2% compliance with dosing guidelines. Partial renal drug dose adjustment (AOR= 2.76, 95% CI:1.14-6.71), no renal drug dose adjustments (AOR= 10.15, 95% CI: 3.88-26.57), mechanical ventilator use (AOR=2.90, 95% CI:1.69-12.19), vasopressor use (AOR=10.01, 95% CI: 4.27-22.73), presence of comorbidity(AOR=3.42, 95% CI:1.56-7.51), advanced stage of AKI: stage II (AOR= 2.51, 95% CI:1.15-5.45) and stage III (AOR=2.92, 95%CI: 1.29-6.57), intrinsic type of AKI(AOR=3.56, 95%CI:1.57-8.06) and age above 60 years(AOR=5.50, 95%CI: 2.26-13.41) were associated with poor patient outcome defined by development of complications, need for dialysis or death.

This study revealed that there is a significant level of poor patient outcomes in hospitalized patients with renal failure. Patients receiving partial or no drug dose adjustments were associated with significantly poorer clinical outcomes along with other factors including old age, presence of comorbidities, severity and type of AKI. Therefore, we recommend a holistic approach in the care of renal patients and prompt consideration of adherence to guidelines in drug dosing.

Renal disease, encompassing both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a major global health concern, affecting over 33 million people worldwide and contributing to approximately 5–10 million deaths annually [1,2]. AKI, characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, and CKD, defined by persistent abnormalities in kidney structure or function for over three months, are both associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden, especially in hospitalized patients [3–7]. Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to renal disease due to factors such as sepsis, hemodynamic instability, and nephrotoxic drug exposure [5,7,8]. Among the studies that adopted a Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) - equivalent AKI definition, AKI affects 20.9% of patients admitted to hospital settings and 31.7% of patients in critical care settings.

Patients with kidney disease often require multiple medications to manage underlying illnesses and complications [9–13]. The kidneys play a critical role in drug metabolism and excretion; hence, impaired renal function necessitates dose adjustments for many medications to prevent toxicity or therapeutic failure [14,15]. Hospitalized and critically ill patients often require frequent adjustments in drugs and doses due to their unstable condition, adverse effects, hospital-acquired complications, and diagnostic uncertainties [16,17]. However, inappropriate renal dose adjustment remains a common clinical challenge [18]. Studies indicate that prescribers frequently fail to consider renal function when adjusting dosages, which may lead to adverse drug reactions, prolonged hospital stays, mortality and worsening renal function [19–24]. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, prolonging the dosing interval, or both which can be achieved through the implementation of trainings and local guidance [25,26]. In addition to renal drug dose adjustment, pre-treatment hydration with saline has demonstrated the most consistent benefits, whereas sodium loading and pharmacological interventions have been less effective [27,28].

Despite established guidelines for renal dose modification, adherence is often suboptimal due to a lack of awareness, experience, or access to dosing tools. Polypharmacy, common in patients with CKD, further increases the risk of drug-drug interactions and nephrotoxicity [29]. Moreover, the burden of inappropriate dosing and its impact on clinical outcomes such as mortality, need for dialysis, and progression of renal disease is not well documented, particularly in low-resource settings.

In Ethiopia, where diagnostic and therapeutic resources are limited, the burden of renal disease is high, yet data on medication dosing practices and their impact on patient outcomes are scarce [30]. This study aimed to evaluate renal drug dose adjustment practices, assess associated patient outcomes, and identify predictors of poor outcomes among hospitalized patients with kidney disease in referral hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia. Findings from this study are expected to inform clinical decision-making and highlight the need for improved renal dosing practices in similar resource-constrained settings.

This study was conducted at Tibebe Ghion Specialized Hospital and Felege Hiwot Specialized Hospital in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Tibebe Ghion Hospital, a tertiary teaching facility with 450 beds (72 occupied by medical patients), features a modern ICU with 12 admission beds. Both hospitals serve patients referred from across the Amhara region; offer a modern ICU and dialysis centre and comprehensive outpatient and inpatient services.

An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from December 01, 2023- February 29, 2024.

Patients with AKI, AKI on CKD and CKD who were admitted to the medical ward during the year 2023 and have their follow-up and or end-of-life care at TGSH and FHSH were included. Patients who have been on dialysis and those with incomplete data were excluded.

The patient treatment outcome (poor = 1, good = 0) was the outcome variable.

Renal drug dose adjustment practice, socio-demographic variables such as age and sex, diagnosis at admission, severity and type of kidney disease, degree of proteinuria, renal drug dose adjustment practice, number and type of medications used, duration of stay in the hospital, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were studied.

Renal drug dose adjustment practice: The clinical practices of optimizing doses of drugs that are metabolized, excreted, or pose a burden on the kidney to avoid toxicities. Practice was measured based on the FDAs renal dose adjustment guideline which should use the Cockcroft-Gault Equation (https://globalrph.com/renal/) is the application preferably used for this case [31]. Compliance is defined by the scientific and proper application of drug dose adjustments.

CKD- Cockcroft-Gault Equation:An internationally accepted formula for eGFR calculation for renal drug dose adjustment calculated as (140 − age) × body weight/plasma creatinine × 72 (×0.85 if female).

Comorbidity: The presence of any significant concurrent or past disease in addition to kidney disease which involves organs other than the kidneys but which may also be responsible for the kidney such as diabetes mellitus, Heart Failure, hypertension and stroke.

Partial drug dose adjustment: drug dose adjustment made to one or more medications that is not consistently applied to all prescribed drugs.

Poor patient outcome: When patients develop renal and/or systemic complications, further deterioration of the underlying disease characterized by declining eGFR, cardiovascular metabolic, bone and mineral disorders, need for dialysis, or death [32,33].

Poor treatment response:Complete or partial loss of responsiveness to a drug meant to treat an underlying illness as a result of a reduction in serum drug levels secondary to renal drug dose adjustment.

Kidney disease:The presence of kidney damage or a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2for three months or more, regardless of the cause which can manifest as either CKD or acute kidney injury AKI), or both.

Acute kidney Injury:Acute kidney injury that fulfills KDIGO criteria that is increasing in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL or more within 48 hours OR Increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline or more within the last 7 days OR Urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.

CKD:decreased eGFR to < 60 ml/min/m2 of body surface area.

Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease: The development of renal function detoriaration in a patient with established CKD.

eGFR:calculated based on serum creatinine with CKD-EPI equation. AKI on CKD- a rapid progression of kidney in a patient with established CKD.

Creatinine:An indirect assessment tool of renal function measured from the patient’s serum.

The proportion of renal drug dose adjustment a previous prevalence study done in the Amhara region including Tibebe Ghion Specialized Hospital (TGSH) is found to be 48.8% [34]. Hence, calculated sample size was 403 after adding a 5% patient chart loss rate. Then, systematic random sampling method was used to enroll study participants. As the estimated number of patients admitted to TGSH and Felege Hiwot Specialized Hospital (FHSH) in 2023 was around 800, every other patient was considered in the data collection procedure (k = N/n= 800/403 ~ 2). From total participants, 245 (60.7%) participants were from TGSH while the remaining 159(29.3%) were from FHSH.

Data was collected from patient’s chart evaluation using an electronic checklist system. Trained interns and nurses used the Kobo collect data collection tool installed on their smartphones, to collect data within the data collection time frame. The tool was developed the Kobo collect tool after took a virtual training on the subject matter. The data included the socio-demographic characteristics of patients including sex and age, relevant clinical (reason for admission, underlying disease severity, severity and cause of kidney disease defined by the stage and type of AKI/CKD, medications used, and duration of stay in the hospital), and laboratory (serum creatinine, GFR, proteinuria) information related to renal drug dose adjustment and patient outcome.

Data was collected by five data collectors including nurses, interns, and resident doctors after one day training given. Data collection was supervised by trained internal medicine residents and the principal investigator. The principal investigator checked the collected data and assesses any incomplete documents and performs data cleaning and check for the quality of data before entry. A Pretest using a sample of 10 patients was done and presented to advisors for quality assurance.

After data was collected; it was coded on a pre-arranged code sheet by the investigator. Data entry and cleansing was done using Epi data version 3.1., then exported to SPSS Version 27.5 for analysis. The descriptive analysis such as simple frequencies and proportions was done and presented using texts, tables, bar graphs, and pie charts. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to assess the relationship between dependent and independent variables at a p-value less than 0.25 and 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval respectively. Logistic regression model’s goodness-of-fit was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test.

A total of 384 patients’ charts with 95.3% of response rate were analyzed. The median age of participants was 40 years with interquartile range (IQR) of 20–60 years. The sex distribution was nearly equal, with a slight predominance of males (50.5%) over females (49.5%). The median duration of in-hospital stay was determined to be 5 days, with IQR spanning from 4 to 8 days.

A notable, 283 (73.7%) patients had comorbidities. The most commonly identified comorbidities were infection, hypertension, type 2 DM, heart failure, and stroke. Among all, 37 participants (9.6%) have used vasopressors, mainly Adrenaline (6.5%) while 24 participants (6.3%) were on mechanical ventilators. The predominant renal condition observed was AKI, encompassing a substantial majority of patients 365 (95.1%). The remaining participants presented with CKD.

Notably, 118(30.7%) of patients were classified as AKI Stage I, 134 (34.9%) as stage II and 132(34.4%) as Stage III. Further analysis of the etiology of AKI demonstrated that, 26.5% of cases were attributed to pre-renal factors, 274(61.2%) to intrinsic renal causes, and 2.3% to post-renal factors. Differing levels of proteinuria were observed in 204(53.1%) of patients (Table1).

Over three quarters, 296(77.1%) of patients utilized two or more drugs requiring renal drug dose adjustment of which 93 (24.2%) were prescribed two, 61 (15.9%), three, 64 (16.7%) four, and a 78 (20.3%) were utilizing five or more drugs necessitating DDA.

Complete guideline-based DDA was implemented only for 89(23.2%) of patients, while partial adjustments were made to 129(33.6%) patients and a significant 166(43.2%) of participants received no DDA to their drug prescriptions. Among medications that need drug dose adjustment, Metoclopramide, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, Vancomycin, Insulin, and Cefepime were found to be most poorly adjusted (Fig.1).

In this study, a significant proportion 244(63.5%) of patients experienced improvement and were discharged under favorable conditions. However, 140(36.5%), 95% CI: 31.5% − 41.5%) of individuals faced worsened outcomes, which encompassed a range of scenarios such as the necessity for dialysis, referrals due to complications, departures against medical advice prompted by poor prognoses, or unfortunate instances of mortality (Table2).

In this study, both bivariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with poor outcomes among the participants. The examined variables included were patient’s age, sex, presence of comorbidity, stage of AKI, and type of AKI, proteinuria, mechanical ventilation use, vasopressor use, duration of hospitalization, renal status at discharge, the practice of renal DDA and the number of medications requiring drug dose adjustment.

In the Bivariable analysis, Age, type of AKI, stage of AKI, mechanical ventilator use, practice of renal DDA, number of medications that need DDA, Presence of comorbidities, duration of hospital stay, presence of proteinuria, and degree of proteinuria had p-value of < 0.25 and candidate variables for final model. Notably, the multivariable analysis revealed that the following variables have significant associations with poor patient outcomes at p-value of < 0.05 with 95%CI. These factors encompassed partial renal drug dose adjustment practice (AOR = 2.76, 95% CI:1.14–6.71), no adjustments (AOR = 10.15, 95% CI: 3.88–26.57), mechanical ventilator use (AOR = 2.90, 95% CI:1.69–12.19), vasopressor use (AOR = 10.01, 95% CI: 4.27–22.73), presence of comorbidity(AOR = 3.42, 95% CI:1.56–7.51), advanced stage of AKI: stage II (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI:1.15–5.45) and stage III (AOR = 2.92, 95%CI: 1.29–6.57), intrinsic type of AKI(AOR = 3.56, 95%CI:1.57–8.06) and age above 60 years(AOR = 5.50, 95%CI: 2.26–13.41) (Table3).

This study revealed that a substantial proportion (63.5%) of patients, experienced improvement during their hospitalization, leading to favorable discharge conditions. This positive outcome suggests effective medical management and interventions for the majority of the study population. However, a significant subset, constituting 36.5% of individuals, faced worsened outcomes. These adverse scenarios included the necessity for dialysis, referrals due to complications, departures against medical advice prompted by poor prognoses, and unfortunate instances of mortality. The result of this study revealed improved patient outcomes as compared to the very high level of mortality (45% and 62.9% risk for community and hospital-acquired AKIs) demonstrated in a study conducted in the United Kingdom and findings a multinational, multicenter study that found 60.3% in-hospital mortality and 13.8% risk of dialysis dependence at hospital discharge [21,35–38]. The later study however evaluated critically ill patients admitted to ICU. The results of this study can therefore be interpreted for an alarmingly significant rate of mortality, complications, and overall poor outcome in hospitalized patients with kidney disease.

The research findings provide valuable insights into the adherence to renal dosing guidelines among patients requiring drug dose adjustments, allowing for a critical evaluation in light of the hypothesis that renal drug dose adjustment should be made on a regular and scientific basis [15,19,20]. The substantial polypharmacy burden in this study, with over two-thirds of participants taking two or more renally adjusted medications, aligns with findings from a multi-institutional regional study in the Amhara region [39].

The significant proportion of participants receiving no (43.2%) or partial (33.6%) renal dose adjustments raises concerns about adherence to guidelines, with non-adherence rates comparable to prior local and international studies (up to 69%) [35,40,41]. The inappropriate adjustments observed for specific medications, such as Metoclopramide, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, Vancomycin, Insulin, and Cefepime, further emphasize the need for continuous education and reinforcement of the scientific basis behind renal drug dose adjustments as these classes of medications are highly utilized in hospitalized patients owing to comorbidities and complications that necessitate their use. This result is supported by studies done at Tikur Anbessa and referral hospitals in the Amhara region which showed antibiotics, anti-emetics, and antidiabetic medications being the most unadjusted drugs [39].

Apart from the concerning level of poor drug dose adjustment, the findings of this study show a strong association between inappropriate drug dose adjustment and poor patient outcome. This association has not been evaluated in other studies so far and this may serve as an entry point for further research and practical considerations. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was also undertaken to identify factors associated with poor outcomes other than inappropriate drug dose adjustment among participants with acute kidney injury (AKI).

Age categories exhibited significant associations with patient outcomes. Increased age had a notable association with poor emphasizing the vulnerability of the elderly population in the context of renal health. This finding agrees with the KDIGO and other risk prediction models which present advanced age ( > 65 years) as being a major determinant of poor outcomes [6,42,43]. Advanced age is associated with progressive nephron loss and hence rapid progression of disease and increased risk for complications. In addition to this, old age may be associated with poor drug metabolism predisposing patients to poor adverse effects from medications.

Intrinsic AKI and higher stages (II and III) were associated with poorer outcomes, highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention. This aligns with findings from a recent USA study linking severe AKI (Stage III) and proteinuria to worse outcomes [44]. While other studies have highlighted proteinuria, this research, including pre-operative patients, did not find significant associations for Stage II AKI or its causes, potentially due to the impact of malnutrition and infections on perioperative outcomes. Consistent with our findings, a study in Bangkok, Thailand, also linked AKI severity to poorer outcomes [45]. This association therefore reveals that severity of AKI and the underlying cause are prominent predictors of outcome in medical patients as compared to proteinuria.

Furthermore, vasopressor use of any type (Adrenaline, Noradrenaline, or Dopamine) and mechanical ventilator use is also significantly associated with poor patient outcomes. This finding is further supported by multiple studies showing poor outcomes in patients with kidney disease who required vasopressors and mechanical ventilator support [46–48]. This can be scientifically explained by the fact that patients requiring these advanced bundles of care tend to have single or multiple organ failure portending poor prognosis to the patient.

The presence of comorbidities was another influential factor, exhibiting a significant association with poor outcomes. This is in line with a study conducted in Botswana, which revealed that hospitalized patients with kidney disease having comorbidities like Hypertension, Diabetes, and infections had poor outcomes as compared to those having none [43,49]. Another study conducted in the USA proved this association in that not only the presence of comorbidities but also the severity and number of comorbidities were associated with poor patient outcomes [50]. These findings underscore the need for a holistic approach to managing renal patients, recognizing both renal-specific and broader health factors to optimize patient care. While valuable, the results should be interpreted within the context of the study’s limitations, particularly its cross-sectional design and limited setting, which prevent causal inferences.

This study found that over one-third of hospitalized patients experienced poor outcomes, defined by mortality, dialysis needs, or life-threatening complications. Key factors linked to these outcomes included age over 60, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes), advanced stages of AKI, and poor drug dose adjustments; over two-thirds of medications were mismanaged. The use of mechanical ventilators and vasopressors also correlated with poorer outcomes. To address these issues, we recommend developing institution-based protocols, training healthcare professionals on renal drug adjustments, and engaging policymakers to improve patient outcomes.

The authors would like to express their deepest gratitude to Bahir Dar University, the study participants, and the data collectors, without whom completing this task would have been impossible.
