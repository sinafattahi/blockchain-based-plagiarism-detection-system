Right hemicolectomy with Complete Mesocolic Excision (CME) and Central Vascular Ligation (CVL) is a complex surgical procedure, partly due to the significant anatomical variability of the superior mesenteric vessels. Three-dimensional (3D) vascular reconstruction, through segmentation—a process that groups pixels with similar characteristics into segments—is a technique that enables the three-dimensional visualization of blood vessels from medical images, usually obtained through CT or magnetic resonance imaging. 3D vascular reconstruction of the superior mesenteric vessels obtained from preoperative images of surgical patients enhances preoperative anatomical understanding, making surgery safer, especially for young surgeons approaching this technique. The primary outcome of this study was to obtain an objective score reflecting surgical residents’ understanding of the patient’s vascular anatomy from 3D reconstructions of CT images. The secondary outcome was the subjective feedback from senior colorectal surgeons regarding pre-operative use of 3D vascular reconstructions.

A total of 20 patients who underwent right hemicolectomy from 01/10/2023 to 30/09/2024 were included in the study. For each patient, 3D vascular reconstruction was obtained from preoperative CT images. Four surgical residents and two experienced colorectal surgeons were recruited. The residents’ understanding of each patient’s vascular anatomy was assessed after they looked at the standard pre-operative CT images first and then at their 3D reconstructions respectively. Moreover, the senior colorectal surgeons’ opinion on the use of pre-operative 3D vascular reconstruction was assessed.

Overall, 3D reconstructions significantly improved residents’ anatomical understanding compared to baseline testing (6.71 ± 2.27 vs. 5.26 ± 1.97;p< 0.0001). For three out of four residents examined, 3D vascular reconstruction was statistically superior to standard CT. Colorectal surgeons also gave positive feedback to the use of pre-operative 3D reconstruction.

Three-dimensional vascular reconstruction models may help improve surgical trainees’ anatomical understanding of mesenteric vascular anatomy compared to conventional CT image interpretation. 3D models may be a useful adjunct to 2D imaging for residents’ training and pre-operative planning of CME surgery. More studies are needed to further evaluate the impact of using pre-operative 3D vascular reconstruction.

Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA):Using contrast agents along with advanced imaging techniques like time-of-flight and phase-contrast MRA, high-resolution 3D images of the mesenteric vessels can be obtained. MRA is particularly useful in patients with contraindications to CT imaging, such as those with renal impairment.

Fusion Imaging:Fusion imaging combines data from different imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI) to create a more comprehensive view.

Intraoperative Navigation Systems:The integration of intraoperative navigation with 3D imaging is becoming increasingly popular. These systems can superimpose preoperative 3D models onto the surgical field, providing real-time guidance during surgery. By tracking the position of surgical instruments, these systems help ensure that noble structures are carefully preserved during the procedure. This technology enhances surgical accuracy and minimizes the risk of inadvertent injury.

The primary outcome of the study was assessing the impact of 3D reconstructions on the overall anatomical understanding of surgical trainees regarding the upper mesenteric vascular district. The secondary outcome of the study was assessing the subjective improvement of surgeon’s intraoperative performances derived from routine use of 3D reconstructions in pre-operative planning.

A multiple-choice questionnaire consisting of 10 items on the anatomy of the superior mesenteric vessels (Fig.2) and a satisfaction questionnaire consisting of 4 questions, with answers numbered from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5 (Fig.3), were used.

During the first phase of the study, after viewing both 2D and 3D images, the operating surgeon performed the procedure and later completed a questionnaire about the vascular anatomy of the right colon and a subjective satisfaction questionnaire.

In the second phase of the study, pre-operative CT images of each enrolled patient, identified by a randomly assigned numeric code, were shown to surgical residents. After viewing the images, residents answered a questionnaire regarding the vascular anatomy of the superior mesenteric vessels. In the third phase, surgical residents proceeded to view 3D reconstructions, identified by a randomly assigned numeric code, of each enrolled patient. The numeric (2D) and alphabetical (3D) codes were unrelated. After being shown each reconstruction, the surgical residents completed the anatomy questionnaire again. In the fourth phase, the questionnaires completed by the residents were analyzed. A score of + 1 was given for each answer matching the operating surgeon's answers on the anatomy questionnaire; for each answer that did not match, a score of −1 was given. In the fifth and final phase of the study, the satisfaction questionnaires about 3D reconstruction completed by the operating surgeons were analyzed. The questionnaires were administered and collected using Google Forms (Google LLC-Mountain View, California). The scores obtained from the questionnaires were stored in a database on Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation-Redmond, Washington) and subsequently analyzed using SPSS Statistics software (IBM-Armonk, New York). The data were analyzed using the paired sample t-test. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the local ethics committee. Data of each individual patient enrolled in the study have been and will be protected in accordance with Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30 June 2003. The study was conducted in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with European Union good clinical practice, safeguarding the legal rights to protection of sensitive data.

Of the 28 patients recruited in this study, 8 were excluded as their CT images did not meet the previously described criteria. A total of 20 patients were thus included in the study. A total of 160 questionnaires were administered to residents: 80 questionnaires for 2D images (20 for each resident) and 80 questionnaires for 3D images (20 for each resident). First, the scores of the 3D and 2D (vascular anatomy) questionnaires (for the residents) were compared. It was observed that in 49 out of 80 cases, the scores obtained from the 3D questionnaires were higher than those from the 2D questionnaires. In 16 out of 80 cases, the scores were similar, while in 15 out of 80 cases, the scores from the 2D questionnaires were higher (Fig.4).

Analyzing the overall score obtained by the trainees for the two groups (3D vs. 2D), we found that the aggregate score was 537/800 for the 3D group and 421/800 for the 2D group. The overall mean score of the questionnaires in the 3D group was significantly higher than that in the 2D group (6.71 ± 2.27 vs. 5.26 ± 1.97;p< 0.0001) (Fig.5).

The average scores recorded by each resident in the 3D group were consistently higher than those in the comparison group. This difference was statistically significant for 3 out of 4 residents (Resident 2: 8.15 ± 1.69 vs. 5.80 ± 1.54,p< 0.0001; Resident 3: 4.45 ± 1.57 vs. 3.70 ± 1.38,p= 0.032; Resident 4: 7.85 ± 1.31 vs. 5.50 ± 1.96,p< 0.0001) (Fig.6).

The senior colorectal surgeons gave average positive feedback to the use of 3D vascular reconstruction for pre-operative planning on the satisfaction questionnaires (Fig.7).

Right hemicolectomy with CME/CVL technique is being increasingly recognized as the reference surgical procedure for right colon tumors starting from stage cT2 [11]. American and European oncological societies, however, still won’t recognize it as the standard technique, unlike what happened with the Holy plane and TME for rectal surgery. This is partly due to its technical complexity but also because it is associated with a higher risk of vascular injuries to the superior mesenteric vessels. Improving pre-operative anatomical understanding with 3D reconstructions could help reduce the risk of intra-operative hemorrhagic complications, avoiding iatrogenic injuries to vascular structures with high anatomical variability. In our work, we highlight an increase in the average score obtained by trainees in the 3D questionnaires compared to the 2D questionnaires (6.71 ± 2.7 vs. 5.26 ± 1.97,p< 0.0001). Analyzing the answers given by each trainee, we highlighted how in 3 out of 4 cases, 3D reconstructions improved the residents’ comprehension of mesenteric vascular anatomy compared to 2D interpretation alone. Compared to prior studies, our findings confirm the additional value of 3D models in colorectal surgery, in line with Mari et al. [12], Chen et al. [13], Fletcher et al. [14] and Romano et al. [15], who demonstrated benefits in anatomical understanding and intraoperative outcomes. A summary comparison of these studies is presented in Table1.

Furthermore, the utility of 3D reconstruction is not limited to colorectal surgery. For instance, recent research has shown its application in esophagogastric surgery, where 3D printed models improve intraoperative navigation and precision in robotic-assisted procedures [16]. Similar techniques are also being explored in pancreatic [17] and hepatobiliary [18] surgery, further emphasizing the evolving role of 3D technologies in modern surgical practice.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our study was intended as a preliminary investigation to evaluate the feasibility and educational value of 3D reconstructions in the context of CME. We acknowledge that the number of patients and surgical trainees included in this study is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. We agree that future studies with larger sample sizes, including residents from multiple training levels and institutions, would be valuable to further validate our results and improve the external validity. In our study, we examined the effect of 3D visualization in trainees who had a limited operative experience with CME. We did not assess whether young surgeons who regularly perform this procedure would have achieved similar results. Furthermore, we only demonstrated the trainees’ ability to identify the vessels on 3D reconstructions with a multiple-choice questionnaire, and not their ability to recognize such vessels during surgery. While this study focused on preoperative anatomical comprehension, we recognize that demonstrating a clinical benefit requires objective intraoperative outcome measures. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether 3D vascular models lead to improved surgical performance, such as reduced operative time, decreased complication rates, or enhanced precision. Although manual segmentation of 2D images is extremely flexible and is always applicable, even in case of suboptimal CT scans, it is time-consuming, and its accuracy is operator dependent. The time required for 3D vascular reconstruction with manual segmentation typically ranges from 30 min to 2 h, while automatic segmentation can reduce this time to approximately 5 to 30 min. The differences in time are mainly due to manual segmentation requiring the operator to individually trace the blood vessels, which is time-consuming and depends on the complexity of the anatomy. In contrast, automatic segmentation uses algorithms to identify and delineate the vessels quickly, although it may still require some manual corrections to ensure accuracy, especially in cases where the algorithm struggles with variations in vessel shape or quality of the imaging data. Luzon et al. highlighted that the semi-automatic segmentation technique, in 91.7% of cases, did not include all mesenteric branches relevant to the surgeon and could cause considerable confusion at surgery [19]. If 3D models are to be introduced into clinical practice, then segmentation should be automatic to ensure rapid, accurate, and reproducible results. While the positive feedback of senior colorectal surgeons is encouraging, we acknowledge the importance of incorporating objective secondary outcomes to provide a more robust evaluation. Future studies could include objective measures such as comparing intraoperative complication rates, operative times, and other relevant surgical outcomes between cases with and without the use of 3D reconstructions.

This work demonstrates that 3D models, produced using open-source software, could be a useful tool for surgical residents to expand their knowledge about vascular anatomy and in the pre-operative study of patients. Given our observations of improved anatomical understanding using 3D models, a prospective study on the use of such reconstructions in CME could help determine if these improvements are also transferable to surgical outcomes. In this regard, expert colorectal surgeons who participated in this study expressed satisfaction with the pre-operative use of 3D reconstructions. Further studies will be needed to assess the objective benefit provided by 3D reconstructions during surgery.

We extend our sincere appreciations to the General Surgery Units of Fornaroli Hospital and Busto Arsizio Hospital for their contribution and continuous support through our data collection process.
