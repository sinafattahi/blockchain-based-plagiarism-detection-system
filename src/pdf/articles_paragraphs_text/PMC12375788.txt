Modifying the gut microbiome, also known as bacteriotherapy, is a key strategy that uses probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics to reduce inflammation and fight infection and colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Various food sources, particularly those rich inLactobacillusspecies, are well-recognized for their probiotic properties. Edible mushrooms are rich with their nutrient-dense composition, including carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, minerals, vitamins, and lipids, which stand out as a promising bio-source for several biological uses. In this study, four probiotic strains were isolated and identified from food samples:Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus),L. pentosus,L. plantarum, andL. paracasei. Then the prebiotic and antioxidant properties of crude and polysaccharide extracts were assessed from two edible mushrooms,Agaricus bisporus(brown) andPleurotus ostreatus(oyster). Using the phenol-sulfuric acid method, the ethanol extract ofP. ostreatusexhibited the highest yields of total carbohydrates and reducing sugars (6.14 and 3.15 mg/mL, respectively). Among the mushroom extracts, the polysaccharide fromA. bisporusdemonstrated the strongest radical scavenging activity (93.73%), with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.19 mg/mL, measured using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The prebiotic properties of the mushroom extracts were evaluated by their ability to promote probiotic growth and inhibit pathogenic bacteria. The polysaccharide extracts fromA. bisporusandP. ostreatussignificantly stimulated the growth ofL. paracasei(1.99 and 2.04 nm, respectively). Additionally, the cell-free supernatant fromL. acidophiluscultured with theA. bisporuspolysaccharide extract exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity, producing a 36.33 mm inhibition zone against the pathogenL. monocytogenes. These findings demonstrate that polysaccharides fromA. bisporus and P. ostreatusare promising candidates for functional food development. These extracts offer a multifaceted approach to promoting gut health and reducing oxidative stress through selectively stimulating beneficial Lactobacillus species while inhibiting the growth of pathogens and exerting significant antioxidant effects.

In recent years, the human gut microbiota has been the topic of intensive investigation, with a growing understanding of the different species and their functions1. Various variables, such as probiotics (indicating bacteria that boost the microbiome), prebiotics (food compositions rich in oligosaccharides or polysaccharides), and synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics), can activate the microbiota in favor of host health. The study of probiotics is critical for understanding the health advantages of gut microbiota2. Bacteriotherapy, or modification of the gut microbiome with probiotics, prebiotics, or symbiotics, has a considerable influence on immunomodulation, inflammation reduction, as well as infection and colonization with harmful bacteria3. Probiotics are living organisms that, when consumed in the right doses, can improve the health of their hosts. The antipathogenic mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria include immune system activation and regulation, antagonistic action against pathogenic bacteria, temporary gut colonization, and metabolite production4. TheLactobacillusgenus has received the most attention among the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for the purpose of choosing probiotic species and strains5. Polysaccharides resist decomposition and digestion in saliva, gastric, and small intestinal conditions, presenting a challenge for absorption by the body. This is attributed to the limited number of polysaccharide digestive enzymes (17) encoded by the human genome, with the additional enzymes necessary for polysaccharide digestion being encoded by microbes and their genomes in the human gut6,7. Dysbiosis is the result of an unbalanced gut microbiota, which results in disease and microbial infection. Prebiotics are indigestible dietary ingredients (such as mushrooms) that can act directly as antioxidants or immunomodulators or indirectly by selectively stimulating the gut microbiota to grow and thus benefiting their hosts8. Prebiotics are mostly composed of oligosaccharides and fiber. According to a new trend in food science and technology, prebiotics have been linked to modulating the human gut microbiota and reducing the risk of diabetes, obesity, and tumors9. The effects of pathogenic microbes during dysbiosis, probiotics, and prebiotics on human intestinal epithelial cells were presented in Fig.1. Mushrooms are rich in polysaccharides like chitin and β-glucans, as well as galactans, making them an excellent source of prebiotics10,11. Mushrooms serve as prebiotics, promoting the formation of the gut microbiota and so providing health advantages to the host. Mushrooms have a long tradition of use in many countries. They are foods full of amino acids, different minerals, enzymes, and physiologically active polysaccharides. Mushrooms have over a hundred different therapeutic properties. Recently, there has been a significant increase in interest in the antioxidant properties of mushrooms and their polysaccharides12. Mushrooms have been reported as useful in preventing diseases such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, microbial infections, inflammations, allergies, cancer, and have hepatoprotective properties13–16. The nutritional value ofPleurotusspp. has been well known; according to recent studies, the genus is low in fat, rich in fiber, and has nutritional levels of carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals that are significantly higher than those of other resources17.Ganoderma lucidium(GL) is a well-known macrofungal that is shown to lower obesity in rats via altering gut microbiota composition18. By considerably increasing the numbers of lactic acid-producing bacteria and improving the intestine’s health, the use ofAgaricus bisporusmushrooms modifies the composition, performance, and morphology of the intestinal microbiota, as well as antioxidant levels in turkey poults18. While the general benefits of edible mushrooms are known, critical gaps in understanding still exist. Specifically, few studies have directly compared the bioactivity of crude versus purified polysaccharide extracts from common edible mushrooms likeA. bisporusandP. ostreatus. Furthermore, the strain-specific synergistic effects between these prebiotics and differentLactobacillusspecies against key human pathogens remain underexplored. Therefore, this study was designed to systematically evaluate and compare the prebiotic, antipathogenic, and antioxidant properties of crude versus polysaccharide extracts fromA. bisporusandP. ostreatus. By elucidating these specific bioactivities, this study aims to advance the understanding of how these common edible mushrooms can be utilized as functional food components to modulate the gut microbiome, inhibit enteric pathogens, and mitigate oxidative stress.

The effect of pathogenic microbial infection and the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of probiotics and prebiotics on intestinal epithelium.

The study was conducted in a multi-step process. First, potential probioticLactobacillusstrains were isolated from 100 different food samples and subsequently identified to the species level using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Four distinct isolates were selected for further analysis. In parallel, crude and polysaccharide extracts were prepared fromA. bisporusandP. ostreatusmushrooms. These extracts were then biochemically characterized by quantifying their total carbohydrate and reducing sugar content, and their antioxidant capacity was assessed using DPPH and ABTS assays. To evaluate prebiotic potential, the mushroom extracts were supplemented into the growth media of the previously identifiedLactobacillusstrains. Probiotic growth stimulation was determined by measuring the change in optical density. Finally, the cell-free supernatants from theLactobacilluscultures that had been supplemented with the mushroom extracts were collected and tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria19,20.

All used chemicals were analytical grade from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA and Fluka (Darmstadt, Germany). The media used in this study were commercially available as dehydrated media from Oxoid, UK and Himedia, India. Instruments used in this study included Spectrophotometry INNO-M (LTEK Co., Ltd Instruments, Sunil Technopia 903-ho, 555, Republic of Korea 13215), Incubator (Heraeus, D-63450, Germany), Centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810 R, Germany), Rotary evaporator (Yamato BM 100, Japan), Homogenizer (T 25 digital ULTRA-TURRAX®IKA, labortechnik, Staufen, Germany), lyophilizer (TELSTAR, ORTODOS-50, Spain), MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker daltonik MALDI biotyper, Germany), and Stomacher (Seward, UK).

A total of 100 food samples of the most consumed types of yoghurt, cheese, buttermilk, pickles, and honey were randomly purchased from various markets in Alexandria, Egypt. All the collected samples were transported within two hours in an ice box to the laboratory for processing. Twenty-five g of each purchased food sample were mixed with 225 mL of buffered peptone water (BPW) in a sterile stomacher bag and homogenized using a stomacher (Seward, UK). This mixture was considered a 10−1dilution. Then, tenfold serial dilutions of 10−2, 10−3, and 10−4were performed using 9 mL Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth tubes. One mL from each homogenized food sample and each dilution (10−2, 10−3, and 10−4) was streaked onto the surface of an MRS agar plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under anaerobic conditions using an anaerogen gas pack and anaerobic jar. After incubation, individual colonies were selected and transferred into sterile MRS broth tubes. The selected colonies were purified by streaking onto the surface of a sterile MRS plate using a sterile bacteriological loop. The isolates were then examined according to their colony morphology, catalase reaction, and Gram stain21. Isolates that appeared as round, opaque, creamy, or milky white colonies on the surface of MRS agar plates and then, when viewed under the microscope after Gram staining, appeared as gram positive rods and were catalase negative were identified using MALDI-TOF biotype. Then, the stocks of identified LAB were kept at −80◦C in cryovials of MRS broth containing 20% (v/v) glycerol.

Four strains of prebiotic lactobacilli (L. acidophilus,L. pentosus,L. plantarum, andL. paracasei) and five pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus(ATCC 25923),Escherichia coli(ATCC 25922),Shigella dysenteriae,Listeria monocytogenes(ATCC 13932) and methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA)) were cultivated in an appropriate medium, MRS medium, Nutrient agar (NA) or Nutrient broth (NB).

Two kinds of edible mushrooms were purchased from the Egyptian local market, the brownA. bisporusandP. ostreatus. For crude extract, 500 g of fresh mushroom fruiting bodies were washed, homogenized, and extracted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C22. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected and filtered. About 500 g of edible mushrooms were washed and dried at 105 °C overnight for polysaccharide extraction, then completely mixed for 5 min in a blender. Each sample was divided into 10 g and placed in separate test tubes. All materials were extracted using 30 mL of a 1:4 v/v combination of distilled water and ethanol 95%. The mushrooms were shaken for 4 h at 80 °C and 150 rotations per minute. Then, it was centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 25 ± 2 °C for 15 min, and all supernatants were then maintained at 4 °C for total carbohydrate and total reducing sugar analyses20. To obtain the dried fractions, all mushroom constituents were lyophilized and stored at 4 °C until required.

The phenol-sulfuric acid technique was used to determine the carbohydrate concentration of the crude and ethanolic mushroom extracts23. In this experiment, a mixture of 0.25 mL of mushroom sample, 1.25 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 0.25 mL of 5% phenol was heated to 100 °C for 5 min, then cooled at 25 ± 2 °C. The total carbohydrate contents were measured at an absorbance of 490 nm, and a standard and blank sample were analyzed using glucose and distilled water, respectively, instead of mushroom samples.

All mushroom extracts were determined for total reducing sugar using a 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay according to24. After the extraction process, each extracted mushroom sample was centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 25 ± 2 °C for 15 min. A supernatant aliquot of one mL was mixed with one mL of DNS reagent and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling the mixture to 25 ± 2 °C, the reducing sugar was measured using spectrophotometry at 540 nm absorbance. The standard and blank samples were prepared and analyzed in the same way, except for adding one mL of glucose to the standard sample and one mL of distilled water to the blank sample.

Mushroom extracts were investigated for their antioxidant capacity in two different assays, namely, the ABTS+and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities.

The scavenging activity of the ethanol and water extracts from mushrooms on DPPH radicals was measured according to the method of25with some modifications. An aliquot of 0.5 mL of 0.1 mM DPPH radical (Sigma) in methanol was added to a test tube with one mL of mushroom crude and polysaccharide extracts of different concentrations (1.5 to 9 mg/mL). Methanol or water was used instead of the mushroom sample as a control, and Ascorbic acid was used as a standard. The reaction mixture was vortex mixed at 25 ± 2 °C, and the absorbance (Abs) was determined immediately after mixing by measuring at 520 nm with a spectrophotometer. The scavenging activity percent (SA%) on DPPH radicals was calculated by Eq. (1).

Another method for determining the free radical scavenging activity of mushroom crude and polysaccharide extracts was the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay26. ABTS+cation radical was produced by the reaction between 7 mM ABTS+in water and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate (1:1), stored in the dark at 25 ± 2 °C for 12–16 h before use. The ABTS+solution was then diluted with methanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.700 at 734 nm. After the addition of 5 µL of plant extract to 3.995 mL of diluted ABTS+solution, the absorbance was measured 30 min after the initial mixing. An appropriate solvent blank was run in each assay. All the measurements were carried out at least three times. Percent inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm was calculated using the formula, Eq.2.

where AB is absorbance of ABTS radical + methanol; AA is absorbance of ABTS radical + sample extract/standard. Ascorbic acid was used as standard substance.

L. acidophilus,L. pentosus,L. plantarum, andL. paracaseiwere cultured at 37 °C for 48 h in MRS broth (used as the control), compared with culture medium supplemented with 2.5 and 5 mg/mL of each mushroom extract and a commercial prebiotic compound such as inulin. After incubation, the cultures were quantified by measuring the optical cell density using spectrophotometry at 620 nm27.

To evaluate the antipathogenic potential of the synbiotic combinations, a three-step method was employed. First, prebiotic cultures were prepared by growing eachLactobacillusstrain for 48 h at 37 °C in MRS broth supplemented with 5 mg/mL of each mushroom extract. Second, the cultures were centrifuged (8000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min), and the cell-free supernatant, containing metabolites produced by the probiotics from fermenting the mushroom extracts, was collected. Third, pathogenic bacteria (L. monocytogenes,E. coli,S. dysenteriae,S. aureus, and MRSA) were cultured on Muller-Hinton agar (MHA) plates. Sterile filter paper discs were impregnated with 20 µL of the collected supernatant and placed on the plates. Antimicrobial activity was determined by measuring the diameter of the clear zone of inhibition after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, inhibition efficiency was determined by comparing the diameter of the clear zone on the plate containing probiotic supernatant to that of the media lacking probiotics and mushroom extracts (negative control) and the culture containing a commercial prebiotic compound (positive control)28.

All quantitative experiments were performed in triplicate, and results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Group comparisons were performed using either an independent samples t-test (for two groups) or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (for more than two groups), using SPSS software (version 16.0). For antioxidant assays, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by fitting the data to a non-linear regression model using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0). In all analyses, a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

A total of 100 food samples examined, from yoghurt, cheese, buttermilk, pickles, and honey, summarized in Table1. Pickles yielded the highest percentage of LAB isolates (95.0%). This was followed by yoghurt samples (70.0%), which represented the highest percentage among the tested dairy products. Cheese samples were the least likely to yield LAB isolates (35.0%). No LAB isolates were recovered from any of the examined honey samples. Out of the 58 isolated LABs,L. pentosusandL. plantarumaccounted for 48.3% of all identified LAB isolates. Yoghurt was the only source ofL. paracaseiisolates in this study, with a percentage of 9.5%. Also,L. pentosuswas isolated only from pickle samples (79.0%).L. acidophilusisolates were recovered from yoghurt and buttermilk samples with percentages of 23.8% and 9.1%, respectively, whileL. plantarumwas isolated from cheese and buttermilk with percentages of 71.0% and 72.7%, respectively.

The crude and polysaccharide extracts were used for the determination of carbohydrates and reducing sugar amounts. As shown in Table2, the polysaccharides extract of oyster mushrooms had the highest carbohydrates and reducing sugars of 6.14 and 3.15 mg/mL, respectively.

Mushrooms are widely recognized for their antioxidant properties. In this study, two assays, DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging tests, were evaluated the antioxidative potential of crude and polysaccharide extracts from mushrooms in comparison to ascorbic acid. The results, illustrated in Fig.2a and c, indicate that the scavenging activity of these extracts is concentration-dependent. Notably, the polysaccharide extracts of both brown and oyster mushrooms exhibited significantly higher antioxidant activity than the crude extracts in the DPPH assay, with EC50values of 0.19 mg/mL and 0.31 mg/mL, respectively, as shown in Fig.2b. Similarly, when assessed using the ABTS assay, the polysaccharide extracts displayed IC50values of 0.315 mg/mL and 0.516 mg/mL, respectively, as depicted in Fig.2d.

Following the cultivation of lactobacilli with and without mushroom crude and polysaccharide extracts, the results were compared to inulin as a commercial prebiotic standard. Notably, cultivation with 2.5 mg/mL of polysaccharide extracts fromAgaricus bisporusandPleurotus ostreatusled to the highest growth stimulation ofL. paracasei, with values of 1.59 and 1.57, respectively, as shown in Fig.3a. Furthermore, the addition of 5 mg/mL of polysaccharide extracts significantly enhanced the prebiotic activity across all studied lactobacilli strains, as illustrated in Fig.3b. Among these, the polysaccharide extracts from brown and oyster mushrooms showed the highest stimulation ofL. paracaseigrowth, achieving values of 1.99 and 2.04, respectively.

The inhibition of pathogenic growth by prebiotic cultivations is presented in Fig.4(a-e). The culture media of LAB containing mushroom crude extracts, polysaccharides, or inulin demonstrated varying levels of antipathogenic effects. Among these,L. acidophiluscultured with mushroom extracts produced the largest clear zones ofL. monocytogenesinhibition when grown with the crude extract and polysaccharides ofA. bisporusand the polysaccharide ofP. ostreatus, measuring 30.00, 36.33, and 21.33 mm, respectively, as shown in Fig.4e. Following this,L. paracaseitreated with polysaccharide extracts ofA. bisporusandP. ostreatusagainstE. coliresulted in clear zones with diameters of 14.00 mm, as depicted in Fig.4c.

This study demonstrates that polysaccharide extracts fromA. bisporusandP. ostreatuspossess significant antioxidant, prebiotic, and antipathogenic properties, making them promising candidates for nutraceutical development. A key finding was that purification substantially enhanced these activities, with purified extracts consistently outperforming their crude counterparts.

The high carbohydrate and reducing sugar yields fromP. ostreatusalign with previous reports20. In the antioxidant assays, the purified extracts showed potent radical scavenging capacity. The IC50value for theA. bisporusextract against the DPPH radical was 0.19 mg/mL. This activity is comparable to the 0.38 mg/mL reported by Liu et al.29although it indicates lower potency than the 81.3 µg/mL reported by Elmastas et al.30. In contrast, theP. ostreatusextract exhibited a potent IC50of 0.31 mg/mL, which is nearly seven times more effective than the 2.14 mg/mL reported by Yan et al.12. Such variations in antioxidant capacity likely arise from differences in the specific mushroom strains, growing conditions, or extraction methodologies used across studies. Nevertheless, the strong ability of these extracts to neutralize free radicals supports their potential application as functional ingredients to mitigate oxidative stress, a key factor in inflammation and aging17,31.

The prebiotic potential of the mushroom extracts was confirmed by their ability to stimulate the growth ofLactobacillusstrains, particularly at higher concentrations. This finding is consistent with previous research demonstrating that mushroom-derived polysaccharides can be more effective prebiotics than conventional fibers like inulin3,20. The enhanced production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by the polysaccharide-fed lactobacilli further underscores this prebiotic activity. SCFAs are critical for maintaining gut homeostasis, supporting immune function, and inhibiting pathogens by lowering intestinal pH31,32. Therefore, these polysaccharides represent a promising tool to enhance digestive health and support colonic integrity, although in vivo studies are needed to confirm their impact on gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity3,18,33.

The potent antibacterial effect observed in this study can be attributed to a synergy between the LAB and mushroom polysaccharides. The antimicrobial effects of LAB are largely attributed to environmental acidification and the secretion of bacteriocins34,35. These findings suggested that the mushroom polysaccharides act as a prebiotic, stimulatingLactobacillusgrowth and thereby increasing the production of these inhibitory substances.

The most significant novel finding of this work is the potent, strain-specific synbiotic effect observed againstL. monocytogenes. Specifically, the supernatant fromL. acidophilusfortified withA. bisporuspolysaccharides demonstrated a powerful inhibitory activity that was not seen with other combinations. This suggests a highly specific interaction, whereA. bisporuspolysaccharides serve as an optimal prebiotic substrate forL. acidophilus, leading to the enhanced production of a potent cocktail of antimicrobial metabolites.

This efficacy can be attributed to a “multi-pronged attack” mechanism. Primarily, the fermentation of polysaccharides leads to the secretion of organic acids and bacteriocins, which create a low-pH environment hostile to pathogens36,37. Additionally, the production of SCFAs has been independently associated with reduced pathogen virulence and colonization36–38. This combined assault overwhelms the defenses ofL. monocytogenesfar more effectively than it does other pathogens. For instance, gram-negative bacteria likeE. coliandS. dysenteriaeare protected by an outer membrane, while the bacteriocins produced byL. acidophilusmay not be the primary target for other gram-positive pathogens likeS. aureusor MRSA39–42.

Our finding that this effect is highly strain-specific is strongly supported by the literature. While the results of this study align with Sawangwan et al.20who also reported inhibition of a pathogen (S. paratyphi) byL. acidophiluscultured with mushroom extracts, the higher efficacy in this study points to the uniqueness of the strain and substrate combination. This aligns perfectly with the conclusions of both Tejero-Sariñena et al.38and Burgos et al.43who have demonstrated that the antimicrobial and probiotic potential of LAB is dictated not by the species alone, but by the unique genetic makeup of an individual strain. The work by Burgos et al.43for example, showed thatL. curvatusSC076 was significantly more effective againstL. monocytogenesthan other LAB from the same environment, reinforcing that these highly specific, potent interactions are a key area for discovery in probiotic research.

This study demonstrates that polysaccharide-rich extracts fromA. bisporusandP. ostreatusare multi-functional bioactive ingredients with significant potential for the functional food industry. These extracts possess potent intrinsic antioxidant properties and, more importantly, act as advanced prebiotics. The primary finding of this work is the clear prebiotic capacity of these extracts, which selectively stimulated the growth of beneficial lactobacilli. The present study goes a crucial step further by revealing the functional consequence of this prebiotic action. This study demonstrated a powerful, indirect antipathogenic effect, where cell-free supernatants fromLactobacilluscultures enriched with these polysaccharides were highly effective at inhibiting pathogens, most notablyL. monocytogenes. This illustrates a sophisticated synbiotic mechanism where the polysaccharides do not simply act as “food” for probiotics, but actively enhance their ability to produce protective metabolites, thereby creating a more defensive gut environment. TheA. bisporusextract, when combined withL. acidophilus, emerged as a particularly superior combination, highlighting the specificity of these probiotic-prebiotic interactions. However, this study has several limitations that open avenues for future research. The experiments were conducted entirelyin- vitro, which does not fully replicate the complex, anaerobic ecosystem of the human gut. Furthermore, the number of probiotic strains tested was limited, and the antipathogenic assay was qualitative. Future work should therefore focus onin- vivomodels to assess the impact of these synbiotics on complex gut microbiota. Additionally, quantitative measures, such as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), are needed to determine the precise potency of the antimicrobial effect, and a broader range of probiotic strains should be screened to optimize these interactions for gastrointestinal health. Ultimately, positive outcomes from these preclinical studies would be essential to justify and guide the design of future human clinical trials to validate these findings in a practical, therapeutic context.
