Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia that is observed to increase in frequency with advancing age. In addition to the natural process of aging, a number of chronic health conditions have been associated with the occurrence and increased risk of developing AF. Such conditions include hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease, among others.

AF is an important cause in patients presenting with an embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Especially with advanced age, left atrium enlargement and frequent supraventricular extrasystoles.[7,8]Despite limited evidence supporting AF screening for primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in the general population, ECG screening is crucial, and while smartphones and smartwatches offer potential for AF screening and monitoring, further research is needed to establish their appropriate use and target populations.[9]Figure 1illustrates the potential mechanisms linking atrial fibrillation to stroke.

Key pathways and mechanisms in atrial fbrillation and stroke.

In conclusion, AF is the most common tachyarrhythmia and a major cause of silent and clinical stroke. The relationship between AF and cerebral ischemia is bidirectional and we now have a better understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis and other mechanisms associated with AF. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is important because of the early prevention of stroke. Individualized treatment for AF patients with/without stroke is necessary.
