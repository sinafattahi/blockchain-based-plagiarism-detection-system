The aim of this study is to determine the possible role of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysregulation in the ischemic electrical remodeling observed in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Human heart tissue was obtained from the border of the infarct and remote zones of patients with ischemic heart disease, and mouse heart tissue was obtained from the peri‐infarct zone. NMDAR expression was detected using immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blotting (WB). Spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) in mice were detected using electrocardiogram backpacks. Electrical remodeling post‐MI was detected using patch clamp recordings, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reactions, IF, and WB. Mechanistic studies were performed using bioinformatic analysis, plasmid and small interfering RNA transfection, lentiviral packaging, and site‐directed mutagenesis.

NMDAR is highly expressed in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI. NMDAR inhibition reduces the occurrence of VAs. Mechanistically, NMDAR activation promotes electrophysiological remodeling, as characterized by decreased Nav1.5, Kv11.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, Kir2.1, and Cav1.2 expression in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI and rescues these ion channels dysregulation in mice with MI to varying degrees by NMDAR inhibition. Decreased Nav1.5 expression and inward sodium current density were attenuated by NMDAR inhibition in primary rat cardiomyocytes. Moreover, NMDAR activation upregulates T‐Box Transcription Factor 3 (TBX3) post‐translationally, further downregulating Nav1.5 transcriptionally. Furthermore, AKT1 is the predominant isoform in the ventricular myocardium upstream of TBX3 and mediates NMDAR‐induced TBX3 upregulation in cardiomyocytes.

NMDAR activation contributes to MI‐induced VAs by regulating the AKT1–TBX3–Nav1.5 axis, providing novel therapeutic strategies for treating ischemic arrhythmias.

Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are common complications of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and a major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) [1]. Early evidence suggests that patients with a severely low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are at high risk of malignant VAs and SCD [2]. Fatal VAs in patients with ischemic heart disease have been shown to be independent of the degree of LVEF reduction [3]. Additionally, patients with an LVEF of 50% experience fatal arrhythmias, mainly due to ion channel remodeling and cardiac electrical abnormalities [3,4].

Cardiac electrical remodeling in response to structural damage after MI involves changes in the inward sodium (Na+), outward potassium (K+), and inward calcium (Ca) currents [5]. These changes contribute to myocardial conduction disturbances and increase ventricular repolarization abnormalities, resulting in arrhythmias [6]. The alpha subunit of the cardiac voltage‐gated sodium channel, Nav1.5, is encoded by the sodium voltage‐gated channel alpha subunit 5 (SCN5A) and is crucial in cardiac conduction velocity [7] and arrhythmic risk [8]. Previous studies have shown that SCN5A expression is significantly reduced in ischemic hearts [9], and loss of function in Nav1.5 may be associated with arrhythmic storm development in patients with acute MI [10]. Therefore, reversing downregulation of Nav1.5 may reduce the risk of ischemic arrhythmias [11]. In addition, SCN5A mutations are associated with various arrhythmogenic diseases such as Brugada and long QT syndromes [12].

Of course, cardiac electrical disorders also include potassium channel abnormalities. Among them, there are two components of delayed rectifier currents: the rapid (IKr) and the slow (IKs) components. IKrmoves through the α subunit pore Kv11.1, and IKsflows through the α subunit Kv7.1. Studies show that both IKrand IKscurrent densities were reduced in canine ventricular myocytes from infarcted hearts [13]. The downregulation of Kv4.3/Kv4.2 leads to a decrease in the density of the transient outward potassium current (Ito) in MI models [14]. Improving ischemia‐induced Kv4.3/Kv4.2 dysfunction can reduce the incidence of post‐MI VAs in mice [15]. The inward‐rectifier K current (IK1) contributes to the resting membrane potential, controls cardiac excitability, and modulates late‐phase repolarization and action potential duration in cardiac cells. Decreased IK1and decreased expression of the principle underlying subunit potassium inwardly‐rectifying channel subfamily J member 2 (KCNJ2) messenger RNA (mRNA) and its encoded Kir2.1 protein are prominent features of ventricular electrical remodeling after MI [16]. Additionally, Cav1.2, a classical L‐type Ca2+channel activated in the sarcolemma, forms excitation‐contraction couplings that affect the duration of action potential [17]. Downregulation of Cav1.2 in mice with MI results in early repolarization and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias [18,19].

The N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ligand‐gated voltage‐dependent ionotropic glutamate receptors at the cell–cell contact site. NMDARs are assembled as heteromers that differ in subunit composition. To date, seven different subunits have been identified, namely the GluN1 subunit (also known as NR1), four distinct GluN2 subunits (GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C, and GluN2D) and a pair of GluN3 (GluN3A and GluN3B) [20,21]. Functional NMDARs require the assembly of two NR1 subunits together with two GluN2 subunits or a combination of GluN2 and GluN3 subunits. Activation of most NMDAR configurations requires binding of glutamate to GluN2 and co‐agonist, glycine, or D‐serine, to NR1 [20], leading to calcium ion overload and neuronal apoptosis [22]. Studies have demonstrated that NMDAR is associated with various neurological and psychiatric diseases. NMDAR antagonists are neuroprotective when administered before or shortly after traumatic brain injury or an ischemic insult in animal models [23,24]. Inhibiting the GluN2B subunit‐containing NMDAR can reduce the gradual loss of synaptic function [25] and eventually lead to neuronal cell death [26], which is considered one of the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration in patients with AD. Furthermore, by interfering with the GluN2A subunit, synaptic localization reduces the percentage of rats with Parkinson's disease that develop dyskinetic movements [27]. In addition, altered glutamate signaling and abnormal NMDAR function may provide a pathological basis for the occurrence of schizophrenia [28], depression [29], autism [30], and other mental disorders [31,32].

Recent studies have shown that NMDAR also exists in the cardiovascular system, mainly in atrial myocytes, ventricular myocytes, heart conduction systems, and vascular endothelium [33]. In a rat model of ischemia–reperfusion injury, NMDAR‐driven calcium influx potentiated adverse effects [34]. Furthermore, pharmacological NMDAR blockade in a monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension had beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, decreasing endothelial dysfunction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis resistance while disrupting the NMDAR pathway in the pulmonary arteries [35]. Moreover, NMDAR inhibition attenuates cardiac remodeling, lipid peroxidation, and neutrophil recruitment in rats with heart failure [36]. Furthermore, accumulating evidence shows that it is closely associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias. In the atria of healthy rats, NMDAR activation reduces heart rate variability and increases susceptibility to atrial fibrillation [37]. Long‐term chronic activation of NMDAR downregulated the K+channel protein of ventricular myocytes, accompanied by mild myocardial interstitial fibrosis, and promoted the occurrence of VAs [38]. In rat models of MI and ischemia–reperfusion, NMDAR activation induces ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation [39], which are effectively attenuated by the NMDAR‐specific inhibitor Dizocilpine (MK801, a non‐competitive NMDAR inhibitor) after ischemia–reperfusion [40]. NMDAR inhibition also reduces the Ca2+load in the mitochondria [41] and induces antioxidant effects [39]. However, the mechanism underlying the role of NMDAR in post‐MI VAs remains unclear.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the possible role of NMDAR dysregulation in the ischemic electrical remodeling observed in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that NMDAR activation promotes ischemic arrhythmia by targeting the AKT1–T‐Box Transcription Factor 3 (TBX3)–Nav1.5 axis, highlighting NMDAR inhibition as a potential anti‐arrhythmic therapy for ischemic heart disease.

First, we investigated NMDAR expression and activation in the cardiomyocytes of patients with ischemic heart disease. The results showed that the NR1 and Ser‐896‐phosphorylated NR1 (p‐NR1) levels were higher at the border of the infarct zone than in the remote zone in patients with ischemic heart disease (Figure1a,b,e). One week after left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation in mice with MI, NR1 and p‐NR1 levels increased in the peri‐infarct zone compared with those in the corresponding region of the sham‐operated hearts. NR1 remained highly expressed and activated 2 weeks after MI (Figure1c,d,f).

Data from three independent repetitions of experiments are expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Two‐tailed Student'sttest was performed for comparison between two groups, and one‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. A value ofp< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

To determine whether NMDAR activation is involved in MI‐induced VAs, we conducted another in vivo study, as shown in Figure2a, in which MK801 was administered to mice with MI. First, the results verified that increased NR1 expression and activation levels in mice with MI were attenuated by MK801 (FigureS1a,b), indicating the potential role of NMDAR in MI cases. Furthermore, five of eight mice in the MI group and three of eight mice in the MI‐MK801 group showed spontaneous VAs (Figure2b,c). No arrhythmias were observed in the sham group. Notably, one mouse in the MI group died during the electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing. ECG showed that the mouse first developed frequent ventricular fibrillation, with occasional effective ventricular contractions, followed by ventricular tachycardia, which lasted for approximately 13 s, after which the ventricle developed a spontaneous ventricular rhythm (Figure2d). However, mice in the sham and MI‐MK801 groups did not die when the ECG was traced.

One‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. (*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001).

In addition, echocardiography showed that LVEF and fractional shortening (LVFS) decreased in the MI group, which was attenuated by MK801 administration (Figure2e–g). Furthermore, MK801 attenuated the MI‐induced increase in the LV mass (Figure2h), and the collagen size of MK801‐treated mouse hearts reduced 2 weeks after MI compared with that of the MI group (Figure2i,j).

To further study the mechanisms underlying NMDAR regulation of MI‐induced VAs, we examined several major ion channels, Nav1.5, Kv11.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, Kir2.1, and Cav1.2 in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI. The results showed that Nav1.5 expression decreased at the border of the infarct zone compared with that at the border of the remote zone in patients with ischemic heart disease (Figure3a–c). In mice with MI, Nav1.5 decreased and was intensively attenuated by MK801 (Figure3d–f). The results also showed that Kv11.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, Kir2.1, and Cav1.2 decreased in the hearts of patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI; however, the decrease in mice with MI was attenuated to varying degrees by MK801 (FiguresS2andS3).

(*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001).

To investigate the specific mechanism of NMDAR regulating VAs after MI through the Nav1.5 expression, cellular models of NMDAR activation in vitro have been studied. According to the results in FigureS4, H9C2 cells were treated with NMDA for 36 h (the optimum NMDA treatment time) to effectively activate NMDAR. This activation reduced Nav1.5, which was attenuated by MK801 or the removal of Ca2+from the medium (Figure3g,h).

Furthermore, we recorded the INadensity in primary rat cardiomyocytes using whole‐cell patch‐clamp techniques. Figure3i–kshows that Nav1.5 expression and the current densities of INawere reduced during NMDAR activation, in contrast to the control, MK801 administration, or removal of Ca2+from the medium groups.

Mechanistically, we screened for potential binding sites and confirmed the enrichment of TBX3 in the promoter regions of mouse and human SCN5A using the Cistrome Data and UCSC database (Figure4a,b) [42,43]. Furthermore, different amounts of porcine cytomegalovirus (pCMV)‐flag‐TBX3 were transfected, and the results showed that TBX3 overexpression inhibited the expression of Nav1.5 in H9C2 cells (Figure4c,d). Conversely, TBX3 knockdown using the screened small interfering RNA with the best interference effect (Figure4e,f) caused an increase in Nav1.5 (Figure4g–i). We simultaneously validated the in vivo expression of TBX3. We found increased TBX3 protein levels in the peri‐infarct zone of patients with ischemic heart disease (FigureS5a) and mice with MI (FigureS5c), which MK801 attenuated. However, there was no difference in TBX3 mRNA levels in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI (FigureS5b,d). Additionally, in H9C2 cells, NMDAR activation upregulated the protein level rather than the mRNA level of TBX3, which was attenuated by MK801 or Ca2+removal (FigureS5e–g).

TBX3 was a negative controller of Scn5a transcription. (a, b) The enrichment of TBX3 in the mouse and human cardiac SCN5A promoter region was obtained by data mining using the Cistrome and UCSC databases. The original dataset isGSM862695andGSM2825557. (c, d) Nav1.5 protein and mRNA levels overexpressed with different amounts of pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3 in H9C2 cells. (e, f) Screening of the best small interfering RNAs for TBX3 (si‐TBX3) using Western blot and RT‐PCR. (g–i) TBX3 knockdown caused an increase in both the mRNA and protein levels of Nav1.5. Data from three independent repetitions of experiments are expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Two‐tailed Student'sttest was performed for comparison between two groups, and one‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. (*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001).

Firstly, H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with MK2206 at various time points. A significant decrease in p‐AKT and endogenous TBX3 protein levels compared with mRNA levels was observed at all tested time points, corresponding with increased endogenous Nav1.5 expression (Figure5a–c). Furthermore, considering that there are three AKT isoforms (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3), based on reported single‐cell transcriptome data [44,45], AKT1 is the dominant isoform in the myocardium and ventricle subclusters during the development of mice (Figure5d). Moreover, real‐time polymerase chain reaction was performed to verify that AKT3 was barely expressed and that AKT1 was the predominant isoform in human, mouse, and rat ventricular myocardia (Figure5e). Finally, we depleted AKT1 with short hairpin RNAs that target the three prime untranslated region of AKT1 (Figure5f). A decrease in TBX3 protein levels and an increase in Nav1.5 were observed in AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells (Figure5g).

AKT1 is the predominant AKT isoform in myocardium and post‐translationally upregulates TBX3. (a) Protein levels of TBX3 and Nav1.5 in H9C2 cells treated with MK2206 at different time points. (b, c) mRNA levels of Nav1.5 and TBX3 in H9C2 cells treated with MK2206 at different time points. (d) Bioinformatics analysis based on the reported single‐cell transcriptome data. The original dataset isGSE126128. (e) qRT‐PCR analyses using primers specific to AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 of human, mice, and H9C2 cells. (f) Screening of the best small hairpin RNAs for AKT1 (sh‐AKT1) using Western blot. (g) AKT1 knockdown caused a decrease in TBX3 protein level and an increase in Nav1.5 protein level. Data from three independent repetitions of experiments are expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Two‐tailed Student'sttest was performed for comparison between two groups, and one‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. (*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001).

To further determine how AKT1 modulates TBX3, we observed that MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, improved TBX3 protein levels in AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells (Figure6a). Furthermore, H9C2 and AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with cycloheximide (CHX, a protein translation inhibitor) at different time points (0, 2, 4, and 6 h), and endogenous TBX3 was evaluated using Western blotting. The results showed that the stability of TBX3 decreased in AKT1‐silenced cells (Figure6b,c).

AKT1 promotes TBX3 protein stability and enhances its ability to repress Nav1.5 by pseudo‐phosphorylation of TBX3 at serine 720. (a) MG132, an inhibitor of the proteasome, rescued TBX3 protein levels in AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells. (b, c) The decay rates of TBX3 protein level in both H9C2 cells and AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells were evaluated using Western blot. (d, e) AKT1 phosphorylation of TBX3 at serine 720 enhanced the ability to inhibit Nav1.5 in H9C2 cells, identified using Western blot and RT‐PCR. Data from three independent repetitions of experiments are expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs). One‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. (**p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001).

Furthermore, H9C2 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3, pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3‐S720A, and pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3‐S720E plasmids to test whether pseudo‐phosphorylation of TBX3 at serine 720 could affect its ability to repress Nav1.5. Compared with the control group, Nav1.5 expression decreased after pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3 and pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3‐S720E were overexpressed. Compared with the overexpression of pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3, Nav1.5 expression was reduced after the overexpression of pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3‐S720E and increased after the overexpression of pCMV‐Flag‐TBX3‐S720A (Figure6d,e).

Based on these results, we hypothesized that NMDAR activation promotes post‐MI arrhythmia through the AKT1–TBX3–Nav1.5 axis. Primarily, our results showed that p‐AKT1 was increased at the border of the infarct zone compared with that at the remote zone in patients with ischemic heart disease (Figure7a). The level of p‐AKT1 was elevated in mice with MI, which was attenuated by MK801 (Figure7b). NMDAR activation consistently increased the expression of p‐AKT1 in H9C2 cells, which was attenuated by MK801 or Ca2+removal (Figure7c). Furthermore, p‐AKT1 was decreased following the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by MK2206, and NMDAR activation failed to increase TBX3 or decrease Nav1.5 levels (Figure7d). Moreover, NMDAR activation failed to promote TBX3 and decrease Nav1.5 in AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells coherently (Figure7e).

(b) Protein levels of p‐AKT1 and quantitative analysis in MI mice evaluated using Western blot. (c) Protein levels of p‐AKT1 and quantitative analysis in H9C2 cells evaluated using Western blot. (d) NMDAR activation failed to increase TBX3 expression and decrease Nav1.5 levels when inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation. (e) NMDAR activation failed to promote the expression of TBX3 and decrease Nav1.5 levels in AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells.

Two‐tailed Student'sttest was performed for comparison between two groups, and one‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01.

This is the first study to demonstrate that NMDAR inhibition attenuates MI‐induced Nav1.5 reduction, preventing the incidence of VAs in post‐MI hearts by targeting the AKT1–TBX3–Nav1.5 axis. Therefore, our findings provide a new treatment strategy for ischemic VAs and suggest that NMDAR is a promising target for preventing VAs and SCD in patients with MI.

NMDARs are ion channels gated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and are widespread in the CNS as essential mediators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Accumulating evidence shows the role of NMDAR in ischemic stroke [24], and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [46], Parkinson's disease [27], and Huntington's disease [47]. Besides, NMDAR is vital in schizophrenia [28], depression [29], epilepsy [48], and other mental disorders [31]. Studies have shown that NMDAR is also present in the cardiovascular system. Glutamate accumulation and NMDAR upregulation have been demonstrated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [35]. The functional subunit NR1 is found in all NMDAR subtypes, and the p‐NR1 regulates NMDAR activation [49]. In the present study, we demonstrated that the ischemic myocardium displayed high NR1‐subunit expression and activation in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI. NMDAR activation reduces heart rate variability and increases the susceptibility of the atria of healthy rats to atrial fibrillation [37]. In rat models of MI and ischemia–reperfusion, NMDAR activation induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation [39]. NMDAR inhibition consistently exerted anti‐arrhythmic effects on the post‐infarct ventricular myocardium, as shown by the spontaneous decrease in the incidence of VAs 2 weeks after MI. Our results indicate that NMDAR inhibition could protect cardiac function and myocardial fibrosis after MI.

Electrical remodeling of cardiac ion channels after MI contributes to myocardial conduction disturbances and increases ventricular repolarization dispersion, resulting in the development of arrhythmias [50]. Notably, several cardiac ion channels, such as Na, K, and Ca channels, participate in susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after MI [17,51,52]. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that Nav1.5, Kv11.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, Kir2.1, and Cav1.2 decreased in MI hearts [17,53]. Dysfunction of intracellular Na channels is a critical predisposing factor for life‐threatening VAs [54]. Ikrinhibition leads to delayed ventricular repolarization and prolonged QT intervals, thus triggering fatal VA [55]. The functional expression of IKschannels decreases, leading to an increase in the duration of action potentials [56]. Improving the decreased expression of Ito, Iks, and Ikrcan reduce the occurrence of VAs [17]. Decreased IK1expression after MI leads to an increased action potential duration [19]. Cav1.2 participates in excitation‐contraction coupling and affects action potential duration [17,18]. Our results also showed that the expression of Nav1.5 was significantly decreased in the hearts of patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI, which MK801 attenuated. In addition, we demonstrated that Kv11.1, Kv4.2, Kv7.1, Kir2.1, and Cav1.2 decreased in the hearts of human patients with ischemic heart disease and MI mice, and they were attenuated by MK801 in MI mice to relatively moderate degrees, although the detailed mechanism remained unclear in this study.

Next, we investigated the mechanism of NMDAR regulating VAs after MI through the Nav1.5 expression. Therefore, it was activated or inhibited at the cellular level to study this potential mechanism. Notably, NMDAR is the main pathway of neuronal Ca2+entry under the action of glutamate [57], which is temporarily compensated by Na/Ca2+exchanger (NCX)‐mediated Ca2+extrusion [58]. In neurons, NCX exhibits the highest transport capacity for Ca2+[58]. In the forward mode, NCX catalyzes the extrusion of 1 Ca2+to exchange 3 Na+, thus maintaining a low intracellular Ca2+concentration [59]. However, NCX was reversed when the intracellular Na+concentration increased [60]. In this case, the reverse operation of NCX (NCXrev) may continuously increase Ca2+, leading to delayed calcium dysregulation [61]. Therefore, we speculated that the effect of Ca2+on NMDAR‐dependent arrhythmogenesis may also be crucial. In another subgroup, we removed Ca2+from the external environment of the cells using a calcium‐free minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and then treated them with NMDA. Similarly, p‐NR1 and NR1 expression increased, whereas Nav1.5 and INacurrent density decreased after NMDA treatment, which was attenuated by MK801 or by removing Ca2+from the medium. These results suggest that NMDAR regulates Nav1.5 expression and INacurrent density in ischemic cardiomyocytes, which may be a potential mechanism by which NMDAR regulates VAs after MI; however, the effect of Ca2+on NMDAR‐dependent arrhythmogenesis should be considered.

Previous studies have demonstrated that T‐box factors belong to an ancient protein family and consist of a series of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors. They share a common DNA‐binding motif called the T‐box domain, which is critical in developing organs such as the heart and kidneys [62]. In the normal adult heart, TBX3 overexpression inhibits the expression of Gap junction protein alpha‐1, Gap junction protein alpha‐5, SCN5A, and natriuretic peptide precursor A, significantly reducing conduction velocity [63]. We screened for potential binding sites and confirmed the enrichment of TBX3 in the promoter regions of human [42] and mouse [43] SCN5A using the Cistrome and UCSC databases. Further results demonstrated that TBX3 negatively correlated with Nav1.5 expression in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Notably, the protein level of TBX3 increased significantly in the peri‐infarct area of patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI and was attenuated by MK801 in mice with MI. However, there was no significant difference in the mRNA level of TBX3 in patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI. In H9C2 cardiomyocytes, NMDAR activation upregulated TBX3 protein levels rather than mRNA levels, which were attenuated by MK801 treatment or Ca2+removal. Therefore, NMDAR activation inhibits Nav1.5 transcriptionally by regulating TBX3 post‐translationally.

Post‐translational modifications, including phosphorylation of transcription factors, are crucial in regulating gene expression because they can affect transcription factor target gene binding and regulation [64]. Previous studies have shown that TBX3 is a key substrate of AKT3 in the occurrence of melanoma, and pseudo‐phosphorylation at serine 720 promotes protein stability and enhances its ability to repress E‐cadherin in melanoma cells [65]. Pseudo‐phosphorylation of TBX3 at serine 720 enhances the activation of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain in fibrosarcoma and chondrosarcoma cells [66]. Therefore, although previous studies report that NMDAR activation mainly exerts downstream biological effects through the Ca2+/CAM/CaMKII/Ras and PI3K/AKT pathways [67,68], we investigated whether NMDAR might regulate VAs after MI through the AKT‐TBX3 pathway. MK2206 was used to inhibit AKT phosphorylation at various time points. The results showed a sharp decrease in p‐AKT and endogenous TBX3 protein levels instead of mRNA levels at all tested time points, corresponding to an increase in endogenous Nav1.5 expression levels. Furthermore, considering that there are three AKT isoforms (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3), we reanalyzed based on the reported single‐cell transcriptome data [44,45]. The results illustrated that AKT1 is the dominant isoform in the myocardium and ventricle subclusters. We then verified that AKT1 is the dominant isoform in human, rat, and mouse ventricular myocardium and is a critical upstream regulator of TBX3. Similar to previous studies, we showed that TBX3 is post‐translationally modified by AKT1, likely through phosphorylation, increasing TBX3 protein stability. Furthermore, results showed that AKT1 regulates TBX3 through phosphorylation at serine 720, which enhances its ability to inhibit Nav1.5 in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.

These results were then validated in vivo. In patients with ischemic heart disease and mice with MI, p‐AKT1 was increased, which was attenuated by MK801 in mice with MI and H9C2 cells. Finally, MK2206 inhibition of AKT phosphorylation decreased p‐AKT1, and NMDAR activation failed to increase TBX3 expression and decrease Nav1.5 expression. Moreover, NMDAR activation failed to promote TBX3 expression and inhibit Nav1.5 expression in AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells, demonstrating that AKT1 mediated NMDAR‐induced TBX3 upregulation in ventricular cardiomyocytes.

Our study has some limitations. First, our early results showed that NMDAR also regulates K and Ca current in ischemic cardiomyocytes, which may be another potential mechanism through which NMDAR regulates VAs after MI. The specific mechanisms and ion channels that are mainly involved will be the focus of our follow‐up studies. Second, studies have proven that both NMDAR and NCXrevare critical contributors to delayed calcium dysregulation in neurons exposed to glutamate, and inhibiting both Ca2+entry mechanisms is necessary [69]. However, the role of NCXrevin NMDA‐induced changes in intracellular Ca2+concentration remains unclear, and this is a vital research area for follow‐up studies. Third, we observed that AKT1 is the predominant form in ventricular myocytes. However, further investigation is required to determine whether AKT2 is involved in NMDAR‐induced TBX3 upregulation. Finally, we investigated NMDAR‐promoted electrical remodeling after MI. However, the role of NMDAR in structural remodeling and myocardial fibrosis after MI remains unclear.

In conclusion, our data revealed a novel AKT1–TBX3–Nav1.5 axis that may promote electrical remodeling after MI. These findings have critical implications for developing new therapeutic strategies for ischemic VAs.

Human heart tissues were obtained from the failing hearts of patients with end‐stage ischemic heart disease (n= 7). Details of coronary angiography of patients were shown in TableS5. These samples were obtained from patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (reference number: 2021‐763). According to the coronary angiography results, tissues from the border of the infarct zone and the remote zone (the posterior wall of the left ventricle—close to the coronary sulcus) were selected.

Male C57BL/6 mice (20–25 g) were housed under standard animal room conditions (temperature of 22°C ± 1°C, humidity of 55%–60%). First, we constructed a mouse model of MI at different time points. The animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham (n= 6), MI (1 week,n= 6), and MI (2 weeks,n= 6). The mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium. LAD ligation was performed as previously described. Sham group animals were subjected to the same procedures as the MI group, except for LAD ligation. ECGs were used to detect the presence of MI after 24 h of LAD ligation. MI was confirmed on the basis of ST‐segment elevation and T‐wave inversion on ECG lead II. Second, the animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham (n= 7), MI (2 weeks,n= 8), and MI‐MK801 (2 weeks,n= 8). The MI mice were randomized to receive MK801 (0.5 mg/kg) or DMSO by intraperitoneal injection once every day for 2 weeks 24 h after MI surgery. The investigation conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85–23, revised 1996) and was approved by the Institution Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (reference number: 2021‐1405).

Echocardiography was performed by an investigator blinded to the study design using a Vevo 2100 system (VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2%–4% isoflurane (MIDMARK, USA) using a gas chamber. Anesthesia was monitored by ensuring that the pedal withdrawal reflex was absent. Measurements were performed by an independent investigator.

Two weeks later, the mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium. ECG backpacks were used to record the ECG of mice for 24 h in an awakened state. All ECG data were acquired using a multichannel electrophysiological recording system (Transonic Scisense Inc., London, ON, Canada). The definition of VAs is based on the Lambeth Convention II [70].

TBX3 was amplified and cloned into the pCMV‐Flag‐N vector (635 688; Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). All mutants of Flag‐TBX3 (Flag‐TBX3‐S720A, Flag‐TBX3‐S720E) were created by site‐specific mutation experiments.

H9C2 and 293T cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (5.5 mM; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2and 95% air).

Transient knockdown of TBX3 expression was achieved by transfecting the cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that specifically targeted mRNA expression of TBX3. Briefly, H9C2 cells were plated at 7 × 104/well of a 12‐well plate and transfected with 50 nM siTBX3‐1 (Forward 5‐CAGAGAUGGUCAUUACGAATT‐3; Reverse 5‐UUCGUAAUGACCAUCUCUGTT‐3), 50 nM siTBX3‐2 (Forward 5‐GCUGAUGACUGUCGAUAUATT‐3; Reverse 5‐UAUAUCGACAGUCAUCAGCTT‐3), 50 nM siTBX3‐3 (Forward 5‐CUAUCAGAAUGACAAGAUATT‐3; Reverse 5‐UAUCUUGUCAUUCUGAUAGTT‐3), or a control siRNA (non‐silencing, si‐CON), using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen Life Technology,San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Overexpression of Flag‐TBX3 and the mutant forms (pCMV‐TBX3‐S720A, pCMV‐TBX3‐S720E) was achieved as follows: H9C2 cells were plated at 7 × 104/well of a 12‐well plate, and the next day transiently transfected with the above vectors or the pCMV‐Flag‐N vector using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen Life Technology, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

AKT1 knockdown was achieved by lentivirus‐mediated RNA interference.

Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting AKT1 (sh1‐AKT1: Forward 5′‐GATCC GCACCTTTATTGGCTACAAGGCAAGAGCCTTGTAGCCAATAAAGGTGC TTTTTG‐3′, Reverse 5′‐AATTCAAAAAGCACCTTTATTGGCTACAAGGCTCTTGCCTTGTAGCCAATAAAGGTGC G‐3′; sh2‐AKT1: Forward 5′‐GATCCGCACATCAAGATAACGGACTTCAAGAG AAGTCCGTTATCTTGATGTGCTTTTTG‐3′, Reverse 5′‐AATTCAAAAA GCACATCAAGATAACGGACTTCTCTTGAAGTCCGTTATCTTGATGTGCG‐3′; sh3‐AKT1: Forward 5′‐GATCCGCTGTTCGAGCTCATCCTAATCAAGAGATTAGGATGAGCTCGAACAGC TTTTTG‐3′, Reverse 5′‐AATTCAAAAAGCTGTTCGAGCTCATCCTAATCTCTTG ATTAGGATGAGCTCGAACAGCG‐3′), and negative‐control shRNA (sh‐CON) were designed and cloned into the lentivector pGreenPuro shRNA vector (SI505A‐1; System Biosciences, Pale Alto, CA, USA), and were then cotransfected with ViraPower lentiviral packaging mix (Thermo) into 293T cells to produce the lentivirus‐containing shAKT1 or sh‐CON. The H9C2 cells were then infected with the resultant lentiviruses and screened using puromycin (5 g/mL) (A1113803; Invitrogen) to obtain AKT1‐silenced cells. AKT1 knockdown was assessed using Western blot.

The H9C2 cells were maintained as described previously [71]. NMDA (0.1 mM, Sigma, USA) and MK801 (30 μM, Sigma, USA) were used to activate and inhibit NMDAR, respectively. MK2206 (2.5 μM, GLPBIO, USA) was used to inhibit AKT kinase activity in the H9C2 cells. The H9C2 cells in the NMDA‐Ca2+‐free group were treated with the calcium‐free MEM medium containing 2% FBS. To inhibit ubiquitin‐mediated protein degradation, AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells were treated with MG132 (20 μM, Selleckchem, USA) for 16 h. The AKT1‐silenced H9C2 cells and H9C2 cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 20 μg/mL, GLPBIO, USA) to block de novo protein synthesis. The control cells were treated with DMSO.

Primary rat cardiomyocytes were dissociated from 0‐ to 1‐day‐old SPF‐grade rat hearts. In brief, cardiomyocytes were isolated using a selective adherent technique after digestion with 0.25% trypsin solution. Cardiomyocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air at 37°C for 48 h.

Patch‐clamp recordings were obtained at room temperature (23°C–25°C). The EPC‐10 USB amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Germany) was connected to a computer running Patchmaster software (Heka, Germany). Offset potentials were nulled directly before the formation of a seal. No leak subtraction was made. Fast capacitance compensation was made after a high seal was achieved; membrane capacitance (in pF) compensation was made from whole‐cell capacitance compensation after the whole‐cell mode was achieved. Data were sampled at 20 kHz in voltage‐clamp mode. The tip resistance was in the range of 3–5 MΩ when the electrode was backfilled with internal solution. All data were analyzed offline using PatchMaster (Axon Instruments, USA), and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad, USA). Values are represented as either raw or normalized means±SEM, with a significance threshold set atp< 0.05. Two‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison was used to analyze significance between independent samples under multiple conditions. One‐way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to compare multiple independent groups.

Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described [71]. The primary antibodies used were NR1 (1:100, Abcam), p‐NR1 (1:50, Abcam), cTnT (1:100, Proteintech), Nav1.5 (1:200, Proteintech), Kv11.1 (1:200, Abcam), Kv4.2 (1:200, Proteintech), Kv7.1 (1:200, Abcam), Kir2.1 (1:200, Proteintech), Cav1.2 (1:200, Proteintech), and TBX3 (1:200, Abcam).

Total RNA was extracted from the myocardial samples and cells using TRIzol reagent and an RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and was reverse transcribed using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology [Dalian] Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). qRT–PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Biotechnology [Dalian] Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) and a Mastercycler EP realplex detection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). TablesS2–S4summarizes the primer sequences used in this study.

The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti‐NR1 (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti‐p‐NR1 (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti‐Nav1.5 (1:1000, Proteintech), rabbit monoclonal anti‐Kv11.1 (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti‐Kv4.2 (1:1000, Proteintech), mouse monoclonal anti‐Kv7.1 (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti‐Kir2.1 (1:1000, Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal anti‐Cav1.2 (1:1000, Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal anti‐TBX3 (1:1000, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti‐Flag M2 (1:1000, Sigma‐Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal AKT (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal p‐AKT (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal AKT1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal p‐AKT1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), mouse polyclonal anti‐tubulin (1:1000, Proteintech), and mouse polyclonal anti‐actin (1:1000, Proteintech). The secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated goat anti‐mouse (1:5000, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and goat anti‐rabbit (1:5000, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology), were used.

Data from three independent experiments are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Two‐tailed Student'st‐test was performed for comparison between two groups; one‐way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey's test was used to compare the data from multiple groups. Small sample size categorical data were expressed as percentages and analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
