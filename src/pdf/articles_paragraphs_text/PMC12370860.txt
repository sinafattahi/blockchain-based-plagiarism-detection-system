This paper explores the ethical implications of long-term, transgenerational projects through the lens of neo-republican theory, focusing on the issue of intergenerational domination. Traditional accounts of intergenerational justice often emphasize one-directional influence from present to future generations. This study proposes a threefold generational framework—the current generation (CG), subsequent generations (SGs), and remote generations (RGs)—to better capture the temporal complexity and multi-layered dependencies that define transgenerational projects such as radioactive waste management. Building on the concept ofprojectual reciprocity, the paper argues that SGs do not merely receive pre-commitments from the CG but play a crucial role in the continuation or discontinuation of long-term projects, thereby holding a latent power over both the CG and RGs. This relational structure reveals a complex web of entangled dominations, where minimizing domination for one generational group may inadvertently increase it for another. Through comparative analysis of geological disposal and interim storage, the study critically reassesses the autonomy-related claims associated with each option and highlights the normative significance of reversibility and retrievability as mechanisms of intergenerational contestability. In this context, autonomy is redefined not as mere access to options, but as non-domination, following the neo-republican conception. The ethical concern lies not in the presence or absence of material harm per se, but in the extent to which RGs are structurally subordinated to the discretionary actions of their predecessors. By challenging conventional accounts of autonomy, the paper offers a revised framework for evaluating the legitimacy of transgenerational projects.

How should we ethically govern projects that span multiple generations? This question arises with increasing urgency in areas such as nuclear waste management, climate policy, and infrastructure planning—domains in which not only the consequences but also the implementation itself unfolds across decades or even centuries, requiring ongoing engagement from successive generations. Traditional models of intergenerational ethics are ill-equipped to address the complexity of these long-term endeavors. This paper proposes an expanded framework of intergenerational domination to analyze such transgenerational projects, using radioactive waste management as its primary case study.

In recent years, discussions on intergenerational ethics and justice have increasingly engaged with the concept of domination. Rooted in the neo-republican tradition developed by thinkers such as Philip Pettit and Frank Lovett, domination is understood not in terms of actual harm, but rather in terms of capacity—specifically, the capacity to interfere arbitrarily (Pettit,1997; Lovett,2010). Although the original concept of domination was formulated with contemporaneous and directly interacting pairs—such as slave and master—in mind, scholars have increasingly examined whether it can also be applied across spatial or temporal distances. Recent debates on intergenerational domination suggest that the original concept can be adapted—albeit with modifications—to fit the context of intergenerational relationships. As Smith notes, “focusing on domination properly orients our concern towards the power dynamics between generations that allow for the possibility of abuse and exploitation” (Smith,2013).

The primary aim of this paper is to further expand the concept of intergenerational domination by examining the intergenerational dynamics involved in what I calltransgenerational projects. These are long-term endeavors—such as the construction of the Sagrada Família—that span roughly 100 years or more and require the active involvement of multiple successive generations from initiation to completion.

The focus lies on a dyadic relationship between the current generation (CG) and future generations.

The analysis centers on domination by the CG over future generations.

Subsequent generations (SGs), who actively participate in the continuation of the transgenerational project.

Remote generations (RGs), who are more passively affected by the project’s eventual success or failure.

Among the many domains where transgenerational dynamics play a decisive role, high-level radioactive waste (HLW) management presents a particularly vivid and policy-relevant case. It epitomizes the challenges of designing institutions and technologies today that will be governed, maintained, or revised by people many generations from now. Building on the theoretical framework developed above, the second half of this paper analyzes how two approaches—geological disposal (GD) and interim storage (IS)—embody distinct intergenerational dependencies and ethical dilemmas. Among experts, geological disposal (GD)—the burial of HLW at depths greater than several hundred meters—is widely regarded as the most technically robust solution (Nuclear Energy Agency [NEA],2000; International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],2011). From an ethical standpoint, a growing consensus holds that GD is preferable to alternatives such as interim storage (IS), since it avoids placing a burden on future generations (NEA,1995).

However, some scholars in intergenerational and environmental ethics have critiqued GD as autonomy-infringing, while framing IS as autonomy-enhancing. They argue that GD removes human control over HLW and prevents future generations from responding to emergencies or making use of HLW as a resource (Fuji-Johnson,2008; Shrader-Frechette,1993; Teramoto,2018). By contrast, IS allows for continued active management and retrieval, as well as ongoing research and development that might open new technological pathways, thus offering future generations more flexibility and options.

Yet, as this paper argues, it is inadequate to evaluate autonomy solely in terms of preserving future generations’ options. Both GD and IS must be understood as transgenerational projects that span more than a century. From the perspective of the expanded framework of intergenerational domination introduced earlier, a more nuanced understanding is required—one that accounts for the tripartite relationship among the CG, SGs, and RGs, and the intergenerational distribution of autonomy and dependency. This paper applies that framework to both GD and IS, and further analyzes reversibility & retrievability (R&R) as an increasingly important policy concept in the implementation of GD.

There is considerable variation among scholars regarding what constitutes arbitrariness (Lovett,2012; Lovett & Pettit,2009). Pettit’s own definition evolved over time—from initially defining arbitrary power as power that “fails to track the interests of the other agent,” to later emphasizing the absence of “recourse to venues for contestation and the ability to control the interfering agent” (Beckman,2016; Blunt,2015; Pettit,2008). Lovett focuses on whether the actions of the more powerful party are constrained by effective rules, procedures, or shared goals: that is, domination arises when these constraints are absent (Lovett,2012). A typical example would be parent-child relationships: although a power imbalance exists, if parents are constrained by laws (e.g., against abuse or neglect), then the relationship may not count as domination. The absence of such constraints would constitute what Smith calls institutional failure (Smith,2012; see also: Hemmerich,2024; Katz,2019).

Summarizing these debates, most theorists agree that domination hinges on whether interference with B is determined by the whim of A, and whether institutional safeguards exist to limit such arbitrariness.

Originally, the concept of domination was framed with contemporaneous, directly interacting relationships in mind—such as that between a master and a slave. However, scholars have increasingly debated whether domination can also apply to spatially or temporally distant relationships. For instance, a landlord who never visits may still dominate tenants through an agent; or, even after death, an individual might dominate others via instructions encoded in a robot or algorithm. In the case of intergenerational domination, recent studies generally support the view that—with some modifications—Pettit’s framework can be applied to relationships across generations (see Hemmerich,2024; Karnein,2023; Katz,2019).

Similar to traditional theories of intergenerational ethics and justice, many scholars of intergenerational domination conceptually divide the population into the current generation (CG) and future generations and assume a one-way relationship in which the former dominates the latter. Given the irreversibility of time, many thinkers, such as Parfit (1984), O’Neil (1996), Rawls (1999), Page (2006), and Gardiner (2004), take for granted that the CG’s decisions inevitably affect future generations, thereby placing future generations in a structurally dependent position. This temporal dependence justifies the need for institutional mechanisms that constrain the CG’s arbitrary exercise of power over future generations. These may include, for example, future generations’ representation (Gonzalez-Ricoy & Gosseries,2016), constitutional provisions (Gosseries,2008), and stricter regulations (or even prohibition) of geoengineering (Smith,2012).

This section argues for the need to expand the concept of intergenerational domination to better understand the complex temporality and intergenerational relationships involved in transgenerational projects. A transgenerational project refers to a project that spans approximately 100 years or more and requires sustained commitment from multiple successive generations between its initiation and completion. Throughout human history, societies have undertaken and completed various types of transgenerational projects, including military fortifications, religious edifices, cultural landmarks, and large-scale infrastructure.

For example, construction of the Great Wall of China began during the Spring and Autumn period (8th century BCE) and continued intermittently through to the Ming Dynasty (14th–17th centuries). Many cathedrals in Europe took more than a century to build: the Sagrada Família is expected to take approximately 150 years to complete, and the Cologne Cathedral underwent more than 600 years of construction.2The case study addressed in the second half of this paper—radioactive waste management—can also be regarded as a representative example of a (post-)modern transgenerational project.

Due to their long duration, transgenerational projects challenge the conventional binary division between the CG and future generations. Take the Sagrada Família as an example: construction began in the late 19th century. From the standpoint of that generation, today’s population would have been regarded as “future generations.” However, more than a century later, construction is still ongoing, and we—today’s generation—are actively involved in it. The project is expected to be completed in the 2030s, and people living after that time will enjoy the product of this architectural undertaking. (Of course, post-completion maintenance will continue for the foreseeable future.) However, if our generation were to abandon the project and allow the building to deteriorate, future generations would be unable to benefit from this cultural heritage.

From the standpoint of the original CG in the 19th century, there is a significant difference between future generations expected to commit to project completion and more distant future generations who merely receive its outcome. These groups differ in how they relate to the project, to the CG, and in how they exercise autonomy. To theorize domination in the context of transgenerational projects, we must improve the conceptual resolution of how we address such complex temporality.

Subsequent generations (SGs) who are expected to commit to and carry the project forward.

Remote generations (RGs) who will ultimately experience the outcomes—positive or negative—of the project’s completion or failure.

This framework enables us to introduce new perspectives into the discourse on intergenerational domination, including the nature of the CG–SG relationship as it pertains to project implementation, the implications of success or failure in the CG–SG’s collective endeavor for RGs, and how such outcomes relate to issues of whim and intentionality. The next section explores the CG–SG relationship within transgenerational projects in more detail.

The long timespan and complex temporality of transgenerational projects complicate the relationship between the CG and SGs. As seen in the example of the Sagrada Família, whether a project initiated by the CG reaches completion depends greatly on whether SGs continue to commit to it. SGs may, for various reasons, decide to suspend funding, reallocate human resources, or even terminate the project altogether. In this respect, the CG is structurally dependent on SGs. Expressly, while the CG holds a temporally prior position over SGs, it also depends on SGs for the project’s implementation and completion. Thus, the CG–SG relationship involves both asymmetry and mutual dependency.

Although intergenerational reciprocity has been discussed by a few scholars in the fields of intergenerational justice and ethics, these discussions—such as Thompson’s notion of “life-time transcending interests” (Thompson,2009) or Scheffler’s idea of “evaluative dependency” (Scheffler,2018) —typically concernsymbolicrecognition or the desire for posthumous affirmation (see also: Rulli,2021). By contrast, the form of dependency observed in transgenerational projects isoperational: it concerns the very feasibility of the project itself. Importantly, the domination of the CG by SGs in this context does not require a commitment to posthumous interests in the symbolic or recognition-based sense. Rather, the CG undertakes a transgenerational project precisely because it considers the anticipated outcome as part of its current responsibility or purpose. For instance, in the case of HLW, initiating a disposal or long-term storage program is seen as a way for the CG to assume ethical responsibility for the consequences of nuclear energy use. If SGs subsequently abandon or redirect the project, CGs’ attempts to fulfill this responsibility are frustrated. In this sense, the CG’s ethical agency is rendered structurally vulnerable to SGs’ decisions. Therefore, what is at stake is not merely symbolic recognition, but the practical realization of the CG’s commitments—highlighting a form of domination that is operational rather than posthumous.

The existence of this form of reciprocity is a necessary condition for the planning and execution of any transgenerational project.

This section argues that in transgenerational projects, even the good intentions of SGs and well-designed institutional arrangements created by the CG can fail due to uncontrollable circumstances, generating a new kind of domination that cannot be captured by the concept of arbitrariness alone.

Historically, many transgenerational projects have been abandoned mid-course due to various external factors. In Japan, for instance, many local festivals and cultural heritage —often maintained over centuries—have faced existential threats due to the catastrophic tsunami in 2011 (Littlejohn,2021; Takakura,2016). The construction of the Sagrada Família has experienced interruptions and delays due to civil war, pandemics, and other crises. Scheffler has noted that “only the rich are lucky enough to be able to devote themselves to long-term activities” (Scheffler,2018), suggesting that evaluative reciprocity, as he envisions it, is unlikely to function when SGs lack the necessary resources or stability.

These examples suggest that even when the CG anticipates the interests of SGs and builds institutions to facilitate smooth project execution, and even when SGs intend to remain engaged, external factors may make sustained involvement practically impossible.

Here, I define contingency as those events or conditions that lie beyond the control of any particular generation yet significantly affect the continuity or feasibility of a transgenerational project. Examples include war, disaster, accident, economic collapse, and demographic shifts such as declining birth rates and population aging. These events compromise the foundations of projectual reciprocity. Such contingencies are outside the scope of SGs’ agency—they lack “up-to-usness;” thus, it would be inaccurate to label them as “arbitrary.” Still, insofar as they obstruct the realization of a transgenerational project and, as discussed later, result in domination over RGs, they cannot be excluded from the normative analysis.

In the case of buildings or artworks, projects might resume after temporary suspension. However, in domains such as radioactive waste management, the failure or suspension of a project can have significant negative consequences for the well-being and environment of RGs. Therefore, when theorizing transgenerational projects, it is insufficient to analyze domination solely in terms of two elements: whim (arbitrary will) and institutional constraint. We must also account for the role of contingency.

Mere epistemic unpredictability—when agents cannot foresee whether they will be affected or not.

Beckman focuses on the second type as relevant to domination. However, this paper argues that the first type—the uncertainty rooted in situational unpredictability—must also be considered. In projects lasting over a century, it is impossible to predict future developments with certainty. Such radical uncertainty must itself be treated as a foundational premise when theorizing domination in the context of transgenerational projects.

Thus, in the context of transgenerational projects, domination cannot be fully theorized without accounting for contingency—the unpredictable, often uncontrollable factors that render institutional safeguards ineffective.

To summarize the argument so far: in transgenerational projects, the relationship between the CG and SGs is not simply one of domination by the CG. Rather, SGs may exert virtual contestability over the CG, giving rise to a fragile but operative form of projectual reciprocity. However, because transgenerational projects unfold over a century or more, we must also take seriously the possibility that this reciprocity may fail, either through SGs’ discretionary choices or due to contingency.

If a transgenerational project initiated by the CG is irreversibly abandoned by one of the SGs—for example, due to war or other external disruptions—then the project will never be completed, and RGs will be unable to reap its intended benefits. Even if the project proceeds successfully, RGs remain structurally dependent on SGs’ actions. From the neo-republican perspective, which emphasizes capacity-based over harm-based relationships, it is precisely this structural dependence—where the well-being and environment of RGs hinge on SGs’ ongoing commitment—that constitutes a form of domination, even if that failure is not due to SGs’ whim or is not under their control.

They are entrusted with carrying the transgenerational project forward, thereby making the CG dependent on SGs.

They are in a position to dominate RGs, whose future well-being depends on SGs’ performance.

This entangled structure of domination produces a normative dilemma between preserving SGs’ autonomy and minimizing domination over RGs. If the CG imposes only weak pre-commitments, SGs retain broad freedom to revise or abandon the project. This flexibility becomes especially crucial when SGs encounters contingency, which may justifiably shift priorities away from transgenerational project continuation. However, the greater SGs’ discretionary space, the more deeply RGs’ fate becomes contingent on SGs’ decisions. Expressly, preserving SGs’ access to options—the traditional definition of autonomy—comes at the cost of increased domination over RGs. We illustrate this trade-off concretely below by describing a scenario in which succeeding generations’ flexibility in reallocating resources may leave future generations structurally dominated. Consider a long-term radioactive waste storage project where the commitment to develop future disposal methods depends on sustained political and financial support over several decades. If a succeeding generation reallocates resources away from this commitment due to shifting societal priorities, future generations may be left with indefinite monitoring responsibilities and no viable disposal pathway. Their exposure to long-term risks would then depend on prior generations’ discretionary decisions—an arrangement that reflects structural domination. It is important to note that our analysis does not rely on a harm-based account of well-being. While certain phrases—such as “well-being” or “negative consequences”—are used descriptively, the ethical concern lies not in the presence or absence of material harm per se, but in thedegree of structural dependenceremote generations bear due to the contingent actions of their predecessors. (We return to such examples in detail in Sect.Radioactive Waste Management and Intergenerational Domination).

Domination from SGs to the CG: This arises when the CG’s project depends heavily on SGs’ ongoing commitment. In such cases, even unintentional withdrawal by SGs—due to contingency—can undermine the CG’s efforts. To mitigate this, the CG should design transgenerational projects that are resilient to future uncertainties, thereby reducing structural dependence on SGs’ uninterrupted support.

Domination from the CG and SGs to RGs: Since RGs do not directly participate in the transgenerational project, it passively bears the consequences of the project’s success or failure. When excessive leeway is preserved for SGs, the feasibility of completing the transgenerational project becomes more dependent on SGs’ choices, thereby structurally exposing RGs to collective domination by the CG and SGs. Therefore, it is crucial to strike an appropriate balance between rigidity and flexibility when designing transgenerational project, and to ensure that the projectual reciprocity between the CG and SGs functions effectively. Doing so minimizes domination over RGs.

In sum, subsequent generations occupy a structurally complex position in transgenerational projects: they are subjected to pre-commitments by the past, entrusted with carrying them forward, and capable—whether deliberately or not—of structurally determining the conditions under which remote generations may thrive or falter. Even in the absence of material harm, this structural dependence constitutes a form of domination. Therefore, their autonomy must be redefined not as mere access to options, but as a form of responsible freedom, embedded in a multi-layered structure of domination and dependency.

This expanded view of intergenerational autonomy resonates with what has been called the “relational turn” in contemporary ethics and political philosophy. While much of the literature on autonomy has traditionally emphasized individual agency and present-time self-determination (Dworkin,1988; Frankfurt,1988), recent feminist and post-Western perspectives have reframed autonomy as socially embedded and historically conditioned (Mackenzie & Stoljar,2000; Gómez-Vírseda et al.,2019; Anderson,2020). Extending this relational perspective across time, transgenerational projects reveal how autonomy is shaped—and potentially constrained—by inherited commitments and forward-looking dependencies. In this sense, the intergenerational structure of domination and responsibility offers a distinctive temporal dimension to relational autonomy.

The next section applies this expanded concept of domination to the case of radioactive waste management.

The peaceful use of nuclear energy inevitably generates various forms of radioactive waste, among which high-level radioactive waste (HLW) poses the most persistent and complex challenges in terms of long-term management and disposal. HLW refers to different substances depending on national nuclear fuel cycle policies: in “once-through” countries such as Finland and Sweden, it denotes spent fuel, whereas in “closed fuel cycle” countries like France and Japan, it refers to vitrified waste after reprocessing (NEA,1989). In either case, HLW exhibits such high levels of radioactivity that it takes tens of thousands of years to subside to levels considered safe for human exposure.

The internationally established principle, as stated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP,1998), holds that “individuals and populations in the future should be afforded at least the same level of protection as the current generation.” However, due to the extreme longevity of HLW’s hazard, this principle cannot be fulfilled through conventional engineering methods that rely on institutional control or ongoing human intervention.

In response to this challenge, geological disposal (GD) has been in development since the 1970s as a strategy to isolate HLW by placing it several hundred meters underground, encased in both engineered and natural barriers. This approach is designed to ensure the protection of future generations without depending on human agency, thereby realizing a concept known as “passive safety” (NEA,2007; Schröder et al.,2016). Alongside the design of such facilities, safety assessment methodologies have been developed to scientifically justify their long-term safety, while itsdemonstrationis impossible (NEA,2012).

The IAEA defines disposal as the final step in radioactive waste management, executed without the intention of retrieval. Accordingly, the IAEA asserts that “radioactive waste shall be managed in such a way that will not impose undue burdens on future generations” (IAEA,1995). In line with this, many experts view GD as the most technically feasible and ethically desirable solution, as it relieves future generations of the long-term responsibility of waste stewardship (NEA,1995). Countries such as Finland and Sweden have already selected sites and are moving forward with construction.

Over the past decades, a substantial body of ethical reflection has accumulated among experts and practitioners involved in radioactive waste management and GD. Since the 1950s, following the discovery of radioactive liquid waste leakage at the Hanford site in the United States, the technical feasibility of disposing of HLW in geological formations—especially in salt formations—has been explored. Even at that early stage, ethical considerations were explicitly raised. The 1957 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences posed a foundational question: “where and how can we put wastes into the ground economically and under conditions which will not jeopardize the rights of others, especially in populated areas” (NAS,1957).

In 1977, the OECD/NEA emphasized that while storage inevitably depends on active institutional management, geological disposal was seen as ethically preferable precisely because it does not require continued oversight and can isolate waste from the human environment without further intervention (NEA,1977). The 1982 NEA “Coady Report” further elaborated ethical principles for radioactive waste disposal, including concerns about intergenerational responsibility and the advantages of GD as a passive safety system (NEA,1982). By 1995, a more comprehensive NEA report on the environmental and ethical foundations of GD argued that long-term strategies should avoid relying on the assumption of sustained social or institutional continuity, or indefinite technological progress. It further suggested that ethical analysis must balance the avoidance of unfairly constraining future generations’ freedom of choice with the imperative to avoid imposing excessive burdens on them. Under these conditions, geological disposal was considered, once again, to be an ethically justified path (NEA,1995). The eventual preference for GD reflects, in part, long-standing ethical judgments about minimizing dependence on future societal stability—a concern that resonates with the neo-republican analysis developed in this paper.

Nevertheless, scholars in environmental ethics and science and technology studies have raised concerns about both the technical robustness and ethical justifiability of GD (e.g., Kinsella,2020; Macfarlane,2003; Shrader-Frechette,1993). They argue that the irreversible nature of GD, combined with our limited predictive knowledge, may cause unacceptable risks to remote future generations and problems in terms of intergenerational justice and equity. Numerous uncertainties remain: the long-term behavior of radionuclides in geological strata, the risk of human intrusion, and the unknowability of future values and societal structures (Hadjilambrinos,2000). Additionally, some materials within HLW could potentially become valuable resources for future generations (Tondel & Lindahl,2019). By permanently sealing HLW through GD, the CG may foreclose future technological opportunities, thereby unjustifiably restricting the freedom of choice of future generations (Damveld & van den Berg,2000).

As an alternative to permanent disposal, some scholars advocate interim storage (IS)—either on the surface or in near-surface facilities—in a retrievable manner until better technologies can be developed (Bunn et al.,2001; Shrader-Frechette,1993). The term “interim” vividly reflects the strategy’s non-final nature. IS is not intended to be a permanent solution but rather to buy time, ensuring that future generations retain freedom of choice while better options are explored. Thus, IS requires sustained human agency to create pathways toward yet-undeveloped technical innovations.

Continuous investment in research and development until better technologies are available.

Maintenance of HLW in actively controlled, retrievable storage.

Implementation of “rolling stewardship,” a system whereby knowledge, resources, and responsibilities are handed over democratically to successive generations—ensuring that “nuclear wastes are never placed beyond human control and are never left unattended” (Edwards & Del Tredici,2013).

In contrast to GD, which is designed to be safe regardless of future human action, IS places its trust in the agency of future generations to manage evolving uncertainties. IS is thus regarded as a way of passing down a world that preserves “equal opportunity” for future generations (NEA,1995).

Much of the scholarly attention in intergenerational ethics and justice surrounding HLW has focused on its extreme long-term radiological toxicity—spanning tens of thousands of years—and how the decisions of the present generation affect future generations. Reflecting this long timeframe, some conceptually divide future people into generational categories based on their placement on the timeline and examining the ethical distribution of risks and benefits among them. Some reports defending the ethical soundness of GD draw a distinction between relatively near-term and remote future generations, suggesting that greater protection for the former is acceptable given the decreasing certainty of scientific predictions over time (Swedish National Council for Nuclear Waste,2005; NAPA,1997). In contrast, scholars in environmental ethics and philosophy of technology have criticized this view, arguing that the ignorance of long-term consequences does not justify devaluing remote future generations, who are the most vulnerable due to their complete passivity in relation to decisions made in the past (Shrader-Frechette,2002; Taebi,2010). Kermisch and her colleagues argue that ethical assessment of HLW disposal options should distinguish between near and remote future generations based on the durability of collective memory regarding waste and its location (Kermisch,2016; Kermisch et al.,2016).

While these contributions offer important insights, most treat GD as a kind of one-off decision and focus primarily on its impact on future generationsafterthe facility is closed. However, as discussed below, the actualimplementationof both GD and IS represents a long-term sociotechnical project that spans multiple generations.

Although GD is often imagined as a final act that forecloses future generations’ choices, this is an oversimplification. If the current generation adopts a GD policy, it entrusts successive generations with a wide range of responsibilities: further technological development and performance assessments, site selection, licensing, construction, operation, closure, and possibly even post-closure monitoring. The time span from site selection to closure is generally expected to exceed 100 years, and post-closure monitoring may continue far longer to ensure technological and social confidence in safety claims (NEA,2004).6Thus, the implementation of GD is not a discrete event but a multi-generational enterprise that depends on the actions and decisions of several future generations.

Likewise, choosing the IS option requires a comparable time scale. Since no definitive alternative technological pathway has been established to replace GD, any commitment to IS inherently demands long-term investment in research and development. Among the proposed alternatives, partitioning and transmutation (P&T) is often considered a promising candidate (Taebi,2010). Even if this option proves viable, it would still require roughly 100 years for P&T to reach commercial maturity (IAEA,2004).7Moreover, deploying P&T at scale would require extensive infrastructural development: new reactor designs, advanced fuel cycle technologies, specialized regulatory systems, trained personnel, secured funding, and so forth. All of these imply long-term, large-scale societal commitments.

In any case, the search for technological alternatives will require at least a century, during which successive generations must proactively commit themselves to research and development as well as the safe, active management of HLW. Such commitments are not automatic; they depend on deliberate decisions to allocate physical, economic, and cognitive resources across generations. In this sense, choosing IS today means drawing future generations into an open-ended long-term project that maintains active human agency until better technical solutions are realized.

In short, both GD and IS are transgenerational projects that demand 100 years or more to be fully carried out. Given that even contemporary infrastructure projects often face delays and long-term challenges (Lehtonen et al.,2017), the primary difficulty is not only HLW’s longevity as a hazard but the long timespan of implementation itself.

The current generation (CG), which makes initial policy decisions.

Subsequent generations (SGs), who inherit and implement those policies.

Remote generations (RGs), who will passively bear the positive or negative outcomes of these projects.

Kuppler and Hocke (2019) offer a precedent that also focuses on the duration of HLW project implementation; they examine the long-term planning of GD and its required governance structures. While their work offers valuable insights, it does not deeply engage with ethical relations among the CG, SGs, and RGs. In contrast, this study seeks to enhance the temporal resolution of generational dynamics in project implementation and offers a more nuanced understanding of the entangled dominations involved.

The autonomy of future generations has been widely discussed in the ethical examination of radioactive waste management (Bråkenhielm,2015). Traditional ethical discussions have largely and rather simplistically construed GD as infringing upon the autonomy of future generations, whereas IS has been regarded as conferring autonomy (Fuji-Johnson,2008). Similarly, a Japanese ethicist argues that IS is a more ethically desirable strategy in terms of intergenerational equity regarding the “right of choice,” whereas GD focuses only on the fair distribution of burdens (Teramoto,2018). Such arguments are seemingly based on the premise that the autonomy of future generations can be secured by ensuring a wide range of technical options for radioactive waste management, from which they may autonomously choose.

However, as discussed in the previous chapter, the traditional view that equates autonomy with access to options fails to adequately capture the complex relationships of entangled domination. Therefore, this section starts by reexamining IS—conventionally regarded as autonomy-conferring—from the perspective of domination.

IS aims to keep the door open for the development of alternative technological fixes to GD. If successful, this could drastically reduce the potential radiological impact on RGs. In this light, IS seems to respect the autonomy of future generations more than GD, which forecloses such possibilities. However, there is no guarantee that such a “magical” technology will be found, nor that SGs will continue to allocate the necessary resources over a century or more. Moreover, HLW remains in a retrievable and hazardous state, requiring each generation to engage in its active care. Any significant reduction in the allocation of resources—financial, human, or otherwise—could increase the risk not only to RGs but also to the SGs.

Given the century-long timespan of this transgenerational project, various unforeseen contingencies may arise. Wars, disasters, or economic downturns might deprioritize HLW research and development, leading to delays or abandonment. Indeed, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent nuclear disaster caused major setbacks not only in Japan but also internationally in nuclear energy use and its research policies. Whether SGs withdraw from the pre-commitment of IS intentionally or under external pressure, such a structure introduces uncertainty into the transgenerational project and heightens the domination of RGs.

These concerns are further intensified when we consider the broader political contingencies that may destabilize long-term IS strategies. The viability of maintaining interim storage over a century often rests on assumptions of sustained institutional stability, security, and funding. However, such conditions cannot be guaranteed. Recent geopolitical events—such as the military occupation of Ukrainian nuclear facilities—have demonstrated that even fundamental international norms can be breached. In a similar scenario, the perceived threat to the security of surface-stored HLW may compel governments to accelerate disposal measures without adequate deliberation or technological readiness. This illustrates how the structural preconditions for exercising intergenerational autonomy—such as continuity of governance and social investment—can be undermined by contingencies beyond any generation’s control. Therefore, ethical analysis must account for these non-ideal conditions, which can transform nominal flexibility into vulnerability and autonomy into dependency.

As noted earlier, neo-republicanism does not assess domination based on whether actual harm occurs, but rather on whether one’s future is arbitrarily subject to the will of others. In this view, the CG’s choice of IS creates a domination structure in which the radiological safety of RG is heavily dependent on SGs’ discretion. Expressly, IS gives rise to a structure where the CG and SGs collectively dominate RGs.

Conversely, if the CG tries to prevent such outcomes by establishing a rigid institutional framework that mandates continued research and development regardless of contingency, this will increase domination of SGs by the CG. While a degree of rigidity is allowed in intergenerational constitutionalism, excessive pre-commitment infringes upon the sovereignty of SGs (see Gosseries,2008; Beckman,2016).

In this way, it becomes impossible to minimize both forms of domination simultaneously. If we define autonomy as non-domination rather than mere access to options, the conventional view that IS is autonomy-conferring for future generations must be reconsidered.

In contrast to IS, which requires a high degree of sustained human involvement with HLW, GD adopts a strategy of gradually reducing the need for human agency.

The goal of GD is to ensure complete passive safety without dependence on the active control of future humans (NEA,1982;2011). SGs are expected to gradually reduce the extent of human agency required to achieve this goal. However, this elimination of human agency is not realized immediately after the policy decision to pursue GD; rather, it unfolds transgenerationally through a series of decisions. For example, after the designated amount of HLW has been emplaced, the generation at that time must decide whether to fully close the repository, to maintain a certain level of retrievability, and to what extent post-closure monitoring measures should be implemented. It may be the first time in human history that we voluntarily relinquish our decision-making agency. Given the lack of historical precedent, this project must be pursued with great caution and over an extended period. This concern may underlie why many countries have adopted “stepwise,” “phased,” or “adaptive” approaches (The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management,2018; National Research Council,2003; Nuclear Waste Management Organization,2005). As will be discussed in the next chapter, the growing international interest in reversibility and retrievability (R&R) can also be interpreted as an institutional and technical response to the challenge of relinquishing human control.

Expressly, selecting the GD option implies that the current and several subsequent generations commit to a long-term project whose ultimate aim is the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of opportunities to exercise human agency. These generations are expected to make decisions over time about how and to what extent they will reduce their agency, reflecting the scientific knowledge and social values of their own era.

From the perspective of domination, the selection of GD—which is at least conceptually a mature option—leads to a reduction in the degree of care or commitment required from SGs by the CG, thereby also reducing the likelihood that SGs will unilaterally withdraw from the project. Moreover, as we move further into the future, the CG’s predictive capacity diminishes, and the probability of SGs encountering unforeseen contingencies increases. In parallel, GD project can become more robust to such contingencies by reducing SGs’ involvement over time. In this way, by lowering dependency on SGs for the completion of the transgenerational project, GD can also reduce the domination of RGs.

Thus, GD not only aims to achieve physical separation between HLW and the human environment, but also to reduce the interaction between radioactive waste and the more volatile dimensions of human society and political conditions, thereby creating a system less vulnerable to external disruptions.

In summary, if autonomy is understood in neo-republican terms as non-domination, then GD may have greater potential than IS to reduce entangled domination in a balanced way, with careful attention to the complex temporality of transgenerational projects. That said, it cannot be denied that GD may still contain autonomy-infringing aspects, particularly in terms of limiting the options available to SGs.

The international discourse on R&R reflects an attempt to mitigate the autonomy-infringing implications of geological disposal. Often discussed in technical or public-acceptance terms, R&R can also be interpreted as a response to the ethical challenge of intergenerational domination. This perspective opens further normative questions regarding its design and function, which I address in the following section.

Reversibility: the ability to reconsider and reverse the course during the development and implementation of a disposal facility.

Retrievability: the ability to retrieve waste after it has been placed.

This reflects the idea that while GD is currently considered the best option and is being implemented, the ability of SGs to exercise choice should be preserved at least until the facility is closed. It also aims to build stakeholder confidence in the system’s passive safety. Conversely, ensuring R&R will increase the frequency and extent of interactions between human society and HLW, thereby raising critical concerns in terms of both safety and security. Consequently, recent debates have centered around the appropriate scope, modalities, and temporal limits of R&R implementation (NEA,2015).

In related academic fields, the importance of maintaining reversibility and adaptability has been emphasized to resist the tendency of large-scale technologies to become entrenched in a technological monoculture through various forms of commitment—social, legal, organizational, and political (Walker,2000). In the field of science and technology studies, the societal decision-making and participatory process of radioactive waste management have attracted scholarly attention (Hietala & Geysmans,2022; Lehtonen,2010; Solomon et al.,2010). Stirling distinguishes between technological appraisal and commitment and advocates “opening up” the range of technological choices rather than “closing down” prematurely (Stirling,2008). He emphasizes the importance of maintaining reversibility and adaptability, especially in large-scale technologies, to avoid technological lock-in (Parotte et al.,2024; Stirling,2008).

While these perspectives are critical—especially the claim that introducing R&R may paradoxically deepen lock-in by making it more likely that agents favor geological disposal (Bergen,2016)—complete reversibility may not be feasible in practice due to accumulated commitments such as infrastructure, human capital, and institutional settings. If we adhere strictly to the classical view of autonomy as access to options, then “the freedom of every generation of the human species is inevitably restricted by its predecessors” (Beckman,2016). This leads to paralysis in decision-making. As this paper has shown, without some level of commitment, transgenerational projects cannot be sustained, nor can domination over RGs be minimized. Therefore, rather than endlessly preserving options, we need to consider how to design commitments that can be made responsibly and revisited if necessary.

Some countries have already sought to address intergenerational concerns through policies that combine geological disposal with designed flexibility. For instance, in France, based on nation-wide discussion since 1990s, legislation in 2006 defined reversibility as a fundamental principle of disposal, explicitly emphasizing the ethical imperative of allowing future generations to revise earlier decisions in light of technological or societal change. Similarly, Canada’s Adaptive Phased Management (APM), adopted in 2007, proposes a centralized repository to be developed over time while maintaining decision points that allow successive generations to reassess strategies. These approaches demonstrate efforts to operationalize flexibility without entirely suspending long-term commitments—aligning closely with the normative balance proposed in this paper.

This echoes the constitutionalism debate: while institutionalizing the rules to track future generations’ interests in a rigid form (e.g., constitution) may be desirable in terms of mitigating arbitrariness, imposing overly rigid constraints on SGs increases the CG-to-SG domination (see Beckman,2016; Pettit,1997; Katz,2019). Thus, striking a balance between institutional rigidity and revisability is crucial. Our knowledge of GD is far from perfect; therefore, in the early stages of transgenerational project design, flexibility must be ensured. As our scientific, technical, and social understanding solidifies, commitments can gradually be made more rigid. The relationship between confidence in knowledge, decisional agency, and domination is a promising area for further philosophical and policy-oriented investigation.

This study has proposed a reconceptualization of intergenerational domination by extending neo-republican theory to the domain of transgenerational projects. Through the introduction of a tripartite generational framework—comprising the current generation (CG), subsequent generations (SGs), and remote generations (RGs)—it has demonstrated the limitations of existing binary CG–future generations approaches in capturing the complex temporalities and structural interdependencies that characterize long-term undertakings such as radioactive waste management.

By analyzing the two principal policy options in high-level radioactive waste management—geological disposal (GD) and interim storage (IS)—this paper has shown how each option gives rise to distinct forms of entangled domination. Contrary to conventional accounts that regard IS as autonomy-enhancing and GD as autonomy-infringing, the neo-republican lens reveals that IS may impose structurally significant burdens on SGs and RGs by increasing their exposure to contingency and dependence on sustained agency. GD, by contrast, while limiting access to options, may offer a more robust strategy for minimizing domination across generational lines by reducing future dependency through the gradual implementation of passive safety. This paper argues that ethical concern lies not in the presence or absence of material harm per se, but in the extent to which RGs are structurally subordinated to the discretionary actions of their predecessors.

Admittedly, in some cases like radioactive waste management, the possible consequences for RGs may involve severe material harm, especially if projects such as IS are abandoned or mismanaged. This contrasts with other transgenerational projects, like cultural construction, where the potential losses are largely symbolic. While this paper maintains a structural rather than harm-based conception of domination, it acknowledges that the magnitude and nature of possible consequences can amplify the ethical stakes and call for proportionate precaution.

Furthermore, the study has reinterpreted reversibility and retrievability (R&R) not merely as regulatory provisions or tools for stakeholder confidence, but as institutional mechanisms that enhance the contestability of SG. In this sense, R&R enables SG to affirm or challenge inherited commitments, thereby constituting an intergenerational practice of responsible autonomy.

This paper has primarily focused on HLW arising from conventional large-scale nuclear reactors. However, emerging technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs) also raise some questions regarding radioactive waste management (see Krall et al.,2022). Extending the present analysis to such novel developments remains an important task for future research.

The three-generation model developed in this paper—comprising the current, subsequent, and remote generations—offers a higher temporal resolution than conventional binary frameworks. However, it remains an analytical approximation, shaped by the assumption that transgenerational projects such as GD can be eventually completed, allowing human involvement to cease. This institutional logic enables a relatively clear conceptual distinction between SGs (those actively engaged in project continuation) and RGs (those indirectly affected after completion). Yet, in other domains—such as climate change adaptation or certain infrastructures—projects may unfold without a clearly definable endpoint, requiring ongoing human stewardship across generations. In such cases, the boundary between SGs and RGs becomes blurred, and the potential for remote generations to exercise autonomy and agency becomes more salient. Future research could explore how different types of transgenerational projects—those with open-ended versus terminal trajectories—affect the structure of intergenerational domination and the ethical status of remote generations.

In addition, while this paper has primarily focused on the intergenerational dynamics among human actors, the GD of HLW also relies on the agency of non-human entities—geological formations, hydrological systems, and the radiological decay of the waste itself. Insights from STS, particularly actor-network theory, suggest that agency can be distributed across human and non-human actors (Latour,2005). From this perspective, GD can be understood as delegating protective functions to the geological environment, which in turn becomes a key participant in safeguarding future generations (see Schröder,2016). Future work could extend the notion of entangled domination to consider how such material agencies shape or mitigate the structures of power and dependency analyzed here.
