The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the breadth and scope of the existing literature on eHealth in older adults, with a particular focus on access, uptake, usability, and outcomes related to eHealth technologies. The review aims to map the existing evidence, identify research gaps, and from these, analyze the factors that influence eHealth literacy in older people and inform future research and interventions aimed at increasing eHealth engagement in the older population.

A scoping review was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley's framework. Relevant peer-reviewed articles published over 10 years between 2015 and 2024 were screened from multiple electronic databases. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a focus on older adults and their interactions with eHealth technologies.

A scoping review of literature from PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EBSCO identified 2247 studies, with 25 full-text articles published in the past 10 years. Findings reveal that e-health literacy decreases with age and lower education levels. External factors such as social support, technology access, and healthcare policies fluctuate with economic conditions, while internal factors like cognition, attitudes, and motivation are influenced by age and life experiences.

eHealth literacy holds promise for enhancing healthcare access and outcomes among older adults. However, significant barriers remain, particularly regarding usability, accessibility, and digital literacy. Future research should focus on targeted education and longitudinal evaluation to better understand and support older adults’ engagement with eHealth technologies.

Population aging is becoming one of the major social challenges of the 21st century.1The United Nations reported that 1 in 11 people was aged 65 or older in 20192; by 2050, the ratio is expected to be 1 in 6. With this demographic shift, the prevalence of chronic diseases among older adults is expected to increase dramatically. Available data emphasize the importance of health literacy for reducing comorbidities as well as enhancing the prevention and management of chronic diseases.3Traditionally measured at the individual level, health literacy refers to individual cognitive abilities that facilitate accessing, understanding, and utilizing health information for informed decision-making and the successful management of health.4Sørensen et al. expanded this concept by identifying three domains of health literacy: healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion.5These domains illustrate the multi-dimensionality of health literacy and the necessity of addressing them, considering the challenges that an aging population presents.

The rapid advancement of technology has transformed the Internet into a primary source of health information due to its accessibility and immediacy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, internet usage for health information surged significantly. According to theInternet World Statisticsreport, global internet users surpassed 5.35 billion at the start of 2024, accounting for 69.4% of the world's population.6While online health information-seeking behavior is often associated with younger generations, an increasing number of older adults are also adopting this practice.7Despite challenges in learning and utilizing digital tools, the adoption rate among older adults has shown remarkable growth. For example, a 2023 report revealed that approximately 3.66 million Chinese individuals aged 60 and above accessed healthcare services via mobile internet, contributing to the total of 414 million healthcare users in the country.8The competence to obtain, understand and apply health information through electronic resources to improve health outcomes is designated as eHealth literacy or digital literacy and was originally conceptualized as e-health literacy by proposing the Lily Model, which consists of six components: traditional literacy, information literacy, media literacy, computer literacy, health literacy and science literacy.9However, this model has predominantly been explored in theoretical discussions, with limited empirical validation.

With a significant change in the availability and application of the power of health information, access to health knowledge from digital information not only opens more convenient and diversified channels for older adults to implement health management10but also empowers their self-care ability11to a certain extent. However, studies show that older adults from different geographical, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds have been found to have very different levels of digital health literacy. This review synthesizes the research on eHealth literacy and older adults’ health outcomes in the past decade. It discusses how older adults use electronic devices to obtain health information today, as well as the different factors influencing this behavior. The results are helpful to understand the state of digital health in the aging population and showcase how eHealth literacy can meet the special health needs that older adults face.

The review aims: (a) to analyze and synthesize the key characteristics of the scientific literature on eHealth literacy published over the past decade, including research methodologies, tools for assessment, sample demographics, fields of study, and publication sources; (b) to explore how individual and societal level factors influence the effectiveness of eHealth education. The main research question can be further divided into the following questions.

Scoping studies have become an increasingly popular approach to synthesizing results from health research, particularly when the objective is to explore broad research areas or identify key concepts and knowledge gaps.12eHealth literacy and its associated factors represent a relatively nascent and interdisciplinary area of research, intersecting health sciences, information technology, and gerontology. Unlike systematic reviews, which are typically designed to answer narrowly defined questions or assess the effectiveness of interventions, scoping reviews are particularly useful for exploring broader research topics. This flexibility allows researchers to map existing knowledge, identify research trends, and highlight knowledge gaps in fields where definitions and frameworks are still evolving. Given the complexity and breadth of eHealth literacy, the scoping review method is well-suited to capture its multifaceted nature and synthesize the diverse findings reported in the literature. In addition, scoping reviews have a particular advantage in integrating conclusions drawn from different methodologies without excluding studies based on a rigorous quality assessment.13By accommodating both quantitative and qualitative data, the scoping review method allows for a richer understanding of how older adults engage with digital health information.

Based on Arksey and O’Malley's 2005 publication of the first methodological framework14for conducting scoping studies serves, as a methodological framework for examining this article. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) acted as a foundation for this scoping review methodology.15Descriptive summaries and inductive analysis are utilized in scoping reviews to synthesize and summarize research findings. Unlike systematic reviews and meta-analyses, by not demand an evaluation of the listed research's methodological quality.16By using this approach, the study provides a comprehensive overview of eHealth literacy research while offering insights into the diverse factors that influence its development and application among older adults. This methodological choice not only aligns with the research objectives but also ensures that the review captures the complexity and breadth of the topic effectively.

Wednesday, March 27, 2024, with key terms: all terms.

To be eligible for inclusion in this review, studies needed to meet the following criteria: involving older people (generally over 55 years of age); studies examining the access, use, usability, or impact of ehealth tools or interventions; published in English between January 2015 and 2024; and studies using qualitative, and quantitative, or mixed methods.

Exclusion criteria included studies that did not focus on e-health (e.g. information and communication technologies in general or non-health-related technologies); articles that were not specific to older people or were not analyzed separately for older people; to maintain a focus on high-quality literature, non-peer-reviewed sources were excluded, including opinion articles, editorials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, letters to the editor, conference abstracts, and unpublished materials; non-English-language publications; and studies that were not available in full text.

This literature review process ultimately yielded 25 studies that met all inclusion criteria and aligned with the research objectives. These studies form the foundation of the analysis.Figure 1presents an overview of the study selection process using the PRISMA flowchart.

From the final set of 25 studies, key characteristics were extracted, including author(s), year of publication, study design, assessment tools, and population details (e.g. age distribution, mean age, and recruitment region). These attributes are visually summarized inFigures 2and3. The data extraction process was conducted independently by two reviewers (YJ, SL), who cross-validated the extracted information. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach a consensus. This approach ensured reproducibility and minimized potential bias in data collection.

The studies were evaluated using the DigComp framework,19which was selected due to its robust structure for assessing digital competence. This framework allowed for a systematic analysis of critical elements, including digital health knowledge among older adults, the interaction between e-health literacy and general health literacy, the scope of e-literacy (e.g. use of smartphones, internet platforms, and e-coaching tools), and factors influencing e-health literacy. These evaluations focused on identifying both pertinent components and scales that could further inform the study's objectives. Where information was ambiguous or insufficiently reported, descriptive and statistical methods were applied to extract additional data, ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the findings.Table 2provides a comprehensive summary of the studies, presenting a clear overview of their methodologies, outcomes, and focus areas.

(1) Participants were skeptical about the potential role of digital health coach, an avatar running on the smartphone, and through the introduction of the potential uses and functions of digital health coaches, began to believe that digital health coaches could provide advice, motivation, monitoring of physical activity, etc., which could help promote healthy aging.

(2) Participants' digital literacy and health awareness played avital role in their understanding and use of digital health coach information.

(1) eHealth literacy showed a mild modest link to a healthy lifestyle, with “motivated to engage with digital services” and “understanding health concepts and language” being particularly important for older adults.

(3) The eHealth literacy features “awareness of sources,” “recognizing quality and meaning,” “perceived efficiency,” and “validating information” all played important roles in explaining and shaping personal health knowledge.

The sample consisted of 25 studies with publication years ranging from 2014 to 2024, having the greatest quantity of published studies in 2022 and the highest quantity of research in Asia (seeFigure 2). Most research used a cross-sectional design (23/25), including 3 mixed studies, 2 qualitative studies, and 17 quantitative studies, while few employed longitudinal (1/25) and retrospective studies (1/25). Most of the studies used raw data, and in only two cases were the database data used for extraction.

Of the 23 articles containing full items of questionnaires, eHEALS (eHealth literacy scale), originally developed by Norman and Skinner,44was the most adopted, with eHEALS, DHLAS (digital health literacy assessment scale) and eHLQ (eHealth literacy questionnaire) being validated.Figure 3shows using the scale of eHealth literacy for older people from the 25 articles; of these, eHEALS was used most for the eHealth Literacy Measurement Scale.

In this review, 13 studies employed sample sizes exceeding 100 participants, while others had smaller sample sizes. Notably, 4 studies included participants older than 60 years, 8 studies included participants over 65 years, and 2 studies focused on individuals aged 55 years and older. However, limited information was available regarding the residential areas of participants, with most studies being concentrated in metropolitan regions. Regarding the assessment tools, 10 studies utilized translated versions of eHealth literacy questionnaires, including 7 translations into Chinese Mandarin. Of these, one translation followed a strict translation process and was validated, while another used a previously translated version. Additionally, two studies employed a Korean translation,45and one study used a Spanish translation.42The remaining four studies relied on translated versions that had been previously validated in other studies.

In the development and validation of the remaining scales, each was constructed and validated independently, ensuring both robustness and relevance. Among these, two scales were derived from big data. One scale was based on the modification of a scale developed by Lim.46Additionally, six scales were self-created and subsequently verified.Table 3provides a summary of the eHealth literacy questionnaires.

The factors influencing obtain to health information via the Web to improve health literacy were addressed to some extent in all 25 of the sample literature. Both internal and external factors were included. Internal factors include sociological factors, perceived behaviors, attitudes, etc., while external factors include social support, availability of equipment, and other related factors. Most studies have used sociological factors as dependent or control variables to investigate how eHealth literacy and health literacy are related and have found that they are mainly related to age, and education. Specifically, it shows that the older the age, the poorer the level of education, the more incidence of chronic ailments, and the greater the level of single-person residence in rural areas, the e-health literacy level is deficient. The impact of gender on it is not uniform, but most of the effects were higher for men than for women. One of them focuses on the heterogeneity of race in the United States with respect to searching for health behaviors via the Internet. Whereas positive behavioral effects, self-efficacy, and perceived reliability act as mediators to influence this eHealth literacy to health literacy-related relationship. And for external factors, social support is indispensable.Figure 4summarizes the factors.

Our review identified 25 studies that examined eHealth literacy in older adults, including 20 quantitative studies. Two qualitative studies, three mixed-methods studies. Additionally, an overview study provided broader insights into the topic. For each study, we listed the objectives, impact variables, and key findings. For quantitative studies, we specifically extracted data on eHealth literacy questionnaires and the factors influencing eHealth literacy. This review holds critical significance for public health and digital inclusion in the context of the global trend of population aging. As the proportion of older adults continues to grow worldwide, enhancing eHealth literacy is increasingly recognized as a vital pathway to improving overall health literacy and influencing health outcomes. Understanding the factors that contribute to or hinder eHealth literacy among older adults is not only important for advancing health education strategies but also for addressing broader public health challenges associated with an aging population. By systematically analyzing these studies, this review highlights the pressing need for targeted interventions and policy efforts to bridge the digital divide among older adults. It underscores the role of tailored eHealth education programs in empowering older adults to engage effectively with digital health tools and resources, thereby improving their access to healthcare information and promoting better health management.

Our review revealed that the overall level of eHealth literacy among older adults remains relatively inadequate. This insufficiency was consistently associated with internal factors such as aging-related physiological and cognitive decline, limited formal education, and socioeconomic factors. In reviewing the article, 21 studies reported a negative association between age and eHealth literacy, while 23 studies identified a strong positive link between higher education and eHealth literacy performance.

Socioeconomic factors, such as marital status and socioeconomic level, also exert a notable influence on eHealth literacy. Gender differences, however, present mixed findings across studies: Several studies report20,47,48that men demonstrate higher awareness of eHealth literacy compared to women. This disparity is often attributed to patriarchal societal structures in certain regions, where males have greater access to educational opportunities, while others found women exhibit higher levels of eHealth literacy, likely due to their caregiving roles within families,49,50which heighten their engagement with health-related information and preventive measures. Some studies argue that gender differences in eHealth literacy are negligible,21highlighting the need for further exploration of this relationship in diverse contexts.

Self-efficacy emerged as a crucial psychological factor influencing eHealth literacy among older adults. Several studies24,51,52included in this review highlighted that individuals with higher self-efficacy were more confident in navigating digital platforms and more proactive in seeking health information online. These individuals were also more likely to translate digital engagement into positive health behaviors, including preventive care and chronic disease management. Moreover, self-efficacy mediated the relationship between social support and eHealth literacy,1indicating that individuals with stronger social networks may develop greater confidence in using technology through encouragement and guided experience. These findings underscore the need for interventions that build digital skills and strengthen users’ belief in their capacity to succeed. On the other hand, external factors, particularly social relationships and support networks, play a critical role in shaping older adults’ digital health engagement. Our review found that family involvement, companionship, and intergenerational support significantly contributed to older adults’ confidence in using eHealth tools.53For example, familial care and encouragement can mitigate psychological barriers, fostering a sense of competence and autonomy among older individuals in engaging with digital health technologies.54Understanding the interplay between these internal and external factors is essential for designing effective interventions aimed at improving eHealth literacy among older adults. A comprehensive approach that integrates both personal attributes and social contexts can inform tailored strategies to address the unique needs and challenges faced by this demographic. By addressing these multifaceted barriers, interventions can more effectively empower older individuals, enhancing their ability to access and utilize digital health resources to improve overall well-being.

eHealth literacy plays a pivotal role in shaping health literacy, particularly through the facilitation provided by Internet technologies. The widespread adoption of the Internet has dramatically simplified access to health information, enabling individuals to explore diverse health resources and educational content. This expanded accessibility not only broadens knowledge but also equips users with the tools to make informed health decisions. Norman and Skinner's eHealth literacy model9underscores the critical role of information assessment skills, highlighting that individuals with high eHealth literacy are more adept at evaluating the credibility and reliability of online health information. This ability reduces the likelihood of being influenced by misleading content and fosters the adoption of evidence-based health practices. Consequently, these individuals can make more rational and scientifically informed decisions regarding their health. Beyond information assessment, enhanced e-health literacy also empowers individuals to leverage digital technologies for self-health management. This proficiency is particularly crucial in managing chronic diseases, where regular monitoring and self-care practices are essential. Studies have demonstrated that the integration of e-health tools into chronic disease management significantly improves health outcomes.55By utilizing these tools, patients can better monitor their conditions, adhere to treatment plans, and engage in preventive measures, ultimately improving their quality of life. Understanding the connection between e-health literacy, health literacy, and chronic disease management underscores the importance of promoting digital health skills. This focus is critical not only for improving individual health outcomes but also for addressing the broader challenges associated with managing chronic conditions in aging populations.

In the initial stages of our review, we identified numerous studies examining eHealth literacy within the framework of specific chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, malignancies, coronary heart disease, and spondylitis. This focus reflects the growing need for digital support in the management of these conditions. These findings underscore the critical need to address eHealth literacy as an integral component of chronic disease management for this demographic. For instance, a study conducted in the United States found a significant correlation between higher cancer fatalism belief scores and reduced utilization of health information technology.56This suggests that psychological factors like fatalism may hinder the adoption of eHealth tools, potentially limiting access to vital health information. Another American study focusing on older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reported that increased disease severity was significantly associated with higher eHealth literacy levels.57This finding indicates that as health challenges become more pronounced, individuals may develop a greater need and motivation to engage with digital health resources. Given the high prevalence of multiple chronic conditions among older populations, understanding the relationship between e-health literacy and the self-management of these diseases is essential. The intricate relationship between disease-specific outcomes and ehealth literacy highlights the need for specialized interventions.10It follows that e-health literacy among older adults is influenced by a dual mechanism: psychological resistance may hinder participation, while perceived health needs promote digital adoption.

Our review also highlights the heterogeneity within the older people's population, reflecting differing aging processes and socio-cultural contexts.58Several studies set the threshold for older adults at 65 years and above,22–25while others focus on those aged 60 and above.1,26–28Additionally, a few studies adopt a broader definition, considering individuals aged 55 years and above.29–31However, it is important to recognize that there are substantial variations in the use of electronic devices for health-related purposes within these age cohorts. The existing literature on e-health literacy often treats older adults as a homogeneous group, overlooking the significant heterogeneity within this population. A study by Győrffy et al. demonstrated significant behavioral differences within the group, with 65- to 75-year-olds showing higher rates of eHealth use than those over 75.32The study further projected that in the next decade, as younger cohorts age, their prior exposure to technology may reduce the generational gap in eHealth literacy. Future research and interventions should therefore avoid treating older people as a homogenous group and instead adopt an age-stratified or experience-based approach to digital health support. By applying the DigComp framework, we identified some imbalances in focus—review articles focused more on information and data literacy and problem-solving at the expense of digital collaboration, security, and content creation. However, problem-solving in the context of digital health remains a challenge for older people. The pressures of technological uncertainty and perceived security risks often hinder their ability to confidently use digital platforms, leading to lower e-health literacy,20,21but few studies provide effective strategies to address these challenges. The lack of targeted interventions to build digital confidence and reduce perceived risk highlights a key gap in current research and practice. Integrating digital safety education and emotional support into eHealth literacy programs is essential to building a more inclusive and empowering digital health environment for older adults.

This review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the exclusion of non-English publications may have resulted in the omission of relevant research published in other languages, potentially introducing a cultural bias. Secondly, while the inclusion criteria aimed to capture a broad range of studies, the use of wide search parameters may have inadvertently overlooked research focusing on more specific and nuanced aspects of e-health literacy. Furthermore, although the review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, it is important to note that the protocol was not formally registered, which could impact the transparency and reproducibility of the review process. Finally, during the initial stages of screening, when titles and abstracts were reviewed, some articles that focused on disease-specific factors affecting e-health literacy, such as those on coronary heart disease or myelitis, were excluded. A more targeted focus on studies addressing how e-health literacy varies with specific physical conditions in older adults could have provided more comprehensive insights into the factors influencing e-health literacy in this population.

Over the past decade, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global focus on the utilization of electronic health information has intensified, leading to a rise in the number of older adults engaging with e-health tools. During the literature review process, it was noted that most studies continue to employ quantitative methods, primarily using specific questionnaires to assess the level of eHealth literacy among older populations. Despite global variations in demographic characteristics due to differences in economic development and national conditions, the overall e-health literacy among older adults remains relatively low. E-health literacy plays a pivotal role in influencing health behaviors among older individuals. Higher levels of e-health literacy are associated with more proactive and informed health decisions. Moreover, improved e-health literacy contributes to the enhancement of overall health literacy in older adults, which is increasingly important in today's digital healthcare environment. As access to accurate and timely health information becomes more dependent on digital platforms, empowering older adults with the skills to effectively use these resources can help bridge the gap between health information access and health outcomes. Ultimately, fostering higher levels of e-health literacy will contribute to a more health-literate and engaged older population, supporting their well-being in an increasingly digital world.
