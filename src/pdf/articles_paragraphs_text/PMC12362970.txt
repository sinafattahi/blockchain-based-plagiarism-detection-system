To assess the impact of broad-internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling on retinal sensitivity (RS) and metamorphopsia assessed using M-CHARTS in patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM).

The study analyzed 20 eyes treated with broad-ILM peeling within the vascular arcades area for ERM, over a 6-month follow-up. Outcomes measured included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), vertical M-CHARTS scores(MV) and horizontal M-CHARTS scores (MV), central macular thickness (CMT), and RS. RS was evaluated using Microperimeter-MP3 at specified central degrees, and points below 10 dB were considered microscotomas (MS).

Postoperative BCVA improved significantly at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months(allp< 0.01).No significant changes in CMT were noted.MH score improvements were significant at 6 months (P= 0.03), whereas MV scores remained unchanged (P> 0.05).RS notably improved within the central 4° at 3 months (P= 0.04) and 6 months (P= 0.05), but remained unchanged in the central 10° and 20° regions (P> 0.05).

MS did not increase significantly at 1 month postoperatively and remained stable through 3 and 6 months (allP> 0.05).

Broad ILM peeling suggests potential for improving visual acuity and metamorphopsia in ERM patients without causing long-term detrimental effects on retinal sensitivity or increasing the occurrence of MS.

This study evaluated the effects of broad-ILM peeling on 20 eyes with idiopathic epiretinal membrane over a 6-month follow-up. Visual acuity and retinal sensitivity within the central 4° significantly improved postoperatively, in addition, horizontal metamorphopsia scores assessed by M-CHARTS showed significant improvement over time. Broad-ILM peeling showed potential for enhancing visual outcomes without long-term adverse effects.

The internal limiting membrane (ILM) is a thin basement membrane on the retinal surface to which Müller cells attach. While it plays a key role in retinal development, its function in adults remains unclear. ILM peeling is often performed in macular surgeries to relieve traction and improve outcomes, but its extent and necessity in epiretinal membrane (ERM) surgery are still debated.

There are many positive comments about ILM peeling. Previously, it has been reported that only ERM peeling without ILM peeling leaded to approximately 50% of ERM tissues remaining on the central fovea, while it was present in only 2.5% of patients who underwent additional ILM peeling [1]. Park et al. reported that based on the optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed 6-month recurrence rates of 20% without ILM peeling versus only 3% with ILM peeling [2]. Although some previous studies demonstrated that ILM peeling improves retinal sensitivity and does not affect postoperative visual acuity and central fovea thickness in ERM patients, these studies used Microperimeter-MP1 (MP-1) [3] and usefulness of the Microperimeter-MP3 (MP-3; NIDEK), a recent developed instrument, was not fully evaluated.

In contrast, Tranos et al. reported that no recurrence was observed in both ILM peeling group and non-ILM peeling group after 12 months in a randomized control study, including over 100 patients [4]. Thus, the effect of ILM peeling is still controversial in ERM surgery. Moreover, Ripandelli et al. reported that, although no difference was seen in postoperative visual acuity, recovery of mean retinal sensitivity occurred earlier and was better in the non-ILM peeling group than in the peeling group [5]. It has also been reported that the area of microscotoma (MS) appearance clearly matched the area of retinal peeling initiation [6]suggesting that ILM peeling may have no effect on recurrence rates and retinal sensitivity and MS appearance may lead to negative effect.

Our institution performs ILM peeling for ERM extending into the arcade vasculature area to prevent postoperative recurrence. Previous studies have generally limited ILM peeling to the parafoveal area, and to our knowledge, no prior studies have specifically examined retinal sensitivity or the occurrence of MS following broad ILM peeling. Qi et al. compared retinal sensitivity before and after internal limiting membrane peeling using Microperimeter-MP3 at 45 test points within the central 8° visual field, with measurements taken preoperatively and at 1 and 4 months postoperatively [7]. However, their study focused on localized ILM peeling around macular holes, and did not evaluate broad ILM peeling involving wider retinal areas.

In recent years, the MP-3 has made it possible to evaluate macular function more precisely and accurately [8]. The MP-3 measures retinal sensitivity while monitoring fundus images with infrared light, and displays the measurement results by combining the images taken by the built-in fundus camera. This makes it possible to measure local retinal sensitivity more accurately than with Humphrey Field Analyzer. The MP-3 can accurately measure the retina’s sensitivity over wide range.

In this study, we investigated the effect on retinal sensitivity, the occurrence of MS in combined with broad-ILM peeling for ERM using the MP-3.

This retrospective observational study examined 20 eyes in 20 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for idiopathic ERM at St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan, from July 2020 to January 2021. For patients who underwent bilateral surgery, the right eye was selected for analysis. The study included patients with idiopathic ERM classified as Stage 1 or 2 according to Govetto’s classification [9]. Data were obtained by tracking patient charts.

Patients were excluded if they had any intraoperative or postoperative complications, secondary ERM, a history of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, prior intravitreal therapy, corneal opacities, glaucoma, other optic neuropathies, diabetic retinopathy, retinal arterial or venous occlusions, or macular disorders other than ERM.

All surgeries were performed by a single experienced vitreoretinal surgeon. All patients underwent standard 27-gauge PPV using the Alcon Constellation Vision System (Fort Worth, TX, USA), under local sub-Tenon’s anesthesia. In patients with cataracts, phacoemulsification and aspiration were simultaneously performed, followed by implantation of a foldable acrylic intraocular lens into the capsular bag. Triamcinolone acetonide (Kenacort; Wakamoto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was injected intravitreally to visualize the vitreous gel and adhesions. The internal limiting membrane (ILM) was stained with brilliant blue G (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and peeled in all cases.

Ishikawa et al. reported that ILM peeling was ideally restricted to approximately 2-disc diameters (DD) from the fovea to minimize damage to Müller cells and preserve the central retinal architecture [10]. In contrast, our study performed ILM peeling within the vascular arcades in all patients.

Preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, all patients underwent ophthalmological examinations including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), axial length, and central macular thickness (CMT). BCVA was recorded in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) using a standard Landolt C chart. Biomicroscopy was performed using a slit-lamp.

The patient’s retinal sensitivity (RS) was evaluated using MP-3. MP-3 has wider range of stimulus intensity from 0 to 34 dB compared to conventional microperimetry. In addition, auto tracking of the fundus allows for constant tracking of the patient’s fixation. By constantly ensuring that the stimulus point is always in the same position on the retinal surface, extremely accurate sensitivity measurements can be made even in large areas of the retina. A customized pattern with 4 spots in central 4°, 12 spots in central 10°, and 16 spots in central 20° was used in this study to measure inside the arcade vessel (Fig.1). Four regions, nasal, superior, temporal and inferior were divided and shown in Fig.2. In this study, we defined the measurement points below 10 dB as MS [11].

The M-CHARTS (Inami & Co., ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were used to quantify the degree of metamorphopsia.

Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 18 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). For comparisons of preoperative and postoperative (at 1, 3, and 6 months) values of logMAR BCVA, CMT, M-CHARTS scores (vertical and horizontal), RS scores (4°, 10°, and 20°), and MS points (total, nasal, upper, temporal, and lower), the Friedman test was initially performed. When a significant difference was found, post hoc analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction. Post-hoc analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction, even if the Friedman test did not show significant differences for the clinically superiority endpoints. Ap-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 20 eyes from 20 patients were included in the analysis. However, to avoid statistical bias due to correlation between bilateral eyes, only one eye per patient was randomly selected for statistical analysis. The baseline characteristics were summarized in Table1. The mean age of patients was 68.1 ± 10.2 years. There were 12 eyes from male patients and 8 from female patients. Combined cataract surgery was performed in 14 eyes. The mean preoperative logMAR BCVA was 0.19 ± 0.23, mean axial length was 25.0 ± 1.8 mm, and CMT was 398 ± 66 μm.

Table2summarized the postoperative course. Postoperative logMAR BCVA improved significantly at all time points: 1 month (0.003 ± 0.10), 3 months (−0.001 ± 0.09), and 6 months (−0.02 ± 0.09) compared to preoperative values (0.19 ± 0.22), withP< 0.01 (paired t-test). CMT remained stable postoperatively: 1 month (394.2 ± 48.7 μm,P= 0.93), 3 months (387.9 ± 48.6 μm,P= 0.69), and 6 months (371.5 ± 62.8 μm,P= 0.28), showing no statistically significant changes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The mean preoperative vertical M-CHARTS (MV) score decreased from 0.48 ± 0.51 (range, 0–2.0) to 0.37 ± 0.33 at 1 month, 0.40 ± 0.38 at 3 months, and 0.36 ± 0.42 at 6 months postoperatively. However, no significant difference was observed (p> 0.05). The mean preoperative horizontal M-CHARTS (MH) score decreased from 0.37 ± 0.43 to 0.27 ± 0.28 at 1 month, 0.19 ± 0.23 at 3 months, and 0.13 ± 0.18 at 6 months postoperatively, with significant differences at 6 months (p= 0.03).

Mean RS within the central 4° significantly improved from 23.3 ± 0.6 dB preoperatively to 25.1 ± 0.6 dB at 3 months (P= 0.04), and 25.7 ± 0.5 dB at 6 months (P= 0.05). No significant differences were found between 1-, 3-, and 6-month measurements. Mean RS in the central 10° and 20° areas did not show significant changes compared to baseline at any postoperative time point (Table3).

MS showed no significant increase postoperatively and remained stable over time. No significant regional differences were observed in the nasal, superior, temporal, or inferior sectors throughout follow-up (Table4).

ERM is a fibrocellular proliferation on the retinal surface that leads to distortion and visual impairment. While surgical removal is standard, the role and extent of ILM peeling remain controversial. This study investigated functional changes following broad ILM peeling, particularly in relation to RS and metamorphopsia, using MP-3 and M-CHARTS.

BCVA showed a significant improvement in postoperative results. This result was similar to that reported previously [3,4]and this improvement might be due to the removal of ERM and simultaneous cataract surgery. In addition, no postoperative CMT thinning or ERM recurrence occurred. Although ILM is a normal retina, the use of ILM peeling during ERM surgery has been shown to significantly reduce postoperative ERM recurrence while not affecting the retinal structure [11]. In a report by Kanzaki et al., evaluation of ERM on enface imaging showed that ILM peeling beyond the site of ERM formation resulted in no postoperative ERM recurrence and good improvement in visual function [12]. Although this study did not examine ERM recurrence on enface images, no cases of ERM recurrence in the macular area were observed on B-scan imaging.

In this study, MH scores improved significantly by 6 months, while MV remained unchanged. Ichikawa et al. demonstrated that metamorphopsia, particularly along the horizontal axis, gradually improved over time after ERM surgery. Their findings also suggest that horizontal distortion is often more symptomatic and more sensitive to ERM-induced tangential traction [13]. The differential recovery may be due to anatomical differences in photoreceptor alignment and retinal traction vectors along the horizontal versus vertical axes. The observed improvement in horizontal metamorphopsia may also reflect the effect of broad ILM peeling, which potentially relieves tangential traction more effectively across a wider retinal area.

Retinal sensitivity in the central 4° area improved significantly postoperatively. The improvement in mean RS after surgery is likely attributable to both ERM removal and simultaneous cataract surgery. A previous study using the MP-1 in 30 eyes with age-related cataract and idiopathic ERM reported that retinal sensitivity significantly improved after combined cataract surgery and vitrectomy with ILM peeling [14]. In addition, ERM-induced traction can displace the central fovea, disrupt photoreceptor alignment, and lead to chronic deformation or even detachment of photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium [9]especially when Müller cell traction exceeds adhesive forces. The use of MP-3 provided point-to-point tracking accuracy, which enhanced reproducibility compared to earlier systems such as MP-1 or HFA10-2. MP-3’s upper limit of 34 dB might limit detection in high-functioning retina (ceiling effect), yet its infrared tracking and fixation monitoring compensate for this in clinical evaluation of subtle postoperative change [15].

In this study, there was no significant occurrence of MS in the postoperative course. MS, defined as retinal sensitivity points below 10 dB in this study. The threshold of 10 dB has been adopted in prior studies to define localized functional deficits [6,16]supporting its clinical validity. Many reports have suggested that the increase in MS associated with surgery is due to mechanical injury caused by forceps [5,6,17]. In addition, Tadayoni et al. suggested that Dissociated Optic Nerve Fiber Layer appearance (DONFL) formation may be caused by damage to Müller cells from ILM peeling, rather than mechanical injury caused by forceps alone [16]. Preoperative factors that increase MS after surgery include Ectopic Inner Foveal Layers (EIFLs) and glaucoma. Terashima et al. found that if the ERM had preoperatively disrupted the inner layer structure, there was a high risk of lowered visual sensitivity after vitrectomy with ILM peeling [18]. ILM peeling in glaucoma may result in worsened visual field sensitivity, particularly in the nasal hemifield [19,20]. Broad ILM stripping did not increase MS, and RS remained stable throughout the follow-up period. This may be due to the exclusion of patients with glaucoma or EIFL. In a study supporting this result, Osada et al. evaluated as many as 64 measurement points (interpoint distance 2°) for microperimetry in the macula and reported that RS significantly improved after surgery for ERM with ILM peeling [21]. These findings suggest that when patient selection and surgical technique are carefully considered, broad ILM peeling is unlikely to result in long-term retinal dysfunction.

In this study, ILM peeling was performed broadly, and sensitivity was measured broadly. The results suggest that broad-ILM peeling may have a positive effect in normal eyes. The greatest challenge for the surgeon is to improve metamorphopsia in ERM patients while not adversely affecting retinal function. In the future, it will be necessary to increase the number of studies on preoperative retinal morphology, such as ectopic inner foveal layer, and the number of cases, and to further investigate the efficacy of broad-ILM peeling.

This study does not have a control group, so it does not examine the significance of broad ILM peeling. The sample size was relatively small, and the follow-up duration was limited to 6 months. Only one experienced surgeon performed all procedures, which may limit generalizability. Additionally, although BCVA was reported in logMAR, inclusion of Snellen equivalents in supplementary data may facilitate broader understanding. Future studies should include a larger cohort, longer follow-up, and multi-surgeon data to validate the safety and efficacy of broad ILM peeling.

Broad-ILM peeling for ERM did not cause a loss of retinal sensitivity within the central 20° of the retina, and it might reduce ERM relapses. MH score improvements were significant at 6 months, whereas MV scores remained unchanged. Moreover, MS did not increase postoperatively.
