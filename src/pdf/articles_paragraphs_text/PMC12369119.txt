While laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is an established bariatric procedure for obesity, postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains a significant complication. This study evaluates the short-term efficacy of a novel technique combining LSG with acute angle of His reconstruction (LSG-His) versus conventional LSG.

This is a single center retrospective observation cohort study. Among 83 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 39 receiving conventional LSG and 44 undergoing LSG-His (with diaphragmatic fundopexy using 2-0 Prolene sutures) were analyzed. GERD symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Diagnostic Questionnaire (RD-Q) and GERD Questionnaire (GERD-Q) at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-month postoperatively. Weight loss outcomes included percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and total weight loss.

Postoperative follow-up showed a sustained reduction in GERD symptoms for the LSG-His group across all time points using both scoring systems (all p<0.001 vs LSG). The results demonstrated that, when assessed using the GERD-Q at the 24-month follow-up, the prevalence of GERD symptoms was 14% (95% CI: 6.3% - 25.7%) among LSG-His patients versus 46% (95% CI: 32.1% - 60.7%) among LSG patients (p<0.001). As evaluated via the RD-Q at the same 24-month follow-up, GERD symptom prevalence was 7% (95% CI: 2.3%- 17.9%) in the LSG-His group compared with 41% (95% CI: 27.3% - 56.3%) in the LSG group (p<0.001).%EWL was higher in the LSG-His group at 3 months (54.7% vs 46.5%, p=0.033), 6 months (73.8% vs 64%, p=0.047), 12 months (82.9% vs 72.2%, p=0.042) and 24 months (84.1% vs 75.4%, p=0.038) follow-up compared to LSG group.

In this retrospective observational study, LSG-His was associated with lower rates of GERD symptoms and higher %EWL compared to standard LSG, but with comparable %TWL in 24 month outcomes. However, these preliminary results are limited to short-term follow-up, and long-term prospective studies with objective reflux assessment are warranted.

Bariatric surgery provides sustained weight loss and effectively treats obesity-related conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [1]. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), an established procedure for morbid obesity, combines technical simplicity with significant efficacy in weight reduction and comorbidity resolution [2,3]. However, numerous studies have raised concerns that LSG may exacerbate pre-existing GERD, induce new-onset GERD and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function [4–8]. These findings align with the AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines, which explicitly caution against LSG in GERD patients due to potential symptom worsening [9].

The pathophysiology of GERD following LSG remains incompletely elucidated. Increased intragastric pressure, impaired gastric motility and disruption of the anti-reflux barrier have been widely recognized as the key factors contributing to the exacerbation of reflux symptoms [10]. Specifically, LSG involves the excision of the gastric fundus, constriction of the gastric sleeve and creation of a hiatal hernia, which disrupts the diaphragmatic-esophageal ligament and alters the angle of His. These anatomical changes can lead to a reduction in gastric capacity and a decrease in the pressure of the lower LES, facilitating the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus and contributing to the development of GERD symptoms [11].

Disruptions to the angle of His, such as those caused by sliding hernias or surgical interventions like cardioplasty or esophagogastrostomy, have been linked to the development of peptic esophagitis at the esophagogastric junction [12,13]. One study found that an increase in the angle of His following distal gastrectomy was associated with gastroesophageal reflux, suggesting that this angle may serve as an important indicator of reflux severity [14]. Additionally, another study proposed reconstructing the angle of His during proximal gastrectomy by suturing the remaining stomach across the diaphragm, demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in alleviating postoperative GERD symptoms in gastric cancer patients [15].

Although fundoplication and hiatal hernia repair represent established anti-reflux interventions, their technical complexity and potential complications limit application in bariatric surgery. In contrast, reconstruction of the angle of His preserves the native gastroesophageal anatomy while restoring the physiological anti-reflux barrier, offering a technically simpler approach. The anti-reflux efficacy of His angle reconstruction in weight-loss procedures remains insufficiently investigated.

Therefore, we hypothesize that reconstructing the angle of His after LSG might reduce the prevalence of postoperative GERD. Based on this rationale, our center developed a novel procedure combining laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with reconstruction of the acute angle of His (LSG-His). In this procedure, the gastric fundus is suspended over the diaphragm to reconstruct the angle of His during LSG, aiming to preserve or restore the anti-reflux barrier. The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of the LSG-His procedure in managing GERD in patients with obesity.

This study adopted a retrospective observation cohort study design and followed guidelines established by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist [16].

Patients with obesity who met the national Institutes of Health criteria [17] and underwent bariatric surgery were consecutively recruited, form January 2022 to July 2022 at Beijing Chao Yang Hospital, China, Capital Medical University. All patients were subjected to pre-operative endoscopy, and those with severe GERD symptoms, esophagitis (Los Angeles grade C and D), hiatus hernia of any size, stricture or Barrett’s changes were excluded from the study; patients with hiatal hernia detected intraoperatively were also excluded. Patients with missing follow-up data were excluded (Fig.1).

The LSG-His procedures were performed by the same team throughout the study. All investigations were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (approval no. 2023-ke-438). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

The most influential parameter of sample size calculation was the prevalence of postoperative GERD. Based on previous clinical experience at our center, the prevalence of postoperative GERD was 40% after LSG [5,6] and approximately 20% after LSG-His. With 95% confidence and 80% power, the calculated sample size was more than 79. Considering a 15% loss to follow-up rate, the final sample size was more than 90.

For the LSG group, patients were positioned supine and administered general anesthesia. A pneumoperitoneum was established via a 10 mm trocar at the umbilicus. Following laparoscopic exploration, 12 mm and 5 mm trocars were placed in the right upper abdomen and under the right costal margin. A Kirschner wire was inserted under the sella to retract the liver. Following the dissection of short gastric vessels and greater curvature ligaments (gastrosplenic and gastrocolic), the stomach was transected adjacent to a 38 F bougie using a purple Endo GIA™ Tri-staple 60-mm stapler (Medtronic, Shanghai). Transection was performed from the antrum, approximately 4 cm from the pylorus, extending to 1 cm lateral to the esophagus following omental mobilization. The staple line was reinforced with continuously 3–0 V-loc sutures (Medtronic). The resected stomach was extracted via the right upper abdominal port. After confirming hemostasis, trocar sites were closed.

The LSG-His group underwent a procedure identical to the LSG group. His angle reconstruction was systematically performed to restore the acute esophagogastric junction angle, which involved suturing the gastric fundus posterolaterally to the left diaphragmatic crus using 2 − 0 non-absorbable polypropylene (Prolene™) sutures (Ethicon, Shanghai), aiming to augment the anti-reflux barrier. This reconstruction involved interrupted suturing using one stitch from the left side of the fundus to the left diaphragmatic crura, one stitch from the posterior wall of the fundus to the left diaphragmatic crura and one stitch of the right side of the fundus to the esophagus. Intraoperative photographs and an illustration of the surgical technique appear in Fig.2.

All patients received prophylactic omeprazole (20 mg daily) for three months postoperatively. Subsequent on-demand Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use was primarily initiated in response to patient-reported symptoms of heartburn or regurgitation. Most patients used omeprazole at a 20 mg dose, whereas others received equivalent doses of alternative PPIs (pantoprazole or esomeprazole). Treatment duration was self-determined by patients until symptom resolution, with no standardized discontinuation criteria. Owing to the retrospective design of this study, precise thresholds for symptom frequency and data on medication adherence were not systematically documented. For cases refractory to pharmacotherapy, conversion surgery—most commonly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass —was performed as the standard intervention.

Follow-up data were collected retrospectively at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-discharge. Demographic characteristics such as sex, age, and BMI were recorded, along with complications.

Weight loss outcomes were evaluated using both the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL). %TWL = [(Preoperative Weight - Postoperative Weight)/Preoperative Weight] × 100; %EWL = [(Preoperative Weight - Postoperative Weight)/(Preoperative Weight - Ideal Body Weight)] × 100. The ideal weight loss was defined as the weight corresponding to a BMI of 24 kg/m². %TWL is reported as the primary weight loss metric per IFSO 2025 recommendations. Additional data on operative time, intraoperative bleeding, hospital stay and postoperative pain scores at 24 h were retrieved for analysis.

The PPI usage was obtained by retrospectively reviewing patients’ electronic medical records systems and conducting telephone follow-ups. PPI use was operationally defined as any documented intake of PPI medications over the preceding 4-week period prior to the 24-month follow-up timepoint.

Complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system: Grade I (deviation from normal course without intervention), Grade II (pharmacological treatment), Grade III (endoscopic/surgical intervention), Grade IV (life-threatening organ dysfunction), and Grade V (death).

All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables are expressed as medians (interquartile range) or means (standard deviation), with categorical variables reported as frequencies (percentages). Categorical variables were compared using χ² or Fisher’s exact tests, and continuous variables were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent risk factors of postoperative outcomes, incorporating variables with clinical relevance or univariate associations (p< 0.2); results are presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Missing data were handled through complete-case analysis. All 83 patients provided complete 24-month follow-up data for the GERD-Q outcome. Statistical significance was defined asp< 0.05 (two-tailed).

Between January and July 2022, 93 patients undergoing bariatric surgery were initially enrolled, of whom 10 were lost to follow-up, leaving 83 patients included in the final analysis (Fig.1). Notably, no significant differences were observed in key baseline characteristics—including age, sex, preoperative BMI, and the proportion with preoperative GERD symptoms—between the 10 patients lost to follow-up and the 83 patients in the final analysis (Supplementary Table S1).

The final cohort consisted of 44 patients who underwent LSG-His and 39 who underwent LSG; their baseline characteristics are presented in Table1. Baseline demographic data remained comparable between the LSG-His and LSG groups.

The median operative time for LSG-His was longer than for conventional LSG (92.5 [80–110] vs. 80 [70–100] min,p= 0.026), accompanied by higher pain scores in the early postoperative period (mean VAS: 5.2 ± 1.8 vs. 4.3 ± 1.9,p= 0.041) and greater 24-hour opioid consumption (70% vs. 46%,p= 0.025). Safety outcomes did not differ between the groups, with similar intraoperative blood loss (17.7 ± 11.5 vs. 19.9 ± 9.6 mL,p= 0.294), and overall complication rates (10% vs. 7%,p= 0.812). Additionally, no differences were observed for nausea/vomiting, dysphagia, costs, or length of stay (allp> 0.05) (Table1). No patients developed complications such as anastomotic stricture, marginal ulceration, or reflux requiring intervention. No mortality occurred. Postoperative hospitalization duration did not differ significantly between LSG-His and control groups in either morphine users or non-users.(Supplementary Table S2).

Preoperative reflux prevalence (GERD-Q ≥ 8 or RD-Q ≥ 12) did not differ significantly between groups (p> 0.05). Postoperative follow-up showed a sustained reduction in GERD symptoms for the LSG-His group vs. LSG group across all time points using both scoring systems (allp< 0.001). The results showed that, at the 3-month follow-up assessed by GERD-Q, the proportion of LSG-His patients reporting GERD symptoms was 14% (95% CI: 6.3%−25.7%), which was lower than that of the LSG group (46%, 95% CI: 32.1%−60.7%;p< 0.001). Similarly, at the 24-month follow-up evaluated by RD-Q, the proportion of LSG-His patients with reported GERD symptoms was 7% (95% CI: 2.3%−17.9%), lower than that of the LSG group (41%, 95% CI: 27.3%−56.3%;p< 0.001) (Table2, Fig.3). LSG-His group showed lower symptom exacerbation rate (LSG-His:2/14 vs. conventional LSG:5/8;p= 0.041) and higher symptom remission rate (LSG-His:8/14 vs. conventional LSG:2/8;p= 0.033).

To eliminate the potential confounding effect of postoperative PPI use, we assessed postoperative PPI utilization among patients. Notably, PPI utilization rates did not differ significantly between groups across all postoperative time points (allP> 0.05; Supplementary Table S3). Among non-PPI users (84.3%), LSG-His shown lower reflux risk (OR = 4.67,P= 0.011). Although statistical significance was not achieved in PPI users, a clinically relevant reduction in reflux incidence was noted with LSG-His (Supplementary Table S4).

Additionally, exploratory endoscopic evaluation was performed in a subgroup of 34 patients. Results showed that patients receiving LSG-His treatment had a lower prevalence of erosive esophagitis (5/15 vs. 10/19;P= 0.469). Although this trend did not achieve statistical significance, it aligned with the direction of symptom improvement (Supplementary Table S5).

Univariate logistic regression identified surgical approach as the sole significant predictor for GERD outcomes. LSG-His demonstrated profound protective effects against GERD-Q ≥ 8 or RD-Q ≥ 12 (OR = 0.16, 95%CI: 0.06–0.45,P< 0.001). In multivariate models adjusting for uric acid (the only covariate withP< 0.1 in univariate screening), LSG-His remained independently associated with lower risk of GERD-Q ≥ 8 or RD-Q ≥ 12 (OR = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.06–0.45,P< 0.001). No demographic or metabolic variables showed significant associations in either analysis (allP> 0.05). The final multivariate model showed clinically plausible explanatory power (Nagelkerke R²=0.226) with only one significant predictor retained. Key estimates remained biologically consistent (group OR = 0.17, 95%CI 0.06–0.46), and non-significant variables were excluded during modeling. (Table3).

The LSG-His group achieved greater %EWL throughout the 24-month follow-up period compared to LSG (24 months: 84.1% (69.2–81.6) vs. 75.4% (76.3–91.9),p= 0.038), while %TWL was comparable between groups (allp> 0.05) (Table4, Fig.4).

LSG is considered a refluxogenic procedure and the presence of GERD has been considered a relative contraindication for LSG [4–7]. No recent studies have examined whether acute angle of His reconstruction during LSG alleviates postoperative GERD symptoms. Concurrently, recent studies have explored adjunctive anti-reflux strategies, such as combining LSG with Nissen fundoplication (NF). For instance, a meta-analysis of 538 patients demonstrated that the LSG + NF group achieved higher GERD remission rates at the cost of reduced weight loss efficacy and increased postoperative complications compared to standalone sleeve gastrectomy [22]. This underscores the need to evaluate angle of His reconstruction as a potentially simpler and safer alternative for reflux mitigation. In this comparative analysis of short-term outcomes, LSG-His might associated with less GERD symptom and greater %EWL than standard LSG but compa during the 24 month observation period. These preliminary findings support further investigation of LSG-His in randomized trials to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety profile.

The surgical results and post-procedure outcomes suggest that LSG-His might be a relatively safe procedure. There were no significant differences in hospital stay, hospital charges, intraoperative bleeding, or postoperative complications between the two groups, indicating that LSG-His was not associated with an increase either healthcare resource burden or risk of poor postoperative outcomes. While LSG-His was found longer operative time compared to standard LSG, this may be explained by the additional complexity of suturing the fundus to the diaphragm. Moreover, the LSG-His group reported higher postoperative pain scores and a higher rate of morphine use, but a comparable hospital stay and discharge time, indicated that LSG-His was not associated with worsen early recovery. At 24-month follow-up, most LSG-His patients remained free of chronic epigastric pain, suggesting that postoperative pain might be temporary. Nausea, vomiting and dysphagia prevalence in the LSG-His group did not differ significantly from the LSG group. In contrast to anti-reflux interventions like Nissen or modified Rossiti fundoplications, which frequently cause choking and dysphagia due to anatomical alterations [23], our preliminary findings suggest that LSG-His was not associated with a increase in eating difficulties compared to standard LSG. These findings support the exploration of LSG-His as a potentially anatomic modification within the spectrum of surgical anti-reflux strategies for patients with obesity. Nevertheless, this conclusion requires verification in larger, longitudinal studies.

The disruption of the angle of His subsequent to LSG consequently giving rise to gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis has been reported in the literature [24]. Recent studies have reported that the 7%−41% prevalence and 23%−31% worsening of GERD post-LSG [25,26]. In our cohort analysis, postoperative GERD rates following LSG-His were observed at 7% (RDQ) or 14% (GERD-Q). Among patients with preoperative reflux symptoms, the LSG-His group experienced higher symptom remission and lower exacerbation rates compared to the LSG group. However, considering the sample size, the reliability of subgroup analyses remains limited. These preliminary findings suggest LSG-His might be associated with lower postoperative GERD prevalence and potentially less frequent exacerbation of preexisting GERD symptoms.

The LSG-His technique aims to restore the acute angle of His, thereby potentially strengthening the gastroesophageal valve and anti-reflux barrier [28]. Beyond restoring gastroesophageal valve function, LSG-His may also result in reduced gastric volume and decreased gastric acid secretion. These anatomical and physiological modifications may collectively contribute to improved postoperative control of GERD. Moreover, the LSG-His group was associated with higher %EWL in this study. Greater weight loss may contribute to improved GERD symptom control. These findings necessitate cautious interpretation due to the inherent limitations of our observational study design. Despite comparable baseline characteristics between groups, residual confounding may persist due to unmeasured variables, such as subtle anatomical variations, individual differences in symptom perception, or potential selection bias favoring LSG-His in reflux-prone patients. Furthermore, owing to healthcare system constraints and a commitment to minimizing invasive procedures, postoperative endoscopic evaluation and objective reflux testing were not routinely conducted. Consequently, subjective symptom reporting may have influenced our findings, underscoring the need for future studies with objective reflux measures to validate these results.

Although the LSG group exhibited a higher postoperative anti-reflux medication rate than the LSG-His group, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the observed trend toward lower medication usage with LSG-His aligns with the potential advantage of His-angle reconstruction in managing reflux symptoms. The widespread prophylactic or empirical use of PPI after bariatric surgery [27] may mask the true GERD burden; symptoms could be underreported in untreated patients, while some medicated patients receive PPIs preventively without confirmed symptoms. Subgroup analysis revealed lower GERD prevalence with LSG-His both among PPI non-users and users, though statistical significance was not reached in PPI user subgroup. This consistent pattern suggests that the potential reflux-reducing benefit of His-angle restoration may be independent of PPI exposure status. Our study may lack sufficient power to detect small but clinically relevant differences in anti-reflux medication rates between groups. Additional limitations, including unrecorded PPI dosing regimens, treatment duration, and variable patient adherence further complicate GERD assessment. Future investigations should employ standardized pharmacovigilance protocols to elucidate the long-term impact of LSG-His on postoperative PPI burden.

LSG-His group was associated with higher %EWL in this study. Multiple factors may contribute to this. First, the finding that the LSG group had more patients with postoperative-GERD raises the possibility that these patients might undergo dietary changes, favoring higher calorie and carbohydrate liquid foods over higher protein solid foods and experience reduced activity levels due to pain and reflux symptoms, which could contribute to weight regain [5]. The weight reduction outcomes observed in the LSG-His cohort may align with proposed anatomical alterations from His-angle reconstruction. Specifically, diaphragmatic fixation of the gastric fundus could theoretically restrict postoperative fundal expansion, while vagal afferent pathways might contribute to appetite regulation [29]. Additionally, the His-angle reconstruction is hypothesized to improve flap valve competence, potentially prolonging meal duration and enhancing early satiation. These mechanistic hypotheses, suggested by prior preclinical studies, warrant further validation in metabolic surgery populations.

Although LSG-His achieved higher %EWL, no significant difference was observed in %TWL, which is a more reliable metric for absolute weight loss. This indicates comparable weight loss efficacy between the procedures. Subgroup analyses revealed %EWL advantages with LSG-His specifically in patients with baseline BMI < 40 (p= 0.048), whereas no intergroup differences were observed in the BMI ≥ 40 cohort. This indicates that the observed %EWL discrepancy may largely be attributable to methodological weighting differences in calculation, and may not necessarily reflect a substantial difference in absolute weight loss with clinical significance. Furthermore, as substantial weight regain typically occurs 3–5 years postoperatively in most bariatric patients, our two-year follow-up period is insufficient to confirm the long-term weight loss efficacy of LSG-His. Consequently, the long-term weight effects of the His-angle reconstruction need validation through extended follow-up and further large-scale long-term prospective studies.

This study had several inherent limitations. First, the non-randomized observational design restricts causal inference due to potential selection bias in surgical allocation; patient self-selection of procedures may introduce confounding factors. Additionally, reliance on self-reported questionnaires, may fail to detect reflux, thereby underestimating the true burden of GERD. Furthermore, the small sample size may lead to attrition bias and reduce statistical power. The relatively short follow-up duration also precludes definitive conclusions regarding the long-term anti-reflux efficacy and weight maintenance outcomes of LSG-His. Moreover, multivariate analyses should be interpreted with caution due to the risk of overfitting, particularly given the limited number of events per variable. Although ethical approval was obtained, prospective registration of this novel surgical procedure was not feasible given the retrospective nature of the analysis. To address this, the planned future prospective phase of this research has been formally registered. The lack of pre-specified prospective registration may introduce potential biases regarding the selection of reported outcomes. To address these limitations, large-scale, long-term prospective studies incorporating objective reflux assessments are warranted to validate the long-term effects of LSG-His.

In this retrospective observational study, LSG-His was associated with lower rates of GERD symptoms and higher %EWL compared to standard LSG, but with comparable %TWL in 24 month outcomes. However, these preliminary results are limited to short-term follow-up, and long-term prospective studies with objective reflux assessment are warranted.
