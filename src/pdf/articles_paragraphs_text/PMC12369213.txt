Traditional plant-based remedies remain essential to public health, especially in regions where formal healthcare access is limited. This study documents ethnomedicinal practices in Tehsil Hasilpur, Punjab, Pakistan, highlighting how growing and diverse populations utilize local flora for therapeutic purposes.

A total of 421 informants (247 males, 174 females) across 39 villages contributed to the documentation of 39 medicinal plant species from 19 botanical families. Informants represented varied age groups and occupations, including herbalists (25), farmers (18), and Pansars (15). Education levels varied, with 23 illiterate and 18 educated beyond matriculation. Preparation methods included powders (21), juices (15), decoctions (15), and infusions (14), with leaves (35) and whole plants (29) being the most used parts. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices such as Frequency Index, Use Value, and Rank Order Priority were calculated to assess plant significance. Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) was also determined for various ailment categories.

Physalis peruviana exhibited the highest Frequency Index (3.78), whileRorippa sylvestrisshowed notable Use Value (0.57) and Rank Order Priority (32.57) for kidney stones and skin disorders. Informant Consensus Factor values ranged from 0.67 to 1.00, with strong agreement on treatments for ulcers, asthma, and urinary infections. The study also identified novel uses, such asEmex spinosusfor fever and pain relief.

These findings emphasize the cultural and therapeutic relevance of ethnomedicine for growing populations. The preservation and pharmacological validation of such knowledge are vital, especially in areas with limited clinical infrastructure. Integrating scientifically supported traditional remedies into public health strategies could enhance healthcare accessibility while honoring indigenous knowledge systems.

Amidst accelerating urbanization and the globalization of healthcare systems, traditional plant-based remedies remain a cornerstone of public health, particularly in regions where access to modern medical care is limited. For generations, indigenous communities across the world have relied on wild and cultivated medicinal plants to treat a variety of health conditions. This ethnomedicinal knowledgetransmitted orally and through cultural practicesencompasses the identification, preparation, dosage, and spiritual context of plant use [1,2]. Deeply rooted in local ecosystems, such practices reflect a nuanced understanding of the therapeutic properties of flora, developed through centuries of empirical observation and experience.

Notable examples from traditional systems underscore the pharmacological potential of ethnobotanical resources. The Amazonian Cinchona tree, once central to indigenous treatments, led to the discovery of quinine, an effective antimalarial compound [3]. Similarly, the use of Cordyceps fungi in Tibetan medicine illustrates the immunomodulatory capabilities of bioactive compounds derived from natural sources. Ceremonial uses, such as the Amazonian ayahuasca brewmade from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis highlight the intersection of therapeutic and spiritual dimensions in traditional medicine [4]. These examples demonstrate how plant-based remedies serve not only physiological needs but also broader cultural and psychological functions.

However, this rich legacy faces mounting challenges. Rapid urban expansion, habitat destruction, language loss, and diminishing intergenerational knowledge transfer threaten both plant biodiversity and the cultural systems that sustain ethnomedicinal knowledge [5]. Deforestation, mining, and climate change further reduce the availability of key medicinal species. Moreover, the commercialization of traditional remedies often occurs without adequate benefit-sharing or recognition of the communities who safeguard this knowledge, raising ethical and legal concerns.

In recent years, there has been a surge in scientific interest to validate and integrate traditional remedies into modern healthcare. For instance, Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle), traditionally used in folk medicine, has yielded alkaloids now central to cancer treatment [6]. Likewise, ethnomedicinal sources are being explored for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, offering potential solutions to challenges such as antibiotic resistance and chronic diseases. This convergence of traditional wisdom with modern biomedical research opens new avenues for sustainable healthcare innovation.

Beyond direct medicinal uses, many wild plants contribute to nutritional security and resilience in vulnerable populations. The leaves of Moringa oleifera, for example, are rich in essential micronutrients and have been adopted as a food supplement to combat malnutrition in resource-limited settings [7]. Such multipurpose species exemplify the broader role of ethnobotanical knowledge in public health, food security, and ecological sustainability.

Pakistan, with its remarkable floral diversity comprising nearly 6,000 plant species, is a reservoir of ethnomedicinal knowledge. Traditional plant-based remedies remain vital in rural and semi-urban regions, where access to conventional healthcare is often restricted. Plants likeDiospyros lotusandTrillium govanianumare widely utilized for treating ailments ranging from digestive disorders to inflammatory diseases [8,9]. These practices are not merely remnants of the past but continue to play an active role in community health and wellbeing.

This study aims to document and analyze the ethnomedicinal practices in Tehsil Hasilpur, Punjab, Pakistanan area characterized by botanical richness and strong cultural ties to traditional medicine. By cataloging the local use of wild medicinal plants and examining their contemporary relevance, the study contributes to preserving biocultural heritage and informing sustainable healthcare development for a growing population.

The present ethnobotanical study was conducted in Tehsil Hasilpur, District Bahawalpur, Southern Punjab, Pakistan. The region lies between the Satluj River and the Indian border and is located approximately 96 km east of Bahawalpur city, with geographical coordinates of N 294137.926 E 72 3301.617 (Fig.1, Fig.S1).

Hasilpur serves as the administrative headquarters of Hasilpur Tehsil and spans an area of 239,332 hectares. The population comprises approximately 317,513 inhabitants across 115 villages and the main city. Located adjacent to the Cholistan Desert, the area experiences a harsh climate with temperature extremes ranging from 2C to 50C, along with occasional sandstorms. The local economy is predominantly agricultural, supplemented by industries such as cotton ginning, brick kilns, vegetable ghee processing, and wheat milling. The regions culture is rooted in Punjabi traditions, with a strong emphasis on local cuisine prepared from indigenous ingredients [10,11].

Ethnically, the region includes communities from various castes such as Arain, Awan, Jatt, Rajput, and Baloch. Languages commonly spoken include Punjabi dialects such as Majhi, Riasti, and Baagri. Islam is the predominant religion. Cultural practices are deeply rooted in Punjabi traditions, with the Shalwar Kameez being the traditional attire. The area is accessible by a network of roads, such as Chona Wala Road, that facilitate commerce and connectivity. A summary table of the visited villages is provided below in Table1.

The study in Tehsil Hasilpur covered 39 villages, involving multiple field visits to engage with indigenous people and traditional healers (Vaidyas). Data collection employed semi-structured surveys, target interviews, and visual translation using the snowball method. A total of 421 respondents (247 males, 174 females) were randomly selected. Information on ethnomedicinal plants, including local names, uses, treated diseases, and herbal preparation methods, was gathered using a structured questionnaire during target interviews (Fig.S2; Research questionnaire). Plant specimens were collected during surveys, then shade-dried, pressed, and mounted on herbarium sheets for submission to the Botany Department, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. Ethical protocols, including informed consent and confidentiality, were strictly followed. The study protocol received university ethical board approval. Plant names were verified using the International Plant Name Index to ensure accuracy and reliability in ethnomedicinal documentation (Fig.S3).

The study was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of The Islamia University of Bahawalpur (Protocol No. IUB/BOT/2023/49127454120). All interviews were conducted with informed consent, ensuring voluntary participation, confidentiality, and transparency about the study’s purpose and non-commercial intent. Verbal consent was obtained and documented prior to participation. Participants were not compensated and were debriefed following each interview.

The data analysis encompassed the utilization of descriptive statistics, qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis methods. Some ethnobotanical information was examined using a Microsoft Excel sheet and SPSS version 26 [12].

To evaluate the relative significance of families, the FIV was used. It was computed by dividing the number of informants who mentioned the family by the total number of informants [12].

Where “FC” is the number of informers revealing the family, while “N” is the total number of informants who participated in the research.

POPUT is used to calculate the importance of a plant species for medicinal and therapeutic uses. Using the POPUT formula, values for POPUT were determined [12].

Where “NURIT” refers to the number of use reports for each sickness or treatment effect. “TUR” is the total number of use reports.

The Informant Consensus Factor was developed as a result of the search for the informant’s agreement on the stated treatment for each category of disease and determined by the given formula [12].

Where “Nur” explains the total use report for each category, while “Nt” explains the taxonomic numbers used. An estimate of the significance of each plant taxon in conventional knowledge is provided by consensus information-gathering methodology. The informant’s agreement with the species that are used to cure a specific ailment falls under the rank of high ICF.

Plant part value is a measure of the relative importance of different plant parts in traditional medicines. The PPV of a plant species can vary depending on the cultural context and the specific needs of the community. It is computed what proportion of the plant’s components such as its root, seed, leaves, flower, fruit, etc. are used [13].

Whereof uses reported per part of the plant andtotal number of uses reported of all parts of the plant.

The formula below was used to calculate the index of the relative frequency of citations [6].

Where FC is the number of informants who reported using a species and N is the total number of informants.

The plant species and their overall state are not completely determined by their UV. Its value was calculated using the formula shown below [14].

Where “UV” denotes each species’ use value, “Ui” indicates the number of uses recorded by each informant for a specific species, and “N” is the total number of informants.

According to their RI values, each plant species’ use and the body organ systems it treats are rated [14]. It is determined as.

Where “R. Ph” denotes relative pharmacological traits. “R.Ph” is determined by dividing the number of uses (U) by the total number of use reports in the whole study. “R.BS” indicates relative body systems treated. The “R.BS” value is obtained by dividing the number of body systems treated by a plant species by the total number of body systems studied.

To determine the value of the species associated with medicines, the fidelity level was determined [14].

“Np” is the number of species in a particular category. “N” is used to accurately total consumption for specific species.

RPL is the ratio of the total number of informants for all diseases to the number of ailments healed by a specific plant species. Plant species with comparable FL may, however, have different therapeutic capacities. The RPL assumes a value between 0 and 1.0, with 0 denoting no ailments that a plant species treats and 1.0 denoting the entire popularity of a plant for significant ailments. The popularity index would be at its highest point (1.0) when all plant species were regularly employed to treat some serious illnesses; it would then decline toward zero as the relative popularity of the species veered away from the popular side. For species of popular plants, the RPL value is sensibly chosen to be unity (i.e., 1), but for species of unpopular plants, the RPL value is less than 1. It is determined whether a plant species is popular or unpopular based on its relative popularity level (RPL). Each plant’s RPL value can be calculated based on its precise location on a graph [14].

Plant species with different fidelity levels and Relative popularity level values are properly ranked using a correction factor known as ROP. The ROP is made from the FL by multiplying the RPL and ROP values [14].

To summarize the ethnobotanical data, a descriptive statistical method (percentage and/or frequency) was used. The Frequency Index (FI) was calculated using the following formula for the quantitative data analysis of the ethnomedicinal plants [15].

Where “FC” is the number of traditional healers who mentioned the use of species and “N” is the total number of respondents.

The cultural significance index was used to determine how well-aligned informant knowledge was with the use of reports for a particular species. The following formula was used to calculate it [15].

While “i” refers to the management of species that significantly affect the community, “e” indicates the informant’s preference for one plant species over another for a specific purpose (value 2 for preferred species and value 1 for non-preferred species) and the letter “c” denotes the frequency of use of a plant species (a species that is cultivated, managed, or operated in any way receives a score of 2 and a score of 1 if the species is still free of any kind).

Family use value is a measure of the importance of plant species to a particular family. To determine the significance of plant families, the FUV is calculated by using this formula [16].

Where “ns” is the overall number of species within a family and “UVs” is the total usage value of all the species within that family.

A total of 421 individuals were interviewed, comprising 247 males and 174 females. The informants included herbalists (104), farmers (77), Pansars (63), and others (176). Age distribution was as follows: 78 individuals were between 30 and 40 years, 116 between 40 and 50 years, 114 between 50 and 60 years, and 112 were over 60 years of age. Regarding literacy, 23% of respondents were illiterate, 22% had primary education, 13% had middle-level education, 24% had matric-level education, and 18% had education beyond matric. Occupational breakdown showed 25% were herbalists, 15% Pansars, 18% farmers, and 42% from other professions. A total of 19 plant families and 39 medicinal plant species were reported (Table2).

The lower female representation reflects gender imbalances commonly reported in ethnobotanical studies. Factors such as cultural norms, societal roles, and accessibility contribute to this trend, as noted in existing literature. The prominence of herbalists and Pansars among respondents aligns with their active roles in traditional medicinal practices [17]. Notably, the highest volume of ethnomedicinal data originated from the 40–50 age group, whereas the illiterate group contributed the least. These patterns are consistent with previous findings indicating that middle-aged and more educated individuals typically possess and share more ethnobotanical knowledge [18–20].

In total, 39 plant species from 19 families were documented in the study area. Among these, 64% were perennial and 36% were annual (Fig.2a). Growth form analysis showed that herbs accounted for 54% of species, followed by trees (20%), shrubs (13%), and weedy grasses (13%) (Fig.2b).

The dominance of perennial plants mirrors findings from other ethnobotanical studies, which attribute this trend to their consistent availability and reliable medicinal properties. Similarly, the prevalence of herbs is a common feature across ethnobotanical literature, likely due to their accessibility and versatility in traditional medicine. These results are comparable to studies conducted in Haripur [21] and Thana Town, Malakand [6], where similar trends were observed.

Among the documented preparation methods for medicinal plants, powders were the most common (21%), followed by juice and decoction (15%), infusion (14%), herbal tea (12%), paste (11%), and other methods (12%) (Fig.3). Less commonly used methods included raw, liquid, and ash preparations. Regarding plant parts utilized, leaves were the most frequently used (28.88%), followed by seeds (16%).

The most represented plant family in the study was Poaceae (21%), followed by Fabaceae (17%). Other families included Asteraceae (8%), Solanaceae (6%), Chenopodiaceae (6%), Rhamnaceae (6%), Amaranthaceae (6%), and Polygonaceae (6%) (Fig.4). Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae each contributed three species. Asphodelaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Convolvulaceae were represented by two species each. All remaining families had one species each.

The high representation of Poaceae and Fabaceae may be attributed to their ecological abundance, wide geographic distribution, and recognized therapeutic potential. These families are commonly cited in ethnobotanical literature due to their diverse phytochemical profiles and adaptability to various habitats. In contrast, families with lower FIV scores may be underrepresented because of their restricted regional occurrence, specific ecological niches, or limited cultural familiarity. These findings are consistent with previous studies emphasizing how ecological availability and local ethnomedical traditions shape the prominence of plant families in traditional healthcare systems [12,22,23].

In the study area, the POPUT, which quantifies the medicinal relevance of plants for specific health conditions, ranged from 0.112 to 0.009. The most commonly reported ailments were skin disorders and coughs, both with the highest POPUT value of 0.112. These were followed by kidney stones (0.095), arthritis (0.090), digestive disorders (0.086), wound healing (0.076), and fevers (0.067). Asthma and diuretic-related issues each had a POPUT value of 0.064, while constipation (0.059), pain relief (0.047), diabetes (0.038), and urinary diseases (0.036) were also reported. Less frequent conditions included diarrhea and flu (0.0167 each), female disorders and paralysis (0.014 each), earaches (0.011), and ulcers (0.009) (Table3).

The predominance of skin disorders and coughs corresponds with global health patterns, often influenced by environmental factors, poor air quality, infections, and seasonal changes. These high POPUT values suggest that such ailments are not only prevalent in the community but are also considered important enough to warrant consistent treatment using ethnomedicinal knowledge. Conversely, the lower POPUT values for conditions like ulcers, female disorders, and paralysis may reflect limited awareness, cultural stigma, or less frequent occurrence in the population. These patterns are in line with previously documented health trends, which emphasize the influence of environmental and lifestyle factors on disease prevalence and medicinal plant usage [12,14].

In total, 39 plant species from 19 different families were reported to treat various diseases. The ICF, which measures the degree of agreement among informants regarding plant use for specific ailments, ranged from 0.60 to 1.00 (Table3). The highest ICF values (1.00) were recorded for earaches, ulcers, paralysis, flu, hair treatment, and hemorrhages. Liver disorders and urinary diseases followed closely with values of 0.86. Kidney stones had an ICF of 0.84, while asthma, fever, and diuretic-related ailments each had an ICF of 0.81. Anti-inflammatory uses showed a high consensus with an ICF of 0.80. The lowest values were found for diarrhea (0.67) and female disorders (0.60).

Various plant components were used in ethnomedicinal practices reported by informants. Leaves were the most frequently utilized part, accounting for 35% of all reported uses. Whole plants were used in 29% of cases, followed by roots (12%), fruits (7%), seeds (6%), and both stems and flowers (4% each). Bark, tubers, and green wings were less commonly used, each accounting for 3%, 1%, and 1%, respectively (Fig.5). Specifically, leaves appeared in 38% of all documented traditional remedies, followed by stems and roots (10% each), and fruit, seed, and flower (7% each).

The dominant use of leaves aligns with many ethnobotanical studies, where leaves are commonly preferred due to their easy accessibility and high concentrations of bioactive compounds. Leaves can be harvested sustainably without harming the plant, making them both ecologically and practically favorable for continued use. Whole plants and roots, though less sustainable, are often associated with stronger or more holistic therapeutic effects. The infrequent use of plant parts such as bark, tubers, and green wings may be attributed to cultural specificity, lower phytochemical content, or niche applications. These findings mirror trends observed in previous ethnobotanical surveys, where leaf use was reported in 30.2–61.5% of cases, with fruits, stems, and rhizomes as commonly reported alternatives [25–27].

The RFC for plant species in the study ranged from 0.038 to 0.017 (Table4). The species with the highest RFC wasPhysalis peruviana(0.038), followed closely byDigera muricata,Datura metel,Zaleya pentandra, andCynodon dactylon, each with a value of 0.035. Other notable species includedCuscuta reflexa,Aerva javanica, andCalotropis procera, all with RFC values of 0.033. The lowest RFC values, 0.017, were recorded forVerbascum virgatumandRorippa sylvestris.

The scientific names of all recorded plant species were authenticated using the Plants of the World Online (POWO) database, maintained by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (POWO, 2021). Abbreviations: BN (Botanical name), LN (Local name), LF (Life form), PPU (Plant Part used), Rec (Recipe), App (Mode of application), UV (Use value), FL (Fidelity level), RFC (Relative frequency citation), RPL (Relative popularity level), ROP (Rank order priority), FI (Frequency index), CSI (Cultural significance index), RI (Relative importance), This plant is known to have toxic properties and caution should be exercised, *Novel use ()=Plant with similar use, ()=Plant with dissimilar use, ();=Plant not reported in the previous study, 1: Altaf et al. (2019), 2: Wariss et al. (2014), 3: Fatima et al. (2019), 4: Khan et al. (2012), 5: Hussain et al. (2015), 6: Azhar et al. (2022), 7: Uzun and Koca (2020), 8: Haider and Zhong (2014), 9: Ismail et al. (2010), 10: Hu et al. (2020).

These RFC values reflect the degree of familiarity and frequency of use of each species among local informants. Higher RFC values, as seen forPhysalis peruvianaandDatura metel, indicate widespread traditional use and possibly well-established therapeutic roles. Such trends are consistent with other ethnobotanical surveys, such as the high RFC reported forViola canescensin Azad Jammu and Kashmir [27] andRosa indicain District Lahore [17]. The RFC metric is influenced primarily by the number of informants citing each species, highlighting its cultural prominence and perceived efficacy in traditional healing practices [28].

The UV, which reflects the relative importance of each plant based on the number of uses cited by informants, ranged from 0.57 to 0.15 in the current study (Table4). The highest UV was recorded forRorippa sylvestris(0.57), followed byLeptachloa fusca(0.44), andCenchrus biflorus,Gamochaeta pensylvanica, andVerbascum virgatum(0.43 each). These plants were commonly reported for the treatment of ailments such as asthma, liver disorders, and skin diseases. Conversely, the lowest UV values (0.01) were observed forAlhagi maurorum,Eclipta prostrata, andTrianthema portulacastrum.

Higher UV values indicate both broad and repeated use of these species in treating multiple diseases, suggesting strong community reliance and sustained ethnomedicinal knowledge. These findings are consistent with previous studies that associate high UV values with plants recognized for their therapeutic efficacy, broad pharmacological properties, and cultural importance in traditional healthcare systems [3]. UV serves as a composite measure of both versatility and popularity of a species in folk medicine, offering a quantitative view of its significance.

The RI values for the plant species ranged from 4.7 to 11.23 (Table4). The highest RI was found inChenopodium murale(11.23), followed byCynodon dactylon(9.36),Digera muricata(9.35), andCalotropis procera(9.24). Other species also showed considerable RI values, reflecting their roles in treating multiple health disorders.

A higher RI score indicates a plant’s ability to treat a wide range of diseases affecting various body systems, and often correlates with both therapeutic diversity and cultural entrenchment. These findings support ethnobotanical literature that identifies high-RI species as having extensive applications and high local importance due to their effectiveness and the presence of bioactive constituents [17]. The RI thus helps prioritize species for further pharmacological and phytochemical investigation based on their holistic significance in traditional medicine.

FL was used to determine the consistency of use of certain plant species for specific ailments. Among the 39 species studied, the highest FL was observed forEragrostis cilianensis(78%) for treating flu,Spergula arvensis(71%) for kidney stones, andErigeron canadensis(70%) for hemorrhages.Emex spinosusalso showed a high FL (70%) as a painkiller, whileDactyloctenium aegyptium(69%) andVicia hirsuta(67%) were primarily used for fever and inflammation, respectively. The lowest FL value (25%) was recorded forSaccharum bengalense, which was used in treating skin diseases (Table4).

High FL values indicate strong cultural consensus and belief in the efficacy of certain species for treating particular conditions. These results align with prior studies where species such asSolanum americanum(66.14%) andAzadirachta indica(93.4%) were reported with similarly high FL values, reflecting the reliability and targeted use of such species in community healthcare [3,24]. FL thus provides insight into how specific plants are trusted for particular ailments, offering valuable direction for pharmacological validation.

T he RPL of plant species in the study area ranged from 0.57 to 0.15 (Table4). The highest RPL value was recorded forRorippa sylvestris(0.57), followed byLeptachloa fusca(0.44),Cenchrus biflorus,Gamochaeta pensylvanica, andVerbascum virgatum(0.43 each). These species were commonly used for treating constipation, asthma, liver problems, skin conditions, and blood purification.

RPL reflects how widely a plant is recognized and accepted in folk medicine within the community. The higher values observed for the aforementioned species indicate their prominent role in treating common ailments and the population’s familiarity with their applications. These findings resonate with other ethnobotanical reports, such as those from regions whereSolanum surattenseandWithania somniferahad RPL values of 1.0, denoting even higher cultural embedding. While our study recorded comparatively lower RPL values, the consistency of these findings highlights the relative popularity and practical relevance of these species in local healthcare traditions [12]. This emphasizes the continuing importance of indigenous knowledge systems in maintaining effective traditional health practices.

The ROP values were calculated to determine the priority of plant species based on their perceived therapeutic efficacy and ethnomedicinal significance (Table4).Rorippa sylvestrisranked highest (ROP = 32.57) for its application in treating kidney stones, followed byVerbascum virgatumfor asthma, andEmex spinosusfor pain relief. Several other species were identified as important in the treatment of digestive disorders, flu, and skin-related ailments. In contrast,Erigeron canadensishad the lowest ROP value (7.6), indicating a comparatively lower ethnopharmacological importance.

The FI was used to assess how frequently each plant species was cited by informants, serving as an indicator of local usage trends (Table4).Physalis peruvianaexhibited the highest FI at 3.778, followed closely byDigera muricata,Datura metel,Zaleya pentandra, andCynodon dactylon, each with an FI of 3.526. A group of other species, includingCuscuta reflexa,Aerva javanica,Dactyloctenium aegyptium,Chenopodium murale,Calotropis procera, andTribulus terrestris, shared an FI of 3.275. Slightly lower FI values (3.023) were recorded for species such asLaunaea nudicaulis,Cenchrus ciliaris,Vachellia nilotica,Capparis decidua,Albizia lebbeck, andSaccharum bengalensis. The lowest FI values were found inCenchrus biflorus,Spergula arvensis,Gamochaeta pensylvanica,Verbascum virgatum, andRorippa sylvestris, ranging from 1.763 to 1.667.

Higher FI values suggest a greater frequency of use and stronger cultural recognition of these species, underscoring their prominence in local ethnomedicinal knowledge systems. The prominence ofPhysalis peruvianaandDigera muricata, for instance, reflects both their accessibility and perceived efficacy. These findings are consistent with literature from other regions. For example, in South Africa,Elephantorrhiza elephantinahad the highest FI, whileAloe grandidentatarecorded the lowest [31]. In Nepal, FI values for species such asAchyranthes aspera(14.81),Centella asiatica(30.86),Dioscorea bulbifera(74),Mimosa pudica(13.58), andJatropha curcas(7.40) highlighted similar reliance on key plant species [28]. Thus, FI provides a robust quantitative measure for identifying culturally significant and frequently used plants in traditional healthcare.

The CSI evaluates the cultural and medicinal importance of plant species by integrating their use frequency, versatility, and sociocultural value (Table4).Physalis peruvianaexhibited the highest CSI (4.0), reflecting its widespread application in treating kidney stones, liver disorders, and constipation. Other highly ranked species includedDigera muricata(CSI = 3.73), known for treating arthritis, female reproductive issues, and wound healing.Zaleya pentandra,Cynodon dactylon, andCuscuta reflexaalso showed high CSI values, ranging between 3.46 and 3.73. In contrast, species such asGamochaeta pensylvanicaandVerbascum virgatumshowed much lower CSI scores, ranging from 0.467 to 0.6.

These values indicate the extent to which specific plants are integrated into local medicinal and cultural practices. Plants with higher CSI values are often those that serve multiple therapeutic purposes, are used by a broad segment of the community, and have longstanding symbolic or ritual importance. Similar patterns are documented in global ethnobotanical literature. For instance, the CSI ofOryza sativawas 0.81,Poa annuascored 7.69, andZea maysrecorded 6.77 in other cultural contexts, demonstrating that CSI values vary significantly based on regional customs, availability, and socio-economic relevance [32–34]. The CSI thus complements other ethnobotanical indices by providing a multidimensional view of plant value within traditional health systems.

The FUV analysis provides insights into the relative importance of different plant families based on their traditional medicinal use, ecological presence, and cultural and economic contributions. Among the families recorded, Brassicaceae ranked the highest with an FUV of 0.57, reflecting its widespread application in food and health, particularly through species such as cabbage and mustard. Scrophulariaceae followed with a value of 0.43, underlining its recognized medicinal relevance in treating respiratory and inflammatory conditions. Other families, including Leguminaceae, Orbanchaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae, also demonstrated significant use values, indicating their active roles in local health practices (Fig.6).

Interestingly, the Poaceae family displayed variable FUV scores1.26 and 0.3reflecting the diversity of species it encompasses and their multiple roles ranging from nutritional to therapeutic. These findings are consistent with broader ethnobotanical patterns, where plant families such as Brassicaceae are not only culturally significant due to their culinary use but also pharmacologically relevant [34,35]. Similarly, the medicinal importance of Scrophulariaceae has been substantiated in other studies for its applications in traditional therapies. These FUV outcomes affirm the multifunctional role of certain plant families in human well-being, linking biodiversity with both subsistence and healthcare systems.

Total number of species common in both areas, PPSU. Percentage of plants with similar uses, PPDU. Percentage of plants with dissimilar uses, JI. Jaccard index.

Additionally, Layyah, Pakistan, showed the highest number of shared species (17) with Hasilpur [40], highlighting a close floristic and ethnomedical alignment, which may be attributed to similar agro-ecological and socio-cultural conditions. The percentage of species with similar uses ranged from 0% (Iran) to 14% (Shakargadh), while dissimilar uses ranged from 0 to 21.4%, with Shakargadh again recording the highest discrepancy [36]. These variations emphasize the dynamic, location-specific nature of ethnomedicinal knowledge, supporting the need for regionally focused documentation to capture both conserved and evolving practices.

Importantly, while many plants shared across regions are traditionally valued for their healing properties, caution must be exercised in their use. For instance, Calotropis procera and Datura metel, both cited in this and other ethnobotanical surveys, are known to possess toxic compounds.C. proceracontains cardiac glycosides, which can induce nausea, vomiting, and arrhythmias, whileD. metelis rich in tropane alkaloids, known to cause hallucinations, dry mouth, blurred vision, and seizures when improperly used. These pharmacological risks necessitate careful application and underscore the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with modern healthcare guidance.

Tehsil Hasilpur is rich in medicinal plant diversity and ethnobotanical knowledge, particularly valuable in addressing healthcare needs in remote areas. A comparison of the present findings with 20 ethnobotanical studies from Pakistan and neighboring regions revealed 39 plant species with novel or regionally distinctive uses, reflecting unique cultural practices and ecological adaptations.

For instance,Acacia amplicepsis traditionally underreported in ethnomedicine, but in Hasilpur, it is used for treating skin and digestive disorders and diabetes.Vachellia nilotica, though widely known, is used here as a remedy for dysentery, in addition to diabetes and fever.Aerva javanicaandAlbizia lebbeckwere recorded for arthritis and eye diseases, respectivelyapplications seldom cited in earlier studies.Calotropis procerawas noted for asthma and digestive ailments, expanding its commonly known uses.Capparis deciduaandCassia fistulawere found helpful in blood purification and arthritis, uses rarely reported in the literature.

Several grasses likeCenchrus biflorusandC. ciliariswere locally employed for asthma, diuretic action, and kidney stone treatment.Chenopodium muralewas used for ulcers anddiarrhea, whileCistanche deserticolawas reported for arthritis and cough for the first time in this region.Erigeron canadensiswas applied for hemorrhage, andCuscuta reflexafor paralysis and hair treatment.Cynodon dactylonshowed extended use in eye and skin disorders.

Uncommon applications were also recorded forDactyloctenium aegyptium(digestive issues),Datura metel(earache),Digera muricataandEmex spinosa(female disorders), andEragrostis cilianensis(kidney stones).Gamochaeta pensylvanicaandPhysalis peruvianawere both documented for diabetes and kidney stone treatment respectivelynovel contributions to their therapeutic profiles.

Leptochloa fuscaandLaunaea nudicauliswere used forliver disordersandarthritis.Leucaena leucocephalaandMelilotus indicuswere noted for female health and diuretic effects.Panicum antidotalewas valued for blood purification.Persicaria lapathifoliashowed entirely new uses in treating fever and digestive ailments, andPhalaris minorfor dysentery.Prosopis cinerariaextended its applications to asthma, andRorippa sylvestriswas used for urinary diseases and kidney stonesnovel local insights.

Further,Saccharum bengalense,Spergula arvensis,Suaeda nigra,Tribulus terrestris, andZaleya pentandrawere documented for treatingconstipation,diuretic issues,skin, anddigestivedisorders, andkidney stonesmany of which had not been previously reported in Pakistan.Verbascum virgatumandVicia hirsutawere newly identified forasthma,cough,pain relief, andanti-inflammatoryuse. Lastly,Ziziphus jujubaandZ. nummulariaadded novel data on their use inasthma,constipation,diabetes, andinflammation.

These findings demonstrate the uniqueness of ethnomedicinal practices in Hasilpur, expanding the national phytotherapeutic landscape. The novel applications align with broader trends while contributing original insights to Pakistan’s traditional healing repertoire (see Fig.7, Fig. S4), emphasizing the urgent need to document and preserve such localized knowledge before it fades.

While this study highlights the rich ethnomedicinal knowledge of Hasilpur tehsil, it is equally important to consider the potential toxicity of certain plants traditionally used for healing purposes. Several species documented here contain bioactive compounds known to cause adverse effects when consumed inappropriately or without expert supervision.

Calotropis procera(Aak), commonly used for arthritis, asthma, and digestive disorders, contains toxic cardiac glycosides such as calotropin. These compounds may induce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when consumed in large doses or over extended periods.Datura metel, valued in traditional medicine for earache, cough, and wound healing, contains tropane alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. These are potent neurotoxins, and misuse can lead to dry mouth, blurred vision, hallucinations, hyperthermia, seizures, and even death. Extreme caution is required in its handling and internal application.Physalis peruviana, newly reported here for treating kidney stones, has fruits and leaves that may contain solanine-like glycoalkaloids, especially when unripe. These compounds can cause gastrointestinal irritation, including nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.Cuscuta reflexa(Akas bail), a parasitic herb used for hair treatment and paralysis, is reported in literature to contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are hepatotoxic and may pose a risk of cumulative liver damage if consumed over time.

Chenopodium murale, documented for treating digestive disorders and ulcers, contains saponins and oxalates. These can be irritating to the gastrointestinal tract and potentially toxic to livestock and humans in high doses.Cassia fistula(Amaltas), widely used for arthritis, constipation, and fever, possesses anthraquinones in its pods and pulp, which can act as powerful laxatives. Overuse may result in electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, or intestinal cramps.Tribulus terrestris, utilized for cough, kidney stones, and urinary issues, has shown hepatotoxic and hormonal side effects in some experimental animal studies. Excessive intake may affect liver function and androgenic balance.

These plants exemplify the critical need for integrating toxicological awareness with ethnobotanical knowledge. While local communities have employed these species effectively for generations, their bioactive profiles warrant careful usage, standardized dosages, and informed healthcare practices. We recommend awareness campaigns and training for traditional healers to ensure the safe use of these potent medicinal plants. Additionally, scientific validation of dosages and active compounds will help balance therapeutic benefits with potential risks.

The unique uses of plants in Hasilpur, as compared to other regions, reflect the area’s distinct cultural and environmental context. The identification ofVicia hirsutaas an anti-inflammatory and painkiller, for example, may be rooted in the specific ecological zones of Hasilpur, where this plant is more abundant. Additionally, the practice of usingEmex spinosusleaves for treating female disorders suggests that local health practices are tailored to address specific community needs. The cultural significance of certain plants, such asPersicaria lapathifoliaandPhysalis peruviana, may also be influenced by the community’s historical and medicinal traditions, which prioritize the treatment of ailments like digestive disorders and kidney stones.

In comparison to other areas, the use of plants likeRorippa sylvestrisandVerbascum virgatumfor urinary diseases and asthma treatment represents a local variation in how common ailments are managed. This points to the importance of local knowledge in shaping medicinal plant use, based on factors such as plant availability, the ecological context, and cultural beliefs. These regional differences are essential for understanding how traditional healing systems evolve in relation to the environment and community needs, underlining the cultural richness and diversity of the ethnobotanical practices in Tehsil Hasilpur.

The results of this study carry significant implications for both environmental and public health issues in Tehsil Hasilpur. The abundance of medicinal plants and their widespread use in the local population provide an alternative source of healthcare, particularly in areas where modern medical facilities may be limited. However, the continued reliance on wild plant species raises concerns about their sustainability. Over-harvesting, without proper management, could lead to the depletion of these valuable resources. Therefore, sustainable harvesting practices and the promotion of medicinal plant cultivation should be prioritized to ensure the long-term availability of these plants for future generations.

Moreover, the wide use of plants for treating common ailments such as fever, digestive issues, kidney stones, and respiratory disorders emphasizes the pressing need for affordable and accessible healthcare solutions in the region. Integrating these traditional healing practices with modern medical treatments could offer more holistic health care, especially for rural populations. The data underscores the importance of preserving traditional knowledge and exploring the potential of these plants in the development of alternative therapeutic options, especially in resource-limited settings.

The environmental aspect of this study also highlights the need for conservation efforts to protect the biodiversity of the region’s flora. Many of the plants used in local medicine are endemic or found in specific ecological zones, making them particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation. Efforts to conserve these plants should include educating local communities about sustainable harvesting, as well as supporting the establishment of medicinal plant nurseries to cultivate these species [54,55].

The exploration of ethnomedicinal flora in Tehsil Hasilpur provides valuable insights into the traditional knowledge of indigenous communities. The study, involving 421 participants from diverse age groups and genders, highlighted the socio-demographic aspects of informants. A total of 39 plant species from 19 families were identified, with a dominance of perennial plants. Preparation methods such as powder, juice, and decoction were common, aligning with existing literature. Quantitative data analysis, including Family Importance Value, Popular Therapeutic Use Value, and Informant Consensus Factor, revealed key plant families and therapeutic uses. Other indices like Plant Part Value, Relative Frequency Citation, and Fidelity Level offered deeper insights into the effectiveness of various plant components. Family Use Value emphasizes the ecological, economic, and cultural significance of plant families. Comparative analyses using the Jaccard and Novelty indices highlighted both similarities and unique aspects of Tehsil Hasilpur’s ethnomedicinal knowledge. The identification of novel plant uses underscores the richness of local knowledge, contributing to the documentation of ethnomedicinal practices. This study stresses the need to preserve and integrate traditional knowledge into modern healthcare strategies, providing a resource for future research, conservation, and sustainable plant use in the region.
