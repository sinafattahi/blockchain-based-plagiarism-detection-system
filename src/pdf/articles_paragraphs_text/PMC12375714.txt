Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperones that maintain cellular proteostasis under physiological and stress conditions. HSPH1 (Heat Shock Protein Family H Member 1, also known as HSP105 or HSP110) belongs to the HSP110 family and functions as a nucleotide exchange factor for HSP70, enhancing its folding activity. Beyond its canonical role, HSPH1 is increasingly recognized for its involvement in tumor progression. It has been reported to regulate cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy in several cancers, including breast, lung, and liver cancer. Pan-cancer transcriptomic analyses have identified HSPH1 as frequently overexpressed and correlated with poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while other HSPs such as HSP70 and HSP90 are well-studied, the biological role of HSPH1 remains unclear. In this study, we systematically analyzed HSPH1 expression in HCC using TCGA and GEO datasets, and validated its clinical relevance in patient samples. HSPH1 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with advanced tumor stage and worse overall survival. Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses suggested that HSPH1 participates in oncogenic pathways (e.g., p53, cell cycle) and modulates the tumor immune microenvironment. Knockdown of HSPH1 in HCC cell lines inhibited proliferation and colony formation. Together, our findings highlight HSPH1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality1,2. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are major risk factors for HCC, with an estimated 300 million HBV carriers globally – about a quarter of whom may eventually develop HCC3,4. Despite advances in treatment, the overall prognosis of HCC remains poor, largely due to late diagnosis, high rates of recurrence, and therapy resistance. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify new molecular markers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes in HCC.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of highly conserved proteins that function as molecular chaperones, protecting other proteins from damage and assisting in the refolding of misfolded proteins under cellular stress. Heat shock protein H1 (HSPH1, also known as HSP105 or HSP110) is a member of the HSP110 family5,6. It is encoded on human chromosome 13q12. 3 and plays a critical role in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis. Beyond its chaperone function, HSPH1 has been implicated in the proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells7. Notably, many HSP family members including HSPH1 are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes beyond cancer, underscoring their fundamental importance in diverse biological contexts.

In the context of oncology, multiple studies have reported that HSPH1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers8. Consistently, network-based analyses indicate that HSPH1 is closely associated with numerous malignancie9and pan-cancer transcriptomic surveys show that HSPH1 expression is significantly elevated in the majority of tumor types10. Some members of the HSP family have established roles in HCC and other cancers – for example, HSP70 has been identified as a molecular marker of early hepatocarcinogenesis11,12and inhibiting HSP90 is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to overcome oncogene addiction and tumor stress responses13. Additionally, HSP90B1 (GRP94) has been shown to function as an oncoprotein in certain malignancies14. However, despite evidence that HSPH1 may play important roles in other tumors (such as lung cancer), its expression characteristics and clinical significance in HCC have not been well characterized15.

In this study, we investigated the expression and clinical relevance of HSPH1 in HCC through an integrated approach. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to evaluate HSPH1 expression levels in HCC tissues and to assess its value for diagnosis and prognosis. We also conducted pathway enrichment and immune infiltration analyses to explore the potential mechanisms by which HSPH1 may influence HCC progression. Finally, the bioinformatic findings were validated by experiments in liver cancer cell lines and by examining HSPH1 expression in clinical HCC specimens. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to establish HSPH1 as a novel biomarker for HCC and to provide insights into its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

This study included a total of 85 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were hospitalized at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University between May 2015 and December 2019. Clinical data were collected for all patients, including age, sex, clinical stage, and histological grade. Paired tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues were obtained from each patient during surgical resection. Well-differentiated tumors were defined as those in which cancer cells exhibited morphology resembling normal hepatocytes, with preserved acinar or trabecular structures. Poorly differentiated tumors were characterized by marked cellular atypia and disrupted tissue architecture. For Western blot analysis, seven pairs of fresh HCC tissues and corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected immediately after surgical resection, placed on ice, and subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen under sterile conditions before being stored at − 80 °C. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), tissue specimens were immediately fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, sectioned into 5-mm-thick frozen slices, and stored at − 80 °C until further use. Inclusion criteria for patient enrollment were as follows: (1) histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC; (2) age between 18 and 90 years; (3) eligibility for curative surgical resection without prior neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (4) absence of significant contraindications to surgery; (5) no known endocrine or metabolic disorders; and (6) no history of psychiatric illness. All patients were followed for a minimum of five years. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (Approval No. LS20150623). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians. All procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The chromosomal location and basic annotation of the human HSPH1 gene were obtained from the NCBI Gene database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/)16. The subcellular localization of the HSPH1 protein was predicted and visualized using the COMPARTMENTS database (https://compartments.jensenlab.org/)17. To investigate the potential disease associations of HSPH1, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) (https://ctdbase.org/) was utilized19. In addition, the differential expression of HSPH1 across various cancer types was analyzed using the TIMER database (http://timer.cistrome.org/)19.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) was used to obtain transcriptomic and clinical data related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TCGA is one of the largest cancer genomics platforms, providing comprehensive datasets including gene expression profiles, copy number variations, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and other molecular data. In addition, two independent microarray datasets,GSE14520andGSE76427, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for further analysis and validation.

We used the UALCAN online platform (https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/ ) to examine HSPH1 mRNA expression in HCC and to evaluate its association with clinical tumor stage20. We also utilized the GEPIA2 web server (http://gepia2 . cancer-pku. cn/#index) to compareHSPH1expression between HCC and normal liver tissues using an ANOVA approach. Gene expression datasets from GEO were downloaded in MINiML format, containing complete platform, sample, and series records. For each dataset lacking prior normalization, a log2transformation was applied. Datasets without proper standardization underwent quantile normalization using the function from the R preprocessCore package. We mapped probe IDs to gene symbols based on platform annotations, removed probes mapping to multiple genes, and averaged the expression values of multiple probes mapping to the same gene. To correct for batch effects, we applied the function from R’s limma package both within individual datasets and across merged datasets (after intersecting their gene lists and labeling each batch). We evaluated data normalization using box plots and assessed batch effect removal by comparing principal component analysis (PCA) plots before and after correction21.

The Kaplan–Meier Plotter online database (https://kmplot.com/analysis/)22was utilized to assess the association between HSPH1 expression and survival outcomes in HCC patients. Using microarray data and HSPH1-specific probe sets, we compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between high and low HSPH1 expression groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals and log-rankP-values were calculated to determine the significance of the survival differences.

We constructed a protein–protein interaction network for HSPH1 using the STRING database (http://string-db . org)23. Interactions with a combined confidence score > 0. 40 were considered significant and included in the network visualization, highlighting proteins that are potentially co-expressed or functionally associated with HSPH1.

Patients were stratified into high-HSPH1 and low-HSPH1 groups based on the median expression level ofHSPH1. GSEA was then performed to identify signaling pathways differentially enriched between the two groups. We used the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, version 7. 0) as the source of curated gene sets for this analysis. Pathways that were significantly enriched (adjustedP< 0. 05) in either group were identified, and their normalized enrichment scores (NES) were used to rank their enrichment levels. GSEA was applied to gain insight into the biological significance of HSPH1-associated expression patterns24.

We employed the CIBERSORT algorithm to estimate the immune cell composition within the HCC tumor microenvironment. CIBERSORT uses a support vector regression-based deconvolution approach with a reference gene signature matrix of 547 genes to infer the proportions of 22 human immune cell phenotypes (including various T-cell, B-cell, plasma cell, and myeloid subsets). By applying CIBERSORT to our expression data, we estimated the fraction of each immune cell type in every HCC sample and examined how these inferred immune cell abundances correlated with HSPH1 expression25.

The cell lines used in this study (LO2, Huh7, MHCC97H, Hep-3B, and SK-HEP-1) were obtained from Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). Among them, LO2 is a normal human liver cell line and was used as a control to represent non-tumor hepatic cells. Huh7, MHCC97H, Hep-3B, and SK-HEP-1 are established hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, each exhibiting different degrees of differentiation and metastatic potential. These cell lines are widely used as in vitro models for studying HCC biology and therapeutic response.

Total proteins were extracted from frozen tissues and cultured cells using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was quantified by BCA assay. Equal amounts of protein (30–50 µg) were separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against HSPH1 (Proteintech, Cat No. 13383-1-AP, 1:1000 dilution), GAPDH (Proteintech, Cat No. 10494-1-AP, 1:5000 dilution), and HRP-Goat Anti-Rabbit Recombinant Secondary Antibody (H + L) (ZYID002-0050, ZUNYAN, Nanjing, China). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (BeyoECL Moon, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (version 1. 53 t, National Institutes of Health, USA).

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue Sect. (5 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6. 0). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated overnight with primary anti-HSPH1 antibody. After applying HRP-labeled secondary antibodies, color development was performed using DAB solution, followed by hematoxylin counterstaining.

Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well plates and cultured for 48–72 h. After removing the medium, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then washed with cold PBS (4 °C) three times and permeabilized with PBS containing 0. 1–0. 25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubating the cells with 10% goat serum (Beyotime, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The next day, after thorough washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Beyotime, China) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 10 min. Finally, coverslips were mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (Phygene, China) to preserve fluorescence, and images were captured using an Olympus BX83 fluorescence microscope (Japan) with identical exposure settings for all samples.

All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25. 0 (Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was used to evaluate associations between categorical variables. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Variables withP< 0. 1 in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate Cox model. A P value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Unless otherwise stated, all quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) ofat least three independent experiments. Each in vitro assay (e.g., Western blot, CCK-8, colony formation) was independently repeated three times to confirm reproducibility.

HSPH1 (Heat Shock Protein Family H Member 1), a member of the HSP110 family, is located on chromosome 13q12. 3. According to the NCBI Gene database, it encodes a molecular chaperone involved in protein homeostasis. The COMPARTMENTS database predicts that HSPH1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.1A and B). The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) reports associations between HSPH1 and various types of cancers including liver, breast, and skin cancers (Fig.1C). Additionally, a pan-cancer transcriptomic analysis using TCGA data via the TIMER database shows that HSPH1 expression is elevated in multiple tumor types such as breast carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and kidney clear cell carcinoma (Fig.1D).

Given prior evidence of HSPH1 overexpression in various solid tumors, we next investigated its expression pattern and clinical relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). UALCAN database analysis showed that HSPH1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues (Fig.2A). Consistently, analysis of two GEO datasets (GSE14520andGSE76427) demonstrated markedly higherHSPH1expression in HCC samples compared to adjacent normal tissues (Fig.2B). Cancer staging analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between HSPH1 expression and clinical stage (I–IV) in HCC patients, with HSPH1 levels increasing progressively with tumor advancement (Fig.2C, D). This trend was further validated using the ENCORI platform, which confirmed significantly higher HSPH1 expression in HCC tissues relative to normal liver (Fig.2E). At the protein level, immunohistochemistry data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) also showed elevated HSPH1 protein expression in HCC tissues compared to non-tumor liver (Fig.2F). Collectively, these results indicate that HSPH1 is upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in HCC, suggesting a potential oncogenic role in liver cancer initiation and progression.

To examine the relationship between HSPH1 expression and patient survival, we performed Kaplan–Meier survival analyses using multiple public datasets. In the KMplot database, HCC patients were stratified into high and low expression groups by an optimal cutoff, and the results revealed that high HSPH1 expression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (Fig.3A). To enhance confidence in this observation, we validated the finding using GEO datasetsGSE14520andGSE76427. Consistent with the KMplot results, elevated HSPH1 expression correlated with poorer OS in these HCC cohorts (Fig.3B). Furthermore, analysis of the TCGA-LIHC cohort via the GEPIA2 platform also demonstrated that high HSPH1 expression was significantly linked to unfavorable OS and DFS (Fig.3C). Collectively, these results suggest that HSPH1 overexpression may serve as a potential prognostic indicator of adverse outcomes in HCC.

(C) Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS and DFS in HCC patients based on HSPH1 expression using the GEPIA database.

To further explore the molecular mechanisms involving HSPH1 in HCC, we constructed a PPI network for HSPH1 using the STRING database (Fig.4A). The analysis revealed strong predicted interactions between HSPH1 and multiple molecular chaperones. Top-ranking interaction partners included HSPA8 (combined score = 0. 998), BAG2 (0. 995), HSPA1B. Most of these proteins belong to the heat shock protein family and are involved in cellular stress responses, protein folding, and protein degradation processes. To assess the clinical significance of these HSPH1-interacting proteins, we analyzed their prognostic value in HCC using the Kaplan–Meier Plotter. We found that elevated expression of most HSPH1 interactors was significantly associated with worse OS in HCC patients. Additionally, GEPIA2 analysis confirmed that many of these co-chaperones are overexpressed in HCC tissues compared to normal liver, suggesting that they may cooperatively contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPH1 likely exerts its oncogenic effects not in isolation but through coordinated interactions within a broader chaperone network, thereby enhancing cellular stress resilience and promoting malignant progression in HCC.

To systematically explore the potential biological functions of HSPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we downloaded theGSE14520dataset from the GEO database and performed differential gene expression analysis by stratifying samples into high- and low-expression groups based on the median expression of HSPH1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were then applied to comprehensively assess the HSPH1-associated signaling pathways.

GSEA results revealed that the high-HSPH1 expression group showed significant enrichment in multiple pathways related to cell proliferation and genomic stability, including cell cycle, DNA replication, p53 signaling pathway, and Fanconi anemia pathway (Fig.4B). These pathways are well known to be closely involved in tumor cell cycle regulation, DNA synthesis, and damage repair.

KEGG enrichment analysis further indicated that HSPH1 is implicated in a variety of cancer-related signaling pathways, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (hsa05225), pathways in cancer (hsa05200), colorectal cancer, and breast cancer (Fig.4C). Additionally, HSPH1 was enriched in liver-specific metabolic processes, including retinol metabolism, cytochrome P450–mediated drug metabolism, bile secretion, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and complement and coagulation cascades (Fig.4D).

In summary, these results suggest that HSPH1 may play critical roles in HCC by participating in cell cycle regulation, nucleic acid metabolism, and liver-specific metabolic pathways, highlighting its potential functional significance in tumorigenesis and progression of liver cancer.

We next assessed the relationship between HSPH1 expression and immune cell infiltration. The tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of immune cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix components, cytokines, and various physicochemical factors, plays a critical role in tumor initiation, progression, and response to therapy. In this study, we analyzed the infiltration levels of various immune cell types and their correlation with HSPH1 expression to investigate the potential role of HSPH1 in modulating the immune landscape of HCC (Fig.5A, B). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that HSPH1 expression was associated with the infiltration levels of multiple immune cell subsets (Fig.5C). Specifically, HSPH1 expression showed a positive correlation with activated memory CD4⁺ T cells, M0 macrophages, and M1 macrophages. In contrast, it was negatively correlated with regulatory T cells (Tregs), resting mast cells, and activated NK cells(Fig.5D). These correlations were further validated using the TIMER2. 0 platform based on TCGA data(Fig.5E). Collectively, these findings suggest that HSPH1 may influence the composition of immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment, particularly those involved in antigen presentation and inflammatory responses. This provides a foundation for further investigation into the potential immunoregulatory functions of HSPH1 in HCC.

To experimentally validate the upregulation of HSPH1 suggested by bioinformatics analysis, we assessed its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and liver cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis of eight paired fresh HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues demonstrated a marked increase in HSPH1 protein levels in tumor tissues compared to matched normal controls (Fig.6A). Furthermore, Western blot assays conducted on a panel of liver cancer cell lines (Hep-3B, Huh7, MHCC97H, SK-HEP-1) and the normal hepatic cell line LO2 revealed that HSPH1 expression was consistently higher in cancer cell lines, with particularly prominent overexpression observed in Hep-3B and Huh7 cells (Fig.6B). Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining confirmed that HSPH1 protein levels were elevated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues, with predominant localization in the cytoplasm and partial presence in the nucleus (Fig.6C). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining further demonstrated that HSPH1 was distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of Huh7 and LO-2 cells (Fig.6D). Together, these results corroborate our computational predictions and confirm that HSPH1 is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and liver cancer cell lines, suggesting its potential role in hepatocarcinogenesis. To investigate the biological function of HSPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we silenced HSPH1 expression in Huh7 and Hep3B cells using siRNA. Western blot analysis confirmed the efficient knockdown of HSPH1 at the protein level in both cell lines (Fig.6E). CCK-8 assays revealed a significant decrease in cell viability upon HSPH1 silencing, indicating impaired cell proliferation (Fig.6F). Furthermore, colony formation assays demonstrated that knockdown of HSPH1 markedly suppressed the clonogenic capacity of Huh7 and Hep3B cells (Fig.6G), and the quantitative analysis confirmed a significant reduction in colony numbers (Fig.6H).

To further investigate the clinical relevance of HSPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we classified patients into high and low HSPH1 expression groups and analyzed the association between HSPH1 levels and various clinicopathological features (Table1). Statistical analysis revealed that high HSPH1 expression was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage (P= 0. 04), poor pathological differentiation (P= 0. 03), and elevated serum AFP levels (P= 0. 02). In contrast, no significant correlation was observed between HSPH1 expression and patient age (P= 0. 38), gender (P= 0. 384), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR,P= 0. 48), or platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR,P= 0. 19). These results suggest that elevated HSPH1 expression is associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics in HCC patients.

To evaluate the prognostic significance of HSPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we conducted both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses (Table2). In univariate analysis, high HSPH1 expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival (HR = 2. 00, 95% CI: 1. 30–3. 00,P= 0. 002), along with advanced TNM stage, poor pathological differentiation, elevated NLR, and high PLR (allP< 0. 05). Multivariate Cox analysis further confirmed that high HSPH1 expression remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis (HR = 1. 70, 95% CI: 1. 15–2. 50,P= 0. 02), as did advanced TNM stage (P= 0. 004) and poor histological grade (P= 0. 028). Other variables including age, gender, NLR, and PLR were not independently associated with survival in the multivariate model.

Additionally, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high HSPH1 expression had significantly shorter overall survival compared to those with low expression levels (Fig.7). Collectively, these findings indicate that HSPH1 serves as an independent adverse prognostic biomarker in HCC and may have clinical utility in risk stratification.

HSPH1 (also known as HSP105/HSP110) has emerged as an important oncoprotein in HCC. Consistent with our results, multiple studies report that HSPH1 is markedly overexpressed in HCC tumors compared to normal live26. This overexpression is not unique to HCC – HSPH1 is frequently upregulated across diverse malignancies (e.g., head and neck, gastrointestinal, lung cancers) and is associated with advanced tumor stage and poor outcomes27,28.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that high HSP family expression (including HSPH1) is significantly associated with worse overall survival in HCC patients. Furthermore, HSPH1 overexpression often accompanies more aggressive tumor features: one large cohort study showed that HSPs (including HSPH1) are elevated in HCC and linked to greater invasiveness and advanced stage29. Similarly, in cutaneous melanoma, metastatic lesions had higher HSP105/HSPH1 levels than primary tumors30reinforcing a connection between HSPH1 upregulation and tumor metastasis.

Mechanistically, HSPH1 appears to promote tumor progression through multiple pathways. As a member of the HSP70 superfamily, HSPH1 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) and molecular chaperone to safeguard protein folding and stability31. This function can protect oncogenic client proteins from degradation. For example, in aggressive B-cell lymphomas, HSPH1 was shown to interact with and stabilize the oncoproteins c-Myc and Bcl-6; silencingHSPH1caused loss of these oncoproteins and tumor growth arrest32.

Notably, HSPH1 has been identified as part of the β-catenin degradation complex: HSPH1 overexpression promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling by preventing β-catenin degradation33. Conversely, HSPH1 depletion destabilizes β-catenin and reduces Wnt target gene expression, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth.

These multifaceted pro-oncogenic roles likely contribute to the growth advantage conferred by HSPH1 upregulation and may explain its association with worse clinical outcomes.

Importantly, HSPH1 may also affect the tumor immune microenvironment. Tumor-derived HSPs are known to modulate anti-tumor immunity34and HSPH1 is no exception. In our study, HSPH1 expression correlated with the levels of certain immune cell infiltrates in HCC tissues. Supporting this, Li et al. identified HSPH1 as a factor linking intratumor genomic heterogeneity to immune heterogeneity in HCC, particularly via effects on macrophage polarization35. In that study, high HSPH1 expression was suggested to drive an immunosuppressive microenvironment in liver cancer36. This aligns with findings in colorectal cancer: Berthenet et al. reported that extracellular HSP110 (HSPH1) released by tumor cells skews macrophages toward an M2 phenotype, promoting an immunosuppressive, tumor-favoring niche37.

HSPH1 may also intersect with immune checkpoint pathways and responses to immunotherapy. Chen et al. (2023) identified HSPH1 as one of five immune-related genes predictive of prognosis and immunotherapy benefit in HCC38. Likewise, in non-small cell lung cancer, high HSPH1 was linked to poor prognosis and to changes in the tumor immune milieu39suggesting that HSPH1’s pro-tumor effects may involve blunting anti-tumor immune responses.

The strong association of HSPH1 with HCC aggressiveness suggests that HSPH1 could be a useful prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Clinically, HSPH1 overexpression might indicate higher-risk disease. In our analysis and public cohorts, HCC patients with high HSPH1 had significantly shorter survival and higher recurrence rates (even in early-stage cases)40. Such patients may warrant closer surveillance and consideration of adjuvant treatments. Therapeutically, inhibiting HSPH1 could impair tumor growth by destabilizing oncoproteins and potentially enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.

There is emerging evidence supporting the therapeutic targeting of HSPH1. For example, a first-in-class HSP110 inhibitor (AN-329) was recently shown to bind the nucleotide-binding domain of HSPH1, abolish its chaperone function, and suppress cancer cell proliferation in preclinical breast cancer models41. In that study, HSPH1 inhibition caused cell-cycle arrest via inactivation of STAT3/c-Myc signaling, mirroring the effect of HSPH1 knockdown42. Immunotherapeutic approaches against HSPH1 are also being explored. HSPH1 has been identified as an immunogenic antigen recognized by cytotoxic T cells43and in a phase I trial of an HSP105 peptide vaccine in advanced cancers, vaccine-induced HSPH1-specific T cells were associated with tumor stabilization and improved survival44.

In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive characterization of the expression pattern, potential clinical significance, and functional roles of HSPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Integrated bioinformatic analyses, along with preliminary experimental validation, suggest that HSPH1 is upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissues and cell lines. Western blot analysis indicated increased expression of HSPH1 in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. In addition, knockdown of HSPH1 appeared to reduce cell proliferation and clonogenic capacity, as shown by CCK-8 and colony formation assays, implying a possible role of HSPH1 in maintaining tumor cell growth.

Clinically, elevated HSPH1 expression was found to be associated with more aggressive tumor features, such as advanced stage and poor differentiation, and may serve as an independent indicator of unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. Functional enrichment analyses further implied that HSPH1 might be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis by influencing cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and metabolic processes. Immune profiling analysis also suggested that HSPH1 expression correlates with an immunosuppressive microenvironment, potentially involving tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells.

Taken together, these findings indicate that HSPH1 could be a candidate prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC. However, further in-depth mechanistic studies and validation in larger cohorts are warranted to better elucidate its role and clinical utility.

Despite the comprehensive approach of our study, several limitations should be noted. First, our analyses relied on retrospective data from public databases (TCGA and GEO), which may carry inherent biases despite normalization and batch correction. Second, while we confirmed that HSPH1 is upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, we did not perform functional experiments to directly investigate its role in HCC progression. Third, our clinical sample size was moderate and from a single center, potentially limiting generalizability. Future studies with larger cohorts and mechanistic experiments (e.g., HSPH1 knockdown or overexpression) are needed to validate and extend our findings.

In summary, this study suggests that HSPH1 plays a multifaceted oncogenic role in HCC. HSPH1 overexpression in HCC may contribute to malignant phenotypes in part by maintaining the stability of oncogenic proteins (e.g., β-catenin, c-Myc) and by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment toward pro-tumor phenotypes. Clinically, elevated HSPH1 is associated with advanced stage, poorer survival, and possibly therapy resistance. These findings highlight HSPH1 as a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC. Future studies could focus on elucidating the mechanistic role of HSPH1 and developing HSPH1-targeted therapies. Given the emerging success of other HSP inhibitors in cancer, targeting HSPH1 – alone or in combination with immunotherapies – could represent a novel approach to curb HCC progression and improve patient outcomes.
