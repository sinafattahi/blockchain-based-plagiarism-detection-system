Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women of reproductive age globally. In East Africa, cervical cancer presents a substantial public health challenge. Although previous studies have attempted to assess its prevalence and determine the associated factors, their findings have often been inconsistent and inconclusive. To address this gap, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis, aiming to provide clearer insights into the prevalence and determinants of cervical cancer screening in the region.

The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO under the reference number CRD42024563102. We systematically searched of multiple databases, including PubMed, Hinari, Embase, Scopus, Epistimonikos, African Journals Online, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. We included observational studies published between January 1, 2019, and September 2, 2024. The search results were retrieved and organized using Rayyan software. The data analysis was done using Stata version 17 software. The heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed prior to pooling the estimates.

A total of 12,700 women included from 24 articles. The overall estimated pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening was 19.22% (95% CI 14.69, 23.74). Age 40–49 years (AOR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.41, 4.73), government employment (AOR = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.61, 3.93), marriage (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.15, 4.46), divorce (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI: 0.13, 43.54), parity of more than four (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.5, 3.93), good knowledge (AOR = 4.31; 95% CI: 2.72, 6.83), high perceived severity (AOR = 1.63; 95% CI: 0.63, 4.22), high perceived benefit (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.98, 3.05), low perceived barriers (AOR = 2.25; 95% CI: 0.77, 6.60), modern contraceptives use (AOR = 1.18; 95% CI: 0.52, 2.65), know someone with cervical cancer (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI: 0.70, 6.40), and favorable attitude (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.66, 4.17) were significantly associated with cervical cancer screening utilization.

Cervical cancer screening uptake remains low in East Africa due to factors like demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and personal connections to the disease. Empowering women and enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions are essential strategies to improve screening practices.

Cervical cancer is the second leading cancer and the second major cause of cancer-related mortality among women of reproductive age worldwide [1,2]. In 2020, GLOBOCAN estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths from cervical cancer globally, with about 90% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) recorded the highest incidence and mortality, with the highest age-standardized incidence rates observed in eastern Africa (40 cases per 100,000 women-years) [1,3–5].

Cervical cancer is both preventable and treatable when identified at an early stage. Despite its curability, it remains a cause of death among women in developing countries, who often seek help only after developing advanced symptoms and complications [6,7]. A comprehensive approach, including prevention, early diagnosis, effective screening, and treatment programs for pre-cervical lesions, is essential for the prevention of cervical cancer. Several screening methods currently exist, including cytology or Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing, visual inspection using acetic acid, and HPV DNA testing. The Pap smear is the most common method used in low- and middle-income countries [8–10].

Early screening with prompt treatment is an economical way to prevent cervical cancer. The WHO recommends that cervical cancer screening begin at age 30 for all sexually active women, with earlier initiation for sexually active and HIV-positive women [11]. According to the CDC, screening should start at age 21 with a Pap test every three years for women aged 21–29, while women aged 30–65 are advised to undergo primary HPV testing every five years, co-testing (HPV and Pap) every five years, or continue with Pap testing every three years, based on clinical recommendations. For women over 65 with a history of normal screening results, screening may no longer be necessary. These guidelines aim to optimize early detection while minimizing unnecessary interventions in low-risk populations [12].

Cervical cancer screening programs and their uptake are limited in low- and middle-income countries. A study reported that coverage of cervical cancer screening in developing countries averages only 19%, compared to 63% in developed countries [13]. There is no estimated pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening in East Africa. However, the pooled prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa has been reported as 12.12% (95% CI: 9.48–14.76) [14].

In many LMICs, while screening programs exist, they tend to be opportunistic and poorly organized. Consequently, these programs often fail to achieve a significant impact, leading to low screening uptake [15,16]. The uptake of cervical cancer screening can be influenced by numerous factors, including women’s knowledge, attitudes, health orientations, early sexual practices, having a first baby before age 20, multiple sexual partners, and low socioeconomic status. Therefore, addressing the various barriers to cervical cancer screening utilization is an essential component of intervention strategies [17–20].

Cervical cancer poses a significant public health challenge in East Africa, where screening rates among eligible women are notably low. To improve screening and treatment initiatives, it’s crucial to identify the factors influencing participation. This meta-analytic review aims to estimate the overall cervical cancer screening uptake among East African women and to identify its predictors. By synthesizing existing research, we hope to uncover barriers and facilitators that can inform effective public health strategies to enhance cervical cancer prevention in the region.

The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO under the reference number CRD42024563102, and the reporting adheres to the PRISMA-2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist [21](Fig.1).

This review included studies that reported on cervical cancer screening utilization or both screening utilization and its predictors among women aged 21 years and older in East Africa. We included observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort designs) published in English between January 1, 2019, and September 2, 2024. Studies were excluded if they were case reports, experimental or qualitative studies, surveillance data (e.g., demographic health surveys), unpublished works (e.g., repository files, reports, or grey literature), conference abstracts, preprints, or articles without full-text access. Additionally, studies that focused exclusively on healthcare professionals or did not report the outcome of interest were excluded. For duplicate publications, only the full-text version was retained for analysis.

A comprehensive search was carried out across all identified databases and associated websites. We searched all published articles using databases including PubMed, Hinari, Embase, Scopus, Epistimonikos, African Journal online, Science direct and Google Scholar. We conducted a search by combining MeSH terms such as: “cervical cancer” OR “Cervical neoplasm” OR “Cervix neoplasm” OR “cervical ca” OR “cervix ca” AND “Screening uptake” OR “Screening utilization” OR “Early Detection” OR “Cancer Screening” OR “Cancer Test” OR “Early Diagnosis” OR “Cancer Diagnosis” AND “East Africa” OR “Burundi” OR “Djibouti” OR “Eritrea” OR “Ethiopia” OR “Kenya” OR “Madagascar” OR “Malawi” OR “Mozambique” OR “Somalia” OR “South Sudan” OR “Sudan” OR “Tanzania” OR “Uganda” OR “Zambia” OR “Zimbabwe”.

These search terms provide a comprehensive strategy that covers all fields in records as well as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms). This study also used the Boolean operator combining terms with in categories using the “OR” operator, and linking categories with the “AND” operator. Searches were carried out between August 31, 2024, and September 2, 2024 and it included studies conducted from January 1, 2019 to September 2, 2024. The search results were retrieved and organized using Rayyan software. Additionally, the search was also conducted through the reference lists of the identified studies to locate additional articles. The CoCoPop framework, Condition (cervical cancer), Context (East Africa), and Population (adult women aged 21 and above, was used to guide the search process for relevant literature and data sources. Selection process was conducted in multiple steps: three reviewers (HTE, WT and HKN) independently assessed the articles based on their titles, abstracts, and full texts, with any disagreements resolved by consensus of other reviewers (TA, MG, HA and YYG).

The population of interest was all eligible women for cervical cancer screening in East Africa, with the main outcome being cervical cancer screening utilization among women aged 21 and older. The Factors examined in the review included age, marital status, educational status, place of residency, occupational status, knowledge of cervical cancer screening, perceived susceptibility, benefits, barrier and severity of cervical cancer and its screening, attitudes towards screening, Parity, age at first sex, discussions with healthcare professionals, family history of cervical cancer, contraceptives use, knew someone with cervical cancer as well as history of sexually transmitted infections and multiple sexual partners. Comparisons for each factor were made using the reference group reported for that specific variable in each study.

Duplicate studies were eliminated after being exported to Rayyan software [22]. Data abstraction, full-text review, and abstract review were completed by three separate reviewers (HTE, HKN, and WT). When there is disagreement among the reviewers, other reviewers (TA, MG, HA and YYG) resolved any disagreements that arose by the three authors on inclusion and data collection through discussion. Ultimately, studies with prevalence or both prevalence and related variables that were published in respectable journals were chosen for a full text review.

The PRISMA guidelines were utilized to clearly outline the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, along with the reasons for exclusion. A structured data abstraction form was created to gather and present key details in tables, including the author’s name, publication year, country, response rate, study setting, design, sample size, population, prevalence, adjusted associated factors and predictors, as well as effect sizes (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. To reduce the influence of extreme estimates on the pooled results, outlier estimates were transformed accordingly.

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the degree of evidence and bias risk in research (NOS) [23]. Studies were rated based on NOS criteria into three categories: Very Good (9–10 points), Good (7–8 points), and Satisfactory (5–6 points). The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) framework was applied for both analyzing and presenting the findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis.

We conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I² statistic, calculated and interpreted according to the method described by Higgins et al. [24]. To explore potential sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were performed. Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of funnel plots and quantitatively using Egger’s regression test [25]. To adjust for publication bias, the Duval and Tweedie nonparametric trim and fill method was applied. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by sequentially omitting one study at a time to evaluate the robustness of the pooled estimates. For factors associated with cervical cancer screening utilization, pooled adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 17 software.

A total of 3476 studies were retrieved, with 599 duplicates, 110 full-text articles were assessed for further eligibility. Finally, 24 articles with 12,700 women were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis (Fig.1).

The review included a total of 12,700 women from 24 articles published between January 1, 2019, and September 2, 2024, aimed at estimating the pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening in East Africa. The studies spanned five countries, with 19 studies from Ethiopia, 2 from Rwanda and 1 each from Malawi, Kenya and Uganda. All of the included studies employed a cross-sectional design, with 12 being community-based and the remainder institution-based (Table1).

Using the 10-item Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias assessment tool, we evaluated the risk of bias for each of included studies included (Table1). In terms of study quality, 3 studies (12.5%) were rated as very good, 15 studies (62.5%) were rated as good, and 6 studies (25%) were rated as satisfactory.

The overall estimated pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening was 19.22% (95% CI 14.69, 23.74). Besides, there was high level of heterogeneity since I2statistics is 98.4%,p< 0.001 (forest plot and galbraith plot (Figs.2and3)).

In order to identify potential sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was done based on country, study design, article quality and study population characteristics (Table2). The sub group analysis showed that the lowest prevalence of cervical cancer screening was from study found in Ethiopia and Kenya (18%), while the highest prevalence was studies found in Malawi (34%). The highest prevalence of cervical cancer screening was among institution based cross-sectional studies (21% [14,50] I2= 98.43%). In addition, the pooled sub-group analysis showed articles with Very good quality had highest prevalence (23% [11,51] I2= 0.00%) while the Good quality articles had the lowest prevalence (18% [13,23] I2= 98.10%). Further sub-group analysis was also done by study population characteristics and the findings showed the highest pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening was among women live with HIV (39% [16,52] I2= 0.00%) and the lowest was among women age > = 21 (16% [12,21] I2= 98.1%).

The assessment of publication bias was conducted using a funnel plot and the Egger’s regression test. An uneven distribution in the funnel plot (Fig.4) serves as a subjective indicator of publication bias. Additionally, the Egger’s regression test yielded an objective p-value of 0.000 (Table3), indicating the likelihood of publication bias. In response, we performed the Duval and Tweedie nonparametric trim and fill analysis within a random-effects framework to address this bias. This analysis resulted in the inclusion of six additional studies in our overall assessment. The purpose of this adjustment is to achieve a more balanced and unbiased estimate of the pooled effect, thereby enhancing the credibility of our review’s conclusions (Fig.5).

Number of studies = 30, observed = 24, imputed = 6 (Table3).

In Meta trim and fill analysis, the overall prevalence increases from 19.22 to 23.64% with the inclusion of six studies. After trim and fill, the funnel plot showed that some studies are included in the symmetrical region and that is better than the previous funnel plot.

We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of each study on the total effect size concerning cervical cancer screening. The Der Simonian-Laird random-effects model sensitivity analysis revealed that no individual study significantly affected the overall proportion of cervical cancer screening in East Africa, as shown in Fig.6.

In this meta-analysis, we assessed various factors related to cervical cancer screening utilization. For each variable considered, an independent analysis was conducted. The factors analyzed included age, marital status, educational status, place of residency, occupational status, knowledge of cervical cancer screening, perceived susceptibility, benefits, barriers, and severity of cervical cancer and its screening, attitudes towards screening, parity, age at first sexual intercourse, discussions with healthcare professionals, family history of cervical cancer, contraceptive use, knowing someone with cervical cancer, as well as a history of sexually transmitted infections and multiple sexual partners.

Participants aged 40–49 years were 2.58 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening compared to those aged 30–39 years (AOR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.41, 4.73) as showed in Fig.7. There was no statistically significant association between educational status, rural residency, employment as self-employed, and the utilization of cervical cancer screening (Table4). Government employment among women was significantly associated with the utilization of cervical cancer screening. The pooled random effect indicated that women employed by the government were 1.55 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening compared to house wives (AOR = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.61, 3.93) (Fig.8). Married women were 18% less likely to utilize cervical cancer screening compared to single women (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.15, 4.46) (Fig.9). In contrast, divorced women were 2.32 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening compared to single women (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI: 0.13, 43.54) (Fig.10).

Women with a parity of more than four were 1.4 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening compared to women with fewer than four children (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.5, 3.93) (Fig.11). However, factors such as being sexually active before the age of 18, having a history of sexually transmitted infections, having multiple sexual partners, high perceived susceptibility to cervical cancer, discussions with healthcare professionals about cervical cancer, and having a family history of cervical cancer showed no significant association with the utilization of cervical cancer screening (Table4).

Participants with good knowledge of cervical cancer were 4.31 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening compared to those with poor knowledge (AOR = 4.31; 95% CI: 2.72, 6.83) (Fig.12). Women who perceived a high severity of cervical cancer were 1.63 times more likely to get screened than those with a low perception of severity (AOR = 1.63; 95% CI: 0.63, 4.22) (Fig.13).

Additionally, women who perceived a high benefit of cervical cancer screening were 1.73 times more likely to undergo screening compared to those with a low perceived benefit (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.98, 3.05) (Fig.14). Women with low perceived barriers to cervical cancer screening were 2.25 times more likely to get screened compared to those with high perceived barriers (AOR = 2.25; 95% CI: 0.77, 6.60) (Fig.15).

Furthermore, women who used contraceptives were 1.18 times more likely to screen for cervical cancer than those who did not use contraceptives (AOR = 1.18; 95% CI: 0.52, 2.65) (Fig.16). Women who knew someone with cervical cancer were 2.12 times more likely to undergo screening compared to those who did not know anyone with the disease (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI: 0.70, 6.40) (Fig.17). Finally, women with a favorable attitude toward cervical cancer screening were 2.63 times more likely to get screened than those who did not have a favorable attitude (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.66, 4.17) (Fig.18).

This systematic review and meta-analysis pooled data from 24 studies on cervical cancer screening in east Africa. Being aged 40–49, government employment, marital status (married or divorced), having more than four children, good knowledge of cervical cancer, high perceived severity and benefits, low perceived barriers, a positive attitude toward screening, contraceptive use, and knowing someone with cervical cancer Significantly associated with cervical cancer screening utilization included. The findings provide valuable evidence for improving policies and practices to enhance the use of cervical cancer screening services in the region.

The pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening in East Africa, at 19.22% (95% CI: 14.69, 23.74), aligns with studies conducted in Ethiopia, which reported rates of 19.8%, 18.5% and 18.17%, as well as a study in Nepal, India and Baghdad, which found a prevalence of 17%, 18.4% and 18.8% respectively [50,53–57]. However, the pooled prevalence is higher than findings from other meta-analyses conducted in Ethiopia, where the screening rates were 14.79% and 13.46% respectively [58,59]. It also surpasses the cervical cancer screening prevalence reported for sub-Saharan Africa, which was 12.87% [14]. On the other hand, the pooled rate is lower than Qatar (42.2%) [60], Saudi Arabia (26.2%) [51], the 30% screening prevalence observed in another study from sub-Saharan Africa [61] and study conducted in 57 countries in which cervical cancer coverage rage from 40 to 60% [13]. The cervical cancer screening rate in East Africa is significantly lower than in developed nations such as Korea(75.5%), Thailand(67.4%), Japan (32.0%), the UK (78%), Finland (79.2%), and Spain (65.6%) [62–67]. Variations in cervical cancer screening rates can be attributed to differences in healthcare systems, access to reproductive health services, and the implementation of screening programs across regions. Additionally, disparities in study areas, sample sizes, data collection tools, and sampling methods contribute to inconsistent findings in screening rates. Socioeconomic barriers, such as poverty and lack of health insurance, further restrict access to healthcare, limiting participation in screening programs. Rural areas often face additional challenges, including fewer screening facilities and inadequate funding for preventive care. Moreover, varying levels of knowledge about cervical cancer and screening among populations can significantly influence participation.

In our review, women aged 40–49 demonstrated a significant association with higher cervical cancer screening uptake, aligning with results from a systematic review and meta-analysis in Saharan Africa [14] and studies conducted in Malaysia [68] and Netherlands [69]. This may be because older women are more likely to seek medical care for age or hormone-related concerns and often feel a strong sense of personal responsibility, which increases their likelihood of participating in screening programs.

The pooled random effect indicated that women employed by the government were 1.55 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than unemployed women or housewives. This finding is consistent with studies conducted in USA [70] and Nigeria [71], which also reported higher screening rates among employed women. The consistency across these studies suggests that employment, particularly in structured environments like government jobs, may provide better access to health information and screening services.

In our meta-analysis conducted in East Africa, married women were 18% less likely to utilize cervical cancer screening, which is in line with Thailand that married women were less likely to involve in the cervical cancer screening service delivery [72]. In contrast to a study done in the United States, where being married was associated with increased cervical cancer screening participation, this difference may reflect variations in cultural, social, and healthcare factors between the regions that influence women’s health-seeking behaviors and access to screening services [73]. On the contrary, divorced women showed a higher probability of undergoing cervical cancer screening compared to single women, which aligns with findings from a study in Puerto Rico [74]. However, this result is inconsistent with a study conducted in Ohio, where separated or divorced women had lower odds of utilizing screening service [75]. The variation in these findings may be due to cultural, social, or healthcare access differences between the regions.

Women with a parity of more than four were significantly more likely to utilize cervical cancer screening, a finding consistent with a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of case–control studies [76]. However, parity was not significantly associated with screening utilization in studies conducted in Tanzania and Nepal [77,78]. These discrepancies may be attributed to differences in cultural norms, healthcare infrastructure, or reproductive health priorities across regions.

Participants with a good knowledge of cervical cancer are more likely to participate in screening programs. This result is in line with systematic reviews from Sub-Saharan Africa, low- and middle-income countries, and a study conducted in Malaysia, Uganda and United States. It also supported by the finding of meta-analysis done in Ethiopia. These findings point to the significant impact of knowledge on screening behavior, reinforcing the need for public health efforts that focus on education to increase screening rates across different regions [59,79–83].

In the meta-analysis conducted in East Africa, women who perceived fewer barriers to cervical cancer screening were more likely to undergo screening, which aligns with findings from studies on South Asian women [84]. However, this contrasts with a systematic review in sub-Saharan Africa [85], where high perceived barriers were more closely linked to cervical cancer screening utilization. This discrepancy may stem from differences in the effectiveness of public health interventions and education programs, as well as varying levels of support available to help women overcome these barriers. Additionally, the duration of the studies could also influence the results, as more recent interventions might have better addressed perceptions and facilitated access to screening.

This systematic review and meta-analysis also identified perceived severity of the disease and perceived benefits of screening as predictors of cervical cancer screening uptake, which is supported by multiple studies [8,59,82,86,87]. This could be because participants were aware of the serious consequences of the disease, potentially leading to higher screening rates. However, this finding contrasts with the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in sub-Saharan Africa [14]. The three-year gap between our study and the 2021 sub-Saharan Africa review may help explain some of the differences in findings. In the years since 2021, there could have been progress in public health campaigns, improvements in healthcare infrastructure, or better access to cervical cancer screening, especially in East Africa. Increased awareness and newer policies may have made a real difference, helping people understand the seriousness of cervical cancer and the benefits of screening. These changes could have led to higher screening rates in our more recent study. It shows how much can change in a few years, with ongoing efforts making a real impact on health behaviors.

Modern contraception use was identified as a significant factor influencing cervical cancer screening utilization. This finding aligns with previous studies conducted in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, and India [52,88–90]. One possible explanation is that women using modern contraceptives often receive additional information about cervical cancer and its screening during their family planning visits. Additionally, those who use modern contraceptives may have more frequent contact with healthcare providers compared to non-users, which could further enhance their awareness and encourage them to participate in screening programs.

Knowing someone with cervical cancer was significantly associated with the utilization of cervical cancer screening, which aligns with studies conducted in Ethiopia [87,91]. Furthermore, having a favorable attitude toward cervical cancer screening was also significantly linked to higher screening rates compared to those without such an attitude, consistent with findings from previous studies [87,92–94]. These results highlight the importance of personal connections and positive attitudes in encouraging women to participate in cervical cancer screening programs.

The high heterogeneity and potential publication bias among the studies included in this meta-analysis may have resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect significant associations. Additionally, this review was unable to assess the specific types of screening utilized, indicating a need for further research in this area. It’s worth noting that only English-language articles were included, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, variations in how factors associated with cervical cancer were measured across the included studies might also influence the pooled estimates, potentially affecting the overall conclusions drawn from the analysis.

Cervical cancer screening uptake remains low in East Africa, influenced by factors such as age, employment, marital status, parity, knowledge, attitudes, perceived barriers, contraceptive use, and personal connections to the disease. Empowering women and improving their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions are critical strategies to increase screening rates. Additionally, targeted health outreach and promotion programs are essential to enhance the utilization of cervical cancer screening services in the region.
