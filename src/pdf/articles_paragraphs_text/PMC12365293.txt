Neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) are major targets for the neurophysiological actions of general anesthetics. In the adult brain, cell type-specific effects on synaptic transmission are attributed to the differential sensitivity to volatile anesthetics of specific Navsubtypes preferentially expressed in mature neurons (Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.6). Comparatively, developing neurons are more excitable than mature neurons. We determined volatile anesthetic effects on Na+currents mediated by Nav1.3, the principal Navsubtype expressed in developing neurons. Sevoflurane at clinical concentrations inhibited peak Na+current of human Nav1.3 heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells in a voltage-dependent manner, induced a − 6.1 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, and slowed recovery from fast inactivation. Nav1.3-mediated Na+currents also exhibited distinct activation properties associated with hyperexcitability, including prominent persistent currents and ramp currents, both of which were significantly reduced by sevoflurane. Nav1.3 showed a more depolarized voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation than Nav1.2, consistent with its higher propensity for sustained repetitive firing. Nav1.2 exhibited minimal persistent and ramp currents, and these were unaffected by sevoflurane. These findings identify subtype-specific effects of sevoflurane on neuronal Navsubtype electrophysiological properties, and suggest a mechanistic basis for increased anesthetic sensitivity and toxicity in early neuronal differentiation and maturation.

Voltage-gated Na+channels (Nav) regulate neuronal excitability1–4action potential (AP)-driven Ca2+influx, and Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release3,5–8and are important targets for general anesthetics9–12. Upon neuronal depolarization, Navrapidly activate then inactivate generating an AP, followed by a return to resting membrane potential13. Volatile anesthetics (VA) directly inhibit heterologously expressed Nav11by reducing AP amplitude and nerve terminal depolarization in various neuronal preparations14–17including dissociated neurons from the hippocampus18a major site of anesthetic actions19.

Four major Navsubtypes (Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6) are expressed in the mammalian brain20,21,with Nav1.3 preferentially expressed during early development22,23. In the hippocampus, variable expression of Navsubtypes in specific neuronal populations influences cellular and network excitability due to differential presynaptic and postsynaptic localizations8. Mature inhibitory hippocampal interneurons express more Nav1.1 compared to excitatory pyramidal neurons that express relatively more Nav1.2 and Nav1.624–26. These Navsubtypes are inhibited by VAs in two ways: (1) stabilization of the inactivated state resulting in a shift of steady-state inactivation to more negative membrane potentials, reducing channel availability and slowing recovery from fast-inactivation, and (2) interaction with the open and/or resting state to produce tonic block9,27,28. Voltage- and frequency-dependent block of Nav17,28,29reduces AP amplitude15,30and neurotransmitter release15,31with Navsubtype and neurotransmitter selectivity. For example, isoflurane decreases glutamate release more potently than GABA release from dissociated hippocampal neurons32.This is likely mediated through greater inhibition of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 in glutamatergic boutons compared with lesser inhibition of Nav1.1 in GABAergic boutons18,33.

Heterogeneity in Navexpression also occurs during neuronal differentiation and development. Expression of Navsubtypes with distinct activation properties renders developing neurons hyperexcitable compared to mature neurons22. Compared to other subtypes, Nav1.3 recovers from inactivation four-fold faster and has slower closed-state inactivation, reducing the threshold for activation in neurons that express Nav1.3, leading to sustained repetition firing34–37even with unchanged or absent stimuli. Slower inactivation or resurgent Na+currents enhance repetitive firing and modulate overall neuronal excitability as opposed to AP initiation and propagation38,39. Although persistent Na+currents in acute hippocampal slices are inhibited by isoflurane40,subtype-selective effects of anesthetic sensitivity on developmentally expressed Navhave not been investigated. We examined the effects of sevoflurane on the function of Nav1.3, a major neuronal subtype developmentally expressed in the immature mammalian brain. Comparative studies with Nav1.2 provide a neurophysiological basis for developmental stage-specific impact on neuronal excitability.

The effects of sevoflurane on Nav1.3 currents were tested using a periodic stimulation protocol that allowed us to determine voltage-dependent drug effects10,41,42. To assess peak Na+current (INa) inhibition, a depolarizing pulse to 0 mV was applied every 5 s, following a 100 ms prepulse to eitherV0(–120 mV), where most channels remained in an available resting state, or to a potential at which ~ 50% of channels were in an inactivated stateV½−inact(–47 ± 5 mV). Figure1b shows the time course ofINainhibition during sevoflurane wash-in. The slow onset likely reflects drug partitioning into intracellular compartments rather than an intrinsically slow binding rate to the channel43. Results are expressed as the ratio of peakINain the presence of sevoflurane to controlINa(Fig.1a-c, Supplemental TableS1). Sevoflurane significantly inhibited peakINafollowing a prepulse toV½−inactin a concentration-dependent manner. Time control (sham) experiments using external solution without sevoflurane showed no time-dependent inhibition (Supplemental Fig. S2a, b; Supplemental Table S3). In addition to reducing peakINa, sevoflurane also accelerated macroscopic current decay. For Nav1.3, current decay of inactivation was best fit with a bi-exponential function, consistent with two components of inactivation, and sevoflurane significantly reduced the fast time constantτfastwithout affectingτslow(Supplemental Fig.S1a-c). In contrast, Nav1.2 current decay was adequately fit with a mono-exponential function, andτfastwas similarly reduced by sevoflurane (Supplemental Fig.S1d-f).

Inhibition of peak Nav1.3 current by sevoflurane. Sevoflurane inhibited peak Na+current (INa) in a voltage-dependent manner at concentrations equivalent to 0.5 MAC, 1 MAC, or 2 MAC (0.14 mM, 0.28 mM, or 0.57 mM).a, Macroscopic Na+currents from a transfected HEK293T cell expressing Nav1.3 were evoked using a periodic alternating stimulation protocol (seeinset) in the absence (CTL,black traces) or presence (SEVO,orange traces) of 1 MAC sevoflurane (0.28 mM). Sevoflurane did not inhibit peakINawhen the test pulse followed a prepulse toV0, a potential at which all channels were in the resting state. However, sevoflurane significantly inhibited peakINawith a prepulse toV½−inact, a potential at which half of the channels were in a fast-inactivated state.b, The time course of the effects of wash–in and wash–out of 1 MAC sevoflurane.c, Concentration-dependent inhibition of Nav1.3 current by sevoflurane at 0.5, 1, and 2 MAC (for values, see Supplemental TableS1) following prepulse toV0orV½−inact. All data are mean ± SD,n= 6–7, **P< 0.01vs. control by paired two-tailed Studentt-test (P= 0.0086 for 0.5 MAC;P= 0.0053 for 1 MAC;P= 0.0037 for 2 MAC).

Sevoflurane caused a small but significant hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation, indicating that channels opened at slightly more negative potentials (Fig.2a, b). This suggests that sevoflurane facilitates activation by lowering the voltage threshold for channel opening. Steady-state fast inactivation, also referred to as channel availability (orh∞from the Hodgkin-Huxley model), was tested using a double-pulse protocol (Fig.2a,inset). Sevoflurane significantly shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation by − 6.1 ± 2.7 mV toward more hyperpolarized potentials (Fig.2c, Supplemental TableS1). No such shift was seen in time-control (sham) experiments using external solution without sevoflurane, confirming no significant time-dependent shift inV½−inact(Supplemental Fig. S2c, d; Supplemental Table S3). This indicates that a greater fraction of channels either transitioned into and/or remained in the inactivated state at any given potential, reducing the pool of available channels for subsequent activation. The shift inV½−inactwas concentration-dependent, with the largest effect observed at 2 MAC (Fig.2d). These findings are consistent with sevoflurane stabilization of the inactivated state, thereby limiting Navavailability, while also slightly modulating activation properties.

Sevoflurane also shifted the voltage for half-maximal inactivation (V½−inact) by − 6.1 ± 2.7 mV toward hyperpolarized potentials (V½−inact−44.8 ± 7.0 mV for CTL [white circles]vs. −50.9 ± 7.3 mV for SEVO [orange circles],P< 0.0001,n= 11).d, This shift inV½−inactwas concentration-dependent, with the strongest effect of a − 10.4 ± 5.3 mV shift seen at 2 MAC sevoflurane. All data are mean ± SD; **P< 0.01, ****P< 0.0001vs. control by paired two-tailed Studentt-test.

We measured the effects of sevoflurane on recovery from inactivation using a holding potential of − 120 mV, at which the majority of channels were in a resting, closed state (Fig.3a-c). Sevoflurane (1 MAC; 0.28 mM) significantly slowed the fast component of recovery, as reflected by an increase in the fast time constantτfast, while the slow componentτslowwas unaffected (Supplementary TableS1). This indicates that sevoflurane selectively impairs the rapid recovery of Nav1.3 from fast inactivation, potentially prolonging the refractory period without altering slower recovery kinetics.

Effects of sevoflurane on Nav1.3 recovery from fast inactivation. We used a two-pulse protocol from a holding potential (Vh) of − 120 mV, with two 10 ms test pulses to 0 mV separated by an inter-pulse interval of 1–200 ms (insetin(a)shows stimulation protocol).a, Overlaid macroscopicINatraces for the two pulses with increasing inter-pulse intervals in the absence (CTL,black traces) or presence (SEVO,orange traces) of sevoflurane (1 MAC; 0.28 mM).

Sevoflurane increasedτfastfrom 1.55 ± 0.4 ms to 2.07 ± 0.5 ms (P= 0.0073), thereby slowing recovery from fast inactivation;τslowwas not affected with 55 ± 30 ms for CTL and 40 ± 30 ms for SEVO;P= 0.3789. Data are mean ± SD,n= 7, **P< 0.01vs. control by paired two-tailed Studentt-test.

We compared the effects of sevoflurane on Nav1.3 and Nav1.2 to investigate possible subtype-selective actions on developmentally distinct Navsubtypes. Under control conditions, the voltage-dependent properties of Nav1.3 were more depolarized compared to Nav1.2, with the voltage for half-maximal activation (V½−activ) and inactivation (V½−inact) significantly shifted by + 10 mV (Figs.2and4a-c, Supplemental TableS1,S2). These differences indicate that Nav1.3 channels exhibit depolarized gating, enhancing their likelihood of opening during action potentials and maintaining availability over a wider voltage range, potentially influencing neuronal excitability.

Effects of sevoflurane on Nav1.2 peakINa, steady-state fast inactivation, and recovery from fast inactivation.a, Representative families of whole-cell inward Na+currents evoked by depolarization(inset) from a holding potential (Vh) of − 80 mV in the absence (CTL;left, black traces) or presence of sevoflurane (1 MAC; 0.28 mM) (SEVO;right,orange traces).b,c, Current-voltage relationship of channel activation displayed as normalized conductance (G/Gmax) and inactivation (INa/INamax).

However, sevoflurane shifted the voltage for half-maximal inactivation (V½−inact) by − 6.1 ± 1.8 mV toward hyperpolarized potentials (V½−inact−54.2 ± 5.0 mV for CTL [white diamonds]vs. −60.3 ± 6.2 mV for SEVO [orange diamonds],P< 0.0005,n= 6).d, Effect of sevoflurane on peakINa(stimulation protocol see Fig.1a).

However, with a prepulse toV½−inact, a potential at which half of the channels were in the fast-inactivated state, sevoflurane inhibited peakINa(normalized peakINa0.97 ± 0.05 forV0,P= 0.2238 and 0.73 ± 0.08 forV½−inact,P= 0.0005,n= 6).e,f, Recovery from fast inactivation was tested using the same protocol as in Fig.3b.e, Recovery data (Pulse2/Pulse1) were fitted to a bi-exponential equation and plotted against inter-pulse-interval in the absence (white diamonds,dotted line) or presence (orange diamonds,solid orange line) of sevoflurane.f, Recovery time constantsτfastandτslowin the absence (white diamonds) or presence (orange diamonds) of sevoflurane.

Sevoflurane at a clinically relevant concentration of 1 MAC (0.28 mM) produced similar effects on Nav1.2 (Fig.4a-f) as observed with Nav1.3. Specifically, sevoflurane significantly inhibited peakINaof Nav1.2 when the test pulse followed a prepulse toV½−inact(− 56 ± 7 mV), a potential at which ~ 50% of channels are in a fast-inactivated state, but not with a prepulse toV0(− 120 mV) (Fig.4d). The voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation was shifted by ~ − 6 mV toward more hyperpolarized potentials (Fig.4b, c). Sevoflurane also slowed recovery from fast inactivation, with a significant increase in the fast time constantτfast(Fig.4e, f). Sevoflurane did not significantly alter the activation properties of Nav1.2, highlighting a more pronounced effect on Nav1.3, where the drug modulates both activation and inactivation gating. This action might be particularly relevant in neurons where Nav1.3 is upregulated, such as during development or following injury.

The distinct gating mechanisms of Nav1.3 result inpersistent Na+current(INaP), which enhances repetitive firing and hyperexcitability during neuronal development34,36.INaP allows subthreshold depolarizations to generate APs, but it is unclear whether and how this is modulated by VAs. A largeINaP was generated by Nav1.3 which was significantly inhibited by 1 MAC sevoflurane (Fig.5a-c).INaP generated by Nav1.3 was ~ 6-fold greater than for Nav1.2, which was minimal and not further reduced by sevoflurane (–146 ± 161 pA for Nav1.3vs. − 23 ± 19 pA for Nav1.2; Fig.5d-f). To further validate this persistent current component of Nav1.3, we conducted additional experiments using a prolonged depolarizing step (120 ms), which confirmed the presence of a sustained non-inactivating current throughout the pulse (Supplemental Fig. S3). This current was similarly reduced by sevoflurane, and full block by tetrodotoxin (TTX) confirmed that the residual current was not due to leak or non-specific conductance.

Data are mean ± SD, *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01vs. control by paired two-tailed Studentt-test.

Inward Na+currents during slow depolarizing ramps contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability by promoting repetitive firing. We examined the effects of sevoflurane on ramp-induced currents (INaR) using a depolarizing voltage ramp from − 120 mV to + 40 mV over 800 ms (0.2 mV/ms).INaR was quantified by integrating the inwardINaover the voltage range from the activation threshold to the reversal potential, yielding the total charge transfer. To account for variability in channel expression levels among cells, this charge transfer was normalized to the peakINaelicited by a standard step depolarization, resulting in a normalized charge transfer value (pC/nA). Under control conditions, Nav1.3 mediated a greater normalized charge transfer during the ramp protocol compared to Nav1.2 (9.6 ± 2.0 pC/nA for Nav1.3vs. 3.5 ± 1.0 pC/nA for Nav1.2; data from Fig.6b). Sevoflurane at a clinically relevant concentration of 1 MAC (0.28 mM) significantly reduced the normalized charge transfer associated withINaR in Nav1.3-expressing cells (Fig.6a, b). In contrast, sevoflurane did not alter the normalized charge transfer in Nav1.2 (Fig.6b), suggesting a subtype-specific effect on Na+channel ramp currents.

Sevoflurane selectively inhibits ramp-evoked Na+currents (INaR) in Nav1.3 but not Nav1.2.a, Mean of all ramp currents recorded in response to a slow depolarizing ramp from − 120 mV to + 40 mV over 800 ms (0.2 mV/ms) for Nav1.3 (left panel) or Nav1.2 (right panel).

Sevoflurane reduced charge transfer in Nav1.3 (9.6 ± 5.7 to 5.6 ± 3.1 pC/nA,P= 0.0203,n= 8), but not in Nav1.2 (3.5 ± 2.7 to 1.7 ± 1.3 pC/nA,P= 0.1680n= 7).

The developmentally expressed Na+channel Nav1.3 is sensitive to modulation by the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane. While the effects of volatile anesthetics on Nav1.2 have been characterized previously, their impact on developmentally expressed Nav1.3 were previously unknown. We compared the effects of sevoflurane on the channel gating properties of human Nav1.3 and Nav1.2, the predominant Na+channel subtypes expressed in immature and mature neurons, respectively. Under control conditions, Nav1.3 exhibited gating at more depolarized potentials compared to Nav1.2: both the voltage of half-maximal activation (V½−activ) and inactivation (V½−inact) were ~ 10 mV more positive in Nav1.3. Despite these differences, sevoflurane produced a comparable hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state fast inactivation for both subtypes. The degree of voltage-dependent inhibition of peakINaand the slowing of recovery from fast inactivation were also similar between Nav1.3 and Nav1.2, suggesting that baseline differences in gating do not substantially alter the overall pattern of modulation by sevoflurane.

Persistent Na+current (INaP) can drive intrinsic neuronal hyperexcitability44and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including pacemaking, neuronal injury, chronic pain, and epilepsy. We observed largeINaP in cells expressing Nav1.3, consistent with enhanced excitability of immature neurons. Sevoflurane reducedINaP in Nav1.3 expressing cells, while Nav1.2 had much smaller persistent currents than Nav1.3, and were not further reduced by sevoflurane.

Ramp currents (INaR), which can enhance responses to subthreshold depolarizations by reducing action potential firing threshold45were more pronounced in Nav1.3 expressing cells. This observation is consistent with studies indicating that mutations in Nav1.3 linked to neuronal hyperexcitability increase ramp and persistent currents. Selective inhibition of these currents could mediate developmental stage-specific effects of sevoflurane and possibly other anesthetics on neuronal excitability.

Multiple volatile anesthetics have been shown to inhibit all neuronal Navsubtypes, including Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6, leading to reduced AP amplitude in mature neurons at clinically relevant concentrations11,15,31,33. In addition to shifting the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation and slowing channel recovery, our findings show that sevoflurane also reducesINaP andINaR in Nav1.3-expressing cells, providing a basis for previous observations that volatile anesthetics suppress transient Na+current (INaT) andINaP, thereby reducing hippocampal excitability40. Thus, during brain maturation, multiple Nav1.3 gating mechanisms are likely targeted by volatile anesthetics to inhibit Nav-activated Ca2+-influx and neurotransmitter release that contribute to the neurophysiological actions of anesthetics.

Modulation of neuronal activity by general anesthetics during early development can lead to persistent alterations in neuronal survival and function46,47. The neurotoxic effects of general anesthetics administered at critical periods early in development in the mammalian brain48–50are associated with structural and functional changes, including alterations in dendritic spine dynamics, dendritic arborization, and synaptic protein expression48–50. General anesthetics have selective effects on neurotransmission by depressing excitatory and enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission, which potentially alters the balance of excitotoxicity from glutamatergic transmission in immature neuronal networks51,52. The relative differences in anesthetic effects on excitatory or inhibitory neurons vary between anesthetic agents with synaptic inhibition by modulation of GABAAreceptors essential for intravenous agents such as propofol, while reduction of glutamatergic transmission both presynaptically and postsynaptically contributes to the neurodepressant effects of volatile agents like sevoflurane53–55. These distinctions influence early deleterious actions as administration of drugs that attenuate GABAAreceptor activity or potentiate AMPA signaling during emergence from neonatal general anesthesia can ameliorate neuronal circuit dysfunction and learning deficits under propofol and sevoflurane, respectively46,47. As Nav1.3 is predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons56and drives persistent excitability, our findings suggest a potential role for Nav1.3 in the effects of volatile anesthetic exposure to alter activity of immature, excitatory brain networks. Further investigation is needed to understand compensatory actions on inhibitory networks as well as regulation of Nav1.3 by intravenous agents.

In native neurons, Na+channels are composed of a pore-formingα-subunit and one or more auxiliaryβ-subunits (β1-β4). Auxiliary subunits are critical in regulating channel function, cell surface expression, and downstream signaling. Thus, co-expression withβ-subunit(s) more accurately mimics endogenous neuronal physiology, particularly in heterologous expression systems such as HEK293 cells. Out of the fourβ-subunits, Navβ1 is ubiquitously expressed in the CNS and its structure-function effects are well-characterized compared to other subunits. It has strong modulatory effects on channel properties including voltage dependence, channel kinetics, recovery, and surface expression57–59. Specifically,β1 subunit accelerates both activation and inactivation of Nav1.3 currents, shifts steady-state inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials, and speeds up recovery of Nav1.3 from inactivation59,60. In addition,β1 can enhance membrane trafficking and aid stabilization of Nav1.3 at the cell surface. These properties lead to sharper Nav1.3 Na+currents and supports higher firing frequencies in cells59,60. Although in slightly reduced magnitude, co-expression of theβ1 subunit similarly modulates Nav1.2 compared with Nav1.361,62allowing for reproducible and reliable data collection.

Our baseline Nav1.3 activation properties (V½−activ​) includingINaP are consistent with previous reports45,63–65. However, ourV½−inactvalues were notably more depolarized at ∼–45 mV compared to ∼–70 mV in those studies. Additionally, we observed larger ramp currents and normalized charge transfer in Nav1.3-expressing cells than those reported by Vanoye et al.64,65. These differences might stem from alterations in holding potentials (Vh) (we chose a more physiologicalVhfor certain experiments) or differences in auxiliary subunit expression, as we co-expressed only theβ1-subunit, whereas Vanoye et al. included bothβ1 andβ2. Theβ2 subunit is known to modulate inactivation gating and reduce persistent current amplitude60,66,67which might account for the more depolarized inactivation and enhanced ramp currents observed in our study.

Multiple binding sites have been proposed for volatile anesthetic interactions with Nav68–70; further studies are required to determine whether differences in anesthetic binding to specific sites contribute to these subtype-selective effects of sevoflurane. Recent structure-function studies in bacterial Na+channels has revealed that sevoflurane can displace membrane lipids and bind within a conserved hydrophobic pocket formed between the S1–S4 helices of one subunit and the S5 helix of an adjacent subunit71. Whether a homologous site exists, or is functionally relevant, within the pseudotetrameric domains of mammalian Navremains an important question for future work. Various volatile anesthetics might exhibit different affinities for Navsubtypes72,73with sevoflurane showing stronger interactions with Nav1.3 compared with Nav1.2. Moreover, Navsubtypes not only show cell-type specific expression7but also distinct subcellular and cellular localizations8. Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are enriched in Nav1.1, while excitatory pyramidal neurons express more Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.67,56,74,75. While all Navsubtypes are found at the axon initial segment (AIS) to some degree, Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 are preferentially expressed in the proximal AIS76potentially allowing direct targeting of AP initiation by anesthetics.

The halogenated ethers isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane represent the principal volatile anesthetics employed clinically in modern anesthesia. However, isoflurane and sevoflurane are more commonly used due to their safety profiles and cost-effectiveness. Considerable evidence from our group10,11,33,70,77–80and others81–84show inhibition of neuronal Navby isoflurane with subtype-specificity. For example, Nav1.1 is less sensitive to isoflurane compared to Nav1.2 and 1.6 due to its distinct gating properties33. Although similar, sevoflurane has distinct differences in pharmacological actions and clinical use, gaining broader acceptance and use in modern anesthesia practice. For instance, sevoflurane’s rapid onset and offset leads to faster emergence and recovery and causes less airway irritation than isoflurane85,86. These characteristics make sevoflurane more suitable for various types of surgery, including in pediatric populations with increased Nav1.3 expression84. Although sensitivity to sevoflurane for neuronal Navhas been reported81,84,87, systematic effects of sevoflurane on selective neuronal Navsubtypes or comparative effects between Navsubtypes have not been reported. Here, we report agent-specific differences in efficacy for Na+channel inhibition that could underlie differences in modulation of immature and mature brain networks.

Further studies of the selective effects of sevoflurane on Navsubtypes could lead to the development of more selective and potentially safer anesthetic agents that selectively target specific Navsubtypes based on neuronal stage or neuropathological state by reducing deleterious off target effects or specifically targeting desired effects.

Sevoflurane was obtained from Henry Schein Medical (Melville, NY). HEK293T cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

George Jr. (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) via AddGene (Watertown, MA) and Professor J. A. Kearney (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL), respectively.

Human HEK293T cells (#CRL-3216, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were seeded into 35-mm dishes in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle′s Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air at 37 °C. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with cDNA for hNav1.2 or hNav1.3 (3–4 µg) and human auxiliary hβ1 subunit (0.8–1 µg) using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Additionally, hNav1.3 was cotransfected with 0.8 µg pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) as a reporter to allow identification of EGFP-transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were re-seeded at lower density onto 12-mm glass coverslips 20–24 h post-transfection, and electrophysiological studies were conducted at least 3 h later to allow cells to adhere.

For electrophysiological recordings, coverslips were transferred into a small volume laminar-flow perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and continuously perfused at ~ 2 ml/min with extracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 3.25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM CdCl2, and 20 mM TEA-Cl, adjusted to pH 7.4 (with NaOH) and to 310 mOsm/kg. Na+currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode at room temperature (23–24 °C) using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) with a 5 kHz low-pass filter at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) on a P-1000 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments) and fire-polished before use. Pipette resistance was ~ 1.5–2.5 MΩ when filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 120 mM CsF, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2adjusted to pH 7.3 (with CsOH) and to 312 mOsm/kg (with sucrose). Access resistance (~ 2–4 MΩ) was reduced using 75–85% series resistance correction. To minimize space-clamp and series resistance errors, only cells expressing 1–8 nA peak current were analyzed. Initial whole cell seal resistance was 1–3 GΩ, and recordings were discarded if resistance dropped below 1 GΩ. Liquid–junction potentials were not corrected. Capacitive current transients were electronically canceled with the internal amplifier circuitry, and leak currents were digitally subtracted using the P/4 protocol88Recordings began 5 min after attaining the whole-cell patch configuration to allow equilibration of pipette solution and cytosol. Stimulation protocols were applied in control external solution, and again after a 3-minute superperfusion with external solution containing sevoflurane.

A saturated stock solution of sevoflurane in external solution (~ 5.2 mM at 23 °C) was diluted to the desired final concentration in a gas-tight glass syringe. Sevoflurane solutions were superfused using a pressure-driven microperfusion system (ALA Scientific, Westbury, NY) with a 200 μm diameter perfusion pipette tip positioned ~ 200 μm from the recorded cell. Sevoflurane concentrations sampled at the perfusion pipette tip were determined by gas chromatography using a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) after extraction into octane89. An aqueous sevoflurane solution of 0.28 mM was used as the predicted minimum alveolar concentration (MAC; equivalent to the EC50for immobilization) in humans after temperature adjustment to 24°C30,90. To ensure reproducibility and minimize variability, the time from break-in to initial control recordings was standardized across all experiments, as was the duration of sevoflurane exposure before drug measurements. This protocol was based on previously validated methods shown to maintain stable gating properties over time in similar experimental conditions10,42,70. In addition, sham (time control) recordings were performed in a subset of cells that underwent identical timing and perfusion procedures using external solution without sevoflurane. These experiments confirmed the absence of time-dependent shifts in the voltage-dependence of inactivation or peak current amplitude (see Supplemental Fig. S2 and Supplemental Table S3), thereby supporting the specificity of drug-induced effects reported in the main text.
