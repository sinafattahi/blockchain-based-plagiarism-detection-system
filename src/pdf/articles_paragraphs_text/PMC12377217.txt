To replace sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a potent greenhouse gas with high global warming potential (GWP) and long lifetime, perfluoroisobutyronitrile (C4F7N) has emerged as the next-generation insulating gas to advance the development of the power industry, especially gas-insulated equipment. However, most reported synthesis routes for perfluoroisobutyronitrile require expensive reagents or complex procedures and harsh reaction conditions, which are impractical for scalable production and cost reduction for real applications. Herein, we report a three-step synthetic process from perfluoropropylene to perfluoroisobutyronitrile, involving addition with carbonyl fluoride, nucleophilic substitution with ammonia and dehydration. It achieved a 77% total yield of high-purity perfluoroisobutyronitrile (99.9%), which is significantly higher than that of other synthetic routes. This new synthesis process also offers compelling cost benefits and scalable production, which may promote the broader application of C4F7N.

A novel three-step synthesis route of perfluoroisobutyronitrile was developed for high yield, high purity, and cost efficiency.

To promote the adoption of C4F7N for industry applications, researchers are committed to developing and optimizing different synthesis protocols. To date, four main synthetic routes to perfluoroisobutyronitrile have been reported (Scheme 1). The first method is based on the pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, including diazine, triazine, and nitrogen-containing polycyclic compounds, at high temperatures or under ultraviolet light. Certain fluorinated diaza-cyclohexadiene generate C4F7N under prolonged UV irradiation (254 nm, 240–340 h).10However, due to incomplete diazine fragmentationviaphotopyrolysis, the yield remains low (11–35%).11In contrast, triazine compounds undergo more efficient N–N bond cleavage during pyrolysis, enabling higher selectivity and yield in C4F7N formation.12It was reported that pyrolysis of perfluorotri(isopropyl)-1,2,4-triazine to 560 °C could yield C4F7N with 99.3% efficiency.13,14While alternative triazine and nitrogen-containing precursors can produce C4F7N through thermal or photolytic decomposition,15,16their practical utility remains limited by stringent reaction conditions, costly catalysts, and complex precursor synthesis.

The second route involves the addition reaction of hexafluoropropene and cyanides. Using potassium fluoride (KF) as the catalyst, Oxenrideret al.obtained C4F7N in 31% yieldviaa one-step reaction of hexafluoropropylene with acetonitrile.17Liet al.reported the addition reaction of hexafluoropropylene with cyanogen or cyanide chloride to generate C4F7N with a yield of 64%.18Although the direct introduction of the –CN group makes this route simple, short, and efficient, it largely relies on highly toxic cyanogen or cyanide chloride. Other potential cyanides and cyanating reagents may still pose significant toxicity risks or face challenges in achieving high yields.19,20Therefore, this route fails to meet the requirements for green preparation and is unsuitable for large-scale production.

The third route involves the substitution reaction of iodo-perfluoropropane. Vöhringeret al.found that the reaction of 2-iodo-perfluoropropane and chloroacetonitrile may form C4F7N as a minor by-product, with primary production of 2-chloro-perfluoropropane.21It thus can only have low synthetic efficiency for C4F7N.

It can be seen that these synthetic protocols remain limited by the use of expensive or scarce starting materials, toxic volatile reagents, complex procedures, and low yields, making them unsuitable for scalable C4F7N production. Herein, we developed a novel route for the synthesis of perfluoroisobutyronitrile from starting material hexafluoropropeneviaa three-step process (Scheme 2). Firstly, the addition of hexafluoropropene with carbonyl fluoride in the presence of KF/18-crown-6 complex; then, the nucleophilic substitution of perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride with ammonia. Finally, the dehydrating reaction of heptafluroroisobutyramide in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide. The structural characterization of intermediates and final product was performed by GC-MS,19F-NMR,13C-NMR, and IR spectroscopy. This optimized protocol afforded C4F7N in high yieldviaa relatively short synthetic route.

(Japan). Pure NH3was purchased from Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd (Japan).

The mass spectrometer was a GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu). The column temperature program of GC-MS was as follows: 40 °C for 4 min; 15 °C min−1to 230 °C; hold for 8 min. Both the injection port and the thermal conductivity detector were maintained at 200 °C, and the carrier gas He was introduced at a rate of 10 mL min−1 19F NMR spectra of the intermediates and products during the synthesis were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 (377 MHz) NMR with trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) as internal standards at 25 °C.13C NMR spectra of the intermediates and products during the synthesis were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 (101 MHz) NMR at 25 °C.

0.5 mol potassium fluoride (KF) and 0.1 mol 18-crown-6 were added into an autoclave made of 316 material with a volume of 1 L. After evacuating the system to a vacuum state, 400 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile was transferred into the autoclave. At −100 °C, 1 mol of hexafluoropropylene and 1 mol of carbonyl fluoride were then rapidly introduced into the autoclave. The reaction system was then maintained at 80 °C under constant stirring for 24 h. A 200 mL 316 stainless steel cylinder was evacuated and cooled with liquid nitrogen to condense and collect the gas from the reaction system. The product of perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride was confirmed by19F-NMR,13C-NMR, and IR. The perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride weighed 207.8 g, with a purity of 99.7% and a yield of 95.9%.19F NMR(377 MHz, acetonitrile-d3):δ34.26 (d-heptet,J= 22.24 Hz, 6.03 Hz, –COF, 1F), −73.66 (t,J= 6.41 Hz, –CF3, 6F), −180.38 (d-heptet,J= 21.87 Hz, 7.54 Hz, –CF–COF, 1F) (Fig. S1).13C NMR (101 MHz, acetonitrile-d3):δ148.94 (ddd,J= 374.00 Hz, 53.53 Hz, 27.98 Hz, –COF, 1C), 118.90 (quartet-dd,J= 289.57 Hz, 25.25 Hz, 16.06 Hz, –CF3, 2C), 88.86 (d-heptet,J= 192.71 Hz, 30.01 Hz, –CF–COF, 1C) (Fig. S2).

The autoclave made of 316 material with a volume of 1 L was pumped into a vacuum state. Then under the condition of −100 °C provided by liquid nitrogen, 1 mol perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride and 3.5 mol ammonia were quickly passed into the autoclave one by one. After the addition of raw materials, the reaction system was kept at 15 °C under normal stirring conditions for 20 h. After releasing the gases in the reaction system, the remaining solid was extracted with dichloromethane 200 mL × 3 times to obtain the organic liquid, with the removal of NH4F. The organic liquid was distilled to remove dichloromethane, and heptafluroroisobutyramide was then obtained. The heptafluroroisobutyramide weighed 207.8 g, with a purity of 99.7% and a yield of 89.3%.19F NMR (377 MHz, chloroform-d):δ75.02 (d,J= 7.54 Hz, –CF3, 6F), 180.54 (heptet,J= 6.78 Hz, –CF–CONH2, 1F) (Fig. S3).13C NMR (101 MHz, chloroform-d):δ159.74 (d,J= 20.40 Hz, –CONH2, 1C), 118.82 (quartet-dd,J= 287.85 Hz, 26.66 Hz, 1.62 Hz, –CF3, 2C), 88.38 (d-heptet,J= 219.47 Hz, 32.93 Hz, –CF–CONH2, 1C) (Fig. S4).

0.1 mol heptafluroroisobutyramide and 0.5 mol P2O5were added into an autoclave made of 316 material with a volume of 1 L and pumped into a vacuum state. To prevent direct contact with water, which could trigger a violent exothermic reaction forming phosphoric acid, P2O5was gradually added to the reaction vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere within a glovebox. After the addition of raw materials, the reaction system was kept at 180 °C under stirring for 16 h. After the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, a cylinder (200 mL 316 material) was firstly vacuumed by pump, then frozen by liquid nitrogen, and collected the gas from the reaction system. It was proved to be perfluorobutyronitrile by19F-NMR,13C-NMR, IR, and GC-MS. The perfluorobutyronitrile weighed 17.6 g, with a purity of 99.9% and a yield is 90.0%.19F NMR(377 MHz, acetone-d6):δ75.91 (d,J= 10.56 Hz, –CF3, 6F), 176.99 (heptet,J= 9.98 Hz, –CF–CN, 1F) (Fig. S5).13C NMR (101 MHz, acetone-d6):δ117.66 (quartet-d,J= 289.97 Hz, 27.27 Hz, –CF3, 2C), 106.56 (d,J= 30.10 Hz, –CN, 1C), 82.67 (d-heptet,J= 220.08 Hz, 38.38 Hz, –CF–CN, 1C) (Fig. S6).

To address the limitations of existing C4F7N synthesis methods, we selected hexafluoropropylene as a safer and more readily available starting material. The initial step is the reaction of hexafluoropropene with carbonyl fluoride to produce perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride in acetonitrile. Since the key precursor carbonyl fluoride has a boiling point of 190 K (−83 °C), a cryogenic environment must be maintained to ensure sufficient liquefaction and precise dosing. The ethanol-liquid nitrogen cooling system can achieve temperatures as low as −116 °C, which should meet the experimental requirements. Hexafluoropropylene and carbonyl fluoride were mixed at −100 °C and then heated to 80 °C with stirring for 24 h. The KF/18-crown-6 complex was used as a catalyst to enhance the substitution. 18-crown-6 has a higher selectivity for potassium ion (K+) over other alkali metal cations.26The stable complex of 18-crown-6 with K+could increase the solubility of KF in organic solvents.27,28Experimental measurements revealed that upon the addition of 18-crown-6, the solubility of KF in acetonitrile increased more than 30 times at 25 °C.29In this reaction, the fluoride anion (F−) of KF reacts with hexafluoropropylene to form a fluorocarbon anion intermediate, which subsequently reacts with carbonyl fluoride to yield perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride (Scheme 3). The complexation could reduce electrostatic K+–F−interactions, thereby enhancing fluoride's nucleophilicity and accelerating the reaction rate.30Under reacting at 80 °C for 24 h, the production of perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride from the reaction of hexafluoropropylene and carbonyl fluoride was shown a high yield of 95.9% with a purity of 99.7% according to the analysis by IR,19F-NMR and13C-NMR. While for the process without the addition of 18-crown-6, the yield of perfluoroisobutyl fluoride was only 80%.22These results confirmed the critical role of 18-crown-6 in enhancing the reaction yield of the first step.

The second step is the formation of heptafluroroisobutyramide from perfluoroisobutyl fluoride. The reaction was conducted under both solvent-free and catalyst-free conditions. Perfluoroisobutyl fluoride (b. p. 7–9 °C) and ammonia were first mixed at −100 °C. The reaction was conducted using pure liquid ammonia. Since the product is hydrolytically unstable and decomposes upon exposure to water, this process must strictly exclude all water. Although ammonia is an irritant reagent, it is far less toxic and does not inhibit cellular respiration. As a widely employed reagent in industrial processes, ammonia may offer practical advantages for this application.

The mixture gradually warmed to 15 °C and stirred for 20 h. Under these conditions, the reaction proceeds efficiently in the gas phase due to the volatility of perfluoroisobutyl fluoride, ensuring homogeneous mixing of reactants. The reaction product, heptafluoroisobutyramide, was isolated by dichloromethane extraction. Unlike conventional methanol-mediated reactions that generate HF as a byproduct, this process can eliminate this hazardous byproduct. Any HF byproduct will immediately react with excess ammonia to form solid NH4F, enabling facile separation from the reaction mixture. Based on the analysis, it can achieve the production of heptafluoroacetamide with high yield (89.7%) and purity (99.7%).

The reaction presumably proceedsviaa mechanism analogous to ammonia's nucleophilic attack on acyl chlorides, involving sequential addition–elimination steps (Scheme 4).31,32It was proposed that carbon–halogen bond heterolysis may generate a carbocation and a halogen anion with a high activation energy barrier.33Ammonia may act as both nitrogen nucleophile and catalyst for the reaction. In the process, the lone pair on the nitrogen atom of ammonia attacks the carbonyl with the fairly positive carbon in perfluoroisobutyl fluoride (the addition stage). In perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride, C-1 is the standard nucleophilic site, bearing a significant positive charge and thus highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack as the primary reactive center. C-2 carries a partial positive charge due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group, enabling deprotonation by strong bases—though this occurs only under specific conditions. C-3 exhibits a relatively balanced charge distribution with minimal charge polarization, rendering it virtually unreactive toward nucleophilic substitution. Notably, this experiment observed no NH3attack at C-2, likely attributable to the insufficiently strong basicity of ammonia. Subsequently, the carbonyl double bond will reform and eliminate a fluoride ion, which is followed by deprotonation of the N–H bond (the elimination stage). In polar solvents, coordination and induction effects may disperse the positive charge of the carbocation and diminish its electrophilic reactivity.34The solvent's cage effect could also increase the activation energy of the reaction to some extent.35Therefore, this neat reaction for heptafluroroisobutyramide demonstrates enhanced reaction efficiency and also minimizes safety concerns from HF release.

The final step comprises the dehydration of heptafluroroisobutyramide. Dehydration is one of the fundamental routes to convert primary amides to nitriles.36,37The combination of low-cost dehydrates and mild reaction conditions render this direct synthesis particularly appealing for sustainable scale-up, and green chemistry principles. Various dehydration systems have been developed, including NaBH4, lithium hydride, PdCl2, phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5), TiCl4, AlCl3/NaI, (COCl)2/Et3N/Ph3PO, and silanes/transition metal catalysts,etc.38In this process, we choose P2O5as the dehydrating agent. In certain transformations, P2O5exhibits insufficient dehydrating activity, necessitating either modified P2O5composites or metal-catalyzed systems to achieve satisfactory reaction rates and yields.39–41However, as we carry out the dehydration of heptafluroroisobutyramide in a non-solvent condition, we think that P2O5alone should be sufficient to ensure the formation of C4F7N. The strong hygroscopic nature of P2O5may also help remove water from the reaction, potentially preventing the formation of side products. In this step, heptafluoroisobutyramide and P2O5were directly mixed and heated to 180 °C with stirring for 16 h. The gas product of C4F7N was collected after freezing the reaction mixture.

To determine the optimal amount of P2O5for this reaction, we evaluated the catalytic efficiency across a range of P2O5loadings (1–5 equivalents). The results demonstrated that increasing the P2O5loading significantly improves the yield of C4F7N, with product purity exceeding 99% under all conditions (Table S1). At 5 equivalents of P2O5, a maximum yield of 90% with 99.9% purity could be achieved. It should be mentioned that since the reaction system is strictly anhydrous (all products are hydrolytically unstable and decompose upon exposure to water), P2O5as a catalyst can be reused or maintained effectively for extended periods. As a result, its use may not significantly increase costs or contribute to high waste accumulation.

In this three-step route, the total yield of C4F7N was calculated to be 77.1%. Compared to other reported methods, our route offers significant advantages: (1) inexpensive and readily available raw materials, (2) shorter synthetic sequence, (3) easy reaction control, and (4) high product quality (yield and purity). This may also greatly reduce the production costs. It may enable scalable production of C4F7N for industry applications.

In conclusion, we have developed an efficient three-step synthetic route to C4F7N from readily available hexafluoropropylene. KF/18-crown-6 complex promotes the formation of perfluoroisobutyryl fluoride in the first step. The solvent-free neat reaction with ammonia in the second step enables rapid and quantitative conversion of heptafluoroisobutyramide while preventing the formation of hazardous HF by-products. In the final step, P2O5effectively minimized by-product formation while facilitating straightforward isolation of the target product. This synthetic route offers multiple advantages, including high yield, operational simplicity, and cost efficiency. It demonstrates great potential for scalable production of C4F7N, which may also enable wider adoption of C4F7N in the sustainable energy industry.
