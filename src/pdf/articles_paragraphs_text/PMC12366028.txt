Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with cervical cancer in Ghana, screening uptake remains alarmingly low. Rural–urban disparities exist in screening uptake among women aged 30–49 years, a priority group for cervical cancer screening according to the World Health Organisation guidelines. This study examined rural–urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake and its predictors among women aged 30–49 years.

We analysed secondary data from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, comprising 7,105 women aged 30–49 years. A multivariate non-linear decomposition analysis was conducted to examine factors explaining rural–urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake. Furthermore, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of screening uptake.

Cervical cancer screening uptake was higher among urban women (9.66%) [n= 335/3,471; 95% CI: 8.15–11.41] than rural women (4.12%) [n= 150/3,634; 95% CI: 3.30–5.14]. Approximately 92% of the rural–urban disparity in cervical cancer screening uptake was attributable to differences in education, household wealth and media exposure. Among rural women, higher cervical cancer screening uptake was associated with older age (45–49 years; AOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.20–3.70), higher educational attainment (AOR = 11.78; 95% CI: 6.38–21.78), and frequent health facility visits (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.21–3.98). Among urban women, cervical cancer screening uptake was significantly associated with higher educational attainment (AOR = 3.03; 95% CI: 1.48–6.23) and being in the highest wealth index (AOR = 5.47; 95% CI: 1.34–22.33).

Cervical cancer screening uptake remains significantly lower among rural women compared to urban women in Ghana. The rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake were largely due to differences in socio-demographic, socio-economic and behavioural characteristics. Key predictors of cervical cancer screening uptake included older age, higher education levels, more frequent visits to health facilities, and belonging to wealthier households. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, such as mobile screening units, community-based education, enhanced media campaigns, and subsidising the cost of cervical cancer screening, to address access barriers and improve equitable uptake across rural and urban settings.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer among women worldwide, with approximately 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths reported in 2022 [1]. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are the most affected by the disease and account for 90% of global cervical cancer deaths [2]. Across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), cervical cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women [3]. This is primarily due to limited access to cervical cancer screening services [4]. Specifically in Ghana, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women, with 2,797 new cases and 1,699 deaths reported annually [5]. In 2022, the age-standardised incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer in Ghana were 27.0 and 16.9 per 100,000 people, respectively [6]. It is projected that by 2030, cervical cancer will cause approximately 443,000 deaths, with SSA accounting for 90% of the global mortality [7,8]. Despite the WHO’s global strategy to accelerate the elimination of the disease, it remained a major global health issue due to inequities in access to prevention, screening, and treatment services [9].

The uptake of cervical cancer screening in SSA remains low, with one study reporting a regional average of 12.87% [10]. However, screening rates vary across countries; for instance, 72% of women in Botswana have undergone cervical cancer screening via Pap smear [11], while in Uganda, the reported uptake stands at 20.6% [12]. While in Ghana, only 8.3% of women have ever had a pelvic examination, and 2.4% have undergone a Pap smear test [13]. Factors such as age, lack of awareness, low educational level, low income and rural residence have been associated with the low cervical cancer screening uptake in Ghana [14,15].

Cervical cancer remains a critical public health challenge in LMICs, such as Ghana [16]. The World Health Organisation (WHO), in its efforts to eliminate cervical cancer, recommends prioritising cervical cancer screening for women, particularly those aged 30 years and older [1]. However, recent evidence indicates significant rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake among women in this age group [17,18]. A pooled secondary data analysis from four African countries revealed that cervical cancer screening uptake was higher among urban women aged 30–49 years (29.7%) compared to rural women of the same age group (17.3%) [19]. Similarly, a recent study in Ghana reported a higher cervical cancer screening prevalence among urban women aged 30–49 years (9.65%) compared to their rural counterparts (4.12%) [18].

While recent studies highlight rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake among women aged 30–49 [17–19], the underlying factors driving these disparities remain underexplored in the literature. Therefore, this study examined the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake and its predictors among women aged 30–49 years in Ghana. By providing insights into the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake, this research aims to bridge a crucial gap in the literature and to inform geographically targeted public health strategies. Ultimately, this will support the WHO’s goal of eliminating cervical cancer by ensuring that all countries achieve a 70% uptake in cervical cancer screening [20].

We analysed data from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS), specifically from the individual recode (IR) file. The GDHS is a nationally representative survey used to estimate demographic and health indicators. The GDHS is part of the global Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, a broader initiative conducted in over 85 LMICs to collect nationally representative data on population health [21].

The 2022 GDHS employed a cross-sectional study design, collecting data at a single point in time. This design is appropriate for estimating population-level indicators and for examining associations between sociodemographic characteristics and health outcomes. Given the survey’s broad coverage and standardised methodology, it is particularly well-suited for analysing disparities in health service utilisation, including cervical cancer screening.

A structured two-stage sampling strategy was then employed in the sample selection. This resulted in a stratified representative sample of 18,450 households across 618 clusters. This approach ensured comprehensive national representation, encompassing both urban and rural areas within each of Ghana’s 16 regions. In the first stage, 618 target clusters were selected using a probability proportional to size method, accounting for urban-rural variations within each region. An equal probability systematic random sampling technique was then applied to determine the required number of clusters in both urban and rural areas [21].

A two-stage stratified sampling strategy was employed to select a nationally representative sample of 18,450 households across 618 clusters, ensuring representation across urban and rural areas in all 16 administrative regions of Ghana. In the first stage, 618 clusters (enumeration areas) were selected using a probability proportional to size method, stratified by urban-rural location and region [21]. In the second stage, an updated household listing and mapping exercise was conducted within each selected cluster, from which 30 households were randomly selected using systematic sampling [21].

Data was collected from around 18,540 households across all 16 regions of Ghana. A total of 15,014 women aged 15–49 years were interviewed. For this study, we focused on a weighted analytic sample of 7,105 women aged 30–49 years. Our analysis was restricted to women aged 30 to 49 years for two main reasons. First, the 2022 GDHS collected cervical cancer screening data only for women aged 15–49 years. Second, the World Health Organisation recommends prioritising routine cervical cancer screening for women aged 30 years and above, given their higher risk of cervical cancer development. This age group, therefore, represents the most policy-relevant and data-available population for examining screening disparities in the Ghanaian context.

Approval for access and use of the dataset was obtained from ICF International via the DHS website (http://www.dhsprogram.com). The study was conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline [22].

The outcome variable in this study was cervical cancer screening uptake. This was captured in the dataset as“ever tested for cervical cancer by a health care provider”.The response options provided were “yes”, “no” and “don’t know”. We dropped the observations for those who responded “don’t know”. Those who responded “yes” were coded as “1” and those who responded “no” were coded as “0”.

In this study, place of residence was used as an equity stratifier to examine disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake among women. This approach enabled the assessment of how geographical location, typically categorised as urban or rural, influenced the uptake of cervical cancer screening services among this population. This approach has been used in a previous study to assess rural-urban disparity in cervical cancer screening uptake [17].

Informed by existing literature and the availability of variables in the dataset [14,18,23,24]. The study included 12 covariates to examine their association with the uptake of cervical cancer screening. These variables included women’s age, marital status, educational level, current working status, household wealth index, place of residence, religion, region, times visited a health facility in the past 6 months, visited a health facility in the past 12 months, distance to health facility, has a valid health insurance and media exposure. Table1presents the study variables and their categories.

All analyses were carried out in Stata software version 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Percentages with confidence intervals (CIs) were used to summarise the uptake of cervical cancer screening. The data were weighted to ensure an accurate representation of the study population and to adjust for variations in sample selection probability. Associations between independent and outcome variables by place of residence were examined using the Chi-square test.

We employed a multivariate non-linear decomposition analysis to examine the urban-rural disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake. The multivariate non-linear decomposition analysis is widely used in social research to break down group differences in average predictions derived from multivariate models [25]. It leverages regression model outputs to separate the overall group difference in a statistic, such as a mean or proportion, into two key components: one attributed to compositional differences between groups (i.e., variations in characteristics or endowments) and another attributed to differences in the effects of these characteristics [25]. We utilized this approach to evaluate the relative contribution of each covariate to the urban-rural disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake among women.

Furthermore, bivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors significantly associated with cervical cancer screening uptake among urban and rural women. Independent variables that were significant in the bivariate logistic regression (p< 0.05) were included in a multivariable logistic regression to assess their association with cervical cancer screening uptake. This was presented as Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR). All estimates were adjusted for any potential sampling bias by applying the individual sampling weight variable (v005). Due to the complex nature of the DHS survey, we used the survey command (svyset) in Stata to account for clustering effects and sample weight effects. Statistical significance was set at a 5% level (p< 0.05) for all analyses.

To ensure the reliability of our findings, we assessed multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF). The results indicated no collinearity between the variables, with a mean VIF of 1.31, a minimum VIF of 1.03, and a maximum VIF of 2.39 (see Additional File 1).

Ethical approval was not required for this study as it utilised publicly available secondary data. Detailed information on the DHS dataset and its ethical guidelines can be accessed athttp://goo.gl/ny8T6X.

Table1presents the background characteristics of the respondents. Among the 7,105 women aged 30–49 years included in the analysis, 4,056 (57.09%) resided in urban areas, and 3,049 (42.91%) in rural areas. Only 517 (7.28%) of respondents reported having ever been tested for cervical cancer by a healthcare provider, as shown in Fig.1. Most respondents (47.45%) were aged 30–34 years, with 3,372 (47.45%) having secondary education. A total of 6,393 (89.98%) were currently working, 2,948 (41.49%) lived in coastal regions, 1,732 (24.38%) belonged to the richest wealth index, 4,332 (60.96%) were married, and 5,459 (76.84%) identified as Christians.

Regarding health access, 6,465 (90.99%) of respondents had health insurance, 5,476 (77.07%) perceived distance to health facilities as not a big problem, 3,981 (56.03%) had visited a health facility in the past 12 months, and 1,533 (67.20%) had visited a health facility 1–2 times in the past 6 months. In terms of media exposure, 5,147 (72.45%) of respondents reported exposure to media.

Table2presents the distribution of cervical cancer screening uptake across the explanatory variables. The prevalence of cervical cancer screening uptake was higher in urban women (9.66%) [n= 335/3,471; 95% CI: 8.15–11.41] than in rural women (4.12%) [n= 150/3,634; 95% CI: 3.30–5.14].

In rural areas, screening uptake was highest among women aged 45–49 years (5.60%,n= 38), those with higher education (19.65%,n= 33), those in the richest wealth index (11.08%,n= 30), and those who visited a health facility three to five times in the past six months (10.89%, n = 30). Higher uptake was also observed among those exposed to media (5.38%,n= 120) and those with health insurance (4.39%,n= 143).

Among urban women, the highest screening prevalence was observed among those aged 45–49 years (10.76%,n= 66), those with higher education (22.58%,n= 129), those in the richest wealth index (14.75%,n= 189), and those who visited a health facility three to five times (15.22%,n= 44). Women exposed to media (10.69%,n= 300) and those with health insurance (10.05%,n= 321) also had higher screening uptake.

Overall, cervical cancer screening uptake tended to increase with age, education, wealth, frequency of health facility visits, and media exposure across both settings.

Table3presents a non-linear multivariate decomposition analysis of rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake. We observed that approximately 92% of the rural-urban disparity in cervical cancer screening uptake was due to differences in educational level, wealth index, and media exposure. Therefore, equalizing these factors would significantly reduce the disparity. However, it would not eliminate it, as 7.56% of the disparity remains unexplained.

Table4presents the predictors of cervical cancer screening uptake among rural and urban women aged 30–49 in Ghana. Among rural women, the odds of cervical cancer screening uptake were significantly higher among those aged 45–49 years compared to those aged 30–34 years (AOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.20–3.70). Women with higher education had significantly greater odds of undergoing cervical cancer screening compared to those with no formal education (AOR = 5.05; 95% CI: 2.16–11.79). Furthermore, those who visited a health facility 3–5 times in the past six months had twice the odds of cervical cancer screening uptake compared to those who did not visit any facility during the same period (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.21–3.98).

Among urban women, cervical cancer screening uptake was significantly associated with higher educational attainment, with women who had higher education showing greater odds compared to those with no education (AOR = 3.03; 95% CI: 1.48–6.23). Moreover, women in the highest wealth index had significantly higher odds of screening uptake than those in the lowest wealth index (AOR = 5.47; 95% CI: 1.34–22.33).

The study examined the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake and its associated factors among women aged 30-49 in Ghana. Notably, cervical cancer screening uptake was higher among urban women (9.66%) than rural women (4.12%). This is consistent with previous studies [17,18,26], showing that geographical differences hinder access to cervical cancer screening. This is partly due to limited access to healthcare services, poor transportation systems and poor health literacy among rural residents [27]. Our study suggests that implementing health interventions, such as establishing mobile clinics, providing community-based education campaigns, facilitating community self-sampling of HPV tests, and deploying more community health workers to hard-to-reach areas, could help bridge this gap. These strategies would not only enhance access to screening services but also improve awareness and early detection, ultimately reducing the burden of cervical cancer among women [28].

We found that the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake were due to differences in educational level, wealth index, and media exposure. Therefore, levelling these factors could significantly reduce the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake among women aged 30-49. Our findings support the need for continuous efforts to reduce the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake. Reducing the rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening could contribute to the attainment of WHO’s goal of ensuring that all countries achieve 70% cervical cancer screening uptake [29].

The factors significantly associated with cervical cancer screening uptake among rural women were age, educational level, and the number of visits to health facilities in the past 6 months. Rural women aged 45-49 years had higher odds of cervical cancer screening uptake than women aged 30-34. This corroborates with previous studies that the prevalence of cervical cancer screening uptake increases with age [18,30–32]. This may be partly attributed to the fact that awareness programs regarding cervical cancer screening and its benefits are often directed toward older women. In addition, older women are more likely to have had repeated contact with reproductive health services such as family planning, antenatal care, and abortion care, which can increase their exposure to health education and create more opportunities for screening. As a result, older women are more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening. This public health approach is reasonable, as existing research has shown that older women are at an increased risk of cervical cancer compared to younger women [33]. Therefore, healthcare providers are more likely to recommend cervical cancer screening to older women than to younger women. Our findings also showed that rural women with higher education had higher odds of cervical cancer screening uptake than those with no formal education. This aligns with previous studies showing that having higher education increases the odds of cervical cancer screening uptake [34,35]. Higher education enhances knowledge, creates awareness, and promotes informed decision-making, which can help alter negative health-seeking behaviour [36]. Women with higher education may have higher levels of health literacy and the ability to comprehend cervical cancer prevention messages, thereby increasing their odds of cervical cancer screening uptake. Conversely, those with no formal education may have inadequate health literacy and the ability to comprehend cervical cancer prevention messages, thereby hindering them from getting screened. Furthermore, the odds of cervical cancer screening uptake were found to be higher among rural women who visited health facilities 3-5 times in the past 6 months. This finding aligns with an Ethiopian study, which highlighted that the frequency of health facility visits was associated with the utilization of cervical cancer screening services [37]. The plausible explanation for this is that women who frequently engage with healthcare providers are more likely to receive information and counselling about cervical cancer, which in turn increases their odds of cervical cancer screening uptake. This highlights the need for continued cervical cancer awareness campaigns at the health facility and community levels. In urban women, cervical cancer screening uptake was associated with educational level and wealth index. Urban women with higher education had higher odds of cervical cancer screening uptake compared to those with no formal education. Our findings corroborate previous studies suggesting that higher educational attainment is positively associated with uptake of cervical cancer screening [34,38]. Therefore, educational inequalities should be considered during decision-making processes to enhance the uptake of cervical cancer screening. Additionally, urban women in the richest wealth index had higher odds of cervical cancer screening compared to those in the lowest wealth index. This finding was consistent with previous studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa [12,24,39]. The high odds of cervical cancer screening uptake among women in the richest wealth index observed in our study may be attributed to their financial capacity to afford screening services, where health insurance is limited [40]. Our finding is not surprising given that Ghana currently has no national cervical cancer screening program, and most women must rely on out-of-pocket payments to access screening services [41].

However, while our findings align with several studies that show higher screening uptake among urban women, older women, and those with higher education and wealth status, other studies have reported contrasting patterns. A study done in Tanzania found no significant differences in screening uptake between rural and urban women, attributing this to targeted government outreach services and mobile clinics in rural areas that improved access to screening in underserved populations [36]. Another study among women in Ethiopia and Malawi reported a contradictory finding, where they found that sociocultural factors and local service availability may have a greater influence on the uptake of cervical cancer screening services than the wealth index of an individual [39]. Additionally, a multilevel study conducted in Kenya reported no consistent association between higher education and screening uptake, suggesting that access to health services and community-level factors may mediate the influence of educational attainment. These inconsistencies highlight the contextual and structural variations in health system organisation, community health interventions, and cultural perceptions that may influence screening behaviours across settings.

Our study highlights the importance of reducing financial and structural barriers to cervical cancer screening in both rural and urban settings. This highlights the necessity for a multifaceted approach that encompasses community-based education, enhanced service delivery, and targeted outreach to underserved populations. Addressing these broader factors could contribute to reducing the observed socioeconomic and rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake. We suggest the need for culturally relevant cervical cancer education materials, including printed posters, audio messages, and infographics, specifically tailored for women with no formal education. Policymakers should consider disseminating cervical cancer awareness messages in local languages through various media platforms to enhance awareness and increase the uptake of cervical cancer screening in rural areas.

This study has several strengths. Firstly, the use of a nationally representative sample enhances the generalizability of our findings to women aged 30–49 years in Ghana. Secondly, the rigorous data collection and analysis protocols employed by the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data, reducing the risk of measurement bias. Moreover, the application of a multivariate non-linear decomposition analysis provides a robust assessment of the factors contributing to rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake, offering valuable insights for targeted public health interventions.

Despite these strengths, the study has some limitations. Firstly, the DHS relied on self-reported data on cervical cancer screening uptake, and this introduces potential recall bias, as participants may not accurately remember their cervical cancer screening history. Secondly, social desirability bias may have influenced responses, potentially leading to overreporting of cervical cancer screening uptake. Moreover, the cross-sectional design of the GDHS limits our ability to establish causal relationships between the identified predictors and cervical cancer screening uptake. Future research employing longitudinal designs could provide deeper insights into the temporal dynamics of screening behaviours. Lastly, our analysis was restricted to women aged 30 to 49 years because the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) collects data only on women of reproductive age, defined as 15 to 49 years. As a result, our findings can only be generalised to women within the 30 to 49-year age group.

This study reveals a substantial disparity in cervical cancer screening uptake between rural and urban women in Ghana. Screening prevalence was higher among urban women (9.66%) compared to rural women (4.12%). The rural-urban disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake are largely attributed to differences in educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and media exposure. Women with lower education levels and those in the poorest wealth index are less likely to undergo cervical cancer screening. To address these inequities, it is essential to reduce both financial and structural barriers to cervical cancer screening across rural and urban settings. Targeted public health interventions should focus on expanding community-based education programs to raise awareness, improving the availability and accessibility of screening services, and providing subsidised cervical cancer screening, particularly for underserved populations.

Addressing these disparities is essential for accelerating progress toward the World Health Organisation’s global cervical cancer elimination strategy and for improving health outcomes among women across Ghana. Future studies should consider exploring cervical cancer screening uptake among women aged 50 years and above.
