Potato wild relatives (SolanumsectionPetota) are a source of genetic diversity for climate‐smart improvement of modern cultivars (Solanum tuberosum). The allotetraploidSolanum acauleBitter. has been previously used to introgress frost tolerance into potato cultivars such as Yukon Gold and Viking. The current study presents the subgenomes ofS. acaule. In a phylogenetic context, the placement of the individual subgenomes shows thatSolanum megistacrolobum(Clade 4) is the progenitor species ofS. acaulesubgenome 2, while the progenitor species of subgenome 1 (mapping to Clade 3) is still unknown and may be extinct. The genome assembly is 1.34 Gb in 24 chromosomes with an N50 of 56.2 Mb, making the theoretical tetraploidS. acaulegenome 2.68 Gb. The C‐repeat binding factor (CBF) cold response genes were identified in the subgenomes, and in a freeze‐challenged transcriptome analysis ofS. acaulecompared with autotetraploidS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’,CBF1was induced in both species, whileCBF4(subgenome 2) was induced only inS. acaule. A general subgenome expression bias was not detected in a set of homoeologous genes, though the subgenomes diverged in the number of differentially expressed genes and their functional roles.

Wild potato relatives are an important source of genetic material for developing modern climate‐smart potato cultivars, which need to be “en garde” for the increasing frequencies of dramatic weather events such as sudden frosts and droughts (Tai et al.,2025). Over 100 wild potato species are recognized in theSolanumsectionPetota(tuber‐bearing members of theSolanumgenus), and genome data for many of them have been released (e.g., Achakkagari et al.,2024; Aversano et al.,2015; Hardigan et al.,2017; Hosaka et al.,2022; Kyriakidou, Achakkagari et al.,2020; Kyriakidou, Anglin et al.,2020; Leisner et al.,2018; Y. Li et al.,2018; D. Tang et al.,2022), as have larger compilations such as theSolanumsectionPetotasuper pangenome (Bozan et al.,2023). Accessions representing breeding hybrids betweenSolanum tuberosumand wild relatives have also been published (e.g., Achakkagari et al.,2024,2022). While the majority of modern potato cultivars are autotetraploid and the majority of wild relatives are diploid, the allopolyploid potato species, such asSolanum acauleandSolanum stoloniferum(both allotetraploid),Solanum demissumandSolanum albicans(both hexaploid),Solanum juzepzukii(triploid), andSolanum curtilobum(pentaploid), have long fascinated potato researchers.

One of the most extreme of the allopolyploid species is the allotetraploidS. acaule(2n= 4x= 48) (Bitter G.1912; Dvorak,1983; Hawkes,1990; Ochoa,2004), which grows at the highest altitudes (from 2400 to 4700 m), tolerates some of the lowest temperatures (Vega & Bamberg,1995), and has the widest geographical spread of all potato polyploids, from Peru to Argentina (Ochoa,2004).Solanum acaulehas a typical cold‐tolerant growth habit—low to the ground, rosette shaped (acaulemeans “stemless”), and sports plenty of trichomes. Early studies showed that it can tolerate frosts down to −5.5°C or −6.5°C (P. H. Li,1977; Sukumaran & Weiser,1972). Several studies were carried out onS. acaulecold resistance genes (Karlsson & Palta,1999; F. Li, Xu, et al.,2014), and one transcriptome study found that putrescine, saccharides, amino acids, and other metabolites accumulated after exposure to −1°C for 12 h (Kou et al.,2018). L. Chen et al. (2022) identified SaCBL1‐like (where CBL is calcineurin B‐like) as playing a vital role in conferring freezing tolerance in potato, and a potential basis for a targeted potato breeding for frost‐hardiness, and Aversano et al. (2015) identified several important genes.

Solanum acaulehas long been used in potato breeding programs primarily due to its frost tolerance, but also because of its resistance to cyst and root knot nematodes and to several viruses including potato virus X, potato virus Y, and potato leafroll virus (Ross,1986). A frost‐resistant variety, Alaska Frostless, resulting from the progeny of crosses involvingS. acaule, was described by Dearborn (1969), and at least 20 additional potato cultivars, including Viking and Yukon Gold, haveS. acaulein their pedigree (Love,1999). The high‐altitude habitat ofS. acaulerarely harbors otherSolanumspecies to naturally intercross withS. acaule(Hawkes,1990; Hosaka & Spooner,1992). It is strongly self‐compatible, has disomic inheritance, and does not hybridize with autotetraploids due to mismatched endosperm balance number (EBN, EBN 2 inS. acauleand 4 inS. tuberosum), leading to a breakdown in the endosperm. Hybridization with diploids does occur with diploids of the same EBN number (2), but it results in sterile triploids such as the landraceS. juzepzukii(Hawkes,1962; Schmiediche et al.,1980,1982), so gene flow intoS. acauleis limited. Ploidy manipulations and bridge strategies are therefore needed for breedingS. acaulesuccessfully with autotetraploids. Further, identification of nuclear and cytoplasm genome composition is required after hybrids are produced via bridge crossing or somatic hybridization (Park,2021).

TheSolanumsectionPetotais known from several phylogenetic studies to be divided into several clades. Using orthologs of nuclear genes, plastid genomes, genome‐wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, and whole‐genome presence/absence variation, three main clades were recovered and are referred to as Clade 1+2, Clade 3, and Clade 4 (Bozan et al.,2023; Huang et al.,2019; Y. Li et al.,2018; Spooner et al.,2008; Yan et al.,2023). Clade 1+2 contain North and Central American diploid species, while Clade 3 contains diploids from southern Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and Clade 4, which containsS. tuberosumand other cultivated species, is further divided into Clade 4 North (species from Peru) and Clade 4 South (species from Bolivia and south) (Y. Li et al.,2018; Spooner et al.,2018).

Studies on the origins of genomes in sectionPetotareference species groupings based on the taxonomy from Hawkes (Hawkes,1958,1962,1990) as well as Spooner (Spooner et al.,2014,2008). Observation of bivalents during meiosis in interspecies hybrids was used to assign five genome groups: A, B, C, D, and P (Matsubayashi,1991). The A genome group covered all South American diploids and some polyploids, and the B, C, D, and P genome groups did not include diploids.S. acaulewas found to be an allotetraploid with two sets of variant A genomes (Matsubayashi,1991). Analysis using genetic markers and genomic in situ hybridization supported the A genome assignment (Pendinen et al.,2012; Rodriguez & Spooner,2009; Spooner et al.,2008). However, there are many species with A genomes and the species origin of theS. acaulegenomes remained unknown. Plastid genome sequencing ofS. acauledemonstrated grouping in Clade 4 (Park,2021; Yan et al.,2023), though that only indicates the maternal origin. By using six nuclear DNA orthologues as markers, Cai et al. (2012) showed thatS. acaulecarries alleles that match homologues in bothPetotaClade 3 and 4 species, though no conclusive progenitors were identified.

In the present study, we examine a clone ofS. acaule, AA9, which was propagated from a single seed sourced from wild seed collected in Ancash, Peru (PI 498202). The collection site was Puca Chaca, between Tarica and Sihuas, at 4100 m. The high elevation is typical ofS. acaulehabitats. We have sequenced and assembled the nuclear subgenomes ofS. acauleand placed them in a phylogeny consisting of a larger range ofSolanumsectionPetotagenomes. The cladistic groupings inferred from the phylogeny were used to understand the origins of subgenomes and progenitors ofS. acaule. Furthermore, we have explored theS. acaulecold‐responsive transcriptome in comparison with that of autotetraploidS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ and shown subgenome preferential differential expression of several cold‐responsive genes inS. acaule. TheS. acauleAA9 assembly is reference quality and can be used as an aid for breeding purposes and for research on the allopolyploid species in theAcauliaseries ofSolanumsectionPetota.

TheSolanum acauleAA9 clone (a genotype maintained as an in vitro plantlet under Canadian Potato Genebank accession CN# 124026, originating from true seeds of CIP 761464, USDA PI 498202, OCH 13005;https://doi.org/10.18730/DVW~) was chosen because of its use in breeding for cold stress tolerance. The AA9 accession was originally collected in 1978 in Ancash, Peru, according to the passport information PI 498202 GRIN‐Global (https://npgsweb.ars‐grin.gov/gringlobal/accessiondetail?id=1393138) by Carlos Ochoa of the International Potato Centre (CIP). The collection site was Puca Chaca, between Tarica and Sihuas, at 4100 m. The high elevation is typical ofS. acaulehabitats. The appearance of AA9 plants was similar to otherS. acauleplants (Solanaceae source:https://solanaceaesource.myspecies.info/content/solanum‐acaule; Correll,1962). The AA9 genome was sequenced using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), Oxford Nanopore (ONT), and Illumina technologies; the transcriptome and chromatin interactions (Hi‐C) were sequenced using Illumina. The PacBio libraries were constructed as described in Achakkagari et al. (2024) and sequenced on Sequel II system using the SMRT technology (CLR [Continuous Long Reads]) at a depth of 100x. The Nanopore ONT libraries were prepared and sequenced on the PromethION at a depth of 100x as described in Achakkagari et al. (2024), and Illumina short‐read sequencing was performed on the NovaSeq 6000 platform in a paired‐end mode (2 × 150 bp) at 100x depth (Novogene Co., Ltd.). The Hi‐C libraries were prepared using Phase Genomics Proximo Plant Hi‐C version 4.0 and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform in PE 100 bp mode with ∼3 billion reads.

Solanum acaule(DPM‐AA9, CIP 761464, PI 498202, and CN# 124026) was the same clone used for genome sequencing andSolanum tuberosum‘Atlantic’ was sourced from the potato breeding collection of Agriculture and Agri‐Food Canada in Fredericton, NB, Canada Agriculture and Agri‐Food Canada. Plants were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) (Sigma) medium containing MS vitamin solution (Sigma) 1 mL/L, 30 g/L of sucrose (Sigma), and 8 g/L of agar (Sigma) in a growth chamber at 22°C, 150 µmol m‐2 s‐1 and 18‐h light 6‐h darkness and transferred to fresh medium every 4 weeks. Magenta boxes with MS medium containing shoot explants were placed in a growth chamber where the temperature gradually decreased from 22°C to −4°C at a rate of 2°C per hour. For the freezing stress treatment, plants were taken from the chamber 1 h after it reached the final temperature; they were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Long‐day conditions (as described) were used as the control treatment. Three biological replicates were analyzed for each species and condition.

The PacBio raw data were used to assemble the AA9 genome using Canu assembler v2.2 (Nurk et al.,2020) with the parametersbatOptions = ‐dg 3 ‐db 3 ‐dr 1 ‐ca 500 ‐cp 50. The nanopore raw reads were trimmed using Porechop v0.2.4 (Bonenfant et al.,2022) and filtered for at least Q10 quality scores using NanoFilt v2.8.0 (De Coster et al.,2018). The filtered reads were used to generate contigs using Flye v2.9‐b1774 (Kolmogorov et al.,2019) and NextDenovo v2.5.0 (Hu et al.,2024) assemblers. The organellar sequences were filtered from the PacBio and ONT assemblies. The PacBio assembly had superior contiguity and a higher N50 compared to the Nanopore assemblies, and was therefore selected for subsequent Hi‐C scaffolding. The Hi‐C reads were trimmed using fastp v0.23.1 (S. Chen et al.,2018) and QC'ed (where QC is quality control) using HiC‐QC v1.0 (https://github.com/phasegenomics/hic_qc). The trimmed Hi‐C reads were mapped to the filtered PacBio contigs using BWA v0.7.17 (H. Li,2013) and filtered and sorted using samtools v1.16.1 (H. Li et al.,2009). Then the contigs were corrected based on the Hi‐C signals using ALLHiC correct (X. Zhang et al.,2019). The Hi‐C reads were then mapped back to the corrected contigs and filtered to remove low‐quality hits using ALLHiC and samtools with ‐q 40. Then the contigs were scaffolded using YaHS v1.1 (Zhou et al.,2023) with‐e GATC ‐r 1000,2000,5000,10000,20000,50000,100000,200000,500000,1000000,2000000, 5000000,10000000,20000000 –no‐mem‐check ‐l 500 –no‐contig‐ec –no‐scaffold‐ecparameters. The resulting scaffolds were manually reviewed in JuiceBox v1.11.08 (Durand et al.,2016) and generated 24 chromosomes. Contigs containing assembled telomeres were correctly oriented to the terminal ends by searching for the TTTAGGG repeat (or the reverse complement CCCTAAA) using tidk (Brown et al.,2023) and FindTelomeres (https://github.com/JanaSperschneider/FindTelomeres). Then ALLHiC Rescue was used to assign unanchored contigs to specific clusters based on their Hi‐C signal density and then manually reviewed in JuiceBox. Finally, the nanopore assemblies were used within LRScaf v1.1.11 (Qin et al.,2019) to generate links between unanchored contigs and chromosomes and then were manually reviewed and added using JuiceBox. The resulting assembly was polished using the freebayes‐polish pipeline from VGP (https://github.com/VGP/vgp‐assembly/tree/master/pipeline/freebayes‐polish). Any duplicated contigs with respect to the chromosomes were removed from the assembly. The gaps introduced by scaffolding were closed using TGSgapcloser v1.2.1 (M. Xu et al.,2020) with PacBio and nanopore reads, followed by another round of freebayes‐polish to generate a cleaned chromosome‐scale assembly. The 24 chromosomes were phased into two sub‐genomes based on repetitive k‐mers as differential signatures using SubPhaser v1.2.6 (Jia et al.,2022). Unplaced contigs were screened for contamination using BlobTools v1.1.1 (Laetsch & Blaxter,2017) and by aligning against NCBI databases. This analysis identified contigs matching microbial taxa such asStreptomycessp.,Clostridiumsp., andBradyrhizobiumsp., which were subsequently removed from the final assembly.

Syntenic blocks between the two sub‐genomes were detected using MCScanX 1.0.0 (Y. Wang et al.,2012), and the synteny plots were visualized using SynVisio (https://synvisio.github.io) (Bandi et al.,2022).

Total RNA was extracted from shoot frozen samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Library preparation and sequencing was performed at the Centre d'expertise et de service Génome Québec using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, according to manufacturer's instructions. Reads were trimmed and quality filtered with Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al.,2014) and then cleaned of viral sequences with a custom pipeline. Transcriptomes for each species were assembled by generating a de novo and a reference guided assemblies withTrinity v2.14.0(Haas et al.,2013) and merging them withEvidentialGene v2022may07(Gilbert,2019). Clean reads were used to get the Trinity de novo using default parameters. To obtain the Trinity reference assemblies, reads were first mapped to their respective reference phased genomes usingHisat2 v 2.2.1(Kim et al.,2019). ForS. tuberosum, the Atlantic cultivar haplotype level genome was used as reference (Hoopes et al.,2022), and forS. acaule, the subgenome level assembly generated in this study was used. Mapped reads were used to get the Trinity reference assembly using the genome‐guided option. After merging both reference and de novo assemblies with EvidentialGene, final assemblies were cleaned of viral sequences with custom pipeline. Assembly completeness was assessed withBUSCO v5.3.2(Simão et al.,2015). The RNA reads are uploaded to NCBI and linked with BioProject PRJNA779368. Coding sequences of transcripts were annotated with TransDecoder v5.7.1 (https://github.com/TransDecoder) (Haas et al.,2013). For transcriptome length comparisons, only protein‐coding transcripts with complete CDS were considered.

Syntenic gene sets were obtained usingMCscanX 1.0.0(Y. Wang et al.,2012). InS. acaule, homoeologous gene pairs between subgenomes 1 and 2 were obtained, whereas inS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’, homologous gene sets were obtained for all haplotype combinations; only sets of genes meeting a 1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1 were selected.

Transcriptome assemblies were mapped to the respective reference genome to assign each transcript to their respective gene using GMAP v2023‐12‐01 (Wu & Watanabe,2005) with a k‐mer size of 16 and a mapping quality cutoff of 2. Transcripts were thus annotated as belonging to different subgenomes/haplotypes and to respective syntenic gene sets.

Transcript abundance estimation was calculated withKallisto v0.46.1(Bray et al.,2016), followed by differential expression analyses calculated withDESeq2v1.38.3 (Love et al.,2014). Coding regions within transcripts were predicted usingTransDecoder v5.0.0(Haas et al.,2013), and functional annotation was assigned usingTrinotate v4.0.0(Bryant et al.,2017) with default databases (UniProt, EggNOG, and Pfam). Enrichment analyses were performed using the packageGOseq v1.50.0(Young et al.,2010) on a subset of genes selected with a minimum of twofold differential expression (|log2Foldchange | > 1) andpadj < 0.05.

Homoeologous gene pairs with 1:1 ratio ofS. acauleobtained with MCscanX were used to calculate expression bias between subgenomes for each condition tested, control and freezing. Log 2 fold changes were calculated with DEseq2 v1.38.3 (Love et al.,2014). The built‐in Wald test was used to test significant differences; genes with false discovery ratepadj < 0.05 were considered.

QC was performed on the raw sequencing data (whole genome sequence [WGS] and RNA‐Seq) usingFastQC v0.11.9(Andrews,2019). An adaptor removal and read quality trimming was performed on the raw reads usingTrimmomatic v0.39(Bolger et al.,2014). Genome heterozygosity and estimated size were determined using the corrected PacBio reads. First, k‐mer frequencies were calculated (k= 21) and a k‐mer histogram was generated usingJellyfish v2.3.0(Marçais & Kingsford,2011). The k‐mer histogram was used to generate various genome characteristics withGenomeScope 2.0(Ranallo‐Benavidez et al.,2020). The quality of the raw WGS and RNA‐Seq reads was checked usingFastQC. Various metrics such as per base sequence quality, overall read quality score, GC content, N content, and overrepresented sequences were analyzed to detect low‐quality sequences or biases in the data. Amount of viral genome sequences in the RNA‐Seq data was estimated usingkraken2 v2.1.2(Wood et al.,2019) by searching against its own genome assembly and potato virus sequences downloaded from NCBI. AA9 had 95.87% of the RNAseq reads classified asSolanumwith 3.17% classified as Potato Virus X. The genome assembly quality was assessed byQUAST v5.0.2(Gurevich et al.,2013),merqury(Rhie et al.,2020),BUSCO v5.3.2(Simão et al.,2015), where contiguity and completeness of the assemblies were analyzed, and with CRAQ v1.0.9 (K. Li et al.,2023), AutoHiC v1.3.3 (Jiang et al.,2024), and 3D‐DNA v201008 (Dudchenko et al.,2017).

The genome assembly was annotated using the RNA‐Seq data as the evidence for gene prediction along with homology‐based prediction. The repeat sequences in the genome were identified using RepeatModeler v2.0.3 (Flynn et al.,2020), annotated using common runtime language scripts, and excluded the gene fragments from the unknown repeats to generate a final custom repeat library. This repeat library was used to softmask the genome using RepeatMasker v4.1.2‐pl (Smit et al.,2015). Structural annotation was performed using BRAKER v3.0.3(Gabriel et al.,2024) with both evidence‐based and homology‐based predictions. For the evidence‐based prediction, trimmed RNA‐Seq reads were aligned to the genome assembly using HiSAT2 v2.2.1 (Kim et al.,2019) and sorted and indexed using SAMtools v1.16.1. The alignment file was used as input for the BRAKER. For the homology‐based prediction, Solanales protein sequences from OrthoDB, along with the protein sequences from potato reference genomes, were combined to create a protein database for BRAKER. The BRAKER pipeline (Buchfink et al.,2015; Bruna et al.,2021,2023; Gabriel et al.,2021; Gotoh,2008; Hoff et al.,2016,2019; Iwata & Gotoh,2012; Kovaka et al.,2019; Pertea & Pertea,2020; Stanke et al.,2008,2006) used AUGUSTUS and GeneMark‐ETP to train and predict highly reliable genes. It used TSEBRA v1.0.3 to generate a combined set of genes containing only the genes with very high support from extrinsic evidence. The annotations were curated using gFACs with–rem‐all‐incompletes –rem‐genes‐without‐start‐codon –rem‐genes‐without‐stop‐codon –allow‐alternate‐startsparameters. A functional annotation was performed using AHRD (https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD.git) against Trembl, Swiss‐Prot, and Araprot databases and InterProScan v5.52‐86 against the PFAM database (Mistry et al.,2021). To assess annotation quality, we used a combination of structural, functional, and evolutionary metrics. BUSCO v5.3.2 (Simão et al.,2015) was run in protein mode with solanales_odb10 to estimate gene model completeness. OMArk v0.3.0 (Nevers et al.,2025) was used to evaluate both completeness, via conserved Solanaceae HOGs, and consistency, based on placement of proteins into known gene families. PSAURON v1.0.6 (Sommer et al.,2025) was used to score coding sequences and assess genome‐wide annotation confidence. Structural annotation statistics (e.g., gene, exon, intron counts, and genome coverage) were computed using the AGAT toolkit v1.4.2 (Dainat et al.,2020).

OrthoFinder v2.5.5.2 (Emms & Kelly,2019) was run with the protein coding genes from AA9 subgenomes, 44 diploid genomes from Tang et al. (2022), and 23 wild accessions (Achakkagari et al.,2024) to identify orthologous groups. From the resulting orthogroups, we selected 260 high‐confidence single‐copy orthologous genes that were present in all species, contained exactly one gene per species, and had full‐length protein sequences suitable for alignment. These genes were used to construct a coalescent‐based phylogenetic tree, where individual maximum likelihood (ML) gene trees were generated using IQTREE2 v2.2.7 (Minh et al.,2020) and then used ASTRAL v5.7.8 (C. Zhang et al.,2018) to generate a species tree. The phylogenetic trees were visualized inFigTree v1.4.4(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).

CBF genes were investigated inS. acauleandS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ genomes and transcriptomes. Genes and coding sequences of 11S. tuberosum CBFswere retrieved from GenBank and Phytozome. Reference CBF genes from Pennycooke et al. (2008) were retrieved from GenBank [EU365384.1_cds_ACB45095.1_1 (CBF3),EU365384.1_cds_ACB45096.1_2 (CBF1),EU365384.1_cds_ACB45097.1_3 (CBF2A),EU365384.1_cds_ACB45098.1_4 (CBF2B),EU365379.1_cds_ACB45083.1_2 (CBF4),EU365379.1_cds_ACB45082.1_1 (CBF5)] and supplemented with additional ones from W.

The reference genes were used as queries in nucleotide sequence searches of the genomes ofS. acauleand theS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ (Hoopes et al.,2022) usingBLAST+ v.2.14.0(Camacho et al.,2009). Query and candidate CBF sequences were aligned usingMUSCLE(Edgar,2004) as implemented inMEGAX v.10.2.5(Kumar et al.,2018); default parameters were used with the neighbor‐joining clustering method. A ML phylogenetic tree was constructed withMEGAXusing the Jones–Taylor–Thornton substitution model and gamma distribution with invariant sites and 100 bootstrap replications. The tree figure was edited withTreeViewer v.2.2.0(Bianchini & Sánchez‐Baracaldo,2024).

Solanum acauleclone AA9 was sequenced, assembled, and phased using PacBio, Illumina, Nanopore, and Hi‐C data with a custom bioinformatics pipeline. The assembly size is 1.34 Gb in 24 chromosomes and 188 unplaced contigs (6.7 MB) with an N50 of 56.2 Mb. The individual haplotypes of each of the two subgenomes cannot be distinguished, which indicates that each subgenome is homozygous and that the original hybridization may have been between two diploids (n+n) followed by duplication. Subgenome 1 is smaller (650 Mb) than subgenome 2 (688 Mb) with an N50 of 54.1 and 56.3 Mb, respectively (Table1). A total of 61,417 high‐confidence protein‐coding genes were found in the AA9 genome, with 56,610 genes having functional annotations. Subgenome 1 has fewer genes than subgenome 2, with 29,521 and 31,822 genes, respectively. The total classified repeats make up 64%, or 857 Mb of the genome, and the majority (28% of the repeats) are long terminal repeats (TableS1). Figure1ashows the synteny between the chromosomes of the two subgenomes ofS. acauleclone AA9. Overall, 38,899 (63%) genes are syntenic between the two subgenomes. The dotplot of the two subgenomes (FigureS1) shows high correspondence, with chromosome 1 showing high divergence and an inverted region. The inverted regions correspond with findings from earlier studies indicating cryptic differences between the two A genomes ofS. acaule(Matsubayashi,1991). Large pericentromeric inversions were also found between A and B genomes of the allotetraploidS. stoloniferum(Hosaka et al.,2025).

The bar plot shows the percent of BUSCO genes (solanales_odb 10dataset) present in each genome assembly. chr, chromosome; sub, subgenome.

A k‐mer analysis shows that the AA9 genome is highly heterozygous (5.5%) compared to cultivated potato tetraploids, for example, Q9 (1.91%), Otava (1.53%), and Atlantic (1.78%) (Hoopes et al.,2022; Sun et al.,2022; F. Wang et al.,2022; FigureS2; TableS2), and that it is within the range of heterozygosity (3.7%–12%) seen in other wild polyploid potato species (Kyriakidou, Achakkagari et al.,2020; Kyriakidou, Anglin et al.,2020) but that it is lower than the range in modern tetraploid hybrids betweenS. tuberosumand wild species (10%–11%) (Achakkagari et al.,2024; TableS2).

The BUSCO analysis of the assembly shows that the two subgenomes enhance each other in terms of gene complement, as the whole assembly is more complete (99.1%) than either of the subgenomes (98.0% and 98.1%, respectively) (Figure1; Table1). Combining genomes from differentPetotaspecies leads to an overall larger genome in terms of gene complement, as seen with, for example, thePetotasuper pangenome (Bozan et al.,2023). It is known that subgenomes of allopolyploids often unevenly retain their gene complements (Steige & Slotte,2016) and together with the advantage of heterosis (Comai,2005), it is part of their success. The Merqury analysis shows 99.6% of k‐mer completeness indicative of a high‐quality assembly, and also shows an overlap of 10%–20% of the reads that map equally well to both subgenomes. The consensus quality value is high, with 48.2, 49.1, and 48.7 for the total assembly, subgenome 1, and 2, respectively. The assembly quality was also estimated using CRAQ (K. Li et al.,2023), which assesses regional and structural errors. An overall assembly quality of (S‐AQI) 92% and regional assembly quality (R‐AQI) of 97.3% resulted. The Hi‐C contact map (Figure1b) shows a strong, continuous diagonal line indicating the contigs and scaffolds are correctly ordered and oriented, and the intra‐chromosomal contacts are well defined with high contact frequencies (FigureS3). There are regions with no detectable Hi‐C contacts, corresponding to gaps in the interaction matrix, which likely represent centromeric regions, similar to what was found in other studies (Q. Li et al.,2019). These gaps have also been used to assist with detecting centromeres (e.g., D. Xu et al.,2024). The Hi‐C maps were manually reviewed, as well as reviewed using AutoHiC (Jiang et al.,2024), detecting some “debris” corresponding to the no signal regions but no assembly errors such as inversions or translocations (FigureS4). Three mismatches were identified at the start of two chromosomes by 3D‐DNA (Dudchenko et al.,2017), but upon closer inspection, these regions were found to be misannotated as mismatches. These segments, each less than 700 bp, do not represent true assembly errors but likely result from algorithmic sensitivity to small structural variations or boundary artifacts.

In addition to the assembly assessment, QC was also performed on the genome annotation to evaluate its completeness, structural accuracy, and functional depth. The overall gene models exhibited high completeness, with 95.9% of conserved genes identified by BUSCO. Subgenome 1 and subgenome 2 individually showed completeness scores of 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively (FigureS5). Psauron (Sommer et al.,2025) assigned a high confidence score of 96.5, supporting the overall accuracy of predicted gene models. OMARK (Nevers et al.,2025) assessment using Solanaceae‐specific HOGs found 95.4% of conserved genes present, with 79.3% duplicated and only 4.6% missing (FigureS6). Consistency analysis showed that 92.6% of proteins matched gene families from the expected lineage, only 1.0% were inconsistent, and no contaminants were detected. Structurally, the annotation comprises 57,592 genes and 61,417 mRNAs, with a mean of 4.9 exons and 3.9 introns per transcript. Functional annotation showed strong coverage: 92% of gene models (56,610) had matches in Araport/SwissProt/TrEMBL, 72% (44,265) matched InterPro domains, and 45% (27,663) were associated with gene ontology (GO) terms. Together, these metrics indicate a well‐supported, high‐quality annotation suitable for downstream genomic and comparative analyses.

The success of allotetraploidS. acauleas a cold‐adapted species, typically placed in Clade 4, is attributed to its hybrid origin, though the progenitor species have been unknown to date. Previous studies found thatS. acaulelikely has origins in both Clade 3 and 4 (e.g., Cai et al.,2012), though the duplicated nature of plant genomes, the frequent interspecies hybridization in theSolanumgenus, together with technical limitations on earlier methods made complete analyses difficult. While organellar data may be able to pinpoint the maternal progenitor species of an allopolyploid, it is typically problematic to include allopolyploids in phylogenies based on nuclear data as their hybrid nature adds confusion. However, with subgenome assemblies and an increasing number of comparator genomes available, studies are now better poised to answer such questions. LettingS. acaulesubgenome 1 and 2 represent their respective progenitor species, Figure2shows their respective placement in aSolanumsectionPetotaphylogeny. Subgenome 2 places securely withS. megistacolobumgenomes (Achakkagari et al.,2024). Previous studies using plastid data also placedS. acaulewithSolanum megistacrolobum(Nakagawa & Hosaka,2002; Park,2021; Yan et al.,2023), showing that this is undoubtedly the maternal progenitor species ofS. acaule. Previous taxonomic studies onS. megistacrolobumandS. acauleusing restriction fragment length polymorphism markers and nitrate reductase sequence data similarly indicated close relationship between the two species (Giannattasio & Spooner,1994; Rodriguez & Spooner,2009), and natural hybridization between the two species was found (Okada & Clausen,1982). WhileS. megistacrolobumgroups with Clade 4 species, in the present study as well as in studies based on the wholePetotasuper pangenome, it is found thatS. megistacrolobumspecies form a separate and basal clade within Clade 4 South (Achakkagari et al.,2024; Bozan et al.,2023). Subgenome 1 forms a basal group in Clade 3, which explains early results showing thatS. acaulecarries Clade 3 alleles (Cai et al.,2012). However, no close relative was found for subgenome 1.S. acaulemay be a case where the genome of a now extinct species lives on only as a “ghost” part of this unique allopolyploid (Luo et al.,2017), or alternatively the progenitor of subgenome 1 is a rare species that is yet to be sequenced. The results are also consistent with the genomes of Clade 3 species being generally slightly smaller than those of the Clade 4 species (Bozan et al.,2023).

A multispecies coalescent based phylogenetic tree places the subgenomes ofSolanum acaulewith the closest relatives to identify progenitor species. Subgenome 1 is with Clade 3 species, but there is no close relative identified. Subgenome 2 groups with theSolanum megistacrolobumgenomes with Clade 4.

The habitat ofS. acaulein extreme high altitudes requires frost tolerance. One of the most fundamental gene families involved in plant response to cold temperature is theC‐repeat binding factor(CBF) gene family. To study the presence and evolution ofCBFgenes in frost‐tolerantS. acauleand frost‐sensitiveS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’, coding sequences were retrieved by a nucleotide BLAST search of their genome assemblies. Candidate genes from the twoS. acaulesubgenomes and the fourS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ haplotypes (Hoopes et al.,2022) were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Figure3a). Most of the 11CBFquery sequences were found in all subgenomes or haplotypes with a few exceptions.CBF1,CBF2A,CBF3,CBF4, andCBF7genes were found in all haplotypes and subgenomes. The cluster of genesCBF3,CBF1,CBF2A,CBF2B,CBF5, andCBF4is organized within a small region (∼25 kb) on chromosome 3 in the mentioned order (Figure3b). A similar gene organization has been previously reported in variousSolanumspecies, for example,Solanum commersoniiandS. tuberosum(Aversano et al.,2015; Pennycooke et al.,2008). While the order of the genes within this cluster is conserved across all haplotypes and subgenomes, the presence of all genes is not uniformly conserved.CBF5was only found inS. acaulesubgenome 1 and inS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ haplotypes 1 and 2 (Figure3a).CBF5was previously noted inS. tuberosum, but missing inS. commersonii(Aversano et al.,2015). It is interesting thatS. acaulesubgenome 2, which is phylogenetically close toS. commersonii(Figure2), also lacksCBF5.CBF6is located on chromosome 11 but is absent inS. tuberosumhaplotypes 2 and 4.CBF7was located on chromosome 7 in both subgenomes ofS. acauleand all haplotypes ofS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’. SeveralCBF8,CBF9, andCBF10genes were identified in the genome assemblies on chromosome 8; however, inS. tuberosum, some of these sequences originated from unphased contigs and thus these three genes were not included in further analyses.

Bars on the right represent multiple sequence alignments of C‐repeat binding factor (CBF) protein sequences.

(c) Dotplot of alignment region of chromosome 3 of subgenomes 1 and 2 ofS. acaulecontaining CBF gene cluster. Annotated outside of axes are genes (blue arrows) and repetitive elements (red lines). Indels are marked as green bars. Large orange circle marks the location of the pseudogeneCBF2Bψ. Small orange circle indicates the location of the pseudogeneCBF2Bψ2in subgenome 1 that aligns withCBF2Bof subgenome 2.

Notably, in the fourS. tuberosumhaplotypes and twoS. acaulesubgenomes,CBF2Bis absent only inS. acaulesubgenome 1. A missingCBF2Bwas previously noted inS. commersonii(Aversano et al.,2015; Pennycooke et al.,2008). It was suggested thatCBF2Bwas lost from theS. commersoniigenome, leaving behind a pseudogene,CBF2Bψ, as a remnant (Pennycooke et al.,2008). However, our analysis of theCBFregion reveals that this pseudogene (CBF2Bψ) is present in both subgenomes ofS. acaule(Figure3c, orange circle) as well as in haplotypes 1, 3, and 4 in theS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’, always located between the copies ofCBF2AandCBF2B(except inS. acaulesubgenome 1, which lacks theCBF2Bcoding sequence and where the pseudogene is downstream of theCBF2; Figure3b). This suggests that the pseudogene inS. commersonii(Pennycooke et al.,2008) is not a mutatedCBF2B, but a different copy of aCBFgene that was already a pseudogene in a common ancestor of these species. Additionally, a ∼30 bp small segment (that we labelCBF2Bψ2) of the authenticCBF2Bupstream sequence was identified inS. acaulechr3_1 (subgenome 1) at the edge of a deletion where aCBF2Bgene would be expected (Figure3b; Figure3c, orange arrow, deletions marked as green lines).Solanum commersoniialso has aCBF3pseudogeneψCBF3(Aversano et al.,2015) that was not detected in eitherS. acauleorS. tuberosum. The Figure3cdot plot also shows two additional significant indels (green lines): an insertion in chr3_2 (subgenome 2), containing an unidentified gene that seems to be a duplication of a different region from chromosome 3, and a deletion representing the loss ofCBF5in subgenome 2. Our findings support the idea that theCBFgene family inSolanumis undergoing rapid evolution driven by processes of expansion via gene duplication followed by gene loss and pseudogenization (Aversano et al.,2015).

To analyze freezing response‐related differences,S. acauleAA9 andS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ plants were subjected to freezing conditions and their transcriptomes sequenced and assembled. TheS. acauleAA9 transcriptome (control and freezing) contains 245,390 total transcripts and that ofS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ contains 252,591 transcripts, with total transcriptome assembly lengths of 360 Mb and 470 Mb, respectively. A BUSCO completeness assessment shows that both transcriptome assemblies are highly complete with 96.2% and 95.9% forS. acauleandS. tuberosum, respectively. Because not all genes are expressed at the same time, the BUSCO scores for the transcriptomes are lower than the scores of the genome assemblies.

Generally, while the transcriptomes ofS. acauleandS. tuberosumboth have a similar CG (cytosine guanine) content (39.06% and 39.16%, respectively), theS. acauletranscripts are shorter, averaging 1469 bp, compared to the average of 1863 bp forS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’. Differences in average transcript length betweenSolanumspecies have previously been observed (Gramazio et al.,2016). When considering only protein‐coding transcripts, the median transcript length is 2069 bp inS. acauleand 2312 bp inS. tuberosum, with the latter being significantly longer (Mann–Whitney U test,p< 0.001). WithinS. acaule, subgenome 2 has slightly longer transcripts (2114 bp) and coding sequence (CDS) (1136 bp) on average than subgenome 1 (2057 bp transcripts and 1062 bp CDS;p< 0.001). In contrast,S. tuberosumtranscript and CDS lengths remain consistent across the four haplotypes (protein‐coding transcript average ranges from 2316 to 2323 bp; CDS from 1193 to 1203 bp;p> 0.01 in all comparisons). This difference in transcript length may be partly explained by differences in the set of genes being expressed in each species. However, both transcriptomes exhibit comparable BUSCO completeness scores and total transcript numbers, suggesting that neither assembly is missing major gene content. An alternative explanation is thatS. tuberosumexpresses a higher proportion of longer transcript isoforms, possibly due to gene structural differences. The longer CDS average inS. tuberosumsuggests that this is the case, rather than the primary source of difference being from alternative splicing and/or UTR length.

Transcripts were mapped to their respective reference subgenome or haplotype. InS. acaule, 229,953 transcripts or 93.7% of all transcripts were successfully mapped, and inS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’, 226,933 transcripts or 89.8% were successfully mapped. The lower mapping success rate in the latter may be due to the higher number of unphased scaffolds in theS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ assembly. InS. acaule, 55.1% of the transcripts mapped to subgenome 2 (Table2), which contains 52% of allS. acaulegenes (Table1), and 44.8% of the transcripts mapped to subgenome 1 (Table2), which contains 48% of the genes (Table1). InS. tuberosum, haplotypes 1 and 2 exhibit lower rates of mapped transcripts (19.2% and 22.5%, respectively) than haplotypes 3 and 4 (25.0% and 24.3%; Table2).

Note: Differentially expressed transcripts were selected with the cutoff values |log2Foldchange (LFC )| > 1 andpadj < 0.05.

To detect any potential overall expression bias toward eitherS. acaulesubgenome, relative expression levels of homoeologous genes from both subgenomes were compared. Because the two subgenomes have partially different gene complements, a subset of 16,325 genes that have homoeologs on bothS. acaulesubgenomes was identified using MCScanX (Y. Wang et al.,2012). A total of 12,673 of these homoeologous gene pairs (77.6%) were expressed in either one or both subgenomes in freezing conditions, while in control conditions, 12,561 gene pairs (76.9%) were expressed. Under freezing conditions, for 50.32% of the gene pairs the copy from subgenome 2 was favored, compared to the 49.68% of gene pairs where the copy from subgenome 1 was favored (Figure4a). Similarly, under control conditions, for 50.23% of the expressed gene pairs, the gene from subgenome 2 was favored, while for 49.77% the gene from subgenome 1 was favored. These results suggest an overall balanced expression pattern between the subgenomes across both conditions in this subset of homoeologous genes. Furthermore, it suggests that the progenitors ofS. acauleco‐existed in the cold high‐altitude range in the high Andes as both transcriptomes contribute to adaptation to cold and frost, which concurs with reported cold and frost tolerance forS. megistacrolobumand Clade 3 species (Hijmans et al.,2003) as well as thePetotasuper pangenome analysis of core genes in the Clade 3 species showing an enrichment of cold and abiotic stress‐related genes (Bozan et al.,2023).

(a) Overlap of differentially expressed (DE) homeologous gene pairs across subgenomes inSolanum acaule, and homologous gene sets across haplotypes inSolanum tuberosum‘Atlantic’. Genes were selected as DE with cutoff criteria of |log2Foldchange | > 1 andpadj < 0.05. (b) Distribution of expression bias of 1:1 homeologous gene pairs between subgenomes ofS. acauleunder control and freezing conditions. Negative log2 values indicate bias toward subgenome 1 and positive values indicate bias toward subgenome 2. Genes are only considered if the differential expression is significant withpadj > 0.05 (dark colored bars).

Differential gene expression analysis of freezing treatment versus control was carried out for each of the two species. Overall, the results are very similar to the proportion of total number of transcripts mapped to each subgenome and haplotype. That is,S. acaulesubgenome 1 has a smaller proportion of the DE transcripts (41.9%) than its proportion of genes in the wholeS. acaulegenome (48%), and subgenome 2 has a larger proportion (55.5%) than its proportion of genes (52%) (Table2). Interestingly though, inS. acaulesubjected to freezing, only 33.9% of the downregulated differentially expressed (DE) transcripts originate from subgenome 1, while 62.6% originate from subgenome 2 (Table2). InS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ the DE transcripts are mapped more or less equally to all four haplotypes—around 20% (Table2).

In allS. tuberosumhaplotypes, about 26% fewer genes are differentially downregulated than upregulated in freezing conditions. InS. acaule, on the other hand, subgenome 2 had only 16% fewer genes downregulated than upregulated, while subgenome 1 had 52% fewer genes downregulated than upregulated. This indicates a possibility that genes that need to be downregulated in freezing conditions were already downregulated in subgenome 1, and so show no differential expression (reflecting a cold‐adapted Clade 3 member), similar to other cold‐adapted plants, for example,Oxytropis arctobia(Archambault & Strömvik,2011). Alternatively, it may be that those genes that need to be downregulated are favoring the copy in subgenome 2, which had many more genes downregulated in freezing conditions than subgenome 1. Subgenome 2, essentiallyS. megistacrolobum, which is known for its frost tolerance (Hijmans et al.,2003), and its transcriptome responds more strongly and with different gene homologs to freezing conditions.

To detect potential bias in the DE gene pairs rather than in all expressed genes, a set similar to the homoeologous gene pairs inS. acaulewas generated forS. tuberosumusing MCScanX (Y. Wang et al.,2012). A set of 9331 genes that have homologs on at least two of the Atlantic haplotypes resulted. To investigate expression preference inS. acauleandS. tuberosum, DE transcripts (both up‐ and downregulated) were assigned to the homoeologous gene pairs (S. acaule) or homologous gene sets (S. tuberosum). As shown in the Venn diagram (Figure4b), a greater number of homoeologous DE genes originate fromS. acaulesubgenome 2 (1013) compared to the homoeologous DE genes that originate from subgenome 1 (760). This supports the above finding that subgenome 2 has more differentially expressed genes overall, even when looking at the same set of gene complement (the set of homoeologous gene pairs). Only a small set of homoeologous genes (143) were differentially expressed in both subgenomes (Figure4b). InS. tuberosum, the homolog preference in DE genes ranged between 1605 and 2232 for the four haplotypes, and similarly toS. acaule, only 144 genes had homologs DE in all four haplotypes.

These results are supported by studies of other allopolyploids, where one subgenome exhibits higher overall expression levels after hybridization (Alger & Edger,2020; Steige & Slotte,2016). InS. acaule, overall, subgenome 2 has more genes than subgenome 1 (52% vs. 48% of all genes in the genome), more transcripts (55% vs. 45%), and more downregulated genes in freezing conditions (62.6% vs. 33.9%). When looking at a set of expressed homoeologous gene pairs, each subgenome had about 50% of the favored homoeologs, though importantly, looking at the DE homoeologous gene pairs, subgenome 2 has many more (1013 vs. 760). This contrast in gene regulation could be linked to the origins of each parent species, each with different regulatory thresholds for gene expression as have been observed in other allopolyploid species (Chalhoub et al.,2014; Garsmeur et al.,2014; VanBuren et al.,2020; Xing et al.,2023). Expression bias toward one subgenome is commonly observed (Buggs et al.,2011; Edger et al.,2017; Li et al.,2014; Schnable et al.,2011; H. Tang et al.,2012; Yang et al.,2016; Yoo et al.,2012). In the case of the allopolyploidIsoetes sinensis, it was found that one of the subgenomes provided more contributions to high‐altitude adaptation, which corresponds with the parental species that is better suited to high altitudes (Wei et al.,2022).

TwoS. acaule CBFgenes,CBF1from subgenome 1 andCBF4from subgenome 2, were significantly upregulated in freezing conditions compared to the control. In contrast, inS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’, onlyCBF1is upregulated in freezing conditions and only the copy on haplotype 1. Interestingly, overexpression ofS. tuberosum CBF1andCBF4in transgenicArabidopsis thalianahas been shown to increase tolerance to low temperatures and to affect expression ofCORgenes, withCBF4having a greater effect thanCBF1(Song et al.,2021). Our results support previous reports fromSolanumspecies, indicating that among all theCBFgenes in the cluster, onlyCBF1andCBF4are cold induced (Pennycooke et al.,2008; Zhang et al.,2004); they also contrast with other findings in cold‐tolerant potato and tomato species (Aversano et al.,2015; Mboup et al.,2012), where allCBFgenes are cold‐induced. This inconsistency inCBFgene expression under low‐temperature conditions appears to be common acrossSolanumspecies, highlighting the complexity of the CBF regulatory system landscape.

CBL protein, a Ca2+signal transducer, was previously identified as being significantly upregulated in frost‐tolerantSolanumspecies, includingS. acaule(Chen et al.2022). However, in our study, theCBLgene was upregulated inS. tuberosum, while inS. acaule, though present in the transcriptomes of both control and cold conditions, no significant differential expression was detected. These discrepancies may stem from differences in cold treatment protocols. Despite this, a protein that decodes Ca2+signaling together with CBL, CBL‐interacting protein kinase, was found in our study to be DE in bothS. acauleand theS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’ in all subgenomes and haplotypes. Differences in experimental design, particularly growth conditions, likely contribute to the varying reports of whichCBFgenes are cold‐induced or cold‐responsive. To minimize the confounding effects of other abiotic factors, our approach was to investigate plants grown in vitro rather than in soil. Though this is a common practice, in vitro culture has been shown to impact transcriptome expression profiles. For instance, inCamellia sinensis, the upregulation of lignin biosynthesis, cytochrome, and strigolactone response genes was higher in plants grown in vitro compared to those grown in vivo under nitrogen deficiency (Samarina et al.,2024). Cold treatment protocols may also contribute to the discrepancies observed across studies. For instance, L. Chen et al. (2022) exposed plants to 4°C for 3 h, whereas our experiment used a gradual temperature decrease from 22°C to −4°C, with chilling conditions (<4°C) maintained for 5 h. Collectively, these differences in growth environment likely account for variation in the expression ofCBFandCBLgenes acrossSolanumspecies.

A GO enrichment analysis on upregulated genes revealed the most abundant terms in the subgenome 2 transcriptome, such as ribosome biogenesis, cell wall biogenesis, DNA‐binding transcription factor (TF) activity, and phospholipid biosynthesis. Among these genes, TFs such as CBF4, calmodulin‐binding transcription activators, and auxin response factors were preferentially upregulated in subgenome 2, while other genes, such as the REI1‐LIKE (REIL) protein, a ribosome biogenesis factor, were exclusively upregulated in subgenome 2. REIL proteins are cytosolic 60S ribosomal biogenesis factors crucial for cold acclimation, as they accelerate de novo ribosome synthesis at low temperatures (Cheong et al.,2021). In contrast, genes upregulated in subgenome 1 were enriched for gene silencing (e.g., Argonaute), circadian regulation, beta‐amylase activity, and nitrate transmembrane transporter activity. These findings indicate that frost tolerance inS. acauleis likely the combined result of the two subgenomes; that is, the greater cold‐responsiveness indicates that especially subgenome 2 is cold‐acclimating and responds to cold temperatures by inducing genes such asCBF4andREIL, while other important genes such asCBLare already expressed.

Enriched GO terms among DE genes were analyzed to investigate potential functional differences and similarities betweenS. acauleandS. tuberosumplants under freezing conditions. The results show that the two species share similar overrepresented processes (Table3). Among the most upregulated functions are “transcription factor activity” and “DNA‐binding transcription factor activity,” including TFs such as WRKY TFs, ethylene‐responsive transcription factor (ERFs), NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) TFs, and cycling DOF factors. WRKY is a large plant‐specific family of genes responsible for regulating abiotic stress response in plants (Khoso et al.,2022). ERFs are also a conserved TF family in plants related to the Apetala 2 domain involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway of the abiotic stress response (Fujimoto et al.,2000). DOF TFs influence multiple aspects of growth and development but are also involved in regulating many abiotic stress‐responsive genes (Corrales et al.,2014).

Gene ontology enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes fromSolanum acauleandSolanum tuberosum.

Other upregulated processes that were identified in common between the two species include fruit ripening, comprising genes implicated in the metabolism of plant hormones such as ethylene (1‐aminocyclopropane‐1‐carboxylate oxidase 1) and abscisic acid (abscisic acid 8′‐hydroxylase 1), as well as genes involved in cell wall modification (polygalacturonase‐1 non‐catalytic subunit beta, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase).

The genome of allotetraploid potato wild relativeSolanum acauleBitt. (AA9) was sequenced and phased to the subgenome level. The progenitor species of subgenome 2 is determined to beS. megistacrolobumofSolanumsectionPetotaClade 4, while subgenome 1 is likely a “ghost” genome whose progenitor species is extinct but which would have been associated with Clade 3. The two progenitor species would have grown in proximity in the same high‐altitude environment that required frost tolerance, and while subgenome 1 is smaller and contains fewer genes than subgenome 2, together the subgenomes make the species more complete and competitive. Interestingly, subgenome 2 andS. megistacrolobumare phylogenetically close toS. commersonii(Clade 4), which is well‐known for its frost tolerance. Several similarities were found betweenS. acauleandS. commersoniiin theCBFgene family and also contrasted with the haplotypes ofS. tuberosum‘Atlantic’. Furthermore, while there is no overall subgenome expression bias in a set of homoeologous genes, DE genes showed noticeable differences between theS. acaulesubgenomes, both in the number of regulated genes and in their functional roles. Subgenome 2 overexpresses genes related to abiotic stress responses, including cold acclimation, transcription regulation, and ribosome biogenesis, while subgenome 1 specializes in processes such as RNA silencing, circadian regulation, and metabolic activities like beta‐amylase and nitrate transport. This functional divergence observed between the subgenomes may reflect their distinct evolutionary origins and roles in responding to environmental stresses. Taken together, our results suggest that both subgenomes contribute to the cold tolerance and success ofS. acauleas a species—subgenome 1 is cold adapted, while subgenome 2 (S. megistacrolobum) is cold acclimating and responds stronger to freezing conditions.
