Carbapenem-resistantVibrio parahaemolyticushas emerged and spread extensively in China, posing a substantial threat to food safety and human health. This study investigated the prevalence of carbapenem resistance inV. parahaemolyticusstrains recovered from various types of food samples in China, and the underlying mechanisms of transmission of theblaNDM-1gene harbored by such strains. In this work, a total of 230 (62.1%) strains were isolated from seafood samples collected in Changsha, Hunan Province; among them, 47 strains were found to be cefotaxime-resistant. These strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and found to exhibit significant genetic diversity; among them, 13 strains were found to carry theblaNDM-1gene. Nanopore sequencing showed that theblaNDM-1gene was located in the chromosome in strain VP288 but was plasmid-borne in the other 12 strains. AllblaNDM-1-bearing plasmids were of the IncC type that harbored a conserved backbone. However, the multidrug resistance regions differed significantly from each other and could be classified into four groups: (1) the plasmid pVP181-NDM was the longest and carried an additional Tn7 transposase gene; (2) both pVP156-NDM and pVP209-NDM contained two structurally different resistance regions; (3) both pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM harbored twoblaNDMgenes flanked by three copies of ISCR1insertion elements; (4) the plasmids pVP228-NDM and pVP14-NDM contained an MDR region similar to that of pVP181-NDM. The high-level carbapenem resistance phenotype exhibited by foodborneV. parahaemolyticusunderscores an urgent need for the development of effective control strategies and surveillance to limit the spread of the carbapenem resistance determinants carried by these strains.

• The rate of resistance of food-borne V. parahaemolyticus strains to carbapenems was at a concerning level.

• The blaNDM-1gene was located in IncC-type plasmids which shared a conserved backbone.

• The MDR profiles of blaNDM-1-bearing plasmids varied significantly.

Vibriospp. is a group of Gram-negative halophilic and mesophilic bacteria that commonly inhabit various types of aquatic environments, including the estuarine, marine, and aquaculture habitats (Jo et al.2020). To date, more than 100 species ofVibriohave been identified, withV. parahaemolyticusbeing the most extensively studied pathogen due to the fact that strains of this species are frequently recovered from seafood and seawater samples (Dutta et al.2021). Although the majority of environmental strains ofV. parahaemolyticusare non-pathogenic, those that can cause human infections represent a significant foodborne hazard as they are capable of causing a range of diseases ranging from gastroenteritis to septicemia, with symptoms such as watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and fever. The route of infection primarily involves consumption of cross-contaminated shellfish, raw or undercooked seafood, or exposure to contaminated seawater and aquatic products (Dutta et al.2021; Goh et al.2022; Stephen et al.2022). Infections caused by pathogenic strains ofV. parahaemolyticusmay require hospitalization and result in substantial economic loss in both the aquaculture and healthcare sectors.

Treatment of severe or prolonged illnesses caused byV. parahaemolyticustypically involves antibiotics such as tetracycline or ciprofloxacin (Elmahdi et al.2016). However, improper or excessive use of antimicrobials in aquaculture, agriculture, and clinical settings has led to the frequent emergence and evolution of antibiotic resistance inV. parahaemolyticus. Notably, the emergence of genes conferring resistance to cephalosporins (Li et al.2015,2016; Zheng et al.2021) (blaCMY-2,blaPER-1,blaCTX-Ms,blaCARB-17andblaVEB-2), quinolones (Xu et al.2023) (qnrSandqnrVC), and carbapenems (Cheng et al.2021; Zheng et al.2024,2022,2019b) (blaVAM-1,blaVMB-1,blaNDM-1andblaVIMs) have been documented, highlighting a sharp increase in the level of antimicrobial resistance in this pathogen in recent years. TheblaNDM-1gene, commonly associated with other drug-resistant bacterial pathogens such as carbapenem-resistantEnterobacterales, such asKlebsiella pneumoniae,Escherichia coli, andCitrobacterspp., has also been identified inV. parahaemolyticusin recent years. Nevertheless, a lack of comprehensive analysis of the genetic contexts ofblaNDM-1gene inV. parahaemolyticus, especially strains of food origin, hampers scientific efforts in delineating the route by whichV. parahaemolyticusevolves to become carbapenem resistant.

In the present study, we employed whole-genome sequencing to explore the epidemiological characteristics ofV. parahaemolyticusisolates recovered from food samples collected in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, between the period January 2022 and March 2023. We investigated the genetic structures of the mobile genetic elements surrounding theblaNDM-1gene in plasmids isolated from the test strains to elucidate the molecular features and transmission mechanisms of theblaNDM-1gene in foodborneV. parahaemolyticusstrains. Our findings, which show that theblaNDM-1gene can adapt to exist in plasmids of different structural categories, suggest that this important resistance gene can be transmitted efficiently amongV. parahaemolyticusstrains.

V. parahaemolyticusstrains were recovered from seafood samples (abalone, clam, razor clam, shrimp, fish, sea snail, and scallop) collected from markets and supermarkets in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, during the period of January 2022 to March 2023, during a foodborne pathogen surveillance program in China. The suspiciousV. parahaemolyticuscolonies were isolated as previously described with slight modification (Zheng et al.2019a). Briefly, the strains were selected on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar plates with or without the antibiotics such as cefotaxime (2 mg/L), meropenem (0.5 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (0.5 mg/L) and tigecycline (0.5 mg/L, TIG), and modified cellobiose-polymyxin B-colistin agar base (MCPC) agar plates without any antibiotics, respectively. All the strains were identified asV. parahaemolyticusby MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker) and multiplex PCR assays, followed by confirmation by WGS.

Antimicrobial susceptibilities of theV. parahaemolyticusstrains were determined by the standard agar dilution method and interpreted in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (CLSI2017). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 11 antibiotics were tested on theV. parahaemolyticusisolates; the test drugs included ampicillin, cefotaxime, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, tigecycline, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, azithromycin, and colistin.Escherichia coliATCC25922 andStaphylococcus aureusATCC29213 were utilized as the quality control strains. AllV. parahaemolyticusstrains were screened for the presence of theblaNDM-1gene by PCR, using primers as previously described (Liu et al.2022). To evaluate the transferability ofblaNDM-1gene, filter mating conjugation assays were performed usingblaNDM-1-carryingV. parahaemolyticusstrains as the donor strains and the sodium azide-resistant strainE. coliJ53 as the recipient at 37 ℃ at a ratio of 1:1. Transconjugants were selected on MacConkey agar plates containing meropenem (0.5 mg/L) and sodium azide (100 mg/L) and identified by using MALDI-TOF MS. The presence of theblaNDM-1gene in transconjugants was further confirmed by PCR, and the antibiotic resistance profiles were determined by MIC assays as described above.

The genomic DNA ofV. parahaemolyticuswas extracted by using the PureLink genomic DNA Mini kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The draft whole-genome reads were generated by using the Illumina and the Nanopore MinION platform. The Illumina paired-end libraries were prepared by using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and were multiplexed and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform for 300 cycles (250 bp paired end), and the reads were assembled by SPAdes v3.6.2 (Bankevich et al.2012). The library for ONT sequencing was constructed using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing kit (rapid barcoding kit 96; SQK-RBK110.96). In the next step, de novo hybrid assembly of both Illumina short reads and ONT long reads was performed using Unicycler v0.4.8 (Wick et al.2017). Contigs with a length of less than 500 bp were discarded. The assembled genomes were annotated by the RAST tool (Overbeek et al.2014) and the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP). Antimicrobial resistance genes, target mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and plasmid replicon types were obtained by using ABRicate v.1.0.1 (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) and AMRFinder v.3.8.4 (Feldgarden et al.2019). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using Snippy v4.6.0; a ML phylogenetic tree was generated by using FastTree (Price et al.2009) with default parameters, and mid-point was rooted and visualized by iTOL (Letunic and Bork2019; Stamatakis2006). BRIG (Alikhan et al.2011) and Easyfig (Sullivan et al.2011) were used to generate multiple and pairwise sequences for comparison of the plasmids tested in this study.

The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 47 V. parahaemolyticusisolates have been deposited in GenBank and assigned the accession numbersJBJJKA000000000toJBJJKY000000000andJBJJJH000000000toJBJJJZ000000000. Additionally, the complete nucleotide sequences of pVP181-NDM, pVP156-NDM, pVP205-NDM, pVP148-NDM, pVP228-NDM, pVP14-NDM, and pVP209-NDM have been submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession numbersPP860827 to PP860833, respectively.

A total of 230 non-duplicateV. parahaemolyticusstrains were isolated from 195 fresh seafood samples collected in different markets in Changsha, Hunan Province in China. These included 50 abalone, 21 clam, 36 razor clam, 76 shrimp, and 12 other types of seafood samples, including 1 sea snail, 7 fish, and 4 scallop samples purchased from January 2022 to March 2023 (TableS1). The contamination rate ofV. parahaemolyticusin seafood products was 62.1% (Table1). Among theseV. parahaemolyticusstrains, 42 were isolated from abalone, 38 were from clam, 61 were recovered from the razor clam, 75 were obtained from shrimp, and 14 were from other types of seafood samples. The isolation rate ofV. parahaemolyticuswas the highest in clam (90.5%), followed by razor clam (80.6%), shrimp (56.5%), and abalone (50.0%), with the lowest rate being observed in other types of seafood samples (41.7%) (Table1). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that these strains exhibited resistance to most of the test antibiotics, with a resistance rate of 100% to ampicillin, followed by cefotaxime (71.3%), kanamycin (36.1%), chloramphenicol (30.0%), meropenem (7.4%), ciprofloxacin (5.7%), amikacin (5.7%), and tetracycline (0.9%). However, all the strains remained susceptible to colistin and tigecycline (Table S2). PCR screening for the carbapenemase gene revealed that 5.6% (13 out of 230) of theV. parahaemolyticusisolates tested positive for theblaNDM-1gene. These isolates were subsequently subjected to analysis by conjugation experiments. The results indicated that theblaNDM-1-encoding plasmid was conjugative in 92.3% (12 out of 13) of the test strains, with conjugation frequencies ranging from 8.6 × 10⁻5to 1.3 × 10⁻3(Fig.1).

Among the 230 foodborneV. parahaemolyticusisolates tested, 47 cefotaxime-resistant strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The phenotypic characteristics of these 47 cefotaxime-resistant strains are shown in Fig.1; it should be noted that 17 of the strains also exhibited carbapenem resistance. BLASTn results showed that the primary mechanism conferring third-generation cephalosporin resistance in foodborneVibriois dissemination of β-lactam resistance genes (blaCARB,n= 47;blaCMY-4,n= 1;blaCTX-Ms,n= 10;blaNDM-1,n= 13;blaOXA-10,n= 1;blaPER-1,n= 1;blaVEB-1,n= 1; andblaVMB-1,n= 4), with theblaNDM-1gene being the most prevalent. The other resistance genes identified in these strains were those which conferred resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(3)-IId,n= 7;aac(6′)-Ia,n= 1;aadA16,n= 7;ant(2″)-Ia,n= 7;ant(3″)-Ia,n= 1;aph(3′)-Ia,n= 9;strA,n= 22; andstrB,n= 22), florfenicol (cmlA,n= 1 andfloR,n= 18), quinolones (aac(6′)-Ib-cr,n= 11;qnrD1,n= 4;qnrS,n= 2; andqnrVC,n= 5), tetracyclines (tet(34),n= 44;tet(35),n= 7;tet(A),n= 20;tet(B),n= 1;tet(E),n= 4 andtet(M),n= 1), sulfonamides (sul1,n= 21 andsul2,n= 23), trimethoprim (dfrA,n= 24), macrolides (mph(A),n= 10), and rifampin (ARR-3,n= 8) (Fig.1). No QRDR point mutations were detected in the entire strain collection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the foodborneV. parahaemolyticusstrains were genetically diverse and not clonally disseminated, indicating that theblaNDM-1-bearing strains have evolved through multiple pathways. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identified 19 distinct sequence types (STs). Specifically, ST114, ST1776, ST2602, ST532, and ST1847 were each found in two strains. The following sequence types were each found in one strain: ST1152, ST3063, ST2792, ST918, ST2989, ST12, ST108, ST1354, ST2726, ST843, ST1061, ST1363, ST970, and ST864. Additionally, 23 isolates were assigned to unknown STs based on cluster analysis. The MLST diversity corroborates the findings of the phylogenetic analysis, indicating that theV. parahaemolyticusstrains originated from different sources (Fig.1).

To investigate genetic characteristics and transmission mechanisms of the carbapenem resistance in foodborneV. parahaemolyticus, a total of 13 strains harboring theblaNDM-1gene were subjected to long-reads Nanopore Sequencing. BLASTn analysis revealed that in 12 out of the 13 strains,blaNDM-1genes were located in IncC-type plasmids, indicating that theblaNDM-1gene was extensively distributed in seafood and aquatic products through transmission of IncC-type plasmids (Fig.1). However, in strain VP288, theblaNDM-1gene was found to be chromosomally located. We next determined how theblaNDM-1gene and the associated mobile elements were integrated into the backbone of IncC plasmids. Comparative analysis of the AMR region of such plasmids revealed a high degree of similarity with that ofAeromonas enteropelogenesstrain VA118; the genetic environment surrounding theblaNDM-1gene in strains VP288 and VA118 was nearly identical, with an ISCR1element being located downstream and flanked by twosul1genes (FigureS1). Linear sequence alignment of the 12blaNDM-1-bearing plasmids indicated that these plasmids could be categorized into four distinct groups (I–IV) on the basis of genetic variations in their genetic backbones (Figure S2). The plasmids pVP181-NDM (group I), pVP156-NDM and pVP209-NDM (group II), pVP148-NDM and pVP205-NDM (group III), and pVP228-NDM and pVP14-NDM (group IV) were selected as representative plasmids from each group for further comparative analysis. The linear sequence alignment of these IncC-type plasmids also revealed the presence of classical genes associated with replication (repA), partitioning (parABandstbA), transferability (traandtrh), and DNA metabolism (topB,dsbC,ssb,bet,exo,dcm3,nuc,pri,rhs1,int,yacC,krA,uvrD,acr12,acaCD) within the backbone of all seven complete plasmids. However, it was observed that the resistance-encoding regions exhibit a great variability among these plasmids (Fig.2,3,4, and5). The fundamental genetic characteristics of these seven plasmids are summarized in Table2.

The plasmid pVP181-NDM (group I) was identified to be the largest among the seven plasmids; BLASTn analysis against the NCBI database revealed that pVP181-NDM shared a remarkably high degree of genetic similarity with pHNAH8161B (CP104606) and P2-NDM-1 (OL348378). Notably, the plasmid pVP181-NDM harbored a resistance region of 38,277 bp, which was punctuated by six IS26elements that were known to facilitate the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (Liu et al.2022). Within this region, the class 1 integron In1021(Int1-aac(6′)-Ib-cr-ARR3-dfrA27-aadA16-sul1) was identified in pVP181-NDM. TheblaNDM-1gene was found located downstream of the ISCR1mobile element and was flanked by thecatB3,ARR-3,sul1, andChrAgenes, a configuration identical to that observed in other IncC-type plasmids such as pHNAH212861 (CP104923) inCitrobacter portucalensisand pC1-MCR-NDM (OL348380) inE. colistrains (Wang et al.2022). ThetnsA,tnsB,tnsC,tnsD, andtnsEgenes, which encode proteins essential for Tn7transposition, were inserted into the pVP181-NDM backbone flanked by two ISSheE3mobile elements, suggesting that the genomic region adjacent to the ISSheE3elements was a hot spot for Tn7transposon insertion (Fig.2).

The group II plasmid pVP156-NDM and pVP209-NDM was found to harbor two resistance regions, with one being 13,250 bp in length and the other one is theblaNDM-1-bearing region with a size of 28,375 bp and 25,430 bp, respectively. The first resistance-encoding region of the plasmid pVP156-NDM and pVP209-NDM harbors genes that confer resistance to chloramphenicol (floR), tetracycline (tet(A),tet(R)), aminoglycoside (strA,strB), and sulfonamide (sul2). Comparative analysis of the linear sequence of pVP156-NDM and pVP209-NDM indicated that the two plasmids exhibited a high degree of similarity with pKp55 (KY887594), which was recovered from anotherKlebsiella pneumoniaestrain, Kp55 (Fig.3). It should be noted that the resistance region harboringblaNDM-1gene exhibits a high degree of sequence variation among the plasmids pVb1282-tet, pVP156-NDM, pVP209-NDM, and pKp55. Specifically, the class I integron In469(intI-ARR-3-dfrA27-aadA16), In79(intI-qacE), and In1197(intI-blaIMP-26-aac(6′)-Ib-cr-catB3-sul1) were identified in pVb1282-tet, pVP156-NDM, and pKp55, respectively. However, the integron was not found in pVP209-NDM (Fig.3). TheblaNDM-1gene was bracketed by two copies of ISCR1insertion elements flanked by a 117 bp truncated ISAba125element; this finding strongly indicates that a preferential integration of theblaNDM-1gene into the IncC-type plasmid backbone and that this process is facilitated by the presence of the ISAba125and ISCR1elements.

The backbones of pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM (group III) shared a common resistance-encoding region of 13,250 bp. BLAST analysis indicated that pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM exhibited a high degree of similarity to pCf53 (KY887593), which was recovered from aCitrobacter freundiistrain Cf53 isolated from gulls in New South Wales, Australia (Papagiannitsis et al.2017), and to pVb2175 (OK067239) recovered from aVibrio alginolyticusstrain (Vb2175) isolated from shrimp samples in Shenzhen, China (Zheng et al.2022). Notably, both pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM harbored twoblaNDM-1genes flanked by three copies of ISCR1insertion elements oriented in the same direction. The genetic context surrounding theblaNDM-1gene in these plasmids differed markedly from that of pNDM2310 and p21OH12SH02B-1, which showed the highest sequence coverage with pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM. This highlights the structural heterogeneity of these plasmids and suggests that theblaNDM-1-carrying resistance region is relatively novel (Figure S3). As depicted in Fig.4, although pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM possess an IncC type backbone similar to that of plasmids pCf53 and pVb2175, their resistance profiles are remarkably different. The classical genetic context ofblaNDM-1gene in Tn125is present in pVb2175; however, thegroEL,groES,cutA, anddsbCgenes are notably absent in pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM, suggesting that these plasmids have undergone recombination events that altered their genetic architecture (Figure S4).

The group IV plasmid pVP228-NDM and pVP14-NDM demonstrated a remarkable genetic similarity with plasmid pCf75 found inCitrobacter freundiistrain L75 isolated from a urine sample in Guangzhou, China, and also with plasmid p1540-2 carried by anEscherichia colistrain CRE1540 isolated from a clinical rectal swab sample in Hong Kong (Fig.5) (Li et al.2020b). The plasmid pVP228-NDM contains a similar MDR region to that of pVP181-NDM, except that the orientation of the IS26-floR-IS26module was different (Figure S4). Plasmid pCf75 shared a highly similar backbone with pVP228-NDM but lacked a 13.4 kbp of the resistance module (IS26-aac(3′)-IId-IS26-ISCR1-floR-tet(A)-tet(R)-IS26-aph(3′)-Ia). Plasmid pVP14-NDM contained a backbone that was almost structurally identical to that of pCf75, except for the absence of theaac(6′)-Ib-crgene. Moreover, theblaNDM-1-encoding AMR regions in the seven plasmids were compared with the archetype of Tn125and plasmid pVb2175, which was previously characterized in our laboratory. The linear sequence maps revealed that the AMR regions harboring theblaNDM-1gene in these plasmids displayed marked differences from each other and that their genetic contexts were notably different from that observed in Tn125(Figure S4). These observations imply that the heterogeneity observed in the resistance regions is likely the result of complex interactions between various integrons, transposases, and mobile genetic elements, suggesting that multiple molecular mechanisms are responsible for driving the evolution of AMR inV. parahaemolyticus.

V. parahaemolyticusis a major cause of seafood-borne illnesses and therefore poses a considerable risk to food safety. The production of carbapenemase in bacteria has become an alarming public health issue as this enzyme renders bacterial pathogens resistant to the antibiotic of last resort, carbapenem. The emergence of NDM-producing strains ofV. parahaemolyticusfurther aggravates the public health threat posed by this pathogen. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance ofV. parahaemolyticusin seafood samples purchased from supermarkets and wet markets in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, during the period 2022–2023. Previous studies reported a prevalence ofV. parahaemolyticusof 14.17% in fish and 15.34% in shrimp samples collected from 15 provinces in China (Li et al.2020a). In addition, a previous study performed in our laboratory indicated an isolation rate ofV. parahaemolyticusin shrimp samples as high as 92% (Xu et al.2023). In the present study, the overall prevalence ofV. parahaemolyticusin seafood samples was 62.1%, with the highest isolation rate being observed in clams (90.5%). The high prevalence rates in razor clams (80.6%), shrimp (56.5%), abalone (50.0%), and other seafood samples (41.7%) also suggest that marine organisms are significant reservoirs ofV. parahaemolyticus. Furthermore, analysis of phenotypic resistance ofV. parahaemolyticusto antibiotics revealed that the rate of resistance to cefotaxime (71.3%) and meropenem (7.8%) was significantly higher than that previously reported (Xu et al.2023; Zheng et al.2022). The alarming detection rate of theblaNDM-1gene (5.6%) in this important pathogen indicates that this gene has been widely disseminated into popular seafood products and that drug-resistantV. parahaemolyticusinfections may become a common event.

Mobile carbapenemase genes are now commonly harbored by a number of bacterial pathogens recovered from clinical, animal, food, and environmental samples, yet they remain rare in foodborneV. parahaemolyticusstrains. Since the first identification ofblaNDM-1in India, this gene has been recovered from various species ofEnterobacterales,Acinetobacter, andPseudomonas, withKlebsiellaandE. colibeing the bacterial species from whichblaNDM-1is most frequently recovered (Kumarasamy et al.2010; Morris et al.2023). The firstblaNDM-1gene inVibriospp. was identified in twoVibrio choleraestrains isolated from waste seepage samples in India (Walsh et al.2011). Subsequently, theblaNDM-1gene has been detected inV. fluvialis(Chowdhury et al.2016),V. alginolyticus(Zheng et al.2018),V. vulnificus(Oyelade et al.2018),V. parahaemolyticus(Zheng et al.2022), and otherVibriospecies. The horizontal transfer ofblaNDM-1gene inEnterobacteralesspecies was mediated by multiple replicon types of plasmids, including IncF, IncX1, IncX3, IncX4, IncC, IncH, IncN, IncR, IncT, IncY, IncP, IncL/M, IncB/O/K/Z, and ColE10 (Wu et al.2019). However, inVibriospp., theblaNDM-1gene may be located in either the chromosome or in plasmids of the IncC incompatibility type (Gao et al.2023; Walsh et al.2011; Zheng et al.2018). In this study, we identified 13blaNDM-1-bearingV. parahaemolyticusstrains. In one of these strains, theblaNDM-1gene was located in the chromosome; in the remaining 12 strains, it was located in IncC-type plasmids. This finding was therefore consistent with that of previous studies (Chowdhury et al.2016; Gao et al.2023; Oyelade et al.2018; Walsh et al.2011; Zheng et al.2018) and suggests that the acquisition of theblaNDM-1gene inVibriospp. may occur through integration of the gene into chromosomes; this process may be facilitated by mobile elements or through mobilization of IncC-type plasmids. Our results, in conjunction with previous studies, confirm that the horizontal transfer ofblaNDM-1inVibriospp. is predominantly mediated by IncC-type plasmids.

The genetic context of theblaNDM-1gene harbored by IncC-type plasmids in this study exhibited significant variability, with the genetic backbones of the 12blaNDM-1-bearing plasmids being classified into four distinct groups. This observed diversity within the resistance regions underscores the complexity ofblaNDM-1-bearing plasmids and their potential impact on the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance-encoding elements inV. parahaemolyticus. Among the 12 plasmids, mobilization of theblaNDM-1gene was primarily associated with the ISCR1and IS26mobile genetic elements, which typically recruit adjacent DNA sequences to facilitate continual dissemination via a rolling-circle mechanism of transposition (Harmer and Hall2024; Wu et al.2019). It should be noted that two copies ofblaNDM-1genes flanked by three ISCR1elements were identified in plasmids pVP205-NDM and pVP148-NDM. Previous studies have demonstrated that the copy number of theblaNDM-1gene is influenced not only by the selection pressure of carbapenems but also by the replicon type ofblaNDM-1-bearing plasmids (Paul et al.2017). Given that the minimum inhibitory concentrations for VP205 and VP148 were both 16 μg/mL, it is plausible that the tandem repeats of theblaNDM-1gene emerged during bacterial culture in liquid broth medium supplemented with meropenem. The results of linear sequence alignment of the four groups ofblaNDM-1-bearing plasmids in the present study indicate that the IncC-type plasmids in foodborneV. parahaemolyticusexhibited high-level similarity to multiple IncC-type plasmids recovered fromKlebsiella pneumoniae,Citrobacter freundii,E. coli,V. alginolyticus, andV. parahaemolyticusstrains collected in various locations worldwide. This finding further suggests that extensive genetic exchange and rapid transmission of theblaNDM-1gene between different bacterial species frequently occur. However, the precise transmission trajectory, evolutionary routes, and molecular mechanisms underlying the horizontal transfer of theblaNDM-1gene in foodborneV. parahaemolyticuswarrant further investigation.

In conclusion, this study has delineated the prevalence and molecular epidemiological features ofV. parahaemolyticusisolates from seafood samples in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. We performed comprehensive characterization of the complete genetic architecture of four groups ofblaNDM-1-bearing plasmids recoverable fromV. parahaemolyticusand found that each exhibited a unique resistance region. Alarmingly, the rate of resistance of foodborneV. parahaemolyticusstrains to carbapenems has increased to concerning levels, posing a significant threat to public health. These findings suggest a necessity to develop and implement effective strategies to prevent contamination and spread ofVibriospp. strains in food samples. Furthermore, we envisage an urgent need for continuous and effective surveillance measures to monitor and control the horizontal transfer of multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmids among strains of theVibriospecies.
