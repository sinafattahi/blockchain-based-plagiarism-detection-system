Chagas disease, caused by the protozoanTrypanosoma cruzi, is a significant challenge for canine health, with limited diagnostic tools. This study assessed the performance of a novel Tc‐24 recombinant antigen ELISA compared to three commercial diagnostic tests on 70 serum samples from kennel dogs in Texas. The Tc‐24 ELISA demonstrated high sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity (91.2%) compared to Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) testing, with significant differences in Tc‐24 optical density (OD) between positives and negatives (0.607 vs. 0.089,p< 0.001). When compared to Chagas Stat‐Pak (SP), Tc‐24 ELISA showed sensitivity and specificity values of 82.1% and 86.7%, respectively (p< 0.001). For Chagas Detect Plus (IB), the assay achieved a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 93.1% (p< 0.001). Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant associations between Tc‐24 OD and SP (r= 1.0,p= 0.0167), IB (r= 0.9,p= 0.0833) and IFA (r= 0.6273,p= 0.044). Elevated immunochromatographic values in commercial kits (SP or IB) correlated with Tc‐24 OD (1.17 vs. 0.039,p< 0.001), achieving 100% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity based on positive results from commercial kits. These findings suggest that Tc‐24 ELISA is a reliable and accurate serological tool for diagnosingT. cruziinfection in dogs, with the potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities in veterinary medicine.

Dogs are major reservoirs ofTrypanosoma cruziin Texas, United States. This study evaluated a novel Tc‐24 recombinant antigen ELISA for the serologic detection of Chagas disease in dogs and found it to have high sensitivity and specificity compared to existing commercial tests. The Tc‐24 Chagas ELISA provides a reliable tool for enhanced canine Chagas surveillance and diagnosis.

Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an infectious tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi(Alvarez‐Hernandez et al.2021).T. cruziinfections in humans and other mammalian hosts, including dogs, can occur via congenital transmission, blood transfusions/organ transplants, contact with infected triatomine feces, or ingesting an infected triatomine insect vector (Alvarez‐Hernandez et al.2021). It is endemic to 21 countries across South and Central America, Mexico, and the southern United States (Browne et al.2017). In humans, the diagnosis of chronic infection relies solely on serological tests. The diagnostic gold standard for diagnosing human patients with suspected chronicT. cruziinfection is the combination of two positive serological tests (enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay [Adam et al.2017; Ascanio et al.2024], hemagglutination inhibition assay [HAI] or indirect immunofluorescence [IIF]) and potentially a third test if the results are conflicting (Alvarez‐Hernandez et al.2021). However, existing serological tests for Chagas disease are prone to inconclusive results and exhibit poor concordance between different assay formats. A recent study showed that the performance of three commercialT. cruziserological tests varied when detecting differentT. cruzistrains, including 12% missed cases from Argentina, 21% missed cases from Honduras, and 72% missed cases from Mexico (Truyens et al.2021). These differences exist in both human and canine testing. Dogs are a known reservoir forT. cruziacross various endemic areas, particularly the southern United States, including Texas, where infection prevalence between 20.3% and 31.6% and as high as 57.6% have been documented in domestic dogs and kennel environments, respectively (Busselman et al.2021; Kjos et al.2008). There are limited immunodiagnostic tests specific for veterinary use. However, research in Chagas testing for dogs and cats is ongoing (Alvarez‐Hernandez et al.2021; Fontes et al.2024; Rodrigues et al.2022). Therefore, many epidemiological studies in domestic and wild animal reservoirs rely on an Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) test, often used in tandem with commercial immunodiagnostic tests approved and intended for use on human samples (Rodriguez et al.2023).

A concern surrounding diagnostics ofT. cruziinfection is that different tests may perform differently in humans or animals infected with the seven known discrete typing units (Margioto Teston et al.2016) and can potentially cross‐react with related protozoans that may be co‐endemic/or co‐occur (e.g.,Leishmaniaspecies) (Caballero et al.2007). Our study aims to compare the performance of a novel Tc‐24 recombinant antigen ELISA to three commercial diagnostic tests for dogs from Texas. Tc‐24 is a 24 kDa calcium‐binding protein expressed in all life stages ofT. cruzi(Arnal et al.2020). It is an immunodominant protein during infection and conserved across all geographical strains ofT. cruzi, with a 97% sequence homology across geographic strains, and it is not present in species ofLeishmania(Maldonado et al.1997). Therefore, it has been hypothesised that it can detect antibodies induced by all strains ofT. cruzi, while not generating false‐positive results due to cross‐reactivity withLeishmaniaspecies. Another potential benefit of the Tc‐24 canine ELISA is its potential for widespread use in centralised veterinary laboratories without requiring specialised equipment besides a standard plate spectrophotometer. The cost of the recombinant Tc‐24 antigen and reagents is minimal, especially since they are used in small quantities (Protocol S1). In addition, there are economic benefits in diagnosing Chagas disease early, especially using a single Tc‐24 ELISA compared to 2 or more commercially available kits (Bartsch et al.2018).

All samples were collected from privately owned animals in accordance with protocols approved by the Texas A&M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Clinical Research Review Committee (Protocol No. 2018–0460 CA).

Our study examined dogs in ten large kennels in South Texas. The dogs were sampled up to three times each between May 2018 and September 2019 to initially collect data for a study to quantify the incidence of canineT. cruziinfections, Protocol IACUC 2018‐0460 CA (Busselman et al.2021). This study included a convenience sample of 70 randomly selected dogs enrolled in an original study and not preselected for Chagas positivity. The selected dogs were either male or female, with ages ranging from 13 months to 12.2 years (mean = 6.1 years; median = 6.1 years). Various breeds were represented, including hound dogs, Belgian Malinois, German shorthair pointers, Labrador retrievers, Brittany spaniels, and English pointers (Busselman et al.2021). Each blood sample collected approximately 5 mL of blood in an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tube and 4 mL in a clotting tube and kept frozen at ‐80°C until processing (Rodriguez et al.2023).

As previously reported (Busselman et al.2021), serum samples were tested forT.cruziantibodies using three serological tests: Chagas Stat‐Pak (‘SP’; ChemBio, Medford, NY, USA), Chagas Detect Plus Rapid Test (‘IB’; InBios International, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA), and an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. The Chagas Stat‐Pak and Chagas Detect Plus are rapid tests that, while not labelled nor FDA‐approved for use in dogs, are commonly used for research purposes to detectT.cruziantibodies (Nieto et al.2009; Dumonteil et al.2020; Barbabosa‐Pliego et al.2009). The three commercial tests were selected from a previous study to evaluate rapid tests for canine Chagas disease (Rodriguez et al.2023). For the current study, the strength of the response on the rapid tests was scored on a scale from 0 to 4, in which 0 was a negative result (i.e., no colour development or when a very faint incomplete band developed) and scores of 1–4 were positive results with increasing intensity of the reaction line. The IFA was run at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory with endpoint titres determined. Both the IFA and Tc‐24 ELISA produced a quantitative result.

A Tc‐24 recombinant antigen ELISA protocol was previously used to detect anti‐T. cruziantibodies in human samples were adapted for canine samples (Singampalli et al.2025). The ELISA protocol for detecting Tc24 in canine serum samples is described as follows: Flat‐bottom 96‐well Immulon 4 microtitre plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) are coated with Tc24 antigen at a concentration of 0.125 µg/mL in a coating buffer (100 µL per well) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plates are then washed four times using an ELISA washer with PBS‐Tween (0.5%), followed by blocking each well with 200 µL of blocking buffer containing 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The plates are incubated at 37°C for 1 h and washed four times. Canine serum samples were diluted at 1:200 in ELISA diluent and added to the wells in triplicate (100 µL per well). The plates are incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by four washes. A secondary antibody, rabbit anti‐canine, Fc fragment, conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, is diluted to 1:2500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and added at 100 µL per well. After another 1‐h incubation at 37°C, the plates are washed four times. For the detection step, 100 µL of substrate solution (prepared by dissolving one alkaline phosphatase substrate tablet (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) in 5 mL sodium carbonate buffer) is added to each well. The plates are read at 405–410 nm wavelengths after a 30‐min reaction time using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT), and results are analysed with SoftMax Pro 7 software (detailed ELISA protocol inProtocol S1).

The Tc‐24 ELISA was compared to each commercial test to determine a positive result. The SP threshold of positivity determined by the ROC curve was 0.156 OD (Sensitivity 82.1%, Specificity 86.7%). The threshold of positivity for IFA determined by the ROC curve was 0.198 OD (Sensitivity 87.5%, Specificity 91.2%). The threshold of positivity for IB determined by the ROC curve was 0.198 OD (Sensitivity 80.0%, Specificity 93.1%) (Figure1).

(A) SP positives had higher Tc‐24 OD than SP negatives (0.475 vs. 0.098,p< 0.001). The threshold of positivity determined by the ROC curve was 0.156 OD (Sensitivity 82.1%, Specificity 86.7%). (B) IFA positives had higher Tc‐24 OD than IFA negatives (0.607 vs. 0.089,p< 0.001). The threshold of positivity determined by the ROC curve was 0.198 OD (Sensitivity 87.5%, Specificity 91.2%). (C) IB positives had higher Tc‐24 OD than IB negatives (0.482 vs. 0.091,p< 0.001). The threshold of positivity determined by the ROC curve was 0.198 OD (Sensitivity 80.0%, Specificity 93.1%).

Results were compared using Mann‐Whitney tests for nonparametric variables. Spearman correlation tests were used to determine relationships between continuous variables. Analysis of covariance was utilised to compare linear correlations. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a binary classification test comparing Tc‐24 ELISA to commercial tests. ROC curves were calculated using the Wilson/Brown method.p< 0.05 was considered significant. These tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.2.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).

Comparing individual tests to Tc‐24 ELISA resulted in SP positives having higher means of Tc‐24 Optical Density (OD) than SP negatives (0.475 vs. 0.098,p< 0.001) (Sensitivity 82.1%, Specificity 86.7%) (Figure1A). IFA positives had higher means of Tc‐24 OD than IFA negatives (0.607 vs. 0.089,p< 0.001) (Sensitivity 87.5%, Specificity 91.2%) (Figure1B). IB positives had higher means of Tc‐24 OD than IB negatives (0.482 vs. 0.091,p< 0.001) (Sensitivity 80.0%, Specificity 93.1%) (Figure1C). SP results had an association with Tc‐24 (p< 0.001) and a correlation of Spearmanr= 1.0 (p= 0.0167), with higher SP values (Alvarez‐Hernandez et al.2021; Browne et al.2017; Adam et al.2017; Ascanio et al.2024) associated with higher Tc‐24 results (Figure2A). There was an association of IFA to Tc‐24 (p< 0.001) and a correlation of Spearmanr= 0.6273 (p= 0.044) (Figure2B). The IB strips compared to Tc‐24 also showed an association with Tc‐24 (p< 0.001) and a non‐significant correlation of Spearmanr= 0.9 (p= 0.0833) (Figure2C). A comparison of all three positive commercial tests to the Tc‐24 ELISA showed an association between positive versus negative results (p< 0.0001) with 82.5% sensitivity and 89.7% specificity (FigureS1). Comparing the highest IFA titres (>1280) of this study to Tc‐24 (OD) resulted in (1.0 vs. 0.089,p< 0.001) and 100% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity (Figure3A). Similarly, comparing high (SP, IB) immunochromatographic values (Ascanio et al.2024) to Tc‐24 (OD) revealed (1.17 vs. 0.039,p< 0.001) and 100% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity (Figure3B). Similar results were seen when converting data to Samples OD/Cut off OD for the respective commercial kit, and raw data is reported in TableS1.

(A) Tc‐24 correlates to the increasing intensity of bands on the SP commercial test (Spearmanr= 1.00,p= 0.0167), and all groups were significantly different (ANOVA,p< 0.001). (B) Tc‐24 correlates to increasing titre on IFA commercial testing (Spearmanr= 0.6273,p= 0.0440), and all groups were significantly different (ANOVA,p< 0.0001). (C) Tc‐24 correlates to the increasing intensity of bands on IB commercial testing (Spearmanr= 0.9,p= 0.0833), and all groups were significantly different (ANOVA,p< 0.001).

(A) Comparing high (SP, IB) immunochromatographic values (Ascanio et al.2024) to Tc‐24 (OD) revealed (1.17 vs. 0.039,p< 0.001) and 100% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity. (B) Comparing the highest IFA titres (>1280) of this study to Tc‐24 (OD) resulted in (1.0 vs. 0.089,p< 0.001) and 100% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity.

Diagnosing Chagas disease in dogs is challenging due toT. cruzibiology, chronicity of infection, and fluctuations in parasitaemia throughout an infection (Balouz et al.2017). Efforts to improve the detection ofT. cruziinfections in companion animals are underway; for instance, the same archival canine serum validated a multiplex microsphere immunoassay with promising results from a single assay (Rodriguez et al.2023). However, this approach requires using the Luminex platform, which may not be readily available in many veterinary diagnostic laboratories. As for cross‐reactivity ofLeishmaniaandT. cruziantigens, only three canine serum samples were Chagas positive by two commercial tests and leishmaniasis positive by K39 (Kinesin‐like protein, partial) (Rodriguez et al.2023). The mean OD Tc‐24 for the infected dogs was significantly higher than dogs that were Chagas negative by commercial kits andLeishmaniaantigen negative (0.624 vs. 0.0912,p= 0.0014, respectively) (FigureS2), but not being significantly different than dogs that are Chagas positive andLeishmanianegative (0.472,p= 0.809). While leishmaniasis may elevate Tc‐24 levels, our results may show no significant increase in Tc‐24 OD when co‐infected withLeishmania. Leishmaniasis is an emerging canine infection in Texas, and the ability to differentiate the diseases is important for overall canine health (Petersen2009).

The results showed that SP and IB strips had an association and high correlation to Tc‐24 ELISA. While the IB correlation wasP= 0.0833 and not significant, this suggests a trend towards significance but does not meet the criteria in this small sample size study. IFA also showed a significant association and moderate correlation to Tc‐24 ELISA.

Moreover, comparing any two positive commercial tests to the Tc‐24 ELISA revealed a higher sensitivity and specificity than a single commercial test. Comparing high IFA titres and high immunochromatographic values to positive Tc‐24 showed high sensitivity and specificity. These results indicate that Tc‐24 ELISA may have the potential to be a new serological assay to diagnoseT. cruziinfection in dogs.

While this study provides promising results, several limitations need to be addressed. Firstly, the study had a small sample size, and the results must be replicated in larger studies. Serological results inherently indicate antibody presence, which can reflect exposure rather than an active infection. Importantly, this study does not address whether a positive serologic result definitively confirms active disease or whether a negative result rules it out, as it primarily compares the Tc‐24 ELISA to other serologic tests rather than a definitive diagnostic standard such as PCR or histopathological analysis. This approach risks propagating potential inaccuracies if multiple serologic tests yield concordant but erroneous results. Additionally, the samples utilised in this study were collected exclusively from kennel dogs in Texas without independent confirmation of infection status through parasite isolation or molecular diagnostics. Even in neighbouring states, including Louisiana, the DTU, including TcII and TcVI, may differ from TexasT. cruzidiversity (Dumonteil et al.2020). This creates a gap in validating the accuracy of the Tc‐24 ELISA and its comparisons, emphasizing the need for future studies incorporating a more diverse sample set and rigorous confirmation methods to mitigate these limitations. Other confounding factors, including breed, age, or health status, were used as covariates in this analysis. Lastly, the subjective grading of immunochromatographic tests may have introduced potential bias in the results and can lead to false negatives or positives based on observer bias. It can grossly overfit the comparison to Tc‐24 results, reducing its validity.

Chagas disease, caused byT. cruzi, is a neglected tropical disease with significant global health implications. The infection progresses through an acute phase, often asymptomatic, and a chronic phase, which can lead to severe cardiac and gastrointestinal complications. As key reservoirs, dogs are pivotal in the transmission cycle, particularly in endemic regions such as South and Central America, Mexico, and the southern US. A timely and accurate diagnosis is essential to managing and reducing clinical impacts on canines and humans.

Chagas disease diagnosis in dogs is challenging due to the limitations of existing serological tests. This study suggests that Tc‐24 recombinant antigen ELISA has potential as a new serological assay to aid in diagnosingT. cruziinfection in dogs with a single test. These findings have implications as early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to preventing the development of chronic disease, reducing transmission, and broadening epidemiological surveillance in endemic areas. While this study used a Tc24 antigen conserved in all knownT. cruzistrains, this pilot study has only used canine samples from Texas, USA, which precludes extrapolating its usefulness in other geographic regions.
