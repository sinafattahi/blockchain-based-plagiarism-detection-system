Temporal summation (TS) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) are impaired in many chronic pain individuals, although typical TS and CPM responses remain unclear. Providing a quantile distribution of TS and CPM values could help determine whether TS and CPM responses fall outside the usual ranges, thereby informing pain management strategies. The objective of this study was to provide a response distribution for these mechanisms in a large, pain‐free cohort.

Pain‐free participants (n= 347) were evaluated. TS was interpreted as the change in pain perception scores during a constant heat pain stimulus. CPM was assessed by the difference in pain perception scores induced by a tonic heat pain stimulus and a mechanical pain threshold, before and after a cold pressor test (CPT). Quantile regression was performed to identify the 5th to 95th percentiles, with a specific focus on the 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles and their confidence intervals, while considering age and sex.

Analyses revealed a particularly large range of TS and CPM responses, spanning from strong inhibition in CPM and strong summation in TS to moderate or even null effects. Notably, some responses deviated from the expected patterns, with certain individuals exhibiting hyperalgesic CPM effects and others displaying hypoalgesic TS responses. The highest percentiles of the TS distribution were influenced by age and gender, while CPM scores remained unchanged.

The results of this study provide an overview of the possible spectra of responses for TS and CPM, potentially paving the way for their incorporation into pain management strategies.

This study examines the spectrum and provides a distribution for TS and CPM values to better identify what may constitute a deficit in these mechanisms and enhance their clinical interpretation.

Nociceptive information can be modulated by endogenous excitatory and inhibitory pain modulation systems located at various sites within the nervous system (Chen et al.2018; Kucharczyk et al.2022; Marchand2017). These mechanisms have been linked to certain phenomena and psychophysical measures, such as temporal summation (TS) (Mendell2022), which reflects excitatory mechanisms, and conditioned pain modulation (CPM), which reflects inhibitory mechanisms (Ramaswamy and Wodehouse2021; Sirucek et al.2023).

Compared to pain‐free individuals, increased TS (Giesecke et al.2004; Staud et al.2001) and/or weak CPM responses (Fernandes et al.2019) have been observed in a number of pain conditions, suggesting that deficits in the endogenous pain modulation system may play a role in the development and pathogenesis of these conditions (Yarnitsky2015). Some studies suggest that this information could be used clinically to tailor treatments to the condition of each patient, for example by using ketamine for those with abnormal TS (Bosma et al.2018) and duloxetine for those with CPM deficits (Edwards et al.2016; Yarnitsky et al.2012).

The idea that the therapeutic management of chronic pain could be improved by identifying the underlying deficits in pain modulation mechanisms has gained increased attention in recent years (Kisler et al.2019; Yarnitsky2015). For clinicians, however, one key question remains: what constitutes the spectrum of typical TS and CPM responses? Despite extensive investigation, few have included enough participants to answer this question and comprehensively examine pain modulation mechanisms while accounting for age and sex. Among the commendable exceptions, the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) group made significant contributions to the field by recruiting nearly 180 participants and developing normative quantitative sensory testing (QST) values, including the wind‐up ratio (Rolke et al.2006). Unfortunately, CPM responses were not measured.

Subsequent studies have documented CPM responses using various protocols and stimuli (Graven‐Nielsen et al.2015; Kennedy et al.2020; Locke et al.2014). While these efforts are commendable, they have been constrained by relatively small sample sizes (< 150 participants). Another study, conducted by Schliessbach et al., presented data distribution for CPM only and estimated percentiles (Schliessbach et al.2019) on a cohort of 146 healthy participants. However, this study reported only the lowest percentiles, limiting its utility for identifying abnormally high values and estimating the whole spectrum of responses.

The objective of this study was to expand on and complement these previous findings by exploring the distribution of responses for endogenous pain modulation mechanisms using a large sample of pain‐free individuals. To this end, distributions for TS, CPM combined with mechanical and thermal pain threshold were presented from the 5th to the 95th percentiles using an experimental continuous tonic heat pain as test stimuli and cold‐water bath as a conditioning stimulus. Although several methods exist for assessing these mechanisms, this experimental approach was chosen for its ability to estimate both TS and CPM in a single session. Particular attention was given to the highest percentiles, as these could indicate potentially atypical responses for both CPM and TS.

This cross‐sectional study was conducted at the Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada), between November 2017 and March 2022, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the International Council for Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practices. Ethics approval was granted by the institutional review board of theCentre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de l'Estrie–Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CIUSSS de l'Estrie–CHUS), Sherbrooke, Canada. Participants' eligibility was confirmed, and informed consent was obtained prior to the beginning of the study.

Testing was conducted during a single experimental session. Participants were recruited using a non‐probability method combined with quota sampling to ensure representation across subgroups defined by sex (female, male) and age (18–39; 40–59 and 60–79 years). The subgroups were recruited simultaneously, in parallel. Participants had to meet the following eligibility criteria (self‐reported). Inclusion criteria: (1) 18–79 years of age, (2) able to understand instructions (French or English), (3) free from any chronic pain condition(s) and (4) pain‐free (e.g., no acute injury) on the day of testing. Exclusion criteria: (1) acute or chronic arm injury (including impaired sensitivity), (2) pregnancy or post‐partum (< 1 year) status, (3) active cancer or cancer‐related pain, (4) cardiac or vascular diseases, (5) history of psychotic or neurocognitive disorder and (6) regular use of recreational substances. Within the 24 h preceding the experimental visit, participants were asked to abstain from consuming tobacco (Ditre et al.2017; Shi et al.2020), alcohol (Horn‐Hofmann et al.2015,2019), caffeine (Baratloo et al.2016), and pain medication. Recreational substances were also prohibited up to 7 days before testing. If a participant did not follow these requirements, the session was rescheduled. Participants were recruited through social media advertisements, posters, and leaflets. Those who were interested were invited to contact the research team by filling out an online screening questionnaire to confirm their eligibility.

The assessment of TS and CPM was carried out according to a counter‐irritation protocol, in which a test stimulus was applied before and after a conditioning stimulus (Tousignant‐Laflamme et al.2008). Testing sessions were carried out in a quiet and temperature‐controlled room, with the participants in a comfortable seated position. Participants were familiarised with the testing environment for a period of ~30 min prior to testing. Trained research assistants administered the tests under the supervision of the principal investigator, adhering to strict procedural standards to minimise variability between testers. Figure1illustrates the step‐by‐step timeline of the procedure.

Pain perception was continuously recorded with a computerised visual analog scale, or CoVAS, consisting of a slider running along a 100 mm horizontal track housed in a box. Participants were asked to rate their pain by moving the slider between the left boundary (identified as ‘no pain’—score = 0) and the right boundary (identified as ‘maximum you can tolerate’—score = 100). We also included a numerical scale above the slider to give participants reference points.

A thermode (TSA II, Thermal Sensory Analyser, Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel), starting at a baseline of 32°C and increasing at a rate of 0.3°C per second, was applied to the right forearm three times. Participants were instructed to move the cursor from its initial position (0: absence of pain) to the right as soon as they perceived the first sensation of pain (Defrin et al.2006; Rolke et al.2006) (defined as their heat pain threshold [HPT]) and to continuously indicate their pain perception until they reached the right extremity of the numerical scale (100: maximum tolerance–heat pain tolerance). The average temperature across the three pre‐tests was used to determine their average HPT. We also determined the average temperature required to induce pain in each participant, as indicated by a measure of around 50/100 (target temperature–T50) on the numerical scale, which we noted for later use as the test stimulus.

As recommended (Yarnitsky et al.2015), two test stimuli (heat pain stimulus and mechanical pain stimulus) were used to assess CPM. The heat pain stimulus consisted of a painful thermal stimulation applied with a thermode on the left forearm, at a predetermined, individually tailored temperature (T50 based on pretests). Participants were told that the thermode temperature could randomly increase, remain stable, or decrease throughout the stimulation, to avoid them developing specific expectations. In reality, after a constant rise (0.3°C/s) from baseline (32°C) to the predetermined temperature (pain levels of 50/100 based on pretests data), the temperature remained constant over the next 120 s. Participants were asked to continuously record their pain level using the CoVAS. The mechanical pain stimulus consisted of a gradually increasing pressure (around 0.45 Kg/s) to the upper left trapezius using a digital algometer (Jtech Medical, Midvale, Utah, USA) until the participant verbally reported reaching the early first sensation of pressure pain (pressure pain threshold [PPT]). The mechanical and thermal test stimuli were again administered under the same conditions as the first one.

The conditioning stimulus consisted of a cold pressor test (CPT), wherein the participants immersed their right forearm in a temperature‐controlled cold‐water bath set at 10°C for 120 s. This temperature was chosen because it has been shown to be sufficiently painful to induce a CPM effect while still being tolerable for participants (Coulombe‐Lévêque et al.2021; Nuwailati et al.2022). A continuous water circulation system was activated during the entire stimulation period to ensure water temperature homogeneity. During the CPT, participants were asked to continuously rate the intensity of their pain using the CoVAS. These scores were used to calculate the average pain evoked by the conditioning stimulus and to ensure that a sensation of pain has been induced.

The amplitude of TS was determined with the thermal test stimulus by evaluating pain fluctuations prior to the conditioning stimulus. We calculated TS amplitude by measuring the difference in pain intensity between the end of the stimulation and the moment when the thermode reached its target temperature. A positive score indicated an increase in pain perception and was interpreted as the presence of the TS phenomenon. A negative score or a score equal to 0 was interpreted as the absence of the TS phenomenon. The CPM amplitude was determined by comparing the pain levels before and after the conditioning stimulus, induced by both thermal (difference in maximum perceived pain level–CPM‐peak pain) and mechanical (difference in PPT–CPM‐PPT) test stimuli. We subtracted the post‐water immersion pain from the pre‐water immersion pain, so that a negative score was interpreted as indicative of hypoalgesia (CPM effect) for both thermal stimulation and PPTs. The decision to use two types of TS is based on recommendations from the expert group of Yarnitsky et al. (2015), which advocates for the use of different types of TS—including thermal and mechanical—to enhance CPM assessment (Yarnitsky et al.2015).

We conducted descriptive analyses for TS and CPM outcomes, as well as for HPT and PPT, to provide a comprehensive overview of the data. These analyses included mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range) and range (minimum–maximum). We also estimated the proportions of participants showing an increase, a decrease, or no change in TS and CPM responses.

To have a better understanding of ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’ values of TS and CPM, we looked at their probability density curves to characterise data distribution. Within a particular range of values, the area under the curve specifies the probability of the variable of interest to be within that range. The area under the entire density curve corresponds to a probability of 1 (100%). Our approach proposed to estimate TS and CPM underlying our probability density function using a kernel density estimator for these curves, offering more flexibility and the absence of restrictive assumptions (Chen2017; Li and Racine2007; Silverman2017). Since kernel‐based procedures require the choice of a kernel function and a bandwidth parameter (Li and Racine2007), we used the Epanechnikov kernel and the data‐driven likelihood cross‐validation selection method, respectively, as recommended for all of our kernel‐based estimations (Horne and Garton2006; Li and Racine2007).

Quantile estimations were performed by computing the 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles via quantile regression (Schliessbach et al.2019) based on the empirical distribution function. Bootstrapped confidence intervals based on 10,000 replications were computed for both percentiles. All of these procedures were computed for each TS and CPM outcome on the overall sample and subsamples derived from stratification by sex (female and male) and by age group (18–39; 40–59 and 60–79 years old). We defined these three age categories for stratification according to a recent meta‐analysis on the effect of age on TS and CPM (Hackett et al.2020; Schliessbach et al.2019). For a complete overview of the percentile distribution, we also estimated the 5th, 10th, 15th, 25th, 50th and 85th percentiles (see TablesS1–S3). Differences between subgroups were considered statistically significant when the confidence intervals did not overlap between subgroups. As comparison tests between extreme percentiles can be hazardous, we chose this method even if it is portrayed as rather conservative. Quantile regression was performed using open‐source software and programming language R. Graphical representation was performed using Python language within MATLAB software.

Of the 367 participants recruited and tested, 20 were excluded from the analyses (see flowchart Figure2), leaving 347 data points available for the TS analyses. Of the remaining 347 participants, four were excluded for the CPM‐HPS, and two were excluded from the CPM‐PPT, both due to technical issues. The participants' characteristics are presented in Table1.

Quantile estimates and descriptive analyses for TS are presented in Table2. Overall distribution (see TableS1) for TS ranged from −52.2 (95% CI: −58.4 to −45.3) to 55.7 (95% CI: 46.7–62.0). For sex, the 95% CIs did not overlap for C90and C95, indicating differences between sexes. For theses percentiles, the associated TS values were higher for women than for men. Concerning age, the 95% CIs did not overlap for C75and C90, indicating a significant difference between the youngest and oldest groups. For this percentile, TS values were higher for the oldest group compared to the youngest group (see Figure3).

Overall distribution for CPM‐HPS (see TableS2) ranged from −36.7 (95% CI: −42.0 to −31.8) to 17.2 (95% CI: 15.0–20.7). Quantile estimates for the highest values (very ineffective CPM) and descriptive analyses for CPM‐HPS are presented in Table3. The 95% CIs overlapped for all subgroup comparisons, indicating the absence of differences between males and females, and between age groups for C75, C90and C95.

Overall distribution for CPM‐PPT (see TableS2) ranged from −1.8 (95% CI: −2.2 to −1.3) to 4.5 (95% CI: 3.8–5.0). Quantile estimates for the highest values (very ineffective CPM) and descriptive analyses for CPM‐HPS are presented in Table3. The 95% CIs overlapped for all subgroup comparisons, indicating no differences between males and females, as well as between the three age groups for C75, C90and C95. The overlap between males and females for C75was, however, particularly small.

Overall distribution for HPT (see TableS3) ranged from 34.1 (95% CI: 33.9–34.6) to 45.8 (95% CI: 45.3–46.4). Quantile estimates for the highest values and descriptive analyses for HPT and PPT are presented in Table4. The 95% CIs overlapped for all subgroup comparisons, indicating no differences between males and females or among the three age groups for C75, C90and C95.

For PPT, the overall distribution (see TableS3) ranged from 4.3 (95% CI: 3.8–4.7) to 14.4 (95% CI: 13.7–15.5). Concerning the highest values, the non‐overlapping 95% CIs for C75and C90for males and females revealed a significant sex difference. For these percentiles, the associated PPT values were higher for males than for females. For age, the 95% CIs did not overlap for C90, indicating a significant difference between (i) the youngest and middle‐age group and (ii) the youngest and oldest group. For this percentile, the associated PPT values were lower for the youngest group compared to the middle‐age and oldest group (see Figure4).

This study aimed at determining the distribution of responses for TS, CPM, HPT and PPT using dynamic QST with 347 pain‐free participants. TS was induced using a continuous thermal stimulation, while CPM was measured with thermal and mechanical stimulation as test stimuli and a cold‐water bath as the conditioning stimulus. The response spectra were identified using quantile regression based on the empirical distribution function using percentiles, focusing on the highest percentiles (75th, 90th and 95th) to better identify typical and atypical responses.

Few studies have provided data on the distribution of TS values. Our results showed that a half of our participants exhibited a TS phenomenon. It is possible that the use of continuous thermal stimulation may have favoured a habituation phenomenon and could explain why TS was observed in only half of our participants. Still, it is important to note that other studies usingphasicheat pain tests also reveal that TS is absent in a significant number of individuals (Anderson et al.2013; Geisser2013; Kell et al.2024; Rhudy et al.2020; Staud et al.2014). In one of these studies, conducted on a similar population to ours but using a phasic stimulation (Anderson et al.2013), the authors found that approximately 29% of the sample exhibited a TS phenomenon. The remaining participants showed either no change (59%) or decreased pain perception (12%) during the TS paradigm, which aligns with our observations. Similar findings using a different TS paradigm (Granot et al.2006) and different populations (Ocay et al.2022; Raphael et al.2009) were observed. Altogether, these observations suggest that TS may not be a universal phenomenon observed consistently in all individuals (Geisser2013; Kell et al.2024).

Our results revealed the presence of differences between males and females for TS, with females showing higher TS responses at the same percentile compared to males, suggesting a more antinociceptive profile in males (Awali et al.2018; Robinson et al.2004; Sarlani et al.2004). We also observed significant differences for TS0‐120 values across age groups, suggesting greater facilitation in older individuals, which again aligns with findings from a recent meta‐analysis (Hackett et al.2020). It would now be valuable to compare the distributions of TS responses obtained with our protocol to those from a phasic stimulation protocol, using a sample of similar size, sex distribution and age range.

For CPM, our results showed a broad range of responses, suggesting that CPM responses also vary greatly between individuals. Similar findings have been reported by other authors using mechanical and electrical test stimuli (Schliessbach et al.2019). While intriguing, the presence of both hyperalgesic and hypoalgesic responses following the application of the conditioning stimulus is not surprising. Our distribution reveals that only three‐quarters of individuals exhibited hypoalgesia, regardless of the method of stimulation used (mechanical and thermal confounded). These findings are consistent with those of other studies using pressure and thermal pain stimulation (El‐Sayed et al.2021; Ibancos‐Losada et al.2020; Ocay et al.2022). The effect of sex on CPM amplitude is inconsistent, with some studies suggesting that males exhibit stronger inhibitory mechanisms than females (Bulls et al.2015; Popescu et al.2010; Riley et al.2020), and others showing that there are no differences in CPM responses between men and women (Schliessbach et al.2019). In our study, quantile estimates showed no significant differences between sexes for CPM‐HPS and only slight differences for CPM‐PPT, in line with the findings of Grashorn et al. (2013) and Khan et al. (2018).

Age is another factor that has been shown to influence CPM responses, with older individuals typically showing lower CPM than younger individuals (Hackett et al.2020; van der Meulen et al.2024), although one study found no age‐related effects (Skovbjerg et al.2017). Splitting age into three categories may have hindered our ability to detect age differences. Although some of our results differ from what has been observed in other studies—notably the absence of differences between males and females and between age groups for CPM—it is important to note that findings identifying differences in participant‐related factors like age and sex on TS and CPM (based on mean differences) may not necessarily apply to observations at quantile level.

For HPT, neither sex nor age had any impact on quantile estimates. The average HPT appeared to be lower than those reported in other studies with similar populations (Neziri et al.2011; Rolke et al.2006) with a significant proportion of participants reporting HPT below 40°C. Although the same equipment was used, our assessment protocol differed from others, for example, in the rate of temperature rise, which could potentially affect pain threshold measurements.

For PPT, males had higher pain threshold values, indicating that a stronger stimulus was required to induce pain compared to females. This is consistent with past observation (Neziri et al.2011). With regard to age, the results of previous studies are contradictory, with some showing a reduction (Petrini et al.2015) and others an increase (González‐Roldán et al.2020) in PPT. There is no strong evidence that ageing reduces pain sensitivity, particularly for perception thresholds (Cámara et al.2020; Lautenbacher et al.2017).

One important concern relates to the method used to evaluate and calculate TS and CPM, for which there are no formal recommendations. The distributions provided in this study were developed for a specific population and protocol, and variations in methods and population may yield different results. Using a fixed CPT temperature has advantages and disadvantages (Fanninger et al.2023), with a major drawback being that some participants may not feel pain during the stimulus; in our study, all participants experienced pain despite the use of a constant CPT temperature. Concerning the TS paradigm, it is possible that the stimulation intensity was not high enough to initiate the phenomenon in some individuals. The choice of stimulating around 50/100 was made to avoid ceiling and floor effects (Lie et al.2017; Ocay et al.2022). Furthermore, we cannot exclude possible order effects, since the two stimulus tests were not randomised. The decision to avoid randomisation was deliberate; given the longer duration of the thermal stimulus, we chose to consistently start with the mechanical stimuli to minimise the time between the conditioning stimulus and the two test stimuli. Lastly, while the algometer employed in the present study has been used in various other investigations (de la Coba et al.2022) it is important to underscore the lack of data regarding the reliability of such measurement in a CPM evaluation context.

Our request that participants avoid nicotine prior to participating in the study could also, paradoxically, affect pain measurement (Baiamonte et al.2016). Regarding the analyses, it should be noted that only sex and age were taken into account, and that other factors could potentially influence TS and CPM responses. Finally, it is essential to mention that the test–retest reliability of the TS and CPM measures is not perfect, with coefficients ranging from low to moderate, underscoring the challenge of implementing these mechanisms in a clinical context.

Our study also has several strengths, including a large sample size, increasing the generalisability of our results. Although our focus was on the highest values, we estimated several percentiles across the distribution to provide a more comprehensive overview of responses. We also maintained a standardised procedure by having no more than three evaluators, trained by the research team and subject to regular verifications and audits, in order to ensure consistency in the experimental protocol over time.

The results of this study provide valuable insights into the distribution of TS and CPM in pain‐free individuals. Our findings reveal significant variability in TS and CPM, confirming that factors such as sex and age can have a notable impact on these responses. This study represents another important step towards a better understanding of pain modulation mechanisms, the expected response spectrum in pain‐free individuals, and the future integration of these measures to improve pain management and advance personalised care.
