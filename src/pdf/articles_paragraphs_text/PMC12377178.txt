Severe kyphoscoliosis in spina bifida patients can result in thoracic insufficiency syndrome, which significantly compromises pulmonary function. While traditional clinical measures for spina bifida focus primarily on bladder function and motor strength, this case highlights pulmonary function as an essential additional indicator.

The authors report on the case of a 16-year-old male with spina bifida and severe thoracic kyphoscoliosis presenting with progressive respiratory difficulty limiting ambulation. Imaging revealed a thoracic curve of approximately 107° and markedly reduced thoracic spine height (13.4 cm). During definitive posterior spinal fusion and deformity correction surgery, intraoperative tidal volumes were continuously monitored. As spinal correction progressed, tidal volumes increased substantially, achieving approximately 20% improvement. Postoperatively, radiographic assessment showed correction of the thoracic scoliosis to approximately 40°, with thoracic height improving to 23.4 cm. Clinically, the patient reported subjective improvement in breathing and demonstrated increased ambulation endurance.

This case illustrates real-time intraoperative tidal volume monitoring as a potential physiological marker correlating directly with deformity correction efficacy and thoracic volume restoration. These findings suggest that pulmonary function may serve as an intraoperative adjunct to guide the surgical management of severe spinal deformities alongside conventional functional indicators. Further studies may establish a standardized formula that reliably predicts pulmonary function following deformity correction.

Postoperative outcomes in patients with severe scoliosis indicate that spinal correction can stabilize or enhance pulmonary capacity.4Long-term studies of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients show that while average pulmonary function may remain similar to preoperative levels, those with preexisting pulmonary impairment often experience significant improvements in forced vital capacity after fusion.4In adult severe scoliosis, surgical deformity correction has been associated with increases in total lung volume over a 5-year follow-up.5However, the literature on spina bifida–associated scoliosis and thoracic insufficiency is extremely limited.

Herein, we describe a case of severe spina bifida–associated kyphoscoliosis resulting in TIS, with impressive improvement in intraoperative tidal volumes to underscore the importance of considering pulmonary function in this population.

The patient is a 16-year-old male with a history of postnatally repaired lumbar myelomeningocele. He underwent multiple spinal cord detethering surgeries in childhood for progressive neurological decline, with the last complex cord detethering taking place approximately 4 months prior to the current presentation. As a result of his spina bifida, he had baseline lower extremity weakness and neurogenic bladder and bowel. Over the years, he developed progressive, severe kyphoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine. Clinically, he was able to stand and ambulate with an assistive device but complained of progressive inability to sustain even mild physical activity, being unable to ambulate 20 feet without becoming short of breath. Preoperative imaging demonstrated a thoracic dextroscoliosis of approximately 107°. His T1–12 vertical spine height was approximately 13.4 cm, indicating a markedly reduced thoracic volume (Fig. 1). Given the combination of a severe deformity and declining pulmonary endurance, surgical correction was offered. Unfortunately, due to scheduling and logistics, the patient was unable to undergo preoperative pulmonary function testing.

We performed a definitive posterior spinal fusion and deformity correction from the upper thoracic spine to the pelvis. Pedicle screws were placed from T2 to L5, and bilateral S2-alar-iliac bolts were placed, as well as bilateral iliac bolts to support a quad-rod construct. To release the rigid apex of the kyphoscoliosis and gain flexibility for correction, multiple posterior column osteotomies were performed at T5–T10, while additional facetectomies were performed from T3 to T4 and from T11 to L3 to further mobilize the curve. Additional anterior fusion was achieved via transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions at L4–L5 and L5–S1 using cages and bone morphogenic protein. These were done given the concern for a profound lack of posterior elements and decreased fusion surface secondary to the patient’s existing dysraphism and multiple detethering surgeries.

For the deformity correction, titanium rods were inserted bilaterally at the terminal ends of the construct, and intervening screws were sequentially captured to translate and de-rotate the spine. Concave and convex sides were done simultaneously to spread the load given numerous dysmorphic pedicles and a concern for losing fixation. Rod fixation and set screw tightening were completed from T2 to the sacrum, and auxiliary rods were used from bilateral iliac bolts to the thoracolumbar junction. Morselized allograft and autograft bone was placed posterolaterally and over lamina where present, to promote fusion. The procedure concluded with the placement of two subfascial drains and layered wound closure.

The surgery was completed in a single stage. Estimated blood loss was roughly 350 mL, and no blood transfusion was required. Neuromonitoring remained stable throughout. The patient was kept intubated only for the duration of the procedure; after wound closure, he was successfully extubated in the operating room. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit for routine postoperative observation. No immediate complications occurred during or after surgery.

Notably, as the spinal deformity was corrected, the anesthesiology team observed a marked change in the patient’s ventilatory parameters. During induction, exposure, osteotomies, and instrumentation, tidal volume was approximately 300–320 mL (Fig. 2). During deformity correction, the tidal volume gradually increased—initially using volume control ventilation, then transitioning to pressure control—to promote optimal lung expansion. By the time full correction was achieved just prior to rod locking, the patient’s tidal volumes had increased to 360–380 mL, a 20% increase over baseline. In essence, each degree of spinal straightening appeared to translate into improved lung expansion intraoperatively. This immediate physiological feedback, captured in real time (Fig. 2), reflected increased intrathoracic volume as the degree of deformity was reduced.

Postoperative radiographs showed substantial correction of the deformity. The thoracic scoliosis curve was reduced to roughly 40° (Fig. 3A), and the thoracic kyphosis was also markedly improved (Fig. 3B). The spinal alignment was well balanced in both the coronal and sagittal planes. Instrumentation from T2 to the pelvis is visible on the postoperative films, with good hardware placement. The increase in thoracic height and volume was evident on imaging (from 13.4 cm preoperatively to 23.4 cm postoperatively) (Fig. 3A), corresponding to the patient’s improved ventilatory capacity noted during surgery.

The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. On postoperative day 1, he was breathing room air comfortably with oxygen saturation > 95%. Neurologically, he was unchanged from his preoperative status. Despite surgical site pain, there was subjective report of improved ability to “take a deep breath” without any prompting from the examiner. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day 11. At his 3-month follow-up, the patient was ambulating longer distances with his walker than before surgery with reported improved endurance for daily activities.

The necessary informed consent was obtained in this study.

This case illustrates the extreme of spinal deformity causing physiological compromise, and a unique intraoperative observation linking spinal correction to immediate pulmonary changes. TIS in the context of severe kyphoscoliosis represents a failure of the thoracic cage to support normal respiration.6The primary goal of deformity surgery in such cases is often to improve respiratory mechanics. Our patient’s course demonstrates that aggressive surgical correction can be performed safely with modern techniques, leading to meaningful improvements in pulmonary function.

To our knowledge, real-time increases in tidal volume as a quantitative indicator of successful deformity release have not been reported in the spine surgery literature. In this patient, the rising tidal volumes correlated with surgical maneuvers that expanded his thorax, essentially providing immediate physiological feedback that the lungs were gaining space. This observation suggests a potential adjunct monitoring tool: ventilatory parameters, such as tidal volume or lung compliance measures, could be monitored during surgery as an indicator of how the chest is responding to the correction. More specifically, in this extremely high-risk population, where the degree of deformity correction may be limited by intraoperative neuromonitoring changes,7,8having a real-time indicator of potential postoperative vital capacity could significantly improve safety by addressing if the minimum necessary correction for respiratory function improvement has been achieved.

where k is a constant that would emerge from empirical data. In our single case, we cannot robustly establish such a formula, but we observed roughly a 20% increase in tidal volume accompanying a 50% correction in Cobb angle from approximately 110° to 40°. With further data from similar cases, we could refine this correlation and determine if a predictable trend exists. Additionally, future studies could use intraoperative pulmonary function measurements, such as dynamic compliance or even direct spirometry in intubated patients, to quantify changes during deformity correction.

The parameters to be fitted are baseline tidal volume (base), scaling factor (A), slope (k), and inflection point (x0). While the specific values of this model are subject to fluctuations based on differences across surgical cases, this model provides a framework for predicting the intraoperative increase in tidal volume based on the degree of spinal correction achieved, and future refinements fitted across several cases may help guide surgical targets for optimal thoracic expansion. It should be emphasized that the current model is a proof of concept based on a limited sample and is not intended for immediate clinical application. Future efforts will focus on expanding this framework through a larger case series or a prospective study, which will incorporate a greater diversity of surgical cases to enhance the model’s validity and generalizability. As additional data are collected, model refinement will allow for more robust predictions and may ultimately inform intraoperative decision-making with greater confidence.

From a broader perspective, this case also reinforces the multifaceted benefits of correcting severe spinal deformities. Not only was a major cosmetic and orthopedic disability addressed, but also the surgery significantly improved the patient’s stamina for ambulation and daily activities. Of note, in our case we also improved pelvic obliquity, which is a key indicator of pelvic imbalance often associated with skin ulceration adjacent to the ischial tuberosities and overall increased difficulty with home care.9Currently, much of the literature on spina bifida predominantly focuses on neurosurgical repair, neuroprotection, and the management of associated complications.10,11We assert then that in the spina bifida population with kyphoscoliosis, pulmonary function is an additional meaningful physiological marker of function, alongside the traditional indicators such as bladder function and motor strength.

Severe kyphoscoliosis with TIS in spina bifida patients can lead to profound respiratory compromise. The patient experienced a significant increase in his lung capacity intraoperatively, as evidenced by tidal volume monitoring, and a substantial radiographic correction of his deformity. This correlated with subjective reports of improved postoperative stamina during ambulation. Intraoperative tidal volume monitoring in this context proved to be a fascinating adjunctive measure, providing real-time confirmation of improved intrathoracic volume as the spine was straightened. This finding suggests that anesthesiologists and surgeons might collaboratively use changes in ventilatory parameters as an additional feedback mechanism during complex deformity corrections. Furthermore, we advocate for respiratory function to be an additional variable to monitor in spina bifida patients with associated spinal deformity, given its independent contribution to decrements in function.
