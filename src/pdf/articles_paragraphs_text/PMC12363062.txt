Rice, being a thermophilic crop, exhibits high sensitivity to low-temperature stress throughout its growth and development. Consequently, enhancing cold tolerance (CT) has been a paramount objective in rice breeding programs. The budding and seedling stages are particularly susceptible to low-temperature damage, making it crucial to improve CT during these stages to ensure the stable establishment and development of the rice population.

In this study, we exposed the parental lines Nipponbare (NIP) and Searice 86 (SR86), along with their derived 170 doubled-haploid (DH) population lines, to cold treatments during both the budding and seedling stages. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed using statistical indices such as the survival rate at the budding stage (SRBS), severity of damage at the budding stage (SDBS), survival rate at the seedling stage (SRSS), and wilting degree at the seedling stage (WDSS). This analysis identified four QTLs at the budding stage and eight QTLs at the seedling stage. Furthermore, by integrating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from transcriptomic data with genes located within the QTL regions, we identified 10 candidate genes for the budding stage and 11 candidate genes for the seedling stage. Based on DNA sequence variations between the parental lines, changes in gene expression under cold treatment, and haplotype analyses, the key candidate genes were ultimately determined to beOs02g0250600for the budding stage andOs06g0696600for the seedling stage. Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of transcriptomic data from both stages revealed significant differences in the regulatory pathways involved in CT between the budding and seedling stages.

Rice (Oryza sativaL.) is one of the most important staple crops globally, feeding approximately half of the world’s population [1]. However, rice growth is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, particularly temperature fluctuations [2]. With the intensification of global climate change, extreme weather events have become more frequent, posing significant challenges to rice cultivation in various regions due to cold stress. This stress not only affects seed germination and seedling growth but can also lead to severe yield reductions or even complete crop failure [3–5]. Therefore, developing cold-tolerant rice varieties has become a crucial goal for ensuring global food security and promoting sustainable agriculture.

The research and promotion of cold-tolerant rice have significant practical value worldwide. In temperate regions such as Japan, Korea, northeastern China, California in the United States and parts of Europe (e.g., Italy and Spain), low temperatures in spring often hinder rice growth, affecting early development and final yield [6–8]. In recent years, with the increasing adoption of direct-seeded rice technology, CT during the budding and seedling stages has become a key focus in rice breeding [9]. By selecting and cultivating cold-tolerant varieties, the negative impact of early spring low temperatures on sprout and seedling can be effectively reduced, facilitating the expansion of direct-seeded rice cultivation [10]. Additionally, in high-altitude regions such as the Kunming province and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in southwestern China, the Andes in South America, and the Himalayan countries including Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India, large diurnal temperature variations and frequent extreme cold weather during spring and autumn severely restrict rice cultivation and yield [8]. However, with population growth and increasing food demand, the need for rice cultivation in these areas has been rising. In recent years, successful trials of cold-tolerant rice varieties have demonstrated that, through genetic improvement and advanced breeding techniques, rice cultivation can be expanded to high-altitude regions, enhancing local food self-sufficiency.

The genetics of rice CT is complex and classified as a quantitative trait governed by multiple genes. Studies focusing on CT during the budding and seedling stages have identified several QTLs associated with these traits. Yang et al. [11] conducted high-throughput sequencing analysis on 460 F2:3mapping population individuals, identifying a key QTL for CT at the bud-bursting stage, designatedqCTBB9. By analyzing changes in gene expression levels under cold stress and performing haplotype analysis,Os09g0444200was pinpointed as the candidate gene for this locus. Similarly, Zhang et al. [6] performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 249 indica rice varieties, detecting 47 significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci associated with severity of damage (SD) and survival rate (SR). Through linkage disequilibrium decay analysis, GO enrichment analysis, RNA-seq data, and gene expression pattern analysis, three potential CT candidate genes (LOC_Os01g55510,LOC_Os01g55350, andLOC_Os01g55560) were identified. Recently, Wu et al. [12] constructed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population by crossing NIP with WD16343 and identified a major CT QTL,qCTS11, on chromosome 11 through bulked segregant analysis (BSA)-seq, leading to the discovery of two CT genes,COLD11andOsCTS11. Shi et al. [13] investigated the seedling-stage CT traits of 1,992 rice germplasms and conducted GWAS analysis on SR and leaf cold tolerance (SCT), identifying a total of 29 QTLs associated with seedling-stage CT, among which four QTLs (qSR3.1a,qSR4.1a,qSR11.1x, andqSR12.1a) played significant roles. To date, numerous CT genes have been identified and cloned in rice. These includeqLTG3[14],OsSAP16[15],OsLTPL159[16], andOsUBC12[17], which confer CT during the germination stage;COLD1[18],bZIP73[19],qPSR10[20],HAN1[21],COG1[22],COLD11[23],SOP10[24], andCOG3[25], which regulate CT at the seedling stage; andCtb1[26],CTB4a[27],LTT1[28],CTB2[8],LEA9[29],CTB5[30], andCTB6[31], which influence CT at the booting stage. Despite these advancements, only a limited number of cloned genes have been effectively utilized in practical breeding programs for enhancing CT. Consequently, the identification and exploitation of new favorable alleles or haplotypes from germplasm resources remain crucial for efficient rice breeding aimed at improving CT.

This study employed the cold-tolerant japonica rice variety NIP and the cold-sensitive indica rice variety SR86, along with their DH population, as experimental materials. We evaluated CT-related traits, including SDBS and SRBS at the budding stage, and SRSS and WDSS at the seedling stage under low-temperature stress conditions to identify QTLs associated with CT in rice. Transcriptome analysis was conducted on the parental lines and extreme progenies under both normal and cold stress conditions. The DEGs were then mapped to the QTL regions, leading to the identification of 10 candidate genes at the budding stage and 11 at the seedling stage. Further transcriptome and haplotype analyses of these genes identifiedOs02g0250600as a key candidate gene for the budding stage andOs06g0696600for the seedling stage. Additionally, GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed on the DEGs under both conditions, revealing important regulatory pathways involved in rice CT. These findings provide a foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of CT and offer valuable resources for breeding cold-tolerant rice varieties.

The experimental materials utilized in this study encompass two parental lines, Searice 86 (SR86) and Nipponbare (NIP), along with a DH population. This DH population was previously developed by our research team through the hybridization of the two parental lines followed by anther culture. SR86, an ancient indica subspecies that is phylogenetically proximate to the divergence point of major rice varieties, has been extensively employed as a donor parent for salt tolerance [32]. The DH population comprises 170 lines. All plant cultivation and cold treatment experiments were conducted at the Institute of Crop Sciences (39.9578°N, 116.3163°E), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Dormancy was broken by exposing seeds to a 50 °C oven for five consecutive days. Subsequently, the seeds were subjected to sodium hypochlorite treatment, followed by thorough rinsing and soaking to enhance germination. Thirty seeds exhibiting a shoot length of 5 mm were selected and placed in Petri dishes containing 10 mL of distilled water. The dishes were incubated in a growth chamber set at 4 °C under dark conditions for ten days with the reference to Li et al. [3], with three replicates. Following the cold treatment, the Petri dishes containing the seeds were transferred to an incubator maintained at 30 °C with a photoperiod of 14 h light and 10 h darkness for a recovery period of five days. The SDBS was evaluated after three days of recovery, using the grading scale provided in Table1.. The SRBS was assessed after five days of recovery and calculated as the percentage of surviving seedlings out of the initial 30.

The dormancy-broken seeds were subjected to surface sterilization using a sodium hypochlorite solution, followed by thorough rinsing and soaking to promote germination. Germinated seeds were then placed in PCR plates with perforated bottoms and transferred to a climate chamber maintained at 30 °C with a photoperiod of 14 h light/10 hours dark for hydroponic cultivation. Each treatment group consisted of 8 seedlings, with three biological replicates. Upon reaching the three-leaf and one-heart stage, the seedlings underwent a 6-day low-temperature stress treatment at 5 °C with the reference to Wu et al. [12], while all other conditions remained constant. Following this, the seedlings were returned to the 30 °C climate chamber under the same photoperiod for a 7-day recovery period. At the conclusion of the recovery period, WDSS and SRSS were assessed. The WDSS grading scale is detailed in Table1. The survival rate was calculated as follows: SRSS (%) = (Number of survival plants/Total number of plants) × 100.

High-quality SNP markers, characterized by less than 5% missing data and exhibiting polymorphism between the parental lines, were selected from the 40 K SNP dataset for genetic map construction and QTL mapping analysis. Redundant markers were eliminated using the BIN function in ICI Mapping (version 4.2). A genetic linkage map was subsequently constructed based on the remaining SNP markers. QTL mapping for the four CT-related traits was conducted using the BIP function [33], with a LOD threshold of 2.5 set for QTL identification. Regions with LOD values exceeding 2.5 were deemed to contain QTLs, and their phenotypic variation rates and additive effects were calculated. In the DH population, a negative additive effect signifies that the allele originates from the parent “SR86”, whereas a positive additive effect indicates an origin from the parent “NIP”.

Based on their responses to cold treatment at the budding and seedling stages, NIP was identified as a cold-tolerant material, whereas SR86 was classified as a cold-sensitive material. According to the performance of CT and QTL mapping results, the following DH lines were selected: DH58, which exhibited CT at both budding and seedling stages; DH253 and DH200, which showed cold sensitivity at these stages. After seed soaking and germination, seeds from the four lines (NIP, SR86, DH58, and DH253) were divided into two groups: one group was grown at room temperature as the control, while the other group was subjected to a 4 °C treatment. Following a 48-hour cold treatment, samples from the control group were collected and designated as BS-NIP-CK, BS-SR86-CK, BS-DH58-CK, and BS-DH253-CK, respectively. Similarly, samples from the treatment group were collected and named BS-NIP-LT, BS-SR86-LT, BS-DH58-LT, and BS-DH253-LT. Consistent protocols were employed for the sampling of four lines (NIP, SR86, DH58, and DH200) at the seedling stage. Upon reaching the three-leaf and one-heart stage, the experimental group was subjected to a 4 °C treatment for 48 h. The above-ground parts of each sample were collected and designated as SS-NIP-LT, SS-SR86-LT, SS-DH58-LT, and SS-DH200-LT. Concurrently, the control group samples were collected at room temperature and named SS-NIP-CK, SS-SR86-CK, SS-DH58-CK, and SS-DH200-CK. Each sample was collected in triplicate for biological replication and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction, cDNA library preparation, and sequencing were conducted by Beijing Tsingke Biotech Co., Ltd. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 software, with a significance threshold set atP-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change of |log2FC| ≥ 1. Functional enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways was conducted using clusterProfiler software [34,35]. KEGG pathway enrichment was assessed using aP-value < 0.05, while GO terms with aP-value < 0.01 were considered significantly enriched.

The data utilized for the analysis of cold-tolerant haplotypes at the budding stage were derived from previously published results by our laboratory [36]. The population, sourced from the 3 K Rice Genome Project [37], comprised 513 accessions: 129 from the Aus subgroup, 35 from the Basmati subgroup, 119 from the GJ subgroup, and 230 from the XI subgroup. Similarly, the CT data at the seedling stage were obtained from our laboratory’s recent study, encompassing 1,992 accessions: 473 from the GJ subgroup, 1,290 from the XI subgroup, 133 from the Aus subgroup, 35 from the Basmati subgroup, and 133 classified as admixtures [13]. Haplotypes with phenotypic counts exceeding 30 were selected to investigate the potential association between the identified key genes and CT in rice.

The RNA extraction materials were consistent with those used for transcriptome sequencing. Total RNA (1 µg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using FastKing gDNA Dispelling RT SuperMix kit (Tiangen, China, KR118-02). qRT-PCR was performed using a Light Cycler 480 instrument (Roche, Switzerland, 05015278001) with the Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China, Q712) including three biological replicates.UBQwas used as the internal control, and the relative expression levels of the target genes were quantified using the comparative cycle threshold method [38]. Eight genes were randomly selected from the differentially expressed genes identified in the budding and seedling stage transcriptomes for qRT-PCR validation, respectively. Primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S37.

To assess the CT of the parental lines NIP and SR86, we evaluated the survival rates (SRBS and SRSS) and damage degrees (SDBS and WDSS) following cold treatment at both the budding and seedling stages (Table2, Fig. S1). The results indicated that the SRBS and SRSS of NIP were significantly higher than those of SR86, while the SDBS and WDSS were significantly lower. These findings suggest substantial genetic differences in CT traits between NIP and SR86 at both developmental stages, rendering the populations derived from them suitable for QTL analysis and candidate gene identification. Phenotypic evaluation of the DH population revealed that SRBS ranged from 0 to 100%, with an average of 55.84%; SDBS ranged from 1.02 to 9.00, with an average of 5.07; SRSS ranged from 0 to 100%, with an average of 30.30%; and WDSS ranged from 1.00 to 9.00, with an average of 6.19 (Table 2; Fig. 1A-D, Table S1, S2). Correlation analysis under cold stress showed that the correlation coefficients between SRBS and SDBS, and between SRSS and WDSS, were both below − 0.95, indicating a strong negative correlation between survival rate and damage degree within the same treatment stage. However, the correlation coefficients between traits across different stages were relatively low, suggesting distinct genetic mechanisms control CT at the budding and seedling stages (Fig.1E).

Performance of parents and 170 DH lines for cold tolerance-related traits at budding and seedling stages.

CT QTL analysis was conducted using ICI Mapping 4.2 software, which identified a total of 12 QTLs: 2 SRBS, 2 SDBS, 5 SRSS, and 3 WDSS, distributed across chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, and 12. Notably, the QTLsSRBS2-1,SRBS2-2,SRSS9-1, andSRSS11-1are colocalized withSDBS2-1,SDBS2-2,WDSS9-1, andWDSS11-1, respectively (Table3). Based on the confidence intervals of each QTL, the number of genes within each region was determined as follows:SRBS2-1/SDBS2-1contains 70 genes (Table S3);SRBS2-2/SDBS2-2contains 41 genes (Table S4);SRSS3-1contains 8 genes (Table S5);WDSS3-1contains 15 genes (Table S6);SRSS6-1contains 95 genes (Table S7);SRSS9-1/WDSS9-1contains 19 genes (Table S8);SRSS11-1/WDSS11-1contains 19 genes (Table S9); andSRSS12-1contains three genes (Table S10).

QTL identified for cold tolerance-related traits from the DH population.

The mRNA sequencing of 24 samples collected during the budding stage yielded a total of 38,640,054 to 53,279,300 raw reads. Following stringent quality control and filtering procedures, we obtained 34,978,336 to 49,081,006 clean reads. The proportion of high-quality bases (Q30) across all samples exceeded 94.25%, with overall mapping rates ranging from 93.36 to 97.76% and unique mapping rates varying between 83.72% and 95.49% (Table S11). Principal component analysis (PCA) based on transcriptome data demonstrated clear separation among different varieties and consistent clustering within the same variety, thereby validating the robustness and reliability of our data (Fig. S2A). To verify the accuracy of the RNA-seq data at the budding stage, eight different types of DEGs were randomly selected for qRT-PCR analysis. The results showed that the expression patterns of all genes were consistent with the RNA-seq data (Fig. S3).

To explore transcriptomic differences under cold stress at the budding stage, RNA-seq comparisons were made between NIP and SR86, and between DH58 and DH253. A total of 4,600, 6,128, 9,123, and 6,809 DEGs were identified for G1 (BS-NIP-CK vs. BS-SR86-CK), G2 (BS-NIP-LT vs. BS-SR86-LT), G3 (BS-DH58-CK vs. BS-DH253-CK), and G4 (BS-DH58-LT vs. BS-DH253-LT), respectively. Among these, 3,051, 3,553, 4,801, and 3,464 DEGs were down-regulated, while 1,549, 2,575, 4,322, and 3,345 DEGs were up-regulated in G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively (Fig.2A-C). We compared the DEGs with the genes contained in the CT QTLs at the budding stage and found that 76 BS-QTL-candidates did not match any DEGs. This indicates that these genes showed no differential expression between parents or extreme individuals under either normal or low-temperature conditions. Among the BS-QTL-candidates, 9 matched with G3, 4 matched with G2, 2 matched with G4, and 1 matched with G1, suggesting that these genes exhibited differential expression in only one specific condition. Additionally, 4 BS-QTL-candidates matched both G2 and G4, 2 matched both G2 and G3, 2 matched both G1 and G2, and 2 matched both G1 and G4, indicating that these genes were differentially expressed in two conditions. Furthermore, 3 BS-QTL-candidates matched G1, G2, and G4, while 2 matched G1, G3, and G4, showing differential expression in three conditions. Finally, 5 BS-QTL-candidates matched all four conditions, indicating differential expression across all scenarios (Fig.2D, Table S3, S4, S12). Since differences in gene expression among materials often lead to phenotypic variation, we used the criterion of differential expression in at least three groups to select candidate genes, ultimately identifying 10 key candidate genes. Specifically,Os02g0282900,Os02g0249600,Os02g0250600, andOs02g0281200were consistently down-regulated across all four groups.Os02g0285800exhibited down-regulation in G1 but up-regulation in G2, G3, and G4.Os02g0245200was down-regulated in G1, G3, and G4.Os02g0287000showed up-regulation in G1, G3, and G4.Os02g0285900andOs02g0244700were down-regulated in G1, G2, and G4.Os02g0288000was up-regulated in G1, G2, and G4 (Table4).

Candidate genes for cold tolerance at the budding stage. Note: G1:BS-NIP-CK vs. BS-SR86-CK; G2:BS-NIP-LT vs. BS-SR86-LT; G3:BS-DH58-CK vs. BS-DH253-CK; G4:BS-DH58-LT vs. BS-DH253-LT.

The mRNA sequencing of 24 samples treated at the seedling stage yielded a total of 42,126,406 to 58,871,060 raw reads. After stringent quality control filtering, we obtained 36,043,890 to 55,439,556 clean reads. The proportion of high-quality bases (Q30) across all samples exceeded 93.43%, with mapping rates ranging from 92.8 to 98.81% and unique mapping rates spanning from 83.2 to 96.05% (Table S13). PCA based on transcriptome data demonstrated clear separation among different varieties and consistent clustering within the same variety, thereby validating the high reliability of our data (Fig. S2B). Similarly, to verify the accuracy of the RNA-seq data at the seedling stage, eight different types of DEGs were randomly selected for qRT-PCR analysis. The results showed that the expression patterns of all genes were consistent with the RNA-seq data (Fig. S4).

To elucidate the transcriptomic differences in response to cold stress at the seedling stage between rice accessions with varying levels of CT, we conducted RNA-seq analyses comparing NIP with SR86 and DH58 with DH200. The analysis identified 5,751, 7,076, 5,938, and 10,442 DEGs for G5 (SS-NIP-CK vs. SS-SR86-CK), G6 (SS-NIP-LT vs. SS-SR86-LT), G7 (SS-DH58-CK vs. SS-DH200-CK), and G8 (SS-DH58-LT vs. SS-DH200-LT), respectively. Specifically, 3,633, 3,538, 2,969, and 5,221 DEGs were down-regulated, while 2,118, 3,793, 3,697, and 5,770 DEGs were up-regulated in G5, G6, G7, and G8, respectively (Fig.3A-C). We compared the DEGs with the genes contained in the CT QTLs at the seedling stage and found that 102 SS-QTL-candidates did not match any DEGs. This indicates that these genes showed no differential expression between parents or extreme individuals under either normal or low-temperature conditions. Among the SS-QTL-candidates, 12 matched with G4, 6 matched with G2, 5 matched with G1, and 2 matched with G3, suggesting that these genes exhibited differential expression in only one specific condition. Additionally, 8 SS-QTL-candidates matched both G3 and G4, 7 matched both G2 and G4, 4 matched both G1 and G3, and 2 matched both G1 and G3, indicating that these genes were differentially expressed in two conditions. Furthermore, 6 SS-QTL-candidates matched G2, G3 and G4, 2 matched G1, G3 and G4, and 1 matched G1, G2 and G3, showing differential expression in three conditions. Finally, 2 SS-QTL-candidates matched all four conditions, indicating differential expression across all scenarios (Fig.3D, Table S5-10, 14). We used the criterion of differential expression in at least three groups to select candidate genes, ultimately identifying 11 key candidate genes. Notably,Os06g0690200was consistently down-regulated across all four groups. Conversely,Os03g0207475andOs06g0693000were consistently up-regulated.Os06g0696600exhibited down-regulation in G5 but up-regulation in G7 and G8.Os06g0693100showed up-regulation in G5, G7, and G8. Additionally,Os06g0691400,Os06g0695500,Os06g0687450,Os09g0375000,Os11g0499600, andOs03g0189100were up-regulated in G6, G7, and G8 (Table5).

Candidate genes for cold tolerance at the seedling stage. Note: G5: SS-NIP-CK vs. SS-SR86-CK; G6: SS-NIP-LT vs. SS-SR86-LT; G7: SS-DH58-CK vs. SS-DH200-CK; G8: SS-DH58-LT vs. SS-DH200-LT.

During the initial phase of our study, we identified a total of 10 candidate genes. To determine the key candidate gene, we first compared the DNA sequences of these 10 genes between the two parental lines. The results showed that 9 genes contained nonsynonymous SNPs, and 4 genes had InDels. Subsequently, we analyzed changes in gene expression levels before and after cold treatment. Among these genes,Os02g0250600showed increased expression levels in both parents following cold treatment, indicating its induction by cold stress (Table S35). We also validated the expression of this gene through qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome data (Fig. S5A). Therefore, we identifiedOs02g0250600as the most critical candidate gene for CT at the budding stage. This gene encodes a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) domain-containing protein (Table4). Leveraging published data on CT for 3 K germplasms, we conducted a haplotype analysis of the coding sequence (CDS) region of this gene. The analysis revealed 17 SNPs, which were grouped into five distinct haplotypes. Notably, Hap4 demonstrated the lowest SDBS and the highest SRBS, suggesting it is an advantageous haplotype for CT at the budding stage. Specifically, NIP belongs to Hap4, while SR86 is associated with Hap5, a less favorable haplotype. The distribution of haplotypes across subgroups was as follows: Hap1 was predominantly found in the Aus subgroup, Hap2 appeared mainly in the Aus and XI subgroups, Hap3 was predominant in the GJ and XI subgroups, Hap4 was primarily present in the GJ subgroup, and Hap5 was exclusive to the XI subgroup (Fig.4A-D).

At the seedling stage, a total of 11 candidate genes were identified. Upon comparing the DNA sequences of these genes between the two parental lines, it was observed that eight genes exhibited nonsynonymous SNPs, and 2 genes contained InDels. Expression analysis indicated thatOs06g0696600demonstrated elevated expression levels in both parents following cold treatment, suggesting its induction by cold stress (Table S36). We also validated the expression of this gene through qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome data (Fig. S5B). Consequently,Os06g0696600was identified as the most critical candidate gene for CT at the seedling stage. This gene encodes a xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase homolog (Table5). Utilizing published population data, haplotype analysis of the CDS region of this gene revealed three SNPs, which were classified into five distinct haplotypes. Comparative analysis of shoot survival with WDSS and shoot survival with recovery rate SRSS across the five haplotypes showed that Hap2 and Hap4 exhibited significantly lower WDSS and higher SRSS compared to Hap1, Hap3, and Hap5, indicating that Hap2 and Hap4 are advantageous haplotypes for CT at the seedling stage. NIP belongs to Hap2, while SR86 is associated with Hap3. The distribution of haplotypes revealed that Hap1, Hap3, and Hap5 were predominantly present in the XI subgroup, whereas Hap2 and Hap4 were primarily found in the GJ subgroup (Fig.4E-H).

To elucidate the key biological processes and pathways influenced by cold stress during the budding and seedling stages in rice, we conducted GO and KEGG enrichment analyses on DEGs from the same materials under normal and low-temperature conditions. The comparisons encompassed BS-NIP-CK vs. BS-NIP-LT, BS-SR86-CK vs. BS-SR86-LT, BS-DH58-CK vs. BS-DH58-LT, BS-DH253-CK vs. BS-DH253-LT, SS-NIP-CK vs. SS-NIP-LT, SS-SR86-CK vs. SS-SR86-LT, SS-DH58-CK vs. SS-DH58-LT, and SS-DH253-CK vs. SS-DH253-LT. These analyses identified 1,001, 1,551, 1,350, 1,643, 675, 1,224, 963, and 900 significantly enriched GO terms, respectively, as well as 18, 15, 12, 8, 17, 17, 14, and 29 significantly enriched KEGG pathways, respectively (Tables S15-18, 20–23, 25–28, 30–33). In the analysis of the four groups during the budding stage, 164 GO terms and two KEGG pathways were found to be completely overlapping, while for the four groups during the seedling stage, 116 GO terms and two KEGG pathways exhibited complete overlap (Fig.5A-D, Tables S19, 24, 29, 34). The common GO enrichment at the budding stage was mainly concentrated in the nucleus (GO:0005634) and cytoplasm (GO:0005737), while KEGG enrichment was primarily found in spliceosome (ko03040) and plant hormone signal transduction pathways (ko04075) (Fig. S6). In contrast, the common GO enrichment at the seedling stage was mainly associated with the chloroplast (GO:0009507) and response to abscisic acid (GO:0009737), and the KEGG enrichment was predominantly involved in metabolic pathways (ko01100) and carbon metabolism (ko01200) (Fig. S7). These results suggest that the overlapping biological processes and pathways may constitute core components of the regulatory mechanisms for CT during the budding and seedling stages in rice. When comparing the core components of CT regulatory mechanisms between the budding and seedling stages, only 14 overlapping GO terms and no overlapping KEGG pathways were identified (Fig.5E, F), indicating significant differences in the regulatory networks and pathways involved in CT between these two developmental stages.

Low temperature exerts a substantial influence on rice production, particularly during the critical budding and seedling stages, resulting in delayed germination and extensive seedling rot [39]. Therefore, identifying and cloning CT genes from resistant varieties for use in breeding programs remains a key objective in rice improvement. The conventional approach to gene mapping involves crossing cold-tolerant with cold-sensitive varieties to develop recombinant inbred lines, double haploid lines, and introgression line populations [40,41]. However, the identified QTLs are frequently located within broad genomic regions, complicating the process of gene cloning. Transcriptomics offers a powerful tool for rapidly identifying DEGs associated with a target trait by comparing control and treatment samples [42]. Therefore, integrating QTL mapping with transcriptomics can markedly enhance the efficiency of gene localization and has emerged as a prevalent strategy. For instance, Yin et al. [43] combined transcriptomic data from parental lines and extreme progeny with QTL mapping results for anaerobic stress in a DH population, ultimately pinpointing key genesOs05g0498700andOs01g0866100, which negatively regulate coleoptile length and improve rice’s tolerance to anaerobic germination. Similarly, Zhou et al. [44] utilized RNA-seq, BSA-seq, and linkage analysis in a BC₅F₂ population and its parents—Xieqingzao B (XB) and 19H19 (derived from an interspecific cross between Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogonGriff.) and XB)—to identifyLOC_Os12g18729as a CT gene at the seedling stage. In this study, we employed a cold-tolerant variety NIP, a cold-sensitive variety SR86, and a DH population of 170 individuals for QTL mapping under cold treatment at both the budding and seedling stages. Four QTLs were respectively identified at the budding stage and eight at the seedling stage. By comparing with previously reported QTLs, we found that the seedling stage CT QTLqCTS3[45] is colocalized with SRSS3-1, the low-temperature vigor of germination QTLqLVG6[46] colocalized withSRSS6-1, the low-temperature germination QTLqLTG-9[47] colocalized withSRSS9-1andWDSS9-1, and the low-temperature germination QTL qLTG-11-1[48] colocalized withSRSS11-1andWDSS11-1. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted on NIP, SR86, and two extreme materials at both stages, comparing DEGs within the QTL intervals. Consequently, 10 candidate genes for CT were identified at the budding stage and 11 at the seedling stage.

Analysis of 10 candidate genes for CT at the budding stage revealed that onlyOs02g0250600exhibited nonsynonymous SNP variations and InDel differences in the coding regions of both parental lines and was upregulated under cold stress. Haplotype analysis further corroborated this finding, identifying Hap4 as the superior haplotype for CT, predominantly distributed within the GJ subgroup. Based on the distribution of nonsynonymous SNP variations and haplotypes, the three SNPs located at positions 8,516,827, 8,517,867, and 8,518,165 are crucial for the differences in CT among different haplotypes. This gene encodes a LEA domain-containing protein, which is specifically expressed and highly abundant in the embryo and endosperm of seeds (https://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi? orf=LOC_Os02g15250). Given that the budding stage encompasses the development of the embryo root and shoot, the expression of this gene during this phase is also elevated, underscoring its critical role in conferring CT during germination. LEA proteins are not only present during seed development but can be also strongly induced in vegetative tissues under abiotic stresses such as drought, low temperature, and high salinity [49,50]. As key protective factors in plant responses to cold stress, LEA proteins help maintain cellular structure and functional integrity through multiple mechanisms, including molecular chaperone activity, ion chelation, osmotic regulation, and ice crystal control [51]. In rice, several LEA protein-encoding genes have been previously reported to be associated with cold stress, such asOsLEA5[52],wsi18[53],OsLEA9[29], andOsLEA4[54]. Based on these findings, we propose thatOs02g0250600is a key regulator of CT at the budding stage in rice.

Among the 11 candidate genes associated with CT at the seedling stage, we identifiedOs06g0696600, which encodes a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (https://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g48180). Glycosyl hydrolase family 16 enzymes enhance plant CT through three mechanisms: cell wall remodeling, membrane stabilization, and signal transduction [55,56]. In rice, this gene family comprises 32 homologous genes, four of which have been cloned:OsXTH8[57],OsXTH11,OsXTH19, andOsXTH20[58]. According to RNA-seq data from rice (https://plantrnadb.com/ricerna/), the expression levels of these genes are significantly upregulated under cold stress conditions, indicating that glycosyl hydrolase family 16 plays a crucial role in conferring CT during the seedling stage. Haplotype analysis ofOs06g0696600revealed that Hap2 and Hap4 are superior haplotypes for CT, predominantly observed in the GJ subgroup. Based on the distribution of nonsynonymous SNP variation and haplotypes, the SNP located at positions 29,144,968 is crucial for the difference in CT among different haplotypes.

NIP, as a cold-tolerant rice variety, has had several CT genes cloned from its genome.COG3encodes a calmodulin-binding protein that maintains the protease activity of OsFtsH2, thereby regulating CT in rice during the booting and seedling stages [25].COLD1encodes a G-protein signaling regulator that, upon sensing low temperatures, interacts with the G-protein α subunit RGA, activates Ca2+channels, and subsequently enhances G-protein GTPase activity, thereby improving CT [18]. The functions of these two genes do not appear to be part of the established regulatory networks, highlighting the complexity of CT mechanisms in rice. While the relationship between these genes and CT has been preliminarily analyzed, further validation through genetic materials and molecular biology experiments is essential to confirm their specific roles. In the future, research will focus on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional analysis of these key genes, investigation of their interactions with hormonal and metabolic pathways, to further elucidate their roles in regulating responses to cold stress.

The budding and seedling stages represent distinct developmental phases in rice. The budding stage encompasses the period from seed imbibition until the emergence of the first leaf, characterized by low CT. During this phase, low temperatures can inhibit embryo root and shoot development, resulting in reduced germination rates or growth arrest [42]. In contrast, the seedling stage is marked by relatively developed roots and leaves, enabling active absorption of external nutrients and water. Cold stress during this stage primarily slows growth rates rather than causing direct mortality [45]. Rice CT exhibits stage-specific characteristics, with different QTLs identified at various growth stages within the same population [59]. In this study, we identified CT QTLs at both the budding and seedling stages in the same population. Correlation analysis revealed that traits within the same stage were highly correlated, whereas correlations between traits from different stages were relatively low. QTL analysis showed no overlap between the QTL intervals for the two stages, and comparisons of GO and KEGG analyses indicated minimal overlap. These findings are consistent with previous studies [4,60,61], suggesting that the genetic mechanisms underlying CT at the budding and seedling stages are distinct.

Rice plants exhibit varying levels of CT at different developmental stages, demonstrating particular sensitivity during germination, seedling, and especially reproductive phases. Cold stress during the germination and seedling stages adversely affects emergence and survival rates, thereby impacting the morphological establishment of the rice population. Conversely, cold stress during the reproductive growth stage reduces seed setting rates, ultimately affecting rice yield. Studies have shown that genetic factors influencing CT at different developmental stages are largely independent in rice [5,59]. To date, a considerable number of CT-related genes have been identified and cloned in rice during the germination, seedling, and booting stages, as previously mentioned. Following functional verification, the two newly identified genes,Os02g0250600andOs06g0696600, can be integrated with other CT genes at the germination, seedling, and booting stages using marker-assisted selection to develop varieties with enhanced CT across all stages. Meanwhile, given the distinct stage-specific nature of CT in rice, it is recommended that breeding practices optimize the selection criteria and strategies for CT traits at each developmental stage separately, in order to achieve coordinated improvement of CT across multiple growth stages through molecular breeding approaches.

Based on the evaluation of four traits, it was observed that NIP demonstrated significantly higher CT than SR86 during both the budding and seedling stages. In the derived DH population, four QTLs associated with CT at the budding stage and eight QTLs at the seedling stage were identified. Transcriptome and haplotype analyses ultimately pinpointedOs02g0250600as the key gene responsible for CT at the budding stage andOs06g0696600as the key gene at the seedling stage. Notably, there was no overlap between the QTLs identified at the budding and seedling stages. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed significant differences in CT mechanisms between the two developmental stages, indicating that rice CT exhibits distinct stage-specific characteristics. This study not only identifies two important candidate CT genes for functional analysis and rice CT breeding applications, but also deepens our understanding of CT mechanisms across different rice developmental stages.
