Cadmium (Cd), a non-essential heavy metal, induces severe phytotoxicity through oxidative stress and cellular homeostasis disruption. Chronic Cd exposure inhibits plant growth via leaf chlorosis, stunted stem elongation, and impaired root architecture, while disrupting physiological functions through chlorophyll degradation, membrane peroxidation, and antioxidant system collapse. This review systematically investigates plant adaptive responses to Cd stress. It examines the processes of Cd uptake pathways, translocation dynamics, physiological toxicity, and molecular defense mechanisms. Key findings highlight two main protective strategies: avoidance mechanisms involving root secretion regulation, cellular compartmentalization, efflux transport, and the other through chelation, antioxidant systems, and phytohormonal regulation in tolerance mechanisms. A particular emphasis is placed on the coordinated actions between metal-chelating compounds (including PCs, MTs, and MTPs) and both enzymatic (SOD, CAT) and non-enzymatic antioxidants. These insights advance the theoretical framework for plant Cd resistance and inform innovative implications for developing effective remediation approaches.

Plant roots primarily absorb Cd2+from contaminated soil through two distinct mechanisms regulated by both soil factors and plant genetic characteristics. The absorption efficiency depends on soil Cd concentration, pH levels, plant species, and cultivation conditions.11Subsequent translocation and distribution of Cd within plant tissues are governed by complex physiological regulation systems.

The first uptake mechanism involves rhizospheric chelation facilitated by root exudates (Figure 1).12These organic compounds, particularly low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA), enhance heavy metal bioavailability through ligand complexation, thereby promoting metal absorption and accumulation in roots.13Liu et al.14demonstrated thatOryza sativaL. roots modulate LMWOA secretion in response to soil Cd2+concentrations and genotypic variations, suggesting this process constitutes a critical determinant of interspecific differences in Cd uptake efficiency. Chen et al.15further elucidated the concentration-dependent effects of root exudates, reporting optimal Cd removal efficiency at 100 mmol/L citric acid, whereas low concentrations of glycine and maltose enhanced plant biomass remediation performance.

The second mechanism relies on transmembrane transport through specialized ion channels. Cd2+ions initially penetrate root hair cells via specific transporters in semipermeable plasma membranes, then migrate into cortical tissues through symplastic pathways.16This transport structure highlights the importance of root structure in regulating metal uptake. For instance,Zea maysL. root architecture demonstrates significant correlations with Cd absorption capacity under varying cultivation conditions, particularly in relation to water availability and nutrient status.17These processes work together under precise physiological regulation to control Cd uptake while preserving essential metabolic functions. The contribution of each pathway varies with plant species and environmental factors, highlighting the complexity of metal homeostasis in plants.

Following root absorption, Cd2+undergoes compartmentalized transport through two vascular systems: predominant xylem-mediated distribution and limited phloem-assisted translocation (Figure 1). Variations in metal transport capacity among species are well documented, with hyperaccumulators exhibiting specialized mechanisms.18Noccaea caerulescensL. (a Cd-hyperaccumulator species) develops a highly selective Cd transport system in the plasma membrane of root cells, resulting in exceptional Cd accumulation.19However, Yang et al.20reported differential Cd allocation patterns: preferential shoot translocation inBrassica oleraceaL. andZea maysL., versus root sequestration inLolium perenneL.

This metal partitioning is governed by coordinated gene networks regulating cellular detoxification and systemic distribution.21ZRT/IRT-like proteins (ZIPs) mediate nonspecific Cd2+uptake via transporters (e.g., IRT1), contributing to rhizospheric accumulation.22Cation diffusion facilitators (CDFs) facilitate vacuolar sequestration via antiporters (e.g.,MTP3andMTP4), thereby reducing cytosolic toxicity.MTP3is specifically localized to the vacuolar membrane for Cd compartmentalization23Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMPs) enabling long-distance transport through symplastic loading, particularlyNRAMP1andNRAMP5mediated root-to-shoot translocation.NRAMP5also plays a critical role in Mn/Cd cotransport.24Heavy metal ATPases (HMA2,HMA3, andHMA4) contribute to xylem loading and systemic distribution.25HMA3sequesters Cd into vacuoles alongside phytochelatins (PCs), forming Cd-PC complexes for detoxification. These transporter systems exhibit functional specialization and regulatory interactions.26Metallothioneins (MT1andMT2) provide additional cytosolic metal buffering capacity, particularly in roots and shoots.27Yang et al.28observed a metabolic balance between Cd uptake via ZIP transporters and efflux via CDF/HMA transporters, with NRAMP overexpression disrupting homeostasis through the saturation of ion channels. The dynamic equilibrium among these transporters, including the Golgi-localizedHMA4and the vacuolarMTP3, ultimately determines the specific Cd allocation patterns and tolerance thresholds of plants.

Cd exposure triggers complex physiological disruptions in plants, primarily resulting in growth retardation, morphological abnormalities, photosynthetic inhibition, and oxidative damage.

Plants mitigate heavy metal toxicity by secreting organic acids and other substances from their root systems, which alter metal bioavailability and promote microbial activities for synergistic detoxification.64Under Cd stress, plant roots release various organic acids, including citric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, and succinic acid.65These organic acids chelate ions to form stable, nontoxic complexes, and alleviate Cd toxicity through promoting plant growth and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity.66,67The specific organic acids released and their role in detoxification vary among plant species. InZea maysL., root Cd content was positively correlated with the secretion of acetic acid, oxalic acid, and glutamic acid.65Zhu et al.68reported that under Cd treatment, tomatoes promoted root secretion of oxalic and citric acids, with oxalate helping to mobilize Cd2+into the root system and improving Cd resistance. Sunflower showed a significant decrease in citrate levels under Cd stress, while malate and acetic acid levels increased.69InIpomoea batatasL., two ecotypes showed significant differences in Cd accumulation, which was closely related to the organic acids secreted by their roots. Notably, low Cd-accumulating varieties had a greater capacity for organic acid secretion than high Cd-accumulating types.70Xin et al.71found that under high Cd (10 µmol/L) treatment, low Cd varieties of pepper excreted significantly less tartaric acid and more oxalic and acetic acids compared to high Cd varieties, with no differences in citric or succinic acid levels between the two.

Under Cd stress, plants activate antioxidant defenses, but excessive exposure can impair this system, leading to its dysfunction and oxidative damage.103After 7 days of 150 µmol/L CdCl2treatment in wheat seedlings, SOD, CAT, APX, and GR increased initially (days 1–3), followed by progressive enzyme inactivation and 3.5-fold MDA accumulation, indicating lipid peroxidation.104Similar patterns occur inSolanum lycopersicumL.,105Oryza sativaL.,106Zea maysL.,107Brassica napusL.,108where Cd stress exceeded the tolerance threshold, causing antioxidant system irreversible damage.

Central to non-enzymatic defense, the AsA-GSH cycle dynamically regulates redox homeostasis by scavenging ROS and regenerating oxidized glutathione (GSSG), thereby reducing Cd2+toxicity.109InBrassica junceaL., 50 µmol/L CdCl₂ elevated AsA levels 121% (2.8 mg/g FW (control) to 6.2 mg/g FW) and dehydroascorbic acid reductase (DHAR) activity 3.1-fold within 72 h.110Zea maysL. roots under 100 µmol/L Cd2+stress expanded total glutathione pools 2.8-fold but collapsed GSH/GSSG ratios from 4.7 to 1.3 within 48 h, signaling redox buffer saturation.111These compensatory mechanisms fail when Cd exceeds species-specific thresholds, triggering AsA/GSH synthesis inhibition and irreversible oxidative damage.112Thus, enhancing the synthesis of ASA and GSH may be a promising strategy for improving Cd tolerance in plants.

Multi-omics insights into plant responses to cadmium stress.

Current research has elucidated key plant adaptive mechanisms to Cd stress, including rhizospheric modulation via organic acid exudates, cellular compartmentalization (vacuole and cell wall) mediated by ABCC transporters and HMA ATPases, and thiol-based chelation through phytochelatins (PCs) and metallothioneins (MTs). The integrated antioxidant system, comprising enzymatic components (SOD, CAT, APX) and the AsA-GSH cycle, demonstrates dose-dependent efficacy in neutralizing Cd-induced ROS. These mechanisms enable hyperaccumulators to tolerate elevated Cd concentrations while maintaining physiological functions.

Despite identifying critical transporters (e.g., ZIP, NRAMP, HMA) and chelators, their regulatory networks across developmental stages and environmental gradients remain incompletely characterized. Future efforts should prioritize multi-omics integration to dissect Cd sensing pathways, validate species-specific tolerance thresholds, and develop modular phytoremediation platforms combining transporter/chelator engineering (e.g., PCs/MTs overexpression) with rhizosphere microbiome management. While multi-omics technologies have provided mechanistic insights, data integration faces challenges due to the heterogeneity in experimental designs (e.g., growth stages, Cd exposure regimes). Addressing these challenges will enable precision strategies of Cd-contaminated ecosystems, ensuring agricultural safety and environmental sustainability.
