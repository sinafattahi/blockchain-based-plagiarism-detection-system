Aggregatibacterspecies are Gram-negative bacteria typically recognized as oral saprophytes in humans, with invasive infections uncommon in immunocompetent individuals. To the best our knowledge, this is the first reported case of subdural empyema attributed toAggregatibacter segnis(A. segnis).

A 50-year-old female was transferred to our hospital from a local facility due to headache, fever, and left-sided limb numbness. Initially suspected of subdural hematoma and viral encephalitis, she did not respond well to prior treatment. Cerebral computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a subdural lesion in the frontal-temporal region and sinusitis. Virus-related tests, smear, and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were negative. Craniotomy was performed to evacuate the subdual empyema, andA. segniswas detected in the culture of pus. The discrepancy between metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and culture highlights diagnostic challenges in this pretreated patient. Antibiotic treatment was guided by culture results and mNGS. Clinical symptoms resolved gradually following surgery and administration of antibiotics.

This rare case suggested thatA. segnisshould be considered in the diagnosis of subdural empyema. Multimodal diagnostics, prompt neurosurgical management, and individualized antimicrobial stewardship are crucial in managing rare central nervous system infections.

Subdural empyema, a life-threatening infection, accounts for nearly 20% of intracranial bacterial infections [1]. It most commonly occurs as a complication of sinusitis, sinus abscess, and meningitis, particularly in children. Prompt surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotics are crucial.Aggregatibacter segnis(A. segnis), formerly calledHaemophilus segnisand transferred to the genusAggregatibacterin 2006, is a gram-negative facultative anaerobic coccobacillus, which is rarely identified as a cause of invasive infections including endocarditis, appendicitis, and skin or soft tissue infections [2–15]. Reliable identification typically requires 16 S rRNA gene sequencing or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The infrequency of this species may be partly attributed to the challenges in differentiating it fromHaemophilus parainfluenzae[14], and its true prevalence is likely underestimated due to diagnostic limitations. To the best our knowledge, this is the first reported case of subdural empyema caused byA. segnis.

A previously healthy 50-year-old female presented with a 20-day history of headache, followed by two weeks of fever, and left-sided limb numbness persisting for 10 days prior to admission. She experienced chills and fever with temperatures fluctuating between 38 to 39.7℃, without nausea or vomiting. After antipyretic and analgesic treatment at a local hospital, her fever subsided but the headache worsened, accompanied by intermittent dysarthria and left-sided numbness affecting her face and limbs. The patient was subsequently transferred to our hospital for further treatment. She had no history of ear or nasal discharge, sinus pain, or head trauma. No exposure to animals and no skin infections were reported.

The patient was initially treated empirically with intravenous meropenem and vancomycin for one week prior to referral since she was allergic to cephalosporins. Upon admission, the temperature was 37℃. Cerebral computed tomography (CT) revealed an epidural or subdural lesion in the right frontotemporal area (Fig.1A). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a subdural rim-enhancing lesion and sinusitis (Fig.1B). Blood test showed hemoglobin of 98 g/L, white cell count of 8.29 × 109/L (75.8% neutrophils), platelet count of 373 × 109/L, and C-reactive protein of 36 mg/L (Table1). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis indicated white cell count of 39 × 106/L (2.6% polymorphonuclear, 97.4% monocytes) with normal glucose and protein levels (Table2). Both CSF and blood cultures showed no growth of bacteria, fungi, or mycobacteria. Nasal endoscopy showed purulent secretion from the right superior nasal meatus, no microbial growth was observed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Subdural empyema was suspected based on these findings.

Neurosurgical evacuation was performed involving drainage of the pus liquid, and removal of clots as well as necrosis tissues. Gram staining of the purulent material indicated a negative result. Intravenous antibiotic regimens of meropenem (2 g, three times a day) and vancomycin (1 g, twice a day) were administered pending culture results. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was also conducted on pus in view of prior empirical antibiotic treatment. Two days post-surgery, the mNGS indicated a possible infection involvingCapnocytophaga ochraceaandAggregatibacter aphrophilus, both of which are facultative anaerobes. Accordingly, antibiotics were adjusted to meropenem (2 g, three times a day) and metronidazole (0.5 g, three times a day). The patient’s symptoms improved progressively, and C-reactive protein levels normalized following surgery and administration of antibiotics. Six days post-surgery, anaerobic bacterial culture of pus yieldedA. segnis, which was inconsistent with mNGS findings. Pus samples were cultured anaerobically on Brucella blood agar at 37 °C for 72 h. Colonies were initially identified using MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Biotyper system; score ≥ 2.0), and the result was subsequently confirmed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The obtained 16 S rRNA sequence showed > 99.8% identity to the reference genome ofAggregatibacter segnisATCC 33,393 (GenBank assembly accession: GCF_000185305.1).

After two weeks of treatment, significant improvement in the patient’s symptoms was observed. With normal imaging and blood test results, the patient was soon discharged from the hospital. An additional two weeks of antibiotic treatment was required after discharge. The patient received a total of 21 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy (including the preoperative course), followed by 14 days of oral antibiotics, completing 5-week course of antimicrobial treatment. Specifically, a follow-up CT scan (Fig.1D) was performed on postoperative Day 28 and MRI (Fig.2) was obtained on Day 60 to assess treatment response. During the follow-up, no further symptoms were reported.

We present a rare case of subdural empyema caused byA. segnis. Although the patient exhibited no clinical symptoms of sinusitis, preoperative MRI revealed sinus inflammation, which is considered the likely source of the intracranial infection [1]. The patient achieved full recovery following craniotomy for evacuation of subdural pus and clot, combined with antibiotic therapy.

Aggregatibacterspecies reside as commensals on mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx [3,6,16].Aggregatibactergenus comprises four species includingAggregatibacter aphrophilus,Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,Aggregatibacter segnis, andAggregatibacter kilianiinewly proposed in 2018 [17].Haemophilus segniswas proposed by Kilian et al. in 1976 [15]. The first reported case of invasive infection caused byHaemophilus segniswas published by Bullock et al., involving a pancreatic abscess and septicemia [2]. To date, 12 studies have documented a total of 26 cases ofA. segnisinfection (Table3). MostA. segnisinfections occurred in adult patients, with a wide age range from 9 to 82 years and a slight male predominance (16 males vs. 10 females). The most common infection sites included the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., appendicitis, cholecystitis), skin and soft tissues (e.g., abscesses, diabetic foot, necrotizing fasciitis), respiratory tract infections, and the cardiovascular system (e.g., endocarditis). While outcomes were generally favorable with appropriate surgical and antibiotic management, there were still four reported fatalities, emphasizing the potential severity ofA. segnisinfections (Table3) [2–13].

Subdural empyema is a potentially fatal complication often associated with sinusitis if not promptly and appropriately managed [1,18]. In this case, sinusitis was identified on preoperative imaging and is considered the likely source of subdural empyema. Although ipsilateral sinusitis on preoperative MRI and purulent secretion in the right superior nasal meatus strongly suggest a sinus origin, alternative routes such as hematogenous spread from undetected oral, dental, or skin sources cannot be definitively ruled out. The patient denied recent dental work, head trauma, or systemic infections, and showed no signs of otitis, mastoiditis, or soft tissue infection. Blood cultures were negative. Overall, sinusitis remains the most plausible source given the anatomical proximity and imaging findings, though other occult sources cannot be completely excluded. WhileStaphylococcus aureusandstreptococciare the most frequently reported pathogens in subdural empyema, this case highlights the need to considerA. segnisas a potential causative organism. Although the temperature returned to normal with empirical antibiotic treatment, the patient suffered progressively worsening symptoms of headache, dysarthria, and limb numbness. Neuroimagings like CT and MRI are essential when intracranial infection is suspected [18]. In this case, preoperative imaging revealed a mass effect in the right frontotemporal region, consistent with the patient’s clinical presentation. An elevated C-reactive protein level further supported the diagnosis of an ongoing infection. Surgical drainage with antibiotic therapy is imperative for managing subdural empyema [1,18]. The patient underwent craniotomy for evacuation of pus and clot. In light of prior antibiotic use, pus samples were submitted for both bacterial culture and mNGS to optimize pathogen identification.

The patient’s allergy to cephalosporins significantly influenced antibiotic choice. Due to the risk of anaphylaxis, we avoided cephalosporins like cefepime or ceftazidime. Instead, we opted for meropenem, which provides broad-spectrum coverage, and does not cross-react with cephalosporins. Since meropenem alone would cover most anaerobes, metronidazole was added to the antibiotic regimen following the preliminary mNGS results, which suggested possible involvement ofCapnocytophaga ochracea, a facultative anaerobic bacterium often associated with polymicrobial infections and known to be susceptible to metronidazole. At that time,A. segnishad not yet been identified. OnceA. segniswas confirmed by anaerobic culture and its susceptibility profile was clarified, the metronidazole was stopped.

mNGS has emerged as a promising method for diagnosing pathogens in infectious diseases, boasting higher detection rates compared to conventional methods [19]. However, in this case, the result of mNGS was not consistent with pus culture. Several factors likely contributed to the discrepancy between the anaerobic culture result (identifyingA. segnis) and the mNGS findings (reportingCapnocytophaga ochraceaandA. aphrophilus). First, the patient had received empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and vancomycin, for one week prior to surgical specimen collection. As demonstrated in Zhang et al., while mNGS can outperform culture in detecting pathogens post-antibiotic exposure, delayed sampling (particularly more than 4 days after initiation of effective therapy) significantly decreases the detection rate of both methods [20]. Additionally, mNGS limitations, including potential contamination from environmental contamination, reagent-derived background noise, database incompleteness for rare anaerobes, and difficulty distinguishing closely related species. AsA. segnisis phylogenetically close toA. aphrophilusand other oral anaerobes, sequence homology or mapping ambiguity may have led to misclassification or partial matching during automated annotation. The efficiency of DNA extraction and the degradation of bacterial DNA due to prior antibiotic treatment may have lowered the sensitivity of mNGS. Background human DNA or reagent contamination can also interfere with pathogen detection. This case emphasizes the need for multimodal diagnostic approaches to improve sensitivity and accuracy in complex infections. Combining mNGS with culture methods ensures a broader detection range, especially for fastidious organisms or low-burden infections. Early sample collection and the use of both techniques can significantly improve diagnostic yield and avoid missing potential pathogens [13,20,21].

This rare case of subdural empyema caused byA. segnishighlights key clinical lessons. Despite the growing role of mNGS, conventional anaerobic culture remains essential for detecting uncommon pathogens that may be missed or misidentified by sequencing. The discordance between mNGS and culture results underscores the influence of sampling timing and prior antibiotic exposure on diagnostic accuracy. Timely surgical intervention was critical for source control and recovery. Additionally, antibiotic stewardship should carefully balance broad-spectrum empiric therapy with susceptibility-guided de-escalation, especially in patients with drug allergies. Overall, this case underscores the importance of integrating multiple diagnostic modalities and individualized therapeutic strategies in managing CNS infections.
