To explore the expression of miR-135a-3p in prostate cancer，analyze its effects on tumor development and the involved mechanisms. A total of 125 specimens of cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues from prostate cancer patients were collected. Real – Time quantitative PCR was employed to quantify the expression levels of miR-135a-3p in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and Cox regression were performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of miR-135a-3p in prostate cancer. The CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the targeting interaction between miR-135a-3p and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). miR-135a-3p is lowly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cells, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis of patients. The low expression state of miR-135a-3p showed a significant correlation with TNM stage, clinical stage, Gleason score, and lymph node metastasis. In addition, miR-135a-3p inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and cancer progression by negatively regulating the expression of TLR4. miR-135a-3p is downregulated in prostate cancer and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. It exerts an inhibitory effect on the progression of prostate cancer by targeting TLR4.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common male genitourinary malignancies.1In recent years, fueled by the global acceleration of population aging and shifts in lifestyle patterns, the incidence of prostate cancer has shown a significant upward trend.2,3In China, this trend is similarly evident, with the disease emerging as a major concern in the field of urology.4Despite significant advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, many patients continue to experience poor outcomes, including disease recurrence and metastasis.5,6Consequently, identifying more effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and exploring new therapeutic targets are crucial to improving patient prognosis.

In recent years, a growing body of research has underscored the pivotal role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the initiation, progression, diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic evaluation of tumors, positioning them as critical focal points in oncology research.7,8Research indicates that miR-301a expression could serve as a promising biomarker for metastasis in prostate cancer patients.9miR-1273 g-3p promotes the malignant progression of prostate cancer and has prognostic significance.10Conversely, miR-1207-5p inhibits PYCR1 expression and suppresses prostate cancer progression by impeding cell growth.11As a representative of the miRNA family, miR-135a-3p exhibits abnormal expression in the various tumors, and plays a key role in regulating the biological behaviors of cancer cells.12Notably, it has been documented that the expression of miR-135a is downregulated in metastatic breast cancer and prostate tumors, with miR-135a acting to inhibit cancer cell invasion.13Importantly, miR-135a-3p has emerged as a noteworthy biomarker capable of differentiating between indolent and aggressive forms of prostate cancer.14Earlier studies suggest an association between abnormal miR-135a-3p expression and prostate cancer, but the specific expression and potential mechanism of miR-135a-3p need further exploration.

This study intends to investigate miR-135a-3p expression in prostate cancer, analyze its impact on the occurrence and development of prostate cancer and the mechanism of action, and provide new ideas and directions for the early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

A total of 125 specimens, comprising cancerous tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues from prostate cancer patients who underwent surgical resection at The First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between February 2018 and February 2020, were meticulously collected. The age distribution of the patients ranged from 50 to 79 years. All patients underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. After obtaining the samples, they were quickly placed in liquid nitrogen for transfer and then stored in a −80°C refrigerator for long-term preservation. None of these tissue samples had received anti-tumor treatments such as preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy before the surgery. Informed consent was obtained from the patients for all the collected samples, and the samples had passed the review of the hospital’s ethics committee.

The clinical, pathological, and laboratory data of patients were meticulously gathered through the electronic medical record system. This comprehensive dataset primarily encompassed variables such as age, tumor stage, Gleason score, degree of differentiation, the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, among other relevant parameters.

The patients were monitored starting from the day of diagnosis. Follow-up assessments were conducted through various channels, including outpatient reexaminations, WeChat communication, and telephone consultations. The follow-up was conducted once every three months, and the follow-up period is 5 years. The follow-up would be terminated when the patient died.

The human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, VCaP, 22RV1), the complete RPMI 1640 culture medium (supplemented 10% FBS), the normal epithelial cells of human prostate cancer tissues (RWPE-1) and the corresponding special complete culture medium were all purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The culture was maintained under controlled conditions at 37.0°C with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO₂. Cells were subjected to enzymatic digestion using trypsin for a duration of 3 to 4 minutes. Passaging was performed at a 1:2 ratio, with the culture medium being replaced every 2 to 3 days to ensure optimal cell growth and maintenance.

Transfection and co-transfection were carried out utilizing the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. PC-3 and DU145 cell lines were categorized into several groups: a control group (un-transfected), a mimic negative control (mimics NC) group, a miR-135a-3p mimics group, an inhibitor negative control (inhibitor NC) group, and a miR-135a-3p inhibitor group. In the co-transfection experiments, the miR-135a-3p mimics + OE-NC group (co-transfected with miR-135a-3p mimics and pcDNA3.1 vector) was set as the control to exclude the interference of irrelevant variables in the experimental system. The group co-transfected with miR-135a-3p mimics and pcDNA3.1-TLR4 construct was designated as the miR-135a-3p mimics + OE-TLR4 group. After 48 hours of transfection, RT – qPCR was carried out to measure the expression levels of miR-135a-3p and TLR4 in cells.

The homogenized tissues and cells from each group were meticulously collected, followed by the extraction of total RNA utilizing Trizol reagent. The quality of the resultant RNA samples was assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Only those RNA samples deemed qualified, characterized by an A260 nm/A280 nm ratio between 1.8 and 2.0 and a concentration within the range of 100–500 mg/L, were selected for the subsequent reverse transcription process to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA). The procedures for cDNA synthesis and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were conducted in accordance with the protocols outlined in the TransScriptⓇ II Probe One-Step RT-qPCR SuperMix kit. The relative expression levels of the miR-135a-3p and TLR4 genes were quantified utilizing the 2−△△Ctmethod.

The cells from each group were harvested and subjected to trypsin digestion. Subsequently, they were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104cells/mL, ensuring three replicates for each group. The plates were incubated in a 37°C incubator for 6–8 hours. After the cells had adhered to the wells, 10% CCK − 8 reagent was added, and the cells were further incubated for 2 hours. The optical density (OD) values at 450 nm were measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Cell proliferation curves were subsequently generated based on the recorded OD values.

The TargetScanHuman software was utilized to investigate the targeting relationship and predict the binding sites between miR-135a-3p and TLR4 through an online analysis. Subsequently, we constructed the vectors for both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) forms of the TLR4 3’-UTR. These constructs were then co-transfected into PC-3 or DU145 cells alongside miR-135a-3p mimics (50 nmol/L) or negative control mimics (mimics NC, 50 nmol/L), as well as miR-135a-3p inhibitors (50 nmol/L) or negative control inhibitors (inhibitor NC, 50 nmol/L). After a cultivation period of 48 hours, we assessed the luciferase activity of the cells using the manufacturer’s protocol provided with the kit.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 26.0. Measurement data, following a normality test, were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The independent samples t-test was used for comparisons between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for comparisons among multiple groups. Categorical data are presented as the number of cases (n), and the chi-square test was used for intergroup comparisons. In addition, the Bonferroni method was employed for multiple comparison correction when performing pairwise comparisons among multiple groups.P＜0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The expression of miR-135a-3p was notably lower in tumor tissues from prostate cancer patients than in adjacent tissues (p< .001) (Figure 1(A)). Patients were stratified into low (n= 65) and high (n= 60) miR-135a-3p expression groups according to the mean miR-135a-3p expression in cancer tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis of 5-year follow-up data revealed that patients with low miR-135a-3p expression had markedly shorter survival times than those with high expression (Log-rankp= .012) (Figure 1(B)).

The survival time of patients with low expression of miR-135a-3p is significantly shorter than that of patients with high expression of miR-135a-3p (log-rankp= .012) (B). ***P＜0.001.

The results of the correlation analysis between the expression of miR-135a-3p and the pathological characteristics of prostate cancer are shown inTable 1. The study found that there was no significant correlation between the expression level of miR-135a-3p and the patient’s age, body mass index (BMI), PSA level, and tumor differentiation degree (p> .05). Conversely, notably low expression of miR-135a-3p shows a strong link with TNM stage, clinical stage, Gleason score and lymph node metastasis (p< .05).

Cox regression analysis was performed using the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer as the dependent variable and the expression of miR-135a-3p in cancer tissues as the independent variable. The results showed that poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer was influenced by the expression of miR-135a-3p in cancer tissues, the Gleason score, and lymph node metastasis (p< .05) (Table 2).

The expression level of miR-135a-3p was significantly lower in prostate cancer cell lines than in the RWPE-1 cell line (p< .01). Its expression levels in PC-3 and DU145 cells were relatively lower (p< .001) (Figure 2(A)). Therefore, PC3 and DU145 cells were selected as the subjects for further in-depth study. To elucidate the potential biological functions of miR-135a-3p in prostate cancer, we conducted transfection experiments in PC-3 and DU145 cells aimed at achieving both overexpression and knockdown of miR-135a-3p. RT-qPCR results showed that, compared with the control group, the expression level of miR-135a-3p was significantly higher in cells that had undergone miR-135a-3p mimic transfection. In contrast, the expression level was substantially lower in cells that had undergone miR-135a-3p inhibitor transfection (p< .001) (Figure 2(B)). Furthermore, the results of the cell proliferation assays showed that the miR-135a-3p mimic notably inhibited the proliferation of both PC-3 and DU145 cells, relative to the control group. In contrast, the miR-135a-3p inhibitor promoted PC-3 cell proliferation (p< .01) (Figure 2(C-D)).

Effect of miR-135a-3p on proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The expression level of miR-135a-3p in prostate cancer cell lines was significantly lower than that in normal prostate epithelial cells (p< .01). Among these prostate cancer cell lines, the expression levels of miR-135a-3p in PC3 and DU145 cells were relatively low (p< .001) (A). RT-qPCR is used to detect the expression of miR-135a-3p to verify the transfection efficiency (B). The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the effect of miR-135a-3p expression on cell proliferation (C-D). **P＜0.01, ***P＜0.001.

The results of bioinformatics prediction indicate that there are potential binding sites between miR-135a-3p and TLR4 (Figure 3(A)). Further verification through the luciferase reporter gene assay reveals that in PC3 and DU145 cells, the luciferase activity significantly decreases only when the miR-135a-3p mimic is co-transfected with the wild-type TLR4 3‘UTR (p< .01) (Figure 3(B-C)). Moreover, the research indicated that TLR4 mRNA levels were notably increased in prostate cancer tissues relative to adjacent tissues (p< .001) (Figure 3(D)). The correlation analysis revealed a substantial inverse relationship between the expression of miR-135a-3p and TLR4 in prostate cancer tissues (r= −0.797,p< .001) (Figure 3(E)). In PC3 and DU145 cells, the expression of TLR4 mRNA was markedly reduced in the miR-135a-3p mimic transfection group compared to the control group, while a significant increase in TLR4 mRNA levels was observed in the miR-135a-3p inhibitor transfection group (p< .05) (Figure 3(F)).

This study verified the targeted regulatory link between miR-135a-3p and TLR4 in prostate cancer. To comprehensively explore how miR-135a-3p targeting TLR4 impacts prostate cancer progression, co – transfection experiments were conducted to overexpress TLR4 in PC3 and DU145 cells. RT-qPCR results showed that in PC3 cells, miR-135a-3p expression significantly increased in the mimic transfection group relative to the control, whereas TLR4 mRNA levels decreased substantially (p< .01). Conversely, in the group co-transfected with the miR-135a-3p mimic and the TLR4 overexpression vector (OE-TLR4), no significant alteration in the expression of miR-135a-3p was observed; however, the mRNA expression level of TLR4 was significantly elevated (p< .01) (Figure 4(A-B)). Further cell proliferation assays revealed that the transfection of miR-135a-3p mimic notably inhibited the proliferative capacity of the cells when compared to the control group, whereas the overexpression of TLR4 diminished this inhibitory effect (p< .01) (Figure 4(C)). A similar regulatory pattern also exists in DU145 cells, and the impact of miR-135a-3p targeting TLR4 on cell proliferation shows consistency in the two cell lines (Figure 4(D-F)).

Research has demonstrated that miRNAs are crucial in modulating cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis in cancer cells.15,16Generally, the abnormally expressed miRNA profiles in tumor tissues or specific miRNAs can be used for the diagnosis of cancer, as well as the personalized treatment and prognosis assessment of cancer patients.17,18Research indicates that miR-324 could potentially serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.19miR-21 has the potential to act as an efficient biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis.20Recent studies have demonstrated a marked decrease in the levels of miR-139-5p in prostate cancer tissues, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.21Similarly, our investigation revealed that reduced expression levels of miR-135a-3p were present in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Studies have indicated that miRNAs often function through synergistic networks in tumors.22In the future, the accuracy of diagnosis and prognostic evaluation can be improved by jointly detecting multiple miRNAs, and their synergistic regulatory networks are worthy of in-depth exploration. Notably, our results further demonstrate that the expression level of miR-135a-3p is significantly correlated with the pathological features of prostate cancer patients. Moreover, survival analysis indicates that prostate cancer patients with low miR-135a-3p expression have a poor prognosis. The results of our study have revealed the important role of the expression of miR-135a-3p in prostate cancer, providing new ideas and potential targets for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis assessment of prostate cancer.

Research has demonstrated that the decreased expression of miR-139-5p drives prostate cancer progression through the regulation of SOX5.21On the contrary, miR-515-5p demonstrates significant tumor – suppressive capabilities in prostate cancer through its targeted regulation of TRIP13.23In addition, the research findings demonstrate that miR-154 exerts an inhibitory effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells by specifically targeting CCND2.24Our study results demonstrate that miR-135a-3p potently inhibits the proliferation of prostate cells, yet this inhibitory effect is markedly counteracted by TLR4. TLR4 assumes a pivotal role in the onset and development of prostate cancer.25Multiple research findings indicate that TLR4 is commonly present in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines, and the level of its expression is strongly linked to the malignancy of the tumor.26,27Some studies have shown that the activation of TLR4 promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.28This study clearly identified the targeting relationship between miR-135a-3p and TLR4, adding new molecular-level evidence to the research on the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

As a key molecule linking inflammation and tumor progression, the activation status of TLR4 downstream signaling pathways represents a central link in mediating the malignant phenotypes of tumors.29After being activated by ligands, TLR4 initiates downstream signaling cascades via the adaptor protein MyD88, ultimately leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB(p65), which promotes the transcription of proinflammatory factors and proangiogenic factors.30Previous studies have confirmed that sustained activation of the NF-κB pathway is a key driver of prostate cancer progression.31Thus, we hypothesize that in the present study, the inhibition of TLR4 expression by miR-135a-3p may suppress the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB(p65) by reducing the binding of MyD88 to TLR4. Subsequent studies need to combine molecular experiments and animal models to systematically analyze the activation status of these pathways, thereby providing a more precise theoretical basis for the clinical translation of miR-135a-3p.

The core limitations of this study lie in the insufficient exploration of the regulatory mechanism and the absence of in vivo validation, which may significantly affect the reliability and generalizability of the conclusions. On the one hand, although TLR4 is a key molecule in the inflammatory signaling pathway, the specific impact of its inhibition on downstream signal transduction remains unclear, leading to an incomplete understanding of the molecular network of the “miR-135a-3p-TLR4” axis in regulating tumor progression and making it difficult to rule out the synergistic effects of other potential target genes or pathways. On the other hand, the study relied solely on clinical sample analysis and in vitro cell experiments, lacking in vivo model validation. Future research will conduct multi-center prospective clinical studies to analyze the changes in the activity of TLR4 downstream pathways and clarify the specific signal transduction chain by which miR-135a-3p inhibits tumor progression. Combined with the results of animal experiments, the clinical value of miR-135a-3p as a biomarker and therapeutic target will be further verified, providing a more solid theoretical basis for its clinical translation.

To conclude, the expression level of miR-135a-3p is closely associated with the malignant biological behaviors of prostate cancer and patient prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Meanwhile, its mechanism of regulating tumor progression by targeting TLR4 provides a theoretical basis for developing therapeutic strategies targeting miR-135a-3p or TLR4. However, the relevant clinical translational value still needs to be further verified by larger-sample prospective cohort studies, in vivo animal experiments, and clinical trials.
