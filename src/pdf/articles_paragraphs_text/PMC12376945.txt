Twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) is a critical mechanism influencing the emission efficiency and stability of fluorescent materials, thereby playing a pivotal role in the design of highly fluorescent and stable dyes. Although substantial research has concentrated on the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in excited-state dynamics, the impact of intramolecular hydrogen bonding has not been thoroughly investigated. To elucidate the solvent polarity dependence of C7 and C30, we employed the Kamlet–Taft and Catalán 4P models in conjunction with steady-state and transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Our findings demonstrate that C30 exhibits a pronounced TICT process in both solvents. Conversely, C7, stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, retains a planar configuration of its benzimidazole and benzopyrone moieties, effectively preventing the TICT process. Moreover, in MeOH, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in C30 significantly extends the lifetime of the TICT state compared to ACN. Theoretical analyses of electrostatic potential, molecular geometry, and frontier molecular orbitals further corroborate these observations. This work provides valuable insights into the design of fluorescent dye molecules and the selection of solvents, laying a foundation for advancing the photophysical and photochemical understanding of coumarin dyes.

Spectroscopic experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that C30 exhibits TICT, while C7 maintains a planar structure due to intramolecular H-bonding, thereby suppressing TICT. This finding advances the understanding of coumarin photophysics.

Fluorescent dyes are rapidly transitioning from a trial-and-error approach to a molecular engineering strategy. Increasing evidence suggests that twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) has emerged as a key mechanism for achieving the design of highly fluorescent and stable dyes.1–9The TICT process is characterized by charge transfer (CT) between donor and acceptor groups within a molecule upon photoexcitation, accompanied by molecular twisting. Understanding of this process is vital for elucidating the photophysical behavior of dye molecules. The TICT model, initially proposed by Grabowskiet al., accounts for the dual fluorescence phenomenon, attributing high fluorescence to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and low fluorescence to the TICT state, as observed in DMABN molecules.10Since its inception, this model has been instrumental in exploring TICT behavior across various fluorescent materials, enabling significant improvements in emission efficiency by controlling the transition from non-emissive to emissive states. These advancements have expanded the application of fluorescent materials in fields such as bioimaging, sensors, and fluorescent probes.11–19Recent studies have shown the substantial impact of hydrogen bonding on intramolecular charge distribution in fluorescent molecules, which directly influences their fluorescent properties and the formation of TICT states.20–28Hydrogen bonds can alter the excited-state structure of molecules, thereby affecting the formation of ICT or TICT states. Therefore, understanding the influence of hydrogen bonding on the TICT process is crucial for designing efficient fluorescent materials.

Coumarins and their derivatives, particularly the 7-amino-substituted variants, represent a significant class of benzopyranone-based organic fluorescent dyes with widespread research interest.29,30These dyes exhibit unique fluorescent properties under various conditions, making them valuable in studying photophysical processes. Their fluorescence is highly sensitive to solvent polarity, viscosity, and temperature, allowing them to serve as fluorescent probes for monitoring subtle changes in chemical and biological processes. Notably, these dyes demonstrate pronounced solvent-polarity-dependent Stokes shifts upon photoexcitation, with Kamlet–Taft (K–T) solvent parameters (π*,α,β) providing further insights into the role of hydrogen bonding on the excited-state dynamics of coumarin dyes.31Further research indicates that 7-amino-substituted coumarin derivatives exhibit higher dipole moments, red-shifted spectra, and enhanced quantum yields in polar solvents, highlighting their potential as fluorescent probes.32,33For instance, Chudobaet al.employed femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy to study the excited-state dynamics of hydrogen-bonded complexes of coumarin 102 in trichloromethane and phenol, revealing a significant enhancement of hydrogen bonding upon photoexcitation.34In 2004, Senthilkumaret al.discovered that the TICT state of coumarin 30 (C30) exclusively exists in highly polar protic solvents, a phenomenon closely linked to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.35Further, in 2009, Satpatiet al.elucidated the crucial role of protic solvents in facilitating the formation of the TICT state in coumarin 7 (C7) dyes through studies in various protic solvents and solvent mixtures.30Barmanet al., in 2013, combined time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate coumarin 102 hydrogen-bonded complexes, finding that hydrogen bonding promoted the excited-state ICT process.36Liet al.through TDDFT studies, further demonstrated that hydrogen bonding facilitates the formation of the TICT process in coumarin dyes such as C460.23Geet al.conducted ultrafast excited-state dynamics studies on ICT and enhanced hydrogen bonding in the excited state for coumarin 540A and 503 across a range of solvents.15,37Despite extensive literature, many aspects of the photophysical properties of 7-amino coumarin dyes, particularly the influence of molecular structure on excited-state dynamics and the role of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in CT processes, remain insufficiently explored. Addressing these critical issues will not only deepen our understanding of the photophysical behavior of coumarin dyes but also provide a robust theoretical foundation for the development of novel fluorescent probes and sensors.

This study investigates the ultrafast dynamics of two structurally analogous coumarin dyes, C7 and C30 (Fig. 1), distinguished by the substitution of the NH group in the 3-benzimidazole moiety of C7 with an NCH3group in C30. Solvents with varying polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities were selected to investigate the impact of hydrogen bonding on the excited-state dynamics of the molecules. Ground- and excited-state structures of the hydrogen-bonded complexes were optimized using TDDFT. Theoretical analyses, including electronic spectra, electrostatic potential (ESP), and frontier molecular orbitals, were conducted to support and interpret the experimental findings. This integrative approach elucidates the mechanism underlying the formation of TICT states, offering crucial insights into the photophysics of coumarin dyes and advancing the design of next-generation fluorescent probes and sensors.

The C7 and C30 molecular samples (purity > 95.0%) were purchased from Aladdin Inc. and used without further purification. Anhydrous, spectroscopic-grade cyclohexane (Cy), tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH), and other solvents were sourced from Macklin Inc. C7 and C30 were dissolved in these solvents, respectively, at concentrations of 80 μmol L−1, which were subsequently placed in 10 mm path length quartz cuvettes. Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra, as well as quantum yields (QYs), were recorded using a FluoroMax+ spectrofluorometer (Horiba). TA spectra were acquired using a femtosecond pump–probe setup consisting of an Astrella femtosecond laser (Coherent), a TOPAS-Prime optical parametric amplifier (Coherent), and a Transpec FS pump–probe system (Zhongzhi Keyi). The femtosecond laser generated 800 nm pulses (1 kHz, 35 fs) that were split in a 7 : 3 ratio. The stronger pulse was used to generate 375 nm pump pulsesviathe optical parametric amplifier, while the weaker pulse formed the probe beam. The probe and pump beams were spatially overlapped at the sample position. TA spectra were collected using a spectrometer calibrated in both wavelength and intensity with a standard argon lamp, and further chirp correction was implemented to precisely determine the timing of the transient spectra. The absorbance change is given byeqn (1), whereIpumpprobeandI0proberepresent the probe signal intensities with and without the pump pulse applied to the sample, respectively. All measurements were conducted at room temperature and ambient pressure.

This study aims to elucidate the role of both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding in modulating the excited-state dynamics of C7 and C30 hydrogen-bonded complexes. The solvatochromism was studied by using the Kamlet–Taft model40,41and the Catalán 4P model,42the relevant parameters are shown in Table S1.

The normalized steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of C7 and C30 in Cy, THF, AN, and MeOH are presented inFig. 2. Specifically, C7 exhibits absorption maxima in Cy, THF, ACN and MeOH were 422 nm, 431 nm, 440 nm and 445 nm respectively, with corresponding fluorescence maxima at 459 nm, 480 nm, 490 nm, and 494 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). With the enhancement of the solvent polarity, the absorption and fluorescence peak of C7 showed a slight redshift. A similar trend is observed for C30, aligning with the findings of Satpatiet al.TDDFT calculations were also performed to analyze the electronic excitation energies and oscillator strengths for the S0-to-S1transitions of C7 and C30 in ACN and MeOH. The TDDFT results (Table 1) indicate that the oscillator strengths corresponding to the S1states of C7 and C30 in ACN and MeOH are the greatest, the S1state is derived from the transition between HOMO and LUMO, with orbital transition contributions exceeding 98%. The calculated absorption maxima for C7–ACN, C7–MeOH, C30–ACN, and C30–MeOH are 423 nm, 425 nm, 397 nm, and 404 nm, respectively. Moreover, the TDDFT calculated fluorescence emission energies and corresponding oscillator strengths for C7 and C30 in ACN and MeOH are provided inTable 2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the oscillator strength corresponding to the S1state of the hydrogen bond complexes C7–ACN, C7–MeOH, C30–ACN and C30–MeOH is the largest, indicating that the fluorescence maxima of these complexes originate from the S1state. The predicted emission wavelengths are 490 nm, 494 nm, 478 nm, and 481 nm, respectively, which are in close agreement with the experimentally observed fluorescence peaks summarized inTable 3. This consistency highlights the reliability of the theoretical approach in accurately capturing the excited-state dynamics of the investigated systems.

To gain deeper insight into the solvatochromic behavior of C7 and C30, we expanded the solvent set to include additional nonpolar, moderately polar, and highly polar solvents. The relevant solvent parameters are provided in the SI (Table S1). The absorption and emission maxima of C7 and C30 under different solvents were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer. As shown in Table S2, both dyes exhibit pronounced redshifts in their absorption and emission peaks as solvent polarity increases. These trends are further supported by the spectral data inFig. 2, which illustrate the absorption and emission profiles of C7 and C30 in representative solvents (Cy, THF, ACN, and MeOH), confirming that both molecules exhibit clear solvent-induced spectral shifts consistent with solvatochromic behavior.

Further support is provided by structural parameters in Table S3 and Fig. S1, the N1–H1and H1–O1bond lengths in the S0state are 1.017 Å and 2.021 Å, respectively. Upon excitation to the S1state, N1–H1slightly elongates (1.019 Å), while H1–O1shortens (1.972 Å), indicating that when the molecule is excited to the S1state, the hydrogen bond interaction is enhanced, which provides impetus for promoting the ESIPT process. In ACN and MeOH solvents, from S0to S1state, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds O1–H2strengthen, whereas the intramolecular hydrogen bond N1–H1remains nearly unchanged (Δ= 0.001 Å). When the C7 monomers, C7–ACN and C7–MeOH, are excited to the S1state, H1–O1shortens (Δ= 0.049 Å, 0.013 Å, 0.007 Å), suggesting that non-polar environments promote ESIPT by enhancing the excited-state hydrogen bonding interactions of C7.45To further prove that intermolecular hydrogen bonds hinder the ESIPT process, we conducted potential energy surface molecular analysis on C7–MeOH, as shown in Fig. S2. In the S0state, as the bond lengths of N1–H1increase, the relative energy does not show a decreasing trend. When the bond length grows to 2.6 Å, the energy is the greatest. Similarly, in the S1state, the bond lengths of N1–H1increase from 1.0 Å to 2.6 Å, and the energy shows an upward trend, indicating that the ESIPT process is effectively blocked in C7–MeOH.

The coefficientss,a, andb, derived from LSER analysis, indicate the relative contributions of these solvent properties to the observed spectral shifts. It can be seen from the fitting results inTable 4thatα,βand π* all have an impact on C7 and C30.

The fitting results are shown inTable 4, compared with the K–T model, the Catalán 4P model describes the non-specific interactions more precisely and has a better goodness of fit, further demonstrating the solvent-induced coloration phenomenon of C7 and C30.

Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating laser-induced ultrafast excited-state dynamics.50,51To explore the effects of structural differences between C7 and C30, as well as the influence of solvent hydrogen-donating ability (α), we measured the fs-TA spectra of C7 and C30 in ACN and MeOH. To visualize the evolution of the fs-TA spectra, 2D contour maps were generated (Fig. 3), with the horizontal axis representing the probe wavelength (375–675 nm) and the vertical axis indicating the time delay (0–3 ns). Red denotes positive signals, blue corresponds to negative signals, and the intensity of the color reflects the relative signal strength. Both C7 and C30 exhibit excited-state absorption (ESA) in the 375–450 nm range and stimulated emission (SE) in the 470–550 nm range.

The fs-TA spectra of C7 and C30 in different solvents are depicted inFig. 4. For C7, a pronounced negative signal is detected in the 450–600 nm range during the initial 0–0.4 ps of evolution. At 0.8 ps, the wavelength of this negative signal stabilizes at 514 nm and 508 nm. Subsequently, after 100 ps, the intensity of the negative signal reaches its maximum before gradually decreasing. For C30, a similar negative signal is observed in the 460–600 nm range during the first 0–0.5 ps. The insets of panels (c) and (d) inFig. 4provide a clearer visualization of the temporal evolution of the TA spectra between 0.6 ps and 1.2 ps. During this interval, the negative signal peaks of C30 in ACN and MeOH shift from 490 nm and 492 nm to 498 nm and 503 nm, respectively. In contrast, no such spectral shift is observed for C7. This redshift, occurring around 200 fs, is attributed to the structural relaxation associated with the transition from the ICT state to the TICT state. This process is analogous to that reported by Mandalet al.in the transient absorption spectra of DMAPPIDCN molecules in ACN.52Moreover, theoretical calculations indicate a change in the dihedral angle of C30 in the S1state changes, providing further evidence for the presence of the TICT process in highly polar solvents such as ACN and MeOH.

At room temperature and pressure, the fluorescence quantum yields (QYs) of C7 and C30 in ACN and MeOH were measured using a FluoroMax+ spectrofluorometer. The results, summarized inTable 6, show that the QYs for C7 in ACN (87%), C7 in MeOH (97%), C30 in ACN (78%), and C30 in MeOH (60%) exhibit distinct differences. Notably, the QYs for C30 in both solvents are significantly lower than those for C7. This reduction in quantum yield for C30 is attributed to the presence of the TICT process within the C30 molecule, as evidenced by transient absorption spectra and TDDFT calculations. Furthermore, the reduced quantum yield of C30 in MeOH compared to ACN is primarily due to hydrogen bonding between C30 and MeOH molecules, which stabilizes the TICT state and consequently diminishes fluorescence emission efficiency.

ESP analysis is a reliable tool for identifying the regions of hydrogen bond formation between solute and solvent molecules.15,37Fig. S3 presents the ESP maps for C7, C30, ACN, and MeOH. Red regions correspond to low ESP, indicating areas of high electronegativity and nucleophilicity, while blue regions represent high ESP, characteristic of low electronegativity and electrophilicity. The CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019N groups in both C7 and C30 are marked by deep red regions, reflecting their strong electron-withdrawing characteristics. Since nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, nitrogen atoms in these groups exhibit stronger electron-withdrawing capabilities. In C30, the distance between the methyl group's carbon atom and the oxygen atom exceeds 3 Å in both the ground and excited states, preventing intramolecular hydrogen bond formation. Conversely, C7 forms a stable N–H⋯O hydrogen bond. The O–H group in MeOH appears as a deep blue region, reflecting its strong electron-donating capability as a protonic solvent and its role as a hydrogen bond donor. In contrast, the C–H group in ACN is depicted in light blue, indicating weak electron-donating ability. Therefore, both C7 and C30 can form hydrogen bonds in MeOH at two sites: one at the carbonyl oxygen (C–O⋯H) and the other at the nitrogen atom in the benzimidazole group (C–N⋯H).

To further investigate the redistribution of electron density upon excitation to the S1state, we performed frontier molecular orbital calculations, as illustrated in Fig. S4. The analysis reveals a transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), corresponding to the S0→ S1excitation. As shown, both the HOMO and LUMO of C7 and C30 display distinct π and π* characteristics, respectively, confirming a π → π* transition upon excitation to the S1state. Notably, following photoexcitation, a significant ICT occurs, with electron density shifting from the benzimidazole moiety to the benzopyranone group in the hydrogen-bonded complexes of C7 and C30.30,56This is accompanied by a pronounced redistribution of charge density, emphasizing strong ICT effects. Additionally, Mulliken charge analysis was conducted on key atoms. For instance, in the C7–MeOH complex, a comparison between the S0and S1states reveals that the charges on O1, C1, and C2shift from −0.320, 0.275, and −0.044 C in the ground state to −0.318, 0.264, and −0.091 C in the excited state, representing changes of 0.002, 0.011, and 0.047 C, respectively. These shifts further corroborate the substantial ICT behavior observed.

Molecular conformation plays a crucial role in determining the effects of hydrogen bonding on C7 and C30. In combination with ESP analysis, the geometries of C7–MeOH and C30–MeOH hydrogen-bonded complexes were examined, as illustrated inFig. 6. The key bond lengths for these hydrogen-bonded complexes obtained from the calculations are summarized inTable 7. In the C7–MeOH and C30–MeOH complexes, from the S0to S1states, the lengths of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds C1–O1⋯H1and C3–N2⋯H2both shorten. This contraction suggests a significant increase in hydrogen bond strength, promoting the ICT state. Additionally, the intramolecular hydrogen bond lengths in C7–ACN and C7–MeOH change from 2.029 and 2.046 Å in the ground state to 2.016 and 2.039 Å in the excited state, respectively, indicating a slight increase in hydrogen bond strength. As shown in Table S4, the hydrogen bond binding energies of C7 and C30 in ACN and MeOH have both increased from the S0state to the S1state, indicating that the excited state is more conducive to hydrogen bond formation and thereby favoring intramolecular charge transfer. As depicted inFig. 6, the dihedral angle N1–C3–C2–C1in C7–MeOH shifts slightly from 0.09° in the S0state to 0.11° in the S1state, while in C30–MeOH, the dihedral angle N1–C3–C2–C1decreases significantly from −46.95° in the S0state to −29.42° in the S1state, corresponding to a torsion of 17.53°. Meanwhile, according to theoretical calculations, during this dihedral torsion, the emission peak of S1state redshifts from 458 nm to 494 nm, further supporting the occurrence of the TICT process in C30, as observed in the TA spectra, indicates that C7–MeOH has undergone the TICT process.

In order to analyze in detail the influence of MeOH on the excited-state dynamics of C7 and C30, the potential energy surfaces of the two molecules were calculated using the CAM-B3LYP/Def2SVP functional and basis set combined with the SMD solvent model, As shown inFig. 7, the horizontal coordinate represents the relative dihedral angles (N1–C3–C2–C1) of the C30–MeOH hydrogen bond complex, and the vertical coordinate represents the relative energy of the hydrogen bond complex in the S1state. As shown inFig. 7, the relative energy of the C30–MeOH complex in the S1state gradually decreases by 2.88 kcal mol−1without encountering an energy barrier as the relative dihedral angle increases from 0° to 30°. In C7–MeOH, with the torsion of the relative dihedral angle, the relative energy of the S1state gradually increases up to 15.12 kcal mol−1. Through the comparison of the potential energy surfaces of these two complexes, it is further indicated that the structural characteristics of the C7–MeOH complex are conducive to the formation of stable intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the planar configuration of the benzimidazole and benzopyran parts was stabilized, effectively inhibiting the TICT process.

In conclusion, we investigated the excited-state dynamics of C7 and C30 in highly polar aprotic (ACN) and protic (MeOH) solvents using a combination of steady-state and fs-TA spectroscopy, complemented by TDDFT calculations. Our findings reveal that both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding are pivotal in the excited-state dynamics, providing novel insights into the dynamics of the TICT process. Steady-state spectral analysis demonstrated that there is a strong linear correlation between absorption, fluorescence emission and Stokes shift and solvent parameters, and these parameters have a significant impact on the observed shift. Fs-TA spectroscopy provided a detailed temporal resolution of the excited-state dynamics, distinguishing various processes such as ICT, TICT, solvation, and fluorescence emission. The structural characteristics of C7 complexes facilitate the formation of stable intramolecular hydrogen bonds in polar solvents, thereby stabilizing the planar configuration of the benzimidazole and benzopyran moieties and effectively suppressing the TICT process. In contrast, compound C30 complexes, which lack the capacity to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and are subject to steric hindrance from the methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom, exhibit greater flexibility in their dihedral angle, promoting the TICT process. Quantum chemical calculations confirmed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in C7 in both ACN and MeOH, further substantiating its structural stability. Overall, this study elucidates the photochemical and photophysical behavior of C7 and C30 in different solvent environments, providing critical insights for the molecular design of fluorescent dyes. The findings underscore the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding in controlling excited-state dynamics in polar solvents, laying an important theoretical foundation for the optimization of luminescent properties in fluorescent materials.
