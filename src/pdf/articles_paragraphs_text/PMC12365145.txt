Bromeliads provide a unique habitat for many insect species, including immature forms of mosquitoes. This study investigates the effect of abiotic factors, specifically temperature, rainfall, water volume, and physicochemical parameters, on the occurrence and abundance of mosquitoes developing in bromeliads within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Larval samples and abiotic parameters were collected from nine bromeliads between 2015 and 2017 in a forest remnant in São Paulo, Brazil. Relationships between variables were tested using generalized linear mixed-effects models and structural equation modeling (Piecewise SEM). Results indicate that rainfall and temperature influence the water volume of bromeliad tanks, which in turn affect physicochemical parameters, particularly pH. These variations affect the richness, abundance, and occurrence of mosquito species, including the vector of malaria parasites,Anopheles cruziiDyar & Knab, 1908. Piecewise SEM analysis indicated that the data were satisfactorily fitted for the models tested: species richness (Fisher’s C = 13.5,df= 12,p= 0.33, R2= 0.13), total abundance (Fisher’s C = 10,df= 8,p= 0.26, R2= 0.63), andAn. cruziipresence (Fisher’s C = 4.6,df= 8,p= 0.8, R2= 0.32). The study highlights a cascade effect where abiotic factors alter the microhabitat conditions, thereby affecting mosquito populations. Understanding these interactions is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases in tropical regions.

Abiotic factors, the non-living components of ecosystems, play a pivotal role in shaping the survival, growth, reproduction, and behavior of organisms1. Temperature and rainfall are abiotic components that significantly influence aquatic organisms, particularly those in lentic environments, such as insect larvae2,3. While temperature gradients are a primary determinant of aquatic insect assemblage structure in temperate regions4, in tropical zones, where thermal conditions vary less, rainfall can play a more influential role by altering both the availability of sites for colonization and the physicochemical factors of the habitat5,6.

In phytotelmata—water-holding plants such as bromeliads, pitcher plants, bamboo internodes and tree holes—where water availability is often intermittent and highly sensitive to rainfall, variations in precipitation can directly influence the colonization success, larval survival, and species interactions of mosquito larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) and other aquatic insects7–10. For immature forms of mosquitoes, the physicochemical conditions of water are important constraints that influence their survival, growth and adaptation11–14. Seasonal patterns or extreme weather events that alter rainfall and temperature can lead to changes in the physicochemical parameters of lentic environments where mosquitoes breed. For example, dry and warmer periods favor the loss of water by evaporation, reducing the water volume and leading to an increase of insolation and ionic concentration with changes in primary production that affect pH, salinity and dissolved oxygen5,8. While pH and salinity directly impact the ionic and osmotic regulation of mosquitoes, dissolved oxygen primarily affects the associated microfauna and flora in breeding sites15,16. Moreover, the variation in physicochemical characteristics across different phytotelm types can provide advantageous microhabitats for mosquito larvae, reflecting coevolved adaptations that enable species to thrive under specific abiotic conditions7,13,17,18.

Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) are a family of mostly neotropical plants with more than 3700 described species19. Most bromeliads are epiphytic or terrestrial, with long leaves arranged in a rosette shape that form tanks capable of retaining water and nutrients, thereby supporting the development of biotic communities17. Bromeliads can vary in tank size, leaf arrangement, exposure to sunlight and accumulation of debris, which affects water chemistry and biotic colonization20,21. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, there is a high diversity of bromeliads that harbor many species of aquatic insects, including immature forms of mosquitoes, some of which have epidemiological importance, such asAnopheles(Kerteszia)cruziiDyar & Knab, 1908, the main vector of malaria parasites in this region22–24. Many mosquito species show strong evolutionary associations with bromeliads, includingAnophelesof the subgenusKertesziaTheobald, 1905, as well as species ofMicroculexTheobald, 1907 andWyeomyiaTheobald, 190125,26. These relationships reflect specialized life history traits of these taxa to bromeliad microenvironments, such as tolerance to low levels of dissolved oxygen and acid pH, oviposition behavior, resistance to starvation, and drought-resistant eggs27–29.

Fluctuations in temperature and rainfall significantly influence the structure and dynamics of biotic communities in phytotelmata, acting as important drivers of trophic relationships, species turnover and niche diversification10,30–32. Given that changes in temperature and rainfall patterns driven by climate change are key factors that will impact the biodiversity of freshwater communities in the coming decades33,34, we hypothesize that variations in temperature and precipitation affect the volume of bromeliad water tanks, thereby promoting changes in the physicochemical parameters of the water, which in turn influence the patterns of occurrence, abundance, and richness of mosquito assemblages developing in these aquatic ecosystems.

This study had two primary objectives: first, to elucidate the ecological relationships between abiotic factors and mosquito assemblages in bromeliads, and second, to contribute to the understanding of malaria epidemiology in the Atlantic Forest by investigating the influence of these abiotic factors on the presence ofAn. cruziiin bromeliads. To achieve these goals, we conducted a study between 2015 and 2017 in a protected area of the Atlantic Forest, collecting larval samples from nine bromeliads and monitoring abiotic parameters. The data obtained demonstrates how temperature and rainfall affect the water volume within bromeliad tanks. This water volume variation, in turn, influences pH, which then, either alone or in interaction with salinity, impacted the occurrence, abundance, and richness of mosquitoes, includingAn. cruzii, in these microhabitats.

The study was performed in the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area (EPA), a remnant of Atlantic Forest situated in the southern region of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The EPA extends over the first hills near the crest of the Serra do Mar Mountain range at altitudes varying from 740 to 850 m above sea level. The climate is predominantly super-humid, oceanic, and tropical with average annual temperatures of around 19 °C and rainfall of between 1600 and 2200 mm35.

A total of ten field collections were carried out between November 2015 and April 2017 (November and December 2015; January, October, November, and December 2016; January through April 2017). Nine bromeliads from three different sites in the EPA were selected and monitored throughout the study: four bromeliads at Cachoeira (C1, C2, C3, and C4), a private property adjacent to a waterfall with a visitation area (23° 56.378′ S / 46°41. 659′ W); two bromeliads at Siloé (S1 and S2), a private property near Marsilac village located approximately 3.7 km from Cachoeira, forming a transition zone between a rural area and the EPA forest (23° 54.556′ S / 46° 42.167′ W); and three bromeliads at Borracharia (B1, B2, and B3), situated in a small village surrounded by the EPA forest (23° 54.395′ S / 46° 42.486′ W), 0.8 km from Siloé and 4.2 km from Cachoeira (see Fig.1and Supplementary Table S1). Altitudes varied from 745 m in Cachoeira to 780 m in Siloé. All the bromeliads were epiphytes (ranging from one to seven meters above the ground) and were identified asVriesiaspp. (Bromeliaceae: Tillandsioideae).

Study sites in the Capivari-Monos EPA, São Paulo, Brazil: Cachoeira, Siloé, and Borracharia. Green areas represent the remnants of the Atlantic Forest. Circles indicate collection points. The map was created using QGIS v3.34 (http://www.qgis.org).

At each collection, the water content present in each bromeliad was extracted using suction samplers and examined. The total volume of water, pH, salinity (practical salinity unit—PSU), and dissolved oxygen (parts per million—PPM) were measured for each sample using a multiparameter meter (Hanna®HI-9828). The specimens present were separated using pipettes and stored in plastic pots (200 ml) for later identification. After this, the remaining water content was returned to the bromeliad to minimize interference with its biotic community. The plastic pots containing the samples were labelled with information on the site, bromeliad number, the geographical coordinates, the date of collection, and the name of the collectors. The collected immature forms (larvae and pupae) were then placed next to each other in Styrofoam boxes to avoid excessive movement and transported to the Entomology Laboratory, School of Public Health, University of São Paulo (LESP/FSP/USP).

Upon arrival at LESP, samples from plastic bottles were transferred to labelled 300 ml white plastic containers and maintained at 25 °C with a 12 h photoperiod (06:00–18:00). Larvae were generally reared in water from their original breeding site, supplemented with dechlorinated water when necessary, and fed on existing organic matter. If food was insufficient, 0.5 g of finely crushed TretaMin®fish food was added. Once fourth-instar larvae pupated, they were isolated in 30 mL transparent plastic containers, covered to prevent adult escape. Exuviae and pupal skins were preserved for later identification. Emerging adults were euthanized in a − 20 °C freezer for 15 min, then transferred to an ethyl acetate killing tube35before dry preservation in entomological boxes for taxonomic identification. Deceased larvae were removed and preserved in 70% alcohol in labelled microtubes.

Mosquito species were identified morphologically using taxonomic keys by Lane36, Corrêa and Ramalho37, Cotrim and Galati38, and Forattini39. Most identifications relied on the morphology of adult stages, including male genitalia structures prepared according to procedures detailed in Consoli and Lourenço-de-Oliveira40. Abbreviations for genera and subgenera followed the standardization proposed by Reinert41. All identified specimens are currently stored at LESP/FSP/USP, serving as reference material for consultation.

Daily rainfall and temperature data for the study sites were obtained from the Centro de Gerenciamento de Emergências de São Paulo (CGE). For temperature, the average maximum and minimum (°C) for the 30 days prior to collection were considered. For rainfall, the accumulated rainfall (mm3) for the 30 days prior to collection was considered. The average maximum and minimum temperatures were highly correlated, so only the average maximum temperature was kept as a predictor variable, as it demonstrated a superior fit in the models.

To analyze the data, a cascade effect hypothesis was tested, in which an initial disturbance (variation in rainfall and/or temperature) affects other components in a sequence of causally connected processes1,42–44. First, the effect of accumulated rainfall and average monthly temperatures on the volume of water in the bromeliad tanks was analyzed. Next, the relationship between water volume and the variation in physicochemical parameters was analyzed. Finally, the relationship between physicochemical parameters and the occurrence, richness, and abundance of mosquitoes in the bromeliads was investigated. Direct effects of precipitation and temperature on physicochemical parameters and water volume on mosquitoes were also explored.The relationships between the variables were verified using generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) with Gaussian, binomial, or Poisson error distributions, depending on the type of response variable. The different sites and bromeliads studied were considered as random effects. To fit the best model, the backward elimination strategy was used, starting with the full model (fixed effect variables + fixed effect interactions + random effect) and eliminating the least significant fixed effect variables until the best fit was obtained. To investigate the relationship between abiotic variables and the occurrence of mosquitoes, only species that occurred five or more times during the study period were considered. Finally, we performed a path analysis using piecewise structural equation modeling (piecewise SEM)45to investigate the direct and indirect effects of the abiotic variables on species richness, total abundance, and occurrence ofAn. cruziiin bromeliads. The goodness-of-fit of piecewise SEM models was evaluated using Fisher’s C test46. The values of C can be compared to a chi-squared distribution with 2 k degrees of freedom, and values ofpabove the chosen significance threshold (α = 0.05) indicate a good fit of the model (the hypothesized relationships are consistent with the data). The R computer environment47was used to analyze the data using the packages lme448, ggplot249, sjPlot50, and piecewiseSEM45.

Throughout the study period, the accumulated rainfall for the 30 days prior to collection ranged from 61 to 429 (mm3) while the temperature for the 30 days prior to collection ranged from 21.6 to 29.5 °C for the average daily maximum and from 13.3 to 18.9ºC for the average daily minimum. The volume of water sampled per bromeliad ranged from 95 to 1050 ml. For the physicochemical parameters, pH ranged from 3.57 to 6.02, salinity from 0.006 to 0.36 PSU and dissolved oxygen from 0.2 to 8.56 ppm (see Supplementary Table S2).

A total of 535 individuals belonging to 23 taxa were collected, including specimens ofAn. cruziiand specimens of the generaCulexLinnaeus, 1758 (mostly of the subgenusMicroculexTheobald, 1907) andWyeomyiaof the subgenusPhoniomyiaTheobald, 1903. Six individuals died before reaching the adult stage (twoWyeomyia(Phoniomyia) spp. from bromeliad S1, threeCulexspp. from bromeliads B1 and B2, and oneToxorhynchitessp. Theobald, 1901 from bromeliad B2) and could not be identified at species level. The number of mosquitoes per collection ranged from 84 individuals in January 2016 to 19 individuals in April 2017 (see Supplementary Table S3). The most abundant species were those of the subgenusMicroculex, especiallyCx. pleuristriatusTheobald, 1903 with 129 individuals collected. The number of species per bromeliad ranged from 7 to 15 (bromeliads B3 and S1, respectively). No significant variations were observed in the richness and abundance of mosquitoes in relation to the height of the bromeliads above the ground (see Supplementary Table S2). In terms of occurrence, only 10 species occurred five or more times throughout the study, withCx. imitatorTheobald, 1903 andWy. davisi(Lutz, 1904) being the most frequent (29 and 19 times, respectively) and the only ones to be present in all the bromeliads investigated (Table1).

Number of individuals and occurrences per mosquito species found in nine bromeliads investigated at Capivari-Monos EPA between November 2015 and April 2017.

Regarding the best-fit models, the averages of maximum temperature and accumulated rainfall showed a significant influence on the volume of water in the bromeliads, with rainfall positively related and temperature negatively related to the water volume (Table2and Fig.2A). Rainfall was also positively related to pH, while temperature was negatively related to dissolved oxygen. The volume of water was positively related to the increase in pH (Fig.2B) and dissolved oxygen, while the increase in volume was negatively related to the abundance of mosquitoes in the bromeliads (Table2). No significant relationship was found between water volume and the occurrence probability of any mosquito species.

The intercept and slope values refer to the fixed effect parameters of the GLMMs. The standard error of the estimate is shown in brackets.

Graphs showing four models that suggest a cascade effect: (A) rainfall and temperature influence water volume in bromeliads, (B) water volume influences pH, (C) pH in interaction with salinity influences mosquito abundance, and (D) the probability ofAnopheles cruziipresence is influenced by pH. The shaded areas in A and C represent the 95% confidence interval for the estimate.

Both the richness and abundance of mosquitoes varied as a function of pH, salinity, and the interaction between these two physicochemical parameters. For lower salinities (predicted to 0.025 and 0.05 PSU), richness and abundance increased as a function of increasing pH, while for higher salinities (predicted to 0.1 PSU), richness and abundance decreased in response to increasing pH (Table2and Fig.2C). In relation to the probability of species occurrence, pH was the parameter most associated with the presence of five of the ten species tested, including the vectorAn. cruzii, which showed a positive association with pH (Table2and Fig.2D).

Piecewise SEM analysis indicated that the data were satisfactorily fitted for the three models tested: species richness (Fisher’s C = 13.5,df= 12,p= 0.33), total abundance (Fisher’s C = 10,df= 8,p= 0.26), andAn. cruziipresence (Fisher’s C = 4.6,df= 8,p= 0.8). Rainfall had direct effects on water volume, pH, and total abundance, while temperature had direct effects on water volume and total abundance. The model for total abundance showed a high explanatory power (R2= 0.63), followed byAn. cruziipresence (R2= 0.32), and species richness (R2= 0.13) (Fig.3).

Relationships between variables are indicated by arrows. The values on the arrows show the scaled estimated slope parameters.

The observed results illustrate the interaction between abiotic factors and the occurrence and abundance of mosquito larvae in bromeliads, supporting the hypothesis of a cascade effect where variations in rainfall and temperature lead to changes in the water volume of bromeliad tanks, which in turn influence physicochemical parameters and subsequently affect the richness, abundance, and occurrence of mosquitoes in these microhabitats. While rainfall increases the volume of water retained in the bromeliads, rising temperatures decrease this volume due to greater evaporation. As the volume of water in the bromeliad tanks increases, there is a tendency for pH to increase. In turn, the variation in pH influences the occurrence of certain species, including a positive relationship with the vectorAn. cruzii. and when associated with salinity it induces variations in the richness and abundance of mosquitoes in the bromeliads.

Rainfall and temperature have been shown to have diverse effects on the biotic communities of bromeliads. Previous studies have observed that changes in the hydrological regime, particularly extreme events leading to droughts or prolonged rains, affect the food web51, the relative abundance and biomass of functional groups of invertebrates52,53, and the biomass and composition of microorganisms54–56. For mosquitoes, studies conducted in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil have shown a positive relationship between rainfall, water volume in bromeliad tanks and the presence of some species, includingAn. cruziiand mosquitoes of the generaCulexandWyeomyia24,57. In a study conducted in a semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil, it was found that the probability of mosquitoes being present in bromeliads was inversely proportional to the average temperature for the 30 days prior to collection, because under high temperatures there was greater evaporation of water and the bromeliad tanks dried out more quickly58. However, bromeliads and other phytotelmata can exist in areas with specific microclimates that reduce evaporation rates, thereby decreasing larval mortality due to water loss20,21,57. Furthermore, certain mosquito species adapted to phytotelmata have evolved strategies to thrive in limited water, including producing drought-resistant eggs (e.g.,Wyeomyia aphobemaDyar, 1918 andWyeomyia lamellateBonne-Wepster & Bonne, 1919)29. Ueno59observed thatAn. cruziilarvae exhibit slow development and low mortality during periods of reduced rainfall, suggesting a survival mechanism for adverse conditions. This species also tends to show high frequency but low density per bromeliad, which may mitigate competitive stress.

As observed in this study, pH was a key factor associated with changes in the richness, abundance, and occurrence of some species. The water in the bromeliad tank tends to have low pH values and this has been associated with acids resulting from microbial activity60, leaf litter accumulated in the tanks61, accumulation of carbonic acid due to CO2 produced in respiration by microbes62, and the activity of proton pumps in the leaves as mechanisms of tank water acidification63. In a study conducted in Costa Rica, it was observed that the average pH of tank water was lower than that of rainwater for six of the eight bromeliad species investigated63. Our data corroborates these studies, indicating that the water present in bromeliad ponds tends to be acidic and that the increase in the volume of water in the ponds due to precipitation induces a reduction in the concentration of H+ions.

Interestingly, the interaction between increased pH and salinity was observed to reduce the abundance and richness of mosquitoes in bromeliads, suggesting a suboptimal environment for species that colonize this ecosystem. The mosquito species present in bromeliads seem to have some degree of predilection for more acidic environments with low salinity64. As for physiological factors, the homeostasis mechanisms that allow mosquito larvae to maintain the ionic composition and pH of the hemolymph are still poorly understood, although it is known that ions and acid–base equivalents are absorbed or excreted directly between the hemolymph and the surroundings through ion-permeable epithelia65. The anal papillae appear to function as the main organ of ion exchange, absorbing Na+, Cl−, and K+and excreting the acid–base equivalents H+, NH4+, and HCO3−66.

Mosquito species exhibit varying tolerances to salinity and pH, reflecting their diverse ecological adaptations. For example,Aedes taeniorhynchus(Wiedemann, 1821) andAn. aquasalisCurry, 1932 are well-known for thriving in coastal or brackish environments, demonstrating a broad range of salinity tolerance67,68. In a study within green areas of São Paulo city,Ae. aegypti(Linnaeus, 1762) andAe. albopictus(Skuse, 1895) were found across various artificial and natural breeding sites (including phytotelmata) under significantly varying pH conditions (4.2–9.8 and 2.3–9.8, respectively) and salinity (0.01–6.33 PSU), highlighting their broad capacity to colonize different types of breeding sites in urban areas14. Furthermore, several mosquito species inhabiting phytotelmata such as bromeliads have demonstrated remarkable adaptability to more acidic, low-conductivity environments. Notably, species from the generaWyeomyia, subgenusMicroculexofCulex, and subgenusKertesziaofAnopheleshave been documented thriving in low pH conditions, underscoring their ecological specialization14,17,64,69.

Over 200 mosquito species have been described inhabiting bromeliads in the Neotropical region, with many being bromeliad specialists17,57. Among these specialists,Kertesziamosquitoes, particularlyAn. cruzii, hold significant epidemiological importance. This species is primarily responsible for maintaining the circulation of malaria plasmodia between humans and non-human primates in the Atlantic Forest70,71. Consequently, the autochthonous malaria observed in this region is commonly known as 'Bromeliad-malaria’. In the mid-1940s, the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil were considered endemic areas for bromeliad malaria, with an annual incidence of close to 4000 cases per 100,000 inhabitants72. Once it was confirmed thatKertesziamosquitoes were the transmitters of malaria in the Atlantic Forest, various control efforts were simultaneously adopted. The measures consisted of applying larvicides and insecticides, treating patients with antimalarials, destroying bromeliads by removing them or using herbicides, and even deforesting areas close to transmission hotspots73. Currently, bromeliad malaria is hypoendemic in the region and few cases have been recorded annually. Data from the Centro de Vigilância Epidemiológica of the State of São Paulo show that between January 2017 and November 2024, 77 autochthonous cases of malaria were confirmed in the State74.

In addition toAn. cruzii, theKertesziaspeciesAn. bellatorDyar & Knab, 1906,An. homunculusKomp, 1937, andAn. neivaiHoward, Dyar & Knab, 1913 are established vectors of human and simian malaria, particularly in the Atlantic Forest and other South and Central American regions22,39,71. Furthermore,Aedesspecies (Meigen, 1818) constitute prominent vectors frequently found in bromeliads. Despite their common association with artificial containers, the dengue vectorsAe. aegyptiandAe. albopictusconsistently exploit bromeliads as breeding habitats, especially within urban and peri-urban environments75–77. However, our investigation did not detect the presence of theseAedesspecies in the studied bromeliads, implying colonization barriers in the area, potentially attributable to interspecific competition. In contrast, the genusWyeomyiaexhibited considerable richness. In the Neotropics,Wyeomyiaspecies are phytotelmata specialists, with many exclusively breeding in bromeliads. Although high densities can pose a nuisance to nearby human populations, these mosquitoes are not currently implicated in human viral disease transmission17,78.

Climate change is expected to have profound effects on freshwater communities, particularly by altering hydrological cycles, temperature regimes, and nutrient dynamics79. These environmental shifts can significantly impact mosquito populations, as changes in rainfall and temperature influence breeding site availability, larval development rates, and adult survival80. For instance, increased temperatures can accelerate the life cycle of vectors such asAe. aegyptiandCulex quinquefasciatusSay, 1823, leading to higher population densities and prolonged transmission seasons for arboviruses, including dengue, Zika, West Nile virus, and Chikungunya8. Similarly, malaria transmission, primarily driven byAnophelesmosquitoes, is also projected to shift due to climate change. Studies have shown that regions in East Africa and South America may become increasingly suitable for malaria transmission, while some highly endemic areas could experience declines due to excessive warming81. Additionally, extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, may expand mosquito habitats into previously unsuitable areas, facilitating the introduction of vector-borne diseases into new ecological and epidemiological contexts82. These complex interactions highlight the need for investigating the interplay between abiotic factors and mosquitoes’ biodiversity. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases and for developing effective strategies to mitigate the associated public health risks.

The study’s limitations primarily stem from the lack of data concerning the presence and composition of microorganisms and other invertebrate communities within the bromeliads. Incorporating such biotic information would enhance model robustness and provide more precise insights into the direct or indirect effects of abiotic factors on mosquito presence, abundance, and diversity in these microhabitats. Further limitations include the restricted sample size of investigated bromeliads, the absence of data collection during the colder, drier period from May to September, and the non-replication of the study in areas beyond the Capivari-Monos EPA. These constraints were imposed by logistical challenges encountered throughout the research. Nevertheless, we contend that the collected data are robust, accurately representing temporal variations in abiotic factors, and yielding valuable insights into their influence on the associated mosquito fauna.

This study has provided evidence of how changes in precipitation and temperature promote a cascade effect that leads to changes in the richness, abundance, and composition of mosquitoes, using the microcosm of bromeliads as a model. Given this evidence, it is necessary for future studies to seek to understand how ongoing climate change, associated with land use change and loss of biodiversity, will affect the occurrence, distribution, and abundance of mosquitoes, and the impacts of these changes on human health and ecosystems in tropical regions of the planet.
