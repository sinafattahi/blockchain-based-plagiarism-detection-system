This study aims to assess the effectiveness of coupled plasma filtration and adsorption (CPFA) in patients with SAP through its effect on inflammatory mediators and sublingual circulating blood volume. The hypothesis put to test is that CPFA can achieve a satisfactory reduction in inflammatory mediators and enhance sublingual microcirculation in SAP with a very good clinical outcome.

A cohort of 112 SAP patients admitted to the ICU of our institution between January 2018 and December 2022 was consecutively recruited. Participants were randomized to the CPFA or the control group (standard treatment) using a random number table for assignment. Posttreatment alterations in inflammatory mediators and sublingual microcirculation were analyzed and compared.

Following treatment, the study group showed significantly reduced levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 versus the control group. In addition, the study group witnessed lower serum and urinary amylase levels and APACHE II and SOFA scores. Parameters related to sublingual microcirculation, including total vessel density (TVDs), small vessel perfusion ratio (PPVs), perfusion small vessel density (PVDs), and microvascular flow index (MFIs), were significantly improved in the study group. Moreover, the study group observed lower rates of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and 30-day mortality versus the control group.

The application of CPFA in SAP patients effectively eliminates inflammatory mediators and enhances microcirculation, leading to improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality rates.

To this end, this study aims to investigate the effect of CPFA on inflammatory mediators and sublingual microcirculation in patients with SAP who were admitted to our clinic, hoping to give valuable insight into the clinical management of SAP.

This study prospectively enrolled 112 patients diagnosed with SAP who were admitted to the ICU of our institution between January 2018 and December 2022. Upon enrollment, participants were randomized to either the CPFA group or the control group, comprising 56 patients, using a random number table for assignment. All participants agreed to participate and wrote informed consent before their inclusion. Our institution’s ethics committee granted the study protocol, adhering to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Diagnosis of SAP meeting established criteria, with MOF persisting for more than 48 hours and the onset of MOF occurring within 7 days of pancreatitis symptomatology.

Presence of traumatic pancreatitis, pancreatic neoplasms, or other pancreatic disorders.

Patients presenting with septic shock at the time of admission.

Coexisting malignancies or severe cardiovascular conditions.

Significant hepatic or renal impairment, autoimmune disorders, or coagulopathy.

Other uncontrolled chronic inflammatory conditions.

All patients underwent standard management, including fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation to correct electrolyte imbalances, and early aggressive volume expansion to prevent shock. Antibiotic therapy, primarily utilizing cephalosporins, was initiated to mitigate the risk of infection. In addition, Danshen injection and hydroxyethyl starch were administered to enhance microcirculation.

The study included a control group on citrate as an anticoagulant agent while performing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration on the participants to prevent clotting in the system. The control group underwent continuous blood purification therapy utilizing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Catheter placement was conducted via venous puncture at an appropriate site in the internal jugular vein to establish vascular access. Access was achieved using the Seldinger technique through the femoral and internal jugular veins. Citrate was used for anticoagulation, with a replacement rate of 25 mL/h and a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min.

In the CPFA group, heparin, starting with a 1.0 mg/kg bolus, was given for anticoagulation. After heparin was infused, protamine was added to neutralize any effects of the heparin, following which any further adjustments necessary to achieve this successfully were duly made.

Patients in the experimental group received CPFA treatment, utilizing equipment such as the 55X blood purification machine, PN2000N plasma separator, AN69 blood filter, and HA330 blood adsorber. Upon successfully establishing vascular access, patients were administered a heparin bolus at a dosage of 1.0 mg/kg. During treatment, heparin was maintained at a rate of 15 mg/h at the blood inlet of the CPFA device, with an equivalent dose of protamine administered at the blood outlet to neutralize heparin. Heparin and protamine were discontinued 30 minutes before the conclusion of the treatment. The activated clotting time (ACT) was monitored throughout the procedure, with a target range of 180–240 seconds. The inlet blood flow rate was set to 120 mL/min, with a plasma adsorption flow rate of 25 mL/min. Blood filtration employed a pre-replacement strategy with an ultrafiltration rate of 3 mL/min. Each patient received 2 treatment sessions, spaced 3–4 days apart, each lasting 8 hours. A schematic of the CPFA protocol is depicted in Figure1.

Fasting venous blood samples were collected before treatment and 72 hours posttreatment to quantify IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, D-lactate, IL-6, and plasma diamine oxidase levels using ELISA kits. Serum amylase and urinary amylase levels were assessed through colorimetric methods. The 72 hours of observation after treatment were considered a significant time frame to observe sustained inflammatory changes, as the point when stabilization of SAP can be achieved is understood to be quite variable in this window.

Before treatment and daily posttreatment until 72 hours, patient recovery was evaluated using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and SOFA scores. The APACHE II scoring system assesses prognosis and disease severity in critically ill patients based on 12 parameters: physiological indicators, laboratory test results, and baseline health status. The total score spans from 0 to 71, where elevated scores signify a greater risk of mortality and higher rates of complications. The SOFA score evaluates the function of multiple organ systems, aiding clinicians in assessing disease severity and prognosis. It comprises 6 systems: respiratory, circulatory, hepatic, renal, coagulation, and neurological, with scores ranging from 0 to 4. The total SOFA score varies from 0 to 24, with increased scores associated with worse prognostic outcomes.

Sublingual microcirculation images were captured before treatment and 72 hours posttreatment using the LH-SDF-1 side-stream dark field imaging device. Microcirculatory metrics assessed included total density of small vessels (TVDs), perfusion small vessel density (PVDs), microvascular flow index (MFIs), and small vessel perfusion ratio (PPVs). Sublingual images were obtained by positioning the probe under the tongue after clearing oral secretions, adjusting for focus to minimize the impact of local pressure on image clarity, and capturing a 20-second video. Automated vascular analysis software was utilized to analyze the microcirculatory images and extract the specified parameters.

All patients were followed for 30 days post-intervention to record the incidence of severe adverse events, including necrotizing pancreatitis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and mortality.

Data were processed utilizing SPSS version 22.0. Graphical illustrations were generated through R software and GraphPad Prism. Continuous variables are expressed as mean±SD and analyzed with the Studentttest, whereas categorical variables are represented as proportions and examined using χ2tests. The significance threshold was established at α=0.05, and all tests were 2-tailed.

The clinical characteristics and demographic profiles of patients in both groups were assessed and compared, encompassing age, sex, duration from symptom onset to hospital admission, baseline APACHE II scores, and the underlying etiology of pancreatitis. Although the general characteristics were reasonably balanced across groups, males tended to dominate in the control group (39 males vs. 31 males in the CPFA group). Since SAP severity may differ according to sex, this could affect the interpretation of results (Table1).

The inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10, were measured pretreatment and posttreatment in each group. Before treatment, the values of these parameters were insignificantly different in the groups (allP>0.05). In addition, even plasma lactate levels were shown to have statistically significant differences between the CPFA and control groups after treatment (P<0.05). Plasma diamine oxidase levels decreased more in the CPFA group, suggesting better intestinal barrier function (Fig.2).

Comparison of inflammatory mediators: This figure compares key inflammatory mediators (ie, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-10) pretreatment versus posttreatment in both groups. Counting these and performing microvascular function tests will require specialized equipment and experience. ***P<0.001.

Changes in serum and urinary amylase levels were analyzed before and after treatment in both groups. Before treatment, the difference in serum and urinary amylase levels was insignificant in the 2 groups (allP>0.05). Although amylase levels in serum and urine are recognized as markers of pancreatic injury, their prognostic value in SAP is limited. It must, therefore, be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical scoring systems and other biomarkers¹ (Table2).

APACHE II and SOFA scores were utilized to assess clinical severity before and after treatment in both groups. Before treatment, these 2 parameters’ scores were matched in groups (allP>0.05). Notably, both indices’ scores were reduced in both groups, with lower scores in the study group (allP<0.05) (Table3).

Posttreatment assessments of sublingual microcirculation parameters—including TVDs, PVDs, PPVs, and MFIs—were compared between the groups. All parameters indicative of sublingual microcirculation (TVDs, PVDs, PPVs, MFIs) exhibited higher values in the study group (allP<0.05, Table4).

All patients were followed for a duration of 30 days post-intervention to evaluate the occurrence of serious adverse events, including necrotizing pancreatitis, SIRS, and mortality. The incidence of necrotizing pancreatitis was similar in both groups; however, SIRS and mortality rates were significantly lower in the study group (allP<0.05) (Table5). Specifically, the incidence of necrotizing pancreatitis was 8.93% (5/56) in the control and 1.79% (1/56) in the study group, thus indicating a marked area reduction of this complication in the CPFA group (Table6). Similarly, SIRS was seen in 21.43% (12/56) of patients in the control group versus 7.14% (4/56) in the study group and mortality in 14.29% (8/56) of cases (Table6).

The leading cause of death in the control group was septic shock and multiple organ failure. However, a significantly lower mortality rate from these causes was often observed in the CPFA group, suggesting a protective role of CPFA for improved systemic outcomes. Study patients had shorter ICU stays than controls, returned to normal function faster, and combined, thus indicating possible influence over long-term recovery outcomes.

SAP is characterized by an abrupt onset and rapid progression, often leading to high mortality rates due to complications such as multiple organ failure.15Activating circulating monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes by trypsin results in the release of various inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β, and IL-6. The excessive and prolonged release of these mediators can lead to widespread effects, causing endothelial dysfunction and organ impairment, potentially progressing to SIRS and MODS.16Thus, in this study, improved microcirculation noted in the CPFA group seems to be associated with reduced systemic complications, such as lower mortality rates, indicating a favorable impact on severe SAP outcomes.

Panda et al30demonstrated that microcirculatory disturbances contribute to the progression of septic shock. Their research showed that changes in sublingual microcirculatory perfusion in septic shock patients are associated with lactate clearance within 6 hours.31This study confirms that CPFA can enhance sublingual microcirculation in SAP patients, contributing to improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality; however, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects warrant further investigation.

This study elucidated the efficacy of CPFA in the treatment of SAP. By enhancing sublingual microcirculation in SAP patients, CPFA facilitates improved local blood flow and nutrient delivery, which is essential for mitigating tissue injury and accelerating recovery. Furthermore, CPFA effectively removes inflammatory mediators that play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of SAP. By attenuating inflammatory levels, CPFA minimizes further damage to surrounding tissues and alleviates systemic inflammatory responses. Moreover, the findings indicate that CPFA treatment may significantly lower mortality rates in SAP patients, which carries important implications for enhancing patient quality of life and overall prognosis. Long-term benefits of CPFA in this study included shorter ICU stays and improved rate of return to baseline functional status, which indicates an interesting promise of CPFA for recovery pathway optimization. However, despite these significant findings, certain methodological limitations may affect the comprehensiveness and precision of the results. The relatively small sample size presents a risk of bias and uncertainty in the outcomes. To accurately evaluate the therapeutic effects of CPFA, larger-scale clinical trials are warranted for validation. The duration of follow-up in this study may be inadequate for thoroughly assessing the long-term effects of CPFA. Extended monitoring and follow-up are crucial for SAP patients to determine the persistence of improvements and the potential risk of recurrence. While this study validated the beneficial effects of CPFA in SAP, it did not investigate the underlying mechanisms in detail. A more nuanced understanding of CPFA’s mechanisms of action requires further biological and molecular research.

Implementing CPFA treatment in patients with SAP effectively clears inflammatory mediators and improves microcirculation, enhancing therapeutic outcomes and decreasing mortality rates.
