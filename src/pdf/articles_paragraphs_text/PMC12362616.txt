To evaluate the benefits and harms of removable and fixed prostheses for people with edentulous mandibles.

To explore whether equity impacts the benefits and harms of removable and fixed prostheses for people with edentulous mandibles, particularly in relation to the age and economic status of wearers.

Edentulism is the complete absence of teeth, usually as a result of extraction following caries, periodontal disease or trauma [1]. It has been described as the “ultimate marker of disease burden for oral health” [2]. People can be edentulous in the upper jaw (maxilla), lower jaw (mandible) or both. There are inequities across populations affected by edentulism. The prevalence of edentulism ranges from 1% to 70% in different countries, with a pooled global prevalence of 22%. This differs in different parts of the world: halved in North America and nearly doubled in South America [3]. Regardless of country, an association has been found between edentulism and high‐poverty rural areas [4]. Research has also shown that low socioeconomic groups consistently show an approximately 10% higher prevalence of edentulism than higher socioeconomic groups [2], and difficulty with chewing relating to edentulism is clustered in low socioeconomic groups [5,6]. In addition, the prevalence of edentulism increases with age, impacting approximately a third of people aged over 75 years in the UK [7], and edentulism has been shown to be a predictor of cognitive decline [8]. As women have a higher life expectancy than men [9], there are naturally more females than males who are edentulous.

Edentulism can be left untreated, although this is generally associated with a lower quality of life as it impacts on appearance, well‐being, and ability to chew and speak effectively. In many parts of the world, there is a social norm that missing visible teeth are replaced. Treatment for edentulism is commonly provided by conventional complete dentures (also called ‘false teeth’ or ‘full dentures’); these prostheses are removable.

People can become edentulous at any age. It is thought that younger people have greater ability to adapt to a new dental prosthesis, but this is a product of superior oral musculatory ability rather than age per se [10]. Indeed, this trend may be reversed in experienced denture‐wearers who may have had years or decades of adaptation and are more able to wear even technically substandard prostheses [11]. In short, it is difficult to predict whether a person will be able to adapt successfully to complete dentures [12]. Age of the wearer is also relevant because the edentulous mandible atrophies/resorbs over time [13], making effective prosthesis construction and wear more challenging.

In general, people struggle more with being edentulous in the mandible than the maxilla due to the horseshoe‐shaped anatomy of the mandible [14,15], and the presence of the mobile tongue and muscle attachments, which compromise the retention of conventional complete dentures. This can compromise the wearer's comfort [16], as well as the ability to eat or chew food, speech, and appearance, leading to a decline in quality of life.

As an alternative to conventional removable complete dentures, people may be given dental implants. These can provide a removable (implant‐retained denture or overdenture) or fixed (implant‐supported bridge, or full‐arch bridge) solution to address the difficulties with conventional dentures.

When deciding which mandibular intervention to provide, the status of the opposing jaw is highly relevant. People with edentulous mandibles who have natural teeth in the opposing maxillary arch may suffer accelerated bone atrophy due to increased occlusal loading [17], and difficulty in achieving a satisfactory occlusal arrangement with conventional complete prostheses [18]. There are considerations to be made when selecting fixed or removable mandibular implant‐supported prostheses related to the status of the opposing jaw [19].

Studies have shown that quality of life is severely impacted by tooth loss, an inability to chew food, or oral discomfort as a result of a poorly fitting prosthesis [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]; these impacts are especially felt by older people [28]. Edentulism and prosthesis use also impact on food choices [29], with people who are edentulous eating fewer fruits and vegetables [30], and those with unsatisfactory prostheses generally avoiding more foods and having a diet of lower nutritional value [31,32]. Problems with chewing in this population are linked to depression [33], as well as social embarrassment and difficulties in intimate relationships [34,35].

It is recognised that these negative impacts can be reversed with the insertion of one or more dental implants in the mandible, to retain either a removable or fixed prosthesis [36,37,38,39,40,41]. In addition, there is limited evidence that implant‐retained prostheses improve cognitive function in this cohort [42]. Although there is uncertainty about the optimal number of implants, types of attachments, and whether the prosthesis should be fixed or removable, there is international consensus that a two‐implant overdenture should be the first line of treatment in the management of mandibular edentulism [43]. However, this is not the case globally, primarily due to limited resources [44], but also because there are many people who either do not want dental implants [45], or believe a fixed dental implant‐supported prosthesis to be superior [46].

Although there are published systematic reviews on interventions for edentulism, there is no comprehensive and methodologically robust review to evaluate which type of prosthesis is the most effective at improving the wearer's comfort, ability to chew or maintain the prosthesis, and other important quality of life criteria. In this review, we seek to establish the effectiveness of different prostheses, particularly from the wearer's perspective, in the short (up to one year), medium (up to five years), and long term (more than five years). Length of follow‐up is particularly important given the risk of cognitive decline in this population group [47]. Cost is also an important consideration, particularly for clinical decision‐making and commissioning of services, and likely explains the variation in prosthesis use globally. Therefore, we will seek to collect information about cost to provide additional context to this review.

To evaluate the benefits and harms of removable and fixed prostheses for people with edentulous mandibles.

To explore whether equity impacts the benefits and harms of removable and fixed prostheses for people with edentulous mandibles, particularly in relation to the age and economic status of wearers.

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the review [48], and PRISMA 2020 for the reporting [49].

We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating prostheses for the rehabilitation of edentulous mandibles. Although less likely, it is also feasible to conduct cluster‐RCTs for this topic, and we will include these types of studies if they have at least two groups and otherwise meet the eligibility criteria.

Because of the nature of the intervention, cross‐over designs and split‐mouth studies are inappropriate, and we will exclude these study designs. We will also exclude quasi‐randomised trials (in which participants are allocated to groups using a non‐random method, such as date of birth).

We will not limit our study inclusion by year of dissemination or language of publication. We will include unpublished manuscripts and conference abstracts if these report sufficient information to meet the inclusion criteria for this review.

We will include people who are edentulous (i.e. have no teeth at all) in the mandible regardless of age, reason for tooth loss, and length of time since becoming edentulous. We will also include people who require all teeth to be removed from their mandible – i.e. who are not edentulous at the time of recruitment but will have an edentulous mandible when allocated to the intervention or comparison.

We will include people regardless of the restorative status of the opposing jaw (edentulous, partially dentate, full natural teeth, or with implant‐based interventions).

We will only include studies of mixed populations (i.e. dentate, partially dentate, edentulous) if it is possible to obtain data specifically for people who are edentulous in the mandible. If necessary, we will contact study authors to request these separate data.

We will include studies evaluating any of two different treatment options for edentulous mandibles.

Treatment with implant‐retained removable dentures secured by one or more dental implants, regardless of the type of implant and attachment used to retain the prosthesis.

Treatment with implant‐supported fixed (non‐removable) full‐arch bridges regardless of the number of dental implants used.

We will include studies that compare these treatments with conventional removable complete dentures (in which no implants are used to retain prostheses in place). We will also include studies that compare the two treatment options with one another (implant‐retained removable dentures with implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges).

Therefore, we will include the following comparisons in this review.

Comparison 1: implant‐retained removable dentures versus conventional removable complete dentures.

Comparison 2: implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges versus conventional removable complete dentures.

Comparison 3. implant‐retained removable dentures versus implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges.

We will include interventions delivered in any setting, including academic institutions, hospitals and primary care services.

We are not aware of any core outcome sets for this topic. In this review, we consider participant‐reported outcomes (from the perspective of the people who wear dental prostheses) to be most important. We will report data for participant‐reported outcomes regardless of whether these data are collected using standardised generic or disease‐specific and validated measurement instruments or simple questions designed for the individual study. If studies use summated scales to report participant‐reported outcomes (e.g. the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) for this population, OHIP‐EDENT [50]), we will attempt to extract the results of any domain‐specific scores (e.g. satisfaction or comfort) as well as overall scores, in order to provide consumers of this review (i.e. people who require prostheses for the edentulous mandible) with information relevant to their own individual concerns.

We are also interested in nutrition‐related outcomes as poor nutrition caused by dentures or surgical complications may lead to other important health conditions, as well as complications related to the prostheses and implants (for implant‐retained and implant‐supported prostheses).

Given the resource implications of different treatment options, particularly for policy decision‐making, we are also interested in evidence related to cost.

We have selected outcomes and prioritised them in order of critical and other important outcomes in consultation with a small number of consumers (seeConsumer involvement).

Chewing ability.We will prioritise participant‐reported measures, using any instrument and scale. However, we will also report the results of objective assessments, such as chewing tests.

Appearance; measured using any instrument (and scale) to determine whether the participant is happy with the appearance of their prosthesis.

Speech.We will prioritise participant‐reported measures, using any instrument and scale. However, we will also report the results of any formal assessments such as those completed by a Speech and Language Therapist.

Satisfaction; measured using any instrument (and scale) to determine if the participant is satisfied with their prosthesis. For this outcome, we will capture general satisfaction (or satisfaction that is not defined by study authors). For example, if study authors report data described as 'satisfaction with appearance', we will include these data as a measure of 'appearance' rather than 'satisfaction'.

Comfort; measured using any instrument (and scale) to determine whether the participant considers their prosthesis to be comfortable.

Oral health‐related quality of life (OHRQoL). We will prioritise measurements using a validated instrument designed to capture OHRQoL in people who are edentulous, such as OHIP‐EDENT [50]. Otherwise, we will use other validated measurement instruments, such as OHIP‐49 [51] and the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) [52]. We will include responses to unvalidated questionnaires only if data from validated instruments are not available in the study report. For this outcome, we will report overall (summated) scores.

Adverse effects.For our critical outcomes, we will report the number of participants that are unable to use prostheses owing to any prosthesis‐ or implant‐related adverse effect(s).

Diet or nutrition. We will report all appropriate measurements of this outcome, such as change in biochemical markers or body mass index (BMI), or subjective measures (such as those using food diaries, 24‐hour recall, or food frequency questionnaires).

General health‐related quality of life. We will include measurements from validated instruments such as the Euroqol‐5 Dimensions survey (EQ‐5D [53]) and the 36‐item Short Form Survey (SF‐36 [54]), and we will report the overall scores from these instruments.

Maintainability; measured using any instrument (and scale) to determine whether the participant considers that they are able to adequately maintain their prosthesis, for example with appropriate cleaning.

Prosthetic complications(such as prosthesis or prosthetic tooth fracture, prosthesis‐induced oromucosal conditions, prosthesis‐induced ridge resorption). For this outcome, we will report data separately for each type of complication per participant. We will also note whether participants switched to the alternative intervention and the reasons for this cross‐over.

Implant‐related complications(such as implant loss, implant removal, implant fracture, infection). For this outcome, we will report data separately for each type of complication and for peri‐ or post‐implant placement complications per participant. We will also note whether participants switched to the alternative intervention and the reasons for this cross‐over.

We will also collect information on costs from eligible studies. We will use this information to prepare a brief economic commentary, providing an economic context to the review findings (see methods for 'Incorporating economic evidence' at the end of this protocol).

For all outcomes, we will group outcomes into four distinct time points, as follows.

Immediate: one year or less since delivery of prostheses.

Short term: more than one to five years since delivery of prostheses.

Medium‐term: more than five to 10 years since delivery of prostheses.

Long‐term: more than 10 years since delivery of prostheses.

In the event that studies report more than one time point within these thresholds, we will aim to use the latest available time point. However, we will also consider whether it is more appropriate to use the time point that is most frequently reported between studies.

We will include studies regardless of whether they report outcomes of interest for this review.

Using tailored search strategies, we will search the following electronic databases for relevant trials.

There will be no limitations based on language or publication type. In MEDLINE, we will combine subject‐specific terms with the sensitivity‐maximising version of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials [55]. We will adapt the search strategy for MEDLINE for use in the other listed electronic databases (Supplementary material 1). This strategy was initially developed by an Information Specialist (formerly of Cochrane Oral Health) for a previous version of a protocol for this review [56], and modified with additional search terms by the current author team.

We will also search the following trials registries, with no limitations based on language or date.

The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (trialsearch.who.int/).

US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/).

To identify additional eligible studies not otherwise retrieved from searches of electronic databases, we will examine the reference lists of eligible studies. We will also examine reference lists of any systematic reviews on similar topics; we will use systematic reviews that we identify from the searches of electronic databases.

For any eligible studies, we will search in the relevant journals for any postpublication amendments (such as expressions of concern, errata, corrigenda and retractions). We will also check if any eligible studies have been retracted due to error or other problematic reasons using Retraction Watch (retractionwatch.com/).

We will record the results of searches, including a flow diagram to summarise the decision‐making process, and we will provide a brief reason for excluding full‐text articles. For studies that are ineligible for more than one reason, we will use a hierarchy of reasons to exclude as follows: ineligible type of study, ineligible type of participants, or ineligible intervention.

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, will extract study characteristics and quantitative data from each included study using a data extraction form in Covidence [57], which we will initially pilot on a small sample of studies (10% of the included studies). We will contact study authors by email for clarification or missing data where necessary and feasible. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion, consulting a third review author to achieve consensus when necessary.

We will record the following information for each included study.

Participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria, country of study, number of centres and type of setting (primary or secondary care, or academic institution, rural or urban location), number randomised to groups, number of losses and number analysed, any deviations from protocol (such as switching to an alternative intervention), baseline characteristics of participants in each group (number of previous prostheses (fixed/removable) and years edentulous, restorative status of opposing jaw, anatomical classification of edentulous ridge, any other relevant dental history, age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status (SES), and any other PROGRESS‐Plus characteristics (these characteristics relate to place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, SES, social capital, personal characteristics associated with disability, features of relationships, and time‐dependent relationships) [58]).

Interventions: details of treatments (type of prosthesis, number of implants and type of implants (osseointegrated, biocompatible to create a strong direct connection with surrounding bones; or other types), type of attachment for people with implant‐retained removable prostheses).

Outcomes: review outcomes (to include measurement tool and time point of measurement), quantitative outcome data for outcomes listed inCritical outcomesandImportant outcomes(e.g. number of events or mean scores per group, and total number analysed per group), description of other outcomes reported by study authors.

If translation is required for data extraction, we will first use Google Translate before seeking additional support from a native speaker. If necessary, we will seek a full translation of the study report.

Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, will assess the risk of bias in the included studies using RoB 2 [60]; we will also be guided by Chapter 8 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[61]. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion, consulting a third review author to achieve consensus when necessary.

In the event that we identify any cluster‐RCTs, we will use the most up‐to‐date modified RoB 2 tools for this RCT design (www.riskofbias.info/welcome/rob‐2‐0‐tool).

We will prioritise risk of bias assessment for the study results of the critical outcomes in this review measured at short‐term follow‐up.

We are interested in quantifying the effect of assignment to the intervention at baseline, regardless of whether the interventions were received as intended (the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) effect). To implement RoB 2, we will use the RoB 2 Excel tool (available at www.riskofbias.info/welcome/rob‐2‐0‐tool/current‐version‐of‐rob‐2). For each domain, we will use the signalling questions provided by the RoB 2 tool, answering 'yes', 'probably yes', 'probably no', ‘no’, or 'no information'.

We will use this process to reach a risk of bias judgement for each result of low risk of bias, some concerns or high risk of bias. Generally, the overall risk of bias score for a result is based on the least favourable assessment made for any of the domains. However, if 'some concerns' arise in multiple domains, we will assign an overall high risk of bias judgement for that result. The RoB 2 tool automatically generates a judgement regarding bias for each domain and overall bias. However, we will check these automatically‐generated judgements and amend them if necessary [62].

For dichotomous data, we will express the effect estimate as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, for which studies report data using the same measurement tool and scale, we will express the effect estimate as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. In the event that studies report data using different scales, we will report the standardised mean difference (SMD) and its associated 95% CI. However, in this case, we will also re‐express this data as an MD of the most commonly used scale in the meta‐analysis (ideally, this will also be the scale most familiar to users of the review); we will be guided by Section 15.5.3.2 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[63].

We anticipate that the individual participant will be the unit of analysis for this review. If studies include more than two study groups, we will meta‐analyse data using approaches that avoid double‐counting of participants (Chapter 23 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[64]). If intervention (or control) groups are sufficiently similar (i.e. in the same main comparison group), we will combine study groups to create a single pair‐wise comparison. Alternatively, for continuous data, we will split the ‘shared’ group into two or more groups with smaller sample sizes, and include two or more independent comparisons in the meta‐analysis.

In the event that cluster‐RCTs are included, we will use the cluster (e.g. dental hospital) as the unit of allocation, and we will avoid using analysis that assumes that the unit of allocation is at the participant level. If studies report data that they have adjusted to account for the clustering effect, we will use these adjusted data in the review. Otherwise, we will calculate effective sample sizes for each study group using guidance in Chapter 23 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[64].

We will pay attention to data for outcomes that may include additional counting of a participant (e.g. a person may have more than one type of prosthetic complication) and will ensure that participants for these outcomes are only counted once for each outcome measure.

We will contact study authors of the included studies where methodology or other information is unclear or missing; we will distinguish between published data and data sourced by personal communication in the review. If we are unable to source additional outcome data for missing participants, we will include only the available data in the meta‐analysis. If data are missing for continuous data (e.g. missing SDs), we will use the methods described in Section 6.5.2 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[65].

We will seek prospective clinical trials registration or a prespecified analysis plan or protocol for all included studies and use this information in order to assess bias in the selection of the reported result. We will also assess whether studies have selectively reported findings of a particular outcome measurement or a particular analysis. We will evaluate this information during the risk of bias assessment (Risk of bias assessment in included studies).

We will generate a funnel plot for meta‐analyses including more than 10 studies (of different sample sizes), as a means of displaying small‐study effects [62]. If we note asymmetry from visual inspection of the funnel plot, we will carry out tests, using Egger 1997 for continuous outcomes [66], and Rűcker 2008 for dichotomous outcomes [67]. Although asymmetry may indicate the risk of publication bias (possible non‐reporting of studies), we note that there are other possible reasons for asymmetry in funnel plots [62].

We will conduct meta‐analysis of studies that have sufficiently similar participants, interventions, comparisons and outcome measures to be clinically meaningful. We will pool studies regardless of our overall risk of bias judgements.

We will include studies in analyses, based on information collected during data extraction, for the following comparisons.

Implant‐retained removable complete dentures versus conventional removable complete dentures.

Implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges versus conventional removable complete dentures.

Implant‐retained removable complete dentures versus implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges.

Using Review Manager (RevMan) [68], we will combine data from more than one study using random‐effects models in order to allow for any clinical and methodological variation between study populations, and to estimate the mean of the distribution of effects.

We will use the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate the between‐study variance [69], unless there are issues with estimation, in which case we will use the DerSimonian and Laird method [70], according to Cochrane guidance (training.cochrane.org/resource/introduction‐to‐new‐random‐effects‐methods‐in‐revman). We will use the level of observed heterogeneity and the number of studies in the meta‐analyses to choose between Hartung‐Knapp‐Sidik‐Jonkman (HKSJ) or Wald‐type approaches to calculate CIs for the summary effect [65]. Specifically, when the between‐study variance estimate is greater than zero and the number of study results is greater than two, we will use the HKSJ method for the summary effect rather than the Wald‐type method, as outlined in Section 10.10.4 in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[71]. This reduces the risk of producing overly narrow CIs (when the estimated between‐study variance is zero), or overly wide CIs (when the number of studies is two). In the event that RCTs report data as effect estimates and 95% CIs (without numerical data per group), we will add these data to meta‐analyses using the generic inverse variance (GIV) method. For cluster‐RCTs, we aim to use adjusted data as reported by study authors, which we will add to meta‐analyses using GIV; otherwise we will adjust data using the methods described in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions(seeUnit of analysis issues) [64]. We will present the quantitative results of any analyses in forest plots, and we will summarise the results in the review report.

If a study reports outcome data with zero events in either group, we will include these data in meta‐analyses but interpret the results with caution according to Chapter 10.4.4.1 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[71]. If a study reports more than one measurement instrument for the same outcome (e.g. both SF‐36 and EQ‐5D to report quality of life), we will use data in meta‐analysis from the instrument that is most commonly used across included studies.

We will assess statistical heterogeneity in the results of meta‐analyses by visual inspection of the individual study point estimates and CIs in forest plots; lack of overlap of CIs may indicate heterogeneity. We will formally assess statistical heterogeneity using Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I2statistic. For interpretation of the amount of statistical heterogeneity, we will use the thresholds outlined in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[71].

In the event that data are not amenable to meta‐analysis, we will synthesise the results of studies according to the 'Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis (SWiM)' guideline [72].

If sufficient data are available, we will use formal tests for subgroup interactions to evaluate if there are differences in the results of meta‐analyses according to the following population characteristics.

The number of years that people have been edentulous, comparing the following four subgroups: dentate at the time of recruitment but then rendered edentulous and fitted with a prosthesis at time of allocation; edentulous ≤ 10 years; edentulous 11 to 20 years; or edentulous > 20 years.

Restorative status of the opposing jaw, comparing the following three subgroups: presence of complete prosthesis in the maxilla; partial prostheses in the maxilla; or dentate maxilla. If people have prostheses in the maxilla, we are also interested in whether these are conventional complete dentures, implant‐retained removable dentures or implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges.

Anatomical classification of the edentulous ridge, comparing the following three subgroups: atrophic/severely resorbed; resorbed; or normal ridges. We will include classifications according to Atwood [73] and Cawood and Howell [74], or other classifications specified by study authors.

For implant‐retained removable complete dentures, we will also explore intervention characteristics in relation to the implants and the attachment types, as follows.

Type of attachment: ball; locator; bar; magnet; or other (not specified).

We will conduct subgroup analysis on study‐level variables (i.e. each study will only be included in one subgroup). However, if a study includes mixed characteristics (e.g. inclusion of participants with different edentulous experience at enrolment), and separate data are available for participants in these groups, we will include subsets of participants in each subgroup as within‐study contrasts (Chapter 10,Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[71]). We will calculate formal statistical tests for subgroup interactions using RevMan [68].

We will collect participant characteristics according to PROGRESS‐Plus [58], as described underData extraction and management. We will report these in tables of study characteristics.

For this topic, participant age is a relevant characteristic. We will complete additional subgroup analyses using the same approach described above (seeInvestigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis) for the following age categories.

Commonly edentulous population: 65 to < 85 years of age.

Older adult edentulous population: ≥ 85 years of age.

There are also relevant differences in participants' access to treatment options according to SES. We will conduct additional subgroup analyses to group data according to lower and higher economic status. However, we anticipate that studies will report different PROGRESS‐Plus characteristics for participants, and we will take a more pragmatic approach to defining subgroups of economic status. Therefore, we will assess study‐level information to determine economic status based on SES and education characteristics of participants, and the study setting characteristics (the country and other regional or local characteristics such as whether the study was conducted in urban or rural settings).

We will evaluate the robustness of meta‐analysis on decisions taken during the review process as follows.

We will exclude studies that we judged to have an overall high risk of bias.

We will only include studies that we judged to have an overall low risk of bias.

We will exclude studies for which we have imputed missing SDs, or (in the case of cluster‐RCTs) we have calculated effective sample sizes based on an assumed intracorrelation coefficient.

We will compare the results of sensitivity analyses with the primary analysis. We will report any effect estimates that indicate a different interpretation of the effect (e.g. that differ from the primary analysis in size or direction of effect) based on informal comparisons.

We will use the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the body of evidence associated with the critical outcomes measured at the immediate follow‐up of up to 12 months [75].

The GRADE approach assesses the certainty of a body of evidence based on the extent to which we can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the item being assessed. Evaluation of the certainty of a body of evidence considers risk of bias, directness of the evidence (indirectness), heterogeneity of the data (inconsistency), precision of the effect estimates (imprecision), and risk of publication bias; we will base the risk of bias evaluation on our judgements of the overall risk of bias in studies (seeRisk of bias assessment in included studies). The certainty of the evidence could be high, moderate, low or very low, being downgraded by one or two levels depending on the presence and extent of concerns in each of the five GRADE domains. We will use the following interpretation for each level of certainty.

High‐certainty evidence: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.

Moderate‐certainty evidence: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effects, but there is the possibility that it is substantially different.

Low‐certainty evidence: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Very low‐certainty evidence: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Two review authors will assess the certainty of the evidence independently and reach consensus through discussion, consulting a third author in the event of any disagreement.

We will construct summary of findings tables for the following comparisons.

Implant‐retained removable dentures versus conventional removable dentures.

Implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges versus conventional removable dentures.

Implant‐retained removable dentures versus implant‐supported fixed full‐arch bridges.

We will use GRADE profiler software to construct these tables [76].

It is important for us to listen to people who have experience of wearing dentures to replace missing teeth. This allows us to make sure our research is relevant to the right people. Involving people with lived experience will improve the quality of our research, and will improve how our findings are shared with the right people.

When developing this protocol, we spoke to relevant consumers (people who have experience of wearing dentures to replace missing teeth). One review author (SJ) approached consumers attending the dental clinic in which the review author works and asked if they were willing to provide some informal input into our review. SJ discussed the critical and important outcomes for this topic and time points of interest with the consumers, and we agreed a priority order of outcomes for this review based on the consumer input. We also used the results of this discussion to agree which were the seven most important outcomes and the time point that is most relevant to consumers to summarise in a table of results (Summary of findings table).

We will involve consumers in the interpretation of the evidence and the presentation of the results. In particular, we will engage with consumers in preparation of the plain language summary. We will engage with consumers from dental clinics in which the review authors work.

We will develop a brief economic commentary to summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations that compare the eligible interventions in this review. This commentary will focus on the extent to which principal findings of eligible economic evaluations indicate that an intervention might be judged favourably (or unfavourably) from an economic perspective, when implemented in different settings. We will follow current methods guidelines (methods.cochrane.org/economics/), as well as Chapter 20 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[77].

We will include cost‐effectiveness studies (cost‐effectiveness analyses, cost‐utility analyses, cost‐benefit analyses) evaluating any of the interventions and comparisons in this review: conventional removable prostheses, implant‐retained removable prostheses, or implant‐supported fixed prostheses. We will not limit eligibility by date of publication.

To prepare a brief economic commentary to support this review, we will run additional searches for relevant economic studies in the following databases.

NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (inception to 31 March 2015); this database is no longer updated, so our searches will only retrieve studies up to 2015.

We will adapt the main search strategies. For MEDLINE and Embase, we will use the same terms for the edentulous mandible and prostheses, and we will combine these terms (using AND) with a search filter for economic studies developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network [78] (Supplementary material 1); for NHS EED, we will use only terms for edentulous mandible and prostheses.

One review author (DB) will extract basic details of the characteristics of each identified economic evaluation, and brief text extracts that summarise their principal findings.

We will not subject any identified economic evaluation to critical appraisal, and we will not attempt to draw any firm or general conclusions regarding the relative costs or efficiency of one type of prosthesis compared with another.

In the Discussion section of the completed review, we will provide a brief narrative summary to include the results of the search, the number of eligible economic evaluations identified for the comparisons in this review, descriptive information extracted from each study, principal conclusions as reported by the authors of each analysis, and the main sources of uncertainty regarding study authors’ principal conclusions.
