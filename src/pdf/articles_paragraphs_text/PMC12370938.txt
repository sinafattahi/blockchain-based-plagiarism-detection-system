Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are major global health threats. This study explores links between anti-allergic drugs and CVD risk, providing valuable insights for clinical pharmacotherapy. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed on 139 eQTLs for anti-allergic drugs in coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and atrial fibrillation (AF) cohorts, with validation in independent cohorts. Sensitivity analyses, transcriptomics analysis, enrichment analysis, and molecular docking were performed to evaluate the robustness of causality, potential pathways and binding affinity. Furthermore, the FAERS database evaluated the cardiovascular adverse events associated with prednisone in combination with cardiovascular drugs. Among the 11 anti-allergic drug targets significantly linked to CVDs, KAT2A inversely correlated with CAD risk, BAZ2B and CYP2C8 with AF risk, and ITGB2, TG and six other eQTLs were associated with HF risk. Notably, prednisone (targeting ITGB2, TG) and loratadine (targeting TSHR) elevated CVD risk, while zafirlukast (targeting KAT2A, POLB, BAZ2B) reduced it. The progression of CVDs may be influenced by the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and lipid accumulation, which could potentially be affected by the administration of prednisone and similar medications. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between the cardiovascular candidate drug quercetin and zafirlukast (POLB). Pharmacovigilance analysis indicated an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes with the concurrent use of prednisone and cardiovascular drugs. The comprehensive analyses indicate that certain anti-allergic drugs may heighten the risk of CVDs, suggesting caution with medications like prednisone.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a significant global health challenge, severely impacting human quality of life and life expectancy. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence and prevalence of CVDs are continually rising, establishing them as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The spectrum of CVDs is diverse, with the most common types including coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and myocardial infarction (MI). According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), the prevalence of CVDs worldwide has surged to 523 million, with fatalities reaching 18.6 million1. The 2001 GBD estimates indicated that 43% of CVD-related mortalities were attributable to CAD, claiming nearly 7 million lives annually2. Furthermore, data from the 2019 GBD reveal that the global incidence of HF has exceeded 50 million cases3. Between 2011 and 2015, low-to middle-income countries faced a staggering economic burden of approximately $3.7 trillion due to CVDs. It is therefore necessary to control modifiable risk factors for CVDs.

The cardiovascular effects of anti-allergic medications have been a longstanding subject of medical research, but current scientific evidence remains inconclusive. These medications exhibit a dual nature regarding cardiovascular health, presenting both potential benefits and risks. Numerous studies suggest that anti-allergic medications could influence cardiac function and vascular reactivity through diverse mechanisms4–7. Specifically, corticosteroids such as prednisone may increase vascular responsiveness to other active substances, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure, potentially placing strain on the cardiovascular system. In contrast, other classes of anti-allergic drugs, such as leukotriene receptor antagonists, are generally considered to have minimal impact on cardiac health. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the specific mechanisms by which these drugs’ molecular targets interact with the cardiovascular system.

The study employs Mendelian Randomization (MR) method to investigate the potential relationship between anti-allergic medications and cardiovascular diseases8. By leveraging genetic variations as IVs, MR methodology effectively mitigates the influence of confounding factors, providing a more robust basis for inferring causal relationships. This approach is particularly suited for assessing drug effects as it emulates the conditions of randomized controlled trials (RCT), thereby reducing biases commonly associated with traditional observational studies. In the sensitivity analysis, methodologies such as Cochran’s Q test and MR-Egger intercept test were utilized to identify and correct for potential pleiotropy biases, thereby offering more precise estimates of causal effects. The innovation of this study lies in the comprehensive application of various analytical methods, including Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analysis and enrichment analysis, to evaluate the relationship between anti-allergic drugs and CVDs from multiple perspectives. This multifaceted approach not only enhances the validity of the research findings but also uncovers the molecular mechanisms and potential biomarkers of action for anti-allergic drugs.

The overall workflow of the study is illustrated in Fig.1.

Using the DrugBank and DGidb databases, a total of 139 target genes for anti-allergy drugs were identified (Supplementary Table1). The 139 eQTLs data utilized in this study were sourced from the eQTLGen Consortium (https://eqtlgen.org/)9. The data encompasses a broad range of blood samples from predominantly healthy European individuals, establishing a solid basis for the analytical approach.

Outcome data were drawn from the OpenGWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/) and the FinnGen database. As elaborated in Supplementary Table2, these resources provide a wealth of detailed information on various cardiovascular conditions, including CAD, HF, AF, and MI.

The R package “TwoSampleMR” was utilized to extract eQTL exposure data along with corresponding outcome data for CAD, HF, AF, and MI. The eQTLs were then subjected to stringent criteria for selection to ensure the reliability of instrumental variables (IVs)10,11. Details of the selection process are presented in the Supplementary Materials.

MR analyses were conducted using five methods, primarily the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach. AP-value < 0.05 indicated a significant exposure-outcome causality. Cochran’s Q test was performed to assess heterogeneity. Horizontal pleiotropy was examined via the MR-Egger intercept test12.

Enrichment analysis was conducted using the “clusterProfiler”13R package (version 4.10.1), leveraging data from the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases14–16(details are provided in the Supplementary Materials).

From the intersecting genes identified through two MR analyses, a further selection was made using GEO analysis to pinpoint those with differential expression between disease and control groups, which were then considered as the final results (details are provided in the Supplementary Materials)17.

The DSigDB (Drug Signatures Database,http://dsigdb.tanlab.org/DSigDBv1.0/)18was used to predict potential candidate drugs for the identified drug target genes and evaluate their therapeutic potential. In order to discover and validate potential candidate drugs that may bind to the target genes of anti-allergic drugs, molecular docking study was performed. Using the PDB format files for the protein receptors and the SDF format files for the ligand drugs, molecular docking was performed by the CB-Dock2 online tool19–22(details are provided in the Supplementary Materials).

Given the pivotal roles of ITGB2 and TG, their links to prednisone and HF, it is imperative to evaluate the safety profile of prednisone in combination with cardiovascular drugs. Data for the analysis of adverse effects were collected and extracted from the publicly available FAERS database, covering the period from Q1 2004 to Q2 2024 (details are provided in the Supplementary Materials). Exceeding the threshold criteria for the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) algorithms is defined as generating an adverse drug reactions (ADR) signal, thereby indicating a potential risk and enhancing signal detection sensitivity (Supplementary Tables3–4).

In the discovery cohorts’ MR analysis, 29 eQTLs were found to be significantly associated with CAD risk (P< 0.05), 41 eQTLs with HF risk (P< 0.05), 37 eQTLs with AF risk (P< 0.05), and 44 eQTLs with MI risk (P< 0.05) (Fig.2, Supplementary Fig.1, and Supplementary Tables5–8). Cochran’s Q indicated that the MR analysis was not affected by heterogeneity, whereas MR-Egger intercept sensitivity test indicated that the results was not influenced by significant pleiotropy (Supplementary Table7).

The vertical dashed line represents an OR value of 1, while the horizontal dashed line represents a P value of 0.05. Yellow dots represent genes with positive significant effects (OR > 1), blue dots denote genes with negative significant effects (OR < 1), and grey dots indicate non-significant genes.

Replicate MR analysis showed that 34 eQTLs had causal relationships with CAD risk (P< 0.05), 39 eQTLs with HF risk (P< 0.05), 40 eQTLs with AF risk (P< 0.05), and 44 eQTLs with MI risk (P< 0.05) (Supplementary Fig.2and Supplementary Tables6–8). By intersecting the significant genes from both the discovery and replication cohorts and excluding genes with inconsistent effect directions, 51 eQTLs were identified as significantly associated with these four CVDs (Supplementary Table9).

Enrichment analysis was subsequently performed on the 51 intersecting genes. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed the top 30 significant pathways, emphasizing those related to CVDs (Fig.3A). Notably, a multitude of enriched terms are significantly correlated with the progression of CVDs. For instance, KEGG pathway analysis revealed “lipid and atherosclerosis”, “fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis”, and “arachidonic acid metabolism” as prominent pathways (Fig.3). Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis underscored several cardinal cardiovascular-related terms, such as “fatty acid metabolic processes”, “membrane rafts”, “histone deacetylase binding” (Fig.4and Supplementary Table10). These findings collectively suggest that the intersecting genes may be pertinent to the risk of CVDs.

For a thorough analysis, the intersecting data was validated from both the discovery and replication cohorts using GEO database, focusing on results with significant relevance. Ultimately, KAT2A was identified as significantly impacting CAD risk, eight eQTLs (HPGD, GLS, AMD1, TSHR, CLOCK, POLB, ITGB2, TG) as significantly affecting HF risk, and two eQTLs (BAZ2B, CYP2C8) as significantly influencing AF risk. Notably, TSHR, ITGB2, and TG were positively correlated with HF risk, while other genes (KAT2A, HPGD, GLS, AMD1, CLOCK, POLB, BAZ2B, and CYP2C8) exhibited negative correlations with their respective diseases (Supplementary Tables11and Supplementary Fig.3–5).

After identifying genes potentially causally linked to CVD risk, the DSigDB was utilized to search for candidate drugs capable of interacting with these target genes. Based on adjustedp-values, the top 10 potential chemical compounds were identified (Supplementary Table12), including GOSSYPOL, EBSELEN, MYRICETIN, HEXACHLOROPHENE and PENTABROMOPHENOL. The results indicate that GOSSYPOL is the most significant drug, associated with the genes POLB, KAT2A, HPGD, BAZ2B, and TSHR. Figure5highlights the interactions between targets of anti-allergic drugs and candidate drugs like quercetin, which potentially impact cardiovascular system.

Supplementary Tables13–14presents the effective docking results of the top three significant candidate drugs and the top four candidate drugs that may impact cardiovascular system. Figure5illustrates the docking scenarios of drugs with low binding energies to proteins. Notably, the interaction between POLB and MYRICETIN BOSS exhibited the lowest binding energy of -11.2 kcal/mol, indicating a highly stable interaction.

In this study, ITGB2 and TG were identified as targets associated with elevated expression in HF. MR and GEO analyses confirmed these targets as risk factors, linked to the anti-allergy drug prednisone. Data from the FAERS database facilitated the analysis of adverse effects, comparing the combination of prednisone with cardiovascular medications to their use alone, revealing potential exacerbation of HF symptoms (Supplementary Materials and Supplementary Table16). As depicted in Fig.6, the combination use of prednisone with cardiovascular medications such as digoxin, metoprolol, candesartan cilexetil, enalapril, and simvastatin exhibited amplified adverse reaction signals for HF (ROR > 1). The findings indicate that the concurrent use of prednisone with various cardiovascular drugs may increase the risk of HF.

A comprehensive MR analysis was performed on 139 eQTLs linked to anti-allergic drugs within discovery cohorts of 122,733 CAD patients, 68,157 HF patients, 395,795 MI patients, and 60,620 AF patients. Subsequently, these eQTLs were validated in replication cohorts including 42,096 CAD patients, 47,309 HF patients, 28,546 MI patients, and 55,853 AF patients. The analysis identified 51 eQTLs associated with anti-allergic drugs that are linked to CVDs. Specifically, 8 eQTLs were related to CAD, 34 to HF, 9 to AF, and 13 to MI. Enrichment analysis emphasized the importance of pathways such as lipid and atherosclerosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and the thyroid hormone signaling pathway. Furthermore, 11 eQTLs were identified with stronger associations to CVDs, including KAT2A, HPGD, GLS, AMD1, TSHR, CLOCK, POLB, ITGB2, TG, BAZ2B, and CYP2C8.The FAERS database enabled analysis of cardiovascular adverse events associated with prednisone (an anti-allergic drug), identifying ITGB2 and TG as high-risk targets in HF patients.

Numerous studies have reported the potential impact of anti-allergic drugs on CVDs. For example, cohort and retrospective studies have found that some antihistamines, such as second-generation antihistamines and β2 receptor agonists, are associated with the development of cardiovascular events like HF and arrhythmias23. However, a study has shown that the target TRPV2, inhibited by the anti-allergic drug tranilast, may be a novel therapeutic target for HF5. Ingelsson E and colleagues conducted a cohort study indicating that montelukast may have a potential role in the secondary prevention of recurrent CVDs24. Similarly, Göbel et al. reported that zafirlukast could confer cardiovascular benefits by inhibiting soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)25.

In the study of 11 eQTLs linked to anti-allergic drugs, it was observed that several drug targets influence the development of CVDs through pathways related to lipid metabolism and signal transduction. This finding may shed light on the biological mechanisms underlying the causal relationship between anti-allergic drugs and CVDs risk. This research highlights a negative correlation between KAT2A and CAD. KAT2A (the drug target identified by database screening is zafirlukast)may improve heart function by modulating histone acetylation and the expression of antioxidant genes through the thyroid hormone signaling pathway and histone modifying activity26,27Additionally, zafirlukast affects other targets such as BAZ2B and POLB. BAZ2B is a chromatin remodeling factor involved in cardiovascular immune regulation28,29while POLB plays a crucial role in DNA repair, which is vital for maintaining cardiovascular cell genome stability30. TSHR, a G-protein coupled receptor located on thyroid cells, regulates thyroid function. TSHR (the drug target identified by database screening is loratadine)may enhance thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion via the cAMP signaling pathway and cellular response to peptide processes. However, TSHR may also induce mitochondrial oxidative damage in endothelial cells, potentially affecting heart function31,32. We screened the database and identified prednisone as a potential targeted drug for ITGB2, an integrin beta-2 subunit involved in inflammation. ITGB2,has the potential to modulate immune and inflammatory signaling in myocardial cells by impacting pathways such as neutrophil extracellular trap formation and membrane raft composition33,34. This interaction could impact heart function and adaptability, potentially leading to HF. TG, a precursor in the synthesis of thyroid hormone, is also targeted by prednisone potentially impacting cardiovascular health through modulation of thyroid hormone levels35. Finally, montelukast targets CYP2C8, a key enzyme involved in drug metabolism, potentially modulating lipid levels and influencing drug metabolism through its impact on lipid and atherosclerosis pathways36,37.

The present study identifies two drug targets, ITGB2 and TG, which exhibit a causal relationship with HF and demonstrate high expression levels in HF. These targets are linked to prednisone, a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Prednisone is widely used to manage various inflammatory conditions, but its multi-target effects may result in complex drug interactions, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular adverse events when combined with HF medications. Firstly, the research suggests that prednisone might exacerbate heart function by affecting pathways involved in neutrophil extracellular trap formation, membrane raft components, and myocardial cell metabolism. Additionally, prednisone could activate the Atrogin-1 pathway, leading to myocardial cell atrophy and compromised cardiac contractility38. Secondly, the concurrent use of prednisone with HF medications could lead to drug interactions. For example, co-administration of prednisone with digoxin may alter digoxin’s pharmacokinetics, increasing its blood concentration39. Prednisone may also argument the cardiovascular system’s responsiveness to catecholamines, thereby elevating the risk of HF exacerbation. Therefore, HF patients should be closely monitored for potential drug interactions and adverse effects when using prednisone in combination with other HF treatments.

Firstly, the association between anti-allergic drugs and CVD outcomes was examined and validated within two independent cohorts, thereby enhancing the reliability of the results. Secondly, multiple analytical methods were employed to test these associations, with the consistency across various datasets further supporting the findings. Thirdly, by utilizing FAERS database information in conjunction with drug labels, the credibility of the conclusions was strengthened. However, some limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings. Firstly, the analysis primarily focused on European populations, and further validation is required to determine if these findings are generalizable to other populations, as genetic variants in drug-metabolizing genes (e.g., CYP2C19) show ethnic-specific frequencies that may alter drug efficacy. Additionally, the study did not stratify prednisone exposure by dose or duration, limiting the ability to distinguish between short-term (low-risk) and chronic (high-risk) cardiovascular effects—FAERS data aggregating events across all exposure scenarios may overstate clinical concerns for routine short-term use. Although sensitivity analyses (MR-Egger, weighted median) were performed to detect pleiotropy, residual effects from unmeasured confounders cannot be ruled out, and eQTLs used as IVs may not fully capture anti-allergic drugs’ pharmacodynamic effects as they reflect genetic variation rather than direct drug-target interactions. The linkage between genes (e.g., KAT2A) and anti-allergic drugs (e.g., zafirlukast), inferred from databases (DGIdb, DrugBank), lacks direct human evidence, introducing mechanistic uncertainties. Future research should delve into different doses and treatment regimens for specific patient subgroups, validate findings in multi-ethnic cohorts, explore specific interactions between more anti-allergic and cardiovascular drugs, and strengthen mechanistic links through large-scale prospective cohort studies and experimental validation.

Through an initial comprehensive analysis, this study revealed a causal link between anti-allergic drugs and CVD risk, which provides medication recommendations for secondary prevention of CVDs.
