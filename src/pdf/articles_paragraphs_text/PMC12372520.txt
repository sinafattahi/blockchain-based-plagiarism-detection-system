Dombeya wallichii, which was recently introduced to China, possesses unique ornamental value. The aim of this study was to obtain the complete chloroplast genome sequence ofD. wallichiiusing the high-throughput sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina HiSeq 6000 platform, thereby supporting its taxonomic and evolutionary research. The chloroplast genome inD. wallichiiexhibited a total length of 161,278 bp, with the structural organization comprising four distinct components: a large single-copy (LSC) region spanning 89,968 bp, a small single-copy (SSC) segment measuring 20,448 bp, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions each extending 25,431 bp. Regarding base composition analysis, the LSC region displayed a GC content of 34.3%, while the SSC and IR regions showed respective values of 30.8% and 43.1%.The phylogenetic analysis showed thatD. wallichiiwas closely related to theCorchoropsisspecies and shared a common ancestor.

Dombeya wallichii(Lindl.) Benth. ex Baill. 1885, a member of the Malvaceae family, is celebrated for its magnificent pink flower clusters (Rocha et al.2011). As a species with high ornamental value (Yi2023) and potential as a breeding resource for native Malvaceae species in China,D. wallichiihas been introduced by the Chengdu Botanical Garden.

In March 2024, leaves were collected from theD. wallichiiplants located in the Chengdu Botanical Garden (30°40′N, 104°10′E). The collection of materials adhered to the guidelines established by the Chengdu Botanical Garden, and no special permission statement was necessary for the process (Figure 1). The sample was identified and collected by the author, and the voucher specimen was deposited in Sichuan University Museum (https://scudm.scu.edu.cn, Jinbo Tan,jinbotan@scu.edu.cn) under the voucher number WYZ20250304.

Chloroplast genomic DNA was isolated using standardized CTAB protocols from silica-dried plant tissues. (Rishi et al.2021). Subsequently, the sample ofD. wallichiiunderwent re-sequencing using paired-end sequencing with 150 bp on the Illumina Hiseq 6000 platform at Novogene (Beijing, China), employing the Genome Skimming technique. Following quality control, clean data were generated by removing adapters and low-quality reads. The raw data consist of 3.9 GB. The Q30 of the sequencing data used for assembly is greater than 93%. Plastome assembly was conducted through the implementation of GetOrganelle version 1.7.7.1 (Jin et al.2020) within a standardized bioinformatics pipeline. Plastid Genome Annotator (PGA) (Qu et al.2019) was used to annotate the plastomes and used a previously published plastome ofCorchoropsis crenata(PP840629) as a reference. The annotation results were then checked in Geneious Prime v2025.0.2 (Kearse et al.2012) and manually adjusted and corrected any errors. The circular chloroplast genome visualization ofD. wallichiiwas constructed employing the Chloroplast Genome Viewers (CPGView)(Liu et al.2023), following established genome mapping protocols.

Phylogenetic analyses based on 49 complete chloroplast genomes clarifiedD. wallichii’s molecular position relative to other related species. TheGrewia chungii(NC-054166) was used as the out group. Chloroplast genome sequence alignment was executedviaMAFFT v7.490 (Katoh and Standley2013) embedded within Geneious Prime’s computational environment, maintaining default algorithmic parameters. Subsequently, maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted through PhyloSuite (http://phylosuite.jushengwu.com/) (Zhang et al.2020) with model specifications configured as GTR substitution matrix and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic tree graphical annotation was implemented through iTOL v6 (Letunic and Bork2024) with enhanced topological features, following standard phylogenetic visualization protocols.

The completed annotation of theD. wallichiichloroplast genome has been deposited in GenBank under accession numberPV275532. The chloroplast genome ofD. wallichiiis 161,278 base pairs (bp) long, with an average coverage depth of 1,486× (minimum 615×, maximum 2,697×) (Figure S1), a typical quadripartite structure, and the highest proportion of thymine (T) at 32.2%. It included two IRs regions (25,431 bp each), an SSC region (20,448 bp), and an LSC region (89,968 bp). The GC contents of LSC, SSC, and two IRs were 34.3%, 30.8%, and 43.1%, respectively (Figure 2). Computational annotation of theD. wallichiichloroplast genome identified 129 functional genetic elements, comprising a functional triad of 84 protein-encoding loci, 37 transfer RNA genes, and eight ribosomal RNA genes.Dombeya wallichiihas unique genetic characteristics: theinfAgene and a single copy ofycf1are missing. Among cis-splicing genes, nine genes (rpl2, rpl16, rps16, atpF, rpoC1, ndhA, ndhB, petB, petD) contain one intron, and two genes (ycf3andclpP) contain two introns (Figure S2). In the trans-splicing gene map, the trans-splicing gene (rps12) has three unique exons, with two in the inverted repeat and thus duplicate (Figure S3). Additionally, the results of the gene collinearity analysis indicate thatD. wallichiishows slight rearrangements compared to its close relatives (Figure S4). Compared with its related genera, the IRa ofD. wallichiihas a slight expansion toward theycf1andtrnHgenes, and the IRb has a slight expansion toward therps19gene (Figure S5).

The circular map of the chloroplast genome was created using the CPGview tool, available athttp://47.96.249.172:16085/cpgview/home.Genesare categorized by function and assigned corresponding colors. The transcription orientations of the genes on the inner and outer circles are clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively. A legend for the functional classification of the genes is provided in the lower left corner.

The study thoroughly examined the phylogenetic relationships among 49 species based on their complete chloroplast genome sequences (Figure 3).Dombeya wallichiioccupies a relatively independent position within the Malvaceae family, and its closest relatives are theC. crenata, which also belongs to Subfamily Dombeyoideae. The next most closely related species arePterospermum kingtungense,Pterospermum truncatolobatum,andExcentrodendron hsienmu, which are grouped within the same clade. The results are in good agreement with the phylogenetic tree of Malvaceae based on nuclear genes in a previous article (Le Péchon et al.2010). SSR analysis (Figure S6) reveals that compared withP. kingtungense,P. truncatolobatum, andE. hsienmu,D. wallichiiis more similar toC. crenata. This similarity indirectly supports the closer phylogenetic relationship betweenD. wallichiiandC. crenata, validating the phylogenetic results.

Dombeya wallichiiis a highly ornamental urban greening tree widely planted in the tropics but newly introduced to China. This study first completed the sequencing and assembly of theD. wallichiichloroplast genome, with a length of 161,278 bp and encoding 129 genes. The chloroplast genome manifests a canonical four-segment architectural organization and its size is comparable to that of its close relatives. Phylogenetic analyses based on complete chloroplast genome sequences can offer improved resolution that aligns with morphological observations (Lee et al.2021).

The chloroplast genomic architecture in this study provides new phylogenetic perspectives, aiding in understanding evolutionary trajectories and taxonomic delineation in theDombeya. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on chloroplast genomic data of 49 Malvaceae species, clarifyingD. wallichii’s taxonomic position in Malvaceae and its phylogenetic relationships with other congeners. The placement ofD. wallichiiin a more distant branch of the phylogenetic tree indicates that its divergence occurred relatively recently.Dombeya wallichiiandC. crenataform a sister relationship, and this clade is sister to the clade formed byPterospermumandExcentrodendron.This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies (Jung et al.2024). The four genera form a common clade (Subfamily Dombeyoideae), which is consistent with the classification of the APG IV system (The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group2016).

The phylogenetic tree showed distant relationships between closely related species in the same genus (TiliaandHibiscus), suggesting that the taxonomic status of some Malvaceae genera may need reevaluation. Further analysis requires combining nuclear genomic data ofD. wallichiiwith congeneric species data to exploreDombeya’s phylogenetic relationships. More evidence on morphological comparisons betweenD. wallichiiand its congeners is needed in future studies to support the results of its taxonomic status from molecular studies.

The project concept, sample collection, experimental design and operation, and article writing were all completed by Yuanzhuo Wu.
