Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) has garnered significant attention in the field of flexible optoelectronics due to its unique properties. This study investigates the effect of incorporating tin oxide (SnO) nanoparticles (NPs) with various concentrations (0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt%) on structural, optical, and dielectric properties of PVA films synthesized via the solution casting technique. XRD analysis revealed a 28% increase in crystallite size (from 25.74 to 32.88 nm) and reduced dislocation with rising SnO content, indicating enhanced structural ordering. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was confirmed homogeneous nanoparticle (NP) distribution at ≤ 3 wt% but aggregation for 5 wt%. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy were verified hydrogen bonding between SnO and PVA hydroxyl groups. Optical band gap energy was decreased systematically from 4.59 eV (pure PVA) to 4.18 eV (5 wt% SnO), confirming enhanced semiconducting behavior. Photoluminescence (PL) intensity was quenched significantly own to SnO-PVA cross-linking, with new SnO-related emission peaks emerging at 432 nm. The dispersion and the dielectric parameters were determined as functions of SnO concentrations. Nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ(3)) and nonlinear refractive index (n2) rushed to 48.84 × 10−15and 11.43 × 10−13esu, respectively for 5 wt% SnO film, demonstrating strong potential for nonlinear devices. These results highlight PVA/SnO films as promising candidates for flexible optoelectronics application.

Polymers are crucial to advancing optical communication technologies due to their versatility, cost-effectiveness, and performance benefits across a wide range of photonic applications1. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of dye-doped polymers due to their numerous advantages, particularly in linear and nonlinear photonic devices2,3. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on evaluating polymers’ optical and electrical properties. Their enhanced polarization, reflection, anti-reflection, and interference properties are crucial to numerous technologies, such as optical devices4–6. Among many fundamental and widely utilized polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) stands out for its low flammability and extraordinary chemical resistance7. PVA is mostly utilized as a finishing and sizing agent in the textile industry8. PVA, a synthetic linear polymer, displays noteworthy water solubility, high optical transparency, and excellent film-forming capabilities. Its inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity further improve its utility. These combined properties processability from aqueous solutions, optical clarity, non-corrosiveness, robust film formation, biocompatibility, and biodegradability enable diverse applications. Particularly, PVA is incorporated into water-soluble fabrics for producing biodegradable items such as protective clothing, wipes, sponges, sheets, hospital laundry bags, covers, and other physiological hygiene products9–11. The optical and electrical features of polymers can be changed by adding dopants like nanoparticles, organic dyes, quantum dots, and other substances that work with the main material. Consequently, polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) composites have garnered significant research interest as a versatile platform for tailoring material properties to meet specific application requirements. These composite systems exhibit enhanced multifunctional properties including thermal, mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics compared to pure polymers. Moreover, the incorporation of nanoparticles can improve the amorphous nature of the synthesized PNP, contributing to these performance improvements12–17. The efficacy of nanocomposite materials in optoelectronic applications can be assessed through a comprehensive investigation of optical characteristics like optical energy gap, optical constants, and dielectric constants, which can be derived from the spectroscopic characteristics of PVA nanocomposite films. These parameters are crucial for several different uses18–21.

Tin oxides can be utilized as dopants/fillers to modify structural, physical properties of PVA. Research has demonstrated that the incorporation of tin oxides into PVA matrices leads to significant alterations in its properties, enhancing its suitability for a wide variety of applications, including optoelectronics, sensors, and functional coatings22–25. Among tin oxides, SnO received considerable attention for photonic applications due to its p-type conductivity, and high theoretical specific capacity26,27. In contrast to SnO₂, SnO exhibits distinct physicochemical properties and applications. Notably, SnO is cost-effective, naturally abundant, and possesses high optical transparency combined with low electrical resistivity. These characteristics render SnO a promising candidate for next-generation transparent flexible electronics devices. Additionally, SnO is well-suited for use in electrochromic devices, solar cells, and transparent conductive oxide (TCO)28–32. Its high sensitivity to low gas concentrations further makes it an effective material for gas sensing applications32.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies to date that describe the targeted modification of structural and linear/nonlinear optical properties in PVA matrices using SnO NPs, which remains underexplored. This research gap is significant, as SnO NPs offer distinct advantages over the more commonly studied tin dioxide (SnO₂), notably their inherent p-type conductivity, a critical requirement for emerging flexible optoelectronic applications such as transparent transistors, hole-transport layers in photovoltaics, and p-type elements in complementary circuits. Thus, successfully blending SnO NPs into PVA to harness these properties while maintaining even distribution, consistent film quality, and easy processing presents a major challenge. These include mitigating nanoparticle aggregation and controlling interfacial interactions. This work systematically addresses this gap by investigating the fundamental influence of SnO NPs concentration on the structure-property relationships within PVA nanocomposites, aiming to unlock their potential for advanced optoelectronic devices.

PVA ([CH2CH (OH)] n) was sourced from LOBA Chemie, and tin oxide (SnO) was acquired from Sigma Aldrich. PVA and PVA–SnO nanocomposite films were fabricated using the solution casting method. Initially, 2 g of PVA were dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was stirred at 75 °C with a stirring speed of 900 rpm for 3 h. To prepare PVA-SnO nanocomposite films, SnO nanoparticles were incorporated into the PVA solution at concentrations of 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% relative to PVA weight. To promote dispersion and mitigate nanoparticle agglomeration, each mixture was sonicated and subsequently stirred at 30 °C and 900 rpm for 1 h prior to casting. The resulting homogeneous solutions were cast onto Petri dishes and dried in a convection oven at 55 °C for 24 h (see Schematic1).

where,​ represents the weight of the SnO nanoparticles and​ denotes the weight of the PVA polymeric blend. This approach ensures a uniform distribution of SnO nanoparticles within the PVA matrix, facilitating the investigation of their influence on the composite’s properties.

The crystal structures of all materials were analyzed using XRD technique (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance with a monochromatic Cu-Kαradiation source λ = 1.54056 Å) operating at 40 kv and 60 mA in 2θ = 20–70orange. In order to examine the functional groups, FTIR spectra were recorded using a Bruker VERTEX 80 combined Platinum Diamond ATR, which consists of a diamond disc as an internal reflector in the range of 4000–400 cm−1with resolution 4 cm−1. The Raman spectrum of the PVA/SnO films was examined by Raman spectrometer (Jasco NRS-2100) at room temperature in the spectral range between 80 and 3200 cm−1. Using a SEM model Quanta FEG250 and an EDS, morphology investigation and elemental quantification were carried out, respectively. The optical properties of samples were analyzed by UV–Vis spectroscopy using a (JASCO 670 UV–vis-NIR) spectrophotometer within wavelength range of 200–2500 nm. The emission spectra of the same sample were also measured using a JASCO FP-8500 spectrofluorometer, with an excitation wavelength set at 330 nm.

In this context, d (~ 200 ± 5 μm) refers to the thickness of the sample. Table1lists values of D, δ, εs, and Ncfor various concentrations of SnO. It is evident that when the concentration of SnO increases, the crystallite size values are raised from 25.74 to 32.88 nm, while δ, εs, and Ncvalues are decreased. As the concentration of SnO increases, more point defects are eliminated from the films, and the growth of crystallites along with fewer grain boundaries shows that high-quality PVA/SnO nanocomposite films are being made41.

The FTIR spectra of PVA and PVA/SnO nanocomposite films recorded within the wavenumber range of 400–3500 cm−1are shown in Fig. (2a). To effectively distinguish between different peaks and clearly show the SnO peak, this spectrum is displayed in two figures: 400–3500 cm−1in Fig. (2a) and 400–1000 cm−1in Fig. (2b). In Fig. (2a) the typical transmittance peaks for PVA are located at 3269 cm−1(O–H stretching), 2906 cm−1(asymmetric stretching of CH2), 1711 cm−1(water absorption), 1417 cm−1(bending of CH2), and 1325 cm−1(δ(OH), rocking with CH wagging)34extending the C-O shoulder stretching in the crystalline sequence of PVA at 1141 cm−1, whereas the amorphous sequence of PVA involves bending the OH and stretching of C–O at 1087 cm−1, 916 cm−1(CH2rocking), 843 cm−1(C–C stretching)42. It was expected that the nanostructured Sn–O sharp peak would exhibit a stretching vibration at 598 cm−122as show in Fig. (2b).

Raman spectroscopy provides a dependable method for detecting the presence of nanoparticles and examining their interactions with polymers by analysing variations in peak locations and intensities. The spectra of SnO (5%)-doped PVA and pure PVA films (see Fig.3) exhibit characteristic vibrational modes, including a prominent band near 2900 ± 10 cm⁻¹ attributed to the C–H stretching vibrations of –CH₂ groups in the PVA matrix43–45as well as additional vibrational features such as 1325 ± 10 cm⁻¹ (CH₂ wagging/C–H bending), 903 ± 5 cm⁻¹ (C–C stretching), 636 ± 5 cm⁻¹ (C–O–C bending), 466 ± 3 cm⁻¹ (C–C bending), and 280 ± 3 cm⁻¹ (skeletal bending), appeared in the SnO-doped PVA and undoped sample. When SnO is added, this mode shifts in position and strength, showing that the SnO nanoparticles are interacting with the PVA matrix and changing its local chemical environment. Notably, the emergence of SnO-specific Egand A₁gmodes at 109 and 208 cm⁻¹26,27respectively, upshifted relative to bulk SnO, confirms successful incorporation.

The surface morphology of the films is analyzed using SEM to evaluate effects of surface modification. Figure4(a-c) presents the SEM images of pristine PVA, PVA/SnO − 2% and PVA/SnO − 5% films, respectively. Figure4a reveals a smooth and homogeneous surface of the pure PVA film, with no observable particles. In contrast, Fig.4b demonstrates the incorporation of smaller SnO particles at lower concentrations (2 wt %), which exhibit minimal impact on the overall morphology of the composite film. However, as the SnO concentration increases to 5 wt%, distinct particle aggregation and the formation of distribution clusters are observed on the PVA surface, as shown in Fig.4c. This aggregation is accompanied by a significant increase in particle size and a reduction in the mean interparticle distance. According to Goud et al., this phenomenon can be attributed to the agglomeration of PVA chain molecules, leading to the formation of large, intensely white-colored particles. The enhanced surface area of SnO nanoparticles, due to their nano-filler properties, makes them suitable for applications such as gas sensing in detection devices [40]. Furthermore, Fig.5a provides a cross-sectional SEM image of the PVA/SnO − 5% film, highlighting the uniform dispersion of SnO particles within the polymer matrix. The samples thicknesses are determined through direct measurement of cross-sectional SEM image. Using the image analysis software (Image J), thickness values are obtained at five spatially distributed locations across each nanocomposite film. The reported thickness of 200 ± 5 μm represents the mean values with standard deviation, ensuring statistical reliability for subsequent optical property calculations. EDX analysis of the PVA/SnO − 5% film, depicted in Fig.5b, confirms the presence of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and tin (Sn) as the sole elemental components, validating the composition of the composite film. Thus, the structural results (XRD, FT-IR, Raman spectra, SEM images, and EDX analysis) confirm the successful incorporation of SnO into PVA matrix.

where,is optical energy band gap, r is an exponent that have values of 1, 2, 3, 1/2, or 3/2 depending on the type of electronic transitions causing the optical absorption, A is a constant, and hυ is the energy of the photon. Values of optical energy gap for each electronic transition are obtained by extrapolating the straight lines parts of curves to0 (see Fig. (7b)) and are tabulated in Table2. It is clearly shown that when the SnO concentration increases, the optical band gap values decrease. The obtained results demonstrate that the bandgap structure of SnO/PVA nanocomposites can be effectively modulated by varying the SnO-to-PVA ratio within the blend. Furthermore, the incorporation of SnO facilitates the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) networked structure within the polymer matrix, creating conductive pathways that enhance the semiconducting properties of the composite49. This structural modification leads to a reduction in the optical bandgap from 4.59 to 4.18 eV, as evidenced by the data presented in Table2. These findings highlight the potential of SnO as functional filler for tailoring the electronic and optical properties of PVA-based materials. The comparison ofvalues shown in Table3provides important information about our study compared to earlier research. In this study on PVA/SnO nanocomposites, it is different from earlier research because it uses a small amount of SnO nano-fillers (2–5 wt%), which results in a significant drop in the indirectto 4.18 eV. This improvement contrasts with reported nanocomposites employing diverse fillers (e.g., Al₂O₃, CaThO₃, Co⁺, CuO, Fe₂O₃, NiO, TiO₂)43,50–53which often required higher filler loadings (e.g., up to 10 wt% for Co⁺) to attain comparable bandgap modulation. The effectiveness of SnO at this lower amount leads tovalues that are as good as those from well-known fillers like TiO₂, Al₂O₃50and CuO43NPs, while also providing important practical benefits: using less filler lowers production costs and greatly reduces the chance of harmful clumping of the nano-fillers that can happen with higher amounts. This work shows that SnO is useful filler for adjusting the bandgap in PVA-based nanocomposites, enhancing their optical performance and making the materials cheaper and more reliable.

The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of pure PVA and PVA/SnO (2, 3, 4 and 5%) are examined, as showed in Fig.8. The PL spectra are gotten using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm. The PVA film showed a separate luminescence peak within the visible spectrum, ranging from 350 to 550 nm. The peak at 379 nm is attributed to the electronic transition (π* → n) of the hydroxyl groups in PVA, though the peak at 405 nm is linked with (π → π*) electronic transitions of the free hydroxyl (–OH) groups inside the PVA matrix54,55. The introduction of SnO into the PVA matrix resulted in a significant quenching of the luminescence intensity. The formation of cross-linking interactions between the (–OH) groups of PVA and the oxygen atoms of SnO is responsible for this quenching result54,55. The interactions change the electronic environment of the PVA matrix, which reduces the processes that create light, known as radiative recombination. The amount of quenching is found to be concentration-dependent, with higher SnO concentrations inducing more pronounced quenching effects. Specifically at (4 and 5%) films showed three emission peaks centered at approximately 432, 469, and 542 nm. The emission band at 432 nm is associated with the band emission of SnO, consistent with its band gap range of 2.7–3.4 eV26,27. The peaks at 469 and 542 nm are likely related to defects such as oxygen vacancies. As a result, the PL spectrum of PVA/SnO seems to include influences from both PVA and SnO nanoparticles29,56,57.

PL vs. wavelength (nm) for nanocomposite PVA/SnO film.

Figure (9a) shows the variation in the extinction coefficient k with wavelength for PVA-SnO films with varying SnO content. Extinction coefficient values are lower for PVA films and greater for PVA-SnO films. It was also shown that the deposited nanocomposites films had good optical transparency by the observed low value of extinction coefficient in the visible-NIR wavelength ranges, which showed negligible light loss from scattering60. The variation of the refractive index, n, with wavelength for samples is shown in Fig. (9b). It is also observed that an increase in the SnO content leads to a corresponding rise in the refractive index of PVA/SnO composites.

Extinction coefficient, k(a), and Reflective index n(b)for PVA/SnO films.

The incorporation of SnO NPs (5 wt%) into the PVA matrix elevates the refractive index from 1.71 (pristine PVA) to 2.16 at λ = 400 nm. This 26% enhancement arises from two synergistic factors: (i) the inherent high polarizability of Sn²⁺ ions and (ii) matrix densification due to SnO/PVA hydrogen bonding (confirmed via FT-IR/Raman). Critically, this performance exceeds that of PVA/SiO₂61nanocomposites (Δn = 18% at 10 wt%) and approaches PVA-CoO-SiO₂62ternary systems (n≈ 2.7 at 6 wt%), despite requiring lower filler content and simpler binary composition. The high refractive index (n> 2.0 across visible wavelengths) facilitates enhanced optical confinement, positioning these films as competitive candidates for waveguides, high-efficiency optical filters, and nonlinear photonic devices leveraging intense field-matter interactions60.

where, Edis the dispersive energy, which represents the average intensity of inter-band optical transitions, and Eois the single oscillator energy. As the (n2− 1)−1vs. (hv)2plot for PVA-SnO films is shown in Fig. (10a) to be linear, the Eoand Edvalues were calculated using the slopes and intercepts values of these plots, and the results are tabulated in Table (2). When the SnO content is increased from 2 to 5%, it was discovered that the Edvalues of these films increase from 9.28 to 14.17 eV. While, the Eovalues declined from 6.28 to 5.53 eV, suggesting a reduction in the average energy gap associated with the oscillator.

(a)Plots of (n2−1)−1vs. (hν)2(b)Plots of (n2−1)−1vs. λ−2for PVA-SnO films.

SnO/PVA films (5 wt%) exhibit superior dispersion properties and optical performance, evidenced by their significantly higher dispersion energy (Ed= 14.17 eV) and single oscillator energy (Eo= 5.53 eV) compared to PVA/CS/CuO (5 wt%)64(Ed= 2.54 eV, Eo= 4.24 eV), PVA/TiO₂65(5 wt%) (Ed= 11.8 eV, Eo= 2.75 eV) and PVA/TiO₂/MWCNT (0.01mg)66(Ed= 7.75 eV, Eo= 2.52 eV). This enhanced Edreflects stronger inter-band optical transitions and charge carrier interactions, while the elevated Eoindicates a more ordered electronic structure with reduced defects. Crucially, SnO achieves this with only 5 wt% loading lower than typical filler concentrations in competing systems enabling dramatic reductions in optical bandgap (28% decrease), and minimal nanoparticle aggregation.

where, λois the average oscillator wavelength and Sois the average oscillator wavelength. Plotting of (n2− 1)−1as a function of λ−2for the PVA/SnO nanocomposites films is shown in Fig. (10b). Table (2) lists the values of Soand λo, which were calculated from the plots’ linear fitting.

The variation of(a)real (ε1) and(b), imaginary (ε2) parts of the dielectric constant vs. the wavelength for PVA/SnO films.

where, εL​ is the lattice dielectric constant, e is the elementary charge, c is the speed of light, and N/m* represents the ratio of carrier concentration to the effective mass. Values of εL​and N/m* are derived from the intercept (λ2= 0) and the slope of the linear fit, respectively for PVA/SnO nanocomposite films (see Fig. (12)), these values are summarized in Table2.

From the Table2, it is evident that εL​increases with higher SnO content; indicating enhanced dielectric properties due to the incorporation of SnO nanoparticles. Additionally, the values of εL​ are consistently higher than those of the dielectric constant (ε∞​) at high-frequency. This discrepancy can be attributed to the increase in free carrier concentration within the nanocomposite films, which contributes to the lattice polarization and overall dielectric response66. The rise in free carrier concentration with increasing SnO content further enhances the material’s electrical and optical properties, making it suitable for applications in optoelectronics and photonics. The ability to tune εLand N/m* by varying the SnO concentration underscores the potential of PVA/SnO nanocomposites for advanced technological applications, such as sensors, energy storage devices, and optical coatings. These findings highlight the critical role of SnO nanoparticles in modifying the dielectric and electronic properties of the PVA matrix, offering a pathway for designing materials with tailored functionalities.

The variation of(a)VELF &(b)SELF vs. the wavelength for PVA/SnO films.

where, σ1​ and σ2​ represent the real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity, respectively, ω is the angular frequency of the incident light, and εo​ is the permittivity of free space. The optical conductivity is closely related to the dielectric properties of the material, as it depends on both the ε1and ε2. Figure14(a&b) illustrates the variation in optical conductivity as a function of wavelength for PVA/SnO nanocomposite films. It is observed that the optical conductivity increases with higher SnO content, particularly in the wavelength range below 250 nm. This rise in σ values indicates a highly excited electronic state or enhanced absorbance in the material, suggesting improved charge carrier generation and transport properties73. However, as the photon energy increases beyond the absorption edge, the optical conductivity decreases sharply, which corresponds to the optical band gap of the material. This behavior is consistent with the optical band gap values presented in Table2, confirming the influence of SnO doping on the electronic structure of PVA. The decrease in optical conductivity at higher photon energies can be attributed to the reduced availability of electronic states for excitation, as well as potential structural modifications induced by the charge ordering effect. These structural changes, which are critical in determining the optical properties of the films, may arise from the incorporation of SnO nanoparticles into the PVA matrix. The enhancement in optical conductivity with increasing SnO content highlights the potential of these nanocomposites for optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting devices, where efficient charge carrier generation and transport are essential. The study of optical conductivity provides valuable insights into the electronic and optical behavior of PVA/SnO nanocomposites, demonstrating their tunable properties and potential for advanced technological applications.

Figure15(a&b) illustrates the variation of χ(3)andwith wavelength for PVA/SnO nanocomposite films. Both χ(3)andexhibit a decreasing trend with increasing wavelength. The calculations ofand,at the zero-frequency (hυ = 0) using Eqs.19&20are tabled in Table2. However, as the SnO content increases in the films, Values of χ3andrise significantly. SnO/PVA films exhibit a significant enhancement in third-order nonlinear optical response relative to PVA/TiO₂/MWCNT66nanocomposites films. At 5 wt% SnO loading, SnO/PVA achieves (χ⁽³⁾) and (n₂) values of 2.94 × 10⁻¹³ esu and 5.87 × 10⁻¹² esu (at hν→0), respectively. This represents enhancement over PVA/TiO₂@MWCNT (χ⁽³⁾ = 20.37 × 10⁻¹⁵ esu, n₂ = 38.42 × 10⁻¹⁴ esu at 0.01 MWCNT). This enhancement in nonlinear optical properties is attributed to the increased polarization of the polymer matrix at higher SnO concentrations, which allows for greater absorption of electromagnetic waves and improved NLO responses74. The reduction in the optical band gap with increasing SnO content further contributes to the enhanced nonlinearity, as it facilitates electronic transitions and charge carrier generation. The improved NLO properties of PVA/SnO nanocomposites make them promising candidates for nonlinear optoelectronic devices, such as optical limiters, modulators, and switches. The incorporation of SnO nanoparticles into the PVA matrix introduces Sn²⁺ free ions with high polarizability and bonded oxygen atoms, which are responsible for the observed increase in nonlinear optical parameters76. These findings suggest that increasing the SnO content in the polymer matrix is an effective strategy for tailoring the NLO properties of the material, making it suitable for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications. The tunable nonlinear optical properties of PVA/SnO nanocomposite films, driven by SnO concentration, highlight their potential for use in next-generation optical technologies. The interplay between structural modifications, electronic transitions, and polarizability underscores the importance of these materials in the field of nonlinear optics.

In this work, we systematically studied structural, optical, and photoluminescence properties of PVA/SnO nanocomposite films, synthesized via a solution-casting technique. XRD confirmed that SnO incorporation reduced PVA’s amorphous phase, increasing crystallite size by 28% (25.74 → 32.88 nm) while lowering dislocation density (1.51 × 10¹⁵ → 0.92 × 10¹⁵ m⁻²). Homogeneous NP dispersion (< 3 wt %) transitions to aggregation at 5 wt% (SEM), establishing a critical loading threshold. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the successful integration of SnO nanoparticles into the PVA matrix, with distinct vibrational peaks corresponding to Sn-O bonds observed at 598 cm−1. In addition, Specific Egand A₁gmodes of SnO at 109 and 208 cm⁻¹were confirmed by Raman spectra. The band gap narrows from 4.59 eV (pristine PVA) to 4.18 eV (5 wt% SnO), enhancing semiconductivity. PL spectra revealed concentration-dependent quenching via PVA–SnO cross-linking, with new defect-mediated emissions at 469/542 nm. Furthermore, the optical dielectric properties showed a rise with the higher SnO content, indicating enhanced polarizability and densification of the nanocomposite films. The nonlinear optical properties, such as χ(3)and n2, also exhibited a significant enhancement with increasing SnO concentration, making these materials promising candidates for use in flexible optoelectronic and nonlinear optical devices.
