This paper investigated 4D supply chain finance system utilizing fractal fractional derivatives with the generalized Mittag-Leffler kernel. The model incorporates key interactions between customer demand, distributor inventory, and retailer orders, creating a dynamic system governed by fractional-order differential equations. We analyze the positiveness and boundedness of the systems solutions. Stability analysis is performed using local asymptotic and global stability criteria, and we further develop linear control strategies employing linear feedback. Additionally, a neural network (ANN) model is employed to predict the system’s future states, including two scenarios of predictions, the first and third future values. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MSE, and MAE metrics. The ANN model demonstrates excellent accuracy, achieving RMSE as low as 0.00011 for the first future value and 0.00029 for the third future value, confirming its robustness in capturing the system’s across varying prediction scenarios. Numerical simulations illustrate the system’s complex dynamics, and the proposed control and prediction methods show significant potential in managing supply chain systems. Understanding the financial system’s long-term behavior, as well as learning about its resilience and crisis potential, are two benefits of fractional order financial model stability analysis. The study shows that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can accurately forecast future states of fractional systems.

Nonlinear dynamic systems, which are deterministic yet display random-like behavior owing to reliance on initial circumstances, have acquired popularity in numerous disciplines such as finance1, engineering2, biology3, astrophysics4, and psychological wellbeing5. Nonlinear interactions between demand, inventory, and order planning also cause chaos in supply chain finance6. Unpredictable and uncontrolled changes can lead to supply chain distortions7. Several research have been conducted to examine the stability and control of chaotic systems in different domains8,9. Linear feedback and adaptive control have been used to stabilize chaotic systems10, resulting in predictable behavior under specific conditions11. Luo et al.12investigated the impact of bullwhips on the supply chain, namely on sales games and customer returns. To regulate the chaotic state, they used the delayed feedback control method in conjunction with entropy and complexity theory. According to the study, the bullwhip effect is significantly influenced by the adjustment speed of constrained reasonable sales expectations, and high return rates have a negative impact on merchant profitability. The bullwhip effect was successfully decreased utilizing the delayed feedback control technique in both quasi-periodic and quasi-chaotic systems. Zhao et al. investigated a dynamic Stackelberg game with duopoly supply chains and a mixed carbon policy13. They investigated the time evolution of the supply chain using a nonlinear discrete dynamical system and a restricted rationality method. Numerical simulations were utilized to validate the findings, which influenced the cost and speed factors. They used a delayed feedback control strategy to decrease chaos while encouraging stable behavior throughout the system. Nav et al.14investigated chaos control strategies in supply chain networks with time-dependent delays between constituent entities. They provide a unique technique to modeling and analyzing chaotic dynamics, as well as a resilient H control methodology for stabilizing the dynamics of the supply chain network. In order to spread improvements fairly and increase network resilience by adding one or two edges, the study15examines the complex supply chain network of the EV industry in China, highlighting the necessity of strategic interactions among high-betweenness nodes. To enhance delivery time prediction in smart logistics systems, Zhu et al.16suggested a hybrid model that combines a fuzzy system and convolutional factorization machine (FSCFM). The model produces more precise projections by combining the inductive characteristics of fuzzy systems, automated data combination of factorization machines, and the local data capture of 1-D convolutional neural networks. The study17reveals that systemic risk varies with time frequency and presents a unique network topology technique that uses the STVAR model to assess the nonlinear impact of market conditions on systemic risk spillovers in commodity markets. Other novel approaches to artificial neural network topology are presented in18–21.

In real-world settings, chaotic time series are crucial for exact prediction22,23. In recent years, machine learning, alongside classical statistical models, has been frequently used in the literature to model and predict chaotic systems24,25. Forecasting these chaotic time series is becoming increasingly dependent on advanced approaches26,27. Sun et al.28demonstrated improved precision in both long and short-term chaos forecasting using the LSTM ED by predicting unpredictable outcomes in nonlinear systems using neural network topologies and a data-driven approach. Dudukcu et al.29proposed a hybrid deep neural network architecture specifically designed for the prediction of chaotic time series. The associated performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed hybrid structure exhibits competitive capabilities when juxtaposed with models documented in contemporary studies regarding chaotic time series prediction. Nasiri and Ebadzadeh30developed a novel multi-functional recurrent fuzzy neural network to forecast time series, combining the advantages of both RNN and FNN. Their findings show that the empirical results support the efficacy of the MFRFNN in successfully forecasting time series data, considerably improving the precision of these forecasts. One of the most pressing concerns is the continued development of a prediction model capable of accurately forecasting chaotic time series.

Fractional differential equations have a lot of potential as an application tool in many domains, but particularly in the applied sciences and engineering31–34. Despite their complex geometry and non-linearity properties, they are becoming increasingly significant in many facets of daily life35–38. Over the past few decades, numerous mathematicians have contributed to this field, making it a valuable resource for tackling real-world problems. Realistic supply chain management systems cannot be well modeled by the initial analytical models used for supply chain system identification, which are based on integer-order differential equations39. Recent breakthroughs in fractional derivative theory40provide a more complete and adaptable framework for defining such a system. Fractional-order models accommodate for supply chain memory and dependencies41. Using the ADM framework, Johansyah et al.42investigate a fractional order SCM model and qualitative aspects using an approach that considers the existence and uniqueness of solutions. They suggested employing Linear Feedback Control to regulate the model. Farman et al.43established a stable economic model for complex fractional-order chaotic systems. It incorporates the required minimum interest rate and uses controllability and detection for feedback control. To overcome the limitations of non-local fractional derivatives, non-integer order derivatives are defined locally. Atangana’s fractal-fractional derivative44is a well-known example of a fractional derivative defined using incremental ratios. This derivative is used to model scientific phenomena involving power laws and scaling. Recent studies45–47have revealed an underlying link between fractional calculus and fractal calculus in geometry. A modification in fractional calculus interpretation can modify the fractal dimension of a function. This work shows how fractal-fractional derivatives, particularly with kernels containing Mittag-Leffler functions, improve these models’ representation of non-local and hereditary features.

Motivated by the above, we investigate a 4-D supply chain finance system utilizing fractal-fractional derivatives and the Mittag-Leffler kernel. We use fractional-order differential equations to describe the relationships of client demand, distributor inventories, and store orders. Given the self-similarity of both natural and artificial systems, fractal-fractional derivatives provide a more precise and adaptable framework for simulating complex systems. The fractal dimension and fractional order of these operators can be changed to better suit the particulars of the system under study. Understanding the long-term behavior of the financial system and learning about its resilience and crisis potential are two advantages of stability analysis of fractional-order financial models. The ability of researchers to recognize stable or unstable environments can help guide risk management plans and policy decisions. Additionally, by capturing intricate dynamics, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can improve the complexity and accuracy of fractional-order financial models. In this aspect, our study is novel and applicable to the study of financial systems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section (2) presents the fundamental ideas and terminology that were applied in the analysis of the model. In Section (3), we extended an existing 4-D financial model using the fractal-fractional operator. The model’s formulation details are given. The key assessment of the suggested mathematical model, including positivity, existence and uniqueness, biological viability, and equilibrium points, is covered in Section (4). In Section (5), we discuss the local and global stability of the model. Additionally, the controlled design of the suggested system is stabilized using the linear feedback regulate method in accordance with its equilibrium; The numerical scheme for the current model under study is presented in Section (6). The problem is discretized using a numerical approach based on Newton polynomial interpolation, which yielded results. Using ANN, a machine learning technique, Section (7) provides a detailed illustration of the prediction steps of the suggested system. The error performance metrics are performed to measure the accuracy of the ANN prediction model. The study’s findings and implications are discussed in Section (8).

Here, we discuss newly developed fractal-fractional derivatives.

whererepresents FF derivative of orderand dimension. The starting state is as follows. whereas Table (1) defines the financial parameters.

We investigate the use of a bounded and positive model in important real-world situations with the goal of proving that, under positive beginning conditions, system (3)’s solutions are positive for all.

50For all, the solutions of the FF finance system (3) with non-negative initial conditions are positive.

51In the positive region, the solutions of the FF finance system (3) are bounded and unique.

Moreover, within any hyperplane enclosing the non-negative space, the vector field necessarily travels in an orientation of. In essence, the entire domainis a favorably invariant set.

When state variables stay constant across time, a system is said to be in equilibrium and will stay there indefinitely. The system listed below needs to be solved in order to determine equilibrium points.

Now we will prove that the kernels in Equation (12) fulfil the Lipschitz and contraction criteria.

In this section, we will use a number of ideas to illustrate the stability of the model (3). First, the proposed model’s local stability properties are examined. The Jacobian matrix is frequently used in local stability analysis of equilibrium locations in dynamical systems. One can determine if little perturbations will increase or decrease, signifying stability or instability, by linearizing the system around an equilibrium point and looking at the Jacobian matrix’s eigenvalues. The system is regarded as stable if every eigenvalue has a negative real part. We used the Volterra-type Lyapunov functions for the global stability study since they are essential in mathematical biology for figuring out the global stability of fractional-order systems. Without directly solving the system’s equations, they offer a methodical way to examine equilibrium points. Using an appropriate Volterra-type Lyapunov function, we proved the global asymptotic stability of equilibrium points, which provided further insight into the long-term behavior of the system (3).

Thus, equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable.

52The equilibrium point,, is globally asymptotically stable if the reproductive number is greater than 1.

According to Lasalle’s invariance idea, the equilibrium point,, is thus globally asymptotically stable if.

Thus,are asymptotically stable equilibrium points since all of the eigenvalues are negative.

After simplification, we finally get the following result.

Comprehensive numerical simulations are used to verify the viability and efficacy of the suggested supply chain network. The results of the previously discussed numerical system, which takes into account the combined influence of fractional and fractal orders, are shown in this section and validate our conclusions. Iteratively, the analysis is conducted by changing the fractional order while keeping the fractal order at 0.1. The process is then repeated with a fixed fractal order of 1. Along with other presumptive parameter values, we employed a variety of parametric values from Table (1). Using initial conditions given below, the FF supply chain system (3) is numerically simulated using the above suggested scheme.

By altering the values ofqand, Figs. (2,3,4,5) demonstrate how altering the FF order impacts the dynamics of various compartments over time. Using sophisticated approaches to produce theoretical findings and evaluate their effectiveness, the study provides a mathematical assessment of a chaotic supply chain framework with a non-linear incidence. According to the analysis, thecompartment shrinks as the fractional order (q) increases, while theincreases. This lowers therate while rising the number of instances of all,, and. The fractional model’s node graphs in Figs. (2a,3a,4a,5a) exhibit strong connections, suggesting a uniform structure with small variances. Long-range corrections are represented by the distance between nodes at fractional orders (q), suggesting a more intricate structure. Figures (2b,3b,4b,5b) illustrate the fractal model’s strong memory effect, as the number of nodes rises with increasing. As a result, the flexible fractional and fractal orders are thought to be better control schemes. Risk assessments and risk management techniques can be improved by having a better understanding of the complex dynamics of financial systems. The complex patterns and behaviors of financial time series, such as long-range dependence and scaling qualities that are typical of financial markets, can be effectively analyzed using the FF finance model. According to the current analysis, FF models are a flexible tool for financial analysis since they can be tailored to various financial systems and situations. A helpful tool for evaluating financial data, forecasting market trends, seeing patterns, and determining how interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation affect stock market performance is the fractal dimension. While all other solutions differ and exhibit the same behavior, the results approach the classical scenario as the fractional order and fractal dimension approach 1. Therefore, fractional and fractal parameters are crucial for control measures.

Chaotic systems are generally difficult to predict due to their long-term unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions. Therefore, using machine learning methods like ANN is a promising way to deal with these issues. This section illustrates the prediction steps of the proposed new chaotic system in detail using an ANN. The prediction is followed by the prediction results and evaluation of the model’s performance through several performance assessment metrics. The aim of this method is to predict the dynamic behaviour of the system over the time by using the ANN. To achieve this, the prediction of the new chaotic system is examined for two scenarios; the prediction of the first future value and the prediction of the third future value. The model is trained using different datasets generated from the proposed fractional-order chaotic system, considering various cases of the parametersqand. The main steps for predicting the proposed new system are demonstrated in Fig.6which outlines each step involved.

The steps of the proposed ANN model for the prediction of the new proposed supply chain chaotic system.

First, MATLAB is used to model the system. In order to train the ANN model for the prediction of the new chaotic system for both the first and third future values, eight datasets are then created. For every scenario, distinct instances ofqandare produced, enabling a thorough assessment of the model’s functionality. Lastly, we use error-based performance indicators like mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to show how accurate the model is.

The creation of datasets for the ANN model’s training is the initial stage in this procedure. The suggested new model is created using Matlab, which enables accurate simulation and modeling of the system’s dynamics and integrates it with ANN tools for ANN model construction and training.

It is crucial to eliminate the impact of the initial conditions’ convergent route, which is not a part of the desired attractor, when creating data. The first 1000 data points from each created dataset are eliminated in order to do this. By doing this, the model will be able to concentrate on the system’s long-term target attractor.

The chaotic behavior of the proposed fractional-order system is controlled by the parametersqand. To examine the prediction of the new chaotic system for both the first future value and the third future value, eight datasets are generated, each representing a distinct case based on different values ofqand. The ANN model is trained separately for each dataset to evaluate its performance under varying chaotic dynamics. For all the cases, the sample time value is set toh= 0.1 to generate 10,000 samples of the four state variables,,, and, which serve as the target outputs of the system.

Once the datasets are generated, they are divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing. This ensures that the model will be evaluated based on unseen data points, which lead to more accurate results to measure the performance of the prediction model.

Finally, the datasets are normalized to ensure that the values are in the same scale. This helps the ANN model converge faster and reduces the likelihood of over-fitting or under-fitting during training.

In this study, for the prediction task of the new supply chain chaotic system, we use feedforward ANN because of its ability to predict the nonlinear relationship between the state variables of the chaotic systems. To predict the state variables of the proposed system, we select a single hidden layer consists of fifteen neurons. A single hidden layer is selected in order to balance computational efficiency and model complexity. Additionally, avoiding the overfitting that can result from adding too many layers. Figure7shows the architecture of the ANN model used in this work consisting of 4 inputs for each state variable,,, and, 15 neurons, and 4 output represent the predicted next output, andfor the first scenario, and,,, andin the second scenario for the prediction of the third future value. Whileandin Fig.7represent the biases and the weights of the neurons that will be adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.

In the training phase, the ANN model learn how to map the input state variables to predict the future values. The model parameters are iteratively updated during the training in order to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values of the state variables. We train the ANN model using Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm to train the generated datasets based on different values ofqandfor the two scenarios. The error criterion is used to train the proposed ANN model.

Figure8demonstrates the results of predicting the first future valuestate variable using the trained ANN model for different cases ofqand. The prediction process of the proposed chaotic system is performed on the testing dataset by using the trained ANN model to obtain the future values of the state variables at the timebased on the previous values of the state variables at time.

The results of using the trained ANN model to predict the third future valuestate variable for variousqandcases are shown in Fig.9. Where the trained ANN model used to determine the third future values of the state variables at timebased on the current state variables at time.

Those three metrics were used to analyze and evaluate the models’ performance, where the lower values indicate better prediction accuracy. Table2presents the error metrics; RMSE, MSE, and MAE for the prediction of the proposed new chaotic system for two scenarios of predictions: the first future value and the third future value. Four different cases each case is characterized by a different value of the parametersqand.

In the prediction of the first future value, case I with,exhibits the lowest error metrics with RMSE=0.00011, MSE=2.332, and MAE= 0.00011. Then, the error metrics increased gradually as the parametersqanddecreased, with Case IV (q= 0.8,= 0.8) showing the largest errors RMSE=0.0.00077, MSE=1.027, and MAE=0.00077.

Similarly in the prediction of the third future value, case Idemonstrates the lowest error across all metrics with RMSE=0.00029, MSE=1.6936, and MAE= 0.00029.

And the lowest performance achieved in Case IV (q= 0.8,= 0.8) showing the largest errors RMSE=0.0010, MSE=2.41, and MAE=0.00102. Which means that the parameter values significantly impact the accuracy of the model, where the better performance was achieved by the higher values of the parametersqand.

Performance evaluation using error metrics for different cases ofqand.

Figure10visualized the values of performance metrics obtained in the testing phase, the bar charts reveals that the parameter values significantly impact the accuracy of the model, where the better performance was achieved by the higher values of the parametersqand. The ANN model demonstrates excellent predictive performance, achieving low error metrics for both the first and third future values, despite the inherent complexity of the chaotic system. These findings highlight the robustness of the ANN model in providing accurate predictions while highlighting how parameter variations affect accuracy.

For the ANN used in this study, Bayesian regularization was selected because it enhances generalization to new data and helps avoid overfitting, particularly when working with complex relationships or sparse data. A more durable and dependable model is made possible by Bayesian regularization, which interprets the network weights as probability distributions in contrast to conventional training methods like backpropagation with preset regularization parameters. Overfitting is a major risk when working with smaller datasets. Bayesian regularization can assist in producing a more dependable model with fewer data points because of its capacity to manage complexity and uncertainty. For many applications, a single hidden layer of 15 neurons is adequate, and it provides a decent trade-off between computing cost and model complexity. More intricate associations can be captured by deeper networks with more layers, but they also come with a higher risk of overfitting and demand more processing power. In theory, single-layer networks can approximate any continuous function and are simpler to learn and comprehend. When working with sequential data, such as time series data, where the order of inputs is important, LSTMs are especially helpful. We trained the model using different datasets generated from the proposed fractional-order system, considering four distinct combinations of the fractal-fractional parametersqand. Overfitting is less likely to occur in single-layer networks with fewer parameters. We normalized the datasets to ensure that the values are in the same scale. This helped the ANN model converge faster and reduced the likelihood of overfitting or underfitting during training. The ANNs-BRTIN system’s various training, validation, and testing success rates show how effectively the model generalizes to new data and how practical it may be. To put it simply, examining the variations in success rates aids in evaluating the model’s capacity for generalization and helps steer clear of problems like overfitting and underfitting, which are critical for figuring out its dependability and usefulness. Future studies should concentrate on examining the effects of various factors as well as alternative deep learning techniques like CNNs and LSTMs.

In this study, we studied the 4-D supply chain finance system using fractal-fractional derivatives with the generalized Mittag-Leffler kernel. Through a detailed analysis of the system’s dynamics, we demonstrated the existence of chaotic behavior under certain parameter conditions. The positiveness and boundedness of the system’s solutions were established, and stability was analyzed through both local asymptotic and global stability criteria. Additionally, we implemented an ANN to predict the future states of the chaotic system, including both the first and third future values. The ANN model’s performance was evaluated using RMSE, MSE, and MAE metrics across multiple cases. The model demonstrated high prediction accuracy, achieving an RMSE as low as 0.00011 for the first future value and 0.00029 for the third future value in the best case (,). The maximum RMSE recorded was 0.00233 for the third future value in the worst case (,). These results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the ANN model in accurately capturing and predicting the chaotic behavior of the system across different prediction scenarios. There are advantages and disadvantages to both fractional and ANN models. The particular issue, the properties of the data, and the required degree of precision and interpretability all influence the model selection. Compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs), fractal-fractional models provides a more resilient and dependable solution in financial systems where non-linear dynamics and long-range dependencies are important. However, ANNs can offer better accuracy for applications involving complicated patterns and large datasets. To show how robust fractional and artificial neural network models are, more research should compare them. Metrics like prediction accuracy, error analysis, and sensitivity to input factors ought to be the main focus of this. It would also be beneficial to investigate how well the models perform in various noise scenarios and how well they generalize to unknown data.
