This study focuses on the prognostic impact of ABO blood type in patients with severe burn injuries, particularly following the Kunshan explosion, exploring an under-investigated area of burn injury outcomes.

Data from patients admitted after the Kunshan explosion were analyzed, using chi-square tests and multivariate Cox regression to investigate the relationship between ABO blood type and overall survival (OS). The study utilized various performance metrics, including the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and Kaplan-Meier survival curve, for model assessment, along with a subgroup analysis for associated factors.

The research identified ABO blood type as an independent prognostic factor in severe burn injuries. It was found that blood type O is associated with better OS, while blood type B is linked to lower OS (p= 0.001). Clinical variables such as acute kidney injury (AKI), sepsis, and other complications influenced the effect of ABO blood type on OS, according to our subgroup analysis.

Our findings indicated that blood type B was an independent and significant predictor of OS in patients with severe burn injuries, likely due to differences in immune and coagulation responses. Although the study focused on the relationship between blood type and OS, it also highlighted the importance of other factors, such as patient comorbidities and treatment approaches.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a burn as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue caused by heat, radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction, or contact with chemicals [1]. Burn injuries cause enduring physical and psychological damage, inflicting significant pain and affecting mental health, life satisfaction, work capacity, and increasing mortality risk. Physical consequences include disfigurement, scarring, impaired mobility, and chronic pain, impacting physical functioning, self-esteem, and body image [2–4]. Global data from the WHO show about 11 million burn injuries annually, with around 180,000 fatalities [1]. Children in low-income countries are at significantly higher risk, with burn-related deaths occurring at rates 7 to 11 times greater than in high-income nations [5,6]. Despite the significant impact, comprehensive research on factors influencing burn prognosis remains limited.

Individuals can be categorized into four primary blood groups (A, B, O, and AB) based on the agglutination patterns of their red blood cells. The ABO blood group system is defined by the presence of A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells and the corresponding antibodies in the serum of individuals lacking these antigens [7,8]. Scientific studies have demonstrated an association between ABO polymorphisms and specific infectious diseases [9–11]. Additionally, research indicates that individuals with non-O blood types, who have elevated levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII (FVIII) in their plasma, are at a higher risk of dementia, cognitive impairments, and cardiovascular diseases [12,13].

Despite extensive scientific research on prognostic factors in severe burn injuries, the potential relationship between the ABO blood group and outcomes after severe burns remains unclear. Several studies have explored the association between ABO blood groups and severe burn injuries; however, few have specifically examined whether these blood groups independently affect overall survival (OS) in this setting.

In our study, we focused on investigating the association between ABO blood type and OS in patients with severe burn injuries following the Kunshan explosion. We hypothesized that ABO blood type serves as a significant prognostic factor in these patients. Specifically, we proposed that certain blood types may be associated with different OS outcomes, potentially informing clinical management strategies to improve patient care. To test this hypothesis, we collected patient information using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and employed various statistical techniques, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC), Kaplan-Meier survival curves, calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and subgroup analyses, to comprehensively evaluate the relationship between ABO blood type and OS. Our findings confirmed our hypothesis and revealed that ABO blood type is an independent prognostic factor: patients with blood type O had higher OS, while those with blood type B had lower OS. These insights can help clinicians optimize care strategies and improve outcomes in severe burn cases. Our research enhances understanding of the impact of ABO blood type on severe burn injuries and underscores the need for further studies in this area.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University (Approval number: CHEC2023-274). As this is a retrospective analysis, the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University waived the requirement for individual patient informed consent. We strictly adhered to confidentiality and privacy protection regulations during data processing to ensure the security of patient information. The Kunshan explosion resulted in 260 casualties. The 75 individuals who died at the scene were excluded from the analysis, leaving 185 injured patients who were promptly transported to 20 hospitals across Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Among these 185 patients, 18 were excluded due to the lack of essential information for our analysis (ABO blood type data), leaving 167 patients for the univariate analysis. For the multivariate analysis, patients with a total body surface area (TBSA) < 70% were further excluded, and 145 patients with TBSA ≥ 70% were included. The remaining patients were then categorized into subgroups based on the variables of interest to address potential confounding. If any patients lacked the necessary variables required for a particular subgroup analysis, their data were excluded from that specific analysis to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the findings.

Burn size was assessed clinically using the "Chinese Rule of Nines," established at the 2004 National Burn Conference in China [14]. This method, widely used in Chinese burn care, estimates body surface area by assigning specific percentages to different body parts, with adjustments for age in pediatric cases. Burn depth was assessed using a combination of clinical evaluation and intraoperative findings. The "Four Degrees and Five Divisions Method," adapted from the 2004 National Burn Surgery Conference, classifies burns from superficial to full-thickness [14]. This method provides detailed insights into burn severity, crucial for treatment decisions and prognosis. During surgery, experienced clinicians validated the depth by observing changes in the wound surface, ensuring accurate classification.

The external validation cohort was derived from burn patients admitted to Changhai Hospital between 2010 and 2020. A total of 5,615 patients were initially identified. Patients with a TBSA of less than 70% (5,459 patients) were excluded. Among the remaining patients, 12 were further excluded due to loss to follow-up or missing data. Ultimately, 144 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the final external validation cohort. This process ensured a rigorous and systematic selection of patients with severe burns for model validation.

A visual analysis of patient data created a heatmap to visualize correlations between variables. A chi-square test was used to identify significant associations between factors. In the derivation model, independent risk factors associated with OS were identified using multivariate Cox regression analysis, which was then performed to create prediction models. These models were subsequently validated using a separate validation cohort. We utilized various metrics to assess the discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability of the models. These metrics included the ROC curve and the AUC, which measure the performance and accuracy of the models. Additionally, we employed the Kaplan-Meier survival curve to evaluate the survival outcomes based on ABO blood type. The calibration plot was used to assess the calibration of the models, ensuring their accuracy and reliability. Lastly, we conducted DCA to evaluate the clinical usefulness and potential benefits of incorporating the ABO blood type in prognostic models for severe burn injuries. After thoroughly comparing the aforementioned findings and considering the regression coefficients, the model that performed the best was chosen to build a forest plot. Finally, subgroup analyses was conducted to identify factors that had statistically significant associations with ABO blood type. A comparative analysis was performed to examine the differences among these factors.

The Kunshan explosion resulted in 260 casualties, with 75 fatalities and 185 injuries. Our study focused on 185 patients treated at nearby hospitals. We performed a univariate analysis on 167 patients to investigate the impact of ABO blood types on OS. We selected 145 patients with burns covering 70% or more of their TBSA for the multivariable analysis to identify mortality risk factors and develop a predictive model (Figure 1). Among them, 106 (57.30%) were aged 19 to 40, and 79 (42.70%) were aged 41 to 60. There were 102 male patients (55.14%) and 83 female patients. Most patients had a TBSA between 96 and 100% (38.38%) and 90–95% (33.51%). All burn injuries were due to fire incidents, with 71.35% having scalp burns, 62.16% perineum burns, 63.78% inguinal region burns, 87.57% neck burns, and 87.57% infraclavicular area burns (Table S1, Figure S1).

Our study indicated that blood type O had the highest survival rate (74.36%), followed by blood type A (58.62%), blood type AB (52.94%), and blood type B had the lowest (43.40%). Additionally, blood type B had the highest mortality rate (56.60%), followed by blood type AB (47.06%), blood type A (41.38%), while blood type O had the lowest mortality rate (25.64%) (Table S2).

Beyond blood type, we also found that most patients (78.38%) experienced complications, including sepsis, organ dysfunction, GI bleeding, GI insufficiency, infectious shock, DIC, acute heart failure (AHF), AKI, acute liver failure (ALF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary infection, and pulmonary edema. Notably, this included high incidences of severe inhalation injuries (80.00%), organ dysfunction (53.51%), and pulmonary complications (50.81%). A high percentage (95.68%) had comorbidities, including inhalation injury, blast injury, fractures, and visceral injuries. It is worth noting that a portion of patients did not present with complications or comorbidities, such as GI bleeding (90.75%), GI insufficiency (93.04%), infectious shock (58.38%), DIC (88.65%), ARDS(60.00%), AKI (69.73%), and AHF (56.76%). Additionally, timely interventions, such as deep vein catheterization before admission (47.40%) or during treatment (91.12%), ventilator assistance (86.49%), and tracheotomy (89.02%), may impact the OS.

We performed univariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival curves to assess the impact of ABO blood types on OS. The analysis revealed that individuals with blood type O had the highest OS, while those with blood type B had the lowest OS, as depicted in the graph (p= 0.001) (Figure 2A).

(A) The Kaplan-Meier survival curves are used to evaluate how ABO blood types affect a patient’s prognosis. According to the data, blood type O had the highest OS, whereas blood type B had the lowest OS, as seen in the graph (p = 0.001). At 240 days, the survival rates were 33.33% for blood type O, 23.53% for blood type AB, 22.41% for blood type A, and 15.09% for blood type B.

(B) The forest plot of the multivariable model depicts the relationships and effects of multiple factors. It provides a visual representation of the regression coefficients, confidence intervals, and statistical significance for each factor included in the model. The forest plot allows for a comprehensive assessment of the combined impact of these factors on the outcome of interest.

(C) The net benefit of OS predictions at 2 weeks (blue), 4 weeks (red), and 8 weeks (yellow) is shown across a range of threshold probabilities, compared to the “Treat None” (black) and “Treat All” (green) strategies. The curves demonstrate the clinical utility of the model at lower threshold probabilities.

(D) The calibration curve evaluates the model’s predictive ability and calibration by comparing predicted survival rates (nomogram-predicted OS) with observed survival rates (observed OS). The model’s good calibration aligns with the diagonal line, indicating accurate estimation of survival probability.

(E) The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the predictive model exhibited moderate predictive discrimination capabilities, which means that the model was able to effectively differentiate between the positive and negative outcomes, indicating its potential to accurately predict the occurrence of the desired event (AUC at 2 weeks: 0.681, AUC at 4 weeks: 0.732, AUC at 8 weeks: 0.686, AUC at 12 weeks: 0.692).

A forest plot for multivariable cox regression analysis was created, incorporating four variables. The analysis revealed that the percentage of third- and fourth-degree burns was identified as an independent prognostic factor, significantly influencing the risk or likelihood of patients experiencing the outcome event (HR = 75.19, 95% CI = 5.71–989.77,p< 0.001). Additionally, patients with blood type B (ABO blood type B) demonstrated a higher probability of experiencing the outcome event compared to individuals with other blood types (HR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.27–5.43,p= 0.009) (Figure 2B).

The DCA results indicated that at lower threshold probabilities, the OS prediction curves for each time point demonstrate a certain level of net benefit, indicating that the model may have potential clinical utility within these lower threshold ranges (Figure 2C). The calibration curve showed good alignment with the diagonal line, indicating accurate estimation and good calibration of survival probabilities (Figure 2D). The ROC curve analysis revealed moderate predictive discrimination (AUC at 2 weeks: 0.681, 4 weeks: 0.732, 8 weeks: 0.686, 12 weeks: 0.692) (Figure 2E). Additional assessments using residual plots, risk score diagnostic plots, survival curves for high-risk and low-risk groups, and Schoenfeld residual plots confirmed the model’s robust performance (Figure S2A-F).

Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed distinct survival rates among blood types within age groups. In the 19–40 age group, blood type B had lower OS, while blood type O had higher OS (p= 0.002) (Figure 3A). In the 41–60 age group, blood type B had the lowest OS, and blood type O had the highest OS (p= 0.013) (Figure 3B). This pattern was consistent for both genders. Among males, blood type B had lower OS and blood type O had higher OS (p< 0.001) (Figure 3C). Among females, blood type B had the lowest OS, while blood type O was associated with the highest OS (p< 0.001) (Figure 3D).

(A) The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to compare the OS among patients of different blood types within the age group of 19 to 40 years, revealing survival percentages of 24.24% for blood type A, 23.33% for blood type B, 40.00% for blood type AB, and 27.27% for blood type O.

(B) The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to compare the OS among patients of different blood types, showing that for patients aged 41 to 60 years with severe burn injuries, the survival percentages were as follows: blood type A (4.76%), blood type B (4.35%), blood type AB (0.00%), and blood type O (41.18%).

(C) The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to compare the OS among male patients of different blood types, with the survival percentage for males being 27.45%.

(D) The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to compare the OS among female patients of different blood types, with the survival percentage for females being 22.89%.

We conducted a Pearson’s chi-square test to analyze the association between AKI and ABO blood types in burn patients, revealing a statistically significant association (p= 0.02) (Figure 3E). The highest percentage of AKI was observed in blood type AB (53%), followed by blood type B (40%), blood type A(26%), and the lowest in blood type O (18%). Meanwhile, a Pearson’s chi-square test showed a significant association between sepsis and ABO blood types (p= 0.01) (Figure 3F), with blood type AB showing the highest percentage (82%), followed by blood type A (78%), blood type B (66%), and the lowest in blood type O (49%). Further analysis indicated a statistically significant and weak association between ABO blood type and complications (p< 0.05) (Figure 3G), with blood type A having the highest percentage of complications (91%), followed by blood type AB (82%), blood type B (77%), and the lowest in blood type O (69%). There was also an association between ABO blood type and stamp skin (p= 0.0057) (Figure 3H), with the highest percentage in blood type A (78%), followed by blood type AB (53%) and blood type O (51%), and the lowest in blood type B (47%). For infectious shock, no statistically significant relationship with ABO blood type was observed (p= 0.05) (Figure 3I). Also, in the Pearson’s chi-square test, we observed that some factors did not show significant statistical differences among patients with different ABO blood types (Figure S3–S6). In summary, while there was a weak association between ABO blood type and complications, a moderate association was observed with the use of stamp skin grafting. Further research is needed to explore these relationships in depth.

Further, we utilized a separate sample for external validation to assess the impact of ABO blood types on OS. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in OS among ABO blood types, with type B displaying the lowest OS (p= 0.018,Figure 4A). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis (Figure 4B), key predictors of OS included age, gender, burn severity, and ABO blood type. Patients in the 61–92 age group exhibited a significantly elevated risk (HR = 12.05,p< 0.001), and males had a higher risk than females (HR = 2.47,p= 0.009). Additionally, a higher percentage of third- and fourth-degree burns was a strong predictor of poor prognosis (HR = 47.14,p< 0.001), while blood type B was linked to an increased risk compared to other blood types (HR = 2.36,p= 0.017). The DCA results inFigure 4Cdemonstrated that, at lower threshold probabilities, each OS prediction curve (2-week, 4-week, and 8-week) showed some level of net benefit compared to the “Treat None” and “Treat All” strategies. The calibration plot (Figure 4D) showed that the predicted OS probabilities at 1-week, 4-week, 8-week, and 12-week intervals aligned closely with the observed OS, as indicated by the curves near the ideal diagonal line. The ROC curves inFigure 4Edisplayed the model’s discriminatory ability at different time intervals, with the AUC values indicating good predictive accuracy. The AUC values were as follows: 0.834 at 2 weeks, 0.878 at 4 weeks, 0.842 at 8 weeks, and 0.823 at 12 weeks.Figure 5summarizes the findings and conclusions based on the study.

The graph summarizing the findings and conclusions based on the study.

Burn injuries pose a significant global public health challenge due to their widespread occurrence and profound consequences on individuals, families, and societies, encompassing physical, psychological, and economic aspects [19,20]. Annually, fire-related burns account for approximately 265,000 fatalities worldwide [21]. These injuries can lead to long-lasting physical disabilities, significant psychological distress, and substantial economic burdens due to extensive medical care, rehabilitation, and long-term support [2,22,23]. ABO blood types are derived from genetic variations controlling oligosaccharide molecules on H antigens [24]. These polymorphisms are associated with specific infectious diseases and immune responses [7,8]. Despite extensive research on prognostic factors for severe burn injuries, the relationship between ABO blood type and severe burn outcomes has not been fully explored. Few studies have specifically investigated whether ABO blood type influences the OS of individuals with severe burn injuries. Understanding the role of ABO blood type as a prognostic factor could provide valuable insights and improve patient OS. Therefore, further research in this area is required to determine whether ABO blood type should be considered when tailoring treatment strategies for severe burn patients.

This study examined the relationship between ABO blood type and severe burn injuries, hypothesizing that ABO blood type is an independent prognostic factor. The results confirmed this hypothesis, with blood type B having the lowest OS and blood type O having the highest OS. Age and gender did not significantly impact this association. In the confounding factor analysis, we found that blood types A and O were linked to a lower risk of AKI. Also, there was a significant variation in sepsis incidence among different ABO blood types. Chi-square analysis indicated relationships between ABO blood type and complications, skin graft. These findings highlight the potential influence of ABO blood type on health outcomes and warrant further investigation to better understand the nature and implications of these associations.

However, our analysis found no significant associations between ABO blood types and factors such as hemolysis, deep vein catheterization, ventilator assistance, plasma transfusion, or red blood cell transfusion. Previous studies support these findings, showing no significant differences in blood transfusion volume, recurrent bleeding rates, or mortality between blood type O and non-type O patients [25]. The multifactorial nature of severe burn injuries, including burn extent, patient comorbidities, and treatment interventions, likely overshadows the impact of ABO blood type. [1]. Additionally, genetic, immunological, and environmental factors interacting with ABO blood type may influence outcomes.

Previous studies have investigated the relationship between ABO blood type and acute kidney injury and sepsis, with some suggesting that patients with blood type A have the poorest prognosis [21,22]. Consistent with our study findings, both studies suggest that blood type is a factor that influences the prognosis of patients with acute trauma. Patients with non-O blood types typically have a poorer prognosis, while those with blood type O often have a better prognosis. Regarding sepsis, ABO antigens play a crucial role in immune responses against infections. Specific antigens and antibodies influence defense mechanisms, with A/B antigens and anti-A/B antibodies being significant [26]. Studies have reported a higher frequency of HTLV-1 infection, cervical cancer, and pulmonary tuberculosis among individuals with blood type AB [27–29]. Furthermore, there have been reports suggesting a higher prevalence of blood type B among patients with HBV infection, although the correlation between HBV infection and blood type is not significant [30]. Furthermore, there have been reports suggesting blood type B is associated with resistance-specific infections [31]. The observed associations between ABO blood types and sepsis outcomes in severe burn injury patients may be attributed to variations in immune responses and susceptibility to infections among different blood types.

Furthermore, many existing studies support our scientific conclusion. Multiple studies have shown that individuals with non-O blood group status have higher levels of FVIII and von Willebrand factor, which are important factors in the coagulation process [32,33]. This elevation in coagulation factors may contribute to an increased risk of coagulation and thrombotic events in individuals with non-O blood types. Additionally, studies have indicated a significant correlation between VWF/FVIII levels, the ABO (H) blood group, and various cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, individuals with non-O blood types have a higher risk of developing conditions such as myocardial infarction, angina, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral ischemic attack, and venous thromboembolism compared to those with blood type O [9,34–38]. In our study of severe burn injuries, we did not find a significant association between ABO blood type and the occurrence of DIC or ARDS. This contrasts with a 2014 study from Northern Italy that reported an association between blood type A and ARDS [39], although their patients had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from various causes, introducing potential confounding factors. Our findings suggest that ABO blood type may not directly influence the development of ARDS in severe burn patients. Simultaneously, studies on inflammatory mediators and cytokines have shown that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels are significantly higher in individuals with blood types A, B, and AB [40,41]. In fact, in non-O blood types, only three cytokines (HGF, MCP1, and IL-18) maintain consistently elevated levels during hospitalisation, which are associated with adverse outcomes [42].

Numerous studies have suggested a link between ABO blood types and personality traits, which may influence prognoses among individuals with different blood types [43,44]. Personality traits such as neuroticism, extraversion, optimism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness could affect how patients handle the challenges of severe injuries. For instance, individuals with blood type B, associated with higher neuroticism, may experience greater emotional distress and struggle with coping mechanisms after severe burn injuries, leading to increased anxiety and difficulty managing pain and trauma [45]. Conversely, those with blood type O, characterized by extraversion and optimism, may show more resilience and a positive outlook during recovery, benefiting from better social support. Individuals with blood type A, known for higher agreeableness, might be more cooperative and patient with medical treatment and rehabilitation, aiding smoother recovery. Those with blood type AB, linked to higher conscientiousness, may adhere more diligently to treatment plans, positively impacting recovery outcomes [43,44,46]. These psychological factors, in conjunction with medical interventions and social support, could significantly influence the recovery journey and overall prognosis of individuals with severe burn injuries.

This study highlights that all patients received full support from the national healthcare system, ensuring necessary blood transfusions regardless of blood type. However, in routine clinical practice, blood resource availability is limited. Each blood transfusion requires a formal request from the attending physician and approval from the blood bank to manage the scarce supply. Blood bank inventories are often unbalanced. O-type blood, being a universal donor, is in high demand and used more frequently, while AB-type blood is reserved for specific cases, leading to lower stock levels. Consequently, the availability of different blood types varies. Despite conducting this study with an unrestricted patient cohort, the real-world application may differ due to these resource constraints. Therefore, if the outcomes in practical settings differ from those observed in our study, it is crucial to consider the impact of resource limitations as a potential contributing factor to any discrepancies.

This study offers valuable insights into the relationship between ABO blood type and severe burn injury prognosis but has several limitations. The findings, which were conducted in China and focused on patients from the Kunshan explosion, may therefore be more applicable to the Chinese population and not generalizable to other countries or regions with different healthcare systems, demographics, or cultural backgrounds. Also, the study primarily involved a specific ethnic group, limiting the exploration of different ethnicities’ influence on the prognosis. Another limitation is the difficulty in attributing exact causes of death to specific factors due to the interconnected nature of infection and multi-organ dysfunction. Despite these limitations, the study is significant as it presents preliminary evidence linking ABO blood type with burn injury prognosis. This information can guide individualized clinical decisions and treatment planning. Future research should involve larger, more diverse populations and multi-center studies to enhance the generalizability of findings. Further investigations could explore ABO blood type’s relationship with inflammatory markers, immune function, treatment response, and complication rates to improve clinical management and patient outcomes.

Our study shows that blood type B is an independent prognostic factor in extensive burn injuries, with patients experiencing lower OS compared to other blood types. This may be due to variations in immune response, coagulation factors, and infection susceptibility. The severity of burn injuries, complications, and treatment interventions may also influence these results. These findings underscore the importance of considering ABO blood type in predicting prognosis and guiding clinical decisions for burn patients.
