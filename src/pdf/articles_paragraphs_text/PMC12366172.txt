I recently read this article, and there are some remarks to be noted.

Abstract: The authors present the study as a "retrospective" study, while they present it as a prospective one in the text.

The authors report their technique as a new one, while it has been described a very long time ago [1]. In addition, more advanced techniques for accurate localization of the sentinel node mapped by CT lymphography (CTLG) have also been described [2].

Performing ALND for 78 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can never be accepted and is totally against the breast cancer management guidelines [4].

More importantly, the authors mentioned that they had operated on 78 patients with DCIS, which is considered stage 0 breast cancer [4], while in the "stage" item, they mentioned that they had operated on patients with stages I and II only. This raises many concerns about the credibility of the numbers.

The authors did not explain how they could use the 3D models for performing the skin mark. It seems that they depended on the "imagination" of its site based on the 3D model, which may not be enough. In addition, the skin mark can be simply made using the laser pointer of the CT machine while performing the CTLG procedure [2].

In addition, performing endoscopic lymph node dissection for 389 patients, with only one patient who developed lymphedema, and no patients suffering from sensory complications or pain, is not coping with any of the published literature [6].

The non-accepted unnecessary ALND was performed for the patients included in the study, even for those with DCIS.

Losing credibility in the number of breast cancer stages of the included patients.

The number of complications and the patients who had positive axillary nodes after positive SLNB are discordant with the published literature.
