Managing chronic illness effectively depends not only on treatment availability but also on patients’ ability to adhere to prescribed medications.

This study examined the factors influencing medication adherence among Jordanian adults with long-term conditions, using both traditional regression and machine learning methods.

In this cross-sectional study, patients with chronic conditions completed an online survey that assessed demographic, clinical and behavioural variables, including Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ-12) and adherence (MARS-5). Quantile regression and machine learning models were applied.

A total of 981 patients (63.1% females) were enrolled in the study. Quantile regression showed that higher health literacy, a diagnosis of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, and fewer prescribed medications were positively associated with adherence. In contrast, being married or having public, military or no insurance was linked to lower adherence scores. The Random Forest model achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2= 0.38), and SHAP analysis identified health literacy, disease duration and age as the most influential features.

These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions that address both individual understanding and structural challenges, such as insurance type and treatment complexity. Improving health literacy, simplifying medication regimens, and ensuring equitable healthcare access may help support better adherence in this population. The use of explainable machine learning, alongside conventional statistical approaches, offers new opportunities to improve the understanding and prediction of adherence behaviours in resource-constrained settings.

Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory illnesses, are among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, accounting for more than half of all global mortality [1]. In Jordan, their impact is even more pronounced, with recent estimates attributing over three-quarters of all deaths to non-communicable diseases [2]. These long-term, typically incurable conditions pose a persistent challenge for both individuals and healthcare systems. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention defines chronic diseases as those lasting at least one year and requiring ongoing medical care or limiting daily activities [3]. Managing these illnesses places increasing strain on public health infrastructure and demands more than pharmacological treatment. It requires a nuanced understanding of the behavioural, social and emotional factors that shape how individuals engage with their care [4,5].

Among the many challenges to effective chronic disease management, poor adherence to treatment is particularly concerning. It is estimated that up to 40% of patients fail to follow medical advice correctly, whether due to forgetfulness, misunderstanding or deliberate noncompliance [6]. The World Health Organization defines medication adherence as the extent to which a person’s behaviour aligns with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider [7]. Achieving optimal adherence depends not only on healthcare delivery but also on patients’ understanding of their illness, trust in treatment and ability to manage emotional, practical and financial barriers [8]. This has led to growing interest in individual-level factors that influence adherence, particularly health literacy, defined as the ability to access, understand, evaluate and apply health information effectively [9,10].

Low health literacy has been consistently linked to poorer adherence and worse outcomes across a range of chronic conditions. In response, validated tools have been developed to measure both adherence and health literacy with increasing precision. The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) is widely used as a self-report tool that distinguishes between intentional and unintentional nonadherence while being quick to administer [11,12]. A licence to use the MARS-5 was obtained from the original developers, and the validated Arabic version developed by one of the co-authors of this study was employed in this study. Similarly, the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ-12), which has been culturally adapted and validated for Arabic-speaking populations, assesses patients’ perceived ability to engage with health-related information across clinical care, prevention and health promotion contexts [13,14]. While these tools provide valuable insight, the interaction between health literacy, adherence and other patient-level factors remains underexplored in specific sociocultural contexts such as Jordan.

To address this gap, this study applies machine learning techniques to model and predict medication adherence among Jordanian adults living with chronic illnesses. Unlike traditional regression approaches, which estimate linear relationships and significance levels, machine learning algorithms can detect complex, nonlinear interactions between variables and improve predictive accuracy. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is employed to enhance interpretability, identifying the most influential predictors and illustrating the direction and strength of their contributions to adherence behaviour [15]. Key variables examined include health literacy, disease duration, age and clinical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The aim of this study was twofold: first, to assess levels of medication adherence and health literacy among Jordanian adults with chronic conditions; and second, to develop and interpret predictive models that clarify the demographic and clinical factors influencing adherence, using both traditional and machine learning methods. The findings aim to deepen understanding of how individual-level characteristics shape treatment engagement and inform more responsive and equitable chronic disease management strategies in Jordan and similar settings.

This study employed a cross-sectional design focusing on adult patients. Data were collected between September 2024 and April 2025.

Participants were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria [1]: Jordanian nationality [2], aged 18 years or older and [3] diagnosed with at least one chronic condition lasting more than 12 months. Individuals were excluded if they did not consent to participants.

Participants were recruited using a non-probability convenience sampling method. The online survey link was distributedviasocial media platforms (e.g. Facebook and WhatsApp groups), community health forums and through healthcare facilities and community centres across Jordan. This mixed-channel approach aimed to increase geographic and demographic reach while maintaining feasibility during the study period.

At the beginning of the questionnaire, participants were asked to complete a demographic section that included questions on age, place of residence, nationality and long-term health conditions to confirm eligibility. Written informed consent was required before participants could proceed with the survey.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board and the Deanship of Research at Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (Reference No.: 2025-2024/07/42). The study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The questionnaire consisted of two sections. The first section collected demographic data, including age, sex, place of residence, nationality and type of long-term condition. The second section included two validated measurement tools. The first was the MARS-5 [16], a five-item self-report questionnaire that assesses behaviours related to medication nonadherence, such as stopping treatment, skipping doses, or altering the prescribed dosage [17]. A licence to use the MARS-5 was obtained from the original developers, and the validated Arabic version developed by one of the co-authors of this study (WQ) was employed in this study. On the scale, each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Always) to 5 (Never), yielding a total score between 5 and 25, with higher scores indicating better adherence [18].

The second instrument was the Arabic version of the HLQ-12 [13], a widely used and validated tool for assessing health literacy in various cultural and clinical settings [14]. The HLQ-12 consists of 12 items designed to evaluate participants’ perceived ease or difficulty in accessing, understanding, evaluating and applying health information in three domains: medical care, disease prevention and health promotion [19]. Items are rated on a four-point Likert scale from 1 (Very difficult) to 4 (Very easy), with higher scores reflecting better health literacy.

All analyses were conducted using R software version 4.5.0 (Vienna, Austria). After data cleaning, the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets: a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%), using stratified sampling to maintain the distribution of outcome variables. Continuous variables were standardized in linear models to support interpretability and model convergence. Categorical variables were encoded using indicator (dummy) variables to preserve their original structure without imposing an artificial order.

The main outcome measures were MARS-5 and HLQ-12 scores, which were used to train several machine learning models. These included Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial kernel, k-nearest neighbours (kNN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost, Decision Tree and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). All models were trained using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. Model performance was evaluated based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). Generalizability was assessed by applying the models to the testing set for external validation.

To better understand model behaviour, SHAP values were calculated using the full training dataset. SHAP analysis provided insight into which features contributed most to the predictions and in what direction. Both the mean absolute values and the signed SHAP values were included to reflect the importance of each feature and how it influenced the predicted outcomes.

Table 1presents the demographic characteristics of participants in the training (n= 786) and validation (n= 195) datasets. The median age was 41 years in the training set and 40 years in the validation set. In both groups, the median number of medications used was two. Most participants were female (64.4% in the training set and 57.9% in the validation set), and the majority had completed a college or university degree. The most common income category in both groups was less than 500 Jordanian Dinars (JD) per month. In terms of health conditions, diabetes and cardiovascular disease were the most frequently reported chronic illnesses across both datasets.

Several machine learning models were developed to predict adherence scores based on demographic and clinical variables (seeTable 2). The models evaluated included Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Elastic Net and KNN. Model performance was assessed using RMSE, MAE and the coefficient of determination (R2). Among the models tested, Random Forest showed the best initial performance, with an RMSE of 4.284, an MAE of 3.350 and anR2of 0.347.

Machine learning model performance for adherence prediction.

To enhance predictive accuracy, hyperparameter tuning was conducted for the Random Forest model by adjusting the number of predictors randomly sampled at each split (mtry) using five-fold cross-validation. The tuned model yielded improved results, with a lower RMSE of 4.195 and a higherR2of 0.380, while the MAE remained comparable at 3.369. These findings support the Random Forest algorithm as the most effective model for predicting adherence in this dataset, offering strong performance and a reasonable explanation of variance.

SHAP analysis of the tuned Random Forest model identified the most influential predictors of adherence scores (Figure 1). Health literacy emerged as the strongest contributor, with the highest mean absolute SHAP value by a substantial margin. Disease duration and age were also important, suggesting that longer illness history and older age were associated with variations in adherence. Additional factors, such as cardiovascular disease status, number of medications, insurance type and marital status contributed moderately to the predictions. Clinical variables including diabetes, other chronic conditions and employment in the health sector had smaller but still meaningful impacts. In contrast, conditions such as asthma, bipolar disorder, osteoarthritis, cancer and COPD had minimal influence on adherence outcomes. Overall, the SHAP findings highlight the central role of health literacy and chronic disease experience in shaping adherence behaviours, consistent with clinical expectations.

The directional SHAP (beeswarm) analysis of the tuned Random Forest model provides insight into both the magnitude and direction of each feature’s contribution to predicted adherence scores (Figure 2). Health literacy and disease duration were the most influential variables, with higher values consistently linked to increased predicted adherence. The colour gradient shows that lighter hues, representing higher health literacy scores, are associated with positive contributions, while darker shades indicate a negative impact from lower scores. Age also had a moderate influence, with younger individuals generally showing lower predicted adherence. Additional predictors, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and number of medications, showed meaningful contributions, often associated with decreased adherence. In contrast, variables, such as osteoarthritis, cancer and sex had minimal impact, as indicated by SHAP values clustered near zero. Overall, the beeswarm plot emphasizes the prominent role of health literacy and chronic disease burden, while also illustrating more subtle individual-level effects across other demographic and clinical factors.

Directional SHAP analysis of the tuned random Forest model.

Quantile regression analysis identified several significant predictors of adherence at the median quantile (seeTable 3). Health literacy was the strongest positive predictor (β= 0.40,p< 0.001), with a narrow 95% confidence interval (0.35–0.46), reinforcing its central role in supporting adherence. Clinical conditions such as diabetes (β= 2.32,p< 0.001) and cardiovascular disease (β= 3.09,p< 0.001) were also positively associated with higher adherence scores. In contrast, being married (β= −1.17,p= 0.006), having public insurance (β= −1.05,p= 0.036), military insurance (β= −1.63,p= 0.001) or no insurance (β= −1.51,p= 0.002) were each linked to lower adherence when compared to private insurance. Additionally, a higher number of medications was negatively associated with adherence (β= −0.38,p= 0.002), suggesting that polypharmacy may present a barrier to consistent treatment behaviour.

Quantile regression results showing variables significantly associated with medication adherence.

This study explored predictors of medication adherence among Jordanian adults living with chronic conditions, using both quantile regression and machine learning models. Across both analytical approaches, health literacy emerged as the strongest predictor of adherence, aligning with a growing body of research that positions health literacy as a foundational component of treatment engagement [8, 9]. These findings are particularly significant in the Jordanian context, where chronic disease prevalence is high and healthcare navigation can be complex [20].

The strong relationship between health literacy and adherence is consistent with earlier studies conducted in both high- and middle-income countries. For example, Vermeire et al. and Nguyen et al. [7,10] found that individuals with higher health literacy were better able to understand treatment plans, anticipate side effects and communicate effectively with healthcare providers, all of which support improved adherence. Our findings build on these by demonstrating that health literacy is not only statistically significant but also the most influential variable in predictive modelling, as evidenced by the SHAP analysis.

Clinical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease were also associated with better adherence. This may reflect the more structured care pathways and frequent provider interactions that often accompany these diagnoses [6]. It is also possible that the perceived severity of these illnesses prompts greater patient vigilance. This is consistent with findings from the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation, which suggests that individuals who view their condition as more serious are more likely to adhere to treatment recommendations [21]. Empirical studies have also shown that stronger illness perceptions, particularly regarding severity and consequences, are associated with better medication adherence across a range of chronic conditions [22]. Interestingly, these conditions were among the top contributors in both regression and machine learning models, suggesting a robust and stable association across methods.

In contrast, polypharmacy was negatively associated with adherence, a finding that aligns with prior studies demonstrating that managing multiple medications can reduce adherence through both cognitive and practical challenges. Tommelein et al. reported that patients using several medications often struggle with remembering dosages, timing and administration instructions, which can lead to both intentional and unintentional nonadherence [17]. This has been echoed in broader systematic reviews, which highlight the cumulative effect of regimen complexity, side effects and patient fatigue [23,24]. Additionally, polypharmacy has been linked to a lower perception of treatment necessity and higher concern about adverse effects, both of which are key components in adherence behaviour according to the Necessity-Concerns Framework [25]. These findings highlight the need for regular medication reviews, these findings underscore the need for regular medication reviews, particularly in primary care, where deprescribing or simplifying treatment plans may improve adherence and reduce patient burden [24,26]. Clinical pharmacists can play a critical role in supporting these efforts, ensuring that treatment regimens are both clinically necessary and manageable from the patient’s perspective.

Another notable finding was the inverse association between medication adherence and certain types of insurance coverage. Participants with public, military or no insurance reported lower adherence compared to those with private insurance. While this pattern may partly reflect differences in healthcare access, it likely also captures broader systemic issues, such as quality of care, patient–provider communication and continuity of treatment. Prior research has shown that individuals with private insurance tend to experience shorter wait times, greater provider choice and more consistent follow-up care, all of which are associated with better treatment adherence [27]. In contrast, public insurance systems often involve fragmented care pathways and resource constraints, which can lead to diminished patient engagement, less personalized care and lower trust in medical advice [28]. Military insurance may introduce additional complications, such as frequent provider turnover or administrative hurdles that affect continuity and convenience of care.

Moreover, insurance type can serve as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Individuals with public or no insurance are more likely to experience financial hardship, which has been linked to reduced medication adherence due to cost-related nonadherence, such as skipping doses or delaying prescription refills [29]. Even when medications are nominally covered, indirect costs, such as transport, time off work or caregiving responsibilities, can pose significant barriers. These findings highlight the importance of addressing not only health literacy and clinical complexity but also the structural and financial obstacles that undermine adherence, particularly for vulnerable groups. In the Jordanian context, where public sector healthcare is often overstretched and private care remains unaffordable for many [30], targeted policies are needed to ensure equitable access and support for medication management across insurance types.

Interestingly, being married was also associated with lower adherence, a finding that contrasts with studies from Western contexts where marital status is often associated with better health behaviours due to spousal support [7,31] However, this result may reflect distinct sociocultural dynamics within the Jordanian context, where the family, not the individual, is the basic social unit [32]. Our study sample was predominantly female (63.1%) with a median age of 41 years, a demographic that often shoulders significant caregiving responsibilities for children, spouses and aging parents [33]. It is plausible that for married individuals, especially women, in this setting, family obligations and the associated mental, physical and time burdens may supersede the demands of their own self-care, leading to unintentional non-adherence [34]. Rather than acting as a source of support for the patient’s chronic condition, the family unit may introduce competing priorities and stressors that hinder consistent medication-taking behaviour [35]. This stresses the importance of understanding the social and emotional factors that shape health engagement [36]. Therefore, this finding highlights a critical area for future research, as ignoring the social and cultural context of adherence is likely to result in ineffective interventions [36]. Qualitative studies are needed to explore the complex household dynamics, role responsibilities and intrafamilial support systems that may explain why marriage appears to be a risk factor for lower medication adherence in this population, as these methods can reveal how interpersonal relationships serve as both barriers and facilitators to self-care [37].

The machine learning models, particularly the tuned Random Forest model, outperformed traditional regression in predictive accuracy and revealed additional important features such as age and disease duration. Although these variables were not statistically significant in the regression model, their consistent importance in the SHAP analysis highlights the value of machine learning in capturing complex, nonlinear associations [38]. This dual-method approach allows for both interpretability and predictive power and should be considered more broadly in adherence research.

A key strength of this study lies in its use of both traditional regression and machine learning approaches to examine predictors of medication adherence. This dual-method strategy provided complementary insights. Regression analysis produced interpretable effect estimates, while machine learning, supported by SHAP analysis, uncovered complex and nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcomes [38]. The use of culturally validated instruments adds further rigor and ensures the tools were appropriate for an Arabic-speaking population. Importantly, the study offers data from Jordan, where evidence on adherence behaviours remains limited despite the high burden of chronic illness.

Several limitations should also be considered. The cross-sectional design prevents any conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships. The reliance on self-reported measures may have introduced recall errors or social desirability bias, particularly for questions related to medication-taking behaviour. Additionally, all clinical information, including diagnoses, number of medications, and disease duration, was reported by patients without medical record verification. This introduces potential misclassification or reporting inaccuracies Furthermore, since data were collected online, individuals with limited access to technology or low digital literacy, particularly older adults, may have been underrepresented. This may help explain the relatively low median age of the sample and limit the generalizability of findings to elderly populations. While the sample age distribution reflects the demographic structure of Jordan, where the median age is approximately 22.9 years and only around 3.7% of the population is aged 65 or older [39], the issue of adherence in older adults remains clinically important due to their higher likelihood of polypharmacy, cognitive decline and functional limitations [40]. Future research should employ targeted recruitment strategies to better capture the experiences of elderly patients, who may face distinct barriers to adherence.

Furthermore, future work should prioritize longitudinal research designs to track how predictors of adherence change over time and to assess the long-term impact of interventions. Incorporating objective adherence measures, such as electronic monitoring, pharmacy refill records or clinical biomarkers, would strengthen validity and reduce reliance on self-report. Qualitative research could help explain some of the more surprising findings, such as the association between lower adherence and being married or having public or military insurance. These patterns may reflect household dynamics, role responsibilities or systemic challenges that are not captured through quantitative methods alone.

In addition, future work should explore and test targeted interventions aimed at improving modifiable factors such as health literacy and treatment complexity. Mixed-methods designs may be especially useful for evaluating the outcomes of such interventions, as well as their acceptability to patients and feasibility in clinical practice. Finally, the use of machine learning models in this study highlights the potential of explainable artificial intelligence to enhance understanding of adherence behaviours. These techniques could be used not only to improve prediction, but also to support personalized strategies for medication management in clinical settings.

This study offers strong evidence that health literacy plays a key role in supporting medication adherence among Jordanian adults living with chronic conditions. By combining traditional regression with explainable machine learning methods, the analysis uncovered both statistically significant predictors and more complex relationships that would have been missed using conventional approaches alone. Health literacy, disease duration, specific clinical diagnoses, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and insurance status all emerged as important factors influencing adherence.

These findings suggest that efforts to improve adherence need to address more than just patient knowledge. Simplifying medication regimens, improving access to care and supporting individuals with limited financial resources or less stable insurance coverage may help reduce barriers to consistent medication use. Interventions should be tailored to the local healthcare context, taking into account the social and structural factors that shape patients’ ability to follow treatment recommendations.

As the burden of chronic disease continues to rise in Jordan and similar settings, future research should explore how these factors change over time and whether targeted interventions can improve long-term adherence. Using machine learning to support this work may help health systems move toward more personalized and responsive care.
