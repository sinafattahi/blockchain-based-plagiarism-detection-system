Deficiency of the phospholipid transporter ATP8B1 causes infantile‐onset progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type I (PFIC1). Pre‐transplant PFIC1 patients often present with mild dyslipidaemia. This raises the possibility that PFIC1 patients, besides cholestasis, may also experience defects in glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of ATP8B1 in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using theAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmutant mouse, a pre‐clinical model of PFIC1.

Atp8b1G308V/G308Vand wild‐type mice on normal chow were examined. Hepatic glucose metabolism was evaluated by oral glucose tolerance testing, quantification of fasting plasma glucose, insulin and lipids. Mechanistic studies were conducted in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) and HepG2 cells overexpressing glucagon receptor (HepG2‐GCGR). The findings in the mouse model were validated in pre‐transplant livers from PFIC1 patients.

Atp8b1G308V/G308Vmice showed decreased levels of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and insulin, indicating normal insulin sensitivity and impaired hepatic glucagon response. PMHs fromAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmice exhibited reduced glucagon‐dependent cAMP levels and signalling and had increased expression ofPde4isoforms. Rolipram‐mediated PDE4 inhibition restored glucagon signalling. ATP8B1 knockdown HepG2‐GCGR cells also showed increased PDE4D expression and impaired glucagon signalling. Liver tissue from PFIC1 patients exhibited elevated PDE4D and reduced p‐CREB levels and very low glycogen content.

ATP8B1 deficiency causes upregulation of PDE4D in the liver ofAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmice and PFIC1 patients. PDE4D‐mediated glucagon resistance impairs gluconeogenesis and stimulates compensatory glycogenolysis inAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmice and PFIC1 patients. Our study reveals novel metabolic insights of ATP8B1 deficiency in PFIC1 patients.

ATP8B1 deficiency causes progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) and is characterised by infantile‐onset cholestasis but also dyslipidaemia.

ATP8B1 deficiency in mice leads to upregulation of the cAMP‐degrading phosphodiesterase 4D to cause glucagon resistance and impaired gluconeogenesis.

Livers of PFIC1 patients showed increased PDE4D and reduced p‐CREB immunoreactivity and extremely low glycogen content, indicating aberrant glucose metabolism.

Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) is an autosomal recessive cholestatic liver disease caused by mutations inATP8B1, which encodes a phospholipid translocase with a broad substrate specificity [1,2]. Patients typically present during the first few years of life with cholestasis, accompanied by severe pruritus and progressive liver damage that can lead to cirrhosis [3,4]. In addition to cholestasis, PFIC1 patients often develop extrahepatic symptoms and signs, such as hearing impairment, growth failure, abnormal sweat production, pulmonary infection and gastrointestinal problems [3,5,6]. Liver transplantation can alleviate cholestasis, but extrahepatic manifestations may persist or even worsen. Notably, 60%–90% of post‐transplant PFIC1 patients develop hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis [7,8], a condition recently linked to intestinal deficiency of ATP8B1 [9]. This suggests that pre‐transplant PFIC1 patients might have impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, but the metabolic phenotypes could be masked or complicated by concurrent cholestasis. Consistent with this idea, pre‐transplant PFIC1 patients frequently present with hypertriglyceridaemia and low high‐density lipoprotein levels, but the underlying cause remains unclear [10,11].

Glucagon regulates the blood glucose level and fatty acid oxidation [12]. During fasting, low glucose levels trigger glucagon release from pancreatic α‐cells into the hepatic portal system. Glucagon binds to the glucagon receptor (GCGR), activating Gαs and stimulating adenylyl cyclases to produce cAMP. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB) to induce gluconeogenic genes, including glucose‐6‐phosphatase (G6PC1), and via a phosphorylation cascade promoting glycogenolysis. Additionally, GCGR‐cAMP signalling activates phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs), triggering Ca2+release that enhances mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to support gluconeogenesis [13,14].

The steady‐state concentration of cAMP is regulated via its production by adenylyl cyclases and its degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs also play a crucial role in maintaining the compartmentalisation of cAMP signalling microdomains, ensuring the independence and specificity of GPCR signalling [15]. Mammalian PDEs comprise 11 subfamilies with differing substrate specificities and tissue distributions [16]. In the liver, members of the PDE3 and PDE4 subfamilies are key regulators of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis [17]. Notably, elevated PDE4 expression has been associated with various liver pathologies, including cholestasis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease [18,19,20].

In the present study, we investigate the role of ATP8B1 in hepatic glucose metabolism using the pre‐clinical PFIC1 mouse model, theAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmutant mouse [21]. Unlike PFIC1 patients, these mice do not develop cholestasis unless challenged with cholate, allowing us to examine ATP8B1 deficiency without the confounding effects of liver injury. We found that ATP8B1 deficiency impaired hepatic glucose production during fasting, due to increased expression of cAMP‐degrading PDE4D, which suppresses glucagon‐mediated cAMP signalling and impairs gluconeogenesis. Importantly, immunohistochemistry of native livers of PFIC1 patients showed elevated PDE4D, reduced p‐CREB levels and near‐complete absence of hepatic glycogen, strongly suggesting that increased PDE4D dampens glucagon‐driven cAMP signalling, impairs gluconeogenesis and triggers compensatory glycogenolysis.

All animal experiments were approved by the Netherlands Central Authority (CCD No. AVD11800202010784) and followed the Amsterdam UMC Institutional Welfare Committee guidelines. Experiments were mainly conducted in male mice, with mechanistic studies also in females. Control andAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmutant mice (C57BL/6J) [21] were housed separately in a specific‐pathogen‐free facility on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle, fed standard chow, and given water ad libitum. Mice used were 3 to 4 months old, and all data were scored blinded; sample sizes are noted in figure legends.

Mice were fasted for 5 h and then weighed. Blood glucose samples taken from the tail vein were measured for glucose concentrations pre‐glucose gavage using a Glucometer Contour XT (Bayer). Mice were then orally gavaged with 33% (w/v) D‐glucose (Merck) solution at 2 g/kg, and the post‐gavage glucose levels were measured from the tail vein blood at indicated time points.

Liver lipids were extracted according to Srivastava et al. [22]. Plasma triglycerides, non‐esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) and cholesterol were measured using Triglycerides Enzymatic PAP 150 (Trig/GB) kit (Roche), NEFA‐HR (2) reagent (Wako), and Amplex cholesterol assay (ThermoScientific), respectively, according to the manufacturers.

Glycogen was measured as described before [23]. Briefly, liver lysates were treated with NaOH at 80°C to degrade sugars, cooled, deproteinised with metaphosphoric acid (Sigma) and centrifuged. Samples were incubated with amyloglucosidase (Sigma) to convert glycogen to glucose, then mixed with homo vanillic acid (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase (Roche). Baseline fluorescence was recorded before adding glucose oxidase (Sigma), and fluorescence was measured at 37°C until completion using a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech).

Primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) were isolated as described previously [23]. Hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2for 3 h in William's medium E (WME; Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 2 mM glutamine (Lonza) in a 5% CO2, 37°C incubator after which medium was replaced with FBS‐free WME (WME‐SF). Cells were grown for 24 h or 48 h before treated as described. Stock solution of glucagon (287 μM in 10 mM HCl, pH 2), Rolipram (10 mM in DMSO), Forskolin (10 mM in DMSO) and 3‐isobutyl‐1‐methylxanthine (IBMX, 250 mM in DMSO) were prepared from powder obtained from Sigma‐Aldrich.

The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC, HB‐8065) and HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL‐3216) were cultured in high (4.5 g/L) glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza), 2 mM L‐glutamine (Lonza), 100 U/mL penicillin (Lonza) and 100 U/mL streptomycin (Lonza) at 37°C in a 10% CO2humidified atmosphere. A 5′‐FLAG‐tagged human GCGR sequence (GenbankNM_000160.5; ordered with Twist Bioscience) was cloned into a third‐generation lentiviral transfer vector (pLV‐CMV‐IRES‐Puro; Cellomics Technology). Lentivirus was produced in HEK293T cells.

Primary hepatocytes, cultured overnight in WME‐SF, were incubated in 250 μL WME‐SF supplemented with 100 nM glucagon with or without 10 μM Rolipram for the time points indicated. cAMP accumulation was terminated after addition of 100 μL lysis buffer (0.35 M HCl/3.5% [w/v] Triton X‐100). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000× g at 4°C. The supernatant was harvested, and the cAMP levels were measured using the Direct cAMP ELISA kit (Enzo). cAMP values were normalised to protein.

RNA was isolated from mouse livers, PMH and HepG2 cells using TriPURE reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesised using random hexamers, oligo‐dT12‐18primer and Superscript‐III RT (Invitrogen). RT‐qPCR was performed on a CFX96 Realtime system C1000 (Bio Rad) using Sensi FAST Sybr Green (Meridian Bioscience). Expression levels were calculated using LinRegPCR software [24] and normalised to reference genes. Human liver RNA was extracted with NucleoZol (Macherey‐Nagel), cDNA synthesised using the High‐Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), and qRT‐PCR run with SyGreen Blue Mix (PCR Biosystems) on a Bio‐Rad CFX Duet system. Relative expression was calculated by the ΔΔCT method. Primer sequences are listed in TablesS1andS2.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with EDTA‐free protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Surface biotinylation was performed as described [25]. Protein concentrations were determined by Pierce Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay. Lysates were separated by SDS‐PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore) using a semi‐dry blotting system (Bio‐Rad) with either CAPS/methanol or ethanolamine‐glycine buffer. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS‐Tween for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary (see TableS3and [26,27]) and HRP‐conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, with washes between incubations. Membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence and imaged on an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki with prior approval from institutional human research committees. Liver samples, clinical information, and laboratory data from male and female PFIC1 patients and healthy controls were collected from Amsterdam University Medical Center, Medical University of Innsbruck, National Taiwan University Hospital, and Hannover Medical School under respective IRB approvals. Specifically, paraffin‐embedded liver biopsies from two PFIC1 patients were obtained from Innsbruck (IRB #1029/2017) [28]. Amsterdam UMC provided snap‐frozen and formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) liver tissues from two healthy controls (IRB W19_375 #19.440). National Taiwan University Hospital contributed fresh frozen liver samples from four PFIC1 patients [29,30] and two healthy transplant donors (IRB #200801071R). Hannover Medical School provided FFPE explant liver tissues and clinical data from two PFIC1 patients with informed consent. Clinical and laboratory details for PFIC1 patients and controls are summarised in Tables1and2.

Oil Red O staining was performed on 6 μm liver cryosections fixed in 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed, stained with Oil Red O (Sigma) working solution for 30 min, rinsed in running tap water for 10 min, mounted in glycerol‐gelatin and imaged using an Olympus BX51 microscope.

Five‐micron sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and endogenous peroxidase quenched with 0.3% H2O2in methanol. After antigen retrieval at 120°C in sodium citrate buffer, slides were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies against PDE4D or p‐CREB. Binding was detected using HRP‐labelled secondary antibodies (Immunologic) and diaminobenzidine (Sigma‐Aldrich), followed by Mayer's haematoxylin counterstaining. Sections were imaged in an Olympus BX51 microscope. PDE4D‐positive surface area quantification was performed blinded on at least 8 non‐overlapping sections of 2 PFIC1/healthy controls (HCs) transplant livers and 2Atp8b1/WT mutant livers by applying intensity thresholds to grayscale images in ImageJ 1.50i (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), generating binary masks that isolate positive staining. Area and mean intensity metrics within the thresholded regions were quantified to assess staining levels. Threshold values were manually optimised to minimise background inclusion.

PAS‐D staining was performed on FFPE liver sections to detect glycogen. Sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and incubated with or without 2.5 mg/mL α‐amylase (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, slides were treated with 1% periodic acid (Sigma) for 8 min, washed again and stained with Schiff's reagent (Merck) for 10 min. Following a tap water wash, sections were dehydrated, mounted in Entellan (Merck) and imaged using an Olympus BX51 microscope.

To understand the metabolic consequence of ATP8B1 deficiency, we investigated the systemic metabolic profile inAtp8b1G308V/G308Vmice (hereafterAtp8b1mutant mice). In contrast to hyperlipidaemia as observed in cholestatic PFIC1 patients [10,11],Atp8b1mutant mice (without cholestasis) did not show signs of hyperlipidaemia, as evidenced by reduced fasting plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol (Figure1A,B). Compared to wild type (WT) controls,Atp8b1mutant mice had reduced fasting blood glucose levels (Figure1C). Liver histology and Oil Red O staining showed accumulation of neutral lipids inAtp8b1mutant livers (Figure1D). Enzymatic quantification of hepatic lipids revealed increased triglyceride levels but unaffected total cholesterol levels inAtp8b1mutant livers (Figure1E,F). Interestingly, was this phenotype associated with six‐fold higher expression of the fatty acid transporterCd36, but not of the low‐density lipoprotein receptorLdlr(Figure1G). These data show that, in the absence of cholestasis, ATP8B1 deficiency causes hypolipidaemia, hepatic steatosis and fasting hypoglycaemia. Because intestinal ATP8B1 deficiency is known to cause hepatic steatosis [9], we focused on the effect of ATP8B1 deficiency on glucose metabolism.

Because blood glucose levels are regulated by insulin and glucagon signalling, we examined the insulin sensitivity inAtp8b1mutant mice. Oral glucose tolerance testing indicated no difference in insulin sensitivity between WT andAtp8b1mutant mice, but a reduced baseline glucose level inAtp8b1mutant mice (Figure2A). In addition, the fasting plasma non‐esterified fatty acid levels were normal in theAtp8b1mutant mice, also indicating normal insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues (Figure2B). Consistently, fasting plasma insulin levels were reduced inAtp8b1mutant mice (Figure2C), while Akt signalling was ~50% reduced in freshly isolatedAtp8b1mutant hepatocytes (Figure2D), ruling out hyperinsulinaemia and insulin hypersensitivity as the cause of reduced fasting glucose and suggesting thatAtp8b1mutant mice have impaired gluconeogenesis. Indeed, compared to WT mice,Atp8b1mutant mice had 55% reduced hepatic expression of glucose‐6‐phosphatase (G6pc1) despite a slightly upregulation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (Pgc1a) (Figure2E). The expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) was not affected inAtp8b1mutant mice. In addition to hypoglycaemia and reduced hepaticG6pc1expression, hepatic glycogen stores, an additional source for hepatic glucose output, tended to be reduced in fastedAtp8b1mutant mice compared to WT mice (Figure2F). Together, the data suggest thatAtp8b1mutant mice have normal insulin sensitivity but have an impaired glucagon response.

Atp8b1mutant mice are glucose tolerant and display signs of impaired gluconeogenesis.

We next investigated how ATP8B1 deficiency leads to impaired induction of gluconeogenesis genes using PMHs. Although the expression of GCGR was not affected inAtp8b1mutant livers (Figure3A), stimulatingAtp8b1mutant PMHs with glucagon failed to induce the expression ofG6pc1(Figure3B), indicating that glucagon‐dependent cAMP signalling was impaired. Stimulation with forskolin, a pan‐adenylyl cyclase activator, also failed to restoreG6pc1expression inAtp8b1mutant PMHs. Indeed, glucagon‐treatedAtp8b1mutant PMHs accumulated significantly less cAMP in comparison to WT PMHs (Figure3C). Notably, even in the absence of glucagon, basal cAMP levels inAtp8b1mutant PMHs were significantly lower than those of WT PMHs (Figure3D), suggesting that there was either decreased cAMP production by adenylyl cyclases or increased cAMP degradation by PDEs. To test if the reduced cAMP level in glucagon‐stimulatedAtp8b1mutant PMHs was caused by reduced adenylyl cyclase activity, we quantified cAMP levels in the presence of forskolin and the broad‐spectrum PDE inhibitor, IBMX.Atp8b1mutant and WT PMHs produced comparable amounts of cAMP following treatment with IBMX and forskolin (Figure3E), indicating that not cAMP production, but increased cAMP degradation impaired glucagon signalling inAtp8b1mutant PMHs.

(B)G6pc1mRNA expression in male wild type andAtp8b1mutant primary hepatocytes incubated for 3 h with 100 nM Glucagon or 10 μM Forskolin. mRNA expression was corrected for the geometric mean ofß‐ActinandHprtmRNA, normalised to wild type—Vehicle and expressed as mean ± standard deviation ofn= 5 independent hepatocyte isolations.

Because the cAMP‐degrading phosphodiesterase PDE4 isoforms are known to regulate hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis [17], we assessed the expression ofPde4isoforms in whole liver and foundPde4bandPde4cmildly increased (~twofold), whilePde4dexpression was increased fourfold in maleAtp8b1mutant livers (Figure4A). Importantly, all otherPdeisoforms known to be expressed in mouse hepatocytes (www.livercellatlas.org), except forPde8a, which was mildly down‐regulated, were not affected inAtp8b1mutant liver (FigureS1A).Pde4dexpression was not affected in the colon ofAtp8b1mutant mice (FigureS1B).Pde4bandPde4dwere increased ~twofold in overnight‐culturedAtp8b1mutant PMHs (Figure4B). Immunoblotting of whole liver lysates showed a threefold increase in PDE4D protein levels inAtp8b1mutant livers (Figure4C). Immunohistochemistry revealed that PDE4D was localised to mid‐zone and pericentral hepatocytes in the liver of WT andAtp8b1mutant liver, while this distribution was not affected inAtp8b1mutant liver (Figure4D). Importantly, Rolipram, a PDE4‐selective inhibitor, largely restored cAMP production as well as induction ofG6pc1expression in glucagon‐stimulated maleAtp8b1mutant PMHs (Figure4E,F).

(F)G6pc1mRNA expression in male wild type andAtp8b1mutant primary mouse hepatocytes incubated for 3 h with 100 nM Glucagon, 10 μM Rolipram or Glucagon/Rolipram. mRNA expression was corrected for the geometric mean ofß‐ActinandHprtmRNA, normalised to wild type—vehicle and expressed as mean ± standard deviation ofn= 4–5 independent hepatocyte isolations. Statistical analyses by two‐way ANOVA with Tukey correction for multiple analyses; **p< 0.005; ****p< 0.0001. All other statistical analyses by Student'st‐test; *p< 0.05; **p< 0.005; ***p< 0.0005; ****p< 0.0001.

Similar to male mice, femaleAtp8b1mutant liver also showed a ~twofold reduced expression ofG6pc1while only a mild (~twofold, as opposed to fourfold in males) upregulation ofPde4dwas observed (FigureS1C). Although female PMHs were mildly glucagon insensitive, this could not be rescued by rolipram (FigureS1D). Overall, our results show that upregulation of PDE4D in maleAtp8b1mutant PMHs impairs glucagon‐dependent cAMP signalling and transcriptional induction ofG6pc1, which could be rescued by PDE4‐selective inhibition.

Finally, we examined if ATP8B1 deficiency also impaired glucagon signalling in HepG2 cells and human PFIC1 livers. Because parental HepG2 cells did not express GCGRs and did not upregulateG6PC1in response to glucagon (FigureS2A), we overexpressed the human GCGR in HepG2 cells (hereafter HepG2‐GCGR cells; FigureS2B). In contrast to HepG2 parental cells, HepG2‐GCGR cells were responsive to glucagon as evidenced by the induction ofG6PC1expression (FigureS2C). To model ATP8B1 deficiency in human hepatocytes, we knocked down ATP8B1 in HepG2‐GCGR cells. ATP8B1 knockdown did not affect GCGR surface expression as shown by surface biotinylation (Figure5A). However, similar toAtp8b1mutant PMHs, ATP8B1 knockdown in HepG2‐GCGR cells resulted in impaired glucagon‐dependentG6PC1expression (Figure5B) and a concomitant up‐regulation ofPDE4Dexpression (Figure5C). To translate our findings inAtp8b1mutant mice,Atp8b1mutant PMHs and ATP8B1 knockdown HepG2‐GCGR cells, we examined the mRNA and protein expression of PDE4D in the native livers of PFIC1 patients (Table1) and healthy control subjects (Table2).PDE4Dwas significantly upregulated in PFIC1 livers compared to healthy control livers (Figure5D). In contrast toAtp8b1mutant liver, PFIC1 liver showed neither steatosis nor elevatedCD36orLDLRexpression (FigureS3A). Notably, immunohistochemistry revealed clearly increased PDE4D immunoreactivity in hepatocytes of PFIC1 liver, while this was not detected in the liver of HC (Figure5E). Importantly, immunohistochemical detection of phospho‐CREB showed a strongly reduced nuclear staining in hepatocytes of (fasted) PFIC1 liver, which is consistent with a defective cAMP‐PKA‐CREB signalling cascade due to PDE4D upregulation (Figure5F). Moreover, PAS staining and PAS‐D staining revealed a near complete depletion of hepatic glycogen in PFIC1 livers (Figure5G, FigureS3B), which indicates that PFIC1 livers had enhanced glycogenolysis to compensate for impaired gluconeogenesis and to maintain a normal blood glucose level.

PDE4D Is increased in ATP8B1 KD HepG2‐GCGR cells as well as in PFIC1 patient liver. (A) Cell surface biotinylation of ATP8B1KD HepG2‐GCGR cells. ATP8B1 and GCGR in the lysate fractions were below the detection limit. In the eluate (plasma membrane) fraction, the ATP8B1 level was strongly reduced in ATP8B1KD HepG2, while the GCGR level was not affected by ATP8B1 knockdown. (B)G6PC1expression in HepG2‐GCGR cells shows a significant reduction in glucagon‐mediated signalling in ATP8B1 KD cells. (C)PDE4Dexpression in HepG2‐GCGR cells.

Under hypoglycaemic conditions, glucagon promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output by GCGR‐dependent cAMP signalling [12]. The cAMP pool generated by GCGR‐dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase is compartmentalised, with the cAMP concentration gradient controlled by the balance between the plasma membrane adenylyl cyclases and the cAMP‐degrading PDEs. In the present study, we show that ATP8B1 deficiency in mice leads to glucagon resistance and fasting hypoglycaemia and identify that increased PDE4 expression in human and mouse ATP8B1‐deficient hepatocytes mediates this glucagon resistance. First,Atp8b1mutant hepatocytes were insensitive to glucagon‐dependent induction of gluconeogenic (G6pc1) gene expression, and ATP8B1 knockdown in HepG2‐GCGR cells abolished glucagon‐dependentG6PC1induction. Second, compared to WT PMHs,Atp8b1mutant PMHs had significantly lower cAMP levels both at baseline and after glucagon stimulation, indicating enhanced cAMP degradation by PDEs. Third,Atp8b1mutant mice have increased expression ofPde4b, Pde4candPde4din the liver. Fourth, rolipram‐mediated inhibition of PDE4 activity restored cAMP levels as well as glucagon‐dependentG6pc1mRNA expression in maleAtp8b1mutant PMHs. Finally, native livers of PFIC1 patients showed markedly increased PDE4D and strongly reduced nuclear p‐CREB staining in hepatocytes.

Although further experiments are required to conclusively establish PDE4D's causative role in vivo, the increased PDE4D and the reduced nuclear p‐CREB levels in PFIC1 liver strongly suggest that PFIC1 patients, like theAtp8b1mutant mice, have a defect in glucagon‐dependent cAMP signalling, leading to impaired gluconeogenesis. Despite the lack of direct evidence of glucagon resistance in PFIC1 patients, the near absence of glycogen in native PFIC1 livers suggests that the PFIC1 liver compensates impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis with enhanced glycogenolysis to maintain normal blood glucose levels during fasting. Although cirrhosis of PFIC1 livers could contribute to decreased hepatic glycogen levels, a trend of enhanced compensatory glycogenolysis was also observed in the (non‐cirrhotic) livers ofAtp8b1mutant mice. In addition to hepatic glucagon resistance, increased PDE4 expression in hepatocytes can be expected to dampen cAMP signalling of other G‐protein‐coupled receptors, such as β2‐adrenergic receptor signalling, which can mobilise lipases adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL) to promote lipolysis of lipid droplets [31].

We show thatAtp8b1mutant mice were glucose tolerant and, surprisingly, had reduced plasma insulin levels. PDE4‐mediated hepatic glucagon resistance and fasting hypoglycaemia likely contribute to the suppression of insulin secretion by β‐cells in the pancreas. In addition, Ansari and colleagues previously showed that ATP8B1 knockdown in a human pancreatic beta cell line as well as in rat and human pancreatic islands resulted in a ~50% reduction in glucose‐induced insulin release from these cells [32], which may explain the reduced insulin levels inAtp8b1mutant mice. Insulin is known to suppress hepatic secretion of Insulin‐like growth factor‐binding protein 1 (IGFBP‐1), a plasma protein that binds and inhibits insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1) signalling [33]. Because IGF‐1 is the key effector of growth hormones and inhibits hair cell apoptosis [34], we speculate that chronic suppression of IGF‐1 signalling due to reduced blood insulin levels can contribute to growth failure and hearing impairment in PFIC1 patients [5] andAtp8b1mutant mice [6,21].

In the present study, we observed hepatic steatosis in non‐cholestatic, maleAtp8b1whole body mutant mice, which highly resembles graft steatosis in PFIC1 patients after liver transplantation [7,8,35,36]. The steatosis of graft livers in PFIC1 patients is presumably caused by extra‐hepatic ATP8B1 deficiency. This assumption is strengthened by recent observations by Tamura and colleagues [9], who showed that knockout of ATP8B1 in intestinal epithelial cells in mice (Atp8b1IEC‐KO) caused hepatic steatohepatitis. The authors showed that maleAtp8b1IEC‐KOmice as well as pre‐ and post‐transplant PFIC1 patients had reduced plasma choline levels [9]. Choline supplementation of the diet rescued the steatosis phenotype in maleAtp8b1IEC‐KOmice, suggesting that impaired intestinal choline absorption causes steatohepatitis in mice and post‐transplant steatosis in the PFIC1 patients [9]. Hence, the hepatic steatosis observed in our mice may thus be caused by intestinal deficiency of ATP8B1. Still, we cannot exclude that increased hepatic PDE4D expression and impaired glucagon‐cAMP signalling contribute to hepatic steatosis inAtp8b1mutant mice. First, glucagon is known to stimulate ß‐oxidation of fatty acids in mice and in healthy humans as well as in subjects with MASLD/MASH [37,38]. Second, a high‐fat diet induces hepatic steatosis with a concomitant increase of hepatic PDE4D in mice, while over‐expression of PDE4D by adeno‐associated virus 8 in wild‐type livers directly resulted in hepatic steatosis in the absence of a high‐fat diet [19]. Notably, PDE4D overexpression in mouse liver increased CD36 expression [19], suggesting that the PDE4D‐CD36 axis might contribute to the hepatic steatosis observed inAtp8b1mutant mice. Finally, hepatic steatosis in ALD coincided with reduced cAMP levels and increased PDE4A‐PDE4D isoform levels, both in alcohol‐fed mice and patients with ALD; Rolipram‐mediated PDE4 inhibition restored cAMP levels in the liver of these mice and attenuated lipid accumulation, underscoring the importance of regulated PDE4‐mediated cAMP signalling in lipid metabolism [20,39].

An overt difference betweenAtp8b1mutant mice and PFIC1 patients is hepatic steatosis, which is not observed in pre‐transplant PFIC1 patients but is strikingly prevalent in post‐transplant PFIC1 patients [7,8,35,36]. Several explanations on top of impaired intestinal absorption of choline (see above) are possible. First, in contrast to pre‐transplant PFIC1 patients, which present with strongly elevated plasma bile salt levels and hepatic bile salt retention,Atp8b1mutant mice have only marginally elevated plasma bile salt levels and an unaffected bile flow and bile salt secretion [21]. Because graft steatosis in post‐transplant PFIC1 patients can be prevented or reversed by internal biliary diversion effectively [40], the (unaffected) enterohepatic cycling of bile salts in theAtp8b1mutant mice likely contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis. Second, hepatic steatosis inAtp8b1mutant liver coincided with increased expression ofCd36, which is involved in the uptake of medium‐ and long‐chain fatty acids. In pre‐transplant PFIC1 liver, on the other hand,CD36expression was not induced, which is consistent with the absence of steatosis. It will be of interest to assessCD36expression in post‐transplant (steatotic) PFIC1 livers. Finally, hepatic bile salt retention could, despite causing liver pathology, engage metabolic or anti‐inflammatory transcriptional programmes to reverse steatosis for instance via FXR activation [41]. Indeed,Fxr−/−mice develop hepatic steatosis [42], whereas FXR activation by bile salts reduces hepatic fat accumulation [43].

Our data suggest a causal link between ATP8B1 and PDE4D. PDE4D is upregulated in livers ofAtp8b1mutant mice and PFIC1 patients and increases following ATP8B1 knockdown in HepG2‐GCGR cells. An inverse correlation between hepaticPde4dandAtp8b1expression was also observed across 41 inbred mouse strains [44] (FigureS4); hepatic transcriptomic data deposited by Wu et al. [45], suggesting ATP8B1 fine‐tunes hepatic PDE4D levels independently of genetic or dietary interventions. This regulation is tissue‐specific, as colonPde4dexpression remained unchanged in mutants. While further experiments are needed to establish a direct causal link between ATP8B1 and PDE4D, we can propose a potential mechanism connecting both proteins, possibly involving ATP8B1's function as a phospholipid flippase [2]. ATP8B1 promotes local clustering of phosphatidylserine to create docking sites for small GTPases [46], regulating their activity. A similar process might regulatePDE4Dexpression; the stability ofPDE4DmRNA is negatively regulated by a protein kinase C (PKC) signalling pathway [47]. Since PKC activation depends on phosphatidylserine interaction, ATP8B1 deficiency could impair PKC signalling, leading to increasedPDE4Dexpression.

PDE4D activity is also regulated by PKA‐dependent phosphorylation within cAMP signalling microdomains [48], which involves several phospholipid‐interacting scaffolding proteins, potentially linking it to ATP8B1. For instance, the scaffolding protein coiled‐coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A) has a high affinity for phosphatic acid and phosphatidylserine and modulates cAMP signalling [49]. Interestingly, mutation ofCc2d1ain the hippocampus of mice leads to male‐selective PDE4D hyperactivity, which was reversed by PDE4D inhibition [50]. The latter example highlights potential sex‐specific regulation of cAMP signalling by PDE4D inAtp8b1mutant hepatocytes, as female hepatocytes exhibited lessPde4dupregulation and no Rolipram‐induced rescue of glucagon signalling, suggesting sex‐biased mechanisms. Further study is needed to determine if ATP8B1 regulates PDE4D activity, transcriptionally and post‐translationally, by controlling local membrane phospholipid distribution.

Our study uncovers a novel role of hepatic ATP8B1 in regulating glucose metabolism. ATP8B1 deficiency in the liver leads to PDE4D‐mediated suppression of cAMP signalling, causing glucagon resistance, impaired gluconeogenesis, and compensatory glycogenolysis in hepatocytes. These findings identify PDE4D as a potential therapeutic target for liver pathology in PFIC1 patients and provide new metabolic insights into the mechanisms underlying their extrahepatic anomalies.
