The lunge is a critical movement in badminton, facilitating rapid and efficient court coverage and enabling players to promptly reach the hitting position. While previous studies have examined the influence of lunge direction on lower limb biomechanics, the effects of gender have yet to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effects of direction and gender on lower limb biomechanics during forehand and backhand forward lunges in amateur badminton players.

16 male and 16 female amateur players were recruited. Kinematic and kinetic data were measured synchronously using a Vicon motion capture system and a Kistler force plate. A two-way mixed-design ANOVA was used to explore the effects of different lunge directions, gender, and the interaction between the two factors on each parameter. Joint angles during the stance phase were analyzed using the statistical nonparametric mapping method.

Interaction effects between gender and direction were observed for the second impact of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), knee peak external rotation moment, ankle sagittal angles and knee frontal and transverse moments during the stance phase. Compared with the females, the males showed significantly greater loading rate and impulse of VGRF, peak flexion, sagittal range of motion (ROM) and abduction moment of knee joint. The sagittal ROM of hip and knee joint and the knee flexion moment around 84% of the stance phase during backhand lunge was significantly greater than during forehand lunge. In contrast, the sagittal ROM of ankle joint and peak abduction moment of knee joint was significantly lower during backhand lunge.

Gender-specific biomechanical strategies influence knee loading patterns during badminton lunges, contributing to direction-dependent variations in injury risk. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating directional biomechanical demands and sex-specific neuromuscular adaptations into training and injury prevention programs to mitigate injury risks.

Badminton is among the most widely practiced sports globally, engaging approximately 200 million participants annually across both recreational and elite levels [1]. Players are required to execute rapid movements in response to swift changes in body position, underscoring the dynamic and continuous nature of competitive rallies [2,3]. Among various footwork patterns, the lunge is one of the most frequently performed techniques, accounting for over 15% of all movements during a match [4]. This movement enables players to swiftly reach the shuttlecock, particularly during high-intensity rallies [5]. However, it also imposes substantial mechanical loads on the lower limbs. Specifically, the peak impact force during lunging can reach up to 2.5 times body weight (BW) [1], increasing muscular demands to stabilize the ankle and knee joints. A latest systemic review has identified the lower limbs as the most frequently injured body region in badminton athletes [6]. Accordingly, a comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical characteristics of lunging is critical for both injury mitigation and performance optimization.

The forehand lunge and backhand lunge are two fundamental forward lunges with the high frequency in gameplay. Hong et al. [7] (2014) reported that left-forward lunge generated higher ground reaction force (GRF) loading rates and plantar pressures in male university players, suggesting a higher injury risk during backhand lunges. Tong et al. [8] further demonstrated that both the mean and maximum loading rate increased significantly during backhand lunge when the ankle dorsiflexors were fatigued. Sustained exposure to such high impact forces is a potential contributor to overuse injuries in the lower limbs. On the other hand, greater alterations in the sagittal and frontal plane motions of the ankle and knee joints have been observed during forehand lunges after fatigue. From a kinetic perspective, forehand lungs produce lower hip and knee transverse moments but greater frontal moments [9]. The knee adduction moment which is regarded as a surrogate of medial compartment loading has been shown to be associated with knee pain [10]. The aforementioned studies have focused exclusively on male players, limiting the generalizability of their findings.

Gender-based differences in biomechanics and injury prevalence have been well documented in badminton [11]. For example, Miyake et al. [12] reported an overall injury rate ranging from 0.9 to 5.1 per 1000 h, with female players exhibiting significantly higher injury rates than male players during practice, and injury incidence increasing with age. In a study of Japanese athletes aged 7–22, male injury rates peaked at ~ 3.24/1000 h (aged 15–16 years), while female rates peaked at ~ 3.52/1000 h (aged 17–18 years) [13]. Previous studies have reported that female athletes are three to six times more likely than males to sustain anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries during similar physical activities. In badminton-specific tasks, such as single-leg landings following a backhand overhead stroke in the backcourt, female players have been shown to exhibit significantly lower leg and knee stiffness compared to males [14]. This may contribute to reduced dynamic stability and a higher risk of non-contact ACL injuries in female players. Lam et al. [15] reported that greater impact loading rates and peak knee flexion moments during forehand lunges predispose male players to a higher risk of overuse injuries compared to their female counterparts. Moreover, an interaction effect between gender and skill level was identified, with unskilled female athletes exhibiting heightened vulnerability to lower limb injuries. Increased knee ligamentous injury risk was also observed in elite badminton athletes with larger keen extension and abduction moments in comparison to recreational players [16]. Recent findings have highlighted differences in lower limb biomechanics between forehand and backhand lunges among female amateur players. Specifically, the backhand lunge is associated with greater hip internal rotation angles and increased ankle varus angles, whereas the forehand lunge demonstrates greater hip stiffness [15]. Despite these insights, the interactive effects of lunge direction and gender on lower limb mechanics remain inadequately explored.

Given the strong association between sport-specific movements and injury mechanisms, it is imperative to examine gender-based biomechanical variations during forward lunges in badminton. Such knowledge can inform the design of gender-sensitive training and injury prevention protocols. Therefore, this study aims to investigate differences in GRF, knee joint moments, and lower limb kinematics between male and female badminton athletes during forehand and backhand forward lunges. We hypothesize that male and female players will exhibit distinct GRF profiles and joint mechanics when performing forward lunges in different directions.

The required sample size was estimated based on data from previous studies [17,18] and pilot testing conducted prior to the main experiment using G*Power 3.1 software. Assuming an alpha level of 0.05, statistical power of 0.80, and an effect size (f) of 0.50—derived from pilot data that showed substantial differences in key biomechanical variables (e.g., joint angles, ground reaction forces) under different conditions—a total of 32 participants (16 males and 16 females) were determined to be sufficient for the analysis. A total of 16 male and 16 female amateur badminton players (male: age 23.81 ± 3.22 years, height 178.35 ± 4.68 cm, weight 71.88 ± 7.05 kg; female: age 22.65 ± 1.74 years, height 164.18 ± 3.56 cm, weight 57.01 ± 5.14 kg) were involved in this study. According to the Participant Classification Framework proposed by McKay et al. (2022) [19], all subjects met the definition of Tier 2 (Trained/Developmental): regular training about 3 times a week, focusing on badminton training with the goal of participating in competitions, and possessing certain sports skills but still in the development stage. Participants were recruited according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) a minimum of three years of consistent badminton training, (2) engagement in regular practice sessions of at least five hours per week over the preceding three years, (3) right-handed racket use with right-leg dominance, (4) no history of lower limb injuries that could affect athletic performance within one year prior to testing, and (5) abstention from strenuous physical activity within 24 h before the experiment. All participants were informed about the study’s purpose, procedures, and requirements, and provided written informed consent prior to data collection. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Ningbo University (Approval No. RAGH20240817).

The experiment was conducted in the Sports Biomechanics Laboratory at Ningbo University, where half of a standard badminton court was constructed in accordance with international competition regulations. To replicate realistic match conditions, the net height was set at the official midpoint value of 1.524 m, ensuring that participants’ movement postures were representative of actual gameplay scenarios (Fig.1a). A shuttlecock was suspended at a distance of approximately twice the participant’s leg length from the starting position, with its height adjusted to 70% of the participant’s standing height. This configuration was designed to simulate a realistic shuttle trajectory and landing position, thereby enhancing ecological validity. Prior to testing, all participants completed a 10-minute treadmill warm-up at a speed of 7 km/h under the supervision of the experimenter. They were also allowed sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the lunge tasks to ensure proper execution during data collection.

Participants began each trial from a standardized starting point located 1.5 times their leg length away from the force platform. Leg length was defined as the vertical distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the ground [9,17]. From this position, participants performed both forehand and backhand lunges toward a force plate while simultaneously flicking the shuttle over the net and returning to the starting point. A certified badminton coach assessed and validated the quality of each lunge during testing. To eliminate the confounding influence of footwear variability, all participants wore the same model and brand of badminton shoes from ANTA (China), specifically designed for badminton play [20]. The experimental lunge protocols were adapted from established methodologies [4,15,21]. A forehand lunge was defined as a forward movement toward the racket side with the torso facing the net, followed by a rapid recovery to the starting position (Fig.1b). A backhand lunge involved a forward motion toward the non-racket side with the back facing the net. For both directions, each lunge was required to cover a horizontal distance of 1.5 times the participant’s leg length and be completed within three seconds. Trials were discarded and repeated if participants experienced significant slippage of the lower limbs or if the movement lacked continuity. To standardize performance intensity, participants were instructed to perform all movements at maximal speed. To mitigate fatigue effects, a one-minute rest interval was provided between trials. Each participant was instructed to perform ten lunge trials in each direction. Of these, five valid trials were retained for analysis based on the following criteria: (1) complete and continuous motion capture data without significant marker occlusion; (2) proper execution of the lunge task in accordance with the experimental protocol, including accurate foot placement on the force platform and the absence of balance loss or compensatory movements; and (3) accurate and consistent ground reaction force data collected from the force platform. Trials failing to meet any of these criteria were excluded to ensure the validity and reliability of the kinetic and kinematic analyses.

Kinematic data were captured using a ten-camera motion analysis system (Vicon Metrics Ltd., MX-T20, Oxford, UK) operating at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz. The marker set used in this study was based on the OpenSim 2392 musculoskeletal model and consisted of 38 reflective markers placed on key anatomical landmarks. Markers were positioned on the torso (left and right acromion), pelvis (bilateral anterior superior iliac spines and posterior superior iliac spines), thighs (four-marker clusters on the lateral aspect), knees (medial and lateral femoral epicondyles), shanks (four-marker clusters on the lateral aspect), ankles (medial and lateral malleoli), and feet (posterior calcaneus, toe tip, first and fifth metatarsal heads) [22]. Simultaneously, GRF data were recorded using a three-dimensional force platform (Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The force plates were zeroed before each trial to ensure data accuracy.

Marker trajectories captured by the motion analysis system were processed using Vicon Nexus software (version 1.8.5 A, Vicon Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). The processing workflow included marker identification and labeling, as well as the interpolation or removal of redundant and missing data. The landing phase of the lunge was defined as the period from initial heel contact (identified as vertical ground reaction force [VGRF] exceeding 20 N) to toe-off (VGRF falling below 20 N) [23]. Kinematic and kinetic data corresponding to this phase were exported in C3D format and subsequently imported into OpenSim 4.1 for further analysis of joint angles and dynamic variables. All raw signals were filtered using a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filter, with cutoff frequencies of 10 Hz for kinematic data and 50 Hz for kinetic data [24]. The OpenSim 2392 musculoskeletal model was employed in accordance with established modeling procedures [25–27]. The model was first scaled to match each participant’s anthropometric characteristics. Lower limb joint angles were computed using inverse kinematics algorithms to minimize marker tracking errors. Notably, all joint angles reported are anatomical joint angles defined relative to the neutral anatomical position. Segment coordinate systems were established based on the static calibration trial with participants in the anatomical posture, following the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) recommendations [28]. Joint angles were calculated using Cardan angles in a proximal-to-distal sequence, where 0° corresponds to the neutral anatomical position. Thus, the angular values represent deviations from this standardized anatomical reference. These joint angles, along with synchronized GRF data, were then used as inputs for inverse dynamics calculations to estimate joint moments.

The variables for analysis included the first and second impacts, the first vertical peak loading rate and the total impulse of VGRF; the sagittal angles at initial contact (IC) and the peak angles of the hip, knee and ankle joint; the sagittal range of motion (ROM) and knee joint moments in three planes. Maximum (Max) and minimum (Min) sagittal angles during the stance phase were identified, with the ROM calculated as Max − Min. The loading rate was defined as the maximum slope of the VGRF curve between the data points corresponding to 20% and 80% of the initial impact [29,30]. To facilitate intergroup comparisons, GRF-related and knee moment parameters were normalized to each participant’s BW. For joint kinematic and kinetic variables, sign conventions were defined as follows: negative values indicated extension, abduction, eversion, plantarflexion, or external rotation at the hip and ankle joints; positive values represented flexion, adduction, inversion, dorsiflexion, or internal rotation. For the knee joint, negative values denoted flexion, eversion, or external rotation, while positive values indicated extension, inversion, or internal rotation. A neutral standing posture was defined as 0°.

All discrete variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Data were presented as mean (standard deviation). A two-way mixed-design ANOVA was conducted with gender (male, female) as a between-subject factor and lunge direction (forehand, backhand) as a within-subject factor. When a significant interaction effect was found, pairwise simple effects analyses were performed to explore the source of interaction, and Bonferroni correction was applied. All statistical analyses of discrete data were performed in SPSS (Version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), with significance set atp< 0.05. For the time-series data (joint angles and joint moments), the two-way mixed-design ANOVA in Statistical Nonparametric Mapping (SnPM) was used, which is based on label permutation tests. This analysis was implemented in MATLAB R2018a (The MathWorks, MA, USA). For each time point in the stance phase (0–100%), F-statistics were computed to identify significant main effects and interaction effects. The statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

As shown in Table1, there was no interactive effect of initial impact between lunge direction and gender. Neither of the main effects was significant. For the secondary impact, a significant interaction was observed between lunge direction and gender. The simple effects analysis showed that the secondary impact during the forehand lunge was significantly higher than that during the backhand lunge by 0.19 BW in females. While no significant difference within lunge direction was found in males (p= 0.174). Regarding gender differences, during the forehand lunge, the secondary impact in males was significantly lower than in females, while no significant simple main effect was found during the backhand lunge (p= 0.951). There was no significant interaction between lunge direction and gender for the first VGRF peak loading rate, while the main effect of gender was significant. Compared to females, males exhibited a significantly higher first VGRF peak loading rate by 9.585 N/kg%. Similarly, for the total impulse during foot contact, there was no significant interaction effect, whereas the main effect of gender was significant. Compared to females, males exhibited a significantly higher total impulse during foot contact, increasing by 0.06 BW·s (Fig.2).

All discrete kinematic data with significant differences are presented in Table2. For the hip joint angle at IC, there was no significant interaction between direction and gender. The main effect of direction on the hip joint angle at IC was not significant. Compared to males, females exhibited a significantly greater hip joint angle at IC by 6.56°. For the knee and ankle angles at IC, no significant interaction between direction and gender was observed. Compared to males, females exhibited a significantly lower ankle angle at IC by 3.03°.

Significant differences in the peak angles in the sagittal plane between the forehand lunge and backhand lunge were observed. For the peak hip flexion, there was no significant interaction between direction and gender. The main effect of direction was significant. Compared to the forehand lunge, the backhand lunge showed a significantly greater maximum hip angle by 3.41°. For the peak knee angle in the sagittal plane, no significant interaction between direction and gender was found, while the main effects were significant. Compared to males, females exhibited a significantly lower peak knee angle by 14.31°. Additionally, compared to the forehand lunge, the backhand lunge showed a significantly greater knee angle by 2.79°. For the peak ankle angle in the sagittal plane, compared to males, females exhibited a significantly greater peak ankle angle by 2.84°.

There was no significant interaction between direction and gender in hip, knee and ankle ROMs. Compared to the forehand lunge, the backhand lunge showed a significantly greater hip ROM by 3.92° and a significantly reduced ankle ROM by 1.12°. Moreover, females exhibited a significantly lower knee ROM during the lunge by 8.79° than males.

No significant interaction effects between gender and direction were observed for hip flexion angles throughout the entire stance phase (Fig.3). A main effect of gender was identified, with F-values exceeding the significance threshold approximately between 2% − 7% and 16% − 18% of the stance phase. During this period, female players exhibited greater hip flexion angles compared to male players. No significant main effect of direction was found for hip flexion angles during the stance phase. Neither significant interaction and main effects were detected for knee flexion angles during the entire stance phase (Fig.4). Significant interaction effects between gender and direction were observed for ankle dorsiflexion angles during the stance phase (Fig.5). The F-values exceeded the significance threshold approximately between 48% and 49% of the stance phase. During this interval, the ankle dorsiflexion angles differed significantly between male and female players depending on the lunge direction.

As shown in Table3, no significant interaction effects between gender and direction were observed for peak flexion and adduction moments of the knee. There were significant main effects of gender and direction for peak abduction moment. Compared to males, females exhibited significantly lower knee abduction moments by 0.12 BW, and compared to the forehand lunge, the backhand lunge showed significantly reduced knee abduction moments by 0.16 BW. A significant interaction effect between gender and direction was observed for the peak external rotation moment. The simple effects analysis showed that the external rotation moment was significantly greater in the backhand lunge than in the forehand lunge by 0.24 BW for females (p< 0.001), while no significant simple main effect of direction was observed for males (p= 0.053). Regarding direction, the backhand lunge resulted in significantly lower external rotation moments in males than in females (p< 0.001), whereas no significant gender difference was observed in the forehand lunge (p= 0.723).

In the sagittal plane (Fig.6), no significant interaction effects between gender and direction were during the entire stance phase. Significant main effects of direction were found, with F-values exceeding the significance threshold around 84% of the stance phase. During this period, greater moments were observed in the backhand lunge compared to the forehand lunge. Significant interaction effects between gender and direction were observed for frontal (Fig.7) and transverse (Fig.8) knee moments during the stance phase. The F-values exceeded the significance threshold approximately between 60% and 68% of the stance phase in the frontal plane and between 65% and 68% of the stance phase in the transverse plane. During this interval, knee moments differed significantly between male and female players depending on the lunge direction.

This study collected kinematic and kinetic data from male and female players during lunge landing. Our findings revealed significant interaction effects between lunge direction and gender in both the secondary GRF peak and knee transverse plane moments, demonstrating that the biomechanical characteristics of badminton front-court lunges are direction-dependent and sex-specific. These results extend previous literature by highlighting the critical need for sex-differentiated strategies in injury prevention and performance optimization among amateur badminton players.

The study by Kuntze et al. indicated that when performing a lunge with a length of 1.5 times the length of the lower limb, the maximum vertical reaction force was the second peak of the VGRF curve [4]. This result is consistent with the present study and also consistent with the conclusion of the study by Nielsen et al. [9]. Nielsen et al. analyzed the movement characteristics of the lower limb joints during the forehand and backhand lunges of athletes in a 1.5-fold lower limb long stride, and obtained the first peak of VGRF (1.97 ± 0.28BW) and the maximum VGRF (2.18 ± 0.25BW), which were both greater than the results of this experiment. This may be related to the differences in the subjects’ athletic level. The subjects of this experiment were male and female amateur badminton players. It is worth noting that this study found that the second peak of the VGRF curve of women was significantly higher than that of men during the forehand lunge, suggesting that women are subjected to greater vertical impact loads during this movement. During the landing movement, high vertical and horizontal impact forces will cause higher joint moments in the lower limb ligaments, and these forces are considered to be factors in the injury of the anterior cruciate ligament [31]. This suggests that a larger ground reaction force may be a potential factor leading to ACL injury in the knee joint. People with a larger GRF peak in the same sport may be at high risk of ACL non-contact injury. This study also found that the second impact of both men and women during the forehand lunge was significantly higher than that during the backhand lunge. Chen et al. believed that the larger parameters of the forehand during landing can be attributed to the additional force generated during braking and deceleration [32]. This shows that although the forehand generates a larger impact force, the impact force buffering capacity is relatively strong.

The backhand lunge on the left and the forehand lunge on the right are the two key lunge directions in badminton. When athletes perform lunges in these two directions, they need to fully contract the lower limb muscles to provide sufficient kinetic energy for displacement. Compared with the forehand lunge, the backhand lunge also requires more trunk rotation, more center of gravity control, and dynamic posture stability [33]. This biomechanical difference may lead to systematic differences in GRF characteristics between movements in different directions. The present study found that the ground reaction force impulse of male subjects during backhand lunge was higher than that during forehand lunge, which is consistent with the findings of Nielsen et al. on ground reaction force of badminton lunge in college-level male badminton players [9]. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the ground reaction force (GRF) impulse between forehand and backhand lunges in female players. This finding may reflect the greater involvement of neuromuscular control strategies, such as trunk stabilization and technical coordination, to maintain movement efficiency regardless of lunge direction. Specifically, Li et al. [32] demonstrated that core muscle activation and trunk kinematics contribute significantly to dynamic stability and force generation during backhand lunges, while Jiang et al. [33] reported that skill-dependent muscle activation patterns involve both lower limbs and core muscles, which together affect GRF profiles. Therefore, the integrated contribution of trunk and lower limb neuromuscular control may offset directional differences in lower limb force production, resulting in comparable GRF impulses across forehand and backhand lunges in females.

There is a significant difference in the direction of the maximum hip flexion angle: the player’s joint angle is smaller during the forehand lunge than the backhand lunge. This is consistent with previous research results, that is, the joint angle is larger during the backhand lunge, but the forehand lunge may place higher demands on joint stability due to the higher acceleration [7,34,35]. It is worth noting that the knee flexion angle is closely related to the ligament load. Chappell et al. found that when the knee flexion angle decreases, the angle between the patellar ligament and the tibia increases, resulting in an increase in the forward shear force of the quadriceps on the tibia and a decrease in the backward shear force of the hamstring muscle, which increases the load on the knee joint, especially the anterior cruciate ligament [36]. In order to recover quickly from the lunge, athletes showed smaller knee and hip flexion angles, which was associated with shorter stance time [20].

The ROM is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. It is usually assessed during the lunge, shot, and recovery phases. A stable range of angle changes in the lower limb joints indicates stable cushioning during landing. A larger angle change difference increases the instability of the movement. The dorsiflexion of the ankle joint is an important factor in cushioning. Studies have found that when the ankle dorsiflexor muscles are fatigued, the performance of the lunge is significantly affected, and the strength of the ankle joint affects the kinematic characteristics of the knee joint [8,37]. If the ankle joint is unstable, the dorsiflexion range of the ankle joint and the flexion range of the knee joint will be reduced when landing, which is not conducive to the load generated by cushioning, because the ground reaction force will be smaller when the dorsiflexion range of motion is larger, and the dorsiflexion range of motion can also effectively reduce the load on the knee joint when landing. This study found that the ankle ROM during the forehand lunge was significantly higher than that during the backhand lunge, indicating that the probability of knee injury during the forehand lunge is lower than that during the backhand lunge.

Joint moment reflects the comprehensive effect and movement trend of the muscles around the joints and is an important dynamic parameter for assessing joint load and injury risk. As the main joint for energy absorption in the lower limbs, the peak moment of the knee joint can reveal the rotation characteristics of the joint during the stepping action. This study found that in different lunge directions, there were significant differences in knee abduction moment and external rotation moment at the peak VGRF between male and female players, while there was no significant difference in flexion and extension moment. This result may be related to the differentiated requirements of different stepping directions on the coordination pattern of the lower limb movement chain. For example, Fu et al. [16]pointed out that high-level athletes tend to generate greater moment in the sagittal and frontal planes to optimize movement efficiency, while lower-level athletes show higher horizontal plane reversal moment, suggesting that horizontal plane moment may be a potential dynamic factor affecting sports performance.

As shown in the results, the knee abduction moment of male and female players was greater during the forehand lunge than during the backhand lunge. From a biomechanical perspective, the increased knee valgus angle and moment have been associated with elevated ACL loading and are recognized as important risk factors for non-contact ACL injuries in various sporting tasks [38]. During the initial stage of lunge landing, the ACL’s capacity to resist valgus moments is limited, potentially increasing its susceptibility to excessive loading. In the present study, the observed increase in knee abduction moment during the forehand lunge suggests a potential elevation in ACL loading. However, it should be noted that there is currently no direct evidence linking forehand or backhand lunges with non-contact ACL injuries. Therefore, further studies incorporating both biomechanical analysis and injury surveillance are warranted to elucidate the relationship between lunge mechanics and ACL injury risk. Nonetheless, these findings highlight the importance of maintaining adequate frontal plane knee stability during forehand lunges to reduce potential ACL loading and injury risk. In daily training, the foot posture adjustment strategy proposed by Wang et al. [39] may serve as a valuable reference for optimizing lunge mechanics. In particular, increasing the foot progression angle can align the ground reaction force (GRF) vector closer to the knee joint center, thereby reducing the moment arm and the resulting knee abduction moment. This strategy has been proven to effectively decrease the coupling effect of ankle varus moment and knee adduction moment in gait intervention for patients with knee osteoarthritis, and may be extended to the optimization of badminton lunge technique.

In addition, the biomechanical complexity of the movement pattern needs to be taken seriously. Shimokochi et al. also confirmed that when the knee joint is subjected to complex loads while performing multi-plane movements at the same time, it is easy to cause non-contact ACL injury [40], such as combined knee internal rotation, knee hyperextension or small flexion angle combined with knee external rotation during knee valgus; during the push-off landing phase, the strong contraction of the quadriceps may further increase the ACL tension by increasing the anterior tibial shear force and internal rotation moment. Therefore, designing special footwork patterns for different lunge directions (forehand/backhand), such as adjusting the foot position, trunk rotation angle or knee flexion range at landing, may optimize the load distribution by changing the transmission path of multi-joint moment [40]. This view echoes the findings of Kuntze [4]: compared with a single push-off, the shorter contact time and smaller flexion and extension moment peak in multiple repetitive movements suggest that athletes can reduce the cumulative load on joints through dynamic adjustment of neuromuscular control strategies.

Non-contact Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries occur more frequently in tasks such as single-leg landing, side cutting or rapid turning, especially after the initial foot contact, when the higher ground reaction force will produce a higher impact load on the human body. Studies have shown that moderate impact force promotes bone growth and development, but excessive impact load is closely related to lower limb injuries [41,42]. Repetitive high-impact loading is considered a major risk factor for sports injuries such as tendinopathy, anterior cruciate ligament injury, stress fractures, and patellofemoral pain syndrome [43]. Lam et al. [15] explored the characteristics of the impact load on the lower limbs of badminton players when performing high-intensity lunges. After classification by gender and skill level, the results showed that the impact load of the ground reaction force of male and unskilled athletes was significantly higher than that of female and skilled athletes, suggesting that they face a higher risk of overuse injuries, that is, the peak vertical and horizontal GRFs produced by professional athletes are significantly smaller, and the load rate is mainly controlled by gender. This is also consistent with the results of this study. The impact load of the ground reaction force of male athletes when performing forehand lunges and backhand lunges is significantly higher than that of female athletes, suggesting that men may be subjected to greater impact loads when lunging, thereby increasing the potential risk of knee joint injury. The observed gender-related variations in mechanical performance during specific directional movements among amateur players potentially influenced by differences in neuromuscular control strategies; however, further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism. This finding provides a biomechanical basis for the design of gender-specific training intervention programs.

During the landing process of the lunge, the lower limb joints buffer the impact of the ground through various mechanisms, including increasing joint mobility, pre-adjusting joint angles, pre-regulating muscle activation patterns [44,45], and using joints to absorb energy [46]. Previous studies [47] have found that poor body posture at the moment when the lower limbs come into contact with the ground is an important cause of sports injuries. This study found that at the moment of lunge landing, the hip flexion angle of the supporting leg of male athletes was significantly smaller than that of female athletes, while the dorsiflexion angle of the ankle was significantly greater than that of female athletes. This difference may be related to the stronger muscle strength and neuromuscular control ability of men [48]. In addition, there was no significant difference in the lower limb hip, knee and ankle joint angles of men and women in the lunge direction at the initial landing moment. In this study, males had significantly higher knee flexion angles and range of motion at the moment of maximum cushioning during the lunge than females. This strategy may be related to differences in neuromuscular control between genders. Huang et al. [49] found that increasing sagittal plane movement and reducing frontal and transverse plane movement during lunge can prevent recurrence of knee pain. After the knee extensor and trunk control were improved, athletes showed better center of gravity change and balance ability. However, some studies have shown that excessive flexion of the knee joint not only causes damage to the cruciate ligament of the knee joint, but also increases the risk of injury to the collateral ligament and meniscus [16]. Related studies have confirmed that lower limb muscle activity (such as quadriceps, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, etc.) is directly related to sagittal plane movement of the knee joint, suggesting that badminton coaches should reasonably arrange lower limb muscle strength training for athletes according to gender differences, which may be beneficial to improve athletes’ knee control ability during stepping, improve athletes’ stepping technique, and reduce the risk of knee injury [50].

Several limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting the findings. First, the lunge tasks were performed in a controlled laboratory environment, which may not fully capture the dynamic and unpredictable conditions experienced during actual gameplay. In real match settings, lunges are often executed in response to unforeseen scenarios, requiring rapid adjustments. To enhance ecological validity, future research should consider the use of wearable sensor technologies, which would enable more accurate biomechanical assessments in real-world sports environments and under unanticipated movement conditions. Second, the participant cohort consisted exclusively of university amateur badminton players. Previous studies have demonstrated that athletes of different age groups and skill levels exhibit distinct motor strategies and biomechanical profiles [51]. Therefore, future investigations should aim to include a more diverse sample in terms of age and competitive experience. Third, the current study focused solely on the kinetic analysis of the knee joint, while excluding the hip and ankle joint moments. This was due to the primary aim of the study, which was to examine knee joint loading given its pivotal role in load absorption and injury mechanisms during lunges. However, this limited focus may restrict a comprehensive understanding of inter-joint coordination and the overall lower-limb loading pattern. Future studies should incorporate kinetic analyses of all major lower-limb joints to provide a more complete picture of lunge biomechanics.

The present study demonstrates distinct gender-specific biomechanical control strategies during forehand and backhand badminton lunges, with differential implications for injury risk across movement directions. Male athletes exhibited higher knee abduction moment and GRF impulse during backhand lunges, suggesting a reliance on lower limb strength dominance that may amplify joint loads in this direction. In contrast, females displayed greater vertical impact forces during forehand lunges, potentially linked to technical precision and trunk coordination compensating for reduced neuromuscular control efficiency. Notably, the forehand lunge posed elevated biomechanical risks for both genders: males showed pronounced knee valgus tendencies associated with frontal plane instability, while females experienced higher vertical GRF peaks. These direction-dependent disparities highlight the necessity of gender-tailored training interventions—emphasizing frontal plane stability control for males in forehand maneuvers and dynamic load distribution optimization for females in vertical impact mitigation. The findings collectively underscore that injury prevention frameworks must account for bidirectional biomechanical demands, integrating sex-specific neuromuscular adaptations to address asymmetric risks inherent in forehand versus backhand lunge techniques.
