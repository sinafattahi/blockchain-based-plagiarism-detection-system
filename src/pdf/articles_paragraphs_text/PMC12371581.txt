Dynamic systems, defined by their continuous temporal
evolution,
are central to advancements in chemistry, biology, and materials science.
Optical techniques that leverage light absorption, scattering, and
emission are essential for characterizing structural and property
changes in these systems. However, conventional optical toolssuch
as UV–vis spectroscopy, fluorescence, and scattering techniquesprovide
fragmented or incomplete insights, making it challenging to comprehensively
understand dynamic processes and ensure reliable data interpretation.
Herein, we introduce a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based multitrack
linearly polarized spectrometer (MLPS) designed for simultaneous kinetic
UV–vis, polarization-resolved scattering, and photoluminescence
measurements. The MLPS facilitates concurrent quantification of scattering
and fluorescence intensities and depolarizations, alongside UV–vis
extinction, with subsecond temporal resolution. By integrating high
temporal resolution with the ability to capture complementary spectra,
the MLPS significantly enhances the functionality of optical spectroscopy,
paving the way for broader applications in dynamic system analysis
and advancing research across multiple scientific disciplines. Furthermore,
the instrument characterization and data preprocessing methodologies
presented here provide valuable insights for the future development
of multitrack CCD-based spectrometers.

Optical spectroscopy serves
as a fundamental technique in chemical,
biological, and materials research, providing crucial insights into
material properties and their dynamic behaviors.−By exploiting
light–matter interactions, including absorption, scattering,
and emission, spectroscopic techniques such as UV–visible (UV–vis)
spectrophotometry, dynamic and static light scattering, and spectrofluorometry
have become indispensable tools across numerous scientific fields,
including nanotechnology, materials science, environmental science,
and biomedical diagnostics.−These methods are highly valued
due to their nondestructive nature, coupled with high spectral and
temporal resolution, and versatility across diverse experimental settings,
making them essential for both fundamental research and application
studies.

Collectively, these optical techniques provide substantial
information
on the photophysical properties and morphological characteristics
of materials. UV–vis absorption spectroscopy is commonly used
to determine optical bandgaps in semiconductors and elucidate electronic
states in organic dyes.−Dynamic light scattering (DLS), as a scattering-based
technique, is widely used to determine particle size distributions,−since scattering intensity and depolarization are highly sensitive
to a material’s size, shape, and aggregation state, making
them essential for characterizing nanoparticles, colloids, and complex
fluids, while polarized light scattering offers valuable insights
on shape anisotropy and molecular alignment in structured materials.−Fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used for investigating quantum
dots, fluorescent proteins, and molecular probes in imaging and sensing
applications.−Meanwhile, fluorescence depolarization, also known
as fluorescence anisotropy, provides insights into fluorophore rotational
mobility (rotational diffusion rate) and excited-state lifetimes,
information directly related to the molecular orientation, aggregation
behavior, and environmental interactions.−While individual
spectroscopic techniques provide valuable information, their inherent
limitations necessitate the integration of multiple optical methods
for a more comprehensive characterization of materials.−These approaches are effective for steady-state systems where sequential
measurements can be applied to the same system. However, it poses
challenges when addressing dynamic systems where the materials’
chemical, morphological, and photophysical properties vary over time.

The information deficiency with existing tools also compromises
the reliability of the data interpretation. One prominent example
is UV–vis spectrophotometry. While this popular tool measures
sample UV–vis extinction, it offers no insights into the signal
origins, absorption, scattering, or both of the latter.−A further complication is the cascading photomatter interactions
(CPMIs), the sequential photon–matter interactions triggered
by the same incident photon, that are ubiquitous in practical optical
spectroscopic applications.−With the only exception of a
small number of solutions that can be approximated as pure absorbers,
CPMI is inherent in other types of solutions including the ones that
can be approximated as pure scatterers, simultaneous absorbers and
scatterers, and simultaneous absorbers and emitters and those that
simultaneous absorb, scatter, and emit light. Example CPMIs include the absorption or rescattering of the scattered
light and the secondary fluorescence emission triggered by absorption
of primary fluorescence photons generated by the absorption of the
incident light. Such CPMIs drastically complicate the analysis of
the experimental data obtained with conventional optical tools,−often leading to ambiguous data interpretations.

To overcome
these limitations, we developed a charge-coupled device
(CCD)-based multitrack linearly polarized spectrometer (MLPS) that
employs free-space excitation and fiber-coupled spectral acquisition.
By design, this system enables simultaneous acquisition of four spectra:
a reference spectrum for monitoring the excitation intensity variation;
a forward spectrum that detects the excitation light passing through
the sample solutions; and two sideward linearly polarized spectra
differing in their detection polarization directions. This integrated
system enables concurrent quantification of the UV–vis extinction,
polarization-resolved scattering, and fluorescence intensities and
depolarizations, all with the same sample solutions with a subsecond
temporal resolution.

Herein, we focus on the MLPS instrument
design and characterization,
data preprocessing and analysis protocols, and a proof-of-concept
demonstration of the MLPS characterization of porphyrin self-assembly,
a dynamic system used for performance evaluation. CCD is widely utilized
in optical spectroscopy due to its high sensitivity, broad spectral
range and the ability to capture parallel spectral data efficiently.
To date, the CCD has been used for multitrack UV–vis,−fluorescence,−and polarization-resolved spectroscopic analysis.−However, to the best of our knowledge,
MLPS is the first spectroscopic tool enabling the concurrence of UV–vis
and polarization-resolved light scattering and fluorescence measurements.
While the CCD greatly expanded optical spectroscopy capabilities,
it has multiple challenges that can complicate the data analysis.
Such complications include cosmic spike interference, saturation limits due to CCD pixel well depth, and spectral
distortion due to differences in pixel responsivities. Additional
challenges for multitrack spectroscopic analysis include spectral
cross-talk and wavelength mismatches among the data obtained with
different spectral tracks.

Commercial CCD-based spectrometers
generally include built-in methods
for cosmic spike removal. Even though these methods work effectively
for single-pixel cosmic events, they fail when the cosmic spikes are
so intense that they bleed to several neighboring pixels. The upper-bound-spectrum
method is highly effective in identifying and removing cosmic spikes
with no assumption of the pixel width of the cosmic spikes, but it
requires multiple spectral acquisitions.−Therefore, this method is applicable
only to steady-state samples where the sample spectral features remain
constant during the sequential spectral acquisitions but not to dynamic
systems. To address this issue, a new time-domain cosmic spike removal
algorithm is developed herein in kinetic spectral acquisition (vide infra).

Schematic
representation of the spectrofluorometer-based LPRS/LPAOS
VV and VH spectral acquisition.

Despite its unique ability to provide previously unattainable
yet
crucial insights for materials characterization, the combined UV–vis,
LPRS, and LPAOS techniques suffer two critical limitations. The first
challenge is low data acquisition efficiency: acquiring a complete
data set requires two separate instruments and three sequential spectral
acquisitions, which can take 5 min or longer when the number of wavelength
data points exceeds 500. Such a poor efficiency makes real-time monitoring
in dynamic systems impractical.

The second challenge is ensuring
wavelength reproducibility across
spectra obtained from different instruments (UV–vis spectrophotometer
and fluorescence spectrophotometer) and under varied measurement conditions
(LPRS/LPAOS VV and VH).−Additionally, polarization reproducibility
presents a major concern in LPRS/LPAOS VV and VH spectral acquisitions.,Since the motorized monochromator and linear polarizer rely on stepper
motors for precise positioning, any inaccuracies in motorized control
can lead to misalignment in wavelength and polarization direction.
By multitrack design, MLPS drastically improves the temporal resolution
of the combined UV–vis and linearly polarized spectroscopic
measurements and effectively mitigates these reproducibility issues
because it enables the concurrent collection of UV–vis and
linearly polarized VV/VH data under identical measurement conditions,
eliminating inter-instrument and -measurement variations. A complete
list of abbreviations is provided in theSupporting Information.

Polystyrene
nanoparticles (PSNPs) with a nominal diameter of 200 nm were obtained
from Polysciences. Analytical grade anthracene, ovalene, compound
610 (C610), and Rhodamine B (RhB) solid blocks used for quantification
of the MLPS G-factor spectrum were purchased from Starna Scientific.
Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.meso-Tetrakis­(4-sulfonatophenyl)­porphyrin (TSPP) (Production
Number: A5013) was purchased from TCI America. Nanopure water (18.2
MΩ·cm) was used in solution preparation.

The self-assembly of TSPP was initiated according to the literature
procedure. In brief, 3 mL of 6 μM
TSPP in 0.01 M NaOH solution is placed in a quartz fluorescence cuvette
under constant stirring (1500 rpm). TSPP assembly is initiated by
rapidly adding 50 μL of 12 M HCl. Kinetic spectral acquisition
begins right before HCl addition. The assembly process was monitoredin situwith 3600 kinetic MLPS measurements, each with an
integration time of 0.5 s and a readout time of 0.15 s. As such, the
temporal resolution is 0.65 s. Notably, for faster processes, the
time resolution is expected to be 0.01 s by using an electron-multiplying
CCD (EMCCD). All spectra were collected at room temperature using
a 1 cm × 1 cm square fused quartz fluorescence cuvette (Thorlabs)
containing 3 mL of sample.

The schematic
and photograph of the MLPS instrument are shown inFigure. This instrument comprises
three main modules: a free-space excitation module, a sample compartment
module, and a fiber-coupled multitrack CCD spectrometer module.

(A) Schematic
and (B) photograph of the MLPS spectrometer. BS:
beam splitter; FC: fiber collimator; PH: pinhole; CCD: charge-coupled
device; LP: linear polarizer; FT: forward track; RT: reference track;
XV: sideward track with vertical polarization detection; XH: sideward
track with horizontal polarization detection.

The excitation module comprises a 300 W Xe lamp
and a 1/8 m monochromator
(Sciencetech TLS 72-X300) with adjustable slit width. The central
excitation wavelength can be changed from 300 nm to 1800 nm with an
accuracy of 0.3 nm. The output beam is collimated by a 50.8 mm diameter
lens (Lens1) with a focal length of 100 mm (Thorlabs LA4545), descended
by a periscope assembly (Thorlabs RS99), and further collimated with
lens 4 to a nonpolarizing beam splitter with a transmittance/reflectance
ratio of 90:10 (Thorlabs BS025). The transmitted portion (90%) passes
through a linear polarizer (LP1) (Thorlabs WP25M-UB), referred to
as the excitation polarizer hereafter, and then illuminates the sample.

The polarization direction of the excitation polarizer can be manually
rotated between horizontal (H) and vertical (V) orientations, with
the horizontal setting used to calibrate the instrument factor, i.e.,
the polarization-bias in the signal response or vertical (V) direction
for the polarization-resolved scattering and fluorescence spectral
acquisition (vide infra). The reflected portion (10%)
of the light from the monochromator is focused on one fiber designed
as the reference track.

The sample compartment module comprises
a Peltier-based temperature-controlled
cuvette holder with four optical ports, allowing the temperature to
vary from −15 to 100 °C (Quantum Northwest Luma 40) with
0.1 °C precision. Both the temperature and stirring speed can
be controlled and monitored with a commercial controller (Quantum
Northwest TC 1).

The fiber-coupled multitrack CCD spectrometer
module uses a seven-leg
fiber bundle (FiberTech Optica 7 × 200 μm high hydroxyl
ion fiber) for the spectral acquisition. All optical fibers are arranged
in a linear configuration at the end of the fibers connected to the
CCD spectrometer. Only alternative vertically arranged fibers (#1,
#3, #5, and #7) are used for data acquisition to mitigate the crosstalk
among the spectra collected with different tracks. Besides the reference
track used for monitoring excitation intensity variations, the other
three fibers used for collecting the optical signal generated from
the sample solution are designed for forward track and sideward XV
and XH tracks, respectively. While the forward detects light along
the propagation direction of the incident photons, the sideward tracks
collect photons propagating sideward from the direction of the incident
light. Sideward XV and XH tracks differ in the polarization direction
(V or H) of the linear polarizers placed in front of their respective
fiber coupler. X represents the direction of the excitation linear
polarizer that can be H or V depending on the measurement needs.

The photons collected with the four fiber tracks are dispersed
with a Czerny-Turner spectrograph with a 328 mm focal length (Andor
KYMERA-328I) and equipped with a 150
grooves/mm grating and a blaze wavelength of 500 nm. The dispersed
light is detected by a deep-cooled CCD camera with an image area of
26.6 × 6.6 mm or 1024 × 256 pixels (Andor iDus 420A-BEX2-DD)
and an operation temperature of −80 °C. When operating
with a central wavelength at 650 nm, this CCD spectrometer has a wavelength
coverage of 540 nm (from 380 to 920 nm) or an average of 0.52 nm/pixel.

The forward and sideward XV and sideward XH tracks are arranged
in a T-format configuration. A small pinhole (∼1.5 mm) and
a set of absorptive neutral density filters with an optical density
(OD) of 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 (Thorlabs NE10B-A, NE20B-A, NE50B-A) are
mounted in a cage filter wheel (Thorlabs CFW6/M) in front of the fiber
port for the forward track. The pinhole is critical for (a) mitigating
the interference of forward scattering light on UV–vis extinction
measurements and (b) reducing the signal
saturation of forward spectra at the excitation wavelength.

The two sideward signals are collected using 50.8 mm diameter lenses
(Lens2 and Lens3) with a focal length of 60 mm (Thorlabs LA4464) and
then pass through a linear polarizer (Thorlabs WP25M-UB) polarized
horizontally or vertically to the instrument plane defined by the
incident light, the sample holder, and the CCD spectrometer. Four
high numerical aperture (NA = 0.54) multimode fiber collimators (Thorlabs
F950SMA-A) are used for coupling the light into the fibers.

Experimental procedures and data for determination
of the CCD pixel binning for different spectral tracks are detailed
in theSupporting Information. A binning
size of nine CCD-pixel rows per spectral track was employed in the
MLPS measurements (Figure), which is determined by maximizing the spectral intensity
of each intended track while minimizing the spectral crosstalk between
signals collected from different optical fibers. The maximum crosstalk
under this configuration is less than 0.2% (Figure), as evaluated with the excitation wavelength
centered at 550 nm. This level of crosstalk is negligible for the
applications explored in this work. Further mitigation of crosstalk
can be achieved by reducing the spectral binning sizes, increasing
the distance of fibers used for different spectral tracks, and utilizing
optical fibers with smaller core diameters.

The dark signal of the CCD detector
was characterized by measuring the output signal from each pixel with
no incident light on the detector. At an operational temperature of
−80 °C, the measured dark current remained within 492
to 496 counts for each spectral wavelength. This dark current is independent
of the integration times from 0.05 to 2 s and the wavelength (Figure S1), indicating it is governed primarily
by CCD reset bias and readout noise. To
mitigate the interference of dark current in spectral analysis, a
constant dark signal of 492 counts was subtracted from the raw experimental
data prior to any data analysis.

Ensuring
high wavelength reproducibility across spectral tracks is crucial
for achieving accurate concurrent multispectral analysis in MLPS.
A mercury–argon light source (HG-2, Ocean Optics) is used to
calibrate the spectrometer wavelength. Optimizing the positioning
of the entrance end of the fiber bundle through a trial-and-error
approach resulted in a wavelength reproducibility of ±0.5 nm
among the MLPS spectral tracks (FigureA and B), as evaluated using
a set of single-band wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. Such
wavelength mismatch is smaller than the pixel wavelength resolution
(0.52 nm/pixel), highlighting the high precision of the fiber bundle
alignments. This level of wavelength reproducibility is sufficient
for most intended MLPS applications, as the spectral bandwidth of
UV–vis, scattering, and emission spectral features in photoactive
materials are typically much broader than, for example, 10 nm. The
high wavelength reproducibility allows the same wavelength calibration
curve (FigureC) to
be applied for four-track spectra, streamlining the data analysis.

four MLPS tracks

to 700 nm. The curves in red, blue, green, and black correspond to
the reference, forward, sideward XV, and sideward XH tracks, respectively.
The spectral intensity is arbitrarily scaled to facilitate the comparison.
(C) Detected wavelength calibrations as a function of excitation wavelength.

The sideward XH
and XV tracks in MLPS are designed to detect polarization-resolved
scattering and fluorescence intensities. The data acquired from individual
tracks are valuable for probing the sample’s scattering and
fluorescence intensity, and the ratio between VH vs VV enables quantification
of the scattering and fluorescence depolarizationsP(λ) (eq). These
two parameters are widely used in materials’ characterization,
as they provide crucial information on molecular orientation, structural
anisotropy, and dynamic interactions.

Normalizing the signal
responsivity of the two sideward tracks, which differ in detection
polarizations (H or V), is needed to ensure the accuracy in calculating
scattering and fluorescence depolarization. The signal normalization curve, MLPSG-factor spectrum,
is defined witheqand
experimentally quantified using the same method developed for determining
theG-factor spectrum (eq) for spectrofluorometer-based linearly polarized
spectroscopic measurements. Briefly,
a set of linearly polarized fluorescence (HV and HH) spectra is acquired
for multiple fluorescence solutions with overlapping emission wavelengths,
which collectively cover the wavelength range for the intended application. Since excitation light is H-polarized, the intensities
of H- and V-polarized fluorescence light detected 90 degrees relative
to the incident beam should be theoretically the same.,,As such, any observed signal
discrepancy between the sideward HH and HV spectra must be attributed
to the difference in signal responsivity between the two MLPS sidetracks,
corresponding to V and H detection polarizations, respectively.

The signal responses between the MLPS HV and HH signals are very
similar (FigureA–E), leading to a near-unity MLPSG-factor across the entire wavelength region (FigureF). In contrast, theG-factor
value of the conventional spectrofluorometer, which utilizes free-space
excitation and detection and has been extensively used in our previous
linearly polarized spectroscopic measurements, varies significantly,
ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 depending on the excitation wavelength.,,The stark difference in theG-factor spectra between the fiber-coupled MLPS instrument
and free-space commercial spectrofluorometer is likely due to the
depolarization effects of the multimode optical fibers used in the
MLPS setup.,While the gratings in the spectrofluorometer’s
detection monochromator and the MLPS CCD spectrometer likely have
a similar polarization bias, the 2 m multimode optical fibers in the
MLPS system effectively depolarize the light before it reaches the
CCD spectrometer. Regardless of its underlying causes, the near-unity
MLPSG-factor spectrum enables direct examination
of the degree of the scattering and fluorescence depolarization or
anisotropy.

The forward track is designed for quantification of solution UV–vis
extinction (eq). LDR
of MLPS-based UV–vis extinction quantification was evaluated
with two types of solutions, KMnO4as approximately pure
absorbers (FigureA and C) and PSNPs as approximately pure
light scatterers (FigureB and D). LDR of commercial UV–vis
spectrophotometers is typically evaluated using only solutions that
are pure absorbers. However, due to the inevitable interference of
forward light scattering, the upper limit of instrument LDR in terms
of scattering extinction is invariably lower than that in terms of
absorption extinction, or absorbance. As an example, for the commercial UV–vis spectrophotometer
used in this work, its upper LDR limit of the KMnO4absorbance
is about 5, while that for PSNPs depends strongly on the particle
sizes and becomes less than 3 for the same PSNPs (diameter 200 nm)
used in this work. Such a drastic difference
indicates the significance of the interference of forward scattering
light.

solution. Spectra in black are the solvent control. Correlation between
(C) MLPS UV–vis absorbance vs KMnO4absorbance and
(D) MLPS UV–vis scattering extinction and the theoretical scattering
extinction. The MLPS integration time is 0.5 s, and the central excitation
wavelength is 490 nm. The theoretical absorbance and scattering are
deduced from measurements with a commercial UV–vis spectrophotometer.

The upper LDR limit of MLPS-based UV–vis
measurement is
between 4 and 5 in terms of KMnO4absorbance, while that
for PNSP scattering extinction is below 4. The fact that MLPS has
a more-or-less similar LDR for absorption and scattering extinction
is due to the small, ∼1.5 mm, pinhole used in the design. Without
this pinhole, the MLPS LDR for KMnO4remains approximately
the same, while that for the PSNP scattering extinction is reduced
drastically to less than 0.5 (Figure S2). This observation is consistent with theoretical modeling that
predicts that the larger the detector collection angle, the lower
the upper limit of the UV–vis LDR for scattering solutions.

The comparable LDR of pinhole-equipped
MLPS for UV–vis absorption
and scattering extinction is particularly critical for investigating
the assembly and disassembly of photoactive materials. For instance,
dissolved molecular and dispersed ultrasmall nanoparticle chromophores
function primarily as pure absorbers. In contrast, their assembled
states serve as both absorbers and scatterers, with the ratio of scattering
to absorption intensity varying depending on the dynamics of assembly
and disassembly processes. To ensure the reliability of UV–vis
extinction measured with the current MLPS instrument, the sample design
should be such that its kinetic UV–vis extinction remains below
3 during the dynamic physicochemical processes where temporal variation
of solution scattering and absorption extinction ratio is unknown.

The MLPS UV–vis LDR discussed above was determined for kinetic
studies that require a fixed short integration time (0.5 s, in this
work). For steady-state solutions, MLPS UV–vis LDR can be extended
by establishing the excellent linear relationship between forward
spectral intensity and CCD integration time (Figure S3). To demonstrate this capability, KMnO4was used
as a model absorber; the upper LDR limit for MLPS UV–vis absorbance
was successfully extended to 5.6 by increasing the integration time
from 0.5 s for diluted solutions to 100 s for the most concentrated
KMnO4(Figure S4). By utilizing
longer integration times, MLPS can significantly extend the LDR limit
for UV–vis absorbance, making it advantageous for analyzing
highly concentrated samples and other materials that quickly exceed
the LDR of conventional spectroscopic instruments.

A universal complication
with CCD-based spectral acquisition is cosmic spike interference,
which appears as random spectral peaks caused by electromagnetic radiation,
such as γ rays originating from space.FigureA shows the as-acquired kinetic sideward
VH spectra obtained from TSPP assembly solutions triggered by addition
of HCl. Multiple cosmic spikes are present in the kinetic data, including
two particularly intense ones that dominate the spectra.

(A) As-acquired
kinetic MLPS VH spectra, (B) an example of the
time-domain cosmic spike removal, and (C) cosmic-spike-removed MLPS
VH spectra. Insets show the spectral dips. (D) The data after cosmic
spike removal followed by spectral dip correction.

While manual identification and removal of cosmic
spikes may be
feasible for small data sets, it becomes challenging for large-scale
spectral acquisitions and unsuitable for dynamic systems where spectral
properties evolve over time. For steady-state applications, such as
Raman imaging, where it involves multiple CCD spectra for the same
sample, an upper-bound spectrum method can be applied for automatic
cosmic spike identification and removal. Since the cosmic events are random in time and space (across CCD
pixels), the cosmic spikes can be statistically identified as outliers
in the spectral series. Once detected, the identified cosmic spike
intensity is replaced with an upper-bound intensity estimated based
on the statistics of the spectra taken with the same sample. However, this approach is unsuitable for dynamic
systems, where the sample optical property changes over time.

In this work, a MATLAB program (Figure S5) is developed for cosmic spike removal in the TSPP assembly kinetic
spectra. The method is termed as time-domain cosmic spike removal,
as it involves two assumptions for the time-course of signal intensity
at specific wavelength pixels. The first is that the probability of
a cosmic spike occurring at a specific pixel across three consecutive
temporal points is negligibly small. The second assumption is that
the spectral intensity changes in three consecutive temporal points
can be approximated as linear. Based on these assumptions, a temporal
signal is deemed to be a cosmic spike if its dark-current-corrected
intensity is 25% higher than the average signal of its two adjacent
temporal points. In this case, the spike intensity is replaced with
the average of the neighboring temporal points. As shown inFigureB and C, this cosmic spike removal method effectively eliminates
all detected cosmic spikes while preserving the integrity of the kinetic
spectral data. Moreover, it takes less than 30 s to process and remove
the cosmic spikes from all 3600 spectra.

The first assumption
is valid for most kinetic MLPS measurements,
provided the spectral integration time is short (e.g., <10 s),
as cosmic ray radiation is a relatively rare event. However, the validity
of the second assumption is sample-dependent and more critically influenced
by the temporal resolutions of the kinetic MLPS measurements. High
temporal resolution is required for dynamic systems, where rapid changes
in photophysical properties occur.

Besides
cosmic spikes, another artifact in as-acquired MLPS data is spectral
dips, which refer to the lower-than-expected spectral intensity (FigureC). Unlike cosmic
spikes, which appear randomly in time, spectral wavelength, or CCD
pixels, spectra dips are wavelength- or pixel-specific and consistently
occur at the same wavelength in every kinetic spectrum.

Empirical
observations indicate that the maximum dip intensity is approximately
30 counts, and the dip pattern and intensity are independent of spectral
integration time and the sample solution (Figure S6). These observations exclude the possibility of quantum
efficiency between neighboring pixels. Otherwise, the dip magnitude
would be proportional to the spectral integration time. Despite efforts
to understand mechanisms including communication with the CCD vendor,
the origin of these fixed-pattern and -magnitude artifacts remains
unclear. Since the spectral dips are within the shot noise when the
CCD signal is high (e.g., ≥10,000), they are essentially invisible
in spectra with high intensities. For low-intensity measurements,
such as the sidetrack MLPS spectra obtained with high temporal resolution,
it is essential to remove the spectral dips before performing data
analysis.

A MATLAB program for wavelength-domain correction
of the spectral
dips is developed by the empirical observation that most spectral
dips are separated by one or more CCD wavelength pixels (Figure S7). This software identifies the spectral
feature as a dip if its intensity is more than 25% lower than the
average intensity of its neighboring wavelength pixels (one on each
side). The effectiveness of the spectral dip removal is demonstrated
in the zoomed-in kinetic spectra shown inFigureD. Note that as the spectral dips are fixed-wavelength
artifacts with a relatively constant temporal magnitude, the presence
of the dips has no effect on the temporal-domain cosmic spike identification
and removal. However, cosmic spikes can complicate the wavelength-domain
dip correction. Therefore, cosmic spike removal should be performed
prior to spectral dip correction to ensure reliable spectral preprocessing.

The versatility and multispectral
capabilities of the MLPS instrument are demonstrated within situmonitoring of TSPP self-assembly using two excitation
wavelengths: 490 and 665 nm (Figure). The reference spectra for these kinetic MLPS measurements
demonstrate excellent excitation power stability (Figure S8). These two excitation wavelengths are chosen based
on TSPP optical properties under these excitation conditions. The
490 nm peak in UV–vis and resonance synchronous spectra is
a characteristic spectral feature of TSPP assembly formation, as TSPP
assemblies exhibit strong light scattering at this wavelength.−However, the absorption and fluorescence activities of TSPP assemblies
at this excitation wavelength have not been systematically characterized,
especially in TSPP assembly processes. Moreover, the TSPP assembly
exhibits UV–vis activities at 665 nm. However, the mechanistic
origin of UV–vis extinction at this wavelengthabsorption,
scattering, or bothremains unknown.

The insets are the zoomed-in features in the plotted wavelength
regions. Red, solvent; dark blue, before HCl addition; light blue
and pink, the first and last kinetic spectra; gray, the ones taken
in between.

The MLPS data provide previously unattainable insights
that are
essential for evidence-based spectral data analysis. It unequivocally
demonstrates that TSPP assemblies are simultaneous light absorbers
and scatterers but not an ORF emitter under 490 nm excitation, while
they concurrently absorb, scatter, and emit, all at 650 nm excitation.
Therefore, their UV–vis extinction should be interpreted as
the sum of absorption and scattering extinction. The absorption activities
at 490 nm wavelength are evident by the Stokes-shifted fluorescence
(SSF) observed in the 600 to 750 nm spectral region, while its scattering
activity is confirmed by the strong sideward VV and VH intensities
at 490 nm (FigureC, E). ORF activity at 490 nm is excluded
by the absence of anti-Stokes-shifted fluorescence (ASSF) in the VV
and VH spectra under 490 nm excitation, as ORF invariably appears
together with ASSF and SSF.

In
contrast, at 665 nm excitation, MLPS VV and VH spectra exhibit
ASSF, ORF, and SSF emission, confirming that the TSPP assembly is
both a light absorber and an ORF emitter at this wavelength. The 650
nm peak in the TSPP VV spectra indicates that TSPP is also a light
scatterer at this wavelength (FigureD). Traditionally, ORF is often misinterpreted as a
sample’s light scattering because both occur at the excitation
wavelength. The data obtained with 665 nm excitation reveal that the
ORF and scattering have comparable intensities in the VV spectra (FigureD), but the VH signal
at the excitation wavelength is dominated by the ORF with no significant
scattering contribution (FigureF).

The kinetic MLPS data enable simultaneous
quantification of TSPP
UV–vis extinction at the excitation wavelengths (FigureA and B), polarization-resolved scattering (FigureC and D), and fluorescence
emission intensities (FigureE and F). Additionally, it allows
for the calculation of scattering and fluorescence depolarizations
(FigureG and H) by usingeq, all with a temporal resolution of 0.65 s. Obtaining similar
information using combined UV–vis spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric
measurements would require at least 5 min at each temporal point,
showing that the MLPS spectrometer offers a more than 400-fold improvement
in temporal resolution. While the correlation between the structural
evolution of TSPP assemblies and the kinetics of MLPS spectral features
requires further investigation, the proof-of-concept application presented
here demonstrates MLPS’s potential to revolutionize optical
spectroscopic studies of dynamic systems, where existing optical tools
remain inadequate.

This work introduces and
characterizes a multitrack linearly polarized
spectrometer (MLPS), a CCD-based optical system designed for simultaneous
kinetic UV–vis, scattering, and photoluminescence measurements
with high temporal resolution. Unlike conventional optical spectroscopic
tools that often deliver fragmented data, MLPS enables the concurrent
quantification of UV–vis extinction, polarization-resolved
scattering, and fluorescence intensities, as well as scattering and
fluorescence depolarizations, thereby overcoming limitations in studying
dynamic systems. By integrating fiber-coupled spectral acquisition,
polarization-resolved detection, and a multitrack CCD sensor, MLPS
allows for a more comprehensive and accurate spectral analysis than
was previously possible. The MLPS system’s performance was
evaluated through a series of benchmarking experiments, comparing
it to commercial UV–vis spectrophotometers and spectrofluorometers.
The results demonstrate that MLPS achieves wavelength reproducibility
better than 0.5 nm across the 400–700 nm range, which is sufficient
precision for most photoactive material studies. Additionally, the
system shows near-unity responsivity between its two sideward polarization
tracks, significantly minimizing polarization bias and enabling accurate
scattering and fluorescence depolarization measurements. The application
of a newly developed cosmic spike removal algorithm further enhances
the reliability of kinetic spectral acquisitions, making the MLPS
particularly suited for studying rapid photophysical processes. A
key demonstration of MLPS’s capabilities involved the real-time
monitoring of porphyrin self-assembly, where its high temporal resolution
(subsecond) provided unprecedented insights into the structural and
optical evolution of dynamic molecular systems. Beyond its demonstrated
applications, the MLPS framework has the potential to significantly
advance research in nanomaterials, biointerfaces, and photophysics,
where precise, time-resolved optical characterization is critical.
Future optimizations may include extending the spectral range, improving
the temporal resolution, and integrating real-time corrections for
spectral distortions. Overall, this study establishes MLPS as a powerful
and versatile tool for next-generation optical spectroscopy, paving
the way for more accurate and holistic investigations of dynamic material
systems. Additionally, the instrument characterization and data preprocessing
techniques presented here provide valuable insights into the development
of future multitrack CCD-based spectrometers.
