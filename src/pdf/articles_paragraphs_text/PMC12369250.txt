The global burden of stroke among women of reproductive age is of significant concern. We aimed to leverage the Global Burden of Disease 2021 (GBD 2021) to estimate the prevalence, Years Lived with Disability (YLDs), and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rates for pathological types of strokes in women of reproductive age, as well as to examine their association with the sociodemographic index (SDI).

We utilized stroke data for women of reproductive age from 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The Annual Percentage Change (APC) was calculated, and the Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) was estimated to analyze trends in the burden of stroke. APC was used to measure the change in indicators over specific time intervals, assisting in describing the annual average rate of change in disease trends or other health metrics, and thereby providing insights into the direction and magnitude of disease burden changes. AAPC, typically derived as the weighted average of APC over a period, was used to assess long-term trends in time-series data, reflecting the overall trend while mitigating the influence of short-term fluctuations. This approach provides a solid basis for disease burden research and public health policy making. Additionally, the study explored the impact of risk factors for different pathological types on DALYs rates across various age groups and the 27 GBD super-regions. Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05. The analyses were conducted using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software and R 4.4.2.

The overall burden of stroke in women of reproductive age worldwide shows a downward trend, with the prevalence rate of AAPC at -0.22, YLDs rate of AAPC at -0.33, and DALYs rate of AAPC at -1.27. However, the prevalence of ischemic stroke showed an upward trend, with an AAPC of 0.08. In 2021, the Nauru region bore the highest burden of stroke in women of reproductive age, with prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs rates reaching 1,223.56 (95% UI: 1,180.50 to 1,271.92), 241.44 (95% UI: 173.40 to 311.30), and 2,646.68 (95% UI: 1,977.34 to 3,663.05), respectively. Our analysis revealed that the indicators for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) generally declined over time and with increasing SDI values, whereas the burden of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) initially increased before decreasing. When analyzing different age groups, we found that the burden of stroke in women of reproductive age increases with age. Between 1990 and 2021, the stroke burden decreased across all age groups within the reproductive years. The 15–19 age group exhibited the most significant decrease in prevalence rate, with an AAPC of -0.59; the 20–24 age group showed the most notable decline in YLDs rate, with an AAPC of -0.87; and the 35–39 age group experienced the largest reduction in DALYs rate, with an AAPC of -1.82. We identified 23 risk factors associated with stroke-related DALYs in reproductive-aged women. Compared with 1990, the strength of the associations between metabolic risk factors and stroke-related disability-adjusted life years was greater in 2021, with "High systolic blood pressure" and "High LDL cholesterol" demonstrating the most pronounced links. Moreover, trend analyses from 1990 to 2021 indicated that the associations of "Diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages" (AAPC = 2.33), "High body-mass index" (AAPC = 1.81), "High temperature" (AAPC = 0.77), and "High fasting plasma glucose" (AAPC = 0.51) with stroke-related DALY rates increased significantly over time. "Ambient particulate matter pollution" did not exhibit a statistically significant association, and the remaining seventeen risk factors showed declining trends in their associations.

While the global burden of stroke in women of reproductive age has decreased, significant burdens remain in certain regions and age groups compounded by multiple risk factors. Understanding these trends will help to guide future policy recommendations aimed at alleviating the associated burden.

Women of reproductive age are a key group for social, economic, and health development. They play important roles in reproduction, health, education, and social security. As the core of population reproduction, reproductive health directly affects the population structure and social stability. Their health status not only affects their quality of life but also has a profound effect on the growth of the next generation and social welfare [1].

According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019, stroke was the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of death and disability worldwide in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the burden (in terms of absolute number of cases) increased significantly [2]. Although stroke primarily affects the elderly, its incidence and consequences in women of reproductive age should be considered.

Studies indicate that the risk of stroke markedly increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period, driven primarily by physiological alterations in coagulation and hemodynamics, an intensified hypercoagulable state, and blood pressure fluctuations [3,4]. Complications, such as preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes, further damage the vascular endothelium [5]. Elevated levels of pregnancy hormones can disrupt vasomotor function, rendering vessels more susceptible to spasms or rupture [6]. Concurrently, the increased cardiovascular workload in pregnancy- or pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy may promote intracardiac thrombus formation and subsequent embolization [7]. Additionally, coexisting risk factors, such as advanced maternal age, obesity, smoking, and a family history of thrombosis, alongside suboptimal management of delivery and postpartum recovery, can exacerbate blood pressure instability and coagulopathy, collectively heightening stroke risk [8]. Stroke is a major cause of disability in women, potentially leading to the loss of motor, speech, and cognitive function, which in turn affects their quality of life [7,9].

In this study, we systematically evaluated the burden and temporal trends of stroke and its major subtypes among women of reproductive age using the GBD 2021, thereby elucidating the global distribution and scale of this public health challenge. We estimated the prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for overall stroke, as well as for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) at global, regional, and national levels. Additionally, we quantified stroke-related DALY rates associated with behavioral, environmental/occupational, and metabolic risk factors stratified by age group over the period 1990–2021. By comprehensively analyzing the burdens of various risk factors across geographic regions and stroke subtypes, this study provides a robust evidence base for healthcare planning, preventive strategy development, and resource allocation, and offers critical insights for the design of targeted interventions for women of reproductive age.

The inclusion criteria, literature search strategy, and data extraction methods for GBD 2021 have been thoroughly described in previous publications [10,11]. According to the WHO clinical standards, stroke is defined as a sudden onset of neurological dysfunction, typically localized, with symptoms lasting more than 24 h or leading to death. Ischemic stroke refers to neurological impairment resulting from a localized infarction in the brain, spinal cord, or retina. ICH is characterized by the presence of hematoma within the brain that is not caused by trauma. SAH refers to a non-traumatic stroke marked by bleeding in the subarachnoid space [12,13]. In the GBD classification, disease causes are organized into four hierarchical levels, ranging from broad categories to more specific conditions. Stroke is classified as a Level 3 disease under the broader Level 2 category of cardiovascular diseases, with its subtypes categorized as Level 4 diseases [2].

The modeling methods for non-fatal diseases in GBD 2021 have been extensively detailed in previous studies. The estimation of stroke prevalence, YLDs, and DALY rates employed DisMod-MR 2.1 tool [14]. DisMod-MR is a Bayesian geospatial disease modeling software that utilizes a range of disease parameters, epidemiological relationships among these parameters, and geospatial factors to generate prevalence and incidence estimates [15]. In this study, we incorporated all available high-quality data, including prevalence, YLDs, and DALY rates, to assess the burden of non-fatal strokes. In GBD 2021, ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH were modeled separately for the first 28 days from symptom onset, with distinct modeling for prevalence after the 28-day period [2]. For an in-depth account of the GBD 2021 modeling strategies, please refer to the Supplementary Materials.

In the GBD 2021 study, the regions were classified into 27 super-regions based on their epidemiological characteristics and geographical proximity. The sociodemographic Index (SDI) was assessed using three key indicators: per capita income, education level, and fertility rate. The SDI values ranged from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating higher levels of socioeconomic development. Based on the SDI, 204 countries and territories were grouped into five quintiles: high, high-middle, middle, low-middle, and low. For comprehensive details on the regional stratification criteria, please refer to the Supplementary Materials.

In addition to epidemiological indicators, such as prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs, the GBD 2021 analysis assessed the impact of 70 detailed risk factors on stroke burden, providing an in-depth examination of the specific roles played by these risk factors. This study focused on the DALYs associated with stroke and performed stratified analyses across different regions and age groups to highlight the variations in the effects of these risk factors in diverse populations. This stratified approach allows for a clearer understanding of how stroke burden shifts in different groups when exposed to similar risk factors.

GBD 2021 employed methods such as DisMod-MR 2.1 and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to quantify each risk factor's contribution to the stroke burden. This study established a theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) for each risk factor and calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) to estimate the potential reduction in stroke burden if these exposures are mitigated. Ultimately, this study integrates the calculations of risk‐related DALY burdens to provide robust evidence for the development of public health interventions.

In this study, we employed the Joinpoint regression analysis model, a widely used statistical method in epidemiological research, to assess the time trends of disease burden. Using this model, we analyzed time series data on the prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs rates for stroke, ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH in women of reproductive age at global, regional, and age-specific levels. The model identified significant change points and quantified temporal shifts in disease burden. The annual percentage change (APC) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to highlight the trend changes within specific periods. Additionally, to provide a comprehensive overview of long-term trends, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) was computed, covering data from 1990 to 2021. From a statistical standpoint, if the estimated APC or AAPC and its lower bound of the 95% CI are greater than zero, this suggests an increasing disease burden during that period. If the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than zero, it indicated a decreasing burden. When the 95% CI for APC or AAPC was zero, it may imply that no significant trend or statistical change was observed within that timeframe. A detailed description of the joinpoint regression analysis model is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

The prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs were represented as projections for every 100,000 people in the population, inclusive of 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). All procedures for analysis and graphical representation were performed usingJoinpoint Trend Analysis Software(https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/) andR version 4.4.2.

Between 1990 and 2021, the global burden of stroke in women of reproductive age generally declined. Specifically, the prevalence of ischemic stroke increased, the YLDs rate remained stable, and the DALYs rate increased. In contrast, the burden of ICH and SAH showed an overall downward trend (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2).

In 2021, the prevalence of stroke was 527.51 (95%UI: 486.94 to 564.65), with an AAPC of −0.22 (95%CI: −0.23 to −0.21). The YLDs rate was 83.89 (95%UI: 59.70 to 107.25), with an AAPC of −0.33 (95%CI: −0.37 to −0.30), and the DALYs rate was 432.28 (95%UI: 392.06 to 472.61), with an AAPC of −1.27 (95%CI: −1.30 to −1.23) (see Table1).

For ischemic stroke, the prevalence rate was 330.12 (95%UI: 294.61–364.87), with an AAPC of 0.08 (95%CI: 0.07 to 0.09). The YLDs rate was 51.79 (95%UI: 36.79 to 67.04), with an AAPC of 0.00 (95%CI: −0.02 to 0.03), and the DALYs rate was 103.77 (95%UI: 86.24 to 121.68), with an AAPC of −0.49 (95%CI: −0.52 to −0.45) (see Supplementary Table 1).

For ICH, the prevalence rate was 128.83 (95%UI: 115.55 to 143.89), with an AAPC of −0.83 (95%CI: −0.86 to −0.81). The YLDs rate was 21.00 (95%UI: 14.84 to 27.98), with an AAPC of −0.93 (95%CI: −0.99 to −0.85), and the DALYs rate was 258.64 (95%UI: 228.30 to 286.74), with an AAPC of −1.37 (95%CI: −1.42 to −1.33) (see Supplementary Table 2).

For SAH, the prevalence rate was 69.60 (95%UI: 62.39 to 78.02), with an AAPC of −0.41 (95%CI: −0.47 to −0.38). The YLDs rate was 11.09 (95%UI: 7.65 to 14.46), with an AAPC of −0.53 (95%CI: −0.59 to −0.47), and the DALYs rate was 69.86 (95%UI: 62.26 to 82.45), with an AAPC of −1.86 (95%CI: −1.89 to −1.83) (see Supplementary Table 3).

From 1990 to 2021, the stroke burden in women of reproductive age across the five SDI regions generally exhibited a declining trend. However, significant regional variations in stroke and related indicators were observed in 2021. Overall, the burden of stroke was the highest in the High-middle SDI regions and the lowest in the Low SDI regions, with the latter showing a pronounced decrease. Among the different stroke subtypes, ischemic stroke presented the highest burden in the High-middle SDI regions, whereas the most notable reductions in burden were observed for ICH and SAH in the Low SDI regions. The stroke-related DALYs rates across all SDI regions displayed a downward trend, with the High–middle SDI regions showing the most substantial reduction. Notably, the Low SDI regions experienced the most marked decrease in both prevalence and YLDs rates for ischemic stroke, whereas the other regions exhibited a general upward trend (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2).

In 2021, stroke indicators showed significant disparities between different SDI regions. The prevalence of stroke was highest in High-middle SDI regions (580.59, 95%UI: 532.15 to 624.36) and lowest in Low SDI regions (467.34, 95%UI: 438.79 to 497.32), with a notable downward trend observed in Low SDI regions (AAPC: −0.45, 95%CI: −0.46 to −0.45). The YLDs rate peaked in the High-middle SDI regions (106.57, 95%UI: 74.27 to 136.43) and was at its lowest in the Low SDI regions (63.82, 95UI: 46.04 to 81.09), with the most pronounced decline in the Low SDI regions (AAPC: −0.45, 95%CI: −0.50 to −0.42). The DALYs rate was highest in the Low-middle SDI regions (500.18, 95%UI: 446.86 to 559.40) and lowest in the High SDI regions (221.88, 95%UI: 199.22 to 246.92), with the most notable reduction occurring in High SDI regions (AAPC: −1.61, 95%CI: −1.63 to −1.57) (see Table1).

Please refer to the Supplementary Materials and Table1for detailed results on the burden of stroke subtypes across the five SDI and global regions.

Supplementary Fig. 3 illustrates the distribution of prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs rates for ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH across the 27 super-regions. In these regions, ischemic stroke accounted for the largest proportion of both the prevalence and YLDs rates. ICH contributed to the highest proportion of DALYs rates across most regions, highlighting a distinct trend from other stroke indicators.

We conducted an analysis of the burden of stroke, ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH, focusing on prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs rates across 204 countries and regions globally in 2021 (see Fig.1).

In 2021, we observed considerable regional variations in stroke burden indicators. Nauru had the highest prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs rates, with values of 1,223.56 (95% UI: 1,180.50 to 1,271.92), 241.44 (95% UI: 173.40 to 311.30), and 2,646.68 (95% UI: 1,977.34 to 3,663.05), respectively. Conversely, Switzerland exhibited the lowest prevalence and DALYs rates, at 287.78 (95% UI: 267.64–308.64) and 70.69 (95% UI: 57.65 to 83.30), respectively. Paraguay, on the other hand, had the lowest YLDs rate of 33.11 (95% UI: 23.89 to 43.01) (see Supplementary Table 4).

Please refer to Supplementary Materials for detailed results on the burden of stroke subtypes across 204 countries and territories.

We also explored the relationship between the SDI values and stroke burden indicators in 204 countries and regions from 1990 to 2021. These findings revealed that the burden of ischemic stroke and ICH generally decreased over time as well as with increasing SDI values. The burden of SAH exhibited a gradual increase with time and SDI values until it reached an SDI value of approximately 0.60, at which point it peaked. Following this peak, the burden began to decline as both the time and SDI values continued to increase (see Fig.2).

Comprehensive age-specific burden estimates for stroke and its subtypes are presented in Supplementary Materials. From 1990 to 2021, the overall burden of stroke in women of reproductive age has shown a clear downward trend. More specifically, the burden of ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH demonstrated declines across various indicators, with the most pronounced reductions occurring in the DALYs rates (see Supplementary Fig. 4).

The 15–24 age group experienced the most substantial reduction in stroke prevalence, with an AAPC of −0.59 (95%CI: −0.61 to −0.58). The 20–24 age group showed the most significant decline in the YLDs rate, with an AAPC of −0.87 (95%CI: −0.91 to −0.83). The 35–39 age group demonstrated the largest reduction in the DALYs rate, with an AAPC of −1.82 (95%CI: −1.85 to −1.79) (see Table1).

For ischemic stroke, the 20–24 age group showed the most notable decrease in both prevalence and YLDs rates, with AAPCs of −0.34 (95%CI: −0.36 to −0.33) and −0.57 (95%CI: −0.63 to −0.52), respectively. In comparison, the 45–49 age group exhibited the most significant decline in DALYs rate, with an AAPC of −1.03 (95%CI: −1.06 to −0.99) (see Supplementary Table 1).

In the analysis of ICH, the 45–49 age group had the most substantial decrease in prevalence rate, with an AAPC of −1.31 (95%CI: −1.35 to −1.29), while the 20–24 age group showed the greatest reduction in YLDs rate, with an AAPC of −1.44 (95%CI: −1.56 to −1.32). The 35–39 age group showed the most significant drop in DALYs rate, with an AAPC of −2.00 (95%CI: −2.03 to −1.97) (see Supplementary Table 2).

For SAH, the 45–49 age group displayed the most pronounced decrease in prevalence rate, with an AAPC of −0.82 (95%CI: −0.84 to −0.81), while the 20–24 age group experienced the largest reduction in YLDs rate, with an AAPC of −1.06 (95%CI: −1.20 to −0.88). The 35–39 age group showed the most significant drop in the DALYs rate, with an AAPC of −2.35 (95%CI: −2.40 to −2.31) (see Supplementary Table 3).

We found that, as age increased, the burden of various types of strokes also tended to increase. Among all stroke types, ischemic stroke exhibited the highest prevalence and YLDs rates in the same age group in 1990 and 2021, whereas SAH had the lowest prevalence and YLDs rates. Intriguingly, ICH consistently had the highest DALYs rate in the same age group across the same period, highlighting a distinct trend compared with the prevalence and YLDs rates (see Fig.3).

In 2021, 23 risk factors were related to the DALY rates of stroke and ischemic stroke, 17 risk factors were associated with the DALY rates of ICH, and 14 risk factors were linked to the DALY rates of SAH (see Fig.4). As age increased, the association between these risk factors and the DALY rates of stroke and its subtypes became progressively more pronounced, and the number of relevant risk factors also increased (see Fig.4).

Risk factors affecting stroke-related DALYs rates in women of reproductive age can be categorized into three main types: metabolic, environmental/occupational, and behavioral risks. Compared with 1990, among the three categories of risk factors, stroke-related DALYs associated with metabolic risks exhibited a continued upward trend, whereas those associated with environmental/occupational and behavioral risks showed a declining trajectory across 27 super-regions. This trend was also evident in the DALYs related to ischemic stroke, ICH, and SAH (Fig.5).

We analyzed the risk factors associated with stroke-related DALY rates in women of reproductive age from 1990 to 2021, along with trends in their attributable burden. The analysis revealed a significant upward trend in DALY rates linked to four specific risk factors over the period: "Diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages" (AAPC = 2.33), "High body-mass index"(AAPC = 1.81), "High temperature" (AAPC = 0.77), and "High fasting plasma glucose" (AAPC = 0.51). However, "ambient particulate matter pollution" did not have a statistically significant effect on the DALY rate. Seventeen other risk factors showed downward trends. Because of the inability of the Joinpoint software to handle negative values, analysis of the impact of "diet high in red meat" on the DALY rate was not conducted in this study (see Supplementary Table 5).

In women of reproductive age, "high systolic blood pressure" demonstrated the strongest association with DALY rates among all assessed risk factors for stroke, ICH, and SAH, with contributions of 177.67 (95% UI: 120.80 to 234.60), 108.93 (95% UI: 75.44 to 146.96), and 26.97 (95% UI: 18.16 to 36.75), respectively. "Diet high in red meat" was associated with the lowest stroke burden, with values of −28.66 (95% UI: −121.24 to 36.86), −21.56 (95% UI: −88.88 to 27.57), and −7.77 (95% UI: −32.18 to 9.97). "High LDL cholesterol" demonstrated the strongest association with DALY rates of ischemic stroke, with an estimated value of 51.58 (95% UI: 25.68 to 73.64), whereas"diet low in polyunsaturated fatty acids"was associated with the lowest stroke burden, with a value of 0.05 (95% UI: 0.02 to 0.08) (see Supplementary Table 6).

Similar patterns were observed in the 45–49 age group. The DALY rates for stroke, ICH, and SAH were strongly correlated with"high systolic blood pressure,"with values of 665.65 (95% UI: 882.12–465.50), 427.90 (95% UI: 573.32–301.72), and 87.78 (95% UI: 118.37 to 59.28), respectively."Diet high in red meat"was associated with a relatively minor association, with values of −76.82 (95% UI: 103.01 to −327.12), −61.77 (95% UI: 80.40 to −262.75), and −17.20 (95% UI: 23.48 to −70.54)."High LDL cholesterol"exhibited the strongest association with the burden of ischemic stroke–related DALYs, at 154.88 (95% UI: 74.22 to 221.02).

We observed substantial uncertainty in the DALY rates of different stroke subtypes associated with several risk factors, including the"diet high in red meat,""diet low in whole grains,""diet low in fiber,"and"lead exposure". The 95% UI for these risk factors encompassed zero, indicating that their effect on stroke DALY rates was ambiguous and likely lacked statistical significance.

In 2021, stroke remains the second leading cause of death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) globally after ischemic heart disease, and is ranked third in terms of DALYs, following ischemic heart disease and neonatal disorders. According to 2021 data, approximately 119 million people worldwide experience new cases of stroke, with ischemic stroke accounting for 65.3%, intracerebral hemorrhage for 28.8%, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for 5.8% [16]. Changes in the stroke burden among women of reproductive age reflect both advancements in global public health and gaps in disease prevention and control. Achieving sustainable health outcomes for this key population requires targeted intervention through multisectoral collaboration. This study, based on the 2021 global disease burden data, highlights the complex characteristics of stroke burden in women of reproductive age and provides essential guidance for future policy development.

Our research indicates that the global DALY rate for stroke in women of reproductive age has generally decreased, but significant differences remain across stroke subtypes. Over the past 30 years, the prevalence of ischemic stroke has steadily increased and is perhaps closely linked to the global rise in metabolic and behavioral risks [17–19]. Modern lifestyle factors, such as sedentary behavior and high sugar and fat diets, have led to a significant increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndromes, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, particularly among younger women. Issues such as poor diet and insufficient physical activity remain largely unaddressed, thereby increasing the risk of ischemic stroke [20]. However, the burden of ICH and SAH significantly decreased. Notably, the burden of SAH exhibited a rise-then-fall pattern with increasing SDI over time, which may be attributable to advancements in imaging technology. In the past, many SAH cases were undetected due to technical limitations, resulting in an underestimation of its burden. However, with advancements in society and the widespread adoption of imaging technologies, the diagnosis rate for SAH has improved substantially, leading to an increase in early case identification and reflecting a rise in burden [21,22]. As social development and health education have improved, there has been greater awareness of the early symptoms of acute diseases, such as stroke, prompting more people to seek medical attention early. Furthermore, improvements in healthcare have allowed more patients to receive timely diagnoses and treatments, increasing stroke case identification and cure rates, which has contributed to a decline in burden over time [23,24]. While these changes reflect progress in basic health services, there remains a need to strengthen the accessibility and quality of healthcare services further.

We found that although the overall stroke burden among women of reproductive age decreased significant disparities remained across different regions. The stroke burden was highest in Nauru. A study conducted in 2017 revealed that, as one of the countries with the highest obesity rates globally, approximately 70% of adults in Nauru are overweight or obese, and childhood obesity is a growing concern [25]. Obesity is closely linked to metabolic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for stroke [26,27]. Additionally, Nauru has a high smoking rate, with approximately 40%−50% of adults smoking, further exacerbating health issues [28,29]. As a small island nation with a population of approximately 10,000, Nauru has limited medical resources and a weak prevention system. Its capacity for chronic disease management and acute stroke treatment is insufficient, and there is a lack of early screening, thrombolytic therapy, and rehabilitation services, leading to worsened conditions and higher disability rates [30]. Switzerland had a relatively low stroke burden. According to Bridevaux PO's study, Swiss residents generally maintain a healthier diet, engage in regular physical exercise, and have lower smoking rates. Approximately 25% of Swiss adults smoke, with daily smokers accounting for approximately 20%, which is lower than that reported in many other European countries. The Swiss government implemented strict antismoking policies, raised tobacco taxes, restricted tobacco advertising, and launched widespread health education campaigns. Switzerland’s healthcare system is renowned for its ability to quickly identify and treat stroke risk factors, effectively reducing stroke prevalence [31]. Switzerland’s low poverty rate and stable socioeconomic conditions also ensure the equitable distribution of healthcare resources, helping to mitigate the negative impact of socioeconomic disparities on health.

In addition, although the stroke burden is relatively light in some High-SDI regions, such as Switzerland, it remains heavy in High-middle SDI regions, especially with stroke prevalence and YLD rates far exceeding the global average. Despite having abundant medical resources, these regions still experience a high stroke burden owing to behavioral factors such as high-calorie diets and high smoking rates, as well as a mismatch between lifestyle choices and the distribution of healthcare resources [32]. The Low SDI regions have experienced a decline in stroke prevalence and YLD rates, likely due to improvements in basic healthcare services and strengthened disease prevention measures. However, the rise in DALY rates indicates that disease management remains challenging in these regions, with a lack of medical resources and incomplete treatment preventing an effective reduction in disease risk [33]. We also observed that in regions such as Eastern Europe, Hadigh-income North America, and Southeast Asia, stroke prevalence has continued to rise over the past 30 years, particularly since 2019, when global prevalence and YLD rates began to increase. Differences in stroke burden across regions highlight the importance of targeted, country-specific strategies and policies. In Middle and High SDI regions, it is imperative to strengthen health education and actively promote healthy lifestyles, integrate cardiovascular risk assessment into routine prenatal care, and facilitate multidisciplinary consultations to provide precise interventions for high-risk groups, including advanced maternal ages and those with metabolic disorders. Concurrently, developed regions should extend technical assistance and share best practices with less-developed areas through physician training and public health initiatives, thereby reducing disparities in healthcare resources and bolstering comprehensive prevention and control efforts [34]. In Low SDI regions, it is essential to bolster the primary healthcare infrastructure and expand workforce training, equipping facilities with blood pressure monitors, and cardiovascular risk screening tools. The establishment of teleconsultation networks will ensure that high-risk women of reproductive age have prompt access to diagnostic and therapeutic services. Simultaneously, developing regional health information platforms to support data sharing and real-time surveillance will enable the timely identification of stroke hotspots and deployment of targeted outreach and health education programs [35,36].

Compared with 1990, stroke-related DALYs associated with metabolic risk factors were elevated in 2021, whereas those associated with environmental, occupational, and behavioral risks declined. The correlation between metabolic risk factors and ischemic stroke is especially pronounced [37]. As the stroke burden associated with metabolic risk factors increases, public health strategies should focus on improving metabolic health and adapting to changes in risk factors [38]. However, metabolic risk is closely associated with behavioral risk. For instance, metabolic issues such as high BMI, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure are often linked to unhealthy eating habits and behaviors such as smoking [39]. Therefore, key strategies for stroke prevention should target both metabolic risk control and behavioral improvements, including promoting healthy diets, managing weight, controlling blood sugar and blood pressure, increasing physical activity, and reducing smoking [40]. For example, in Finland, the government has worked with the food industry to reduce salt content in prepackaged and processed foods, launched public health campaigns, and implemented salt content standards and warning labels. These initiatives have effectively reduced the prevalence of hypertension and stroke, offering valuable insights into global public health policy [41]. While metabolic factors increasingly influence stroke burden, environmental and occupational factors should not be overlooked. Strengthening the environmental infrastructure, promoting clean energy, and implementing climate-resilient public health policies are essential [42].

The age-stratified analysis further highlights the dynamic characteristics of stroke burden in women of reproductive age. Overall, stroke burden increases with age, with the stroke-related DALY rate in the 45–49 age group (1261.8/100,000) being more than 10 times higher than in the 15–19 age group, emphasizing the long-term cumulative risk [43]. Although the stroke burden in the 35–49 age group has decreased, it still bears the greatest burden, especially among women aged 45–49, where the burden peaks, indicating the need for enhanced chronic disease prevention [44]. Among younger women (15–24 years), the YLDs rate has significantly improved, suggesting that current stroke prevention strategies are effective. To effectively mitigate the risk of stroke among women of reproductive age, age-specific intervention strategies should be implemented. For younger women, efforts should focus on enhancing health literacy through school- and community-based education programs, emphasizing smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and balanced nutrition to foster early awareness and prevention [45,46]. Among women aged 25–34 years, stroke prevention should be integrated into prenatal and postnatal care, with risk assessments tailored to conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. These individuals should receive personalized health management plans that include regular monitoring of blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight along with guidance on physical activity and dietary modifications. A more intensive approach is warranted for older women of reproductive age who face a heightened stroke risk. This includes risk stratification, establishment of dedicated health records, and enhanced screening for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions. When necessary, targeted counseling and timely interventions should be provided to ensure early detection and effective prevention [47].

Our study indicates that although stroke prevention strategies for women of reproductive age have made some progress, they are still insufficient to fully reduce the stroke burden. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement more effective stroke prevention strategies, particularly targeting key risk factors associated with stroke, especially"diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages","high body mass index","high temperature", and"high fasting plasma glucose."Furthermore, it is crucial to develop tailored policies and epidemiological monitoring systems based on the specific context of each region to facilitate targeted interventions [48]. If the promotion of innovative evidence-based strategies and policies is not intensified and inequalities in stroke prevention and care are not addressed, the stroke burden among women of reproductive age will continue, threatening the sustainability of global health systems. A key strength of this study is the expanded range of data sources, allowing us to provide more accurate and up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and its risk factors in women of reproductive age. This supports policymakers in making evidence-based health planning and resource allocation decisions at national, regional, and global levels.

This study had some limitations. First, high-quality epidemiological data on stroke remains scarce in many countries, hindering the accurate assessment of certain critical risk factors. For instance, current evidence suggests that the use of modern combined estrogen-progestin or progestin-only contraceptives elevates the risk of ischemic stroke. Moreover, post-stroke depression further exacerbates patient burden [49,50]. However, because GBD 2021 does not classify hormone use and psychological factors as independent risk factors, their specific contributions to stroke burden among women of reproductive age cannot be quantified, resulting in bias and confounding effects. This limitation diminishes the sensitivity of burden estimates to female-specific physiological and psychological characteristics and constrains the formulation of targeted strategies for hormone management and psychological interventions. Second, although the GBD study incorporates the cumulative effects of multiple risk factors when estimating attributable burdens, uncertainties remain regarding the associations between certain potential risk factors—such as"diet high in red meat,""diet low in whole grains,""diet low in fiber,"and"lead exposure"—and stroke-related DALYs. Further investigation is necessary to clarify their true impact on the stroke burden. Additionally, owing to insufficient monitoring data on risk factor exposures in some countries, estimates related to hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and other factors may deviate from reality, thereby impacting the accuracy of attributable burden analyses. Moreover, in many developing countries, limited diagnostic capacity, absence of high-quality population registries, and under-resourced healthcare systems may have led to misdiagnosis, underreporting, and missing data for stroke and its subtypes, resulting in an underestimation of the actual disease burden. Regional differences in diagnostic criteria and clinical practice may also cause misclassification of stroke types, further compromising data consistency and comparability. In situations where data are lacking, GBD 2021 relies on modeling estimates extrapolated from neighboring countries or regions with similar SDI levels, which may fail to capture local health risks and population characteristics, introducing model transfer errors. Finally, compared to GBD 2021, the forthcoming GBD 2023 incorporates several advancements in modeling and data collection: it replaces the DisMod-MR model with the more refined DisMod-AT model, enhancing the capture of cohort effects; employs a"waterfall"workflow for standardized processing, cross-cohort calibration, and cause-of-death adjustments, improving data consistency and transparency; introduces AI-driven verbal autopsy validation to enhance data accuracy in Low SDI regions; and applies spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) in non-fatal disease estimation, further refining estimates of inter-regional variation. Furthermore, GBD 2023 expands the inclusion of national cohort data, electronic health records (EHR), and mobile health data, thereby improving data comprehensiveness and timeliness. Risk factor estimates were also re-evaluated to recalibrate the relative risks and mediation effects. These improvements substantially increase estimation accuracy, offering more reliable evidence for public health decision-making [51].

It is important to note that this study relies on GBD 2021, which inherently involves a time lag and reflects epidemiological estimates only through 2021, limiting its representation of the most current conditions. Recent data were smoothed by modeling, which may obscure short-term fluctuations. Variations in data quality and reporting timeliness across SDI levels may also affect the direct comparisons between regions and age groups. Therefore, while GBD 2021 provides relatively precise estimates, it cannot fully substitute real-world data and requires continuous validation through subsequent studies and updated datasets.

We performed a systematic analysis of the burden of stroke and its subtypes among women aged 15–49 years across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, with additional stratification by age group. Overall, the stroke burden in reproductive-aged women declined markedly over this period, while the prevalence rate of ischemic stroke increased over the past three decades. Regional analyses revealed a strong correlation between stroke burden and the SDI. Age-stratified results showed that although the stroke burden increased with advancing age, all age cohorts experienced reductions from 1990 to 2021. Risk factor evaluation revealed that metabolic, behavioral, and environmental/occupational risks all contributed to stroke-related DALYs, with metabolic factors, particularly those associated with hypertension and obesity, exhibiting the strongest associations.
