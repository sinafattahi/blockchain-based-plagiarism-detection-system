Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for acute upper respiratory infections (URIs) despite limited evidence of their effectiveness, particularly in older individuals. Understanding the potential associations of such prescriptions with subsequent health outcomes is critical for clinical decision-making. This study investigated the association between antibiotic prescription and pneumonia diagnosis among older adults with acute URIs in the Republic of Korea.

We conducted a retrospective analysis using national health insurance claims data from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. The study included 5,898,239 prescription units from 3,059,864 patients aged ≥ 65 years diagnosed with acute URIs. Antibiotic prescription status, pneumonia diagnoses, and patient characteristics such as age, sex, and comorbidities were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with pneumonia diagnoses.

Of all prescription units analyzed, 34.4% included antibiotics. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 7.1% of all units, with a higher proportion in the antibiotic group (8.1%) than in the non-antibiotic group (6.6%). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, antibiotic prescription was associated with a 1.3-fold higher likelihood of pneumonia diagnosis. Higher odds of pneumonia were also observed in men, older individuals, and those with chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, cancer, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes.

Among older adults with acute URIs, antibiotic prescriptions were associated with a higher prevalence of pneumonia diagnoses. These findings highlight the importance of cautious antibiotic prescribing in this population and consideration of individual comorbidities.

Acute upper respiratory infections (URIs) are a major cause of acute illnesses worldwide and have a significant burden on healthcare [1,2]. URIs are typically caused by viruses with symptoms including cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Research has indicated that treatment of acute URIs with antibiotics does not significantly reduce the incidences of bacterial infection or complications [3–5]. Conversely, a few studies have suggested that immediate antibiotic administration may lower the pneumonia risk [6,7]. Therefore, judicious antibiotic prescription tailored to a patient’s clinical profile is crucial.

In the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, which explored the burdens of acute URI and acute otitis media across all age groups in 204 countries and territories, the acute URI incidence in 2021 was 162,484.8 per 100,000 population (144,834.0–183,289.4) worldwide, and the estimated number of deaths due to acute URI was 19,600, which corresponds to a mortality rate of 0.2 per 100,000 population (range 0.1–0.5) [2]. In a study that evaluated factors behind the increased medical spending in the Republic of Korea using data from 2010 to 2019, when the country’s aging population had been gradually increasing, total medical spending increased from $55 billion in 2010 to $92 billion in 2019, of which 35.6% was attributed to the aging population [8].

Numerous studies have analyzed antibiotic prescribing practices for acute URIs in pediatric and general adult populations [4,9–11]. However, evidence remains limited regarding older adults, particularly concerning the potential association between antibiotic use for acute URIs and subsequent complications such as pneumonia. This study aimed to examine the association between antibiotic prescriptions and pneumonia diagnoses among patients aged ≥ 65 years with acute URIs, using nationwide claims data. Given the limitations of observational data, the findings should be interpreted as correlational rather than causal.

This retrospective study used National Health Insurance claims data collected by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, a government agency responsible for reviewing healthcare services in the Republic of Korea. Data were collected from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 to avoid confounding effects from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Of the 93,626,474 claims related to acute URIs, 10,629,051 claims were identified for those aged ≥ 65 years. Patients with multiple visits during a defined period were grouped as a single prescription unit; based on this criterion, we analyzed 5,898,239 prescription units (Fig.1). The selected claims were categorized by the type of medical institution: primary, secondary, or tertiary.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (protocol code: 2022-027-001, April 21, 2022).

We selected diseases classified as acute URIs according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The analyzed conditions included acute nasopharyngitis (common cold) (J00), acute sinusitis (J01), acute pharyngitis (J02), acute tonsillitis (J03), acute laryngitis and tracheitis (J04), acute obstructive laryngitis and epiglottitis (J05), and acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites (J06). These were reported as the main diagnoses and the first through the fourth sub-diagnoses.

Each patient’s multiple healthcare visits for an acute URI were grouped into a single prescription unit, defined as a 30-day episode starting from the initial acute URI diagnosis date [9,10]. All medical claims, diagnoses, and prescriptions occurring within this 30-day window were included as part of the same episode. Antibiotic prescription status was identified within each episode, and pneumonia diagnoses were assessed across the full study period of 2018. This approach allowed us to evaluate whether pneumonia was more commonly diagnosed during the year in patients who had received antibiotics during acute URI episodes, without assuming a temporal or causal sequence.

We analyzed the prescription details for antibiotics and classified them as penicillin, cephalosporin (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or higher generation), macrolides, quinolones, and others, based on the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service drug benefit list and the Korea Food and Drug Administration classification.

Comorbidities were identified by ICD-10 codes for ischemic heart diseases (I20–I25), heart failure (I50), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (J43–J44, excluding J43.0), diabetes mellitus (E10–E14), and cancer (C00–C97), which are significant conditions often coexisting with pneumonia, and billed as the main and first four sub-diagnoses in the health insurance claim data.

The primary outcome, pneumonia diagnosis, was identified from the 2018 claims, billed as the main and first four sub-diagnoses with specific disease codes: viral pneumonia (J12), pneumonia due toStreptococcus pneumoniae(J13),Haemophilus influenzae(J14), bacterial pneumonia (J15), pneumonia due to other organisms (J16), pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere (J17), and unspecified organism (J18).

Descriptive statistics are used to describe the patient clinical characteristics. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to assess the association between antibiotic prescription and pneumonia. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with pneumonia diagnosis among patients with acute URIs. Multivariate logistic regression was then used to assess the association between antibiotic prescription and pneumonia diagnosis, with the results expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

A total of 3,059,864 patients with acute URI who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study, comprising 58.6% women and 41.4% men. Patients aged 65–75 years comprised 62.0% of the cohort, followed by those aged 75–85 years (32.6%); together they accounted for 94.6% of all the patients. Regarding healthcare providers, 88.7% patients utilized primary care, 10.9% secondary care, and 0.4% tertiary care. The most common medical specialty visit was to internal medicine physicians (33.6%), followed by general practitioners (28.2%) and otolaryngologists (24.9%) (Table1).

A total of 5,898,239 prescription units were identified for analyses including 59.3% women and 40.7% men, similar to the patient sex distribution. Regarding age distribution, 61.5% prescription units were for patients aged 65–75 years and 33.3% for those aged 75–85 years, accounting for 94.8% of all prescriptions analyzed (Table1).

The study analyzed 5,898,239 prescriptions for acute URI; 34.4% included antibiotics and 65.6% did not. Prescriptions with antibiotics were more common among those aged 65–75 years (65.6% vs. 59.4%), whereas those without antibiotics were more common among those aged 75–85 years (35.0% vs. 30.2%). Otolaryngology had higher antibiotic coverage than other medical specialties (Table2).

A total of 419,914 pneumonia cases (7.1%) were identified among the 5.9 million prescription units for acute URIs. The diagnosis of pneumonia was 8.1% among prescription units that included antibiotics, compared to 6.6% among those without antibiotic prescriptions. Among the outpatients, pneumonia diagnosis was significantly higher in the antibiotic-use group (7.2%) than in the antibiotic-free group (5.7%). Among the inpatients, no significant difference in pneumonia diagnosis was observed between the groups.

Based on the analysis of acute URI prescriptions, men had significantly higher pneumonia rates than women (44.7% vs. 40.4%,P< 0.0001). Individuals aged 65–74 years were more likely to be pneumonia-free, whereas pneumonia was more prevalent in those aged > 75 years (P< 0.0001).

Primary hospitals had more pneumonia-free patients, whereas secondary and tertiary hospitals had more pneumonia-combined patients (P< 0.0001). Pneumonia-free patients were more common in otolaryngology, general medicine, family medicine, and surgery, whereas internal medicine and other specialties had more pneumonia cases (P< 0 0.0001). Comorbidities such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and cancer were more prevalent in the pneumonia-combined group (P< 0.0001); antibiotic prescriptions were also significantly more common in this group (39.2%) (Table3).

A total of 2,028,669 antibiotic prescriptions, characterized by antibiotic classes, were analyzed. Penicillin derivatives, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, and other antibiotics were more common in the pneumonia-free group, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (17.0%), macrolides (18.2%), and quinolones (9.1%) were more prevalent in the pneumonia-combined group (Table4).

Among older adults (≥ 65 years) diagnosed with acute URIs, antibiotic prescription was associated with higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis, with an OR of 1.251 (95% CI, 1.243–1.259). Men had a higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis compared to women, with an OR of 1.192 (95% CI 1.184–1.199). The likelihood of pneumonia diagnosis increased progressively with age: OR 1.507 (95% CI 1.497–1.517) for patients aged 75–84 years, 2.284 (95% CI 2.257–2.311) for those aged 85–94 years, and 3.213 (95% CI 3.058–3.377) for those aged ≥ 95 years. Patients treated in secondary and tertiary care settings also had higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis compared to those treated in primary care, with ORs of 1.893 (95% CI 1.876–1.911) and 2.399 (95% CI 2.313–2.489), respectively. Internal medicine had the highest OR, 1.263 (95% CI 1.253–1.273), compared to otolaryngology, whereas surgery had the lowest at 0.961 (95% CI 0.940–0.982). Comorbidities such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, COPD, diabetes, and cancer increased odds of pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URI. Notably, COPD and heart failure showed the strongest associations, with ORs of 4.7 and 2.2, respectively (Table5).

We conducted a multivariate regression analysis to determine the association between antibiotic prescription and pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URIs after adjusting for variables significant in the univariate logistic regression such as sex, age, and comorbidities, including COPD and heart failure. Antibiotic prescription remained associated with a 1.3-fold higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URIs after adjusting for all significant variables (Table6).

In this study 34.4% of all prescription units for patients with acute URI contained antibiotics during a 1-year period in the population aged ≥ 65 years. Additionally, 7.1% of all acute URI prescription units were associated with pneumonia. A previous cohort study of 185,014 low-risk older patients with acute URIs indicated that antibiotics were prescribed in 46.0% of those patients, categorized as common colds, acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, or acute laryngitis [12]. Another prior claims data analysis revealed that among adults aged 20–75 years with acute URIs, the antibiotic prescription rate was 49.9% in 2008 and decreased to 39.0% in 2018 [13]. In that cohort, 35.1% of antibiotic-containing prescriptions were for acute URIs in the older demographic aged 65–75 years [13].

Previous cohort studies with the general population that documented pneumonia incidences and risk factors revealed men are 1.4 times more likely to develop pneumonia than women [14]. Several investigations noted a higher incidence of pneumonia in men compared to women, with older men having a particularly high risk [15–17]. This increased incidence of pneumonia in men persists even among those diagnosed with acute URIs. Our study, which focused on older patients with acute URIs, also showed that men had a higher likelihood (OR 1.192) of being diagnosed with pneumonia compared to women.

A Korean study that analyzed antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients with acute URIs reported the highest antibiotic prescription rate (95.8%) in primary clinics, with decreasing rates in secondary and tertiary hospitals. Pediatrics was the specialty in which the most antibiotics were prescribed, followed by internal medicine, otolaryngology, family medicine, and surgery [18]. In our study, primary hospitals accounted for 92.3% of all prescription units. Otolaryngology had the highest prescription rate among all medical specialties, followed by internal medicine, general medicine, family medicine, and surgery. These results are similar to those of a previous study with children; differences in medical specialties were possibly due to the different ages of the target population [18]. In that same study, antibiotics were prescribed in the following order among pediatric patients with acute URIs: penicillin derivatives, 2nd cephalosporins, macrolides, 3rd cephalosporins, and 1 st cephalosporins [18]. The same order was determined in our study, except that more quinolone antibiotics were prescribed than 1 st cephalosporins, which may reflect the limited use of quinolone antibiotics for children.

Considering that viral pathogens primarily cause acute URIs, antibiotics are generally ineffective, and their overuse can contribute to antimicrobial resistance [5]. Governmental efforts to manage resistance, such as Antimicrobial Stewardship campaigns and assessments of antibiotic prescribing appropriateness, have led to a decline in antibiotic prescribing rates [19]. Nonetheless, antibiotics are still prescribed for acute URIs, often to prevent potential clinical deterioration [20].

Unlike studies involving younger populations, relatively few investigations have evaluated the association between antibiotic prescriptions and specific clinical outcomes in older adults. A systematic review of patients with sore throats reported reductions in symptoms and suppurative complications among those prescribed antibiotics, although the sample size was limited [21]. Conversely, other studies have suggested that antibiotic use may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia [22] and higher incidence rates among patients frequently prescribed antibiotics [23]. One study reported that the odds of pneumonia were 1.26 times higher in those who received antibiotics [14]. In our study of older adults with acute URIs, antibiotic prescription was independently associated with higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis (OR = 1.30).

Our results differed from a retrospective cohort study of primary care patients in the United Kingdom, which investigated the relationship of the incidence of pneumonia and serious infectious diseases with antibiotic prescription, including conditions such as otitis media, lower respiratory tract infections, and URIs [3]. Although pneumonia incidence in patients aged ≥ 65 years prescribed antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections was relatively low 1 month later (1.5% vs. 4.0%) [3], our study observed a higher rate of pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URIs who received antibiotics (8.1% vs. 6.6%). This discordance may be due to differences in the inclusion criteria; that is, URIs versus lower respiratory tract infections.

COPD is a significant risk factor for pneumonia [24], with patients having a 2.18-fold increased risk compared to those without COPD [13]. Heart failure is also an independent risk factor, with a 4.11 times higher pneumonia risk [13,25]. Cancer was associated with a 2.18 times higher risk of combined pneumonia compared to individuals without cancer [13]. Similarly, we found that comorbidities such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, COPD, diabetes, and cancer were associated with higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URIs. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for underlying chronic conditions when assessing antibiotic use in this population and support the need for more cautious prescribing practices in older adults, who often present with multiple comorbidities.

This study has several limitations. First, in some cases of acute URIs, bacterial etiologies may warrant antibiotic treatment, and both antibiotic prescribing and pneumonia diagnoses may be more frequent among patients with more severe clinical presentations. However, because our analysis relied on administrative claims data, we were unable to capture clinical details such as symptom severity or diagnostic confirmation to directly assess these factors. Second, pneumonia diagnoses were identified based on ICD-10 codes recorded at any point during the one-year study period, without confirmation that pneumonia events occurred after the URI episode. As such, the temporal sequence between URI diagnosis, antibiotic prescription, and pneumonia onset could not be definitively determined. This limitation restricts our ability to draw causal inferences from the observed associations. Third, although we assessed prescription records, we could not verify whether the prescribed antibiotics were actually dispensed or taken by the patients. Finally, important contextual factors such as smoking status, immunocompromised conditions, socioeconomic status, and characteristics related to healthcare providers were not available in the claims data. The absence of these variables may lead to residual confounding and limits the generalizability and interpretability of the findings.

We investigated the associations between clinical characteristics, antibiotic prescriptions, and comorbidities and the diagnosis of pneumonia among older adults with acute URIs using national health insurance claims data. Antibiotic use was associated with a higher likelihood of pneumonia diagnosis, although a causal relationship could not be established. By broadening the diagnostic criteria to include up to four sub-diagnoses, we improved case identification. These findings may inform future policies and clinical guidelines for appropriate antibiotic use in older adults with acute URIs.
