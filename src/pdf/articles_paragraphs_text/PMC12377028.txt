To investigate the role of PON1 in diabetic nephropathy and elucidate the
underlying mechanisms using a cellular model.

A diabetic nephropathy model was established using high glucose-induced HK-2
cells. Potential target genes and signaling pathways were identified through
bioinformatics databases, and PON1 expression was manipulated to interfere
with these pathways. The effects of different treatments on cell conditions
were systematically evaluated.

PON1, the targeted gene in diabetic nephropathy, was significantly
downregulated in high glucose-induced cells. The PPARγ signaling
pathway was identified as closely associated with PON1, with both
PPARα and PPARγ emerging as key regulators within this
pathway. We observed significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase
activity, malondialdehyde levels, and cell apoptosis, along with notable
decreases in superoxide dismutase levels, cell viability, and cell
proliferation, in the high glucose-treated group. Additionally, the
expression levels of PPARα and PPARγ were also decreased.
Overexpression of PON1 (pc-PON1) in the high glucose group mitigated these
effects, whereas treatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 reversed
the protective changes induced by pc-PON1.

Elevated PON1 levels mitigated oxidative stress and inhibited cell death,
thereby promoting cell growth and alleviating diabetic nephropathy through
activation of the PPARγ signaling pathway.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease globally
(1) and a significant
predictor of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients (2), serving as a primary microvascular
complication in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients (3,4). The hallmark pathological features of DN include glomerular
capillary damage, inflammation (5),
hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (6), among other risk factors contributing to its onset and
progression. Current interventions for DN include blood glucose management,
hypertension treatment, dyslipidemia management, smoking cessation, protein
restriction, and renal replacement therapy (7). Despite these measures, effective treatments for DN remain
limited. The emerging field of gene therapy offers a promising new approach for the
treatment of DN (8).

Research indicates that paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an enzyme primarily synthesized in the
liver and detected in the circulatory system (9), exhibits increased activity, which serves as a favorable
indicator in patients with T2DM (10). Elevated PON1 activity is beneficial for preventing
nephropathy in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and its
atherosclerotic complications (11). Furthermore, the PON1 polymorphisms L55M and Q192R have been
identified as genetic markers linked to the progression of DN (12), suggesting that PON1 may serve
as a potential biomarker for DN. Given that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in
the onset and progression of DN (13), animal studies indicate that increasing PON1 expression may
mitigate diabetes progression via its antioxidant properties (14), implying that increased PON1
expression may alleviate diabetes progression through antioxidative effects.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling
pathway plays a critical role in various biological processes, including metabolism,
inflammation, and cell differentiation (15). As a nuclear receptor, PPARγ regulates the
expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and adipocyte
formation (16). Research indicates
that modulating oxidative stress, proinflammatory factors, and the PPARγ
signaling pathway can mitigate cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetic rats
(17). Activation of the
PPARγ signaling pathway not only significantly influences the
pathophysiological mechanisms of type 2 diabetes (18) but also inhibits DN-induced apoptosis in
podocytes (19).

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PON1 in diabetic nephropathy and
elucidate the underlying mechanisms using a cellular model .

Primary antibodies targeting Bax (2772S), Bcl-2 (15071S), PON1 (9116S),
PPARα (74076S), PPARγ (2435S), and GAPDH (2118S) were acquired
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, USA). The kits utilized included an LDH
Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (C0017), a Total Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit with
WST-8 (S0101S), a Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) Assay Kit (S0131S), a Cell Counting
Kit-8 (C0038), and a TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit (C1088) obtained from Beyotime in
Beijing, China. Furthermore, the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 was procured
from MedChemExpress in Shanghai, China.

Cultured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), HK-2 cells
(RRID:CVCL_0302) were subcultured once every 5 days at a ratio of 1:3, and the
number of cells passaged in the experiment did not exceed 20 passages. They were
cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (SH30243.01, HyClone, USA) enriched
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 11011-8615, Tianhang, China) in a cell
incubator (BB150, Thermo Scientific, USA) adjusted to 37 °C with 5% carbon
dioxide (CO2). The intervention time for subsequent experiments was at the time
of exponential cell growth. To assess the effects of elevated glucose (high
glucose [HG]) levels, HK-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 4×105
cells/well in a 12-well plate and subsequently cultivated. Next, the cells were
exposed to serum-free medium comprising 20 mM glucose (HG) for 24 hours. Cells
displaying active growth and a trypan blue exclusion rate exceeding 95% were
selected for further experiments. Pc-PON1 and pc-negative control (pc-NC)
plasmids were obtained from GenePharma in Shanghai, China. Following HG
induction, HK-2 cells were transfected with 20 µmol/L pc-PON1 in the
presence or absence of 10 µM GW9662 via Lipofectamine®2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Subsequent to this intervention, cellular
analyses were conducted for operational evaluations, during which RNA and
protein samples were extracted to facilitate subsequent analyses by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) and Western blotting.

After being seeded at a density of 1 × 104, the cells were
placed in a 96-well plate and cultured in DMEM under 5% CO2at 37 °C.
After different treatments for 24 hours, cell proliferation was evaluated via a
CCK-8 kit (C0038, Beyotime, Beijing, China). At 450 nm, optical density (OD)
measurements were conducted using a microplate reader. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.

The cells were then incubated with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 minutes at 25 °C,
followed by imaging. Then, acetic acid (30%) was used to dissolve the crystal
violet solution for 15 minutes at 25 °C, and the OD value was detected via a
spectrophotometer at 590 nm. Three repeats were conducted in each
experiment.

DNA fragmentation was detected via a TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit (C1088, Beyotime,
Beijing, China). Initially, HK-2 cells (5×104) were placed in 96-well
plates (Corning Inc., Acton, MA, USA) and allowed to adhere overnight before
being subjected to various treatments for 24 hours in fresh complete medium. The
cells were subsequently subjected to TUNEL at 37 °C for 1 hour, followed by
rinsing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After the rinsing step, the HK-2
cells were subjected to diamidinyl phenyl indole (DAPI) treatment at 37 °C.
Subsequently, apoptosis in the cells was observed through a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus P40; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The trials were repeated three
times.

The malondialdehyde (MDA) assay kit (S0131S) and the superoxide dismutase (SOD)
assay kit (S0101S) sourced from Beyotime in Beijing, China, were used to
evaluate the MDA and SOD levels within the cells. Following the manufacturer’s
guidelines, the OD at 525 nm was measured for each well.

The examination of cellular cytotoxicity was conducted utilizing the LDH
Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (C0017, Beyotime, Beijing, China) in accordance with the
guidelines outlined by the manufacturer. Following the designated course of
treatment and incubation, the culture supernatant was blended with the substrate
mixture and incubated in a dark environment at room temperature for 30 minutes.
The reaction was catalyzed by introducing the stop solution, and absorbance
measurements were conducted at 490 nm utilizing a microplate reader. The results
are presented as a ratio in comparison with the maximum lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) discharge activity demonstrated by the cells.

The identified targets were those linked to DN sourced from DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/home/), GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/), and the Comparative Toxicogenomics
Database (CTD;http://ctdbase.org/). The search query utilized centered on
“diabetic nephropathy”, concentrating exclusively on the human species.

The enrichment of the signaling pathway of PON1 in DN patients in comparison with
healthy controls was analyzed via the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) database. A screening condition of FDR <0.05 was applied, and the
visualization of the signaling pathway enrichment outcomes was conducted using
the GOplot R package.

Following the manufacturer’s guidelines, RNA was extracted from cells via the use
of TRIzol reagent (Beyotime, Beijing, China). The extracted RNA was then
utilized for cDNA synthesis (Beyotime, Beijing, China). Subsequently, PCR was
conducted on an ABI 7900 fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument (ABI, USA).
The primer sequences designed and synthesized by General Biology (Anhui) were as
follows: PON1 (human): F-5’-CACGACTTAATGCTCTCCG-3’ and
R-5’-CAGAGCCAGTTTCGATTCC-3’; GAPDH (human): F-5’-TCAAGATCATCAGCAATGCC-3’ and
R-5’-CGATACCAAAGTTGTCATGGA-3’. The primer concentration used per sample was 0.2
µM. The initial denaturation stage lasted 10 minutes at 95 °C, after
which 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 seconds, annealing at 52.8 °C or
56.2 °C for 15 seconds, and extension at 72 °C for 20 seconds were performed.
The temperature gradient ranged from 72 to 95 °C, increasing by increments of 1
°C per step, and the gain calibration was automatically set before the first
run. Standardization of mRNA expression was achieved through normalization to
GAPDH expression via a modified 2-∆∆ CTcalculation method.

The cells from the different groups were collected, washed in PBS, and lysed with
lysis buffer (RIPA buffer, BR0002, Best Biological; PMSF, G2008, Servicebio;
protease inhibitor, BL612A, Biosharp). Total protein was extracted and
quantified via a BCA assay (P0012, Beyotime, China). The acquired protein was
transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and subsequently blocked with
5% skim milk. The primary antibodies were subsequently added to the PVDF
membrane, which was incubated at 4 °C overnight. For the cell samples, the PVDF
membranes were exposed to primary antibodies against Bax (20 kDa, 2772S,
1:1000), Bcl-2 (26 kDa, 15071S, 1:1000), PON1 (34 kDa, 9116S, 1:1000),
PPARα (52 kDa, ab126285, 1:1000), PPARγ (58 kDa, ab178860,
1:1000), and GAPDH (37 kDa, 2118S, 1:2000) during the incubation phase. All
primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, USA), except
for PPARα and PPARγ, which were from Abcam. The membranes were
subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody (A0201, 1:2000, Beyotime,
Beijing, China). Enhanced chemiluminescence was employed for visualization of
the protein bands, with GAPDH used as the internal reference protein.
Densitometric assessment of the protein levels mentioned above was conducted via
ImageJ (V1.8.0, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).

Data analysis was carried out using SPSS Statistics (Version 20, Chicago, IL,
USA). The continuous data were averaged, with both addition and subtraction
procedures applied, and the standard deviation was then computed. To evaluate
the differences between two groups, attest was performed. For
scenarios involving three or more groups, one-way analisys of variance (Anova)
paired with an least significant difference was employed. A significant
distinction between a pair of groups was defined asp <0.05.

The activity of LDH and the levels of SOD and MDA were measured using commercial
kits from Beyotime (Beijing, China). In HK-2 cells treated with high glucose
(HG), LDH activity and MDA levels significantly increased (p < 0.001),
whereas SOD levels markedly decreased (p < 0.001) (Figures 1Ato1C). Cell viability
and proliferation were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay and colony formation
assay, respectively, whereas apoptosis was assessed via the TUNEL assay. We
observed a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation (p <
0.001;Figures 1Dans1E), along with an increase in apoptosis (p < 0.05;Figures 1FandG). This increase was accompanied by increased Bax expression
and reduced Bcl-2 expression (p < 0.001;Figure 1H). Collectively, these findings indicate that HG
treatment induced oxidative stress and cellular damage in HK-2 cells.

Using the CTD, DisGeNET, and GeneCards databases, a comprehensive investigation
was conducted to identify genes associated with DN. A total of 13 genes were
identified from these databases, with PON1 emerging as the key target gene, as
shown inFigure 2A. Subsequent
analyses via real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to evaluate PON1
expression in HG-induced HK-2 cells compared with that in the control group. The
results demonstrated that in HG-induced HK-2 cells, both the mRNA (p < 0.01;Figure 2B) and protein
(p < 0.001;Figure 2C)
levels of PON1 were significantly reduced, indicating potential downregulation
of the PON1 gene in DN.

Following transfection with pc-PON1, significant upregulation of PON1 expression
was observed in HG-induced HK-2 cells, as evidenced by real-time PCR and Western
blot analyses (p < 0.01;Figures
3Ato3B), confirming the successful
overexpression of PON1 in thein vitroDN model. Compared with
the HG+pc-NC group, transfection with pc-PON1 resulted in decreased LDH (p <
0.01) activity and MDA levels (p < 0.001) but increased SOD levels (p <
0.01) in HG-induced HK-2 cells (Figures
3Cto3E). Additionally, cell viability and
proliferation were significantly enhanced (p < 0.001;Figures 3Fand3G),
accompanied by reduced apoptosis (p < 0.05;Figure 3H). This effect was associated with
decreased Bax expression (p < 0.001) and increased Bcl-2 levels (p <
0.001) in HG-induced HK-2 cells transfected with pc-PON1 (Figure 3I). Collectively, these
findings indicate that PON1 overexpression effectively mitigates HG-induced
oxidative stress and cellular damage in HK-2 cells.

Through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, the PPARγ signaling pathway
emerged as the most significant pathway associated with PON1 (Figure 4A). We subsequently
examined the expression levels of two key proteins within this pathway,
PPARα and PPARγ, via Western blot analysis. As shown inFigure 4B, HG-induced
HK-2 cells presented significantly reduced levels of both PPARα and
PPARγ (p < 0.001). However, transfection with pc-PON1 partially
restored their expression levels (p < 0.001), whereas treatment with GW9662,
a PPARγ antagonist, further decreased these levels (p < 0.01). These
findings suggest that PON1 overexpression can activate the PPARγ
signaling pathway in HG-treated HK-2 cells.

Further investigations were conducted to elucidate the role of the PPARγ
signaling pathway in mediating the effects of PON1 overexpression on DN. As
shown inFigures 5Ato5C, compared with those in the
HG+pc-NC group, the levels of LDH and MDA (p < 0.05) and the SOD content (p
< 0.01) were significantly lower in the HG+pc-PON1 group. These changes were
reversed by GW9662 treatment (p < 0.05). Additionally, cell viability and
proliferation were markedly enhanced (p < 0.01), whereas apoptosis was
reduced (p < 0.05) in the HG+pc-PON1 group, as evidenced by decreased Bax
expression (p < 0.001) and increased Bcl-2 levels (p < 0.001). However,
these alterations were reversed by GW9662 (p < 0.05) (Figures 5Dto5G).
Collectively, these findings suggest that upregulation of the PON1 gene can
alleviate oxidative stress and cellular damage in HG-induced HK-2 cells via
activation of the PPARγ signaling pathway.

DN, characterized by cellular damage in renal cells induced by oxidative stress, is a
serious complication of diabetes mellitus (20). Our results demonstrated that exposure of HK-2 cells to
HG led to increased LDH activity and MDA levels, indicative of cellular damage and
lipid peroxidation, respectively. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in SOD
content, indicating impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms in response to
HG-induced oxidative stress. These findings are consistent with previous studies
showing similar changes in oxidative stress markers in renal cells exposed to
hyperglycemic conditions (21,22). Moreover, we observed a
significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation, along with an increase in
apoptosis, in HG-treated HK-2 cells. The dysregulation of apoptosis-related
proteins, characterized by increased Bax levels and decreased Bcl-2 expression,
further substantiates the induction of cellular damage and apoptosis in response to
high glucose exposure. These findings are consistent with previous studies
demonstrating the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on cell survival and
apoptosis in renal cells (23).

A substantial body of research has consistently shown that PON1, which has reduced
activity in both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM patients, plays a critical
role in glucose metabolism and homeostasis and is functionally involved in beta-cell
insulin secretion (24). Through
bioinformatics analysis, this study identified PON1 as a key target gene associated
with DN and revealed that in HG-induced HK-2 cells, PON1 expression was markedly
downregulated, suggesting a potential role of PON1 downregulation in the
pathogenesis of DN. This downregulation of the PON1 gene under high-glucose
conditions aligns with previous research linking reduced PON1 expression to
increased oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic conditions (25). To investigate the therapeutic
potential of PON1 in DN, we conducted overexpression experiments in HK-2 cells
exposed to high glucose. Our results demonstrated that the upregulation of the PON1
gene led to a significant reduction in LDH activity and MDA levels, whereas the SOD
content increased. These changes indicate the restoration of redox balance and the
mitigation of oxidative stress-induced damage. Consistent with previous studies, our
findings support the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of PON1 across
various disease states, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (26,27). Additionally, PON1 overexpression resulted in increased
cell viability and proliferation, along with reduced apoptosis, in the HG group.
This effect was further supported by the modulation of apoptosis-related proteins,
characterized by decreased Bax expression and increased Bcl-2 levels, reinforcing
the protective role of PON1 against the cellular damage and apoptosis induced by
elevated glucose levels. These results align with studies demonstrating the
cytoprotective effects of PON1 under oxidative stress conditions in different cell
types (28). Studies in
PON1-deficient mice have demonstrated that PON1 deficiency results in significantly
elevated lipid peroxide concentrations and markers of oxidative stress and decreased
glycolysis, Krebs cycle activity, and urea cycle function. Additionally, pathways
involved in triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis are markedly upregulated,
whereas the pyrimidine cycle significantly increases orotate levels (29). These metabolic alterations
collectively impact diabetes pathogenesis, suggesting that PON1 may influence
diabetes through a more systemic mechanism. Consequently, further research is
warranted to explore the potential of targeting PON1 for diabetes treatment.

Previous studies have revealed several potential PPARα binding sites in the
PON1 gene promoter. However, the hypolipidemic drug fibrates did not cause changes
in PON1 gene expression after activating PPARα. Nevertheless, rosiglitazone,
a PPARγ agonist that can improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in
patients with type 2 diabetes, was found to increase PON1 activity, although there
was no significant change in the serum PON1 concentration (30). Additionally, antioxidant
polyphenols obtained from some plants can increase PON1 expression by activating
PPARγ (31), suggesting a
strong correlation between PPARγ and PON1 in diabetes. This investigation
explored the involvement of the PPARγ signaling pathway in mediating the
protective effects of PON1 in the HG group and revealed that the upregulation of the
PON1 gene activated the PPARγ signaling cascade, as evidenced by the
restoration of PPARα and PPARγ levels in HK-2 cells under high-glucose
conditions. These findings suggest that PON1 may exert its protective functions by
modulating the PPARγ signaling pathway, a critical mechanism regulating
oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular viability in various disease contexts
(32,33). Further research is warranted to investigate the
therapeutic potential of PON1 and its downstream signaling pathways in managing
DN.

In summary, this study examined the impact of elevated glucose on oxidative stress
and cellular injury in HK-2 cells, a commonly used proximal tubular cell line.
Additionally, the role of PON1 in mitigating these effects through activation of the
PPARγ signaling pathway was explored. Our study elucidates the essential role
of PON1 in mitigating oxidative stress and cellular damage in HK-2 cells induced by
high glucose, which is achieved through activation of the PPARγ signaling
cascade. These results not only increase our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying DN but also identify PON1 as a potential therapeutic target
for reducing renal injury in diabetic patients.
