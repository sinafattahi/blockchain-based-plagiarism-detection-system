Contracture recurrence is a common setback to burn reconstruction, especially for severe or large‐area contractures. Flap‐based burn reconstruction has been shown to result in lower recurrent contracture rates. This study aims to summarize and evaluate the outcomes of flap‐based techniques used for post‐burn joint contracture reconstruction.

A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Databases searched included PUBMED, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Articles that described the use of flaps with a known blood supply to reconstruct post‐burn contractures of the joints were included. Studies with incomplete data, with multiple anatomic site contracture involvement, case reports, and non‐English articles were excluded. Data on patient demographics, flap type, complications, and contracture resolution were extracted. A proportional meta‐analysis was conducted using the DerSimonian and Laird random‐effects model.

Out of 850 studies screened, 27 met inclusion criteria. Reconstruction of 830 joint contractures was reported. Contractures resolved for 98.9% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 97.7–99.6]) of pedicled and 90.1% (I2= 82.8% [95% CI: 62.7–100]) of free flap reconstructions, recurring in 1.8% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 0.7–3.3]) at sites reconstructed with pedicled flaps and 0.6% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 0.1–1.7]) at sites reconstructed with free flaps. The rates of flap complications were low, with total flap loss reported at 1.5% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]) and 2.9% (I2= 37.9% [95% CI: 0.9–5.8]) of the time for pedicled and free flaps, respectively. Partial flap loss was 6.9% (I2= 65.1% [95% CI: 3.4–11.5]) and 5.2% (I2= 65% [95% CI: 1.7–10.4]) for pedicled and free flaps, respectively. No significant difference was identified in rates of contracture resolution (p= 0.50), contracture recurrence (p= 0.15), total flap loss (p= 0.18) or partial flap loss (p= 0.31) regardless of the flap type used.

Burn contracture reconstruction using flap‐based techniques shows minimal complications and low rates of contracture recurrence when used for joints. Pedicled and free flap reconstruction of burn contracture sites yield similar outcomes.

Burn contracture is a devastating sequela of burn injury, carrying morbidity for the recovering patient, while also being clinically challenging to correct, requiring an armory of reconstructive skills. Development of post‐burn contracture after a major burn has been reported to be as high as 43%; however, this may vary across treatment facilities depending on the type of burn care and resources available to patient (Kowalske et al.2003; Schneider et al.2006). This can be devastating to patients' ability to perform activities of daily living, especially in the setting of joint contractures which inhibit range of motion (Ma et al.2021). Schneider et al. reported an incidence rate of 38% for shoulder contractures, 34% for elbow contractures, and 22% for knee contractures following acute burn surgery (Schneider et al.2006). Following initial burn contracture release, recurrence has been estimated to be up to 70%, with the highest recurrences reported for joint contractures (Liu et al.2024; Balumuka et al.2015; Carmichael et al.2005). Identification of successful burn contracture reconstruction techniques for joints is necessary to improve patient morbidity and prevent contracture recurrence.

A successful approach for burn contracture management relies on a thorough understanding of the reconstructive ladder and an appropriate, individualized surgical plan for each patient. Although skin grafts are widely used for burn reconstruction, these are associated with higher contracture rates (Maitani et al.2021). Local tissue rearrangements may be an effective reconstructive method when healthy nearby tissue is available, but the utility is limited in instances of large or severe burns that necessitate tissue reconstruction using a reliable blood supply. (Verhaegen et al.2011; Hayashida and Akita2017) Burn contracture repair using flap‐based reconstruction has been associated with lower rates of re‐contracture comparatively; but it requires a higher technical skill level of the surgeon and can increase morbidity risk for the patient (Verhaegen et al.2011; Hayashida and Akita2017).

To date, a summary of the current literature that addresses flap‐based reconstruction of post‐burn joint contractures and assessment of the outcomes is not available. We sought to effectively summarize the current literature on this topic with an anatomically based approach to aid burn reconstruction surgeons in choosing the appropriate reconstructive method. We chose to refine our search further by specifically focusing on joint contractures and ensured that included studies had objective measurements for improvement, including data that reported range of motion outcomes. We hypothesized that flap‐based reconstruction of post‐burn joint contractures would yield low recurrence across joint types, regardless of the flap type used.

Articles that were included in this study described the flap‐based repair of a burn contracture that crossed a joint. We defined flap‐based reconstruction as the use of flaps with a blood supply from a named vessel, including free and pedicled flaps. All relevant case series and cohort studies were included. Studies with incomplete data, studies that included contractures that involved two distinct anatomic sites or those that did not involve a joint, studies not written in the English language, case reports, and studies involving contracture repair with local tissue rearrangements without an axial blood supply were excluded.

Screening was independently conducted using Covidence systematic review software by two independent authors (A.E and L.R.M.), and conflicts were resolved by consensus and adjudication by the senior author (J.E.J.), if needed. Results from the initial search were compiled, with duplicate studies removed. After title and abstract screening, full‐length articles were reviewed with reasons provided for each exclusion. The selected articles were reviewed, and data describing the authors of the study, year of publication, type of study, total number of patients, demographics of patients, follow‐up duration, type of reconstruction, time from initial reconstruction, reconstructive details, and reconstructive outcomes including flap loss and contracture recurrence were collected.

The methodological quality of all included studies was independently evaluated by two authors. Given that no randomized controlled trials were identified, the Methodological Index for Non‐Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool was applied to assess study quality (Slim et al.2003). To explore the presence of potential publication bias, funnel plots were generated based on effect sizes of reported outcomes.

Statistical analyses and graph generation were conducted using MedCalc statistical software version 23.0.5 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium). Data were pooled using a random‐effects model with the DerSimonian and Laird estimator (DerSimonian and Laird2015). Incidences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the exact binomial method, with proportions stabilized via the Freeman–Tukey double arcsine transformation to describe key complication rates, including total and partial flap loss, venous congestion, and tip necrosis when available. Heterogeneity for each outcome was assessed using the I (Schneider et al.2006) statistic, with values of 0%–25% indicating low heterogeneity, 26%–50% moderate, and over 50% high (Higgins et al.2003). Chi‐squared tests were applied to analyze weighted proportions, with statistical significance defined asp< 0.05. Sensitivity analyses were not performed, as they are not typically applicable in proportional meta‐analyses of single‐arm outcomes. The pooled estimates reflect the overall incidence of events across studies without comparative arms, and heterogeneity was addressed using a random‐effects model.

Improvement of contracture was defined as improved joint range of motion following reconstruction, as reported in each individual study. Outcome measures were categorized by anatomic site as follows: for hand contractures, clinical improvement in activities of daily living was used (Davami and Pourkhameneh2011); for axillary contractures, either clearly stated clinical improvement or improvement in the preoperative range of abduction (Chen et al.2017); for neck contractures, includes clearly stated clinical improvement, cervicomental angle of less than 110° or postoperative neck extension exceeding the horizontal plane (> 100°) (Angrigiani1994; Wang et al.2012); and for elbow and knee contractures, either clearly stated clinical improvement or improvements in the preoperative arc of flexion–extension (Chang et al.2021; Karagoz et al.2011).

There were 830 contractures identified which underwent flap‐based reconstruction. Anatomic areas included the hand (including dorsal and volar surfaces), cubital fossa, axilla, neck (anterior and lateral) and popliteal fossa. Other anatomic areas including groin and wrist were sparsely reported in the literature; hence, not included in this study.

Mean age of included patients was 27.3 years (IQR: 11.3–51 years) and mean follow‐up duration was 23.8 months (IQR: 6.6–108 months). Males comprised 63.7% of the study population. Overall average time between initial reconstruction and contracture development/repair was 38.3 months (IQR: 8.3–107 months).

The 27 included studies were assessed using the MINORS criteria. Scores ranged from 8 to 14, with a median score of 11. The most common methodological limitations were lack of prospective data collection, small study size, and unclear reporting of follow‐up duration. In contrast, all studies demonstrated clearly stated aims, appropriate endpoints, and unbiased assessment of outcomes. Individual MINORS scores for each study are provided in Table1.

A total of 128 contractures of the hand and fingers were released and repaired. The axial groin flap was the most used flap at 40.6% (n= 52) followed by the super‐thin abdominal skin pedicle flap (based on the superficial inferior epigastric artery) at 32.0% (n= 41). The first dorsal metacarpal artery flap [10.9%,n= 14], dorsalis pedis free flap [5.5%,n= 7] and medial thigh perforator flap [1.6%,n= 2] were the least frequently utilized. Other flaps used included the posterior interosseous free flap at 3.1% (n= 4), free arterialized venous flap at 3.1% (n= 4), free radial forearm flap at 1.6% (n= 2) and “fill‐up webspace” flap (a modified dorsalis pedis artery flap) at 1.6% (n= 2). All flaps survived, and contracture improvement was exhibited in 99.3% (n= 127) of cases. There were no instances of flap venous congestion or reports of significant donor‐site morbidity. Partial flap loss was observed in 5.4% (n= 7) of contractures repaired. The contracture recurrence rate was 0.7% (n= 1), but no contractures required secondary revision procedures (Table2).

Summary of flap complications by location repaired.

A total of 62 axillary contractures were repaired. Scapular flaps were used in 43.5% (n= 27) of contractures, including 30.6% (n= 19) scapular island flaps and 12.9% (n= 8) parascapular flaps. Thoracodorsal perforator‐based cutaneous island flaps were used in 29.0% (n= 18) of reported contractures; anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps in 24.2% (n= 15); and medial thigh perforator flaps in 3.3% (n= 2).

All flaps survived, and contracture improvement was observed in all (n= 62) cases. No instances of flap venous congestion or significant donor‐site morbidity were reported. Partial flap loss occurred in 1.6% (n= 1) of flaps. No contracture recurrence or need for secondary revision procedures was reported (Table2).

A total of 558 neck contractures were released and repaired. Supraclavicular flaps (island and skin pedicled) were used in 74.5% (n= 416) of contractures, deltopectoral flaps in 12.4% (n= 69), superficial cervical artery perforator flaps in 5.7% (n= 32), trapezius fasciocutaneous flaps in 2.3% (n= 13), free ALT flaps in 2.9% (n= 16), and free thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps in 2.2% (n= 12) of reported reconstructions.

Flap survival was observed in 97.5% (n= 544) of cases. There was a reported total flap loss of 2.5% (n= 14), venous congestion in 4.1% (n= 23), and partial flap loss in 4.8% (n= 27). Contracture resolution was achieved in 96.2% (n= 537) of patients, with no reported recurrence. Elective secondary procedures were reported in two studies and included flap debulking and scar revisions includingz‐plasty (Wang et al.2012; Sunil et al.2015). (Table2).

A total of 52 elbow contractures were repaired. The mean repair timing was 26.9 months (IQR: 8.3–43 months) following the initial burn injury. The thoracodorsal artery perforator flap was used for 40.4% (n= 21) of elbow contracture repairs, followed by the pedicled adipofascial flap (based on the ulnar artery) for 25% (n= 13), the bipedicled flap (based on the posterior radial collateral artery [PRCA]) for 23.1% (n= 12) and the lateral intercostal artery perforator‐based pedicled reverse thoraco‐abdominal flap for 11.5% (n= 6) of reported contracture reconstructions. All (n= 52) flaps survived, and contractures were successfully addressed. Venous congestion occurred in 9.6% (n= 5) of cases, with a partial flap loss rate of 5.8% (n= 3) and donor‐site morbidity, specifically the development of a seroma, reported in 1.9% (n= 1). Three (5.8%) of the contractures repaired needed secondary debulking to improve aesthetics; however, there was no reported contracture recurrence (Table2).

A total of 30 contractures of the popliteal fossa were repaired. The thoracodorsal perforator artery flap was used in 56.7% (n= 17) of cases, while the ALT flap was used in 43.3% (n= 13) of cases. All flaps survived, and there were no reported instances of flap venous congestion or donor‐site morbidity. Partial flap loss occurred in 20.0% (n= 6) of contractures. Contracture resolution was observed in 63.3% (n= 19) of cases, with no reported recurrences. Additional procedures, including debulking and scar revisions, were performed in 16.7% (n= 5) of contractures (Table2).

The rate of pedicled flap loss was 1.5% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]) and the rate of free flap loss was 2.9% (I2= 37.9% [95% CI: 0.9–5.8]). Partial flap loss was 6.9% (I2= 65.1% [95% CI: 3.4–11.5]) for pedicled and 5.2% (I2= 65.0% [95% CI: 1.7–10.4]) for free flaps. Flap venous congestion rate was only reported for pedicled flaps and was 7.5% (I2= 81.4%) Table3.

Contracture resolution rate was found to be 98.9% (I2= 0%) for pedicled and 92.2% (I2= 82.8%) for free flaps. Details of range of motion assessment are presented in Table4. Contracture recurrence rate was 1.8% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 0.7–3.3]) for pedicled flaps and 0.6% (I2= 0% [95% CI: 0.1–1.7]) for free flaps.

Average cervicomandibular angle was improved by 59.28° (preop, 55.72°; postop, 115°).

When pedicled and free flap outcomes were directly compared, there was no difference in the rate of total flap loss (1.5% vs. 2.9%p= 0.18), partial flap loss (6.9% vs. 5.2%p= 0.31), contracture resolution (98.9% vs. 92.2%p= 0.50) or contracture recurrence rates (1.8% vs. 0.6%p= 0.15) respectively.

Successful burn contracture reconstruction necessitates consideration of available healthy tissue, reconstructive morbidity, and mitigation of the risk of recurrence. Studies have reported that flap reconstruction is the best method to correct contractures when aiming to prevent recurrence (Verhaegen et al.2011; Hayashida and Akita2017). This is particularly important when contractures involve joints, areas that a contracture can diminish or prevent functional capabilities. In this study, 830 burn contractures were identified which were reconstructed with 477 pedicled (57.5%) and 353 free flaps (42.5%). Overall, an improvement in joint movement was seen in more than 90% of the sites reconstructed.

We demonstrated that the rates of re‐contracture were 1.8% for repairs with pedicled flaps and 0.6% for repairs with free flaps, with a mean follow‐up of 23.8 months. These findings were similar to rates reported by Lui et al., who reported a re‐contracture rate of 0.6% following free flap reconstruction of scars (Liu et al.2024). Further, hand contractures recurred in 0.7% (n= 1) of contractures from our included studies, which indicated better results than those previously reported following split‐thickness skin graft reconstruction (17%) (Sunil et al.2015). Currently, literature reports that postoperative recurrent contracture can develop as far out as 17–24 months (Balumuka et al.2015; Carmichael et al.2005). With this consideration, our recurrence rate was less than that reported following graft reconstruction, providing further support for the utility of flap‐based reconstruction for post‐burn joint contractures. This study uniquely reports the rate of joint re‐contractures following pedicled and free flap reconstruction of burn contractures, successfully demonstrating excellent outcomes compared to non‐flap based reconstructive techniques.

Flap reconstruction carries a risk of additional procedures, particularly if flap loss occurs or if the flap is aesthetically disfiguring. In terms of flap failure rates, 1.5% of pedicled flaps and 2.9% of free flaps were reported to be non‐viable in this study, the instance of this being similar between pedicled and free flaps. Liu et al. previously reported a total flap loss rate of 3.8% for contracture repairs using free flaps, which is similar to our findings (Liu et al.2024). The rate of partial flap loss in free flap reconstructions was comparable to what has been reported (Liu et al.2024). It is important to note that the rate of free flap loss is indirectly related to surgeon skill (Bleasdale et al.2015), indicating that microsurgically trained surgeons are an important resource for burn centers that seek to provide optimal joint contracture reconstruction.

Our study found that most elective secondary procedures were performed for the elbows, neck, and knees. Debulking procedures were utilized to improve contour, particularly in instances when the chosen reconstructive flap was thicker than the surrounding tissue. Additionally, procedures to improve scar hypertrophy and keloids were also reported. Silicone has been a commonly reported substance that could be utilized to decrease the need for secondary procedures in the early stages of wound healing if a free flap is planned (Balumuka et al.2015). Overall, aesthetically targeted revision procedures are more common for exposed reconstructed areas, and patients should be aware of this before choosing this reconstructive method (Pradier et al.2007; Petro and Niazi2010). Unlike flap loss, aesthetic refinements can be addressed non‐urgently and be scheduled around functional improvement.

There are numerous emerging techniques aimed at reducing the risk of contracture rates aside from flaps or autografts. These include the use of acellular dermal matrices, such as Integra, Dermacell, and Kerecis, as well as various allografts (Dilek et al.2024). These techniques involve staging grafts with an intermediary substance, which has been shown to significantly diminish the risk of re‐contracture. Although these methods are promising, they are still in the early stages of study and their long‐term impact remains uncertain, with limited data available on their effects on burn contracture prevention (Pradier et al.2007). These advancements may shift clinical practice toward reducing the morbidity associated with flap reconstruction. However, further data is needed to fully understand how these innovations compare to flaps and grafts.

Our study has limitations owed largely to issues with inconsistent reporting of source data used to perform this systematic review and meta‐analysis and lack of uniform anatomic descriptions. For example, some studies did not make a clear distinction between anterior neck and lateral neck contracture repairs. This did not allow us to separate the outcomes and discretely analyze. Additionally, some studies did not differentiate secondary flap procedures performed, as some patients may have had these procedures to improve cosmesis, for example, debulking or to improve mobility, for example, additionalz‐plasty. Due to the complexities of burn reconstructions, variation in surgical techniques may exist, potentially confounding any reported negative outcomes. Another limitation of this study is the lack of standardized reporting for joint range of motion outcomes. Most studies noted that range of motion improved following reconstruction; however, this was assessed in different ways according to each study. Further, comparisons across joint sites could not be made due to the different study designs of the included studies. Although justified by severe limitation of function leading to reconstruction of contracture with flaps (Chang et al.2021), the time from initial reconstruction to this definitive reconstruction may be short based on senior authors experience. This may have potentially overestimated the rate of contracture development using alternative techniques. Finally, some studies may have underreported their negative outcomes, as we could not compare outcomes of free versus pedicled flaps on venous congestion and contracture recurrence due to incomplete reporting. Additionally, the only anatomic site that total flap loss was reported for was the neck, which could indicate reporting bias in the literature. From the authors own experience, there were some flap reconstruction options that were not cited in the literature, for example, the use of a pedicled latissimus dorsi flap for axillary burn contracture reconstruction. This points to another limitation of this analysis, which is that it may not include all methods of reconstruction available to the burn surgeon.

Through this study, supporting evidence is provided for the use of flap‐based reconstruction in the setting of post‐burn contracture management. Although the morbidity of a flap may be more than grafting or local tissue rearrangement, the rates of re‐contracture and risk are low enough to support their use, especially for joint reconstruction, which requires adequate range of motion for function.
