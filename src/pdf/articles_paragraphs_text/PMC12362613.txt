The primary objective is to examine the efficacy of botulinum toxin therapy in the treatment of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) compared with placebo or no treatment.

The secondary objectives are to investigate the dose effect of botulinum toxin and the complication rates associated with botulinum toxin.

Vulvodynia is a common pain disorder among premenopausal women, with an estimated prevalence of 8.3% to 16% among women in the USA [1,2,3]. Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), previously known as vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS), is the most frequently reported subcategory of vulvodynia and the most common reason for sexual pain in young women. According to the 2015 Consensus Terminology and Classification of Persistent Vulvar Pain and Vulvodynia, PVD refers to pain at the openings of the urethra and vagina (the vulvar vestibule) that lasts for more than three months and occurs without the presence of any other identifiable vulvar disease [4]. Although the cause is unclear, various psychosocial and pathophysiological factors are thought to play a role in the onset and persistence of this pain [4,5].

Societal misconceptions and stigmatization often surround this condition, contributing to the suffering of those affected [6]. Moreover, the historical under‐representation of women's health issues in research and funding exacerbates the challenges faced by those with vestibulodynia [7].

Non‐pharmacological treatments, pharmacological treatments, and surgical interventions have been tested for vulvodynia, both individually and in combination. Non‐pharmacological options mainly include variations of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pelvic floor physical therapy, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Pharmacological treatments include muscle relaxants and agents that target peripheral and central pain mechanisms [5]. However, there is currently no 'gold standard' treatment for women with this condition [8,9].

Botulinum toxin acts by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction, leading to chemodenervation and temporary muscle paralysis [10]. Only botulinum toxin serotypes A and B (BTX‐A and BTX‐B) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neurological conditions.

Examples of pain syndromes successfully treated with botulinum toxin include interstitial cystitis and migraine [11,12]. Several theories explain how botulinum toxin alters pain perception, including changes in muscle nociceptor sensitivity, reduced gamma motor neuron activity, altered cholinergic control of vascular and autonomic functions, induced neuroplastic changes in afferent somatosensory processing, and direct effects on pain afferents [13].

There is evidence from observational studies suggesting that botulinum toxin is a potentially effective treatment for PVD.

There are several case reports, observational studies, and clinical trials on the efficacy of BTX‐A in treating vulvodynia with single injections of 10 to 80 units [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29].

There are also previous systematic reviews that have addressed a similar question. One systematic review – now out of date – focused on chronic pelvic pain [30]. One large systematic review examined all possible interventions for PVD but involved no quantitative pooling of data [8].

The primary objective is to examine the efficacy of botulinum toxin therapy in the treatment of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) compared with placebo or no treatment.

The secondary objectives are to investigate the dose effect of botulinum toxin and the complication rates associated with botulinum toxin.

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the review [31], and PRISMA 2020 for the reporting [32].

We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of PVD. We will exclude cross‐over trials, cluster RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, and other observational studies to maintain a higher level of methodological rigor. We will include both published and unpublished studies and apply no language restrictions.

We will include studies in adults (age ≥ 18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of PVD, regardless of race, social and economic status, profession, or place of residence. We will consider a diagnosis of PVD according to the 2015 Consensus Terminology and Classification of Persistent Vulvar Pain and Vulvodynia [4].

We will not include people with the following contraindications to botulinum toxin.

We will include studies with a mixture of eligible and ineligible participants if separate data for eligible participants are available.

We will include intramuscular injections of any type of botulinum toxin administered into the vaginal muscles or soft tissues of the groin, regardless of dosage regimen. Although only BTX‐A and BTX‐B are FDA‐approved, we will also include other types such as botulinum toxin type F (BTX‐F) to capture exploratory or off‐label studies.

Eligible studies will not be restricted based on treatment duration, frequency, or intensity.

We will consider studies with co‐interventions if these are evenly distributed between groups.

Botulinum toxin must be delivered via localized injections by trained physicians, typically in outpatient clinical settings such as gynecology or sexual medicine departments. We will not exclude studies based on the use of anesthetic agents, such as topical creams applied prior to injection, nor based on whether a single or repeated injection strategy was employed. We will also include studies utilizing either submucosal or subcutaneous injection techniques if they are directed to relevant anatomical sites related to PVD.

Eligible comparators will be placebo or no treatment. A placebo is an inactive drug or procedure intended to have no therapeutic effect. The duration, frequency, or intensity of the placebo will not be restricted.

We will include trials with eligible study design, participants, interventions and comparators, irrespective of whether they report our prespecified outcomes.

Since the effect of botulinum toxin generally lasts for two to three months before gradually wearing off, we will consider outcomes measured up to three months after administration [33].

If an improvement scale is defined in each study, we will assess the appropriateness of data integration by conducting an analysis based on the criteria used in each study.

Economic outcomes are not within the scope of this review.

We found no core outcome set for this review in the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database.

We will report all critical and important outcomes in the summary of findings table, abstract, and plain language summary of the review [34].

Adverse events (AEs), complications, and negative treatment effects. If reported, adverse events and complications will be divided into mild or severe. We will first extract the proportion of participants with AEs, and secondly extract data on other descriptions of AEs and complications.

Sexual function and satisfaction. Our preferred measurement tool is the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Other eligible measures of sexual health include the Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS) and Global Sexual Functioning (GSF) score [36,37].

Mental distress. We will extract data from validated instruments that assess anxiety and depressive symptoms. The examples below are listed in order of preference.

We will develop a search strategy for each database to identify studies for inclusion in the review. The corresponding search strategies will be based on the design for Ovid MEDLINE, with adjustments for differences in vocabulary and syntax guidelines (seeSupplementary material 1). This search strategy will utilize the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity‐maximizing version (2008 revision), as described in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[43]. A title and abstract filter will be applied when appropriate to focus the search on relevant textual content. We will not restrict searches by language or publication date, and we will also include unpublished studies.

We will conduct an additional search for relevant studies in topic‐related reviews and reference lists of retrieved papers. In addition, we will conduct electronic searches of the following sources.

Moreover, we will perform an online search for abstracts and unpublished studies in the indexes of the annual meetings held by the following organizations.

Finally, for unpublished results and ongoing studies, we will search the following trial registries.

We will contact experts in the field for information about any ongoing or unpublished trials as needed.

We will also check for any postpublication amendments (including retractions, errata, and expressions of concern) related to included or potentially eligible studies. We will search the Retraction Watch Database (retractiondatabase.org/) and the websites of the journals in which the studies were published to identify any such amendments.

To identify eligible studies, two review authors (SK, JS) will screen the titles and abstracts of papers retrieved by the search. They will then evaluate the full‐text articles of potentially eligible studies to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria. A third review author (NW) will resolve any disagreements regarding eligibility by co‐ordinating a group discussion to reach a final decision. We will list all studies excluded at the full‐text review stage along with the main reasons for their exclusion in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.

When unanticipated issues arise, the review authors will make sensible post hoc decisions about study inclusion or exclusion and will document any such decisions in the review.

We will create a standardized data extraction form using Covidence to systematically collect and organize data on study characteristics [44]. This form will be piloted on at least one included study. The information of interest will include details of interventions and comparisons, participants, co‐interventions, and randomization procedures. We will also document definitions used and information required for the risk of bias assessment. Two review authors (SK, JP) will independently extract the data, with a third review author (NW) resolving any disagreements. Additionally, we will record any other information pertinent to the objectives of this review. For studies not written in English, we will employ specialized translation services if needed.

We will use the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to evaluate the following sources of bias in included studies [45].

The outcomes assessed using RoB 2 will be the critical outcomes contributing to the summary of findings table, as follows.

The nature of the effect of interest is the effect of assignment to the interventions at baseline, regardless of whether the interventions were received as intended (the 'intention‐to‐treat effect'). Two review authors (SK, JP) will independently evaluate each domain. The RoB 2 algorithm will categorize risk of bias judgments as 'low risk of bias,' 'some concerns,' or 'high risk of bias,' based on the responses to a set of signaling questions. We will use the RoB 2 Excel tool (available at www.riskofbias.info/) to implement and manage the assessment. Any disagreements will be resolved by a third review author (NW). We will create a graphic to illustrate the proportion of studies in each risk category. Additionally, we will provide a detailed description of the risk of bias for each study in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We will contact the corresponding authors or co‐authors of the included studies via email for further information as needed. We will assess the overall risk of bias in each study as low risk of bias (if all domains are low risk), high risk of bias (if one or more domains are high risk), or some concerns (if no domains are high risk but one or more domains are some concerns).

We will use the mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate treatment effects for continuous outcomes measured on the same scale. We will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) when different scales are used for the same outcome. For recurrent events, we will employ the rate ratio, as detailed in Section 6.7.1 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[46].

For studies in which more than two arms are deemed relevant, we will distribute participants from the control group across the other groups (interventions) in any meta‐analysis to avoid double counting. For outcomes reported at multiple time points, we will focus on those reported closest to three months for each study. In all cases, we will consider the participant as the unit of analysis. For events that may recur, we will use the rate ratio as outlined above.

In the case of missing data, we will contact the corresponding authors, provided contact information is available. We will employ the intention‐to‐treat approach if the data are reported accordingly. If missing data cannot be obtained after author contact, we will impute replacement values and treat these as if they were observed. To assess the robustness of our results, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of assumptions made on the findings. We will discuss the potential influence of missing data on our conclusions in the 'Discussion' section of the review.

We will assess publication bias according to the recommendations in Section 13.3.5 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[47].

We will apply the random‐effects model using a restricted maximum likelihood variance estimator for improved performance [48]. We will use Wald‐type CIs by default to calculate the CI for the summary effect; however, if the number of studies is small and between‐study variance is greater than zero, we will apply the Hartung‐Knapp‐Sidik‐Jonkman (HKSJ) method according to the recommendations in Section 10.10.4.4 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[49]. The decision to perform a meta‐analysis will be based on the availability of data and the degree of heterogeneity between studies. We will conduct the meta‐analysis using RevMan software and generate forest plots to illustrate the effects [50]. If meta‐analysis is not feasible, we will present the data according to the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis (SWiM) guideline [51].

If we observe heterogeneity in the data, we will verify whether the data were accurately extracted and entered. Once confirmed, we will visually inspect the graphs and remove studies as needed to restore homogeneity. If this process affects data contributing no more than 10% to the total weighting, we will report it. If substantial heterogeneity persists, especially with inconsistent effect directions, we will not pool these data in a meta‐analysis but will discuss them narratively. For significant unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity, we will suggest hypotheses for future reviews but will not conduct statistical analyses.

We will consider performing subgroup analyses or meta‐regression for the critical outcomes based on the following factors.

Dose of intervention. The intervention can be administered in different doses. Due to the lack of official dose equivalence across various brands of botulinum toxin, we will consider this parameter for subgroup analysis.

Botulinum toxin type. Although BTX‐A is most commonly used for intervention in PVD, if studies evaluate the use of other botulinum toxin types for the same purpose, we will conduct a subgroup analysis based on this parameter.

We will compare subgroups using the formal test for subgroup differences in RevMan [50].

We will report any relevant characteristics covered by the PROGRESS‐Plus acronym (place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socio‐economic status, social capital, age, sexual orientation, and disability) [52]. Additionally, we will examine whether the interventions we assess could lead to health inequities within our female population.

We will conduct a sensitivity analysis for our critical outcomes to assess the validity and strength of our conclusions. This analysis will involve evaluating the impact of excluding studies with a high risk of bias and addressing any missing data.

We will use the GRADE approach and the summary of findings table format to assess our certainty in the retrieved evidence [34]. With the GRADE method, evidence from RCTs is initially ranked as high certainty but can be downgraded by one level (to 'moderate'), two levels (to 'low'), or three levels (to 'very low'), depending on the presence of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias [34]. Two review authors (SK, JP) will evaluate the certainty of the evidence independently and in duplicate, with a third review author (NW) resolving any conflicts.

We will create summary of findings tables to summarize the results and our confidence in the evidence [34]. These tables will present two comparisons: botulinum toxin intramuscular injection (in the musculus bulbospongiosus, or the dorsal vulvar vestibulum) versus placebo or no treatment.

We will present results for our prespecified outcomes at three months.

This review will not involve direct consumer participation in the development or conduct of the research. However, the findings of the review will be disseminated in a format that is accessible and understandable to consumers, ensuring that the results can inform healthcare decisions at the patient level. Future updates of the review may consider involving consumer representatives to ensure that the perspectives and priorities of end‐users are adequately reflected.
