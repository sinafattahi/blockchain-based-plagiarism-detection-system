This study investigates, for the first time, the biological characteristics and population dynamics of the golden grey mullet (Chelon auratus)captured along the Southeastern Black Sea coast. A total of 324 specimens, comprising 142 females (43.83%) and 182 males (56.17%), were analyzed. The total lengths of all samples ranged from 16.5 to 38.8 cm, with an average size of 26.9 ± 3.714 cm, body weights varied between 37.76 and 568.56 g, averaging 172.475 ± 72.240 g. The length-weight relationships were determined as W = 0.0129TL2.864for females, W = 0.0150TL2.827for males, and W = 0.0158TL2.809for overall, indicating negative allometric growth (b < 3) across sexes and overall. Asymptotic length values (L∞) were calculated as 45.12 cm for females, 43.97 cm for males, and 44.54 cm for overall individuals with growth performance (Φ′) values of 1.390, 1.382 and 1.386, respectively. The age-length relationships were determined as Lt= 45.12 (1-e− 0.205 (t+1.67)) for females, Lt= 43.97 (1-e− 0.201 (t+1.69)) for males, and Lt= 44.54 (1-e− 0.201 (t+1.71)) for overall. The condition factor (K) ranged from 0.739 ± 0.103 in June 2020 to 0.963 ± 0.054 in October 2020. The population was predominantly composed of 3-year-old individuals (40.91%), with ages spanning 1 to 6 years. The total length at first maturity (Lm50) was calculated as 21.87 cm for females and 21.45 cm for males. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) analyses indicated that the reproduction period occurred from August to September. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological characteristics ofC. auratus. These results will provide valuable data for future comparative studies and offer essential insights for policymakers aiming to promote sustainable fisheries management and the protection of golden grey mullet stocks in the Black Sea.

The golden grey mullet,Chelon auratus(Risso, 1810), a member of the family Mugilidae, inhabits marine, brackish, and freshwater environments. The Mugilidae family comprises 20 genera and 75 species1.C. auratusis found in coastal waters in the Eastern Atlantic from Scotland to Cape Verde, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and southern Norway to Morocco. It is rarely found off Mauritania2,3. Adults are typically neritic, usually found in schools, entering lagoons and lower estuaries, but rarely entering freshwater. Juveniles move to coastal lagoons and estuaries in winter and especially in spring3.

Initially described asMugil auratusby Risso (1810) in the Northwestern Mediterranean (Nice, France), the species was later referred to asLiza aurataby numerous researchers4–13. However, the species was later identified asChelon aurata(Risso 1810) by some researchers. As a result of modern morphological and genetic analyses carried out in recent years, the name of the species changed toChelon auratus(Risso 1810), which is the accepted current name of the species used nowadays14–22.

In the Black Sea, five Mugilidae species have been identified:Chelon auratus(Risso 1810),C. labrosus(Risso 1827),C. ramada(Risso 1827),C. saliens(Risso 1810),Mugil cephalus(Linnaeus 1758). It has been reported that the number of species increased to six with the release of the Pacific-origin species, previously known asMugil soiuy, currently the synonym ofPlaniliza haematocheilus(Parin 2003) into the Black Sea in the 1980’s3,23–25. The catches of grey mullets hold significant economic value in Turkish marine fisheries, with annual catches decreasing from 1,721 tons in 2014 to 1,445 tons in 2024. The catch amount of grey mullets has shown a variable trend over the years.C. auratusis often lumped under “grey mullet” in the national statistics. There’s no species-specific official catch data published for this species26.

The grey mullets are mainly caught by seiners and trammel nets during the allowed commercial fishing season from September to April, representing a key target species for artisanal fisheries27,28, holding significant ecological and socio-economic value along the Turkish Black Sea coast. The Black Sea contributes almost 70–80% of Turkish total marine capture production, with the Eastern and Central Black Sea alone accounting for 65–75% of that output. Nearly 40% of the national fishing fleet operates in the Black Sea, dominated by small vessels, emphasizing the regional reliance on small pelagic species like mullets26. Despite the Black Sea has valuable and productive seafood, significant decreases have been observed in the amount of fish caught over the years due to several factors such as fishing pressure on species, marine pollution, and climate change. Taking the necessary measures to protect fish stocks and ensure their sustainability is of great ecological, social, and economic importance. Sustainable management of fish stocks is thus indispensable for ensuring food security, economic stability, and ecosystem resilience. This requires the collection of accurate biological, ecological, and socioeconomic data, as well as the implementation of adaptive, science-based policies and regulations29,30.

The goal of sustainable fisheries management is to ensure that stocks are not only healthy but also productive; in other words, the catch value or volume can be maximized under sustainability constraints31. Sustainable fisheries management in the GFCM 2030 strategy adopts a scientific, participatory, inclusive, and environmentally responsible approach. Its goal is to protect fish stocks while enhancing the quality of life and economic resilience of coastal communities32. Moreover, sustainable fisheries management is also a win-win-win strategy to increase fishers’ welfare, preserve ocean health, and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Effective management requires a coordinated package of policy tools that limit how much, how and where fish can be caught. Management, including research on fish stock health, and enforcement are essential components for effective and sustainable fisheries management and need to be provided, or at least overseen, by some level of government31. Biological data can help determine technical measures such as appropriate fishing quotas, minimum catch sizes, and periods for fishing bans for a species. Otherwise, the risk of overfishing increases, potentially leading to the collapse of fish stocks33,34.

C. auratusis a key resource for small-scale and recreational fishers in the southeastern Black Sea. This study addressed some gaps in understanding its basic population parameters and spawning aspects, which are essential for the effective management of its fisheries. The absence of stock assessments indicates a critical gap in regional fishery science and policy. Hence, this study aims to investigate the age, growth, and reproductive characteristics ofC. auratusfor the first time along the Southeastern Black Sea coast. The findings are intended to provide valuable scientific data to support the sustainable management and exploitation of this important commercial fish species in the region.

This study was conducted between May 2020 and April 2021 along the Southeastern Black Sea, where commercial fishing activity is intensive (Fig.1). A total of 324 golden grey mullet (Chelon auratus) specimens were randomly collected monthly from local fishermen operating in the region. The collected specimens were immediately chilled with ice and kept at a low temperature until they were promptly transferred to the laboratory for detailed measurements and analysis. For each specimen, the total length (TL, cm) and total weight (TW, g), liver weight (LW, g), and ovarium weight (OW, g) were determined to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 g, respectively. The sex identification of the specimens was made based on the morphological characteristics of the gonads and the sexual maturity stages of individuals was determined by macroscopic examination of the gonads. The stages of gonadal development were determined by macroscopic examination of the gonads using the maturity scale (stage I: Immature; stage II: Maturing virgin and recovering spent; stage III: Ripening; stage IV: Ripe; stage V: Spent) described by Holden and Raitt35. For age estimation sagittal otolith pairs of the fish were removed with fine-tipped forceps, cleaned of waste materials, and stored in an Eppendorf tube containing 70% ethyl alcohol36. Age estimation was performed by reading annual growth rings (pairs of opaque and translucent zones) on the otoliths under a stereozoom binocular microscope and photographed using a type of microscope (SMZ1270) and NIS Element software (Nikon, ver. 4.50). Age readings were independently verified by two trained readers at different times to ensure accuracy37,38.

The difference in mean total length and weight between the sexes was tested using the Independent Sample t-test. Pauly’s t-test was applied to compare the slopes to confirm whether the b value was different from the isometric growth (b = 3) for both sexes and overall individuals52. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to test the differences for length–weight relationship between the sexes. The sex ratio (female: male) was tested applying the chi-square test (χ2), whether the observed ratio between female to male is deviated from the expected ratio of 1:153. All statistical analyses performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (ver.29.0.2.0) software package and plots were generated using the Microsoft Excel (Microsoft ver. 365) package.

A total of 324 golden grey mullet (C. auratus) specimens were analyzed, with total lengths (TL) ranging from 16.5 to 38.8 cm (mean: 26.9 ± 3.714 cm) and total weights (TW) between 37.76 and 568.56 g (mean: 172.475 ± 72.240 g). Significant differences in mean TL and TW between the sexes were observed (independent t-test, tTL= 7.731; tTW= 6.511,p< 0.001). The number of specimens, also the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation (SD) values of TL and TW for female, male, and overall individuals of the golden grey mullet were given in Table1.

The total lengths (TL) ranged from 18.1 to 38.8 cm for females and from 16.5 to 35.2 cm for males. As can be seen from the length-frequency distributions, it was observed that the majority (N= 230; 70.99%) of the golden grey mullet samples in the total catch were between 24 and 30 cm length classes. The length-frequency distribution ofC. auratusby sexes is presented in Fig.2.

The b-values of the LWRs revealed that the growth type of males, females, and overall individuals was negative allometric (b < 3) that deviated significantly from the isometric growth (b = 3) (Paulys’ t-test; tfemale= 2.191, tmale= 2.916, tsexes combined= 4.796,p< 0.05). The LWRs and growth patterns calculated separately for each sex were shown in Table2; Fig.3A–C respectively. Results of the LWRs indicated that the values of the coefficient of determination (R2) between the total length and weight variables for both sexes and overall individuals were highly correlated (R2> 0.9) for each sex and relationship (Table2).

The mean condition factor values of the golden grey mullet specimens were determined to be the lowest in June 2020 (0.739 ± 0.103) for overall individuals, and the highest in October 2020 (0.963 ± 0.054). It was determined that the lowest value for female individuals was 0.722 ± 0.039 in June 2020, and the highest value was 0.961 ± 0.064 in October 2020. For male individuals, the lowest value was 0.701 ± 0.051 in April 2021, and the highest value was 0.965 ± 0.045 in October 2020. It was observed that there was a significant increase in the condition factor values of both female and male individuals examined in July and October 2020, and a significant decrease starting from October 2020 (Fig.4).

When the hepatosomatic index (HSI) values of golden grey mullet individuals were examined the mean hepatosomatic index (HSI) values for overall individuals varied from 0.399 ± 0.159 (May 2020) to 1.443 ± 0.466 (February 2021. For female individuals, the lowest value was determined as 0.417 ± 0.180 in May 2020, and the highest value was determined as 1.596 ± 0.518 in February 2021. For male individuals, the lowest HSI values ​​were determined in May 2020 (0.357 ± 0.104), and the highest (1.569 ± 0.951) in August 2020. HSI values ​​for both female and male individuals showed a significant increase in June, August, October and February, and a general decrease in other months. HSI values ​​of both sexes followed a horizontal trend from October to December (Fig.5).

In our study, otoliths were taken from 199 of the 324 golden grey mullet individuals sampled and age determination was performed. Age estimation based on otolith readings revealed that the specimens ranged from 1 to 6 years of age, with 3-year-old individuals comprising the dominant age group (40.91%). The youngest specimen was a 1-year-old male (16.5 cm TL), while the oldest was a 6-year-old female (38.8 cm TL). The image of a 5-year-old golden grey mullet individual otolith is given in Fig.6.

Individuals in the 3-year-old age group were dominant with 40.70%. The dominant age group was determined to be 3-year-olds in males at 48.48% and 4-year-olds in females at 40%. The minimum, maximum, and mean total lengths corresponding to ages by sex are presented in Table3.

The asymptotic length values (L∞) for females, males and overall individuals were calculated as 45.12 cm, 43.97 cm and 44.54 cm, respectively, and also the growth performance index (Φ′) values were found as 1.390, 1.382 and 1.386, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) fitted to length at age data were found Lt= 45.12 (1-e-0.205 (t+1.67)) for females, Lt= 43.97 (1-e-0.201 (t+1.69)) for males, and Lt= 44.54 (1-e-0.201 (t+1.71)) for overall individuals. The VBGF fitted to weight at age data were also established as: Wt= 705.88(1-e-0.205 (t+1.67))2.864, Wt= 655.81(1-e-0.201(t+1.69))2.827and Wt= 680.26 (1-e-0.201 (t+1.71))2.809for females, males and overall individuals, respectively. The VBGF parameters are given in Table4.

Of the 324 golden grey mullet specimens, 43.83% (N= 142) were females, and 56.17% (N= 182) were males. The ratio of male to female was calculated as 1.28:1.00 in favor of males deviating significantly from the expected ratio of 1:1 (χ² = 1.316;p< 0.05), indicating that the ratio of males was significantly higher than the females.

During the reproductive period of the golden grey mullet, the eggs were clearly visible to the naked eye, the ovarian lobes were swollen, and the blood vessels on them were evident. Besides, the testicles of male individuals were found to have cream-colored lobes and a soft texture. As a result of the macroscopic examination of the gonads, the percentage distribution of immature and maturing virgin (I-II), mature ripening (III), ripe (IV) and spent individuals (V) by months were given in Fig.7A, B. In female individuals, it is observed that stages IV and V were more intense in August. In male individuals, it was determined that all individuals were in stage IV in August. Moreover, the gonads of female and male individuals were seen mostly in stage V in October and November. By evaluating the observed maturity stages, the results indicated that there was a relatively short spawning period forC. auratusfrom August to September in the study area.

The length at first sexual maturity (Lm50) corresponding to the 50% sexual maturity frequency calculated from the ratio of mature individuals to overall individuals in each length class was estimated as 21.87 cm for females and 21.45 cm in TL for males (Fig.8A, B). t-test revealed that there was significant difference in mean Lm50values between the sexes (t-test, t = 6.067;p< 0.001).

The highest GSI values for both males and females were observed in August, while lower GSI values were recorded in other months (Fig.9). The mean GSI value for females peaked at 6.841 ± 4.745, while males reached a maximum of 7.170 ± 7.391. GSI values declined sharply following August, indicating the end of the spawning period. Accordingly, it was determined that the reproduction period of the golden grey mullet started in August and the spawning ended completely in September.

The golden grey mullet,Chelon auratus(Risso, 1810), like other members of the Mugilidae family, primarily inhabits coastal lagoons and estuarine environments, where it represents a key target species for artisanal fisheries54. It holds significant ecological and socio-economic value along the Turkish Black Sea coast. In Türkiye, this species supports small-scale fisheries, particularly in the western and central Black Sea regions, where it is valued for both commercial harvest and local consumption30,32. Beyond its economic significance,C. auratusalso fulfills an essential ecological function by acting as a biotic vector of organic matter transfer between littoral zones and offshore marine ecosystems55,56.

In the context of sustainable fisheries management, biological data are essential for both conserving fish stocks and ensuring the sustainability of fisheries. The GFCM 2030 Strategy emphasizes the importance of collecting and evaluating this data as a crucial component of effective management systems32.

Understanding the growth and reproduction characteristics of fish species is crucial for the protection and sustainable management of fish stocks. This study focused on determining the biological characteristics of the golden grey mullet (C. auratus), including growth parameters, sex distribution, age structure, condition factor, hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSI), reproductive period, and size at first maturity for the first time in the study area. These findings provide essential insights into the biology of this economically significant species in Türkiye’s marine fisheries. As a result of modern morphological and genetic analyses carried out in recent years, the species’ name was finally changed toChelon auratus(Risso 1810), and the current nomenclature of the species is used today.

The total lengths of all examined samples in this study ranged between 16.5 and 38.8 cm, with a mean size of 26.9 ± 3.714 cm TL. This range is similar to findings from several studies: İlkyaz et al.57reported individuals in the Homa Lagoon of the Aegean Sea ranging from 7.5 to 39.5 cm; Bilgin et al.58found lengths from 16.2 to 44 cm; Kesiktaş59noted lengths from 13.4 to 46.8 cm; Reis60recorded lengths from 6.2 to 39.3 cm; Hotos and Katselis61observed a range from 9.7 to 59 cm; and Fazli et al.62documented lengths from 22.1 to 51.9 cm. While these length ranges are consistent with some studies, they differ significantly in certain cases, likely due to regional differences. Environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic factors in different regions shape the growth patterns and size ranges observed in fish populations of the same species. These regional differences include various factors such as water temperature, habitat structure and food availability63, fishing pressure and exploitation methods64, water quality and aquatic pollution65, as well as population status and exploitation rates66. Sampling methods can also influence observed length ranges, contributing to variability in reported data.

Of the 324 individuals obtained in the current study, 142 (43.83%) were female and 182 (56.17%) were male, yielding a male-to-female ratio of 1.28:1.00. This sex ratio is similar to previous findings, such as the 1:1.87 ratio reported by İlkyaz et al.57, and 1:1.08 by Kesiktaş59. However, other studies, including Bartulovic et al.67in the Neretva Estuary and Ghaninejad et al.68on the Iranian coast of the Caspian Sea, found a female-to-male ratio of approximately 1:1.22. The sex ratios can vary from species to species, even between different populations of the same species in varying size and age classes, also even between years. In addition, population structure, exploitation status, sampling period, and gear characteristics may cause these differences.

There is an exponential relationship between the length and weight of fishes40. The length-weight relationships (LWRs) of the female, male and overall individuals of the samples were calculated as W = 0.0129TL2.8641, W = 0.0150TL2.8266and W = 0.0158TL2.8086, respectively. The growth was negative allometric (b < 3) in each sex and overall individuals examined. The LWRs were reported to be W = 0.0087TL2.96 byReis60, and as W = 0.0438TL2.532by Samsun et al.69. In contrast, Arruda et al.70calculated the value of b = 2.397 in their study in Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), while Fazli et al.62and Bilgin et al.58found values of 2.964 and 3.21, respectively, with the latter indicating positive allometric growth. The “b” value in the length-weight relationship indicates the fish’s body shape. Physiological changes, hydrological environmental conditions, different food availability during life and biological cycle, growth increase, or growth deterioration can affect the body shape of the fish71. The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) is among the most important equations that describe growth in fish biology50,72. The growth performance of fish in studies conducted by various researchers in different years and regions differs from each other. The growth parameters reported in different regions on the golden grey mullet are given in Table5.

Growth parameters (L∞, K, toand Φ’) reported for the golden grey mullet from different study areas.

The L∞values calculated in this study were similar to the results reported in Homa Lagoon and the Northern Adriatic Sea but differed from other studies. The growth coefficient (K) was found to be higher than the results reported by Bilgin et al.58, Kesiktaş59, Arruda et al.70, Reis60, and Fazli et al.62, but lower than other studies. The golden grey mullet is a long-lived, but relatively slow-growing fish species. Although fish growth is a hereditary species trait, it can vary among different populations of the same species43,50,76. In this context, differences in growth parameters among the results of studies conducted in different regions can occur due to many factors such as genetic differences, environmental conditions, fishing pressure, food availability and quality, and food competition. In addition, methodological differences in age estimations can cause differences in growth performance.

The most effective method to reveal nutritional differences of the same species is the condition factor. The lowest mean condition factor (K) value of the examined individuals was determined to be 0.739 ± 0.103 for overall individuals in June 2020, and the highest value was 0.963 ± 0.054 in October 2020. According to the condition factor values, while the species maximal benefited from nutrients in October, the lowest case occurred in June. Female individuals were determined to have the lowest value in June 2020 and the highest value in October 2020. For male individuals, it was determined that the lowest value was in April 2021 and the highest value was in October 2020. The condition (K) values mainly vary depending on the age, sex, season and habitat of the fish that makes difficult to compare77. However, Bilgin et al.58found the mean K values of the golden grey mullet from the middle Black Sea (Sinop-Samsun) as 0.865 ± 0.022 (0.423–1.609) for males, 0.803 ± 0.011 (0.128-1.500) for females and 0.804 ± 0.009 (0.128–1.609) for overall. Kesiktaş et al.28reported the majority of K values ranged between 1.0 and 1.5 (min. 0.68) in another study conducted in the Golden Horn Estuary, Istanbul in the Sea of Marmara. The variability in the condition factor, which indicates the general nutritional status of fish, according to populations can be due to differences in the nutritional status in the environment or the result of gonadal development status. For any fish species or population throughout their life span in different periods, the condition factor is not constant and can be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. The differences in K values between the studies arise from variations in the weight, age, and size of the individuals sampled, the number of specimens, feeding ratios, and gonadal development78.

The hepatosomatic index (HSI) helps to determine the portion of energy found in the liver outside of the reproductive period. During the reproductive period, most of the energy is used in gonad development. Therefore, throughout the reproductive period HSI values are expected to be lower than those outside of the reproductive period49,79. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) varied throughout the study period, with the lowest values for females (0.417 ± 0.180) in May 2020 and the highest (1.596 ± 0.518) in February 2021. For males, the lowest HSI (0.357 ± 0.104) was recorded in May 2020, and the highest (1.569 ± 0.951) in August 2020. For the overall individuals, the lowest value was determined as 0.399 ± 0.159 in May 2020, and the highest value was determined as 1.443 ± 0.466 in February 2021. The HSI helps determine the portion of energy in the liver during every period except the reproductive period. Since most of the energy is spent on gonadal development during the reproductive period, therefore the HSI value is lower during this period49,79. In this study, it was determined that HSI values were lower during the reproductive period than in other periods.

In our study, it was determined that the age of golden grey mullet was distributed between 1 and 6 years of age and 40.70% of the individuals were in the 3-year-old age group. The smallest individual among the samples obtained was determined to be a 16.5 cm male and 1 year old, and the largest individual was a 6-year-old female with a total length of 38.8 cm. İlkyaz et al.57reported that the samples consisted of individuals between 0 and 4 years of age, Bilgin et al.58reported that the individuals were between 1 and 6 years of age and the 3rd age group was dominant. The age composition of the individuals was between 1 and 10 years of age reported by Kesiktaş59. Reis60reported that the samples were in the 0–5 year age group, and Hotos80reported that the maximum age of the individual was 8 years. The results of our study were consistent with those of other reported studies, except for Hotos80. Individuals of the same species inhabiting different habitats, the exploitation status of the fish, and differences in sampling methods can lead to variations between age groups81–83.

The length at first sexual maturity (Lm50) was calculated as 21.87 cm for females and 21.45 cm for males, with males reaching sexual maturity at a smaller size than females. Kesiktaş59calculated the Lm50value as 27.5 cm for males and 25.9 cm for females. Hotos84reported thatLiza auratareached sexual maturity at a length of 20 cm, Fazli et al.85reported the Lm50value as 28.4 cm, Ghaninejad et al.68reported the length at which females reached sexual maturity as 28.4 cm. Our results were consistent with those of Hotos84, but they differed from findings in other studies. Environmental factors and fishing effort also play a major role in sexual maturity. If the environment where the fish live is suitable, the fish can delay reproduction. If they live in an unfavourable environment, growth is slow and the survival chance of adult fish is lower, so sexual maturation also can occur at a younger age and smaller sizes. Fishes that live in productive environmental conditions without fishing pressure grow much better and start reproducing at an older age86. According to Communiqué (No. 6/1), which regulates commercial fishing activities in Türkiye, the minimum landing size (MLS) of the golden grey mullet (C. auratus) is specified as 30 cm TL87. Considering the Lm50values of the golden grey mullet estimated in this study in terms of fisheries management and the fishing legislations in Türkiye, it is evaluated that the MLS limit set for the golden grey mullet is appropriate and should continue to be applied if it is not less than this size.

The gonadosomatic index (GSI) is a parameter that generally facilitates interpretations of the spawning season and sexual maturity process of fish species88,89. When the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) values of female and male individuals were examined in our study, it was determined that the highest value for both sexes was recorded in August. Various studies reported that the GSI values were the highest in September59,67,77,85. Bilgin et al.58determined that the GSI value of both sexes was the highest in September and decreased rapidly in October and that the golden grey mullet inhabiting the Central Black Sea coast (Sinop - Samsun region) had a short reproductive period. Similarly, based on our findings we determined that the reproductive season of the golden grey mullet started in August and ended in September having a relatively short reproductive period. Reis60reported the reproductive period between October and January in Koycegiz Lagoon (Mediterranean coast), and Koutrakis et al.90reported this period forL. auratabetween October and December in a study conducted in Porto-Lagos lagoon, Greece. Abdallah et al.91reported that according to the GSI values, the reproductive period from October to December in their study conducted in the Gulf of Gabes, Tunisia, in the Central Mediterranean. Under natural conditions, environmental factors have a significant effect on the reproductive period of fish. At this point, different environments, temperature, nutrient quality and quantity in the environment, and growth differences between different populations cause differences in the reproductive periods of the fish. To manage the fisheries rationally, it is crucial to accurately determine the reproductive period of each fish species for the implementation of fishing bans. According to Communiqué (No. 6/1), which regulates the commercial fishing activities in Türkiye, the fishing ban in all Turkish marine waters covers the period between April 15 and September 187. In terms of fishery management to protect and provide the sustainability of golden grey mullet stocks in the Black Sea, it does not appear to be any negative situation between the reproductive period determined in this study and the fishing ban implemented in the Turkish Seas.

The grey mullet catch in the Turkish Black Sea has shown considerable variations over the years. Notably, it has declined from 14,189 tons in 2000 to 172.7 tons by 202426. This trend invites an important attention and consideration as we explore effective strategies for sustainability and resource management in this vital sector. Unfortunately, mullet landings are generally not recorded to the species level due to identification difficulties and do not incorporate recreational catches28.C. auratusis often lumped under “grey mullet” in the national statistics. There’s no species-specific official catch data published. This study aimed to shed light on the population dynamics, reproductive biology, age, and growth ofC. auratusfrom the southeastern Black Sea to provide basic biological data needed for sustainable fisheries management in the region.

Sustainable stock management relies on accurate biological information. This data supports informed decision-making, stock preservation, and sustainable catches. Effective management depends on the quality, continuity, and accessibility of biological data. In conclusion, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological characteristics ofC. auratus. These results provide valuable data for future comparative studies and offer essential insights for policymakers aiming to promote sustainable fisheries management and the protection of golden grey mullet stocks in the Black Sea. To benefit from the golden grey mullet stocks in the Black Sea at an optimum level, it is necessary to continuously monitor its stocks with similar studies to have more accurate and continuous information about possible changes in the stock status and, accordingly, to update the recommendations to be made depending on the fishing season for the fishing density in the stock. However, further research on a targeted long-term monitoring and assessment approach forC. auratus, including stock size, recruitment, exploitation status and rates, length-age structure, and catch rates will be essential for sustainable exploitation. Insufficient dedicated fisheries data makes management of this species difficult. Moreover, species-specific official catch data are crucial for accurate monitoring, stock assessment, and the development of effective fisheries management strategies for this species.
