Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, a leading cause of global disability and mortality, encompass a wide range of brain disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and so on. These diseases are characterized by dynamic cellular heterogeneity and disrupted intercellular crosstalk, yet their molecular drivers remain incompletely resolved. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) dissects transcriptional diversity at cellular resolution, while spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps niche‐specific interactions within tissue architecture—complementary approaches that have revealed disease‐associated subpopulations, neural–glial communication, and microenvironmental remodeling. However, standalone omics layers inadequately capture the genetic, epigenetic, and functional cascades underlying CNS pathologies. Here, we highlight the transformative potential of integrating scRNA‐seq and ST with multiomic profiling to delineate spatially orchestrated molecular networks. Such multiomic convergence enables systematic deconstruction of molecular mechanisms and intercellular communication across disease progression. By correlating these signatures with clinical phenotypes, this strategy accelerates biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and therapeutic target identification. We further discuss challenges in data harmonization, subcellular spatial resolution, and computational scalability that must be addressed to realize personalized CNS medicine. This synthesis advocates for interdisciplinary frameworks to translate multiomic insights into mechanistically grounded diagnostics and therapies, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular discovery and precision clinical intervention.

Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are driven by spatiotemporally dynamic molecular networks. Single‐cell and spatial multiomics technologies dissect cellular heterogeneity, microenvironmental remodeling, and intercellular crosstalk. Integration of transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic layers reveals disease‐associated regulatory circuits and accelerates precision diagnostics and therapies.

Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke, collectively represent a leading global health burden, driven by complex cellular and molecular interplay that remains poorly resolved. Traditional bulk omics approaches obscure critical cell‐type‐specific dynamics [1], while emerging single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) have begun dissecting CNS pathologies at unprecedented resolution [2,3,4]. ScRNA‐seq delineates transcriptional heterogeneity across neuronal, glial, and immune subpopulations in neurodegeneration [5,6], whereas ST preserves spatial context to map disease‐associated niche interactions [7,8]. Despite these advances, standalone transcriptomic layers fail to capture the multilayered genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic cascades underlying cellular dysregulation [9,10]. For instance, posttranscriptional modifications and metabolic reprogramming in AD astrocytes are inadequately profiled by RNA‐centric methods alone [11].

Integrating scRNA‐seq and ST with epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets offers a transformative lens to decode spatially orchestrated molecular networks [12,13]. Such multiomic convergence has revealed regulatory hierarchies in neuroinflammation [14], synaptic metabolic coupling [15], and microenvironmental crosstalk in ischemic stroke (IS) [16]. For example, combined ATAC‐seq and scRNA‐seq identified enhancer landscapes driving microglial activation in AD [17], which underscore the potential to deconstruct CNS diseases across molecular layers, linking genomic variants to functional pathways and clinical phenotypes.

However, critical challenges persist. Technical disparities in multiomic data resolution, spatial granularity, and computational integration limit mechanistic insights. Current ST platforms lack subcellular resolution to localize RNA–protein interactions, while crossmodal data harmonization requires advanced machine learning frameworks [18]. Addressing these gaps is pivotal for translating multiomic signatures into biomarkers and therapies, such as circuit‐specific neuromodulation [19].

This review synthesizes advances in CNS multiomics, compared with the existing researches. Our review not only focuses on the mainstream CNS diseases, but also places significant emphasis on conditions where single‐cell and spatial analyses remain scarce, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We move beyond merely summarizing applications of individual technologies to pioneer a discussion on the integration of scRNA‐seq and ST data with other multiomics datasets. This deeply integrated analytical strategy surpasses the limitations of single‐technology approaches, aiming to elucidate a more comprehensive understanding of the pathological process in CNS diseases. Furthermore, we specifically highlight findings possessing clinical translational potential, emphasizing their role in precise diagnosis, individual treatment, and drug development. We critically evaluate technical frontiers, clinical translation potential, and interdisciplinary strategies to bridge molecular discovery with therapeutic innovation.

ScRNA‐seq enables high‐resolution transcriptional profiling of individual cells, overcoming the limitations of bulk sequencing in resolving cellular heterogeneity. The advent of scRNA‐seq enables transcriptional profiling at single‐cell resolution, overcoming the limitations of bulk sequencing in resolving cellular heterogeneity. Recent years have witnessed rapid evolution in single‐cell sequencing technologies, marked by significant advancements in throughput, efficiency, gene detection sensitivity, and cost effectiveness. Here, we introduce the fundamental workflow of scRNA‐seq and highlight key technological improvements (Figure1).

Workflow of single‐cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics technologies. In single‐cell RNA sequencing, first single‐cell or ‐nuclei suspensions are generated from the tissue, then suspensions are encapsulated in nanoliter droplets containing barcode beads using a microfluidic device. Post cell lysis, capture of polyadenylated RNA, reverse transcription, introduction of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and cell barcodes, and cDNA amplification and fragmentation, next‐generation sequencing is performed on cDNA library. After sequencing, a dimensionality reduction algorithm can be used to visualize high‐dimensional single‐cell RNA sequencing data to reveal cell clusters. In spatial transcriptomics, tissues are placed on mRNA capture slides for sectioning, fixing, and permeabilization to release RNA. The poly‐A tail of mRNA binds to the oligonucleotide (dT) terminal segment on the capture DNA probes, which also include locational barcodes. After library preparation and sequencing, computational analysis involves retrieving positional barcodes and tissue coordinates to reconstruct the relationship between transcripts and their locations. This figure was created using Figdraw.

Effective single‐cell suspension preparation with preserved viability is critical. Early low‐throughput methods (mechanical micromanipulation, laser capture microdissection) have been superseded by high‐throughput platforms, including microfluidics (e.g., 10x Genomics Chromium) and droplet‐based systems. These technologies coencapsulate cells with barcoded gel beads in emulsions, enabling simultaneous processing of thousands of cells while preserving transcriptomic integrity [20,21].

Given the picogram‐scale RNA yield per cell, cDNA amplification is essential. Common strategies include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in vitro transcription (IVT) [22]. PCR‐based template‐switching oligonucleotide methods dominate due to their efficiency, despite inherent amplification biases (e.g., 3′ coverage skews in IVT) [22]. Unique molecular identifiers are integrated to mitigate PCR duplication artifacts, ensuring quantitative accuracy [23].

Post sequencing, raw data undergo quality control, normalization, and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP/t‐SNE) prior to clustering. Differential gene expression analysis identifies subpopulation‐specific markers, enabling pseudotime trajectory inference to map cellular dynamics [24]. Advanced tools like SCENIC reconstruct gene regulatory networks by linking transcription factor activity to expression patterns [25]. Functional enrichment analyses, such as Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, further contextualize subcluster phenotypes within pathways such as immune activation or cell cycle regulation. This pipeline's resolution has redefined our understanding of cellular diversity, offering mechanistic insights into disease progression and therapeutic targets.

Currently, microdroplet‐based scRNA‐seq, exemplified by the 10x Chromium platform (10X), represents the most widely adopted approach. The 10X protocol enables high cell capture efficiency at relatively low cost while minimizing manual handling, thereby facilitating the generation of large‐scale single‐cell datasets [26]. Consequently, 10X is particularly advantageous for identifying rare cell subtypes and delineating cellular communication networks in complex systems, which is critical for elucidating unique pathological mechanisms in CNS diseases [27]. However, this method exhibits pronounced 3′‐end bias in mRNA reads, potentially reducing gene detection sensitivity [28]. In contrast, Smart‐seq2 generates full‐length transcript libraries with more uniform coverage across mRNA transcripts, demonstrating superior sensitivity for gene detection [28,29]. This approach is therefore better suited for profiling low‐abundance transcripts and investigating cell–cell interactions [28], making it widely applicable in CNS disease research focused on gene expression dynamics and transcriptional states in specific cell populations [30,31]. However, compared with droplet‐based methods like 10X, Smart‐seq2 still has lower throughput and high cost, limiting its application in large‐scale studies.

Recent methodological innovations have significantly expanded the resolution of single‐cell transcriptomics. Mahat et al. [32] developed single‐cell global run‐on sequencing (scGRO‐seq), a breakthrough technology that overcomes critical limitations of conventional poly(A)‐dependent scRNA‐seq. By leveraging copper‐catalyzed azide‐alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC or click chemistry), scGRO‐seq directly captures nascent RNA transcripts genome‐wide within individual cells, enabling unprecedented temporal and spatial analysis of transcriptional dynamics. Notably, the emergence of UDA‐seq, a universal workflow incorporating a postindexing step, has enhanced throughput by systematically adapting existing droplet‐based multimodal methods [33]. UDA‐seq achieves ultra‐high throughput and data quality comparable to 10X while significantly expanding sample sizes and cellular coverage depth. This advancement enables robust identification of rare cell phenotypes, positioning it as an ideal platform for large‐scale, multisample scRNA‐seq studies, such as constructing comprehensive cellular atlases of the CNS.

This emerging technology was first presented in 2016 [4]. Recently, the mainstream ST technology can be divided into the imaging‐based methods and the sequencing‐based methods (Table1).

All data were systematically retrieved from PubMed, employing the following search query syntax: (method name) AND (spatial transcriptomics) NOT (review[publication type] OR review[Title/Abstract]). The literature search was conducted up to July 23, 2025, ensuring inclusion of the most recent and relevant studies while excluding review articles.

Different from imaging‐based methods, sequencing‐based methods provide low resolution, but its advantages of large coverage and no bias make it still one of the mainstream methods of ST (Figure1).

Slide‐seq was developed in 2019 [39], which uses microparticles called “beads” to measure the expression of the whole genome at a resolution of 10 µm. Each bead is coated on the slide and modified with 500 spatial barcode reverse transcription primers. After the capture of mRNA, the barcode on each bead is determined through sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection technology to generate the spatial information of barcode. Shortly after Slide‐seq, high‐definition ST (HDST) was developed [40], with beads loaded in a large number of small holes on the slide. Compared with Slide‐seq, HDST uses smaller beads to construct a higher density array. Deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT‐seq) does not depend on the spatial barcode oligonucleotide array fixed on slide [42]. In DBiT‐seq, arrays are “printed” onto tissues through the microfluidic channel. The microfluidic channel modifies 50 rows of barcodes for tissue sections by negative pressure injection, and followed by 50 rows of barcodes in the vertical direction in the same way. Each point can be identified with a unique pair combination. Stereo‐seq combined DNA nanoball pattern arrays with in situ RNA capture techniques [45]. Compared with other ST technologies, Stereo‐seq had a large field of view, nanoscale resolution, high sensitivity, and uniform capture rate. Expansion ST (Ex‐ST) embeds tissue sections in a polyacrylamide gel to anchor RNA, which overcomes the limitations of array density and achieves higher spatial resolution [46]. Open‐ST transforms Illumina flow cytometers into ST capture areas by utilizing patterned flow cytometry technology to generate densely barcoded regions [47], enabling the capture of polyadenylated RNA from tissue sections. This approach achieves precise identification of distinct cell types and their molecular characteristics at a higher spatial resolution. Furthermore, it allows for the computational integration of two‐dimensional data into three‐dimensional (3D) virtual tissue blocks, which are applicable to a wide range of tissue types.

However, these methods are still inadequate to reflect the actual single‐cell level transcripts in space because cells often span multiple capture regions; hence, transcripts inferred from multiple small pixels have inherent limitations in their correspondence to true single‐cell level data. To overcome this limitation, sci‐Space and XYZeq have integrated the scRNA‐seq with ST technology [49,51], also using a spatial barcode array, to label cells rather than capturing mRNA, and after assigning spatial barcodes to each cell, scRNA‐seq is used on cells with spatial information. Spotiphy is a toolkit designed to address the trade‐offs in gene coverage [52], capable of transforming sequencing‐based ST data into whole‐transcriptome images with pseudo‐single‐cell resolution. The highlight of this protocol lies in its integration of the most informative genes for each cell type and the nuclear positions into a probabilistic model, which takes into account the contribution of each cell type to gene expression. This enables the deconvolution and decomposition of ST data, generating cell type proportions and inferred scRNA data (iscRNA data). Subsequently, Gaussian processes are employed to interpolate the cell type proportions and iscRNA data in noncaptured regions, producing whole‐slide pseudo‐single‐cell resolution whole‐transcriptome images.

Two main technologies are mature, including in situ sequencing (ISS)‐based methods and in situ hybridization (ISH)‐based ST methods [73,74,75].

The current mainstream ISH method is to combine fluorescence ISH (FISH) with scRNA‐seq, and nucleotide probes with different fluorescent stains with the target RNA, using one color for each hybridization. Eight rounds of hybridization are sufficient to resolve all genes in the human genome. Single‐molecule FISH (smFISH) is the first ST technique started in FISH [54], which used digital imaging microscope to in situ detect oligonucleic acid probes modified with fluorescent in individual cells that hybridize to specific mRNA, thus, can determine the abundance of intracellular transcripts and achieve spatial localization [76]. However, due to the spectral limitation, only a few targets RNA can be detected at a time. Compared with smFISH, the advantage of sequential FISH (seqFISH) is in each hybridization [56], FISH probe is labeled with a single color to each transcript, after hybridization, imaging and probe stripping, the number of FNspecies transcripts have been barcoded, which can cover the entire transcriptome (F: number of fluorophores, N: number of hybridization rounds). However, due to the high density of mRNA in cells, optical crowding occurs during fluorescence hybridization, which is not conducive to the analysis of mRNA; thus, seqFISH was further developed to seqFISH+ [77], using more than 60 kinds of pseudocolor expanded the barcode base color and divided them into three fluorescent channels; barcodes were generated only within each fluorescent channel, to ensure the building of super resolution image.

Despite seqFISH is able to detect RNA targets at levels of up to 10, 000 transcripts per cell, the researchers have to face questions during the experiment like high detection errors, time consuming, and high costs. Multiplexed error‐robust FISH (MERFISH) was developed in 2015 [59]; during this method, RNA is hybridized with 192 coding probes consisting of a targeting sequence with two readout fluorescent probes. In each round of hybridization, each gene was assigned a binary bit coding; the number of bits correspond to the number of hybridization rounds, then align them with the designed targeting barcode to obtain the specific information of the RNA. Tris buffer‐mediated retention of ISH chain reaction signal in cleared organs (TRISCO) was developed recently [60]; this emerging protocol enhances the RNA probe signals in deep brain regions by adjusting the staining temperature, thereby achieving 3D RNA imaging across the entire brain.

The basic principle of ISS technology is as follows: first, mRNA in specific tissues and cells is reverse transcribed into cDNA, the lock probe is specifically combined with the target cDNA sequence, and the probe is loop by DNA polymerase. Through rolling‐circle amplification (RCA), the nucleic acid information of the target region is amplified. Finally, the RCA products were sequenced to achieve decoding of transcriptome information and mapping of spatial information [62]. Fluorescence ISS (FISSEQ) enables nontargeting RNA capture [64], using random primers to generate cDNA and crosslink cDNA to the cellular environment, to loop and link cDNA by single‐stranded DNA cyclase. Spatially resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping (STARmap) improved ISS by applying CLARITY‐based hydrogel‐tissue chemistry, SNAIL probes, and sequencing with error‐reduction by dynamic annealing and ligation [66]. Furthermore, the method also retains the directionality of cells and, therefore, allows for 3D spatial analysis of tissue samples [78]. Barcode in situ targeted sequencing (BaristaSeq) was an improved version of gap padlock probe‐based method and relies on padlocks [67]. During this approach, there is a gap between the two arms of the padlock probe, which DNA polymerase is used to fill before the circularization of padlock probe. This procedure copies a portion of the cDNA into the RCA template, replicated barcodes were then sequenced in situ. Since then, Chen et al. [70,71] have continued to developed barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing (BARseq) and BARseq2.

The integration of single‐cell and spatial multiomics with epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets is revolutionizing our understanding of CNS diseases. Below, we outline key advancements and validated applications supported by published studies.

Single‐cell epigenomics, such as single‐cell assay for transposase‐accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC‐seq) and single‐cell cleavage under targets and tagmentation [79,80], identifies cell‐type‐specific chromatin states, while spatial epigenomics (e.g., spatial‐CUT&Tag and Epigenomic MERFISH) [81,82] resolves regulatory elements within tissue niches. Combined, these approaches reveal disease‐associated epigenetic dysregulation. For example, by integrating scATAC‐seq data with published snRNA‐seq datasets, researchers constructed gene regulatory networks in adult mouse brain regions, focusing on the transcription factorJun, to investigate its role in spinal cord regeneration [83].

Single‐cell proteomics quantifies surface protein heterogeneity, including cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE‐seq) [84] and RNA expression and protein sequencing [85], whereas spatial proteomics localizes intercellular signaling hubs, such as multiplexed ion beam imaging by time‐of‐flight [86], cellular detection by expression of multiple proteins (CODEX) [87], 3D imaging of solvent‐cleared organs profiled by mass spectrometry (DISCO–MS) [88], label‐based unlimited multiplexed DNA‐PAINT (SUM‐PAINT) [89]. Their synergy maps ligand–receptor dynamics across niches, for example, to reveal the distribution, function, and other cell–cell interactions between innate immune cells and surrounding cells (endothelial cells and fibroblasts) at the CNS border [90].

Single‐cell metabolomics currently encompasses two mainstream methodologies: mass spectrometry‐based single‐cell metabolomics approaches, such as matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization–mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI–MSI) [91], and flow cytometry‐based single‐cell metabolic profiling approaches, including Met‐Flow [92]. Both approaches enable the capture of cellular metabolic heterogeneity. While spatial metabolomics maps metabolite gradients across tissue architectures, emerging techniques like spatial single nuclear metabolomics display multiscale and multicolor tissue tomography together with the identification and clustering of single nuclei by their in situ metabolic fingerprints [93]. Integrated analysis of scRNA‐seq, Visium, and air flow‐assisted desorption electrospray ionization (AFADESI)–MSI [94] reveals spatial heterogeneity in gene expression and metabolic alterations following traumatic brain injury. For instance,S1pr5‐high regions exhibit elevated phosphatidylcholine PC(44:7) levels, whileSeptin4‐high regions correlate with reduced aspartate distribution.

In a result, integrating single‐cell and spatial multiomics with epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data revolutionizes CNS disease understanding. This synergy deciphers spatial regulatory logic, maps functional cell–cell crosstalk, and links metabolic states to tissue niches, revealing related‐CNS disease mechanisms.

With the decreasing cost of next‐generation sequencing and improvement in computational power, microscopy, and imaging, scRNA‐seq and ST have been widely used to meet the demands of researchers. These methods help identify cell populations associated with CNS diseases such as stroke, AD, PD, and glioblastoma (GBM). Combined with multiomic data analysis methods, researchers can understand the pathological characteristics around the damaged area. These include neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and other repair mechanisms, such as remyelination [95,96].

During the acute phase of IS, intense neuroinflammation is associated with neuronal damage and worse neurological outcomes [97]. Microglia play a crucial role in poststroke immune inflammation [98]. However, the heterogeneity and involved mechanisms of microglia remain unclear. In an experiment combining scRNA‐seq and ST to sequence microglia in the ischemic hemisphere of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice, researchers identified two spatially specific subpopulations as ischemic core‐associated microglia (ICAM) and ischemic penumbra‐associated microglia [99]. Gene set variation analysis indicated that compared with the other clusters, the expression of proinflammatory and inflammatory response genes increased in ICAM. In 2022, researchers developed a new mouse model of late reperfusion transient IS, allowing them to create a comprehensive profile of immune cell populations in the brains of aged mice affected by stroke at single‐cell resolution [100]. At least six microglial subsets were discovered in the aged brain following stroke. Among them, MG6 cells expressed high levels ofCxcr2,S100a8, interleukin (IL)‐1β, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), demonstrating a unique “neutrophil‐like” phenotype and were considered to represent a stroke‐specific state of microglia in the aged brain after stroke. Furthermore, microglia in the aged brain poststroke have been found to significantly upregulateinterferon alpha‐inducible protein 27 like 2A(Ifi27l2a) [101]. The upregulation ofIfi27l2aexpression is consistent with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines such asIl1b,Cst7, andLyz2, suggesting thatIfi27l2amay be involved in promoting inflammatory responses following stroke. Hemizygous deletion ofIfi27l2a(Ifi27l2a±mice) reduced cerebral infarct volumes, neuroinflammation, and motor function deficits, indicating thatIfi27l2ais a key mediator of stroke‐ and aging‐related neuroinflammation (Figure2A).

Cellular changes post ischemic stroke revealed by single‐cell and spatial multiomics. (A) At the acute stage of ischemic stroke (IS), microglia (MG) in the ischemic core changes to ischemic core‐associated microglia (ICAM), which has high expression of proinflammatory genes. Additionally, a subset of MG in the aged brain post IS also highly express proinflammatory genes. (B) Ischemia–reperfusion injury post IS activates endothelial cells and monocytes to degrade adhesion proteins, thereby undermining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. (C) During the subacute stage of IS, myeloid cells induce the migration of proliferating glial cells to the lesional rim by osteopontin–CD44 signaling, promoting the formation of glial scars. (D) During the chronic stage of IS, MG promotes the proliferation of OPC through LAGLS9–CD44 signaling. Na+/H+exchanger‐1 (NHE1) in MG regulates intracellular pH to mediate demyelination effect, selective deletion of NHE1 can regulate MG‐oligodendrocyte interaction through CREB1 signaling to promote oligodendrocyte proliferation and remyelination.

This figure was created using Figdraw.

Blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage is another marker of early brain damage in IS [102], leading to the entry of numerous peripheral substances and immune cells into the brain parenchyma and eventually aggravating the neurological function deficit [103]. Translocation and degradation of tight junction proteins mediated translocation across cells and paracellular barrier opening are two crucial modes of permeability [104]. Leucine rich alpha‐2‐glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is considered an induced signaling molecule following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [105]. A 2023 study found that LRG1 deletion reduced brain edema and infarct size following cerebral I/R injury and improved neurological function [106]. ScRNA‐seq analysis revealed that LRG1 knockout could promote the BBB by upregulating tight junction proteins, such as claudin 11, integrin β5, protocadherin 9, and annexin A2. Peripheral immune cells exhibit a dual role in IS, influenced by the microenvironment and the poststroke time window [107,108]. Single‐cell transcriptome sequencing of peripheral blood from mice at various time points after I/R identified a monocyte subset with high expression ofcathepsin S(Ctss). AfterCtssknockout, the infarct area, neurologic function scores, apoptosis, and vascular leakage were significantly reduced. Additionally,Ctsscould disrupt BBB by binding to the junctional adhesion molecule family proteins to cause their degradation. Furthermore, analysis of three transcriptome sequencing datasets from mouse MCAO/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mice identified eight genes that were downregulated in endothelial cells [109]. The transcriptome analysis of the BBB (cortex) and non‐BBB (lung) endothelial from E13.5 mice identified 2102 genes that exhibited upregulation and may be associated with the integrity of the BBB. By intersecting the downregulated eight genes with the 2102 BBB‐related genes, researchers found thatsolute carrier family 22 member 8(Slc22a8) was specifically expressed in endothelial cells and pericytes, and its expression significantly decreased after MCAO/R. The use of a lentivirus carrying Tie2 to exogenously overexpressSlc22a8improved the levels ofSlc22a8and tight junction proteins after MCAO/R. This intervention also reduced BBB leakage and activated the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway, suggesting that the downregulation ofSlc22a8induced by MCAO/R may be a crucial mechanism in BBB disruption (Figure2B).

Directing at the subacute phase of IS, researchers utilized scRNA‐seq and smFISH to uncover the diversity of microglia and monocyte‐derived cells [110]. Monocyte‐derived cells were observed to differentiate along two primary trajectories poststroke: one giving rise to macrophages with pronounced phagocytic and metabolic characteristics, and the other differentiating into dendritic cells (DCs) endowed with antigen‐presenting capabilities. These cells exhibit specific spatial distributions within the poststroke brain and play a pivotal role in the immunomodulatory processes of brain repair by regulating their transcriptional profiles and differentiation trajectories. Furthermore, an increase in both microglia and monocyte‐derived macrophages was noted, sharing identical transcriptional signatures, suggesting that macrophages may compensate for microglial insufficiency. Besides, during the subacute phase, reactive glial cells surrounding the lesion core transiently proliferate and form glial scars [111,112]. Following ischemic injury, gene expression profiles and spatial information for astrocyte clusters at different time points were revealed [113]. ScRNA‐seq and ST inferred breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) as a specific transcriptional regulator implicated in the proliferation of cluster 12, a spatiotemporally restricted subgroup associated with proliferation putatively. Moreover, researchers have integrated multiple platforms to investigate cellular heterogeneity after IS [114]. As a spatially resolved single‐cell omics platform, tissue‐digital microfluidic isolation of single cells for ‐Omics (tDISCO) can use transcriptomics and proteomics to distinguish between proximal and distal astrocytes. Using tDISCO, researchers found that proximal astrocytes exhibited differences in lipid shuttling, with an enriched expression ofapolipoprotein(Apoe) andfatty acid binding protein 5(Fabp5). Similarly, another study has revealed a single‐cell resolution transcriptomics dataset that explores the acute response of the rat brain to infarction using snRNA‐seq [115]. They found that infarction‐restricted proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), mature oligodendrocytes, and reactive astrocytes share transcriptional similarities in response to ischemic injury. OPCs and reactive astrocytes are involved in shared immuno‐glial crosstalk with stroke‐specific myeloid cells. Within the perilesional zone, osteopontin (OPN)‐positive myeloid cells accumulate closely to CD44+proliferating OPCs and reactive astrocytes. In vitro, OPN enhances the OPC migration but does not affect their proliferation (Figure2C).

The loss of brain function following an IS is often difficult to recover. However, rehabilitation can partially improve the functional prognosis of patients [116,117], suggesting the existence of cerebral self‐recovery mechanisms postinjury [118,119]. These recovery processes are driven by various neurotrophic factors or regulators of neurite projection or synaptogenesis in the injured area [120,121]. By integrating spatial and single‐cell transcriptomics, researchers confirmed the spatial annotation of gene expression associated with ischemia in the peri‐infarct area of the ischemic hemisphere [122]. Ligand–receptor interaction analysis in cell communication indicated the galectin‐9 to cell‐surface glycoprotein CD44 (LGALS9–CD44) as a key signaling pathway following ischemic injury, with microglia and macrophages serving as the primary sources of galectin‐9 poststroke. Extracellular vesicle‐mediated delivery of LGALS9 improved long‐term functional recovery in mice with photothrombotic stroke, while CD44 knockdown partially reversed these therapeutic effects, inhibiting oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin regeneration. Microglial Na+/H+exchanger‐1 (NHE1) protein, encoded bySlc9a1, has been implicated in white matter (WM) demyelination in IS [123]. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, researchers performed scRNA‐seq on WM tissue from conditionalSlc9a1knockout (cKO) and wild‐type mice 3 days poststroke [96]. They identified five microglia and five oligodendrocyte subpopulations, with the MG3 and OL5 subpopulations expanded in NHE1–cKO WM tissue. These subpopulations exhibited a series of myelin sheath support genes. Additionally, CellChat [124] analysis revealed enhanced interaction of the prosaposin (in microglia)/G protein‐coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) (in oligodendrocyte) ligand–receptor pair in NHE1‐cKO brain WM, suggesting a potential mechanism for promoting OPC proliferation and differentiation, thereby enhancing WM myelin regeneration (Figure2D). To determine the mechanism of age‐related decline in cerebrovascular and WM repair/regeneration after stroke, another study performed single‐cell transcriptomic profiling of brain tissue from young adult and aged mouses following ischemic injury [125]. The data revealed that the interaction between microglia/macrophages (MG/MΦ) and endothelial cells/oligodendrocyte lineage cells can promote tissue repair process. Notably, transplantation of young MG/MΦ into aged postischemic mice rejuvenated their behavioral performance.

As the main type of hemorrhagic stroke, ICH is characterized by bleeding into the brain parenchyma, with mechanisms of its damage involving the complex interplay between edema, inflammation, iron‐induced injury, and oxidative stress [126]. Based on scRNA‐seq and ST, a recent study discovered that during the acute phase following ICH, myeloid cells and lymphocytes associated with macrophages exhibit close interactions in the choroid plexus region of the brain ventricles [127]. Specifically,Lgmn+Macro−T cells activate microglia through the secreted phosphoprotein‐1 (SPP1)–CD44 pathway, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby exacerbating local inflammatory responses. Similarly, by analyzing the single‐cell suspensions from the hemorrhagic region of the ipsilateral striatum in a WM hemorrhage (WMH) model mouse [128], researchers revealed that post‐ICH WMH displayed a transition of homeostatic microglia into proinflammatory, anti‐inflammatory, and proliferative states, thereby affecting lipid metabolic pathways. Besides, myeloid cells amplified the expression of chemokines associated with ferroptosis pathways. Macrophages exhibited M2 phenotype predominance, characterized by their anti‐inflammatory properties. An increase in OPC proliferation aligned with enhanced ribosomal signaling, suggesting a potential reparative response following WMH.

Post ICH, perihematomal edema (PHE) encompasses complex pathophysiological mechanisms that are currently poorly understood. Given the role of PHE in secondary brain injury, the development of effective immunomodulatory therapies targeting PHE may offer a novel therapeutic approach for ICH. ScRNA‐seq was conducted on a small amount of edematous tissue surrounding the hematoma from three groups of patients (0–6, 6–24, and 24–48 h post‐ICH) with basal ganglia hemorrhage, revealing a comprehensive landscape of various immune cell populations in human PHE tissue at a single‐cell level [129]. During the progression of PHE, a SPP1 pathway was identified as a key mechanism for communication among microglial subclusters. Additionally, OPN produced by microglia can regulate the immune environment in PHE tissue by interacting with CD44‐positive cells. This finding expands our understanding of the immune microenvironment within PHE tissue.

AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. While more refined classifications of AD genotypes and phenotypes are now available, the disease is broadly categorized into highly permeable autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) or sporadic AD, which arises from a complex interplay of genetic risk and environmental factors. However, the dysregulated pathways driving both sporadic AD and ADAD remain unknown, as do the molecular consequences of their slightly different complications. Single‐cell and spatial multiomics may uncover the underlying genotypes and cell networks associated with AD etiology and pathological features.

APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset AD and has been reported to exacerbate AD‐related pathologies [130,131], including amyloid‐β (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation [132,133,134,135,136]. Blanchard et al. [137] combined with snRNA‐seq and lipidomics analysis, confirmed thatApoe4could lead to abnormal cholesterol deposition in oligodendrocytes, thus affecting the myelination function of oligodendrocytes and leading to cognitive decline. Integrating phosphoproteomic and proteomic analyses,Apoe4was found to cause early disruptions in the BBB transcriptomeApoe4knock‐in mice compared withApoe3[138]. In middle‐agedAPOE4mice, endothelial cells upregulatedTspan3andTcf20while pericytes upregulatedCyr61, increasing the expression of BBB‐degrading enzymes MMP1 and MMP3 and decreasing the expression of the extracellular matrix protein collagen 1 [139]. This dysregulation may exacerbate BBB permeability, leading to a damaged response.APOE4has also been linked to lipid droplet accumulation in microglia and neurotoxic microglial‐derived factors [140]. SnRNA‐seq revealed a microglial state in AD characterized by the expression of the lipid droplet‐associated enzymeacyl‐CoA synthetase long‐chain family member 1(Acsl1), withAcsl1‐positive microglia being most abundant in patients with AD with theApoe4/4genotype. Mechanistically, Aβ inducedAcsl1expression, triglyceride synthesis, and lipid droplet accumulation in an APOE‐dependent manner. Additionally, conditioned media from lipid droplet‐containing microglia promoted tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in an APOE‐dependent manner. Notably, a single residue changes between the APOE4 and APOE3 isoforms alters protein structure and function in two domains [141,142], thereby directly or indirectly modifying the binding of APOE to various cell surface receptors [143,144]. Recently, the homozygousApoe3–Christchurch(Apoe3–CC) variant was reported to confer resistance to early‐onset AD caused by the PSEN1–E280A mutation [145]. Integrating snRNA‐seq data from the frontal and occipital cortices of a patient with theApoe3–CCvariant revealed an upregulation of LDL receptor related protein 1 in astrocytes and FKBP1B in excitatory neurons (Ex), facilitating tau uptake and spreading of tau within neurons [146,147]. Similarly, theApoe4–CCvariant was found to effectively prevent APOE4‐driven AD pathology [148]. SnRNA‐seq indicated thatApoe4–CCmutation increased the abundance of disease‐protective cell population while reducing the abundance of disease‐associated cell population in a gene‐dose‐dependent manner, thereby preventingApoe4‐induced AD pathology (Figure3).

Roles of APOE genes and its variants in Alzheimer's disease. APOE4 can promote tau uptake by neurons, while APOE4–CC variant can inhibit this process, additionally, APOE3–CC variant can clear tau by promoting tau uptake by astrocytes. In neurons, tau protein is phosphorylated and polymerized to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and APOE3–CC variant can activate FKBP51 to inhibit the aggregation of ptau. The increase of NFTs can activate a series of complex stress responses, leading to neuronal death. Extracellular Aβ is mainly cleared by microglia. Aβ can activate ACSL1 and PIK3CA in microglia to synthesize triglyceride, thereby promoting lipid droplet (LD) formation. APOE4–CC variant can inhibit the activation of ACSL1 by Aβ. On the one hand, intracellular LD can promote microglia‐mediated inflammation, on the other hand, LD can shuttle to the extracellular space and be engulfed by neurons, thereby promoting the phosphorylation of tau in neurons, this process is mediated by APOE4.

Obesity is another major risk factor for AD and its most common complication [149,150]. Notably, a high‐fat obesogenic diet was reported to accelerate recognition memory impairment in five human AD‐linked mutations (5xFAD) mice [151]. In obese 5xFAD mice, hippocampal cells exhibited minimal diet‐related transcriptional changes, while the spleen's immune landscape exhibited aging‐like dysregulation of CD4+T cells. Through plasma metabolite analysis, free N‐acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) was identified as the metabolite linking recognition memory impairment in mice to an increase in spleen immunosuppressive cells. snRNA‐seq revealed that mouse visceral fat macrophages may serve as a potential source of NANA. Furthermore, NANA was found to suppress CD4+T cell proliferation in mice and humans, inducing immunosenescence, and accelerating recognition memory damage in 5xFAD mice. Peripheral inflammation may affect the CNS and be a factor in AD pathophysiology [152]. Mice exposed toStaphylococcus aureus(Staph) through long‐term intranasal exposure have been reported to display an increased amyloid plaque burden along with increased plaque‐associated microglia in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice [153]. To investigate whether acute peripheral Staph infection can lead to specific molecular changes at amyloid plaque sites, researchers utilized ST to define unique Aβ plaque‐associated molecular signatures for the Staph group and phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) group. They found that many genes related to damage‐associated microglia were highly expressed in plaques from the Staph group than in those from the PBS group. These genes are involved in intracellular vesicular transport and immune signal transduction. Furthermore, compared with PBS, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein was higher in Staph plaques, indicating an increase in astrogliosis following acute Staph exposure.

Aβ is the primary component of amyloid plaques in AD, and its accumulation is considered a molecular driver of the onset and progression of AD [154]. The production of Aβ in the brain has mainly been believed to occur solely in neurons. However, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the single‐nucleus transcriptome profile from the cortex of a patient with AD revealed a significant positive enrichment of Aβ gene sets in oligodendrocytes, includingRab11a,Lrrtm3, andApp[155]. Single‐cell analysis of H1 embryonic stem cell line‐derived oligodendrocytes and Ex indicated that Aβ peptides derived from oligodendrocytes contributed to AD‐related amyloidosis similar to Ex. Oligodendrocytes have also been reported to promote Aβ plaque formation in the brains of AD mice by expressingβ‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1(Bace1) [156], the sole β‐secretase responsible for Aβ production. SnRNA‐seq results revealed that the deletion ofBace1in oligodendrocytes upregulates the expression of genes associated with Aβ generation and clearance, such asAdam10,Ano4,Apoe,Il33, andSort1. Disease‐associated astrocytes were identified in AD mice, characterized by a large increase with age [157]. In AD, DISCO–MS revealed heterogeneity of Aβ plaques in different brain regions, as well as significant involvement ofS100a,Ywhaz(14‐3‐3), vesicle fusion and transport, myelin sheath function, and the complement system related family members in early AB plaque development [88]. Based on snRNA‐seq, researchers have identified that the coexpression of lncRNA‐small nucleolar RNA host gene 14(Snhg14),myocardin related transcription factora (Mrtfa), andMrtfbacross multiple cell types is strongly associated with AD progression [158]. In neuronal and glial cell subpopulations coexpressing lncRNA‐Snhg14,Mrtfa, andMrtfb, calcium signaling and mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were found to be significantly enriched, which have been previously linked to Aβ plaque generation [159]. Molecular docking confirmed that lncRNA–Snhg14can interact with bothMrtfaandMrtfb, potentially facilitating crosstalk between neurons and glial cells.

A single‐nucleus transcriptomic study of brain microvasculature characterized the functional role of AD risk genes in the microvascular cells of the brain [160]. Integrating quantitative immunohistochemistry, researchers have determined that the pathological expression of connective tissue growth factor and secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC) impairs AD angiogenesis by counteracting the increased expression of proangiogenic factors, includingFgf2,Hif1a, andAngpt2, as pathological tissue Aβ and tau levels increase. Another study on cellular senescence examined postmortem brains from nondiseased controls (NDC) and donors with AD using imaging mass cytometry and snRNA‐seq [161]. Compared with NDC, the number of glial cells immunostained for galactosidase beta and p16INK4A—two widely used immunohistological biomarkers of senescence—was higher in AD, with the most notable increase observed in microglia. Gene set enrichment and pseudotime trajectories revealed extensive DNA double‐strand breaks, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress associated with increased Aβ, leading to premature senescence in microglia.

Misfolded tau is another key pathological feature in AD [162]. Currently, using scRNA‐seq and ST, researchers have acquired a deeper insight into the biomarkers associated with tau pathology. A recent study involving 337, 512 brain myeloid cells used snRNA‐seq to identify microglial populations associated with tau pathology [163]. They used expression patterns of early tau progression to identify genes whose expression was reversed along the spreading of spatial tau pathology. Moreover, they revealed the potential involvement of these “phasic” genes in the conversion of microglial subtypes to a diseased state. Notably, these transiently upregulated genes displayed significant overlap with genes exhibiting early tau pathology‐driven dysregulation, such asBach1andPrr5, demonstrating opposite expression patterns in the early stages of AD. The suppressor of MEK1 (SMEK1) is another regulatory protein of tau pathology, with its N‐terminal ran‐binding domain facilitating the binding tokinesin family member 2A(Kif2a) [164]. Researchers have recently identified a novel neuronal cluster with neurodegenerative features inSmek1−/−mice through single‐cell sequencing, characterized by cytoplasmic aggregation ofKif2a, axonal growth defects, and impaired mitochondrial axonal transport.Smek1deletion in mice activated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) through the protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, leading to excessive phosphorylation of tau at GSK3β sites. Conversely,Kif2adownregulation may ameliorate tau hyperphosphorylation and axonal growth defects in shSMEK1cells. Various types of neurons exhibit varying susceptibility to tau protein attacks [165]. To determine whether this susceptibility is due to differences in neuronal types or protein expression levels, scRNA‐seq profiles of mice were utilized to analyze individual cell types [166]. Tau protein was found to be highly expressed in nonsusceptible brain areas and cell types, indicating that its expression levels in brain regions are unrelated to susceptibility, while neuron type does affect their susceptibility. Furthermore, whole‐brain scRNA‐seq of human P301L tau transgenicDrosophilarevealed significant vulnerability of dopamine (DA) neurons and enhanced resilience of GABAergic neurons in substantia nigra. Screening predicted markers for tau vulnerability and resilience identified tau toxicity modifiers related to pathways and processes, such as “synaptic, ” “neuronal excitability, ” and “intracellular Ca2+homeostasis.” This indicated that genes related to prominent vulnerability/resilience to pathogenic tau are also genetic modifiers of tau‐induced neuronal dysfunction.

Prominent pathological hallmarks of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) in the substantia nigra dense body (SNc) and Lewy body formation in DaNs and cortical regions. Neuroinflammation also plays a critical role in PD pathophysiology. Single‐cell and spatial multiomics could further reveal new aspects of PD pathogenesis and identify intrinsic properties of cell types and subtypes.

DaNs demonstrate different vulnerabilities to degeneration. DaNs in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are severely affected, while ventral tegmental area (VTA) DaNs show great resistance to degeneration. To reveal cell intrinsic properties underlying the differential vulnerability of SNc and VTA DaNs, LCM‐seq has been used to reveal the transcriptional profiles of DaNs in the SNc and VTA, and bootstrapping coupled with DEseq2 demonstrate distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the SNc and VTA, which plays a crucial role in differentiating subpopulations of neurons, particularly in disease contexts [167]. The SNc markers SLIT1 and atpase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+transporting 3 (ATP2A3) were downregulated. SLIT1 appears to block neurite extension of DaNs [168], while lower level of ATP2A3 results in increased levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+[169], potentially serving as robust indicators of the vulnerability of SNc dopamine neurons. By contrast, STRING analysis highlight differences in regulation of mitochondrial stability, apoptosis, neuronal survival, cytoskeleton regulation, extracellular matrix modulation as well as synapse integrity, which could explain the relative resilience of VTA DaNs [167]. Moreover, scRNA‐seq and ST identified a single subtype confined to the ventral tier of SNpc was strongly enriched in the SOX6_AGTR1 pathway, which was highly susceptible to loss in PD. Epigenomic profiling (ATAC‐seq) revealed accessible chromatin regions near nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group f member 2 (NR2F2) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) in these cells, linking genetic risk to transcriptional dysregulation [6]. TP53 has been implicated in motor neuron death [170] while overexpression of NR2F2 has been found to repress expression of genes encoding cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases, which enhances oxidative stress and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction in PD [171]. Besides, a calcium‐dependent secretion activator 2 (CADPS2)−highsubtype believed to be a degenerated DaN in PD was identified [172]. CADPS2 has previously been linked to to catecholamine uptake and genetic PD [173,174], but the role of CADPS2 in the pathogenesis of PD still remains unknown.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear when and how this diversity among the neurons is generated. ScRNA‐seq allows tracking later maturation and continuous generation of gene expression diversity in midbrain dopaminergic(mDA)neurons to provide a comprehensive transcriptomic map describing mDA neuron maturation [175]. Researchers analyzed mDA neurons in Pitx3eGFP mice at six different time points from embryonic days 13.5 to postnatal days 90 by scRNA‐seq131. Validated by histological characterization, network analysis divided the defined seven neuronal subpopulations into two major branches of neurons expressing paired like homeodomain 3 (PITX3). Five of them expressed DA markers, while two expressed glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, respectively [175].

Progression of Lewy pathology to cortical regions is strongly associated with dementia of the most severe symptoms of PD [176,177,178,179]. ST revealed molecular changes in cortical neurons susceptible to Lewy pathology and aggregates [180]. Layer 5 intratelencephalic and Layer 6b neurons, as Ex, are vulnerable to developing Lewy pathology. Lewy‐associated molecular dysfunction from aggregates revealed that neurons with aggregates downregulate mitochondrial, synaptic, ubiquitin–proteasome, cytoskeletal, and endo‐lysosomal genes while upregulating DNA repair and complement/cytokine genes. Recent research has drawn similar conclusions through independent analysis and imaging of ST datasets [181]. Researchers reveal that Layer 5 intracortical neurons are particularly vulnerable to Lewy pathology and display overexpression ofSnca. However, this accounts for some but not all variance in pSyn pathology.Plk2expression indicates vulnerability to cortical and hippocampal pSyn pathology in α‐syn‐transgenic mice. It may have a potential for explaining differences in pSyn vulnerability with some cell types, as researchers observed a significant difference inPlk2expression between L5 IT Ex,pSyn+/human synuclein alpha (hSNCA)−low andpSyn−/hSNCA−high cells. Consequently, ST discloses the definite location and explains the molecular patterns of cortical neurons with vulnerability to α‐synuclein pathology in PD.

Neuroinflammation is one of the established pathogeneses of PD. Microglia, an immune cell that innately resides in the brain, develops and increases the release of IL‐1β and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) cytokines [182], which are involved in PD progression. Anti‐TNF‐α therapy may protect DaNs [183]. Recently, a study identified the activation states of microglia in the N‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐1, 2, 3, 6‐tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model, which may be mediated by two key transcriptional factors, nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NFE212) and runt‐related transcription factor (RUNX) [184]. The idiopathic PD midbrain was obtained by single‐nucleus RNA sequencing, revealing panglial activation as a central mechanism in the pathology of movement disorders [172]. An association between inflammatory cell activation in the inflammatory response and PD pathogenesis has been demonstrated. Pathway analysis found that microglia in the substantia nigra enriched the risk of PD. It strongly correlated with leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), promoted the formation of inflammasomes, and was characterized by elevated levels ofIl‐1β,glycoprotein nonmetastatic B(Gpnmb), andHsp90aa[172]. Simultaneously, microglia and other glial cells have been involved in PD. Reactive astrocytes overexpressCd44under the influence of upstream unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway induced by microglia [185]. The enhancement of cytokine release by both may promote higher expression of S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B) in oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, S100B has been found to be associated with neurodegeneration [186]. In PD, researchers have discovered that ablation of S100B protects against MPTP‐induced toxicity by preventing a combination of receptor for advanced glycation endproducts in microglia to reduce TNF‐α [187]. Oligodendrocytes have also been linked to the genetic risk factors associated with PD, with the PD geneLrrk2being highly expressed in oligodendrocytes [188]. Moreover, acquired immunity plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and the progression of PD. Despite the activation of glial cells, acquired immunity contributes significantly to immune system dysfunction in PD. First, scRNA‐seq and T cell antigen receptor (TCR) profiling discovered that CD4 cytotoxiclymphocytes (CTLs) expand remarkably in PD, originating from Th1 cells. Moreover, CD8+T cells demonstrate continuous progression from central memory to terminal effector T cells, which are also highly express genes of cellular chemokines, adhesion molecules, and their receptors (CCL4, CCL5, CX3CR1, CD99, and SELPLG) [189]. Peripheral B cell subtypes were also involved in the pathogenesis of PD. New insights from scRNA‐seq and B cell receptor sequencing indicate while the overall level of B cells in PD patients remains unchanged or may even decrease [190], the structure of the B‐cell subsets undergoes significant alterations. Among them, naïve B cells were significantly reduced, while a subset of unswitched memory B cells was the most significantly increased. Multiple B cell activation‐related genes such asFcrl5,Egr1, andCd86were highly expressed, which may be involved in the production of infiltrative antibodies and damage DaNs by humoral immunity in PD. Additionally, a significant clonal expanded memory B cell population upregulated major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) genes (HLA‐drb5,HLA‐dqa2, andHLA‐dpb1) and transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP‐1), revealing the activation of B cells and enhancement of antigen presentation capacity of B cells. Finally, the study identified preferential V and J gene fragments of B‐cell receptors in patients with PD as evidence of PD convergent selection. As central mediators, border‐associated macrophages (BAMs) are correlated with peripheral immune systems. Activated by α‐syn, BAMs transition into a “disease‐activated” state (DaBAMs). In this state, they express high levels of genes associated with T cell recruitment (Ccl5andCcl10), antigen processing and presentation (H2‐Aa,Cd74, andCd274), and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (Mmp14). Moreover, they are responsible for the recruitment and restimulation of CD4+T cell antigen, which is essential for α‐syn‐mediated neuroinflammation [191]. Notably, the loss of CD4+T cells is neuroprotective [192]. Consequently, the peripheral and tissue‐resident immune systems are vital in understanding the pathogenesis of PD. The interaction between peripheral and tissue‐resident immune systems may be a novel insight to better understand functions of immune system in PD pathology (Figure4).

Mechanism of α‐syn and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease revealed by Single‐cell and spatial multiomics. PD is commonly characterized by a loss of DaNs in the SN and the presence of α‐syn Lewy pathology. Glial cells and immune cells are found express specific transcriptional programs and pathways associated with PD. Microglia are activated by UPR pathway and activation is probably regulated by NFE2L2 and RUNX1 in MPTP model. Activated microglia highly express IL‐1β, GPNMB, and HSP90AA1 leading to proinflammation in IPD. S100B‐high oligodendrocyte overexpress S100B that mediate RAGE/TNF‐α pathway, causing neuronal loss. PERK–eIF2α signaling turns astrocyte into UPR‐reactivity state, which reduces production of neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix components thus leading to synapse loss of DaNs. α‐expression leads to a damage‐associated activation state of BAMs, which express genes for T cell recruitment, antigen processing and presentation. CD4+CTLs remarkably expand and highly express cytotoxic genes, while CD8+T cell undergo a continuous transition from central memory to terminal effector T cells with cytotoxicity.

As an aggressive brain tumor, GBM is considered a persistent challenge in contemporary oncology. Although patients with GBM can receive intensive treatments such as temozolomide chemotherapy,  surgical resection, and radiotherapy [193], GBM inevitably recurs. This poor prognosis is highly associated with the heterogeneity of GBM cells, tumor microenvironment (TME), immune system dysfunction, and genetics. Single‐cell and spatial multiomics offers an opportunity to characterize these cells precisely at a single resolution.

GBMs generally contain at least three different subtypes of typical cells. Every subpopulation varies significantly in their relative frequency in individual tumors. Most GBMs are primarily characterized by one particular subtype. A study combined scRNA‐seq of 20 adult and eight pediatric GBM cases [194], scRNA‐seq and lineage tracing of GBM models, and analysis of 401 TCGA bulk specimens, identifying four main subtypes: neural progenitor‐like (NPC‐like), oligodendrocyte‐progenitor‐like (OPC‐like), astrocyte‐like (AC‐like), and mesenchymal‐like (MES‐like). On the basis of the above research, researchers link high epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification to tumors rich in AC‐like cells, platelet‐derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) amplification to those with abundant OPC‐like cells, and cyclin‐dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplification to tumors with a predominance of NPC‐like cells. Tumors with significant MES‐like cells were characterized by changes of neurofibromin 1 (NF1), infiltration by immune cells, and hypoxia [195]. Similarly, another research elucidated the spatial architecture of GBM and analyzed the spatially resolved transcriptional heterogeneity [196]. By deconvoluting cellular composition, researchers identified five spatially distinct transcriptional programs: The “radial glia” and “reactive‐immune” programs, associated with radial‐glia and inflammation‐related genes, respectively; “development” and “spatial OPC” programs, coinciding with “developmental” signature and NPC‐ and OPC‐like tumor‐cell subgroups; and “reactive‐hypoxia” correlated with hypoxia‐response and glycolytic genes.

Interestingly, glioma stem cells (GSCs) can be designated as any one of these four subtypes. Research indicates that implanting xenografts enriched with cells in specific states into mice results in tumors that preserve the initial cellular ratios of those states. This finding suggests that these states possess self‐replication and differentiation capacities [31]. Another study associated these cellular states with established GSC markers. Marker expression levels were found to be highest forEgfrin AC‐like cells,Cd133in OPC‐like cells,Cd24in NPC‐like cells, andCd44in MES‐like cells, indicating the importance of these markers in distinguishing GSC subtypes [197]. Similar results were concluded by Bhaduri et al. [198], which identified a population of outer radial glia (oRG) cells in GBM resembling those found in normal cortical development, characterized by mitotic somal translocation or “jump‐and‐divide.” Concurrently, transcriptionally diverse cell clusters with RG and developmental gene expression are identified in adult human GBMs, exhibiting unique mitotic behaviors of normal glia cells. These clusters are alternative in quiescent and cycling states, suggesting that radial glia cells may represent the cells of origin or the CSCs at the top of the GBM cell hierarchy [199].

To gain a deeper comprehension of the association between the cerebral cancer cells and the corresponding stages of neural development, a study mapped the developmental stages of the mouse cerebrum from embryonic day 12.5 to postnatal day 365 [200]. This study was conducted using single‐cell transcriptomics on over 100, 000 cells, and this atlas was compared with single‐cell data from over 100 glial tumors. The results revealed that tumor cells exhibit expression patterns intersecting with the temporally constrained embryonic radial glial precursors and their immediate descendant lineages.

In addition to cellular heterogeneity, GBM cells exhibit another critical characteristic: state plasticity. GBM cells are able to switch between different cell states; however, each GBM typically has a high abundance of one or two of the four cell states, which is significantly influenced by the genetic factors [194]. However, the molecular factors that characterize GSCs in their native state are still not well understood. Yes‐associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ‐binding motif (YAP/TAZ) coactivators were identified to regulate cell states by reconstructing the regulatory networks of GSCs [201]. YAP/TAZ are essential for establishing GSC properties in primary cells downstream of multiple oncogenic lesions, and for tumor initiation and maintenance in vivo across various mouse and human GBM models. Therefore, their inhibition irreversibly locks differentiated GBM cells into a nontumorigenic state. Additionally, a high degree of plasticity is responsible for the failure of precision therapies that induce recurrent GBM. Recent studies have revealed that recurrent GBMs feature a shift to a mesenchymal phenotype. Researchers used scRNA‐seq and RNA velocity analyses and identified that incubating patient‐derived GSCs with recombinant chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) induces significant transitions of cells toward clusters with mesenchymal transcriptomic profiles. The CHI3L1‐CD44 interaction at the GSC surface activates pAKT and p‐β‐catenin signaling pathways and induces CD44 expression in a promesenchymal feed‐forward loop, thereby promoting mesenchymal transition. Besides, ATAC‐seq revealed that CHI3L1 increases the accessibility of promoters containing Myc‐associated zinc (MAZ) finger protein transcription factor footprint. MAZ inhibition downregulated a set of genes highly expressed in cellular clusters and exhibited significant cell state transitions following CHI3L1 treatment. MAZ deficiency mitigated the CHI3L1‐induced increase of GSC self‐renewal [202]. Another study identified that the mesenchymal state is mediated by AP‐1 [203]. During IR treatment, AP‐1 positively regulates the MES hallmarks of inflammation, invasiveness, and IR resistance by cis‐regulatory enhancers. Moreover, the AP‐1 transcription factors, including JUN, JUNB, and JUND, are necessary for the transcriptional activity of fos‐related antigen 1 (FRA‐1) through heterodimerization. As the downstream of the NF1–MAPK–FOS like 1 (FOSL1) signaling pathway, FOSL1/FRA‐1 directly regulates the expression of MES genes by binding to their promoters, includingCd44,Plau,Tnc, andItga5[204]. Loss or mutation of the NF1 copy number increases RAS/MAPK activity, thereby modulating FOSL1 expression, which is critical in regulating MES GBM (Figure5A).

Single‐cell and spatial multiomics reveal cellular changes and mechanisms of glioblastoma. (A) Plasticity, GBM cells can be assigned as NPC‐, OPC‐, AC‐, and MES‐like states, and a single tumor cell potentially generates all four states, among which ChI3L1 and AP1 drive GSCs toward a mesenchymal expression profile. (B) Hypoxia, ST found hypoxia forces the adoption of metabolic programs of growing GBM cells from PPP toward glycolysis, subsequently leading to migration to normoxic regions, and hypoxia response and migration signatures show inversely directed spatial trajectories. (C) Immunosuppression, GPNMB‐high macrophage can ineffectively retain T cells from activating by DCs. Macrophages express a mesenchymal program, inducing a MES‐like state of GBM cells, which also facilitate a transition of macrophages into the MP‐MES state. Furthermore, macrophages enforce glioma immune evasion. However, CD169‐high macrophages promote antitumor immunity against GBM via increasing accumulation of T cells and NK cells. (D) Epigenetics, GSCs reversibly transition to persistent state with drug resistance, which upregulate developmental programs dependent on H3K27 demethylases KDM6A/B and Notch signaling. Meanwhile, copy number of IRS1 or IRS2 are amplified, and activate insulin and AKT signaling programs, which lead to dasatinib resistance of GSCs. GSCs exhibit PRC2 target hypomethylation. PRC2 catalyze H3K27me3 deposition to repress lineage‐specific developmental genes in GSCs for stemness maintenance.

Brain tumors exhibit transcriptional adaptations similar to healthy brain tissue, with the local microenvironment significantly influencing tumorigenesis, including cellular communications and metabolism. These are crucial to the dynamic adaptation of brain cancers, facilitating growth, infiltration, and therapy resistance [204]. Hypoxia leads to the forced metabolic deterioration that drives transcriptional adaptation and genomic instability, including altered expression of DNA‐damage‐response and ‐repair genes [205,206]. This leads to the inhibition of recombination‐mediated repair of DNA double‐strand breaks, increased mutation rates, and copy number alterations (CNAs) [207]. Hypoxia also induced hypermethylation in cell lines with unmethylated O‐6‐methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase promoters and shifted metabolism from the pentose phosphate pathway to glycolysis [208], which facilitated tumor cell migration to normoxic areas [209]. Ravi et al. [210] investigated the spatial correlation between metabolic changes and specific CNAs using MALDI Fourier‐transform ion cyclotron resonance imaging mass spectrometry and scRNA‐seq. They identified three key metabolic subgroups: the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and amino sugar metabolism, and phosphoadenylate metabolism. Hypoxic regions, particularly hypoxia‐core areas, exhibited significant chromosomal changes, including losses of 15p and 14q and gains in chromosome 7, potentially due to subclonal selection. Additionally, hypoxia response and migration signatures were found to have opposed spatial trajectories, indicating that many hypoxia‐affected cells undergo apoptosis, contributing to the necrosis characteristic of GBM (Figure5B).

Cellular interactions between tumor cells and the immune system have increasingly been focused. Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential for promoting tumor progression and including immunosuppression in GBM [211]. The authors identified mesenchymal GBM subtypes expressed higher T cells and myeloid cell markers by Bulk‐seq analyses of TCGA datasets and revealed a strong correlation between macrophages and T cells [212]. They disclosed thatGpnmb‐high macrophage subpopulations could ineffectively retain T cells from activating DCs by competing with DCs. Therefore, targeting theGpnmb‐high macrophage subset may benefit in controlling GBM plasticity and facilitate T cell‐based immunotherapy. Wang et al. [213] found that patients with macrophage enrichment exhibited significantly worse survival, and the chemotaxis of macrophages was promoted by mesenchymal–epidermal transition (MET) factor overexpression. Meanwhile, MET induced upregulation of programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression by signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). It is believed that PD‐L1 blockade activates T cells and TAMs, and tumor cells frequently promote their escape from the immune system by upregulating the ligand for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) and PD‐L1. Additionally, neoadjuvant PD‐1 blockade was found to activate T cells and cDC1, inducing the production of chemotactic and cytolytic factors and the generation of exhausted T cell progenitors [214]. This therapy also systemically activated and expanded T cell clones in the periphery. However, macrophages and monocytes still encompassed the majority of infiltrating immune cells, leading to increased T cell trafficking and immunosuppressive activity. Moreover, macrophages induced proneural‐to‐mesenchymal transition (PMT) [212], which is considered a main cause of radioresistance and tumor recurrence during the malignant progression of GBM [215]. This effect of transition is mediated by macrophage‐derived oncostatin M (OSM), which interacts with its receptors (OSMR or LIFR) in complex with glycoprotein 130 (GP130) and activates STAT3 [216]. A similar relationship was found between intratumoral neutrophils and PMT [217]. Neutrophil‐derived TNF‐α directly drives mesenchymal transition in platelet‐derived growth factor B‐driven primary GBM cells [218]. Interestingly, research validated that cytotoxic T‐cells were enriched in TCGA‐MES tumors. T‐cell‐mediated killing of GBMs might be more efficient against MES‐like states. Another study investigated that theCd169+macrophages derived from blood monocytes produce proinflammatory chemokines and promote accumulation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, contributing to antitumor immunity against GBM [219]. Furthermore, a robust correlation was found between NK‐cell‐derived interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) and the accumulation ofCd169+macrophages, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic target. The emergence ofCd169+macrophages provides novel insights into TAMs (Figure5C).

Genetic drivers shape the distribution of glioma cell states, affecting the quantity and composition of GBM cells. These drivers also modulate the immune microenvironment, dictating the composition of microenvironmental myeloid cells [220]. Notably, epigenetic mechanisms are crucial for maintaining GSC plasticity and are linked to GBM drug resistance. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has been reported to directly correlate with DNA methylation [221]. PRC2 targeted hypomethylation marks GSCs, sustaining their stemness and reactivation potential [222]. In GBM drug resistance, amplifications of IRS2 and IRS1 confer resistance to dasatinib in PDGFRA‐amplified GSCs, which can reversibly transition to a slow‐cycling state dependent on Notch signaling [217]. These persistent GSCs upregulate H3K27 demethylases KDM6A/B, contributing to H3K27me3 alterations in dasatinib‐treated GSCs [30]. Therefore, the interaction between epigenetics and genetics is crucial for maintaining GBM plasticity and drug resistance along with regulating the distribution of glioma cell states (Figure5D).

Although ASD is typically considered in the context of childhood, they may represent lifelong conditions. A fundamental shared characteristic of ASD is the disruption of synaptic circuit formation and balance [223]. For genetically complex disorders like ASD, it remains unclear how diverse genetic risk factors converge on shared transcriptional alterations. Based on established evidence linking contactin‐associated protein‐like 2 (Cntnap2) to ASD [224,225], a study integrated quantitative proteometabolomic data from Cntnap2 KO mice with multiomics data from ASD patients and forebrain organoids, revealing Cntnap2‐dependent molecular networks in ASD [226]. ScRNA‐seq analysis identified Ex as the major cell type in Cntnap2‐dependent ASD. Ex‐specific DEGs were significantly enriched in axonal structure, synaptic vesicle function, and oxidative phosphorylation. Compared with controls, Cntnap2 KO mice exhibited enhanced lipid metabolism (upregulation of ACAA2, ACADM), but dysregulation of glycolysis and the electron transport chain; downregulation of proteins about synaptic vesicle trafficking, including vesicle recycling, docking, and exocytosis (VAMP2, RAB3A, SNAP25); disruption of cytoskeletal regulatory pathways (RAC/CDC42/PAK, MAPK/ERK), evidenced by downregulation of key molecules like PAK3 and GAP43. Collectively, these findings demonstrate thatCntnap2deficiency drives ASD phenotypes by impairing mitochondrial function, synaptic vesicle transport, and axonal development within Ex. Hypoxic conditions are considered an important pathological mechanism in ASD, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF1A) is a key participant in this mechanism [227]. Integrated module analysis and machine learning identified four HIF1A‐associated ASD hub genes:Cdkn1a,Ets2,Lyn, andSlc16a3[228]. Furthermore, maternal immune activation during pregnancy is also a significant risk factor for ASD, which is linked to the activation of IL‐6 in microglia [229]. Examination of a scRNA‐seq dataset from ASD patients revealed significant enrichment of these hub genes specifically in reactive microglia and was subsequently validated in animal models [228]. Further in vitro investigations elucidated the potential regulatory impact of IL‐6 on the expression of hub genes through the HIF1A pathway in microglia, specifically, the IL‐6/JUN/HIF1A axis regulates the expression ofCdkn1a,Lyn, andSlc16a3in microglia, thus participating neuroinflammation in ASD.

Recent studies have explored the differential involvement of lamina‐specific and cell type‐specific pathways in ASD. In the frontal cortex of ASD patients, significant glial cell activation is evident, characterized by a marked increase in the proportion of activated microglia and astrocytes [230]. Within microglia, phagocytosis‐related genes (Tlr2,Cd68) are upregulated. Astrocytes exhibit upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (Tgf‐β1). ST analysis reveals that glial activation is concentrated in superficial cortical laminae (Layer 2 and 3, L23), which is colocalized with transcriptomic dysregulation in Ex. Specifically, within the L23 Ex subtype, synaptic genes (Neto2,Grm3) are significantly downregulated, while genes associated with inflammatory pathways (Tgf‐β2,Spp1) are upregulated. Gene regulatory network analysis identifies Cux1 as a core transcription factor regulating L23 Ex and its target genes are enriched for ASD risk genes. Runx1 and Jund are identified as drivers of the microglial inflammatory response, considering the activity of Runx1 and Jund is induced by TGF‐β signals [231,232], TGF‐β signaling may mediate neuron‐glia crosstalk, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response. Similarly, through integrated analysis of single‐nucleus multiomics data, genome‐wide association studies (GWAS), and ST (MERFISH), ASD‐risk genes are found to be significantly enriched in L6 intratelencephalic Ex within the prefrontal cortex and primary visual cortex‐specific L4 intratelencephalic Ex during the second trimester [233].

ALS is a severe motor neuron disease driven by the interplay of central and peripheral immunity. Typical pathological feature of ALS is nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic accumulation of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP‐43) [234]. As the primary vulnerable cell type in ALS, motor neurons have been found to be enriched with multiple risk genes. For instance, Thy1high extratelencephalic neurons (ETNs) exhibit elevated expression of ALS risk genes in both ALS patients and healthy individuals [235]. ST data confirm that ETNs are predominantly localized to L5 motor cortex (MCX). Beyond risk gene enrichment, ETNs significantly upregulate stress‐response genes, concurrently, oligodendrocytes downregulate myelination‐associated genes (Cnp,Mbp), while microglia upregulate proinflammatory genes (Trem2,Apoe), and these dysregulations are mechanistically linked to neuronal apoptosis, suggesting the selective vulnerability of ETNs arises not only from their intrinsic properties but also from a degenerative cascade triggered by their stressed state. Another study identified a distinct subpopulation of upper motor neurons (Vat1l⁺ neurons), which was also localized to L5 primary MCX and enriched with ALS risk genes [236]. Additionally, researchers observed downregulation of tight junction proteins (CLDN5, PECAM1) and HLA‐E in MCX endothelial cells. As a key regulatory factor of NK cell, HLA‐E has previously been proven to be capable of inhibiting NK‐mediated cell lysis [237]. These findings suggest that loss of HLA‐E expression in the brain endothelium may represent a mechanistic pathway for NK‐mediated BBB disruption. Interestingly, four microglial subpopulations exhibiting a DAM‐like phenotype were identified in the developing spinal cord of ALS patients [238]. GO analysis revealed their functional implication in key biological processes, including TYROBP causal network in microglia, responding to unfolded proteins, positively regulating cell death, responding to toxic substances, responding to axon injury, participating in neuron apoptotic processes, and activating T cells, provide valuable insights into the microglial profiles underlying ALS pathogenesis.

The role of peripheral blood immune cells in neuroinflammation during ALS remains controversial. A scRNA‐seq study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ALS patients highlighted the involvement of T helper 17 cells (Th17), effector CD8 T cells, and CD16highCD56lowmature NK cells [239]. The results showed that in rapidly progressing ALS patients, the ratio of Th17 cells (proinflammatory) to Treg cells (anti‐inflammatory) was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease progression rate; the ratio of effector CD8 T cells to naïve CD8 T cells were higher in the rapid progression group, with the ratio positively correlated with progression speed and the proportion of CD16highCD56lowmature NK cells was higher in the rapid progression group. Combining serum proteomics through a proximity extension assay, researchers identified serum inflammatory proteins positively correlated with the frequency of the above cells, such as IL‐17A–Th17 and CD94‐effector CD8 T cells. A recent study identified a pathogenic CD56dimFceR1G+NK (NK_2) subset expanded in ALS patients, characterized by cytotoxic gene signatures (Gzmb,Nkg7) and activation of immune‐response pathways [240]. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed a unique ALS‐specific interaction network centered on HLA‐E ligands (expressed by CD8+memory T cells) binding CD94:NKG2C receptors on NK_2 cells, driving proinflammatory signaling. This ligand–receptor axis promotes NK cytolytic activity and lymphocyte proliferation, suggesting peripheral immune hyperactivation. Notably, the proportion of CD56bright NK cells correlated strongly with plasma neurofilament light levels, which may implicate CD56brightNK subsets in neuronal injury possibly via CNS migration. These findings highlight dynamic NK‐T cell crosstalk through specific molecular hubs, positioning peripheral NK subsets as key mediators of neuroinflammation and biomarkers of disease progression in ALS.

Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is the most common cause of drug‐resistant focal epilepsy [241]. Among them, the difference between FCD type 2 (FCD II) lesions and other FCDS lies in abnormal cortical stratification, dysmorphic neurons (DNs), and balloon cells (BCs) [242], which is driven by the developmental somatic activating mutations in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway genes [243]. ST in FCD IIb revealed distinct molecular signatures within DNs and BCs microenvironments [244]. Evidenced by p62 accumulation, DNs region exhibited mTOR pathway hyperactivation, impaired autophagy, and ubiquitin–proteasome dysregulation, and enrichment of genes regulating membrane potential (Gabrd,Ywhah,Snap25), suggesting intrinsic hyperexcitability. BCs region showed pronounced neuroinflammation and complement cascade activation (C3,Clu,Serpina3), indicating BCs function as inflammatory hubs. Shared dysregulation of developmental growth pathways occurred in both regions. Critically, BCs‐driven complement signaling (C3/CLU) potentially modulates microglial activation and astrocyte reactivity. The molecular characteristics of DNs and BCs have also been revealed recently. In FCD IIb, somatic mTOR pathway mutations exist in various cell types [245]. For example, DNs affected by the mutations express genes about neurofilament protein (Nefm) and mitochondrial biomass (Vdac1), whose molecular characteristics are similar to glutaminergic neurons; The BCs affected by mutations express cellular senescence‐related genes (Igfbp7), whose molecular characteristics are similar to astrocytes. Swollen and fragmented mitochondria in DNs can be observed through electron microscope, combined with the upregulation of mitochondrial gene (Vdac1) expression and the increase of VDAC1 protein level, it suggests that the excessive activation of mTOR leads to mitochondrial metabolic dysregulation. These spatial mappings identify mTOR‐driven proteomic and mitochondrial homeostasis dysregulation in DNs and BCs as convergent pathways promoting epilepsy in FCD IIb.

As one of the most common types of epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by significant pathological changes in the hippocampus, typically manifested as neuronal loss, gliosis, and increased neural fiber density, collectively termed hippocampal sclerosis [246]. By integrating the results of three sequencing methods (scRNA‐seq, snRNA‐seq, and Xenium), researchers found that in the hippocampus of TLE mice, the loss of inhibitory neurons was the most severe [247]. In terms of transcriptomic alterations, pathways related to gliosis, innate immune response, cytokine response, and phagocytosis are upregulated, marked by the consistent upregulation ofSpp1,Trem2, andCd68, Xenium analysis showed diffuse overexpression ofSpp1in the damaged hippocampus, indicating significant inflammation. In neurons, the neurotrophin pathway was significantly upregulated, its upstream mediatorBdnfis mainly expressed in Ex, with its receptors distributed between inhibitory neurons and Ex. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed the most increased interaction between Ex and microglia in the hippocampus, suggesting that excessive neuronal interactions leading to hypersynchronization may drive glial inflammation and hippocampal sclerosis. Integrated scRNA‐seq and ST in drug‐resistant epilepsy (DRE) reveal a transcriptionally distinct cortical pyramidal neuron subcluster (PY2) characterized by a senescent molecular signature [248]. PY2 highly expresses senescence‐related genes (p21,Nfkbia,Ccl2). Spatial validation via expansion‐assisted iterative FISH [249] confirmed enlarged soma size and colocalization of senescence markers in histopathological neurons from FCD and temporal TLE tissues. This senescence phenotype is driven by chronic seizure activity, as demonstrated in Pten−/−mouse models, where mTOR‐dependent inflammatory cascades trigger neuronal cell‐cycle arrest and secretory phenotype activation. Neuro‐glial crosstalk is implicated through PY2‐derived chemokines, CCL2, which recruit microglia and amplify neuroinflammation via nuclear factor kappa‐B signaling. Crucially, mTOR inhibition through rapamycin downregulate senescence markers, highlighting cellular senescence as a mechanistic link between neuronal hyperexcitability and immune dysregulation in DRE.

Most persistent complex diseases have multicellular etiologies. Understanding the perspective of individual cells is crucial for improving our ability to identify the most effective therapeutic targets at the cellular or molecular level. Single‐cell and spatial multiomics allows researchers to identify interactions between different cells in various regions, including signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and cell‐to‐cell communication. This innovative approach reveals genes with upregulated expression levels in specific cells or subcellular structures within the area of interest, uncovering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In the following sections, our study will provide an extensive review of the clinical application of single‐cell and spatial multiomics in discovering new therapeutic targets and their corresponding treatment strategies for CNS diseases (Table2).

The neurovascular damage following IS is primarily caused by a series of inflammatory responses triggered by damage‐associated molecular patterns and reactive oxygen species released from ischemic and hypoxic brain tissues [288]. Moreover, damage or injury to neurons in the brain during adulthood reduces their renewal and regeneration abilities. Therefore, it is pivotal to recognize that the neuroprotection concept in treating IS has shifted from reducing neuronal cell death to activating endogenous neuroprotection [289]. Based on this, the proper termination of neuroinflammation and the activation of endogenous molecules have garnered significant research interest.

Recently,leukocyte immunoglobulin‐like receptor B4(Lilrb4) in microglia has been found to play a crucial role in the immune response following IS by modulating CD8+T cell infiltration and activation [250]. ST analysis revealed increased expression ofLilrb4in the ischemic hemisphere. Furthermore, scRNA‐seq identified a microglial cluster3, which is an ischemia‐associated microglial subcluster with elevatedLilrb4expression in the ischemic brain. Microglial overexpression ofLilrb4was found to prevent ischemia‐induced brain damage. Furthermore, T‐cell migration assays demonstrated thatLilrb4‐KD microglia promoted CD8+T‐cell recruitment and activation in vitro. This effect was mitigated by CCL2 inhibition and recombinant arginase‐1 addition. BAMs, located at the interface between the brain and the periphery, have recently been reported participating in various brain pathologies, however, their role and mechanisms in stroke remain poorly understood. Analysis of two scRNA‐seq datasets revealed comprehensive changes in BAMs following stroke [251]. For instance, under hypoxic conditions, BAMs activated the TNF pathway, and the activity of the transcription factorStat3in BAMs was significantly upregulated, suggesting thatStat3inhibition might be a potential strategy for treating BAM‐induced neuroinflammation. Depletion of BAMs using liposomes containing clodronate resulted in a significant reduction in cerebral infarct volume in mice, along with decreased expression levels of TNF and F4/80, indicating that BAM depletion can mitigate poststroke inflammatory responses, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke treatment. Frankincense and myrrh are two natural substances used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating cerebrovascular diseases [290], and their key components, 11‐keto‐β‐boswellic acid (KBA) and Z‐guggulsterone (Z‐GS), are the active ingredients. Single‐cell transcriptomics has revealed the synergistic mechanism of KBA and Z‐GS on IS [252]. The KBA–Z‐GS treatment can regulate the inflammatory response in microglia, withSlc1a2andTimp1being the core fate transition genes regulated by KBA–Z‐GS. Additionally, researchers have identifiedSpp1as the target gene for the synergistic protection of MCAO by KBA–Z‐GS. KBA–Z‐GS treatment promotedSpp1expression in microglia and astrocytes, confirmingSpp1as the hub target of KBA and Z‐GS. FTY720 is a United Sates Food and Drug Administration‐approved anti‐inflammatory drug that has exhibited potential neuroprotective properties in ischemic brain tissue [291]. A recent study introduced a nanodrug coated in neutrophil membranes that can migrate to ischemic brain tissue and release FTY720 in situ under increased ROS levels [253]. This nanodrug can deliver 15.2 times more FTY720 to the ischemic brain and significantly reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity and infection compared with intravenous free drug administration. Furthermore, scRNA‐seq analysis found that the nanodrug reprograms microglia to an anti‐inflammatory phenotype by regulating CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta‐mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) chemokine secretion, thereby alleviating poststroke inflammation.

Forkhead box p3 (FOXP3), the master immune repressive transcription factor of Treg cell, was reported to promote macrophage phagocytosis by enhancing cargo metabolism, thereby strengthening efferocytosis to terminate cell‐death‐induced neural inflammation [254,292]. FOXP3 expression was regulated by macroautophagic/autophagic protein degradation in resting macrophages. The initiation of LC3‐associated phagocytosis after acute IS competitively occupied the autophagic machinery, thereby allowing FOXP3 activation and FOXP3+macrophages exhibiting superactive phagocytic capacity. However, immune cell infiltration can cause brain microvascular endothelium dysfunction, increase BBB permeability, and develop a driving force for vasogenic (transvascular) edema, which is detrimental to recovery [293]. For instance, integrated with scRNA‐seq, macrophages have been reported to release thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) via exosomes [255], which promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) by binding to OTU deubiquitinase 5 (OTUD5), thereby increasing endothelial cells’ susceptibility to ferroptosis and exacerbating cerebral I/R injury. Targeting this mechanism, salvianolic acid B can inhibit the interaction between THBS1 and OTUD5, reducing the ubiquitination and degradation of GPX4, thereby alleviating endothelial cell ferroptosis and BBB disruption. PD‐1 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint, and monocytes upregulate PD‐1 after acute cerebrovascular injury. A recent study has found that intraperitoneal injection of soluble PD‐L1 (sPD‐L1) can significantly reduce brain edema and improve overall survival rates [256]. However, this reduction is not observed in PD‐1 knockout animals, confirming that PD‐1+monocytes are the therapeutic target of sPD‐L1. ScRNA‐seq revealed that sPD‐L1 treatment induced monocytes matured into a nonclassical LY6Clo, CD43hi, PD‐L1+phenotype, suggesting the potential of using sPD‐L1 to activate PD‐1 on peripheral monocytes to limit secondary inflammatory damage.

Endogenous molecules in the brain are anticipated to promote the survival and repair of neurons surrounding the injured site and accelerate stroke recovery. Phospholipase a2 group IIE (PLA2G2E) is considered one of the therapeutic targets for IS for metabolizing phosphatidylserine significantly exposed on the dead cell surface in necrotic brain tissues [294]. Nakamuraet al.discovered that PLA2G2E secreted by neurons surrounding the infarct induced neuronal peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) expression by generating dihomo‐γ‐linolenic acid (DGLA) [257]. Moreover, AI4 is a global transcriptional regulator in neurons surrounding the infarct [295,296]. ScRNA‐seq and epigenetic analyses indicated that neuronal PADI4 exhibited the potential to activate genes associated with the recovery process following IS through histone citrullination. Researchers found that among various DGLA metabolites, 15‐hydroxy‐eicosatrienoic acid induced PADI4 in peri‐infarct‐surviving neurons enhances functional recovery after IS. Furthermore, another study identified a prominent Treg cell cluster among brain‐infiltrating immune cells during the chronic phase after IS in mice [297]. Treg cell‐derived OPN was found to enhance microglial reparative activity through integrin receptors, thereby promoting oligodendrogenesis and WM regeneration. Increasing the number of Treg cells by administering IL‐2:IL‐2 antibody complexes significantly improved WM integrity and long‐term functional recovery after IS. As a molecule closely related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling [298], X‐box binding protein 1 (XBP1) has been found to be a key regulator of a novel endothelial cell subtype associated with angiogenesis (termed healing EC) post IS [258]. Analysis of two brain scRNA‐seq datasets of MCAO mice indicated that healing EC highly expressed pan‐endothelial cell markers. The proangiogenesis genes consisted of high stemness and could differentiate into other endothelial cell subtypes. Additionally, healing EC may regulate angiogenesis by secreting signaling molecules (such as XBP1). Comparative imaging based on synchrotron radiation propagation further demonstrated that XBP1 promoted angiogenesis and restored normal vascular conformation, particularly in the striatum and prefrontal cortex under MCAO condition. A recent study reported two distinct pericyte subtypes (Ng2+andTbx18+), possessing different potentials following IS [259]. Besides,Ng2+pericytes exhibit superior neural reprogramming potential in generating new neurons, whileTbx18+pericytes display dominant multipotency after IS, capable of producing endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and microglia. In neural reprogramming culture models ofNg2+pericytes from mice and humans, researchers discovered the role of the energy sensor adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) in modulating the reprogramming/differentiation process. AMPK modulators can regulate the phosphorylation status of Ser 436 on cAMP‐response element binding protein (CREB)‐binding protein, coordinate the acetylation shift between SOX2 and histone H2B, and regulate the nuclear‐cytoplasmic shift of SOX2 during the reprogramming/differentiation process of microsphere cells. This helps promote the conversion of pericytes into functional neurons after IS.

Post SAH, the meningeal lymphatic system within the dura mater transports large molecules from the brain parenchyma outward and conveys cerebrospinal fluid to the surrounding cervical lymph nodes, contributing to the clearance of pathological substances [299,300]. Previous studies have demonstrated that meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) played a key role in the removal of intracranial waste [301,302]. However, there is limited literature about the cellular structure and potential gene regulatory characteristics of mLVs post SAH. Recently, changes in the cellular, molecular, and spatial patterns of mLVs post‐SAH were revealed with stLearn [260,303], and the THBS1–CD47 L‐R pair was predicted to promote mLVs injury. In vivo experiments demonstrated the detrimental effects of THBS1 and CD47 following SAH. GSEA indicated that the apoptosis pathway was significantly activated 24 h postinjury, with experimental results confirming that the THBS1–CD47 L‐R promotes mLVs apoptosis through the STAT3/Bcl‐2 signaling pathway. In addition, researchers revealed that the expression ofS100a6in the meninges significantly increased 24 h after injury, while the expression ofS100a6and THBS1 displayed a linear relationship. Prognostic analysis suggested that higher expression ofS100a6was related to worse prognosis, suggesting thatS100a6may be a novel biomarker for meningeal lymphatic injury.

Recently, results of cell‐to‐cell interaction analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis canonical pathway analysis based on ST and scRNA‐seq indicated that insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1)–IGF1 receptor ligand receptor pair may mediate the interaction of microglia with astrocytes [261]. Specifically, IGF1 derived from microglia promotes astrocyte scar formation through the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway in the early stages of ICH. This process helps establish a favorable microenvironment for remyelination and BBB repair, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of early ICH. Due to the ability to penetrate BBB, Celastrol, the primary active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicineTripterygium wilfordii[304,305,306], has been found to play a therapeutic role in CNS diseases [307,308]. In the secondary brain injury following ICH, with the employment of snRNA‐seq (10x Genomics), Celastrol was reported to influence cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cAMP‐activated exchange protein‐1 (EPAC‐1) signaling pathways [262,309], thereby improving mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons and exerting neuroprotective effects in mice after ICH. Damage or dysfunction within the CNS can lead to persistent chronic pain, with central poststroke pain (CPSP) being a typical manifestation. Thalamic hemorrhage, a specific form of cerebral hemorrhage, is particularly prone to triggering CPSP. Utilizing snRNA‐seq, researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the alterations in neuronal gene expression within a model of CPSP induced by ICH [263]. Through the analysis of DEGs between control and model groups and the construction of a miRNA–mRNA network,calcium voltage‐gated channel subunit alpha1 C(Cacna1c) has been predicted as a pivotal therapeutic target for CPSP.

Selective removal ofApoe4from cells can reduce the pathological burden associated with AD. For instance, in 2021, a study employed snRNA‐seq to investigate the cell‐specific role of APOE in neurodegeneration revealed that the removal of astrocyticApoe4reduced tau‐induced synaptic loss and microglial phagocytosis of synaptic components [264]. Moreover, the selective genetic removal of neuronalApoe4can ameliorate the progressive cellular and tissue changes that occur inApoe4‐driven tau pathology models [265]. snRNA‐seq revealed that the removal of neuronalApoe4significantly reduced the subpopulations of neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia associated with neurodegenerative diseases, which correlate with the severity of tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Notably, a current study has demonstrated that the depletion of microglia can alleviate the deposition of Aβ and p‐tau induced byApoe4neurons [266]. These findings underscore the significance of neuron–microglia interactions in the pathogenesis of AD.

Microglial receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells‐2 (TREM2) is essential for microglia to respond to neurodegeneration [310]. Combined with immunofluorescence technology, scRNA‐seq analysis determined that IL‐3, as a key medium of astrocyte–microglia communication, can reprogram microglia to improve AD pathology [267]. IL‐3 in the brain is primarily derived from astrocytes, and its receptor IL‐3Rα is located on microglia and regulated by TREM2. Notably, scRNA‐seq was used to assess the effectiveness of TREM2‐activated antibodies. A novel therapeutic candidate, termed antibody transport vehicle (ATV), was characterized as a high‐affinity human TREM2 antibody engineered with a monovalent transferrin receptor binding site in the Fc domain to enable active transport into the CNS [268]. Furthermore, scRNA‐seq and morphometry revealed that ATV:TREM2 shifts microglia to metabolically responsive states, which are distinct from those induced by amyloid pathology. Additionally, ATV:TREM2 promotes microglia proliferation through mTOR and PLCG2 and is biologically distinct from other innate immune stimuli. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the therapeutic candidate ATV:TREM2 increases microglial functions. Similarly, as a drug inducing passive Aβ immunization, lecanemab treatment has been reported to modulate specific responses in microglia [269]. Through the integration of scRNA‐seq and ST, up‐regulated expression of genes associated with Aβ clearance has been observed in microglia within the brains of lecanemab‐treated patients, such asTrem2, and the degree of microglial activation and the efficiency of Aβ clearance have been found to vary across different brain regions. A loss‐of‐function variant ofTrem2is associated with an increased risk of AD [311], suggesting that activating this innate immune receptor could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy. Patients with AD carrying theTrem2R47H variant exhibited defects in microglial transcriptional activation to a certain extent [312], while R47H mice exhibited an increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in the brain, and decreased expression of genes involved in autophagy, growth factor signaling, and neural connectivity. ST analysis of AD model mice combined with R47H demonstrated that the presence of this variant impeded microglia response to plaque early in the disease and exacerbated peripheral dystrophic neurites. Moreover, the R47H microglia‐induced transcriptional changes include the AKT signaling activation, which is among the TREM2 downstream pathways, and pharmacological inhibition of AKT is a potential therapeutic strategy [270]. In R47H heterozygous tauopathy mice, treatment with MK‐2206 eliminated tauopathy‐dependent microglial subclusters and rescued tauopathy‐induced synaptic loss by inhibiting AKT signaling.

Aβ around cerebral blood vessels is considered both a cause and a consequence of BBB damage, which ultimately serves as an early biomarker for cognitive dysfunction [313]. To reveal the molecular changes underlying BBB dysfunction in AD, snRNA‐seq analysis of 24 cases of AD and control brains was performed, focusing on vascular and astrocyte clusters as the main cell types of the BBB gliovascular unit [271]. The prediction of ligand–receptor interactions indicated an inverse relationship between pericytic SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) and astrocytic VEGFA. Whole‐brain correlation analysis between blood SMAD3 levels and cerebral Aβ deposition indicated an association between higher blood SMAD3 levels and less brain Aβ. Moreover, VEGFA downregulation may upregulate pericytic SMAD3, ultimately affecting the function of BBB, confirming in human iPSC and zebrafish model experiments.

SPP1, which was increased by perivascular macrophages in patients with AD, was reported to be essential for microglia activation for the phagocytosis of synapses [272]. ScRNA‐seq and computational ligand‐target predictions (NicheNet28) [314] analysis in microglia revealed that perivascular SPP1 induced microglial phagocytosis in the AD mice hippocampus, and loss of SPP1 expression prevented synaptic loss, suggesting a functional role of SPP1 in the crosstalk between perivascular cells and microglia in AD. To study neuronal maturation, cell type‐specific vulnerability or dysregulation in a more physiological in vivo context, iPSC‐derived neural precursor cells carrying the fAD‐associated APP V717I mutation and their isogenic controls were injected into the striatum and cortex of 2‐month‐old, immunocompromised mice, followed by histological and transcriptional analyses on grafted cells [273]. snRNA‐seq analysis identified significantly altered transcriptomic signatures in APP V717I iPSC‐derived neurons, including upregulation of the transmembrane protein leucine rich repeat and ig domain containing 2 (LINGO2). LINGO2 knockdown exerted beneficial effects on APP V717I neurons by affecting cellular signaling pathways, including the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)/MAPK signaling pathway, hence, rescuing neurite outgrowth defects and reversing transcriptional changes associated with synaptic dysfunction.

Adaptive immune cells are increasingly being utilized in the pathogenesis of AD [315,316]. Previous studies have revealed that higher numbers of T cells are observed in the brains of AD mice models [317,318]. To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the neuropathological environment of AD, Jorfi et al. [274] described a 3D model of the human neuroimmune axis, including stem cell‐derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia, and human peripheral immune cells. Using this model, the researchers found that the number of CD8+T cells was increased in patients with AD and AD‐like transgenic models. The coexistence of CD8+T cells and microglia exerted synergistic effects, which aggravated the neuronal and glial cell damage. ScRNA‐seq analysis revealed that T cell infiltration into AD cultures induced IFN‐γ and neuroinflammatory pathways in glial cells. The C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and its receptor CXCR3 are critical in this process. CXCL10 induces T cell chemotaxis by binding to CXCR3, a receptor expressed by CD8+T cells. Inhibiting CXCL10 binding to CXCR3 with anti‐CXCR3 neutralizing antibody (MAB160) attenuated CD8+T cell infiltration and neurodegeneration.

Transplantation of cells from fetal brain tissue or from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which can generate DaNs, is a critical treatment of PD. A recent study supports the use of stem‐cell‐based models at a single resolution to study human ventral midbrain (VM) development for disease modeling and therapeutics [319]. Researchers demonstrated that cell types derived from hPSCs were similar to those derived from fetal VM development without any aberrant cell types. However, the temporal appearance of different cell types corresponded to the order of progression observed in human fetal VM. Particularly, the molecular profile of DA neurons derived from hPSCs closely matched that of VM‐derived DA neurons. However, the heterogeneity of hPSC‐derived donor cells and the low yield of mDA neurons after transplantation hinder its broad clinical application. ScRNA‐seq characterizes the single‐cell molecular landscape of DaNs and non‐mDA cells during DaN differentiation, which holds promise as a therapeutic strategy by eliminating non‐mDA cells and facilitating the enrichment of DaNs.

Choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) are the main non‐DA cell type, and CD99 is a candidate surface marker for the purification of DA progenitors, which can be used to eliminate CPECs and improve the purity of DA progenitors via fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) isolation [24]. Moreover, as it is highly expressed in EN1+DA progenitors, leucine‐rich glioma‐inactivated 1 can partially induce cell fate transition toward DA identities. Calsyntenin 2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O are identified as surface markers of mDA progenitors, facilitating high enrichment of mDA neurons. mDA neurons are stably enriched in marker‐sorted grafts, while non‐DA populations are consistently depleted [275]. Another study disclosed important developmental factors for the differentiation of hESCs into mDA neurons [276]. ScRNA‐seq revealed high‐quality hESC‐derived cell types that included mDA neurons, resembling the human midbrain with their new protocol. Laminin‐511, along with dual activation of canonical and noncanonical wingless‐related integration site (WNT) pathways followed by GSK3β inhibition and fibroblast growth factor 8b, improved midbrain patterning. Additionally, activation of liver X receptors and inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signaling further enhanced neurogenesis and differentiation.

Typically, stem cells are differentiated and mature under traditional monolayer (2D) culture conditions. However, it may be inadequate for the maintenance of TH neurons. Some cells in 2D culture undergo incomplete differentiation or insufficient patterning toward a VM regional fate. ScRNA‐seq has identified the advantage of 3D organoid‐like cultures in generating and maintaining mature DA neurons [320]. Researchers performed extensive scRNA‐seq analysis to decode VM development in human embryos from onset to peak DA genesis. Consequently, they established a 3D organoid‐like culture system, which profiles functionally mature DA neurons in 3D cultures derived from the human fetal VM. Conversely, an adeno‐associated virus (AAV)‐based strategy carrying intein–split–dCas9 in combination with activators (AAV–dCAS), a novel intervention strategy beyond the restoration of dopamine level, may provide a substitute route for clinical therapies of PD [277]. Single‐cell transcriptome analysis confirmed that AAV–dCAS successfully reprogrammed striatal astrocytes into induced GABAergic neurons. These GABAergic neurons functionally integrate into striatal circuits, alleviating voluntary motor behavior aspect.

Recent research has shifted from cell replacement to multitargeted therapies like immune regulation and paracrine signaling [321,322]. Exploring immunomodulation in PD can help identify new therapeutic targets and strategies to mitigate or reverse neurodegenerative changes [323]. Persistent inflammatory responses of microglia and astrocytes significantly contribute to PD progression [324]. Intraspinal transplantation of hypoxia‐preconditioned olfactory mucosal mesenchymal stem cells (hOM–MSCs) improves neurologic function recovery and modulates neuroinflammation in PD patients. hOM–MSCs maintain microglia autophagy homeostasis and promote their transformation from M1 to M2 phenotype via TGF‐β1‐activated activin receptor‐like kinase (ALK)–phosphoinositide 3‐kinas (PI3K)–AKT signaling in microglia [278]. Additionally, a recent study used an E. coli MG1655 strain to produce melanin‐containing exosomes, reducing astrocytic synapse engulfment by activating the prosaposin (PSAP)–GPR37L1 pathway and protecting DaNs [279]. Moreover, scRNA‐seq data from PD patients shows that elevatedCthexpression correlates with neurotoxic astrocyte reactivity. Researchers found cystathionine γ‐lyase (CSE) induces astrocytes' neurotoxic transition via the CSE–YAP–forkhead box d3 (FOXD3) axis in PD, suggesting a potential therapeutic target [280]. Furthermore, Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway suppression shows clinical potential in inhibiting innate and acquired immune cell activation and infiltration. Interestingly, scRNA‐seq reveals reduced microglia cluster cell numbers under JAK/STAT suppression, with no transcriptional profile changes [281]. Collectively, these findings suggest that scRNA‐seq can uncover the potential of cell replacement and identify potential targets from immune regulation for PD treatment.

TAMs are essential in supporting tumor progression and inducing immunosuppression. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the infiltration of immunosuppressive TAMs likely resulted in GBM being unresponsive to immunotherapy [325,326]. These findings indicate TAM as a potential therapeutic target for GBM. The following section summarizes current TAM‐targeted therapeutic strategies in GBM.

The first strategy is to inhibit TAM infiltration by targeting the axes between their receptors and ligands. Using the slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2)‐trapping protein Robo1Fc effectively inhibits macrophage infiltration and tumor growth in GBM mouse models, significantly improving the antitumor effects by its combination with anti‐PD‐1 and anti‐4‐1BB therapies [282]. Mechanistically, SLIT2 promotes microglia/macrophage chemotaxis and tumor‐supportive polarization via roundabout guidance receptor 1/2 (ROBO1/2)‐mediated PI3Kγ activation in macrophages. Consequently, inhibiting PI3Kγ prevents TAM accumulation in the GBM TME and elevates the antitumor efficacy of temozolomide [283]. Moreover, the properties of driving GBM immunosuppression of clock circadian regulator (CLOCK) have been reported in recent studies [284,285]. CLOCK and its heterodimeric partner BMAL1 enhance microglial infiltration into the GBM TME through olfactomedin‐like 3 and legumain upregulation. Inhibiting CLOCK–olfactomedin‐like 3–HIF1α–legumain–CD162 axis impairs microglial infiltration and increases CD8+T‐cell infiltration, activation, and cytotoxicity, and synergizes with anti‐PD‐1 therapy. Additionally, studies have revealed additional targetable chemokine‐receptor pairs. For instance, bone morphogenetic protein‐4 (BMP4) promotes astrocytes and suppresses oligodendrocyte differentiation in GSCs [327]. Single‐cell transcriptome profiling indicates that oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1/2 (OLIG1/2) expression can predict the treatment efficacy after BMP4 treatment and upregulation ofRpl27aandRps27. This marks the early efficacy of treatment with BMP4, which contributes to precision medicine in that patients could be stratified alternatively in novel clinical trial. Moreover, poor antigen presentation is a major obstacle to immunotherapy of GBM. Single‐cell transcriptomic data suggest that the MET–STAT4–PD‐L1 axis may enforce glioma immune evasion while activation of the MET pathway induces upregulation of PD‐L1, revealing a potential treatment using a combination of MET and PD‐L1 inhibitors [213]. However, targeting the axes of TAM infiltration may not be completely curative. For instance, scRNA‐seq data analysis disclose that GBM tumors from C‐C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)‐knockout mice harbor a reduced TAM subpopulation with macrophage signatures (Tgfbi,Clec12a, andFxyd5) [328]. Conversely, an increased subpopulation with microglia signatures (Sall1,Tmem119, andP2ry12) indicates that the antitumor effect of CCR2 inhibition can be attenuated by increased microglia.

The second strategy is to target newly discovered TAM subpopulations. For instance, DCs and PD‐L1+TAM are promising targetable cell populations. Researchers have demonstrated that PD‐L1 blockade is more effective than dual cytotoxic t‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4/PD‐1 blockade in the S28 model. Targeting PD‐L1 combined with stereotactic radiation suggests effectiveness in prolonged survival of mice with intracerebral SB28 tumors at the cost of increased Tregs [211]. Moreover, targeting CD73‐high macrophages through depletion of CD73 extend the survival of GBM‐bearing mice, and anti‐PD‐1 and anti‐CTLA4 therapies further improve this effect [286]. Moreover, CD73 is identified as mainly derived from GBM cells [329]. Therefore, using anti‐CD73 antibodies and CD73 small‐molecule inhibitors plays a dual role in targeting both CD73‐high macrophages and tumor cells, which has gained promising results in preclinical and early clinical trials [330,331]. CD163+HHMOX1+microglia is another newly discovered microglia subpopulation in GBM. It releases IL‐10, which upregulates granzyme B in T cells via the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK1/2‐inhibitor Ruxolitinib boosted T cell activation by reducing immunosuppressive programs in myeloid cells, with patients with GBM clinically living for 2 years after Ruxolitinib treatment [287]. The newly identified GPNMB‐high macrophage plays a crucial role in PMT transition through immune cell‐tumor interplay. Moreover, GPNMB‐high macrophage subpopulations can ineffectively retain T cells from activating by DCs by competing with DCs. Therefore, targeting the GPNMB‐high macrophage subset may benefit in controlling GBM plasticity and facilitate T cell‐based immunotherapy [212]. Consequently, these findings suggest that these TAM subpopulations are immunosuppressive, which are potential therapeutic targets. However, TAMs are heterogeneous, and immune‐activating subpopulations still exist. Newly identified CD169+macrophage subpopulations contribute to antitumor immunity against GBM, facilitating phagocytosis through ligand binding on apoptotic tumor cells and boosting tumor‐specific T‐cell responses through CD169. IFN‐γ from NK cells plays an essential role in the infiltration of CD169+macrophage, and targeting this pathway could promote a proinflammatory TME with glioma [219]. Therefore, these TAM subpopulations are promising targets for the treatment of patients with GBM.

The integration of single‐cell and spatial multiomics technologies has revolutionized our understanding of CNS diseases, offering unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, microenvironmental dynamics, and molecular cascades driving neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and injury. By correlating transcriptional states, epigenetic landscapes, protein interactions, and metabolic fluxes within their native spatial contexts, these approaches have identified novel biomarker, uncovered therapeutic target, and refined patient stratification frameworks.

However, critical challenges and opportunities for innovation remain. For example, (1)Dynamic and temporal gaps. Most technologies provide static snapshots, failing to capture real‐time metabolic fluxes or epigenetic remodeling during disease progression. Neurodegenerative diseases like AD require longitudinal multiomics to dissect Aβ plaque evolution and tau propagation. (2)Data integration complexity. Crossmodal alignment like transcriptome‐metabolome‐proteome is hindered by technical noise, batch effects, and missing data. Integrating scRNA‐seq with spatial proteomics demands robust normalization algorithms to resolve cell‐type‐specific signaling gradients. (3)Clinical translation barriers. High costs, tissue availability, and computational expertise limit widespread adoption in clinical settings.

Several directions hold great promise. (1)Subcellular and live‐cell multiomics sequencing. Multiomics in situ pairwise sequencing (MiP‐seq), a method for simultaneous detection of DNA, RNA, proteins, and biomolecules at subcellular resolution [72]. MiP‐seq can be combined with in vivo calcium imaging and Raman imaging to generate spatial multiomics maps of mouse brain tissue and correlate gene expression with neuronal activity and cellular biochemical fingerprints. (2)Integration of multiomics data. Advanced computational capabilities and more sophisticated algorithms are required to deeply integrate single‐cell and spatial multiomics data, enabling the construction of comprehensive biomolecular networks and regulatory models. For instance, a recently developed tool, genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), enables the spatial localization of trait‐relevant cells by integrating high‐resolution ST data with summary statistics from GWAS [332]. GsMap employs a graph neural network to integrate gene expression profiles, spatial coordinates, and cell type prior information. Based on the cosine similarity of the learned embedding vectors, it identifies homogeneous spots for each spot to form a microdomain, then calculates the gene specificity score (GSS) for each spot by comparing the ranked gene expression within the identified microdomain against the ST dataset. Subsequently, the spot‐level GSS is mapped to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression is utilized to evaluate the enrichment of trait heritability for the SNP–GSS annotations. Finally, the Cauchy combination test is applied to integrate thepvalues of spots within a spatial region. Researchers utilized gsMap to map human complex traits to brain spatial ST dataset from mouse and macaque, revealing that the cerebral cortex exhibited the strongest associations with the majority of the investigated traits. Furthermore, they spatially localized a specific class of glutamatergic neurons exhibiting a high relevant with depression. (3)Full‐length ST. Full‐length transcriptomics enables the acquisition of complete sequences of individual transcript molecules, thereby allowing accurately analyzing the transcript isomers. Current mainstream platforms can achieve high throughput [333], high sensitivity [334], and high accuracy [335] while providing long reading. Applying advancements in full‐length transcriptomics to ST holds the theoretical potential to yield spatially resolved full‐length sequence information. For example, spatial isoform transcriptomics (SiT), which integrates the Visium platform with Oxford Nanopore Sequencing technology, revealed regional isoform switching of the Plp1 across different layers of the olfactory bulb and determined the specific cell types expressing each isoform by leveraging single‐cell datasets [336]. However, SiT's spatial resolution is constrained by the inherent limitations of the Visium platform, and the assignment efficiency of Nanopore sequencing reads to spatial locations is currently lower than that achievable with Illumina sequencing. Consequently, the development of more mature full‐length ST technologies represents a highly promising avenue for development. Progress in such technologies will empower researchers to gain deeper insights into the mechanistic roles of posttranscriptional modifications in CNS diseases. (4)Advance of open‐source repositories. Establish global consortia to standardize data formats and share multiomics datasets. Currently available single‐cell multiomics databases include Single Cell Portal [337], Human Cell Atlas [338], UCSC Cell Browser [339], and Tabula Sapiens [340]; spatial multiomics databases encompass HuBMAP [341] and SpatialOMx (Table3).

ScRNA‐seq and ST technologies have strengthened the study of CNS diseases with unprecedented power by combining multiomics sequencing, including proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics, to decipher the cellular and molecular landscape and even spatially parse these data. We believe that scRNA‐seq and ST technologies will enable the characterization of diseased brains at cell type and even subcellular resolution and provide valuable information for designing new therapies for patients with CNS disorders. Moreover, the emerging single‐cell multiomics technologies will lead to the discovery of new vistas in studying disease mechanisms, precision treatment, and clinical applications.
