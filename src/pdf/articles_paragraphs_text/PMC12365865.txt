Vrn‐A1(VERNALIZATION A1) andFr‐A2(FROST RESISTANCE A2) have been associated with variation in winter survival of wheat (Triticum aestivumL.). The beneficial alleles ofVrn‐A1andFr‐A2are largely fixed in Canadian winter wheat germplasm, rendering the associated molecular markers ineffective for marker‐assisted selection (MAS) in elite populations. The objectives were to (i) identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for winter survival in eastern Canada and determine their usefulness for MAS and (ii) explore the underlying genetic mechanisms of superior winter survival in the region. A subpopulation (n= 321) of the Canadian Winter Wheat Diversity Panel, consisting of genotypes that were fixed for the beneficial alleles ofvrn‐A1andFr‐A2, was previously evaluated for winter survival in three eastern Canadian environments (Elora 2016–2017, CÉROM 2017–2018, and Elora 2017–2018). Genome‐wide association mapping identified three significant QTLs for winter survival, a previously identified QTL on chromosome 5A, and two novel QTLs on chromosomes 5D and 7B. These QTLs were of low‐to‐moderate marker utility (0.1473–0.4796) and conferred a 0.7%–1.8% increase in mean winter survival. In silico analyses revealed that an array of biotic and abiotic stress responses are implicated in winter survival in eastern Canada, which challenges the notion that lethal temperature is the primary cause of winterkill in some regions. As significant winterkill events are sporadic in the region, it may be beneficial to identify individual components of winter survival that can be examined in artificial environments.

Significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were found in the 3T (winter tolerant) subpopulation.

Applicability for marker‐assisted selection is limited in elite population.

Different environments initiated unique physiological responses, which present a challenge when breeding for abiotic stressors.

The ability for winter wheat to withstand the variable conditions of winter is key to their survival. This study sought to (i) identify genetic markers for winter survival in eastern Canadian wheat and (ii) determine if they had regional significance. A large panel of diverse winter wheat genotypes was evaluated across three environments from 2016 to 2018. A genome‐wide association study identified three significant markers that had the potential to be used in winter wheat breeding; however, there was little overlap across environments. As significant winterkill events are sporadic, future studies should utilize individual components of winter survival that can be examined in artificial environments.

Plant breeders require an understanding of the genetic elements that underlie a trait of interest to inform breeding strategies. For example, genomic selection (GS) is effective for quantitative traits, those controlled by numerous genes of small effect on the population mean, while traits that are controlled by few genes of large effect can be improved using marker‐assisted selection (MAS) (Pandurangan et al.,2021; Watson et al.,2019). Winter survival in eastern Canadian winter wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) is currently maintained through selection indices; however, the improvement of adaptive traits in an increasingly variable climate may require a more intensive approach (Crain et al.,2018,2017; T. Zhang et al.,2022). Numerous studies have noted the complex nature of winter survival in cereal species (S. Liu, Yang, et al.,2014; Soleimani et al.,2022; Zhao et al.,2013), and there has been renewed interest in the improvement of winter survival using both MAS and GS (Beil et al.,2019; Michel et al.,2019).

In cereal species, winter survival is often equated with superior cold tolerance (Larsen et al.,2018; Willick et al.,2020). Two functional molecular markers for cold tolerance,Fr‐1(FROST RESISTANCE 1) andFr‐A2(FROST RESISTANCE A2), are widely reported (Sutka & Snape,1989; Vágújfalvi et al.,2003).Fr‐1is the pleiotropic effect ofVrn‐A1(VERNALIZATION A1), a key regulatory gene of the floral induction pathway (Dhillon et al.,2010).Vrn‐A1exists in different copy numbers, with a higher copy number of the recessivevrn‐A1allele associated with a longer vernalization requirement (Díaz et al.,2012) and increased cold tolerance (Würschum et al.,2015; Zhu et al.,2014).Fr‐A2consists of a cluster of 11CBF(C‐repeat binding factor) genes that are upregulated by low temperature (Miller et al.,2006; Vágújfalvi et al.,2005). A higher copy number of the coreCBF‐A14gene (referred to as the tolerant “T” haplotype) is also associated with increased freezing tolerance (Sieber et al.,2016; Zhu et al.,2014). However, the use of molecular markers for the improvement of winter survival has been limited in Canadian wheat breeding programs (Randhawa et al.,2013; Toth et al.,2019).

Intense selective pressures from the environment often fix major beneficial alleles for adaptive traits in regional populations (Hoffmann & Hercus,2000; Olson‐Manning et al.,2012; Orr,1998), and there is a noted geographic distribution of beneficial alleles for these traits (Kreyling et al.,2019). Functional molecular markers associated with these beneficial alleles are useful when moving exotic germplasm into breeding populations (Pandurangan et al.,2021). However, these molecular markers are fixed for beneficial alleles (i.e., have low marker utility) and have little impact on the phenotypic mean in populations derived from elite, locally adapted cultivars (Bernardo,2020; Platten et al.,2019). This is the case forVrn‐A1andFr‐A2in Canadian winter wheat germplasm. The Canadian Winter Wheat Diversity Panel (CWWDP;n= 450) is a diverse collection of Canadian wheat genotypes curated by the University of Guelph (Sidhu,2020). This panel comprises ancestral, historical, and modern genotypes, as well as germplasm sourced from various Canadian wheat breeding programs. A significant proportion (70.8%) of the CWWDP was fixed for three copies of the recessivevrn‐A1allele and the “T” haplotype ofFr‐A2(Figure1; Chen,2019). However, genotypic variation (p< 0.0001) was still observed in this subpopulation (hereafter referred to as “3T”) (Chen,2019). Other genomic regions underlying regional adaptation to eastern Canadian production regions may explain this variation and are of interest for functional molecular marker development.

S, susceptible; T, tolerant.

Genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) are commonly used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for phenotypic variation in plants (Tibbs Cortes et al.,2021). Diverse populations are commonly used for GWASs to maximize linkage disequilibrium (LD) and to identify results that are broadly applicable. By evaluating a regional population, where phenotypic differences are largely restricted to variation in the founder germplasm, there is increased statistical power to detect QTL of local significance (Brachi et al.,2011). Association mapping also provides the opportunity to explore causal genes underlying a trait of interest. At present, our understanding of cold tolerance mechanisms is based on fundamental research in model species (Arabidopsis thaliana,Oryza sativa, etc.) or specific wheat cultivars studied in controlled environments (Ding et al.,2019; Guo et al.,2018; Hassan et al.,2021). Winter survival is largely equated to superior cold tolerance in western Canadian winter wheat (Larsen et al.,2018; Willick et al.,2020). The primary cause of winterkill in winter wheat grown in eastern Canada is not known, and research in other species suggests it is the cumulative effect of multiple stress tolerances, including extreme temperature, cold‐induced desiccation, frost heaving, low‐temperature pathogens, flooding and ice encasement, and thaw‐refreeze cycles (Bélanger et al.,2006; He et al.,2019).

Causal genes underlying winter survival in elite eastern Canadian winter wheat populations warrant further investigation and may result in a more targeted trait of interest for the University of Guelph Winter Wheat Breeding Program. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (i) identify QTLs for winter survival in eastern Canada and determine their usefulness for MAS and (ii) explore the underlying genetic mechanisms of superior winter survival in the region.

A notable subpopulation (n= 321) of the CWWDP harbored three copies of the recessivevrn‐A1allele and the tolerant “T” haplotype ofFr‐A2. This subpopulation (“3T”) had significantly higher winter survival when compared to othervrn‐A1/Fr‐A2combinations (Figure1; Chen et al.,2024). However, significant variation (p< 0.0001; Table1) in winter survival was also observed among the “3T” genotypes and prompted further investigation. A complete list of “3T” genotypes can be found in Supporting Information1.

Combined analysis of variance for winter survival in the “3T” subpopulation of the Canadian Winter Wheat Diversity Panel (CWWDP).

Note: The CWWDP population was assessed in three eastern Canadian environments: Elora 2016–2017, CÉROM 2017–2018, and Elora 2017–2018.

Significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were found in the 3T (winter tolerant) subpopulation.

Applicability for marker‐assisted selection is limited in elite population.

Different environments initiated unique physiological responses, which present a challenge when breeding for abiotic stressors.

Field survival data for the CWWDP was obtained from Chen (2019). Genotypes were grown in a two‐replicate alpha‐lattice design across three location‐year environments, at the Elora Research Station in Elora, ON, during the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 seasons and at CÉROM in Saint‐Mathiew‐de‐Beloeil, QC, during the 2017–2018 season. Each plot comprised six rows with 7.8‐cm row spacing and varied in length, either 1 or 2 m. Winter survival was visually assessed and scored on a scale of 0 (no plants remaining) to 100 (all plants remaining) for each plot immediately following the spring thaw (Chen,2019).

Genotyping was performed by Chen (2019) and used a genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS) approach following the methodology outlined by Poland et al. (2012). DNA extraction was carried out using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Single‐end sequencing of multiplex GBS libraries was performed on two chips (per 96‐plex GBS library) of Ion Torrent (Proton; Thermo‐Fisher Scientific) at Plateforme d'analyses génomiques, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes, Université Laval (Quebec City, QC, Canada).

Processing of next‐generation sequence reads was performed using the Fast‐GBS pipeline (Torkamaneh et al.,2017). Demultiplexing of FASTQ files based on barcode sequences was followed by read trimming and mapping to the IWGSC Chinese Spring v1.0 wheat reference genome (IWGSC,2018). Identification of nucleotide variants from the mapped reads was carried out, and variants were filtered to exclude those with two or more alternate alleles, QUAL score < 32, MQ score < 30, and read depth < 2.

A genotypic data file for the “3T” subpopulation with 35,634 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was extracted using TASSEL 5.0 (Bradbury et al.,2007). Missing data imputation was performed using Beagle v5 (Browning & Browning,2007) within VCFtools v.0.1.16 (Danecek et al.,2011), following the methods described in Torkamaneh and Belzile (2015) and Torkamaneh et al. (2018). The SNP dataset was further filtered based on a minor allele frequency ≥0.05 and maximum missing data of 80%. Heterozygous SNPs were treated as missing data. The resulting genotypic data file had 20,645 SNPs.

GWAS analyses were performed for individual and combined environments using the Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT3; Wang & Zhang,2021) in RStudio (v. 2023.3.0.277; Posit Software). To account for population structure and relatedness, both kinship and principal component analysis (PCA) were integrated into the analysis, withP+K* identified as the optimal model fit. The significance threshold was determined by Bonferroni correction using the negative log(1/n) method (Noble,2009; M. Wang et al.,2012). For the identification of QTL related to winter survival, two statistical methods were utilized: FarmCPU (X. Liu et al.,2016) and BLINK (Huang et al.,2018). The mean LD decay for the entire genome was determined through PopLDDecay (C. Zhang et al.,2019).

The second metric was the predicted change in mean value for winter survival, which was determined by subtracting the population mean from the LSMEAN values for each. The LSMEAN values were obtained using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4, with “Genotype” filtered by allele.

An in silico search for candidate genes was conducted using the Wheat IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 reference genome. WheatMine (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/WheatMine/) served as the primary tool for identifying candidate genes within the 254 kb region surrounding each significant QTL, as determined by LD decay. To identify candidate genes with known molecular functions, Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool was used to matchTriticum aestivumL. hypothetical proteins against those with established functions in the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Furthermore, orthologues of the candidate genes were identified in related species, includingArabidopsis thalianaandOryza sativa, through the UniProtKB database (http://uniprot.org/).

The CWWDP was assessed for winter survival in a three‐location multi‐environment trial during the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 seasons (Chen,2019). Population mean, minimum, and maximum values for winter survival in the “3T” subpopulation are presented in Table2. CÉROM 2017–2018 exhibited the lowest mean winter survival (58.9 ± 7.0%, standard error) and the highest variation (CV = 29.54%). Moderate winter conditions were observed at Elora in 2016–2017 (77.9 ± 1.0%; CV = 10.64) and 2017–2018 (78.9 ± 1.5%; CV = 9.97; FigureS1). Combined winter survival data displayed negative skewness with a mean survival of 71.9 ± 2.5% (FigureS2; Table1). “Genotype” and “Genotype × Environment” were significant (p< 0.0001) in the combined dataset, while “Environment” was not significant (p= 0.0695; Table1). “Genotype” was also significant (pranged from < 0.0001 to 0.0107) in each individual environment (TablesS1–S3). Broad‐sense heritability (H2) was calculated for each environment and ranged from 0.2273 (CÉROM 2017–2018) to 0.6584 (Elora 2017–2018).H2was 0.3341 in the combined dataset (Table2).

Note: The CWWDP population was assessed in three eastern Canadian environments: Elora 2016–2017, CÉROM 2017–2018 and Elora 2017–2018.

Note that 20,645 high‐quality SNPs were used for genome‐wide association mapping. PCA did not reveal genetically distinct subsets in the “3T” subpopulation (FigureS3). One QTL associated with winter survival was identified on chromosomes 5A, 5D, and 7B, respectively, for the combined environments (Figure2; Table3). QTLs were also identified in individual environments, Elora 2016–2017 (three QTLs) and CÉROM 2017–2018 (two QTLs); however, none were identified in Elora 2017–2018 (FigureS4; TablesS4andS5).

Combined least square mean values were generated from Elora 2016–2017, CÉROM 2017–2018, and Elora 2017–2018 winter survival data. The FarmCPU and BLINK methods in the Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT3) were used to identify quantitative trait loci, with a significance threshold of −Log10(1/n) = 5.62.

QTL were named in continuity with previous studies utilizing the Canadian Winter Wheat Diversity Panel (Chen,2019; Chen et al.,2019).

QWs.ugw‐7B.2(Kukri_c12581_163) had the strongest effect on winter survival and explained 16.31% of observed phenotypic variation in the combined dataset (Table3). Marker utility is beneficial for selection in a given genetic background. In the case of winter survival, markers with higher utility may introduce new alleles into the gene pool, which could then play a role in increasing winter survival. QWS.UGW‐7B.2 had moderate marker utility (U =0.4796), with the beneficial allele present in 52.0% of the population (Table4).QWs.ugw‐5A.5(BobWhite_c5540_416) also had a strong effect on winter survival (12.41% variance explained; Table3); however, the beneficial allele was largely fixed in the population (∼85.3%), resulting in a low marker utility score (U =0.1473; Table4).QWs.ugw‐5D.1(wsnp_CAP11_c209_198467) had the smallest impact on winter survival (5.40% variance explained; Table3) but had moderate marker utility (U =0.4639). The beneficial allele occurred in 53.6% of the population (Table4).

Note: Utility score defines the ability of a marker to introgress a beneficial allele into a target population, while predicted change defines the expected increase in mean winter survival.

QTL were named in continuity with previous studies utilizing the Canadian Winter Wheat Diversity Panel (Chen,2019; Chen et al.,2019).

Superior winter survival was conferred by a distinct genotypic combination (5A[C]/5D[C]/7B[T]; Figure3); genotypes carrying the beneficial alleles of all three QTLs. This group had significantly greater winter survival (76.1 ± 0.9%) compared to the population mean (+4.2% above the population mean). Individually, the beneficial alleles ofQWs.ugw‐5A.5,QWs.ugw‐5D.1, andQWs.ugw‐7B.2provided a 0.7%, 1.5%, and 1.8% advantage in winter survival (Table4).

Boxes indicate the median (black line), 25th percentile and 75th percentile of winter survival data, while dots represent outliers. The number of lines in each group (n) are also displayed.

Nineteen putative candidate genes were identified in the flanking regions (±254 kb; FigureS5) ofQWs.ugw‐5A.5,QWs.ugw‐5D.1, andQWs.ugw‐7B.2(Table5), and 12 had previous associations with stress response (Table5; in bold). A MYC2‐like transcription factor (TraesCS5A02G306700), a cell division cycle (CDC) 5‐like protein (TraesCS5A02G307100), and two serine carboxypeptidase‐like (SCPL) proteins (TraesCS5A02G307200andTraesCS5A02G307400) were associated withQWs.ugw‐5A.5. An At3g13620‐like probable polyamine transporter (TraesCS5D02G531700) and an eIF1AD eukaryotic translation factor protein (TraesCS5D02G532300) were associated withQWs.ugw‐5D.1. Two cytosolic sulfotransferase (SOT) 5‐like proteins (TraesCS7B02G475800andTraesCS7B02G476000), an Asp1‐like aspartic proteinase (TraesCS7B02G475600), and three flavin‐containing monooxygenase (FMO) 1‐like proteins (TraesCS7B02G475700,TraesCS7B02G475900, andTraesCS7B02G476100) were associated withQWs.ugw‐7B.2.

Note: The CWWDP population was assessed in three eastern Canadian environments: Elora 2016–2017, CÉROM 2017–2018, and Elora 2017–2018. The “3T” subpopulation consists of genotypes with three copies of the recessivevrn‐A1allele and the tolerant ‘T’ haplotype atFr‐A2. Bolded rows correspond to putative candidate genes that had previous associations with stress response.

Although winterkill is the cumulative result of numerous biotic and abiotic stresses, lethal temperature is often considered the primary cause of winterkill. As a result, many mapping studies conducted in winter wheat have focused on the identification of cold tolerance‐related QTL in controlled environments (Baga et al.,2007; Case et al.,2014; Fowler et al.,2016; Kandel et al.,2018; Motomura et al.,2013; Rojas‐Gutierrez et al.,2022; Sofalian et al.,2008; Vaitkeviciute et al.,2023). Several additional studies have identified winter survival‐related QTLs in the natural environment, with putative QTLs located on all 21 chromosomes (Fowler et al.,2016; Pang et al.,2021; Vaitkeviciute et al.,2023; Zhao et al.,2020; Zhao et al.,2013).

As cold tolerance is just one component of winter survival and most winter survival‐related QTLs were identified in different environments compared to the Great Lakes Basin, these loci may have limited applicability for MAS in eastern Canada. Chen (2019) was the first to identify putative winter survival‐related QTLs in eastern Canada using the CWWDP. In this study, three additional winter survival‐related QTLs were identified in the “3T” subpopulation of the CWWDP. These QTLs were located on chromosomes 5A, 5D, and 7B and had been masked by the major effects ofVrn‐A1andFr‐A2in the initial study. The QTL on chromosome 5A (QWS.ugw‐5A.5) was previously identified by Chen (2019) but had a small effect on the phenotypic mean of the CWWDP.

QWs.ugw‐7B.2explained 16.31% of phenotypic variation in the “3T” subpopulation but did not colocalize with known cold tolerance or winter survival‐related QTLs and therefore is novel. Instead, this genomic region had previous associations with root architecture and drought tolerance, and no known KASP markers have been developed (Iannucci et al.,2017; Maccaferri et al.,2016). Candidate genes forQWs.ugw‐7B.2included two cytosolic SOT 5‐like proteins (TraesCS7B02G475800andTraesCS7B02G476000), an Asp1‐like aspartic proteinase (TraesCS7B02G475600), and three FMO 1‐like proteins (TraesCS7B02G475700,TraesCS7B02G475900, andTraesCS7B02G476100; Table5). AtSOT5 is a negative regulator of kaempferol, a well‐characterized flavonoid with antioxidant properties that has been implicated in drought and cold tolerance (Hashiguchi et al.,2013; Jan et al.,2022; Zhao et al.,2020). Upregulation of Asp1‐like aspartic proteinases has been observed under salt stress, drought, and low nitrogen conditions (Alshameri et al.,2020; Luo et al.,2019; Xin et al.,2021), but their specific role in abiotic stress response is unclear. Overexpression ofFMO1has been associated with increased systemic acquired pathogen resistance (via detoxification of pathogen‐derived compounds), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and programmed cell death (Koch et al.,2006; Mishina & Zeier,2006; Olszak et al.,2006).

QWS.ugw‐5A.5explained 12.41% of phenotypic variation in the “3T” subpopulation and colocalized with a well‐characterized region associated with cold tolerance and winter survival, and no known KASP markers have been developed (Case et al.,2014; Soleimani et al.,2022; Zhao et al.,2020). Interestingly, the beneficial allele ofQWs.ugw‐5A.5occurred at high frequency (85.3%) in the “3T” subpopulation and may highlight a regional adaptation for increased winter survival in eastern Canada (Table3). Candidate genes forQWs.ugw‐5A.5included a MYC2‐like transcription factor (TraesCS5A02G306700), a CDC 5‐like protein (TraesCS5A02G307100), and two SCPL proteins (TraesCS5A02G307200andTraesCS5A02G307400; Table5). In wheat, TaMYC2 activates TaICE41, a homolog of AtICE1, to induce theICE‐CBF‐CORcold‐responsive pathway (R. Wang et al.,2022). The role of MYC2 has also been reported in jasmonic acid‐mediated drought tolerance, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biotic stress tolerance (reviewed in Song et al., [2022]). CDC5 has been implicated in the miRNA‐mediated regulation of abscisic acid signaling and floral induction (Ferdous et al.,2017; Hua et al.,2019), and a number ofTaSCPLgenes have been identified with drought‐, ABA‐, and methyl jasmonate‐responsive elements located in the promoter sequences (Xu et al.,2021). However, the role of CDC5 and TaSCPL proteins in cold tolerance has yet to be examined in wheat.

QWs.ugw‐5D.1explained 5.40% of phenotypic variation in the “3T” subpopulation and did not colocalize with known cold tolerance or winter survival‐related QTLs and therefore is novel. This genomic region had previous associations with disease resistance, and a functional KASP marker has been developed (Hu et al.,2020; S. Liu, Yang, et al.,2014). Candidate genes forQWs.ugw‐5D.1included an At3g13620‐like probable polyamine transporter (TraesCS5D02G531700) and an eIF1AD eukaryotic translation factor protein (TraesCS5D02G532300; Table5).At3g13620encodes a probable polyamine transporter with homology to LmPOT1 (Leishmania major) and TcPAT12 (Trypanosoma cruzi), high‐affinity transporters for putrescine and spermidine (Carrillo et al.,2006; Ge,2011; Hasne & Ullman,2005). Increased antioxidant activity has been associated with the accumulation of polyamines (Seo et al.,2019; Sheteiwy et al.,2017). The accumulation of putrescine and spermidine has been noted in wheat during cold acclimation, with significantly higher quantities observed in cold‐hardy wheat cultivars compared to non‐hardy cultivars (Asghar et al.,2021; Handa & Mattoo,2010). The eIF1 protein subfamily is also known to mitigate cellular damage by regulating antioxidant and enzymatic activity (Yang et al.,2017), and the overexpression ofeIF1Ahas been widely reported in response to salt and osmotic stress in wheat (Latha et al.,2004; Rangan et al.,2009; Rausell et al.,2003; Sun & Hong,2013; Yang et al.,2017).

Several of the underlying candidate genes identified in this study were associated with the accumulation of ROS or with ROS scavenging. This suggests that redox homeostasis, in addition to cold tolerance, is important for winter survival in eastern Canada. ROS are important signaling molecules in systemic acquired acclimation and allow plants to regulate a variety of biological responses to environmental stimuli (Suzuki et al.,2013; Zandalinas et al.,2019). However, the low heritability of winter survival in the combined dataset (H2= 0.3341) may suggest that the primary cause of winterkill differs across eastern Canada. Comparing field survival indices across a large geographic area may have identified a generic stress response rather than the unique genetic mechanisms required for survival in individual macro‐environments.

For example,QWs.ugw‐5A.5was also identified in CÉROM 2017–2018 (13.29% observed phenotypic variation) and suggests that lethal temperature has a larger impact on winter survival in southern Quebec than it does in southern Ontario. QTLs associated with cold tolerance were not identified in Elora 2016–2017. In this environment, 54.4% of observed phenotypic variation was attributed to a single QTL on chromosome 2B (QWs.ugw‐2B.1; TableS4). This QTL colocalized withTraesCS2B02G209300, a gene encoding an IMPAIRED IN BABA‐INDUCED STERILITY 1 (IBS)‐like protein (TableS6) involved in the priming of salicylic acid‐dependent stress response pathways (Slaughter et al.,2012; Ton et al.,2005). Significant winter survival‐related QTLs were not identified in Elora 2017–2018. This environment had low variation in winter survival (CV = 9.97%) and highlights an additional challenge for winter wheat breeders in eastern Canada. Significant winterkill events occur sporadically in southern and central Ontario (approximately one in 8 years; Statistics Canada,1997,2007,2019). Germplasm is often evaluated in moderate winter environments (similar to Elora 2016–2017 and Elora 2017–2018), which are unlikely to represent significant winterkill events in the region. Additional research is required to define macro‐environments for winterkill in eastern Canada and identify the primary cause of winterkill in southern and central Ontario.

Previous research has elucidated differences in outputs from models including FarmCPU and BLINK (Huang et al.,2018). Comparative studies have identified an increase in the false positive rate associated with FarmCPU, which may explain some of the lack of consensus between the two models utilized in this study (Cebeci et al.,2023; Sandhu et al.,2024). Furthermore, the high degree of genotype‐by‐environment variability observed across location‐years in this study may have also played a factor in the absence of overlap in QTL markers.

Three significant winter survival‐related QTLs were identified in this study (on chromosomes 5A, 5D, and 7B). As their impact on mean winter survival was minimal (0.7%–1.8%), these QTLs are unlikely to improve winter survival in populations derived from elite eastern Canadian cultivars via MAS. However, the beneficial alleles for these QTLs were prevalent in Canadian winter wheat germplasm. Functional markers derived from these QTLs may be useful in introgressing non‐adapted germplasm into eastern Canadian winter wheat breeding programs. Candidate genes associated with these QTLs functioned in redox homeostasis and known cold response pathways. Candidate genes identified in individual environments highlighted varying biological responses associated with winter survival.

Additional research is required to identify macro‐environments with similar causes of winterkill in eastern Canada. Field survival indices within these macro‐environments may provide higher quality phenotypic data and highlight specific biological responses required for winter survival in these regions. Winterkill events also occur sporadically in the main winter wheat production regions of eastern Canada. This creates an additional challenge for plant breeders, as many testing environments are not representative of significant winterkill events. The development of functional molecular markers with high marker utility associated with specific causes of winterkill or the use of phenotyping methods (e.g., low‐temperature 50, threshold induction temperature, and vegetative‐to‐reproductive transition) under artificial conditions may help to differentiate between genotypes in the absence of significant environmental stress.
