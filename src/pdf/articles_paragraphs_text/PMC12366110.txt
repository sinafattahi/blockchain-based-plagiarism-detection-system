Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability.

In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level ofp< 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software.

Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability.

The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.

Respiratory symptoms associated with coronaviruses, characterized by their distinctive crown-like spike proteins (derived from the Latin word “corona”) [1,2], have gained significant attention due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. This virus has not only caused acute respiratory infections but also led to severe organ damage, contributing to an alarming rise in global morbidity and mortality rates [3,4]. While many individuals recover from the acute phase of COVID-19, a growing body of research indicates that the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection could profoundly impact patients’ quality of life and their ability to resume daily activities and employment [5,6]. Common persistent symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue, anosmia, chest pain, ageusia, cognitive impairment, and arthralgia, which may manifest weeks after the initial infection [7–9]. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind these lingering symptoms remain poorly understood, but they appear to stem from a complex interplay of immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and potential direct viral effects on host tissues. Notably, the infection prompts an innate immune response characterized by an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and a procoagulant state, which may contribute to cellular damage [10–12]. Recent studies have begun to explore the implications of DNA damage in this context, suggesting that viral manifestations may induce genomic instability, thus providing a rationale to investigate DNA damage as a potential underlying mechanism contributing to long-COVID symptoms. However, the direct causal links between DNA damage and specific long-COVID symptoms necessitate careful examination, particularly given that the current study is observational and cannot definitively infer causation but may identify correlations [13–15]. It is essential to acknowledge numerous potential confounders that might contribute to observed DNA damage, including systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, ICU interventions, pharmacologic exposures, and nutritional states [16–18]. The variability in symptom presentation among individuals recovering from COVID-19 may also be significantly influenced by these factors, alongside age, pre-existing medical conditions, and the severity of the acute infection [19–21]. Understanding these complexities is crucial as ongoing investigations strive to untangle the multifactorial nature of post-COVID-19 syndrome and identify effective therapeutic strategies that address the broad spectrum of symptoms linked to this condition [22]. Moreover, a critical understanding of the necessity for continuous patient care following acute COVID-19 is essential for addressing symptom persistence beyond four weeks [18]. Rehabilitation programs that incorporate physical and cognitive therapies are currently being evaluated to aid in recovery, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive, patient-centered approach that considers mental health as well, given the prevalence of depression and anxiety among individuals recovering from the illness [23,24]. Ultimately, prioritizing patient education and support can empower individuals to seek medical assistance and engage in practices that promote their recovery and overall well-being [25]. In summary, while recovery from acute COVID-19 is common, post-COVID-19 syndrome’s emergence poses significant challenges for healthcare providers. The exploration of DNA damage as a possible contributing factor to long-COVID symptoms is a novel area of inquiry that may yield crucial insights, necessitating further research focused on this potential linkage to enhance clinical outcomes for affected patients.

The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (Ethics Committee) of Azad University of Damghan, and all procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki (study code of ethics: IR.IAU.DAMGHAN.REC.1400.005).

In this cross-sectional study, levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. A total of 29 patients admitted to Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran in December 2024 were selected via a convenience sampling method and categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Participants received informed written consent and met the following criteria: age over 18 years and under 60 years old, non-smokers, no infectious disease (at least 30 days prior to study entry), not pregnant, and no underlying medical conditions.

Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients and controls using sterile swabs. RNA was extracted from the swab samples using the Perkin Elmer Chemagic 360 system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the swabs were placed in viral transport medium, and RNA was isolated using magnetic bead-based extraction. The extracted RNA was subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Viasure SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR detection kit (Cer Test Biotec SL, Spain). The kit targets the N1 and N2 genes of SARS-CoV-2. Each reaction mix included 5 µl of extracted RNA and 15 µl of master mix (containing primers, probes, and enzymes). The RT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 15 min, initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, and amplification for 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s.

The Ct values were recorded for each sample, with lower Ct values indicating higher viral loads. Based on the Ct values, patients were classified into the following severity groups: mild (non-ICU): Ct values > 30 (lower viral load), moderate (non-intubated ICU): Ct values 20–30 (moderate viral load), severe/critical (intubated ICU): Ct values < 20 (high viral load). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (Ct values ≥ 40 or undetectable) were included as the control group.

Blood samples were collected eight hours prior to the comet assay. Using Singh et al.‘s standard technique with modifications, 2 ml of heparinized blood was mixed with 2 ml of Ficoll and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A suspension of 10 µl of PBMCs was mixed with 80 µl of 0.7% low-melting-point agarose at 37 °C, and the mixture was placed on slides under coverslips at 4 °C for solidification. The slides were then treated with a lysing solution containing Tris-HCl, EDTA, NaCl, SDS, and Triton X100 at low temperature (4 °C) before being incubated with alkaline electrophoresis buffer for 30 min (10 M NaOH and 200 mM EDTA-2Na) in an electrophoresis apparatus (25 V/300 mA for 25 min). Post-drying, slides were neutralized, stained with ethidium bromide, and analyzed using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope. Comet assay images were analyzed quantitatively with OpenComet software. The damage index (DI) was calculated using formulas from Ivancsits et al. [26] and Li et al. [27].

Descriptive statistics (mean ± standard deviation, frequency) were used to present demographic data. Chi-square tests compared demographic variables across groups. To assess differences in comet means, T-tests and paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed after confirming normality and variance equality with Levene’s test and K-S tests. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons of assessment indices. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate correlations between DNA damage parameters and symptom severity. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.01, and analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 software.

The participant cohort consisted of individuals aged 18–59 years, with an average weight (referring to a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range (18.5–24.9 kg/m²) [28]), without underlying medical conditions, and who had no intake of vitamins C or D, allowing for appropriate comparison with healthy controls. The demographics of COVID-19 patients during the post-COVID-19 period are summarized in Table1. The intubated-ICU group has the highest median age (46 years), indicating that older individuals are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. The non-ICU group has the youngest median age (27 years). Males are more numerous than females in all groups, with the highest proportion in the intubated-ICU group (87.5%). The control group has an equal distribution of males and females (50% each). Figure1is a bar graph comparing the prevalence of various symptoms across four groups: healthy controls, non-ICU patients, non-intubated-ICU patients, and intubated-ICU patients. The symptoms listed on the x-axis include dyspnea, chest pain, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, widespread myalgia, loss of olfactory and gustatory function, fatigue, tightness of the chest, chills or sweats, and dry cough. The y-axis represents the percentage of individuals within each group experiencing each symptom.

Dyspnea: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (63.5%), non-intubated-ICU patients (56.1%), non-ICU patients (41.7%), and healthy subjects (1.6%). Dyspnea is significantly increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01), and dyspnea is higher in intubated-ICU patients than in all symptoms across all groups (p< 0.01).

Chest pain: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (5.5%), non-intubated-ICU patients (8.3%), non-ICU patients (3.4%), and healthy subjects (1.9%). Chest pain is increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects but is significant only in the non-intubated group (p< 0.01) and is very mild compared to all symptoms in all patient groups. This symptom is higher in non-intubated-ICU patients compared to other patients (p< 0.01).

Arthralgia: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (10.1%), non-intubated-ICU patients (10.3%), non-ICU patients (10.2%), and healthy subjects (1.3%). It is increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01) and is very mild compared to all symptoms in all patient groups. There is no significant difference between the 3 patient groups in this symptom (p> 0.01).

Musculoskeletal pain: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (13.3%), non-intubated-ICU patients (15.6%), non-ICU patients (17.8%), and healthy subjects (1.2%). It is increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01) and is very mild compared to all symptoms in all patient groups. This symptom is higher in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients (p< 0.01).

Widespread myalgia: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (5.3%), non-intubated-ICU patients (9.1%), non-ICU patients (2.8%), and healthy subjects (1.4%). It is increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01) and is very mild compared to all symptoms in all patient groups. This symptom is higher in non-intubated-ICU patients than in other patients but is only significant compared to non-ICU patients (p< 0.01).

Loss of smell and taste: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (36.1%), non-intubated ICU patients (19.8%), non-ICU patients (31.3%), and healthy subjects (0%). It is increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01) and is of moderate severity compared to all symptoms in all patient groups. This symptom is less common in non-intubated-ICU patients compared to other patients (p< 0.01).

Fatigue: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (51.5%), non-intubated-ICU patients (39.9%), non-ICU patients (24.1%), and healthy subjects (0%). It is increased in all 3 patient groups compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01) and is of high severity compared to all symptoms in all patient groups. Fatigue is higher in intubated-ICU patients than in all others (p< 0.01).

Tightness of the chest: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (3.4%), non-intubated ICU patients (4.7%), non-ICU patients (2.1%), and healthy subjects (1.9%). It is more common in ICU patients than in healthy subjects, but the difference between any patient groups and healthy subjects is not significant (p> 0.01). This symptom is less common than all symptoms in all patient groups and is very mild.

Chills or sweats: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (43.2%), non-intubated-ICU patients (37.4%), non-ICU patients (22.2%), and healthy subjects (1.1%). It is more common in all patients than in healthy subjects (p< 0.01). There is no significant difference between ICU patients (p> 0.01), but non-ICU patients are less common than all (p< 0.01). This symptom is more severe than all symptoms in all patient groups.

Dry cough: This symptom is present in intubated-ICU patients (45.6%), non-intubated-ICU patients (46.4%), non-ICU patients (33.7%), and healthy subjects (2.4%). It is increased in all patients compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01). There is no significant difference between ICU patients (p> 0.01), but non-ICU patients show lower frequency than all others (p< 0.01). This symptom is more severe than all symptoms in all patient groups.

The Fig.1illustrates the relationship between disease severity and symptom prevalence. Intubated-ICU patients typically show a higher rate of symptoms, indicating a more severe disease state. Within patient groups, there seems to be a trend of increasing symptom burden with increasing disease severity, evidenced by the higher prevalence of symptoms in intubated-ICU patients compared to non-intubated-ICU patients and non-ICU patients. Dyspnea, loss of smell and taste, fatigue, and chills are significantly more common in patients, especially in intubated-ICU cases.

An example of DNA damage among the groups studied is depicted in Fig.2, indicating that tail length correlates with the degree of DNA breakage, particularly in the intubated-ICU and non-intubated-ICU groups. The intubated-ICU group exhibited the highest levels of DNA damage during the post-COVID-19 phase, significantly lower than controls. All groups exhibited higher DNA damage when compared to the control group. Among COVID-19 severity phenotypes, the intubated-ICU group showed the most significant damage, followed by non-intubated-ICU patients. In Fig.2, a cell with a normal nucleus and intact DNA, without a comet-like tail, is seen, which is called intact DNA. A cell with fragmented DNA is seen, where part of the DNA has broken away from the nucleus, forming a comet-like trail. The tail represents the damaged DNA fragments that have migrated due to electrophoresis. The head of the comet is called the nucleus, and the tail is called the DNA fragments. Small, medium, and large tails, which are precisely measured by the software, indicate different degrees of DNA damage. Smaller tails indicate less damage, while longer tails indicate more severe damage.

Tail Length (µm): The intubated-ICU patients exhibited a mean tail length of 22.4 μm, corresponding to the highest level of DNA damage. In comparison, non-intubated-ICU patients had a tail length of 15.4 μm, non-ICU patients had 7.9 μm, and healthy subjects showed a tail length of 3.8 μm. Each of these parameters indicated a significant increase in DNA damage in all three patient groups compared to healthy individuals (p< 0.01), with the highest damage observed in the intubated group.

Tail Intensity (% DNA in tail): This parameter measured the percentage of DNA present in the tail. Intubated-ICU patients had a mean tail intensity of 25.2%, non-intubated-ICU patients 25.8%, non-ICU patients 19.6%, and healthy subjects 5.1%. All three patient groups exhibited increased rates of DNA damage compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01), with the ICU patient group showing a significant increase compared to non-ICU patients (p< 0.01).

Tail Moment: This unitless parameter is calculated as the product of tail length (in µm) and tail intensity (expressed as a percentage). The tail moment values for the groups were as follows: 11.5 (intubated-ICU), 6.6 (non-intubated-ICU), 6.1 (non-ICU), and 1.4 (healthy individuals). All groups showed increased tail moment values compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01). No significant difference existed between non-intubated-ICU and non-ICU groups (p> 0.01), although both had significantly lower tail moments than the intubated-ICU patients (p< 0.01).

Tail Factor: This parameter was measured at values of 14.2 for intubated-ICU patients, 10.1 for non-intubated-ICU patients, 5.9 for non-ICU patients, and 3.3 for healthy subjects. Increased tail factor rates were observed in all groups compared to healthy individuals (p< 0.01), with the consistent order of damage being: intubated-ICU, non-intubated-ICU, and non-ICU (p< 0.01).

Tail DNA Percentage: Measurements showed that the percentage of DNA in the tail was at 10.9% for intubated-ICU patients, 7.1% for non-intubated-ICU patients, 7.2% for non-ICU patients, and 1.1% for healthy subjects. Again, all three patient groups had significantly higher results compared to healthy subjects (p< 0.01), with no significant difference between non-intubated-ICU and non-ICU patients (p> 0.01). Intubated-ICU patients recorded the highest tail DNA percentage. The distribution of DNA damage parameters was noted to be in the following order: tail intensity, tail length, tail moment, tail factor, and tail DNA percentage (Fig.3).

The COVID-19 pandemic has left an indelible mark on global health, with emerging evidence suggesting that even after recovery, many survivors experience persistent symptoms—collectively termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID-19. The most prevalent definition indicates that long COVID-19 is characterized by symptoms persisting for more than three months from the onset of the initial symptoms, although various definitions exist. A review of available literature highlights that fatigue and dyspnea (shortness of breath) are the most frequently reported persistent symptoms associated with long COVID-19 [29–32]. The management and care for individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome are anticipated to present significant challenges for healthcare systems globally. Current findings suggest critical directions for future research, particularly concerning the underlying pathophysiological processes associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Although numerous studies have provided intricate biological explanations for this condition, there still remains a gap in our understanding of the physiological pathways and mechanisms involved. As the long-term consequences of COVID-19 become more apparent, further information is expected to inform therapeutic approaches. Persistent abnormalities were observed in the cardiovascular system; for instance, 29% of 79 COVID-19 survivors exhibited radiological signs of ventricular remodeling three months after hospital discharge [33]. Miwa et al. [34] reported concerning statistics showing that 90% of patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation continued to experience lung-related complications 100 days post-treatment, while 47% of those who did not require such ventilation displayed significant, prolonged reductions in pulmonary function. Furthermore, many individuals experience post-acute sequelae after receiving treatment for acute COVID-19. Chopra et al. [35] conducted an analysis on the long-term effects of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, revealing that a notable proportion reported ongoing symptoms like fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive challenges even months post-discharge. This underscores the critical need for thorough follow-up care for individuals recovering from COVID-19, as many may struggle to regain their prior levels of health and activity [36]. The similarities in symptoms between post-COVID-19 syndrome and established autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, suggest that shared pathogenic mechanisms may be at work in individuals recovering from COVID-19 [37–39]. This emphasizes the necessity for ongoing research to better elucidate the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on immune function and the potential for targeted therapies to manage these autoimmune manifestations.

Respiratory Symptoms (dyspnea, dry cough) and oxidative lung damage: Intubated-ICU patients had the highest dyspnea (63.5%) and tail length (23.2%). Mechanical ventilation, hypoxia, and cytokine storms may induce oxidative DNA breaks in lung epithelial cells, which impair long-term respiratory function [40]. Fatigue and mitochondrial DNA damage: Fatigue (51.5% in intubated-ICU) correlated with high tail moment (11.5%). SARS-CoV-2 may disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to energy depletion and chronic fatigue [41]. Neurological symptoms (loss of smell/taste) and neuronal DNA damage: Viral invasion of olfactory neurons may cause DNA damage that delays neural regeneration [42,43]. Systemic inflammation and musculoskeletal pain: Musculoskeletal pain (17.8% in non-ICU) associated with moderate tail factor (5.9%). Persistent inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) may contribute to DNA damage in muscle and joint tissues [44,45]. The persistence of DNA damage raises concerns about long-term health consequences, including: Unrepaired DNA breaks may lead to oncogenic mutations, particularly in severely affected patients. Chronic genomic instability is linked to telomere shortening and cellular senescence, potentially accelerating aging-related diseases. Damaged DNA fragments may trigger autoantibodies, contributing to autoimmune-like symptoms in long COVID-19 [46–49].

Our study found that higher DNA damage correlates with more severe and persistent symptoms, particularly in ICU survivors. By employing the alkaline comet assay, we demonstrated that post-COVID-19 patients exhibit significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls, with the severity of COVID-19 directly correlating with the extent of genomic instability. The highest levels of DNA damage were observed in intubated-ICU patients, followed by non-intubated-ICU and non-ICU patients. This suggests that the virus’s impact on the genome is not merely transient but may persist long after the acute phase of infection. This genomic instability could be a key factor underlying the enigmatic post-COVID-19 syndrome, a condition characterized by persistent symptoms that continue to afflict millions of survivors worldwide. The damage to DNA, as evidenced in this study, may contribute to a cascade of cellular dysfunctions, including impaired repair mechanisms, increased oxidative stress, and potential mutations that could predispose individuals to long-term health complications, such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, or even malignancies.

This study adds a novel biological dimension to our understanding of post-COVID-19 syndrome, highlighting that the virus’s impact extends far beyond the respiratory system. The genomic instability observed in survivors suggests that COVID-19 may leave a lasting imprint on the cellular level, potentially altering the trajectory of health in ways that are only beginning to be understood. This raises critical questions about the long-term consequences of the pandemic and underscores the need for targeted interventions to mitigate these effects. As we move forward, it is imperative to explore the mechanisms driving this genomic instability, whether through direct viral interference, immune-mediated damage, or systemic inflammation—and to develop strategies to protect or repair the genome in post-COVID-19 patients. This study serves as a call to action for further research into the biological underpinnings of post-COVID-19 syndrome, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for the millions of survivors who continue to grapple with its silent legacy. Future research should investigate whether this damage is reversible and whether targeted therapies (e.g., antioxidants, anti-inflammatories) can mitigate long-term effects. This review provides significant data aimed at enhancing our understanding of the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the necessity for research on DNA damage associated with specific viral agents. Understanding the physiological changes during COVID-19 could inform the development of subsequent conditions, identify symptom clusters associated with different levels of disease severity, and help clinicians prioritize patient care, allocate resources based on observed symptom burden, and develop prognostic models for predicting disease outcomes. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the temporal relationship between symptoms and disease progression, and studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm the statistical significance of the findings and assess the generalizability of the results to different populations.

The findings of this study unveil a silent yet profound legacy of COVID-19: genomic instability as a potential driver of long-term health complications in survivors. In conclusion, COVID-19 is not just a transient infection but a catalyst for long-term genomic disruption, leaving behind a trail of cellular damage that may shape the health of survivors for years to come. Understanding and addressing this silent legacy will be crucial in the ongoing battle against the pandemic’s enduring aftermath.
