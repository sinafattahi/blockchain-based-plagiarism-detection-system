Serious outcomes of COVID-19 may include admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Multiple risk factors exist which may contribute to these outcomes. The aim of the study, employing a large national dataset, was to assess roles of smoking, body mass index, metabolic and underlying clinical conditions in ICU admissions and death among those with COVID-19 in Ireland.

The analysis comprised all 1.4 million adult patients who tested positive with COVID-19 between April 2020 and December 2022. A pseudonymised dataset from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) was used; informed consent was waived by the National Health Research Consent Declaration Committee. Key variables above were used, employing both univariate and multivariate analysis. Outcomes were ICU admission and death with COVID-19.

Mean age was 42 years (Standard Deviation (SD) 16.8) and 53% were males. Those admitted to hospital were older (59.2 (14.2)) than those who died (74.9 (12.0)). Increased odds ratios (95% CI) each significantly associated with ICU admission in multivariate models were, current/ex-smokers (2.4 (2.2–2.6)), males (1.8, (1.7–1.9)), and individuals with an underlying clinical condition (10.2 (7.9–13.2)). Odds of death were also significantly increased in presence of an underlying condition (186.129 (137.987-251.066)) but not when age was taken into account as an interaction term.

This comprehensive study confirmed international findings associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Whilst clinical indications for ICU admission and overall mortality may differ in hospitalised patients, the main drivers of mortality are age, underlying conditions and disease severity, irrespective of location.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first identified in China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020 [1,2]. The first case of COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland was reported on 29 February 2020. As of 1 August 2023, a total of 1,715,065 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed [1–3]. The severity of COVID-19 varies and may include life threatening pneumonia known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death [4] and understanding the factors that contribute to severe outcomes remains critical for effective management and resource allocation.

People with obesity are almost 2.42 times more likely to develop severe pneumonia in COVID-19 infection and almost 7 times more likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation [5,6]. Furthermore, Body Mass Index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2has been found to be a strong predictor for hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 infection [7,8]. Additionally, people with dyslipidaemia, hypertension, or obstructive sleep apnoea have higher risk of severity and mortality in COVID-19 infection [9–11]. Metabolic syndrome and its associated risk factors, insulin resistance, high degree of adiposity, vascular endothelial dysfunction and a pro-inflammatory state in the body, has an important role in poor outcomes in COVID-19 disease [12]. The metabolic syndrome is 3 times more prevalent than diabetes mellitus and it is estimated that about a quarter of the world’s population is now affected by it globally [13]. Lifestyle factors including smoking have been found to be independent risk factors in COVID-19 mortality [14].

Among ever smokers, there is 44% excess risk for severity of disease, 16% higher risk of hospitalisation, and almost 40% excess risk for mortality in COVID-19 [15]. Severe or critical COVID-19 disease requires hospital admission and critical care beds, and puts unprecedented pressure on critical care services [16]. In this context, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-European Union (EU) countries have faced unique challenges. There were 5 general beds and 15.9 critical care beds per 1,000 persons on average in 2022, however there were 2.9 and 5.2 in Ireland in the same year, respectively [17].

The objective of the study therefore was to determine comprehensively in Ireland the effects of smoking, metabolic syndrome status and underlying clinical conditions on COVID-19 outcomes (ICU admission and death in the overall population and in those patients admitted to hospital) in those who tested positive with COVID-19 during the pandemic period.

The study population comprised adults (≥ 18 years) who tested positive for COVID-19 in Ireland and were registered in the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting system between April 2020 and December 2022. The pseudonymised dataset was made available by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the organisation responsible for collecting, compiling, analysing, and disseminating statistical information in Ireland, after approval from the CSO, Research Data Governance Board, and after informed consent was waived by the National Health Research Consent Declaration Committee (HRCDC) [18]. Ethical exemption was granted by the University College Dublin (UCD) Human Research Ethics Committee.

This observational study utilised a pseudonymised secondary dataset for its analysis. Significant safeguards were implemented by the CSO as per its Data Management Policy and Codes of Practice. All researchers were required to complete the formally approved ‘CSO Officer of Statistics’ training. The data were provided in the form of a Research Microdata File and were pseudonymised. Identifiers were replaced with a Protected Identifier Key to allow safe linkage across data sources and over time. A single copy of pseudonymised Research Microdata File was transferred to a drive controlled by the Research Coordination Unit (RCU) staff, who made the data available to researchers. The access was provided through the CSO Research Data Portal through approved computers. All outputs were checked by a CSO statistician to ensure data confidentiality and compliance with the CSO statistical disclosure policy prior to release to the researcher.

The key variables of interest in this study were smoking status, metabolic status, and underlying clinical conditions. Metabolic conditions included high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity (BMI > 40), while underlying clinical conditions included a wide range of long-term medical conditions (for e.g. asthma, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, arthritis) and cancer within the study population. Key confounding variables considered were age, gender and ethnicity; and outcome variables were admission to ICU and death due to COVID-19. For the purpose of analysis, a positive history of each metabolic condition (high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity (BMI > 40)) was given a score of 1, to give a score range from 0 to 3. A new categorical variable, metabolic status ≥ 2, was created and included individuals who had 2 or more components of the metabolic syndrome.

Descriptive statistics are presented of key demographic, clinical outcomes and lifestyle variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for ICU admissions and for deaths due to COVID-19 in (1) all adults who had tested positive for COVID-19, and (2) hospitalised adults with COVID-19, to investigate their association with smoking and with underlying metabolic factors (including high BP, diabetes mellitus and obesity) and underlying clinical conditions. Variables significant on univariate analysis and age, gender and ethnicity were included in the multivariate analysis. Interaction terms combining age and metabolic status ≥2 and underlying clinical condition and age were included in the logistic regression models.

Multivariate model 1 analysed variable ‘metabolic 2+’, which included individuals with 2 or more metabolic conditions. The reference category was individuals with 0 or 1 metabolic condition and the model was adjusted for co-variates including age at the time of event, interaction term of metabolic 2 + and age at time of event, current/ex-smoker, White/probable White ethnicity, and male gender. Multivariate model 2 replaced metabolic disease variable with a variable ‘underlying clinical condition’, a variable captured in the CSO database signifying those individuals who had a history of one or more chronic illnesses. The model was adjusted for co-variates including age at the time of event, interaction term of underlying clinical condition and age at time of event, current/ex-smoker, White/probable White ethnicity, and male gender. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. By comparing R values across models, we aimed to assess the incremental explanatory power of adding metabolic and underlying clinical factor separately, as well as interaction terms, to the models. The R value was used to indicate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (ICU admission or mortality) explained by the independent variables included in the logistic regression models. The analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM Corp. Released 2023. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0.2.0 Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).

Table1presents descriptive statistics of 1,408,249 COVID-19 positive adult patients in Ireland. The mean age of the cohort was 42 years (SD = 16.8). Among all adult patients with COVID-19, there were more males (53%) than females. There were more current (3.5%) than ex-smokers (2.2%) among all COVID-19 infected adults and 0.1% had morbid obesity (BMI 40+). However, risk factor data were not available for most respondents. Of those with available smoking status data, 15.6% were current smokers, 9.8% were ex-smokers and 74.5% were never smokers. Of all the COVID-19 patients in the current study, 31,037 (2.2%) individuals required hospital admission, and 4,432 individuals (0.31%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). In total 10,855 (0.8%) people died due to COVID-19.

Table1presents the demographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics of 1,408,249 study participants. Hospital and ICU admissions were more common with older age and male gender. Mortality (0.8%) was higher among older individuals (mean age 74.9 years vs. 41.7 years for survivors). Smoking history (3.5% current, 2.2% former) and obesity (BMI ≥ 40; 0.1%) were less prevalent than seen in the general population in Ireland [19]. White ethnicity was predominant (59.9%), with lower representation of Black (1.5%) and Asian/Middle Eastern (1.9%) groups.

The findings for the three outcome measures (admission, ICU admission and death) are presented in Tables2,3and4. At univariate level for all three outcomes, the variables age, male gender, current or ex-smoker, metabolic 2+, underlying condition were each significant, while White ethnicity was significantly associated with both total deaths and deaths amongst those hospitalised.

Table2presents the results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models analysing association of metabolic status, age, ethnicity, smoking, and underlying clinical condition with death. In the univariate model, people who had two or more metabolic disease categories (OR = 2.049, 95% CI = 1.882–2.230) or with an underlying clinical condition (OR = 49.269, 95% CI = 46.953–51.699) had a higher likelihood of death from COVID-19. Smokers/ex-smokers (OR = 1.814, 95% CI = 1.701–1.933), males (OR = 1.352 95% CI = 1.301–1.404), and patients who were White/probable White (OR = 3.964 95% CI = 3.298–4.765) had a higher likelihood of death.

In multivariate Model 1, the significant association of being male and having two or more metabolic-related diseases each persisted in the multivariate model; however ethnicity and smoking status did not remain significantly associated with death. The combined effect of metabolic status and age had less impact on the risk of COVID-19-related death showing that for each unit change in the interaction term, there was a 1.6% decrease in the risk of death (OR = 0.984, 95% CI = 0.976–0.992).

In the multivariate Model 2, the effect of being a current/ex-smoker had a marginally significant lower likelihood of COVID-19 death. Patients who were of White/probable White ethnicity and patients with underlying clinical condition had a higher likelihood of death due to COVID-19. The combined impact of age and the presence of an underlying clinical condition (OR = 0.970, 95% CI = 0.966–0.974) showed slightly less risk of COVID-19-related death. The R2for Model 1 was 0.259, which included metabolic factors and an interaction term with age, indicating that this model explains 25.9% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality. In contrast, Model 2, which included underlying clinical conditions and an interaction term with age, showed a higher R2of 0.500, indicating that this model explains 50.0% of the variability.

Table3presents the results of univariate and multivariate regression models analysing association of metabolic status, age, ethnicity, smoking, and underlying clinical condition with ICU admissions, who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

In univariate analysis, patients who had two or more metabolic diseases (OR = 2.168, 95% CI = 1.945–2.418), had an underlying clinical condition (OR = 7.239, 95% CI = 6.627–7.908), current or ex-smokers and males had a greater likelihood of ICU admission due to COVID-19.

In multivariate Model 1, metabolic status ≥2, current or ex-smokers and males were each significantly associated with ICU admission. The interaction between Metabolic 2 + and Age at the time of the event was statistically significant (OR = 0.972, 95% CI: 0.962–0.982). This indicates that, for each one-unit increase in age, the odds of the outcome for individuals with Metabolic 2 + decreased by approximately 2.8%. In Multivariate Model 2, current/ex-smoker (OR = 2.408, 95% CI = 2.223–2.608), male patient (OR = 1.797, 95% CI = 1.673–1.930), and having an underlying clinical condition (OR = 10.228, 95% CI = 7.897–13.247) were each significantly associated with ICU admission. The interaction between underlying clinical condition and age at the time of the event was not statistically significant. The R2for Model 1 was 0.219, indicating that metabolic factors and the interaction term with age explained 21.9% of the variability in ICU admissions. Model 2, however, had a slightly higher R2of 0.225, indicating it explains 22.5% of the variability. The relatively modest R2in both models suggests that other unmeasured factors may significantly influence ICU admission risk.

Table4presents the results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models analysing association of metabolic status, age, ethnicity, smoking, at least one ICU admission, and underlying clinical condition with death from COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In the univariate analysis increasing age, being White/probable White, being male, current or ex-smoker, admission to ICU at least once, having an underlying clinical condition and having 2 or more metabolic-type conditions were each significantly associated with death due to COVID-19.

In multivariate Model 1, increasing age and having two or more metabolic-type diseases were significantly associated with death from COVID-19. Being male, current or ex-smoker and those patients who were admitted to ICU were significantly negatively associated with death from COVID-19. The combined effect of metabolic status and age had a significant impact on the risk of COVID-19-related death showing that for each unit change in the interaction term, there was a 1.5% decrease in the risk of death (OR = 0.985, 95% CI = 0.974–0.996). In multivariate Model 2, increasing age was the only factor significantly associated with death from COVID-19. Being male, admission to ICU at least once (OR = 0.198, 95% CI = 0.180–0.219), patients with underlying clinical condition (OR = 0.190, 95% CI = 0.110–0.326) had significantly less likelihood for COVID-19 death. The R2for Model 1 (0.211) indicated that metabolic factors explained 21.1% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality among hospitalised patients. Model 2 (0.312) showed improved explanatory power, with underlying clinical conditions accounting for 31.2% of the variability.

This comprehensive analysis of all recorded incident cases of COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland demonstrates how the presence of metabolic syndrome, underlying health conditions, and smoking each impact the outcome of COVID-19. We showed that severe outcomes such as ICU admission and death, both in the general population and among individuals admitted to hospitals are associated with these underlying conditions and with lifestyle risk factors such as obesity and smoking.

This study is novel in that it employed the national CSO database and involved use of a very large pseudonymised secondary dataset. A total of over 1.4 million individual adult records were analysed. We confirm what other studies in the international literature have identified, that risks factors like increasing age, being male and co-morbidities are associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 [2,20–31]. Notably, the role of obesity and smoking been found to be of significant impact in other studies also [8,15,20,27,30–33].

The mean age of participants in the current study was younger, reflecting the fact that it employed a community-based dataset which is a notable strength of our analysis because of inclusion of all COVID-19 cases in Irish population. A weekly report by the Centres of Disease Control (CDC) on October 2020 showed that the median age of COVID-19 cases over time declined from 46 years in May 2020 to 37 years in July 2020 and remained at 38 years in August 2020 [34]. By contrast, a cohort study in the United States of America (USA) analysed 2215 patients in ICU with COVID-19 and showed that participants’ mean age was 60.5 years [35]. Similarly the mean age was 67 years in another cohort study [36] from Italy which analysed hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in 2020.

The fact that smoking is clearly consistently associated with ICU admission, but not so with death from COVID-19, either for all deaths or from deaths amongst those hospitalised and indeed in the adjusted multivariate models showed a marginally reduced association, may be because the strongest drivers for mortality were the severity of the disease in itself and established underlying disease. In turn previous lifetime smoking is of course a risk factor for many morbidities. It could also be due to differential ascertainment bias, in that smoking status was more likely to be recorded in those hospitalised with severe disease, particularly if admitted to ICU. A systematic review and metanalysis by Abate et al. (2020) analysed 221,195 participants in 57 studies and showed that more males (55%) were affected as compared to females (45%) with COVID-19. The study further showed that it may have been related to higher smoking and alcohol consumption, although discrepancy in infection rate among males could be multifactorial [37]. A smaller study in Ireland also showed similar higher proportions of males (59.5%) who were infected with COVID-19 [30].

A strength of this analysis was its consideration of ethnicity. Whilst 60% of the cohort constituted individuals categorised in the dataset as White, the remainder included probable-White, Black, Asian and Traveller or Roma communities. Travellers are a unique ethnic minority on the island of Ireland who experience adverse health [38] and this is shown here for COVID-19 also. An Irish study done in 2021 showed similarly a higher proportion of COVID-19 infection amongst the White population (63.8%) and also found 14.2% admissions to hospital and 7.5% deaths [30]. In our analysis, there were 2.2% admissions to hospitals and 0.8% deaths among all those who were infected with COVID-19. Again, this reflects both the large sample size and comprehensive community ascertainment of cases.

The outcome of death among those infected with COVID-19 was significantly associated with being male and having two or more metabolic-related diseases. Similar gender differences in COVID-19 death have been reported in other studies, including from Ireland [20,39,40]. A systematic review and metanalysis done by Huang et al. (2020) in China analysed 45,650 from 30 studies and revealed a higher risk of death in COVID-19 among those with higher BMI [8]. Another study in the USA in 2020 retrospectively analysed 200 patients and found that higher BMI ≥ 35 was again independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality [41]. Furthermore, similar a higher proportion of death was reported among the obese population in a prospective cohort study in Italy [42]. The fact that studies in different countries with varying health care systems share common drivers of adverse outcomes suggest that the disease itself is the adverse driver. Among various mechanisms associated with COVID-19 severity, adipose tissue has been implicated, with increased Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) expression linked with more lung injury in COVID-19 [43–45].

Smoking independently had a negative effect on mortality due to COVID-19, both among all adults and for those who were hospitalised. Lippi and Henry in 2020 also showed negative effects of smoking on severity of COVID-19 [46] and another study by Vardavas and Nikitara in same year also reported similar results [47]. An updated metanalysis concluded that smoking was positively associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 [48]. Another systematic review reported similar findings [49]. It has been posited that there may be a smoker’s paradox in relation to COVID 19, as seen in other contexts but the evidence base for this is scanty [50]. Another Irish study which included patients just from first wave of COVID-19 between March and July in 2020 revealed positive associations with age, high BMI, those with asthma and chronic cardiac disease [20].

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) continues to regularly monitor deaths from COVID-19 [51] and most recent data confirm what has been the case from the outset, that whilst 56.2% of deaths occurred in hospital, the remainder did not and deaths in residential institutions, including nursing homes accounted for 28% of all deaths. These rates were even higher in the earliest waves of the pandemic [52]. The fact that our data show similar risk factors for mortality, whether in hospital or overall, supports the view that age, severity of disease and underlying conditions are the drivers for mortality, irrespective of location. The early public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland included several key measures aimed at mitigating transmission, particularly in long-term residential care (LTRC) settings. Stronger governance, infection prevention and control (IPC), testing priorities, personal protective equipment (PPE) and oxygen supplies, staff training, and LTRC preparedness plans were all part of Ireland’s early COVID-19 response as described in the Expert Panel Report on Nursing Homes [52]. Variability in SARS-CoV-2 variants was associated with differing transmissibility, severity, and immune escape characteristics. Between April 2020 and December 2022, the pattern of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ireland showed the initial dominance of the original strain gradually replaced by variants of concern, including Alpha (B.1.1.7) in late 2020, Delta (B.1.617.2) in mid-2021, followed by Omicron (B.1.1.529) and its sub lineages becoming prevalent from late 2021 through 2022 [53]. Ireland introduced a strong vaccination programme focused initially on the most vulnerable groups in December 29, 2020, achieving one of the highest uptake rates in the world [54]. However, the vaccination roll out in the main took place after the period covered in this study.

There are a number of limitations. Our study included only those patients who died while hospitalised and did not include any further follow up thus potentially underestimating deaths in those who were admitted in ICU but later died after discharge. A multicentric cohort study from the USA in 2020 with prospective follow-up for 28 days found that 4 in 10 patients had died [34]. While this is a very sizeable dataset, it does not include detailed information on treatment and care or diagnostic laboratory data across the population. Emerging systematic evidence suggests the importance of corticosteroids and novel therapeutic regimens in management of those with COVID-19, particularly those requiring admission and with severe disease. We recognise that there could be disproportionate access to healthcare depending on socio-economic position and education level affecting ascertainment and early access to treatments to COVID-19 [55].

This is a novel, national analysis of a large and comprehensive dataset of over 1.4 million individuals in Ireland, adding to the evidence base for Identifications of factors responsible for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. This can guide early intervention in high-risk patients, provide evidence-based information for public health policy makers to target population identified with risk factors with appropriate public health strategies, contribute to development of healthcare guidelines for management of COVID-19 in high-risk individuals. Although findings from current study align with previous studies, the study analysed COVID-19 outcomes across a broad population rather than specific subgroups and includes additional outcome measures. It further reinforces the need for health promotion strategies to combat smoking and obesity.
