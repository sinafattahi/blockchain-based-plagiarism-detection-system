This study aimed to investigate variations in root and canal morphology of the mandibular second molars in a Chinese Kazakh population using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).

A total of 374 mandibular second molars from 236 patients were included in the retrospective study. The mandibular second molars were categorized based on the radiographic morphology of their external roots: non-fused roots (NFR), fused roots (FR), and single roots with a single canal (SS). The configuration of the C-shaped canal at three different levels was categorized into C1-C5. A chi-square test was employed to assess the association between the incidence of C-shaped root canals and demographic factors such as sex and tooth position.

Mandibular second molars typically had two roots. C-shaped root canals appeared in 33.1% of second molars. The C-shaped form was most prominent in C3, followed by C1. Sex and tooth position did not exhibit notable differences.

The incidence of C-shaped root canals in the Chinese Kazakh population was similar to that previously reported in Asian populations and higher than in Caucasian and Middle Eastern populations.

Root canal systems can have various anatomical differences, some of which might greatly complicate endodontic treatments. Failure to adequately explore, prepare, and obturate all canals may result in unsuccessful endodontic treatment [1]. The posterior position of the mandibular molar presents challenges related to limited mouth opening and restricted visual access during the procedure. The occurrence of atypical root canal morphologies, particularly C-shaped root canals, complicates endodontic treatment. The configuration of C-shaped root canal systems may change along the root’s length and occasionally show a thin lingual canal wall. As a result, this ribbon-like canal might be linked to a hazardous area, which can heighten the difficulties faced by clinicians during the processes of cleaning, shaping, and obturation [2]. The term “C-shaped canal” was first introduced by Cooke and Cox in 1979 to describe roots with a cross-sectional configuration resembling the letter “C” [3]. It has been documented that C-shaped canals are prevalent in mandibular second molars, with rates ranging from 3.5–45.5% based on the population under study [4–6]. Furthermore, these canal configurations can be observed in maxillary molars, mandibular premolars, and maxillary lateral incisors [7–9].

Various methodologies, including canal staining and tooth clearing, conventional radiographs, digital radiographic techniques, radiographic assessment enhanced with contrast media, and more recently, micro-CT and cone-beam CT (CBCT), have been employed to examine canal configurations [10–15]. Periapical radiographs, due to their two-dimensional nature and image superimposition, fail to show the full extent of root canal complexity with precision [16]. Micro-CT scanning offers high resolution, but due to high radiation, it is mostly used to observe extracted teeth [17]. CBCT technology offers clinicians a noninvasive, three-dimensional method, without damaging samples, enabling the evaluation of specific anatomical features, such as grooves and notches [1,18]. Few studies are available on the morphology of mandibular second molars in the Chinese Kazakh population using CBCT. Therefore, this study aimed to use CBCT to assess the root and canal morphology of the mandibular second permanent molars in the Chinese Kazakh population.

The study was designed to evaluate the root canal configuration of mandibular second molars using CBCT scans, undertaken at Tacheng Regional People’s Hospital in Xinjiang Province, China, for different dental reasons. CBCT scans of 236 Kazakh patients were included in the study. This represented a convenience sample, and all available examinations were screened. Clinical trial number: Not applicable. This study received approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of the China Medical University Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, as it adheres to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and relevant medical ethics standards. Informed written consent was obtained from the participant. Protocol ID: China Medical University and Stomatology Hospital (2022) Scientific Ethics Review (No. 80). The molar specimens to be included in the present study were selected according to the following criteria: presence of mandibular second molars with fully matured roots, no periapical lesions or root canal fillings, and high-quality imaging. Exclusion criteria encompassed teeth exhibiting retained deciduous molars, open apices, root resorption, or a history of endodontic treatment.

CBCT images were acquired using a Kavo scanner (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, PA, USA) with the following parameters: an 85 mm field of view, 120 kVp, 5 mA, a 6-second exposure duration, and a voxel size of 0.2 mm. I-CAT Vision software (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, USA) analyzed CBCT images in three standard planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) with a slice thickness of 1 mm. Two endodontists independently evaluated the images twice, with a 30-day gap between evaluations, and subsequently proofread the data. Any discrepancies between the observers were resolved through consultation with a third evaluator, a professional oral radiologist. The kappa test was employed to ensure the reliability and consistency of the data.

b: Non-fused roots with convergent configurations (NFRII).

c: Fused roots with mesial and distal root canals merging apically (FRI).

d: Fused roots with independent mesial and distal canals (FRII).

e: Fused roots with a distal canal curving toward a radiolucent line and a longer mesial canal following its own path (FRIII).

C1: A continuous C-shaped root canal with no separation.

C2: A comma-shaped root canal, resulting in a non-continuous C-shaped root canal (mesio-buccal-distal canal and a mesio-lingual canal).

C4: Only one root canal (round or oval in cross-section).

C5: No canal lumen is seen, being visible only near the apex.

The chi-square test was employed to assess the association between the incidence of C-shaped morphologies and demographic factors such as sex and tooth position. Statistical significance was considered at ap-value threshold of less than 0.05 for all analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software (IBM; Armonk, NY, USA).

A cohort of 236 patients, comprising 93 males and 143 females underwent CBCT imaging. A total of 374 mandibular second molars were analyzed from these images. The kappa test showed good agreement for the same examiner (Kappa = 0.71) and for the two examiners (Kappa = 0.65).

Mandibular second molars predominantly exhibited two separate roots, observed in 68.5% of cases. A single root structure was observed in 31.6% (Table1). Radiographic analysis of the root configuration in mandibular second molars revealed that the NFRI classification was the most prevalent, accounting for 44.4% of cases. The NFRII classification followed, representing 24.1% of the sample. Additionally, 35 mandibular second molars exhibited fused teeth with merged canals, as depicted in Table2; Fig.3.

The most dominant C-shaped configuration type in the mandibular second molars was C3 (66.7%). In the coronal third, C3(72.1%) was most presented, followed by C2(14.8%). In the middle third, C3(66.4%) was most presented, followed by C1(16.4%) and C2(16.4%). In the apical third, C3(61.5%) was most presented, followed by C1(32%). No instances of C5 were observed in the study (Table3).

C-shaped root canals were observed in 33.1% of these molars. The prevalence of C-shaped root canals in mandibular second molars was not significantly influenced by gender or tooth position, as indicated by the results presented in Table4.

Dental anatomy differences can differ significantly among populations of different ethnicities and geographic regions [21]. There have been no studies on the root canal morphology of the Chinese Kazakh population in the existing literature. This study was the first to analyze the morphology of the roots and canals in the mandibular second molars of this population. The mandibular second molars presented with two separate roots in 68.5% of cases, suggesting that the mandibular second molars mostly have two roots. This observation aligns with findings from other populations [22–24]. The fusion rate was found to be 31.6%. No occurrences of three roots were identified. However, some studies have found the existence of three roots were observed in Brazilian (3.5%) and Thai (0.97%) populations [5,25]. The position of the third root was located distolingually or mesiolingually; two lingual roots should be considered a genetic trait instead of merely a developmental anomaly [26,27]. Park et al. reported that the Mongoloid population has a notably higher occurrence of mandibular molars with three roots compared to other populations [28].

The C-shaped root canal has been identified as a complex anatomical characteristic. Understanding the C-shaped root canal is essential because it significantly affects the effectiveness of root canal treatment in relieving pain and removing infection. The incidence of the C-shaped root canals varies among different populations. According to the current study, 33.1% of mandibular second molars exhibited C-shaped root canals, which was similar to the results reported by Wang et al. (34.6%) and Zheng et al. (39%) [29,30]. However, in studies focusing on the Caucasian population, the prevalence ranges from 3.5–8.5% [5,19]. In Middle Eastern countries, the prevalence increases to 9.1% among Saudi Arabians and Lebanese individuals [31,32]. As a result, C-shaped root canals are more commonly observed in Asian populations, aligning with the findings of Ren et al. [33]. In the study, we assessed the C-shaped root canals in cross-sections of the roots at three different levels: the coronal third, middle third, and apical third. C3 was most prominently observed in the mandibular second molars, consistent with the findings of Pataer et al. on the Uyghur population in Xinjiang and Martins et al. on the Portuguese population [19,34]. In the clinical management of mandibular second molars, it is crucial to consider the potential presence of C-shaped root canals.

The current study indicated no significant difference in the incidence of C-shaped root canals in mandibular second molars between genders. Similar outcomes were observed in both Saudi [23] and Yemeni [35] populations. However, Alfawaz et al. [31] studied the Saudi population and demonstrated that women showed a significantly higher prevalence of C-shaped root canals than men. Additionally, our findings suggested no significant difference in the incidence of C-shaped root canals with respect to tooth location in mandibular second molars. In contrast, Alfawaz et al. [31] reported a higher frequency of unilateral root canals in the Saudi population, and Ladeira et al. [16] observed the same trend in the Brazilian population. According to the study by Zheng et al. on the Chinese population [30], both sides had a higher prevalence. These discrepancies in findings might be attributed to variations in methodology, sample size, ethnicity, or the geographical origin of the samples [29].

The strength of this study was attributed to the collaboration of two endodontists and a radiologist, which enabled a more precise assessment of C-shaped root canals. However, this study utilized a retrospective method, and its sample size was insufficient to represent the whole population. Moreover, micro-CT offers more detailed information than CBCT. Future research will involve prospective studies designed to evaluate C-shaped root canals with greater accuracy, incorporating specific parameters pertinent to the Chinese Kazakh population.

Understanding root morphological variations and conducting a comprehensive preoperative assessment are essential for boosting the success rate of root canal treatments. In the Chinese Kazakh population, the majority of mandibular second molars have two roots. C-shaped root canals are more frequently observed in the Chinese Kazakh population. Statistical analysis revealed no significant variation in the prevalence of C-shaped root canals when stratified by gender or tooth position.
