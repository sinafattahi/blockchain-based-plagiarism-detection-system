This research aimed to evaluate the influence of the systemic immunoinflammatory index (SII) on the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF), as determined by propensity score matching (PSM).

The 218 patients with CHD and HF were divided into the MACE group and the non-MACE group. After balancing the baseline data of the two groups by PSM (76 cases in each group after matching, total sample 152 cases), the diagnostic value of SII for MACE was analyzed using the ROC curve to determine the optimal threshold value. The independent risk factors for MACE were analyzed using multifactorial Cox regression. Kaplan–Meier curves were employed to compare the MACE-free survival rates of patients with varying SII levels.

PSM effectively balanced the baseline characteristics of the two groups, with absolute values of standardized mean difference for all variables < 0.1. Platelet counts, neutrophil counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, SII, C-reactive protein (CRP), and NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (P< 0.05). The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SII after PSM was 0.788 (95% CI 0.714–0.860,P< 0.001), with an optimal threshold of 589.31 (sensitivity 81.58%, specificity 65.79%). Multifactorial Cox analysis showed that SII ≥ 589.31 (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.18–3.14,P= 0.009), elevated CRP (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.23,P= 0.010), and NT-proBNP (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01–1.01,P< 0.001) were independent risk factors for MACE. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the incidence of MACE was significantly higher in the high SII (≥ 589.31) group than in the low SII group (69.30% vs 23.40%,P< 0.05).

Elevated SII increases the risk of MACE in patients with CHD with HF and is associated with poor survival.

The incidence of cardiovascular diseases is rising worldwide, making them the primary cause of mortality [1], with coronary heart disease (CHD) leading the list [2,3]. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a clinical condition resulting from the advanced stages of different heart diseases, such as heart valve disease or ischemic heart disease, with CHD being a primary cause [4]. CHD accounts for up to 19.5% of deaths due to non-communicable diseases [5], making the prognosis of patients with CHD combined with HF a concern. Systemic inflammation caused by metabolic or immune conditions is closely associated with cardiovascular diseases [6]. In the realm of cardiovascular diseases, CHD and HF often coexist in medical practice, influencing each other and perpetuating a negative cycle. The immune-inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the transformation of CHD to HF, which not only promotes the progression of CHD, but also accelerates the process of myocardial remodeling and deterioration of cardiac function. The 5-year mortality rate of patients with CHD and HF is as high as 50%, and the rapid progression of the disease often leads to poor prognosis due to the inability to timely control, which in turn leads to myocardial infarction, recurrent HF, sudden cardiac death, and a series of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [7].

In recent years, the central role of immune inflammatory response in the development of cardiovascular diseases has been gradually revealed [8,9]. CHD is essentially an atherosclerotic disease, and the formation, progression and plaque rupture of atherosclerosis are closely related to chronic inflammation [10]. Hematological markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio have been found to provide useful information for predicting future events in patients with HF [11]. Recently, a new systemic immunoinflammatory index (Systemic immune inflammatory index, SII) has been developed based on platelet count and NLR, which is thought to better reflect local immunity and systemic inflammation [12]. Compared to single inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein, CRP), SII not only encompasses the acute inflammatory response represented by neutrophils and the immunoregulatory function represented by lymphocytes, but also incorporates platelets, a key cell involved in thrombosis and vascular inflammation, and thus may be more sensitive to capture dynamic changes in immune inflammation. SII has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of prognosis for CHD and the predictive value of SII for MACE is superior to traditional risk factors [13]. It is independently associated with cardiovascular and cardioembolic mortality [14] and is regarded as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with advanced CHF and renal insufficiency [15]. SII is readily available through standard blood tests [16]. Quantifying SII may provide critical information for assessing prognosis in patients with CHD combined with HF. Studies have shown that elevated SII is associated with the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CHD, the prognosis of patients with malignant tumors, and the activity of autoimmune diseases, but its predictive value has not yet been adequately validated in the specific population of CHD combined with HF [13].

The control of confounding factors in observational studies is critical to the reliability of the results. The prognosis of patients with CHD combined with HF is influenced by multiple factors, including age, gender, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension and diabetes mellitus), cardiac function (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] and left ventricular end diastolic diameter [LVEDD]), and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking and drinking). If these variables are not effectively balanced, the association of target metrics (e.g., SII) with MACE may be overestimated or underestimated. Propensity score matching (PSM), as a statistical method to match patients in different groups according to scores by constructing a propensity score model (incorporating variables that may affect grouping and prognosis), is able to maximally simulate the conditions of a randomized controlled trial and reduce selection bias and confounding interference.

Based on the above background, the aim of this study was to systematically assess the effect of SII on the occurrence of MACE in patients with coronary artery disease with HF by controlling for baseline confounders through the PSM method. The study first compared the baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients before and after PSM to validate the matching effect, and then analyzed the between-group differences between SII and other inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP) and HF markers (e.g.,n-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP). The optimal cutoff value of SII was further determined by ROC curve and its independent predictive value was clarified by multifactorial Cox regression model. Finally, the prognosis of patients with different SII levels were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier survival curve. The results of the study not only help to deepen the understanding of the role of immunoinflammation in the progression of HF, but also may provide a simple and economical risk stratification tool to guide early intervention for high-risk groups, thus improving the overall prognosis of patients with CHD combined with HF.

This study was a single center, observational, retrospective cohort study. Retrospectively consecutive patients hospitalized in Shanxi Provincial Corps Hospital, Chinese People's Armed Police Force for treatment of CHD combined with HF from December 2020 to December 2023 were included in the study and patients were selected according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Inclusion criteria: (1) Patients who met the diagnostic criteria of chronic HF [17]; (2) patients with CHD as the underlying disease of chronic HF.

Exclusion criteria: (1) HF caused by other cardiovascular diseases, such as acute coronary syndrome, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc.; (2) combination of malignant tumors and severe damage to organ function; (3) systemic infections and autoimmune disorders; (4) chronic illnesses; (5) Immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drugs within 7 days prior to hospitalization; (6) Incomplete clinical information and loss of follow-up.

Ultimately 218 patients were included in the final analysis. The study complied with the ethical criteria of the Ethics Committee of Shanxi Provincial General Hospital, Chinese People's Armed Police Force (No. 2020SX0324).

General clinical data were collected from the patients, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and previous history of hypertension (a history of systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg on three measurements taken on non-simultaneous days; abnormal blood pressure at present, or normal blood pressure with oral antihypertensive medication), diabetes mellitus (a history of fasting blood glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or 2 h glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L on glucose tolerance test or random blood glucose measurement ≥ 11.1 mmol/L), percutaneous coronary intervention, and smoking (≥ 1 cigarette per day for at least 6 m). Family history was defined as a history of CHD in the subject's immediate family, such as parents, brothers, and sisters.

Echocardiographic assessments were conducted on all individuals, with LVEF and LVEDD being measured.

Venous blood specimens were collected from patients within 24 h of admission, and Lab tests were conducted to measure neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, allowing for the calculation of NLR and SII. SII is defined as peripheral platelet count (× 109/L) × NLR from the same blood sample [18]. Laboratory indices such as NT-proBNP and CRP were collected at admission.

Patients were followed up by telephone contact or outpatient services through December 2024, with follow-up times ranging from 1 to 3 years and a median follow-up time of 21 [14,25] months. MACE was defined as a composite endpoint event of cardiac death and rehospitalization for cardiovascular events. It was confirmed as cardiac death after non-cardiac causes were excluded. Rehospitalization was defined as readmission for cardiovascular disease. There were 120 cases in the non-MACE group and 98 cases in the MACE group according to the occurrence of MACE.

SPSS 26.0 software was applied for statistical analysis. Admission SII was calculated. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine normality of data. Measures satisfying normality were expressed as (X ± S), andttest was used for comparison between groups; non-normality measures were expressed as M (P25, P75), and Mann–WhitneyUtest was used for comparison between groups. Count data were expressed as frequency (n) and rate (%), and comparisons between groups were made using the χ2test and Fisher's exact test. PSM was applied to match the baseline information of the two groups including age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of percutaneous coronary intervention, history of smoking, history of drinking, family history of CHD, atrial fibrillation, New York Heart Association classification, LVEDD, and LEVF in a 1:1 matching to eliminate the differences in baseline information between the two groups, and the caliper value of 0.02 yielded the well-balanced MACE group and non-MACE group. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, the Youden index was calculated and the cutoff point was determined. According to the cutoff point, the patients were divided into high SII and low SII groups, and the risk factors affecting the occurrence of MACE were further analyzed by performing a stepwise backward COX proportional risk model withP< 0.05, with SII, NT-proBNP, and CRP as the independent variables, and age, history of drinking, and LVEDD as the corrected variables. Survival prognosis was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and differences were assessed by log-rank test.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Table1demonstrates the baseline information of the MACE and non-MACE groups before and after PSM. Before PSM (total samplen =218), there were significant differences in some of the baseline variables between the two groups: LVEDD was lower in the MACE group (P= 0.003, standardized mean difference [SMD] = − 0.410), age was higher (P= 0.035, SMD 0.333), and the proportion of drinking history was higher (P= 0.032, SMD 0.274). Other variables such as BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, LVEF, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc.) did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups before PSM (P> 0.05). Yet, some variables had absolute SMD values greater than 0.1, such as BMI with an SMD of − 0.295, which implies that there may be a mild imbalance. After PSM (total samplen =152, 76 cases per group), the between-group differences in all baseline variables were significantly reduced: significant differences in LVEDD (P= 0.725, SMD − 0.058), age (P= 0.931, SMD 0.044), and history of drinking (P= 0.563, SMD 0.091) disappeared, and the rest of the variables (e.g., BMI, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, LVEF, gender, comorbidities, etc.) hadP> 0.05 and absolute SMD values < 0.1, suggesting that PSM effectively balanced baseline characteristics between the two groups and provided a reliable basis for confounding control in the subsequent assessment of the effect of SII on MACE.

After PSM, the MACE group had significantly higher levels of several immunoinflammation-related indices and markers of HF than the non-MACE group, including platelet count, neutrophil count, NLR, SII, and CRP. Whereas, there was no significant difference in lymphocyte count between the two groups. In addition, NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in the MACE group. The data suggested that patients in the MACE group experienced a more active immune inflammatory response and more severe HF, laying a laboratory groundwork for further study of the effect of immune-inflammatory indices (e.g., SII) on MACE, as shown in Table2.

The diagnostic value of SII for the occurrence of MACE in patients with coronary artery disease combined with HF was analyzed by ROC curves, and the optimal cutoff value was determined based on the Youden Index (Youden Index, sensitivity + specificity-1) (Table3, Fig.1). Before PSM, the area under the curve (AUC) of SII was 0.711 (95%CI 0.643–0.779,P< 0.001), and the corresponding cutoff value at the maximum of the Yoden index was 603.5, resulting in a sensitivity of 80.83% and a specificity of 57.14%. After PSM, the AUC was elevated to 0.788 (95%CI 0.714–0.860,P< 0.001), and the optimal cutoff value was optimized to 589.31, with a sensitivity of 81.58% and a specificity of 65.79%. The Youden index analysis identified the optimal cutoff value for SII to predict MACE by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity, and the higher AUC and specificity after PSM indicated a more stable diagnostic efficacy of SII after matching, which provided data support for the use of 589.31 as the high-risk cutoff value for SII in the subsequent COX model.

Further by stepwise backward multifactorial Cox analysis withP< 0.05, it was shown that after adjusting for the three confounders of age, drinking history, and LVEDD, SII ≥ 589.31 (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.18 ~ 3.14,P= 0.009), elevated CRP level (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.23,P= 0.010) and elevated NT-proBNP levels (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01–1.01,P< 0.001) were independent risk factors for the development of MACE. Among them, the elevation of SII was significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE, suggesting that immune-inflammatory response may play an important role in the poor prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease combined with HF, as shown in Table4. Covariance diagnostics showed no covariance between age, history of drinking, LVEDD, SII, CRP, and NT-proBNP.

Patients after PSM were divided into high SII group (n =64, ≥ 589.31) and low SII group (n =88, < 589.31). The MACE-free survival rate of patients with different SII levels was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves, and the results are shown in Fig.2. The incidence of MACE in patients in the high SII group was 69.30%, which was significantly lower than the 23.40% in the low SII group (P< 0.05).

CHD is a major factor leading to HF, and individuals with both conditions have a poorer outlook [19]. Patients with HF and concurrent CHD experience more severe cardiac function decline and higher mortality than those without significant CHD [20]. Both acute and chronic HF exhibit systemic inflammation as a shared pathological characteristic [21–23]. The onset, progression, and complications of diseases are associated with inflammation [24,25], and it indicates poor outcomes irrespective of traditional measures, such as LVEF or NYHA classification [26]. Acknowledging PSM's role in controlling confounding elements, the study applied the PSM method to balance other clinical factors that may affect MACE, so as to better assess the relationship between SII and the occurrence of MACE in patients with CHD combined with HF.

SII has been recommended to formulate an inflammation index that is broadly utilized in predicting the outcomes of diseases, such as cancer, heart conditions, and cerebrovascular disorders [27–29]. SII predicts the clinical outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes [30] and MACE after coronary intervention in patients with CHD [13]. Based on ROC curve evaluation criteria, an AUC score under 0.5 signifies no predictive capability, whereas an AUC over 0.9 indicates excellent predictive capability, which is seldom reached in clinical practice. Therefore, an AUC between 0.7 and 0.9 is considered to have good predictive value. This study showed that the AUC of SII was elevated from 0.711 to 0.788 after PSM, and the optimal cutoff value reached 589.31 (sensitivity 81.58%, specificity 65.79%). This enhancement may be attributed to the fact that PSM reduces the interference of confounding factors on the predictive efficacy of SII, making it a truer reflection of the inflammatory features of the disease itself. Multifactorial Cox regression analysis confirmed that SII ≥ 589.31 (HR 1.92), elevated CRP (HR 1.12) and elevated NT-proBNP (HR 1.01) were independent risk factors for MACE. Notably, the effect size of SII (HR 1.92) was higher than that of CRP (HR 1.12), suggesting that it may have more predictive value as a composite indicator than a single inflammatory marker. These findings suggest that SII has some predictive value for the occurrence of MACE in patients with coronary artery disease combined with HF, and that the parameters for calculating SII are simple, easy to obtain, and highly maneuverable, which can be used as an early screening tool for the occurrence of MACE in patients with coronary artery disease combined with HF. Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis further validated the predictive ability of SII for long-term prognosis. Patients in the high SII group (≥ 589.31) had a significantly lower MACE-free survival rate than those in the low SII group, and the difference in the incidence of MACE reached a statistically significant level, aligning with findings from an earlier study [11]. The risk of new-onset in-hospital HF may be associated with the calculation of SII values applied to three types of cells: neutrophils, platelets and lymphocytes. Neutrophils are the main phagocytic cells in the blood and play an extremely central role in inflammatory responses. Neutrophils have been known to exacerbate tissue damage and inflammation in advanced atherosclerosis by triggering smooth muscle cell lysis and death [31]. Activated platelets secrete a number of chemokines that initiate or promote local inflammatory processes at sites of vascular injury and have been implicated in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and atherosclerotic thrombosis [32,33]. Lymphocytes are the smallest white blood cells produced by lymphoid organs and are an important cellular component of the immune response. It has been shown that lower lymphocyte concentrations are associated with atherosclerotic progression [34]. Thus, SII may be a key link between CHD/HF and poor prognosis.

Although this study controlled for known confounders by the PSM method, there are some limitations. First, the study design was a single-center retrospective analysis, which may be subject to selection bias, and future multicenter prospective cohort studies are needed to verify the generalizability of the results. Second, other potential confounders (e.g., medication regimen and inflammation-related gene polymorphisms) were not included, which may have an impact on the predictive efficacy of SII. In addition, the dynamics of SII were not explored, and its time-dependent effect needs to be assessed in conjunction with longitudinal follow-up data. Finally, although the sample size (n =152) after PSM met the statistical requirements, expanding the sample size could improve the robustness of the results, especially for the analysis of rare endpoint events.

In terms of clinical significance, this study provides a new tool for risk stratification of patients with CHD combined with HF. SII, as a simple and cost-effective hematological index, can be rapidly obtained during routine examinations and has high clinical accessibility. By identifying high-risk patients with SII ≥ 589.31, clinicians can initiate targeted interventions earlier, such as intensifying anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g., with IL-1β inhibitors), optimizing antiplatelet strategies, or adapting HF management protocols, thereby reducing the risk of MACE. In addition, the combined application of SII with other biomarkers (e.g., CRP and NT-proBNP) may further optimize the risk prediction model and enable individualized precision medicine.

In conclusion, this study confirmed that elevated SII is an independent risk factor for MACE in patients with CHD with HF by the PSM method, and its predictive efficacy is superior to that of a single inflammatory indicator. SII integrates information from platelets, neutrophils and lymphocytes, which can reflect the state of immune-inflammatory activation more comprehensively, and provide a new strategy for the clinical identification of high-risk patients. In the future, the combination of SII and other biomarkers may further improve the prognostic assessment of patients with CHD combined with HF, guide early intervention, and ultimately reduce the incidence of MACE.
