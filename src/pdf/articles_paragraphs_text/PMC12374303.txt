Pertussis, a highly contagious respiratory disease caused byBordetella pertussis(BP), poses challenges due to genomic variation that may contribute to its persistence in vaccinated populations and the development of antimicrobial resistance.

In this study, we characterized 27 BP isolates collected from Tianjin, China in 2023, using whole-genome sequencing and multilocus genotyping (MGT) to explore their genomic diversity. For comparative analysis, we selected 165 international BP genomes to examine the genomic diversity and evolutionary traits of Tianjin strains within a global context.

The results revealed that all 27 isolates belonged to ST2 (100.0%), with no distinct phylogenetic clustering observed. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis integrating 165 global BP genomes indicated that the Tianjin strains exhibited high genomic homogeneity with globally circulating strains. Specifically, 16 isolates (59.3%) carried the virulence genotypeptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn-150(truncated)/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1, while 11 isolates (40.7%) carried the genotypeptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn150/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1. Additionally, all 27 isolates exhibited complete resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and clindamycin, whereas 18.5% of them were resistant to levofloxacin.

This study elucidates the phylogenetic, genomic characteristics, and drug sensitivity profiles of BP strains isolated in Tianjin, China, in 2023, providing valuable insights into BP persistence in vaccinated populations.

Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of humans primarily caused byBordetella pertussis(BP) [1]. The resurgence of pertussis has been widely reported, posing a significant threat to global public health and raising concerns about vaccine efficacy [2–5]. BP vaccines include whole-cell vaccines and acellular cell vaccines, the latter comprises purified BP proteins, most of which contain filamentous hemagglutinin (Fha), pertussis toxin (Ptx) and pertactin (Prn), while some also include fimbrial proteins (Fim2 and Fim3) [6]. Theptxpromoter (ptxP) is crucial for the efficient translation ofptxmRNA in BP [7]. TheptxPregion includes two major alleles,ptxP-1andptxP-3. Notably,ptxP-3is associated with higher Ptx production compared toptxP-1[8]. Of significant concern is the ongoing spread ofptxP-3strains in China, which exhibit high-level resistance to macrolides, as this trend continues unabated [6]. Similarly, theprngene is responsible for producing Prn, another important surface protein involved in the bacterium’s ability to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. Compared with vaccine strains, different alleles ofptxA,ptxC,ptxP,fim2,fim3,fhaBhave been reported in many countries [1,9].

Despite the diversity in virulence genotypes among circulating strains, various BP subtypes continue to be prevalent globally [10]. Studies have suggested that the selection pressure from vaccine-induced immunity had acted on BP evolution in recent years [11], BP may also be under selective pressure from macrolide antibiotics used for treatment of pertussis such as erythromycin (ERY) or azithromycin (AZM) [12–15], a previous study in China demonstrated that macrolide resistance increased dramatically from 46.5% in 2019 to 97.3% in 2024. Notably, 80% of hospitalized cases with macrolide resistance were initially treated with macrolides [16,17]. Additionally, there was a sharp rise in high-virulence BP strains exhibiting macrolide resistance in northern China during the same period [18].

Applications of high-throughput sequencing have transformed public health microbiology by exploiting the profound resolution of pathogen genomics for effective investigation and surveillance of infectious disease, recently core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) was widely used to develop genotyping systems for BP, as well as specific schemes to define antigenic, virulence and macrolide resistance profiles [19]. The multilocus genotyping (MGT) system for BP showed that different MGT levels provide a distinct and useful characterization of the BP population [20].

In this study, we collected 27 BP culture-positive cases from Tianjin in 2023. After completing whole-genome sequencing (WGS), we analyzed the molecular epidemiological characteristics of these isolates and constructed a phylogenetic tree. To examine the genomic diversity and evolutionary traits of the Tianjin strains within a global context, we compared them with 165 international BP genomes. Using MGT levels, we investigated the distribution of virulence-related genotypes through antigen genotyping for all 27 isolates. Additionally, we conducted antimicrobial susceptibility testing on the 27 isolates and analyzed the correlation between their genetic features and antimicrobial resistance profiles.

Active BP surveillance was conducted at Tianjin Second People’s Hospital from January 1 st to December 31 st, 2023. A total of 27 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from patients with suspected pertussis. All data collection and analytical processes were anonymized. This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and immediately spread onto charcoal agar plates (TSINGTAO SINOVA-HKBIOTECHNOLOGY, China) supplemented with 20% defibrinated sheep blood andBordetellaselective supplement (cephalexin, 40 mg/L) (Thermo Scientific, US). The plates were incubated in a humidified incubator at 35 °C for 3 to 5 days. The isolates were verified by Gram staining, biochemical tests, and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS System, Autobio, China).

Susceptibilities of all 27 BP isolates to ERY, AZM, clarithromycin (CLR), levofloxacin (LEV) and clindamycin (CLI) were detected using E-test method to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(Liofilchem, Italy) [21,22]. Briefly, the BP isolates were suspended to a concentration equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard and inoculated onto charcoal agar containing 10% sheep blood without cephalexin. After 72 h of incubation, the results of BP isolates were read. Currently, there is no international standard for the detection methods or interpretation of antibiotic resistance results for BP. Literature reports indicated that for the E-test method, an MIC range of 32 to > 256 mg/L for macrolides such as ERY is classified as drug-resistant [21,23].

Genomic DNA of BP isolates were extracted using QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN) and WGS were performed on DNBSEQ and PacBio RSII platform. Sequencing data were analyzed as previously described [24] and were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA1297067. Assembled BP genome sequences were used for virulence genotyping by searching against BIGSdb-Pasteur genomic platform forBordetella.20 (https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/Bordetella/)(19). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were analyzed by seven housekeeping genes (adk,fumC,glyA,tyrB,icd,pepA, andpgm), the alleles at each of the seven loci defined the allelic profile or sequence type (ST). MGT assignment used pipelines described previously at the MGTdb [11,20,25].

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified from WGS data of the 27 isolates as described previously [26]. Briefly, after quality filtering and alignment against the BP reference strain Tohama I (accession no. GCA_000195715.1), the kSNP v4.1 was used to generate a core SNP alignment [27] and determined based on kmer with an optimum value of 21. Subsequently, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE with 1,000 bootstrap replicates [28].Visualization of the phylogenetic tree analysis was performed using iTOL v7 (https://itol.embl.de).

The genomes of 165 published strains of Chinese BP and global BP isolates were analyzed and compared. The international reference strain Tohama I was utilized as reference genome sequence. The genomes included in the public dataset originated from six countries and regions, the isolation years for these strains ranged from 1990 to 2024 (see Supplemental Material Appendix Table 1: The public BP genomes dataset in this study). Unprocessed short-read sequencing data were retrieved from the NCBI SRA. The quality of the sequencing data was assessed using FastQC (version 0.11.9), and adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic (version 0.39) and subjected to de novo assembly using SPAdes (version 3.13.1) [26,29]. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the same method described above.

A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the core SNPs identified in a comparison of 27 BP genomes with the Tohama I and the reference strains CS (Chinese vaccine strain, accession no. GCA_023612135.1). 292 SNPs were identified in total, among which 276 (94.5%) were core SNPs. The analysis revealed no distinct phylogenetic clustering among the 27 isolates (Fig.1). All 27 BP isolates were categorized under MLST type 2 (ST2, 100%), with the alleles of the seven housekeeping genes identified asadk-1,fumC-1,glyA-1,tyrB-3,icd-1,pepA-1, andpgm-1. At the MGT1 and MGT2 levels, all 27 isolates were classified as ST-2. At the MGT3 level, they were identified as ST-7. MGT4 analysis categorized 26 isolates as ST-446, with one isolate classified as ST-591. The MGT5 level revealed greater diversity, identifying 16 distinct sequence types. The resolution level of MGT2 matched that of the BP vaccine antigen sequence typing (BPagST), and all isolates shared the BPagST ST-4. Additionally, genes encoding the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) are known to be present in classicalBordetellaspecies. The T3SS types of 27 isolates were all T3SS-3, with the allele profile ofbopB-1/bopD1/bopN-1/bsp22-1/bteA-1. The 23S rRNA allele type of 27 isolates was all 23 S rRNA-13, which carried the only mutation described so far as being associated with macrolide resistance [30].

The E-test identified 27 isolates resistant to ERY, AZM, CLR, and CLI (MIC > 256 mg/L), demonstrating a 100% resistance rate for these antibiotics. Additionally, there were 6 isolates resistant to LEV (MIC > 32 mg/L) and 21 isolates sensitive to LEV (MIC range: 0.19–0.50 mg/L), resulting in an overall resistance rate of 18.5% for LEV (Fig.1).

The genomes of all 192 BP strains (27 isolates from this study and 165 strains from the global public dataset) were aligned using reference strain Tohama I as the outgroup (Fig.2). In total, 5,096 SNPs were identified, including 1,477 core SNPs. Generally, strains isolated in similar years and geographical locations exhibited closer evolutionary relationships. ST2 was the predominant type across all strains (93.7%). The BP isolates from Tianjin showed close genetic relatedness to other Chinese strains, particularly those from Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Xinjiang. These strains shared identical alleles for 23 S rRNA-13 andprn-150, along with a consistent virulence gene profile (ptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1), suggesting a close evolutionary relationship among BP strains circulating in Tianjin and other regions of China during the same period. Notably, Tianjin BP isolates carrying theptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn-150(truncated)/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1profile formed a more tightly clustered subgroup. Additionally, several BP strains isolated in the past three years from Hebei Province and Shanghai, China, formed distinct branches phylogenetically distant from the majority of Chinese strains, due to differences in their 23 S rRNA or BPagST. For example, 11 strains isolated from Hebei Province possessed BPagST-37,prn-1and exhibited the virulence gene profileptxA-1/ptxC-1/ptxP-1/fim2-1/fim3-1.

The resurgence of BP infection has been extensively documented globally, posing a significant public health threat [5]. Fu et al. reported that the major BP genotypes in Shanghai from 2016 to 2022 wereptxA-1/ptxC-1/ptxP-1/prn-1/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-3(48.7%) andptxA-1/ptxC-2/ptxP-3/prn-2/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1(47.7%) [10]. Additionally, Zhou et al. identified strains exhibiting the antigenic configurationptxA-1/ptxC-2/ptxP-3/prn-150/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1in Beijing during 2022–2023 [6]. While molecular characteristics and epidemiology of BP have been reported in multiple regions across China in recent years [10,18,26,29], in-depth genomic characterization of BP strains in Tianjin remains lacking. In this study, the predominant genotype of BP isolates circulating in Tianjin was identified as ST2, characterized by the antigenic profile:ptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn-150(truncated)/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1(59.3%) andptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn-150/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1(40.7%), and no specific strain or recombinant signatures was detected through global phylogenetic analyses. Allprn-150(truncated)strains in our study exhibit IS481-mediated gene disruption—a mechanism identical to that reported by Zhou et al. [15]. These mutations correspond to validated molecular markers that have been shown to abrogate Prn production in multiple global studies [31–33], a critical component of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine, thereby potentially compromising the vaccine’s efficacy.

Although macrolides are the preferred treatment for pertussis and are utilized for prophylaxis [34], all 27 isolates from Tianjin exhibited 100% resistance to ERY, AZM, CLR, and the spread of macrolide-resistant strains internationally could have significant global public health impacts. Recent studies had also identifiedptxP-3strains in China that harbor mutations conferring macrolide resistance [14,23], and evidence indicated that macrolide-resistantptxP-3strains could effectively compete with existingptxP-3strains in these countries, especially during periods of epidemics when macrolide usage may be temporarily increased, underscoring the critical need for surveillance of macrolide-resistantptxP-3strains [11]. Among the 27 Tianjin isolates, 18.5% exhibited LEV resistance. While quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) mutations ingyrA,gyrB,parC, andparEgenes represent the primary LEV resistance mechanism in bacterium [35], genomic analysis revealed no such mutations in this study. This suggests potential non-QRDR mechanisms (e.g., efflux pumps, altered permeability, or regulatory networks) may contribute [36], warranting future transcriptomic/proteomic investigation. Given this study’s sample size limitations, further research is needed to elucidate the regulatory pathways linking genetic determinants to phenotypic resistance.

In conclusion, this study characterizes the phylogenetic relationships, genomic features, and antimicrobial resistance profiles of 27 BP isolates circulating in Tianjin during 2023. We identified two predominant virulence genotypes:ptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn-150(truncated)/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1andptxA-1/ptxC-4/ptxP-3/prn-150/fim2-1/fim3-1/fhaB-1. Phylogenetic analysis integrating 165 global BP genomes revealed high genomic homogeneity between Tianjin strains and globally circulating lineages. Correspondingly, antimicrobial susceptibility testing confirmed universal macrolide resistance among all isolates. This integrated approach establishes a pilot genomic surveillance framework that addresses a critical gap in regional data while complementing national surveillance systems. By providing region-specific genomic insights, it enhances the broader epidemiological landscape, enabling evidence-based public health interventions and informing vaccine development strategies through population-level pathogen genomics.
