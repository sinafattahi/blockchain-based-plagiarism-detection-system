Plyometric training (PT) is widely used to enhance physical fitness in youth team sport athletes, but its effects may vary across maturation stages due to developmental differences. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the impact of PT on multiple physical fitness outcomes across different maturation stages in youth male team sport athletes.

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus. Included studies were randomized controlled trials involving male youth team sport athletes (10–18 years) who underwent ≥ 4 weeks of bodyweight plyometric training compared to active controls, with outcomes related to physical fitness. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Effect sizes (Hedges’g) were calculated using a random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals and prediction intervals (PI). Egger’s test and the trim-and-fill method were used to assess and adjust for publication bias. Subgroup analyses explored training-related moderators.

A total of 36 studies were included, involving 663 soccer players, 230 basketball players, 54 handball players, and 110 volleyball players. PT significantly improved CMJ in the overall group (ES = 0.74, 95% PI [− 0.29 to 1.78]) and in PRE (ES = 0.83, 95% PI [− 0.93 to 2.58]), MID (ES = 0.50, 95% PI [0.27 to 0.73]), and POST (ES = 1.05, 95% PI [− 0.25 to 2.35]). SLJ improved in the overall group (ES = 0.52, 95% PI [0.30 to 0.74]), PRE (ES = 0.53, 95% PI [0.21 to 0.85]), and POST (ES = 0.87, 95% PI [− 1.06 to 2.81]), but not in MID (P > 0.05). ≤ 10 m sprint improved in the overall group (ES = − 0.58, 95% PI [− 1.45 to 0.30]), PRE (ES = − 0.43, 95% PI [− 0.85 to − 0.02]), and POST (ES = − 1.31, 95% PI [− 2.66 to 0.04]), but not in MID (P > 0.05). > 10 m sprint improved in all groups: overall (ES = − 0.41, 95% PI [− 0.91 to 0.09]), PRE (ES = − 0.28, 95% PI [− 0.54 to − 0.01]), MID (ES = − 0.32, 95% PI [− 0.57 to − 0.07]), and POST (ES = − 1.16, 95% PI [− 3.38 to 1.05]). COD improved in the overall group (ES = − 0.84, 95% PI [− 1.76 to 0.08]), PRE (ES = − 0.80, 95% PI [− 1.89 to 0.29]), MID (ES = − 0.59, 95% PI [− 1.01 to − 0.17]), and POST (ES = − 1.52, 95% PI [− 3.10 to 0.05]). PT showed no significant effect on maximal dynamic strength (P> 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed that ≥ 16 PT sessions led to greater improvements in CMJ (ES = 1.08 vs. 0.35) and COD (ES = − 1.05 vs. − 0.59) performance in the overall group, and in CMJ in the POST stage (ES = 1.64 vs. 0.54), compared to ≤ 14 sessions. CMJ gains were also greater with ≥ 8 week interventions than with ≤ 7 weeks (ES = 1.00 vs. 0.43).

PT effectively improves physical fitness in youth male team sport athletes, except for maximal dynamic strength. The greatest gains were observed in the POST stage, while the MID stage showed the smallest gains in jump and COD, with no significant effects observed for SLJ and ≤ 10 m sprint. The ranges of all prediction intervals suggest a higher likelihood of positive effects in future studies. Considering that some prediction intervals were relatively wide and crossed zero, further research is needed to better identify and manage the variability in training adaptations, particularly during the POST stage. Additionally, PT programs with at least 16 sessions or lasting 8 weeks appear to be more effective.

Team sports such as soccer, basketball, handball, and volleyball require athletes to frequently perform high-intensity actions such as jumping, sprinting, and change of direction (COD) during games. These actions demand highly developed physical fitness in youth athletes [1–3]. Explosive power, agility, and strength are crucial for athletes to score during competitions [4,5]. In basketball games, jumping occurs approximately once per minute, and athletes need to perform numerous sprints and high-intensity lateral movements [6,7]. Linear sprints and vertical jumps have been shown to be the most common actions preceding goals in soccer [5]. Furthermore, high levels of jumping, sprinting, and COD abilities have been proven to effectively distinguish elite athletes from non-elite athletes [8,9].

Plyometric training (PT) is widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing various physical performance attributes [10]. It typically involves exercises that use the stretch–shortening cycle (SSC), where a rapid concentric action follows an eccentric action [11]. This process leverages the natural elastic components of muscles and tendons, as well as the stretch reflex, to increase the power of subsequent movements [12]. The SSC enhances the neuromuscular and tendon systems’ ability to generate maximum force in the shortest time, making PT a bridge between strength and speed [13]. This training method is particularly beneficial for improving jumping ability [14], sprint speed [14], COD speed [15], and maximal strength [16], all of which are crucial for success in team sports. Additionally, research by Kons et al. [17] suggests that athletes in team sports might adapt better to PT due to the greater specificity of jumping tasks during training and competition. However, the impact of PT may vary depending on the maturation stage of youth athletes, as developmental stages influence their physiological adaptability to training [18].

For youth, maturation status may be a crucial factor influencing training response [19]. During the developmental process of adolescents, a series of biological changes occur, such as rapid increases in height, significant gains in lean body mass, and alterations in muscle–tendon structures [20,21]. These factors can affect the improvement of physical fitness following PT [22]. Additionally, when training strategies are combined with the natural developmental processes of physical fitness, this may provide more effective maturation-related training stimuli, thereby significantly enhancing training outcomes [23]. Therefore, considering the maturation status of adolescents is essential when designing their training programs.

Meta-analyses conducted by Moran et al. [19] and Asadi et al. [15] respectively examined the adaptations in countermovement jump (CMJ) and COD performance following PT in adolescent male athletes. Moran et al. [19] reported that both pre-peak height velocity (PHV) and post-PHV individuals showed significantly greater improvements in CMJ than those at mid-PHV, despite the latter group completing a higher training volume. In contrast, Asadi et al. [15] found that COD performance improved more substantially in the mid- and post-PHV groups, with relatively limited gains observed in the pre-PHV group. These findings suggest that the effects of PT on different physical fitness components may vary depending on maturation stages. It is worth noting that both studies inferred maturation stages based on chronological age rather than using direct assessments of biological maturation.

In contrast to the above, Ramirez-Campillo et al. [24] included only studies that assessed biological maturation using objective criteria such as PHV, thereby adopting a more biologically grounded methodological approach. However, due to the limited number of included studies, the analysis categorized participants only into pre-PHV and post-PHV groups, without further differentiation into a mid-PHV stage, which may have limited a more nuanced understanding of training responsiveness across different maturation stages. Their results also indicated that, compared to control groups, neither the pre- nor post-PHV cohorts showed significant improvements in CMJ. More recently, Chen et al. [25] also used a chronological age-based approach to classify maturation stages in their meta-analysis. However, their study focused exclusively on adaptations in vertical jump performance and 20-m sprint ability following PT, omitting other essential physical fitness outcomes and training variables.

Although these studies [15,19,24,25] have shed light on the adaptations to PT across different maturation stages in adolescents, most have focused on a limited range of physical fitness outcomes or lacked analyses of training-related variables. Furthermore, none of the studies reported prediction intervals, which limits the evaluation of the stability and generalizability of training effects in future applications [26,27]. Given the multifaceted physical demands placed on team sport athletes during competition, the present study aimed to provide a more comprehensive synthesis by examining the effects of PT on a broader spectrum of physical fitness attributes in adolescent male team sport athletes across different maturation stages.

This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews [28]. This study was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (No. 202470059). The registered document can be accessed using the following link:https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2024-7-0059/.

We conducted a systematic literature search across four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus). Studies published from inception until March 2025 were included. The search strategy involved using Boolean operators AND and OR with the following keywords: “plyometric”, “ballistic”, “stretch–shortening cycle”, “jump training”, “Youth”, “Young”, “Teen”, “Puberty”, “Maturation”, “Adolescent”, “Agility”, “direction”, “balance”, “Stability”, “velocity”, “Sprint”, “Jump”, “Explosive”, “Muscle”, “Power”, and “strength”. The results of the systematic literature search from the four databases were combined and duplicates were removed. After the removal of duplicates, two researchers screened the search results based on the inclusion criteria. The search strategy used in PubMed was as follows:((Agility OR Direction OR Balance OR Stability OR Velocity OR Sprint OR Jump OR Explosive OR Muscle OR Power OR Strength) AND (Plyometric OR Ballistic OR Stretch–Shortening Cycle OR Jump Training)) AND (Youth OR Young OR Teen OR Puberty OR Maturation OR Adolescent). In addition, we screened the reference lists of both previous meta-analyses and the articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The studies were screened using the PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study design) method [29]. Table1lists the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The additional inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) experimental trials published in peer-reviewed English-language journals, providing full-text access; (2) In studies with multiple groups (e.g., plyometric only, plyometric + strength, control), only the plyometric-only and control groups were considered, provided the plyometric training met inclusion criteria.

Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) was used to extract the means and standard deviations of the dependent variables before and after the intervention from the included studies. The first author extracted the physical fitness indicators such as jumps (e.g., CMJ), linear sprints (e.g., 10 m, 20 m), COD ability (e.g., Illinois test), and strength (e.g., 1 repetition maximum half-squat) from the included studies as dependent variables. Additionally, subject health status, sex, sample size, sport, years of practice, and intervention descriptions (exercise type, intensity, duration, and frequency) were extracted. The second author checked the accuracy and completeness of the extracted data. Moreover, age groupings previously used by researchers [15,19] (10–12.99 years = pre-peak height velocity [PRE], 13–15.99 years = mid-peak height velocity [MID], 16–18 years = post-peak height velocity [POST]) were used to estimate the possible maturation status of participants in each study.

The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies [30]. The quality assessment was interpreted using the following 10-point scale: a score of ≤ 3 was considered to indicate poor quality, 4–5 indicated fair quality, and 6–10 indicated high quality. The PEDro scale consists of 11 items designed to evaluate methodological quality. Each satisfied item contributes 1 point to the overall PEDro score (range 0–10 points). Item 1 was not included in the quality rating of the studies as it pertains to external validity. The methodological quality of each included study was assessed independently by two authors (GL and RY), and any discrepancies between the two authors were resolved via consensus with a third author (JC).

Data analyses were conducted using the meta and metafor packages in R version 4.4.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing). The pre- and post-training means and standard deviations (SD) for each dependent variable were used to calculate the effect sizes (ES; Hedges’ g) for each physical fitness indicator in both the PT and control groups. A random-effects model was employed to account for variability between studies that might affect the PT effects [31,32]. ES values were expressed with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The calculated ES were interpreted using the following scale: trivial: < 0.2; small: 0.2–0.6; moderate: > 0.6–1.2; large: > 1.2–2.0; very large: > 2.0–4.0; and extremely large: > 4.0 [33]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, with values of < 25%, 25%-75%, and > 75% representing low, moderate, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively [34]. The extended Egger’s test was used to explore the risk of bias [35]. In cases of bias, the trim and fill method was applied for adjustments [36]. Statistical significance was set atp≤ 0.05.

Subgroup analyses were performed using median split techniques to divide moderator variables (frequency, training duration, and total sessions). The median was calculated when at least three studies provided data for the moderator variable. Additionally, to minimize heterogeneity, the median was calculated for specific age groups and outcome indicators.

The search process identified 16,058 studies (5272 from PubMed, 5399 from Scopus, 4042 from Web of Science, and 1345 from SPORTDiscus), resulting in a total of 8,687 studies after removing duplicates. Ultimately, 36 studies were included in this meta-analysis [12,37–71]. Figure1illustrates the study selection process. Table2displays the characteristics of participants in the included studies.

Using the PEDro checklist, 7 studies were considered to be of moderate quality (4–5 points), and the remaining 29 studies were considered to be of high quality (6–10 points) [Supplementary Table S1].

The overall effects of PT on physical fitness are shown in Table3. The forest plots are shown in Figs.2,3,4,5,6and7.

Meta-analysis results showed that PT had significant small-to-moderates effect on improving both CMJ height and SLJ distance in the overall age group: CMJ (ES = 0.74, 95% CI [0.51 to 0.97],P< 0.001), SLJ (ES = 0.52, 95% CI [0.31 to 0.73],P< 0.001).

At different maturation stages, CMJ height improved significantly with small-to-moderate effects: PRE (ES = 0.83, 95% CI [0.32 to 1.34],P= 0.001), MID (ES = 0.50, 95% CI [0.29 to 0.71],P< 0.001), POST (ES = 1.05, 95% CI [0.55 to 1.54],P< 0.001). SLJ distance also improved significantly in the PRE and POST stages with small-to-moderate effects: PRE (ES = 0.53, 95% CI [0.26 to 0.80],P< 0.001), POST (ES = 0.87, 95% CI [0.19 to 1.56],P= 0.012). Although no significant improvement was observed in the MID stage, a small effect was still evident (ES = 0.27, 95% CI [− 0.18 to 0.71], P = 0.235). The POST and MID stages showed the largest and smallest improvements, respectively.

However, the PIs for CMJ improvements in the overall age group [− 0.29 to 1.78], PRE [− 0.93 to 2.58] and POST [− 0.25 to 2.35] stages, and for SLJ improvements in the MID [–0.36 to 0.90] and POST [− 1.06 to 2.81] stages, all crossed zero, suggesting that future studies may report no difference or negative effects. In contrast, the PI for CMJ in the MID [0.27 to 0.73] stage and for SLJ in the overall age group [0.30 to 0.74] and PRE [0.21 to 0.85] stage were entirely above zero, indicating a higher likelihood of stable and consistent positive effects in future studies. (Figs.2and3).

Meta-analysis results showed that PT had significant small effects on improving both ≤ 10 m and > 10 m sprint performance in the overall age group: ≤ 10 m sprint (ES = − 0.58, 95% CI [− 0.87 to − 0.29],P< 0.001), > 10 m sprint (ES = − 0.41, 95% CI [− 0.58 to − 0.23],P< 0.001).

At different maturation stages, ≤ 10 m sprint performance improved significantly with small-to-large effects: PRE (ES = − 0.43, 95% CI [− 0.75 to − 0.12],P= 0.007), POST (ES = − 1.31, 95% CI [− 1.93 to − 0.69],P< 0.001). Although no significant improvement was observed in the MID stage, a small effect was still evident (ES = − 0.48, 95% CI [− 1.05 to 0.08],P= 0.092). > 10 m sprint performance also improved significantly across all three maturation stages with small-to-moderate effects: PRE (ES = − 0.28, 95% CI [− 0.51 to − 0.04],P= 0.024), MID (ES = − 0.32, 95% CI [− 0.54 to –0.09],P= 0.006), POST (ES = − 1.16, 95% CI [–1.92 to − 0.41],P= 0.003). The POST stage showed the greatest improvements in both sprint distances.

However, the PIs for ≤ 10 m sprint improvements in the overall age group [− 1.45 to 0.30], MID [− 2.10 to 1.13] and POST [− 2.66 to 0.04] stages, and for > 10 m sprint in the overall age group [− 0.91 to 0.09] and POST [− 3.38 to 1.05] stage, all crossed zero, suggesting that future studies may report no difference or negative effects. In contrast, the PI for ≤ 10 m sprint in the PRE [− 0.85 to − 0.02] stage, and for > 10 m sprint in the PRE [− 0.54 to − 0.01] and MID [− 0.57 to − 0.07] stages were entirely below zero, indicating a higher likelihood of stable and consistent improvements in sprint performance across future studies. (Figs.4and5).

Meta-analysis results showed that PT had a significant moderate effect on improving COD performance in the overall age group (ES = − 0.84, 95% CI [− 1.08 to − 0.60],P< 0.001).

At different maturation stages, COD performance improved significantly with small-to-large effects: PRE (ES = − 0.80, 95% CI [− 1.18 to –0.41],P< 0.001), MID (ES = − 0.59, 95% CI [− 0.85 to − 0.33],P< 0.001), and POST (ES = − 1.52, 95% CI [− 2.14 to − 0.91],P< 0.001). The POST and MID stages showed the largest and smallest improvements, respectively.

However, the PIs for COD improvements in the overall age group [–1.76 to 0.08], PRE [− 1.89 to 0.29] and POST [− 3.10 to 0.05] stages crossed zero, suggesting that future studies may report no difference or negative effects. In contrast, the PI for the MID [− 1.01 to − 0.17] stage was entirely below zero, indicating a higher likelihood of stable and consistent improvements in COD performance in future studies. (Fig.6).

Meta-analysis results showed no significant improvements in maximal dynamic strength in the overall age group (ES = 0.41, 95% CI [− 0.05 to 0.86], 95% PI [− 1.05 to 1.86],P= 0.079), as well as in the PRE (ES = 0.62, 95% CI [− 0.53 to 1.78], 95% PI [− 3.37 to 4.61],P= 0.290) and MID (ES = 0.25, 95% CI [–0.05 to 0.55], 95% PI [− 0.18 to 0.67],P= 0.106) stages. All PIs crossed zero, suggesting that future studies may report no difference or negative effects. (Fig.7).

When the total number of training sessions was ≥ 16, the overall age group showed significantly greater improvements in CMJ height [ES = 1.08 vs. 0.35,P< 0.001] and COD performance [ES = − 1.05 vs. − 0.59,P= 0.044] compared to those with ≤ 14 sessions. The POST stage also showed significantly greater improvement in CMJ height when the number of sessions was ≥ 16 [ES = 1.64 vs. 0.54,P= 0.011].

In addition, when the training duration was ≥ 8 weeks, the overall age group exhibited significantly greater improvements in CMJ height [ES = 1.00 vs. 0.43,P= 0.008] compared to durations of ≤ 7 weeks. The results of the subgroup analyses are presented in Table4.

The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of plyometric training on the physical fitness of male youth team sport athletes across different maturation stages (PRE, MID, and POST). The main findings indicate that PT significantly improved CMJ, SLJ, ≤ 10 m sprint, > 10 m sprint, and COD performance in the overall age group, compared to the control group, while showing no significant effect on maximal dynamic strength. Across maturation stages, the POST stage exhibited the greatest improvements in jump, sprint, and COD performance. In contrast, the MID stage showed the smallest gains in jump and COD, with no significant effects observed for SLJ and ≤ 10 m sprint. The ranges of all prediction intervals suggest a higher probability of positive rather than negative effects, indicating that PT is likely to yield beneficial outcomes in future similar studies.

Compared with the control group, PT led to significant small-to-moderate improvements in CMJ height in the overall group (ES = 0.74), as well as in the PRE (ES = 0.83), MID (ES = 0.50), and POST (ES = 1.05) stages. For SLJ distance, significant small-to-moderate improvements were found in the overall group (ES = 0.52), PRE (ES = 0.53), and POST (ES = 0.87) stages, with a small but non-significant effect in the MID (ES = 0.27) stage. The greatest and smallest improvements in both CMJ and SLJ were observed in the POST and MID stages, respectively. For the PIs, CMJ in the MID stage and SLJ in the PRE stage and overall group had PIs entirely above zero. In the remaining groups, the range of the PIs indicated a greater likelihood of positive rather than negative effects, suggesting that PT is more likely to yield beneficial outcomes in future similar studies.

The effectiveness of PT in enhancing CMJ performance in youth athletes is consistent with previous meta-analyses [19]. The improvements in jump performance after PT may be attributed to various adaptive mechanisms, such as enhanced neural drive to the active muscles, improved SSC utilization, better intermuscular coordination, and changes in muscle structure [10].

Specifically, among different maturation stages, youth in the PRE stage have greater tendon compliance [72,73]. More compliant muscle–tendon units can store and release more elastic energy, enhancing SSC performance [10]. Additionally, PT not only induces favorable neuromuscular adaptations [10] but also promotes adaptations in bone [74] and muscle–tendon units [75,76]. The combined effect of these training adaptations and natural development contributes to improved jump performance. For CMJ, the PI in the PRE stage ranged from –0.93 to 2.58. Although the probability of a positive effect appears higher, the wide interval crossing zero suggests that future research and practical applications should be approached with caution. By contrast, the entirely positive PI for SLJ supports greater confidence in its improvement.

However, the improvements in jump performance during the MID stage are not as ideal as in other stages. This may be due to this period being the fastest growth phase for males [77], with different growth spurts in trunk and leg lengths [78]. The legs reach peak growth velocity before peak height velocity, while the trunk reaches peak growth velocity subsequently [20], leading to a higher center of gravity [79]. Additionally, rapid weight gain [79] and the inability of neural pathways to quickly adapt to substantial changes in body size [80] complicate the control of the trunk during PT in youth [81], thereby affecting training benefits. Although the improvement in CMJ was relatively small in the MID stage, the PI was narrow and entirely above zero, indicating that future training is more likely to yield positive outcomes.

In the POST stage, PT shows the most noticeable improvement in jump performance among the three age groups. By this time, the "adolescent awkwardness" phenomenon diminishes, muscle mass and circulating hormone concentrations increase [82], and the central nervous system matures, enhancing motor unit recruitment and neuromuscular coordination [83]. Furthermore, with age, muscle activation strategies shift from reactive, protective inhibition to preparatory, performance-enhancing excitation [84]. These factors contribute to maximizing PT benefits in the POST stage. It is worth noting that although the POST stage showed the most pronounced improvements in jump performance, the PIs were relatively wide and crossed zero. In addition, we found that the improvement in SLJ became non-significant after applying the trim-and-fill method, which may be attributed to the fact that among the three included studies [37,62,71], only one incorporated horizontal jump training in its PT protocol [62]. Future research and practical applications should place greater emphasis on identifying and managing variability in training adaptations during this stage.

Further subgroup analyses showed that when the total number of training sessions was ≥ 16, the improvement in CMJ height was significantly greater in both the overall age group and the POST stage compared to ≤ 14 sessions. In addition, when the training duration was ≥ 8 weeks, the overall age group showed significantly greater improvement in CMJ height compared to durations of ≤ 7 weeks.This may be because higher training volumes provide athletes with sufficient time and opportunity to adapt and strengthen muscle and neural responses [85]. Continuous training allows athletes to better master and apply PT techniques, resulting in significant improvements in CMJ performance.

Regarding practical application, trainers should adjust the intensity and type of PT based on the maturation stage of youth athletes to maximize training effects. Particularly during the MID stage, focusing on coordination training can help athletes navigate this "awkward period" and lay the foundation for improved power performance in later stages. Additionally, appropriately increasing the total sessions of PT can strengthen the muscle and nervous system and enhance adaptation to PT.

Compared with the control group, PT led to significant small-to-large improvements in ≤ 10 m sprint performance in the overall group (ES = − 0.58), as well as in the PRE (ES = − 0.43) and POST (ES = − 1.31) stages, with a small but non-significant effect observed in the MID (ES = − 0.48) stage. For > 10 m sprint performance, significant small-to-moderate improvements were found in the overall group (ES = − 0.41), PRE (ES = − 0.28), MID (ES = − 0.32), and POST (ES = − 1.16) stages. Both ≤ 10 m and > 10 m sprints improved most in the POST stage. For the PIs, the PI for ≤ 10 m sprint in the PRE stage and those for > 10 m sprint in the PRE and MID stages were entirely below zero. In the remaining groups, the range of the PIs suggested a greater likelihood of positive rather than negative effects, implying that PT is more likely to produce favorable sprint outcomes in future similar studies.

Sprint performance is the product of stride rate and stride length [37], and PT can improve both stride frequency and stride length [86,87]. The enhanced sprint performance following PT is likely due to increased neuromuscular activation of the muscles, including increased discharge frequency of active motor units and changes in their recruitment patterns [88].

Younger youth exhibit more inhibitory mechanisms and lower neuromuscular efficiency compared to older youth [89]. They activate higher levels of antagonistic muscles immediately after ground contact [90] and have lower stretch reflex responses than adults [73,91], a phenomenon more pronounced in the PRE stage. Additionally, the premotor cortex cannot accurately maintain postural control and adapt to rapid corrections during SSC movements by controlling the appropriate motor units [92]. Despite the small effects observed in the PRE stage, the relatively narrow and entirely negative PIs for both ≤ 10 m and > 10 m sprints suggest a reliable potential for performance enhancement.

As leg and vertical stiffness increase with maturation, eccentric and concentric contact times may decrease [93]. Reduced ground contact time requires a higher rate of force development and more efficient reuse of elastic energy to maintain the center of mass displacement [92]. Although the ability to utilize and generate power develops throughout an athlete’s maturation, the power generation in MID adolescents is still not high enough [92]. These complex interactions likely result in less ideal sprint performance improvements in the MID stage compared to the POST stage. For ≤ 10 m sprints, the abilities related to horizontal force and postural control are particularly important during the acceleration phase [94], and the poorer trunk control in MID adolescents [80] may explain the lack of significant improvements in ≤ 10 m sprint performance after PT. By contrast, the PI for > 10 m sprint performance in the MID stage was relatively narrow and entirely below zero, suggesting a stable and consistent likelihood of improvement in future similar studies.

Maturation plays a crucial role in energy storage and utilization and in the development of SSC at maximum sprint speed [93]. With age, increases in testosterone, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 contribute to the accumulation of lean mass and the relative reduction of body fat. By age 18, most males have attained 90% of their final total skeletal mass [95]. This increase in strength is associated with faster sprint performance in adolescents [96]. Additionally, sprint performance naturally develops due to increased muscle size, limb length, changes in tendon tissue, enhanced neural and motor development, and better movement quality and coordination [97]. While positive sprint outcomes appear more likely in the POST stage, the limited number of studies and the wide PIs crossing zero underscore the need for future research and practical applications to focus on identifying and managing variability in training adaptations during this stage.

Compared with the control group, PT led to significant small-to-large improvements in COD performance in the overall group (ES = − 0.84), as well as in the PRE (ES = − 0.80), MID (ES = − 0.59), and POST (ES = − 1.52) stages. The greatest and smallest improvements were observed in the POST and MID stages, respectively. For the PIs, the PI for the MID stage was entirely below zero. In the remaining groups, the range of the PIs suggested a greater likelihood of positive rather than negative effects, supporting the expectation that PT is likely to enhance COD performance in future similar studies. Although Asadi et al. [15] concluded that COD improvements in youth increased with maturation stage, our meta-analysis based on a larger sample size revealed a different trend. Subgroup analysis revealed that COD performance improved significantly more in the overall age group when the total number of training sessions was ≥ 16 compared to ≤ 14.

The potential mechanisms underlying COD improvements after PT are likely related to neuromuscular adaptations, such as enhanced motor unit recruitment and discharge frequency [22,98]. Specifically, improvements in COD require rapid force development, eccentric strength of the thigh muscles, and quick transitions of the leg extensors from eccentric to concentric muscle actions, which PT seems to enhance [99,100].

In different maturation stages, improvements in COD performance during the PRE stage may be primarily due to factors such as increased motor unit activation, faster contraction velocity, enhanced pre-activation, and greater reliance on short-latency stretch reflexes, leading to more feedforward SSC function [22]. Although strength development is slower in the PRE stage [83], better motor unit recruitment or neural adaptations following PT can improve COD performance [22]. At the same time, the PI for the PRE stage (-1.89 to 0.29) suggests a greater likelihood of positive effects in future studies, although caution is warranted due to the potential for negative outcomes.

Effective translation of PT into COD performance might require a certain level of motor coordination, as PT can be technically challenging for younger athletes [101]. Additionally, Young et al. [102] suggested that COD performance might be more influenced by motor control factors such as skill and coordination than by strength or power. In the MID stage, the weaker trend in COD improvements compared to other stages might be due to rapid lengthening of the trunk and limbs, sudden weight gain, and changes in the center of gravity [78,79], all of which can lead to a decline in coordination related to physical development [103], thereby interfering with training adaptations [101]. Specific sensorimotor mechanisms may also degrade during rapid adolescent growth, such as neuromuscular control, postural stability, and inter-limb/segmental coordination [80]. Nevertheless, the PI range for the MID stage (-1.01 to -0.17) suggests that coaches can remain confident in the effectiveness of PT in enhancing COD performance during this maturation stage.

In the POST stage, athletes typically exhibit greater strength as a result of natural physiological development, including increased muscle mass, elevated testosterone levels, and enhanced motor control due to maturation processes [104–106]. These growth-related increases in strength are closely associated with faster sprint performance in youth [96], and short-distance sprint speed is in turn strongly linked to COD ability [107]. In addition to these biological factors, PT can enhance the eccentric strength of the thigh muscles, which is crucial for deceleration during impulsive movements [99]. This enhanced eccentric strength facilitates rapid transitions of the leg extensors from eccentric to concentric muscle actions, promoting changes in direction [15]. PT can also positively impact COD performance by reducing ground reaction time through increased muscle power output and movement efficiency [108]. Therefore, the improvement in COD performance during the POST stage likely reflects the combined influence of natural growth-related strength development and training-induced neuromuscular adaptations. Similar to the improvements observed in jump and sprint performance during the POST stage, the PI for COD enhancement was also relatively wide, indicating that future research should further identify and manage the variability in training adaptations at this stage.

Meta-analysis results showed no significant improvement in maximal dynamic strength following PT. This is inconsistent with previous meta-analyses [24], which might be attributed to the absence of studies on the POST stage in this research, as accelerated strength gains occur during the POST stage [82]. Based on the PIs, the MID stage showed a higher likelihood of positive effects than the PRE stage, suggesting that youth athletes may be more likely to experience beneficial strength gains as maturation progresses.

Muscle hypertrophy can enhance muscle strength [109]. Older adolescents may exhibit greater muscle plasticity after PT, including increases in muscle size, a shift from type I to type II muscle fibers, changes in muscle pennation angle, enhanced muscle contraction capabilities, improved motor unit recruitment, and increased neural drive to the active muscles [10]. In contrast, younger male adolescents have lower hormone levels, which are less conducive to muscle mass increase [110].

It is noteworthy that the meta-analysis by Oliver et al. indicated that combined plyometric and strength training is about three times more effective in improving lower body strength compared to PT alone, highlighting the impact of training specificity [111]. Integrating this combined training approach into the development of high-level, well-trained youth athletes appears to be more desirable.

Compared to the control group, PT improved CMJ, SLJ, ≤ 10 m sprint, > 10 m sprint, and COD performance in the overall age group of male youth team sport athletes, while showing no significant effect on maximal dynamic strength. Across maturation stages, the POST stage exhibited the greatest improvements in jump, sprint, and COD performance. In contrast, the MID stage showed the smallest gains in jump and COD, with no significant effects observed for SLJ and ≤ 10 m sprint. The ranges of all prediction intervals suggest a higher probability of positive rather than negative effects, indicating that PT is more likely to yield beneficial outcomes in future similar studies. Considering that some prediction intervals were relatively wide and crossed zero, further research is needed to better identify and manage the variability in training adaptations, particularly during the POST stage. Additionally, PT with ≥ 16 sessions or lasting ≥ 8 weeks may be a more effective strategy for optimizing training outcomes.
