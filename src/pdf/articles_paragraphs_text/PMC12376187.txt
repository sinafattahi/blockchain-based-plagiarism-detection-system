The evolution of
interstellar ices can be studied with
thermal
tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO2ice that show
great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment.
Now with the wide spectral coverage and sensitivity of the James Webb
Space Telescope we can obtain observations of the weak and strong
CO2absorption features inhabiting the near- and mid-infrared
spectral region. In this work we present observations of the 15.2
μm bending mode, the 4.39 μm stretching mode and the 2.70
μm combination mode of12CO2and13CO2ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126
and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35, two sources that show clear
signs of ice heating. The 15.2 μm bending mode of both protostars
shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with
pure CO2ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed
at 4.38 μm in the13CO2bands of the two
sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected
at 2.69 μm in the12CO2combination mode
of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all
three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands
can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO2ice in mixtures with mostly CH3OH and H2O
ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings
show that upon heating, CO2ice is likely segregating from
mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO2–CH3OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes.
Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO2components with respect to the total absorption band is similar
for both12CO2and13CO2. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant
role during the different formation epochs, H2O-dominated
and CO-dominated, of the CO2ices and that the ratio persists
through the heating stage. We quantify the12CO2and13CO2ice column densities and derive12C/13Cice= 90 ±
9 in IRAS 20126, a value that is lower compared to what was previously
reported for warm gaseous CO in this source. Finally, we report the
detection of the13CO2bending mode of pure
CO2ice at 15.64 μm in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb
35.

The formation of an infant star in a collapsing
dark molecular
cloud marks the beginning of the protostellar stage. These stellar
cradles are also the formation sites of interstellar ices where the
low temperatures and higher densities enable atoms and small molecules
to stick to the surfaces of cold dust grains. These small species
subsequently react to create the molecules that later evolve and become
the prebiotic material that is incorporated into planets. Consequently, it is imperative to study the chemical
journey of interstellar ices in order to define the initial conditions
that could potentially lead to habitability. One process that can
significantly alter the structure and composition of interstellar
ices is heating by the central protostar.−This thermal processing also alters the infrared
absorption features of these ices, a well-known example being the
crystalline profile of water ice, and
these ice absorption bands can therefore act as probes when examining
physicochemical processes.

The era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides
new and
unique opportunities to study the vibrational modes of CO2ice at higher S/N in high-mass and solar-mass protostars. In particular,
its exceptional sensitivity enables observations of weak features
such as the 2.70 μm12CO2combination
mode and the 4.39 μm13CO2stretching
mode. These weaker bands have the additional advantage of being unsusceptible
to the grain shape and size effects that can further alter the band
profiles.−Finally, the wide spectral coverage of the JWST allows
access to the strong12CO24.27 μm stretching
mode and 15.2 μm bending mode,enabling a
complete study of all the CO2ice absorption features.

In this work we use JWST observations to investigate the environment
of CO2ice in the low-mass-protostar Per-emb 35 and the
high mass protostar IRAS 20126 + 4104 (hereafter IRAS 20126) as part
of the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program−and the Investigating Protostellar Accretion Across the Mass Spectrum
(IPA) program.−Both sources show spectral signatures of thermally
processed ices. We perform for the first time a consistent profile
decomposition of three12CO2bands: the12CO2ν2bending mode (15.2 μm),
the13CO2ν3stretching mode
(4.39 μm) and the ν1+ ν3combination
mode (2.70 μm). This paper is structured as follows. In theObservations and Methods section, we present our
observations and provide the methods used for the profile analysis.
In theAnalysis section, we present the spectral
decompositions. The results are discussed in theDiscussion section, and the main points of this work are summarized
in theConclusions section.

whereFλis the observed flux
andFλis the flux of the continuum. Further details
on the continuum placement and the anchor points used in each spectral
region are described with supporting figures in Brunken et al.

The continuum in the 15 μm region
was subtracted by first fitting a global continuum following the methods
presented in Boogert et al., Poteet et
al. After subtracting the continuum and
converting the spectra to optical depth scale, we fitted the silicate
template of GCS 3 to the 9.7 and 18 μm silicate features and
subtracted this from the spectra. The
line of sight of GCS 3 passes through a large column density of a
diffuse cloud containing silicates but little ices. Following the
silicate subtraction we fitted laboratory data of water ice at various
temperatures to subtract the water libration
mode at 12.6 μm from the spectrum of Per-emb 35. The continuum
subtraction and water libration mode subtraction for Per-emb 35 are
presented in Figures 7 and 8 in theSupporting Informationsection.

The spectrum of IRAS 20126 proved
to be more difficult to fit with
the water laboratory data currently available to us and we opted instead
to fit a local continuum over the CO215.2 μm band
to simulate the wing of the water libration mode and subtracted this
from the spectrum. We note that this method of simulating the overlapping
spectral features in this region with local continua and Gaussian
curves is similar to the methods applied in Gerakines et al. and Pontoppidan et al. The final spectra of IRAS 20126 are shown on optical depth scale
inSupporting Figure 9. The uncertainty
on the continuum placement can account for up to 20% in the error
budget.

The spectral decompositions
of the 2.70 μm, the 4.39 μm and the 15.2 μm bands
of CO2were performed using laboratory spectra. The laboratory
data,,that provided
the best fit are presented inTableand are publicly available on the Leiden Ice Data
Base (LIDA).

The bands were fitted using a χ2minimization
routine that provides the best linear combination of five components
each representative of CO2in a specific chemical environment. The best fit was selected based on the lowest
χ2value and for the components we used laboratory
spectra of the binary ices CO2:H2O, CO2:CH3OH, CO2:CO and pure CO2ice.
Given the number of mixing ratios available for each binary ice, we
opted to use the mixing ratios determined in previous CO2studies,as a starting point and introduced new mixing
ratios when necessary. As input spectra for the χ2minimization routine, we used all available temperature measurements
for a given mixing ratio.

The 15.2 μm band of IRAS 20126
was first fitted with the
linear combination that Brunken et al. used to fit the13CO24.39 μm band in
this source. If this initial linear combination failed to reproduce
the 15.2 μm band, the 4.39 μm band was refitted with
a combination of different laboratory spectra. For example, a new
mixing ratio could be introduced before running the χ2routine to find a new best fit for the 4.39 μm feature. The
4.39 μm band analysis was revisited because the components are
better isolated and therefore more distinguishable in this vibrational
mode compared to the 15.2 μm bending mode.

Once a new
best fit was found for the 4.39 μm band, we ran
the χ2routine with all the available temperatures
of this new mixing ratio on the 15.2 μm band to test whether
the routine would select the same spectra to fit this feature. If
the band was instead fitted with a different linear combination, we
used the selected five spectra to fit the at 4.39 μm and test
if this combination could also reproduce the13CO2feature. If a spectrum in this combination failed to reproduce the
4.39 μm band, it was removed from the list of input spectra,
and we ran the χ2routine again on the 15 μm
band with the remaining input spectra. This process was repeated until
consistent results were found between the bands, after which the 2.70
μm band was included in the analysis. The routine provides 1σ
uncertainties on each fitted component. This is a margin for how much
the contribution of each component can be increased or decreased before
the band profile is no longer reproduced by the linear combination.
This multiband analysis allowed us to provide additional constraints
on the components and lower some of the degeneracies between the laboratory
spectra. Further details on the fitting of our sources are presented
in theAnalysis section.

is the integrated optical depth under the absorption feature, andAis the corresponding band strength of the vibrational
mode. For the band strength we used the values determined by Gerakines
et al. and corrected by Bouilloud et
al. The corrected band strengths used
in this work are presentedTable. In order to facilitate comparison with studies that
do not use the corrected band strengths, we have included the correction
factors that can be used to convert the column densities. The column
densities derived in this work need to be multiplied with these correction
factors in order to compare them with column densities derived using
the uncorrected band strengths.

The corrected values

et al.,were taken from Bouilloud et al. The column densities derived in this work can
be multiplied by the correction factors to compare them with values
derived using the band strengths reported in Gerakines et al. and Gerakines et al.

In the
following sections we present the profile
analysis of the12CO2ν2bending
mode (15.2 μm),
the13CO2ν3stretching mode
(4.39 μm) and the12CO2ν1+ ν3combination mode (2.70 μm). The strong12CO2ν3stretching mode at 4.27
μm is observed in both sources but is saturated (τ >
5).
Its true optical depth therefore remains uncertain. Furthermore, its
profile is highly sensitive to grain shape and size effects.,Consequently, we opted to exclude this band from this analysis.
We also report the detection of a weak feature at 15.64 μm which
we assign to the bending mode of13CO2ice.

InFigurewe present the profile analysis
of the 4.39 μm band of13CO2and the 15.2
μm band of12CO2in the high-mass source
IRAS 20126. Currently there are no NIRSpec G235 M observations of
this source and the 2.70 μm combination mode is therefore not
available.

1:2 25 K and CO2:CO 1:1 15 K component, respectively. Finally
the green line shows the sum of all the components. The poor fit at
16.2 and 16.5 μm is likely due to absorption features of crystalline
silicates.

The13CO2feature of IRAS
20126 was first
modeled by Brunken et al., who performed
a phenomenological decomposition of the ice feature and identified
the peak positions and widths of three main components: a short-wavelength
peak, a long-wavelength peak and a middle component (Supporting Table 7). The band was subsequently fitted with
a linear combination of five laboratory spectra based on the study
by Pontoppidan et al. of the 15.2 μm
bending mode. The components are representative of CO2ice
in the following environments: pure CO2ice, CO2in an H2O-rich environment, CO2mixed with
CH3OH, CO2diluted in CO and CO2mixed
with CO in equal ratios. Brunken et al. compared the width and central positions of the short-wavelength,
long-wavelength and middle component of the 4.39 μm band (Supporting Table 7) with those of various laboratory
spectra and selected five laboratory spectra to fit this absorption
band: CO2:H2O 1:10 10 K, CO2:CH3OH 1:10 10 K, CO2:CO 1:1 15 K, CO2:CO
1:2 25 K and pure CO280 K. For further details on this
selection process, we refer the reader to Brunken et al.

InFigurewe present
an extended version ofFigurefrom Brunken et al. showing
the evolution of the full width at half-maximum (FHWM) and central
positions of the available CO2laboratory spectra for the
4.39 μm band of13CO2. The widths and
peak positions of the long-wavelength, short-wavelength and middle
components measured for the13CO2band in IRAS
20126 are also shown.

is affecting both the width and central position of these ice bands.
The width and central positions measured for the long-wavelength,
short-wavelength and middle components of the13CO2band are shown as colored stars.

The 15.2 μm bending mode of IRAS 20126 was
initially modeled
using the same combination of laboratory spectra selected by Brunken
et al. as a starting point. Given the
susceptibility of the 15.2 μm band to grain shape and size effects,
we applied a CDE correction on the laboratory spectrum of pure CO2prior to the fitting. This five-component linear combination
failed to reproduce the 15.2 μm absorption band however because
the laboratory spectrum of CO2:CH3OH 1:10 at
10 K is too red-shifted to fit the shoulder located at 15.4 μm.
Laboratory spectra of CO2:CH3OH 1:10 ices at
higher temperatures also failed to reproduce this shoulder. Brunken
et al. also provided an alternative three-component
linear combination of solely heated ices but this failed to reproduce
the 15.2 μm ice band as well.

Consequently, we revisited
the profile analysis of the13CO24.39 μm
band. The width and central position
of the long-wavelength feature seen in the13CO2band (Table 7) were compared to laboratory
spectra of various CO2:CH3OH ices and the results
indicate that the 1:1 mixing ratio produces bands with properties
that coincide with this peak (Figure). The CO2:CH3OH 1:10 laboratory
spectra were then exchanged in favor of the 1:1 spectra and we ran
the χ2fitting routine with these new input spectra
as described in theObservations and Methods section. Our findings show that the band profiles of both vibrational modes
are successfully reproduced with the CO2:CH3OH 1:1 spectrum at 115 K as shown inFigure.

While the CO2:H2O 1:10 at 10 K successfully
fitted both vibrational modes, the possibility of a warm CO2:H2O component was also considered given that both the
15.4 μm shoulder and the 4.39 μm peak are better fitted
with high-temperature CO2:CH3OH spectra. Ice
heating causes the CO2:H2O 1:10 spectra to shift
to significantly longer wavelengths however (Figure) and these spectra no longer fit the13CO2band in a five-component linear combination.
Therefore, we opted to run the χ2routine with spectra
of CO2:H2O ices in different mixing ratios.
Given the limited available laboratory data, we selected the CO2:H2O 1:1 mixture; the abundance of CO2with respect to H2O is ∼20–50% in the protostellar
envelopes.

Figureshows that
the band profiles of both the13CO24.39 μm
and the12CO215.2 μm bands are successfully
fitted with high-temperature spectra of this 1:1 mixing ratio. TheSupporting Figure 10shows the alternative fit
with the cold CO2:H2O 1:10 spectrum at 10 K.
It is clear that there is a degeneracy between these CO2:H2O laboratory spectra. In theDiscussion
sectionwe will argue however why the high-temperature water
spectra are better suited for the analysis of the ices in IRAS 20126
and Per-emb 35.

InTablewe present
the fraction of each component with respect to the total integrated
optical depth including their 1σ uncertainties. The fraction
of integrated optical depth is consistent between the two bands within
these uncertainties. The χ2for the 4.39 and 15.2
μm bands are 2.8 and 3.0, respectively. It is worth noting that
the contribution of these components remains the same when the CO2:H2O 1:1 100 K spectrum is exchanged for the 1:10
mixture at 10 K.

Finally,Figureshows that the long-wavelength
wing of the bending
mode is poorly
fitted above 15.8 μm. In particular, there are two notable features
at 16.2 and 16.5 μm that we were unable to reproduce with the
laboratory data. These could be absorption features of crystalline
silicates such as fosterite and enstatite. Additional evidence of
these crystalline silicates was found at longer wavelengths with detections
of the characteristic absorption band of crystalline forsterite at
23.2 μm but these features could
also be present at shorter wavelengths. Removing these bands however
requires a careful modeling of all the silicates features spanning
the 9–27 μm spectral region and this is beyond the scope
of this paper.

After
successfully fitting
the two absorption features of IRAS 20126, we applied the linear combination
to the ice absorption bands of the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35.
This source is particularly interesting to study because the12CO2combination mode located at 2.70 μm
is observed with the NIRSpec G235H mode. The three CO2ice
bands of Per-emb 35 are successfully fitted with the same linear
combination, the results are presented inFigure. The contribution of each individual component
with respect to the total absorption is presented inTable. These fractions are consistent
between the three bands within the reported uncertainties and are
also similar to the fractions derived for IRAS 20126. The alternative
analysis with cold CO2:H2O ice is shown inSupporting Figure 11.

the pure CO280 K, CO2:CH3OH 1:1

1:2 25 K and CO2:CO 1:1 15 K component, respectively. Finally
the green line shows the sum of all the components.

The sharp short-wavelength feature
observed at 4.38
μm is
successfully fitted with the laboratory spectrum of pure CO2ice at 80 K. The pure CO280 K spectrum also reproduces
the short-wavelength peak observed at 2.69 μm in the12CO2combination mode as well as the split peak profile
in the bending mode at 15.2 μm. This pure CO2component
is typically ∼15–20% of the total integrated optical
depth in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35 and the strong contribution
of this component indicates that these ices are undergoing segregation.
The χ2value for the fittings of the 2.70 μm,
4.39 and 15.2 μm bands are 7.54, 0.2, and 5.9, respectively.

We note that the contribution of CO2–CO mixed
ices, previously inferred to be present in cold sources, is very small in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb
35. This lack of CO ice is however consistent with the weak12CO ice absorption band observed at 4.67 μm in both sources
and the strong rotation-vibrational lines of gaseous CO seen in the
4 μm region (Figure). In cold sources the 4.6712CO μm ice band
is strong and often saturated (τ > 6) and there is usually
no
strong OCN–ice feature at 4.60 μm.,In contrast, the 4.67 μm CO ice band in IRAS 20126 has a peak
optical depth of τ ∼ 1.3. This is relatively small compared
to the strong OCN–feature observed in this source
(τ ∼ 1.45). Similarly, the
4.67 μm band in Per-emb 35 has a peak optical depth of τ
∼ 1.3 and has a strong OCN–band of τ
∼ 0.7 (Figure). These spectral features all point toward thermal desorption of
the bulk of the CO ice. The CO2–CO components are
also more degenerate due to their complete overlap with the other
components and as a result they also have the largest relative uncertainties.

A weak
feature is observed at 15.64 μm overlaid on the long-wavelength
wing of the bending mode. We detect this feature in both IRAS 20126
and Per-emb 35 (Figure). The small absorption band is also observed in the laboratory spectrum
of pure CO2ice leading us to conclude that this feature
is likely the bending mode of13CO2.

Bending mode
of13CO2ice. The 15.2 μm
bending of12CO2is shown on optical depth scale
(black) and the purple shaded column shows the absorption feature
overlaid on the wing of the band at 15.64 μm. The purple line
shows the laboratory spectrum of pure CO2at 80 K with
a small absorption feature centered at 15.64 μm.

This band is only clearly visible in the spectrum
of pure CO2ice likely because pure CO2ice
produces sharp
narrow features as can be seen at 2.69, 4.38, and 15.2 μm. When
CO2is diluted in other ices such as H2O and
CH3OH this band probably becomes shallower and broader
and therefore more difficult to detect. Because the13CO2bending mode feature is small and there is a large uncertainty
on the continuum needed to isolate it from the main12CO2ice band, we refrain from doing further quantitative analysis
on this feature in this work.

We quantified12CO2and13CO2column densities from
the 15.2 and 4.39 μm features, respectively, and derived12C/13C = 90 ± 9 in IRAS 20126. The12CO2and13CO2column densities in
Per-emb 35 were measured from the 2.70 μm band, the 4.39 μm
band and the 15.2 μm by Brunken et al. and the12C/13C ratio derived for the 2.70
μm combination mode and the 15.2 μm bending mode are 132
and 99, respectively.

The observational errors are small, ∼10%
and the uncertainty due to the continuum are up to ∼ 20%. The
majority of the error budget, not included in the above error margins,
comes from the uncertainties on the band strengths and can be up to
∼46%. For further details on the error analysis we refer the
reader to Brunken et al. The findings
are summarized inTable.

The12C/13Cice= 90 ± 9 measured in IRAS 20126 is
consistent with the
ratios
measured from the CO2vibrational modes by Brunken et al. in the envelopes of low-mass protostars (theirTable, mean ratio measured
from the 15.2 μm bending modes ∼97 ± 17). It is
slightly elevated with respect to the ratio measured for the ISM ∼
68. This value is at the lower end of
the gas-phase ratio previously measured in this same source by Rubinstein
et al. from hot gaseous CO rotation-vibrational
lines12C/13Cgas> 106.

The CO2–H2O ices that ensue from this reaction
are observed in all the vibrational
modes of CO2,,,,and are part of the polar H2O-rich ice layer that forms
during the translucent cloud phase when atomic H is abundant.

When the young protostar
heats its surrounding envelope, the most
volatile species, including CO ice, sublimate from the grains,as illustrated inFigure. This CO desorption is evident in IRAS 20126 and Per-emb
35 from the weak CO ice band at 4.67 μm and the strong gaseous
CO line-forest spanning the 4 μm spectral region.,This distillation process is also consistent with the experimental
results from Ehrenfreund et al. who showed
that above ∼50 K H2O, CO2and CH3OH become the dominant species in interstellar ice spectra.

Schematic
overview of CO2ice segregation in protostellar
envelopes. The temperature and density zones are separated by the
gray dashed lines and each grain represents a different stage of ice
processing. Observations probe the entire line of sight from the central
regions around the protostar to the outer envelope.

After distillation, segregation of CO2quickly
follows
as temperatures continue to rise in the envelope. During segregation,
the water molecules will rearrange and form links through hydrogen
bonds. The new spatial proximity will allow the CO2molecules
to cluster together and form bonds, producing inclusions of pure CO2ice inside the ice mantle (Figure). Because water
desorbs at a much higher temperature than CO2, the pure
CO2ice will remain trapped on the grain well beyond its
desorption temperature. This multilayer formation mechanism coupled
with the physicochemical processes that follow after, produce the
different components that constitute the ice absorption bands observed
in protostellar spectra. These absorption features include not only
the components that are present on individual dust grains, but also
the absorption of all the ices along the line sight. This extends
from the hot central regions, to the ices in the colder outer envelope (Figure). Envelopes that are exposed to higher levels of protostellar
heating, such as those around luminous protostars, have higher overall
temperature and thus experience higher degrees of ice processing.

Another intrinsic feature
of ice segregation is the deep shoulder
observed at 15.4 μm that is associated with CO2–CH3OH ices.,This shoulder is caused by the
acid–base interaction between the carbon atom of CO2and the hydrogen atom of CH3OH. Ehrenfreund et al. and Dartois et al. both demonstrated with experimental studies that segregation is
vital for the appearance of this shoulder which becomes observable
in laboratory spectra with temperatures ranging between 65–110
K. Many astronomical observations also support these findings, with
numerous detections of this feature in high-mass and luminous protostars including several massive young stellar objects
populating the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) (Rgal< 200 pc).

This shoulder
is well fitted with a laboratory mixture of CO2:CH3OH 1:1 ice at 115 K (Figuresand ). This is consistent
with the temperature range reported in Dartois et al. and the findings in Ehrenfreund et al. who showed that astronomical data are better fitted with
1:1 laboratory mixtures. The CO2:CH3OH 1:1 at
115 K spectrum also successfully reproduces the long-wavelength absorption
features observed at 2.70 and 4.39 μm.

The values presented
inTablesand  show that the fractions
of integrated optical depths per component are similar within reported
error margins. From these results it can be inferred that the12C/13C ratios are also similar between the different
ice components. This indicates that the carbon isotope ratio is likely
set at the formation stage of the different CO2ices and
that fractionation processes such as isotope exchange reactions−appear to not have played a significant role during neither the
water-dominated phase nor the heavy CO freeze-out stages that produce
the CO2:H2O and CO2:CH3OH ices. This ratio also persists throughout the heating stage that
produces the pure CO2component. We note however that this
conclusion is drawn solely on the similarity between these fractions
and that isotope ratios have not been calculated for these individual
components due to lack of experimental data. To the best of our knowledge
there are currently no band strengths for CO2:CH3OH mixtures and band strengths measured at different temperatures
are also limited. Quantifying the carbon isotope ratio for these individual
components will therefore result in large uncertainties.

Tablesand  andFiguresand  show that CO2:CH3OH ices are the main contributors
of the CO2vibrational
modes. This conclusion differs from the findings presented in Pontoppidan
et al. that fitted the 15.2 μm
bands with mostly with CO2–H2O ices.
Our results also differ from the analysis presented in Slavicinska
et al. who fitted the 3.5 μm CH3OH band in IRAS 20126 with mostly CH3OH:H2O and pure CH3OH ices and found no contribution of CO2:CH3OH ices. These differences are discussed in
the following section.

In contrast to
the analysis presented in Pontoppidan
et al. our results suggest that the CO2:CH3OH component accounts for more than 40% of
the three CO2vibrational modes in both IRAS 20126 and
Per-emb 35. To understand the source of this difference, we revisited
the band profile analysis and fitted the 15.2 μm absorption
features of IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35 with the components used in
Pontoppidan et al. The results indicate
that the water component remains dominant in this particular linear
combination because Pontoppidan et al. simulated the 15.4 μm shoulder with a combination of two Gaussian
curves. However, these Gaussian profiles only model the long-wavelength
component of the CO2:CH3OH ices centered at
15.4 μm. The short wavelength component located at 15.2 μm,
which appears in all laboratory spectra of CO2:CH3OH ices, is not included in this model.
As a result, the isolated long-wavelength feature creates a sharp
shoulder that remains detectable in the spectrum even when the contribution
of the CO2:H2O component greatly exceeds that
of the CO2:CH3OH component.

In contrast,
when laboratory spectra of CO2:CH3OH ices, containing
both long- and short-wavelength components, are used, this shoulder
becomes shallower in the final linear combination. This in turn will
require a larger contribution from the CO2:CH3OH ice to reproduce the shoulder and a smaller contribution from
the CO2:H2O component to avoid overproducing
the band. Moreover, the short-wavelength component in the CO2:CH3OH laboratory spectra also constrains the contribution
of the pure CO2component at 15.2 μm since a balance
between the two components is needed to avoid overproducing the double
peak feature.

To confirm that this large fraction of CO2:CH3OH ices is indeed caused by segregation, the
ice absorption bands
of two cold sources in the JOYS+ sample, Per-emb55-a and EDJ183-a,
were also fitted. The results showed that the CO2ice bands
in these cold sources have inherently larger fractions of CO2:H2O ices. The band profile analysis presented in Brunken
et al. also shows a large contribution
of CO2:H2O ices in the13CO2bands of cold protostars. The small contribution of this component
in our heated protostars therefore indicates that segregation must
be occurring for the most part in the H2O-rich ice layer.
If so, then these CO2:H2O ices should be both
heated and showing signs of ice segregation. This is supported by
the analysis where CO2:H2O 1:1 spectra at 100
K are used to fit CO2ice features. Not only are there
clear signs of ice segregation in the 1:1 mixture between 90–120
K with the appearance of the pure CO2peak at 4.38 μm
(Figure), but this
temperature range is also consistent with the temperature range of
the CO2:CH3OH component (115 K). Experimental
results by He et al. also show that CO2needs to account for at least 23% of the ice mixture for
segregation to take place, making the CO2:H2O 1:1 spectrum a more appropriate choice for fitting the ice bands
than the 1:10 mixture. While we do expect to have some contribution
of cold ices in the outer envelope, the spectral features in both
IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35 indicate that the majority of the ices must
be heated. Slavicinska et al. for instance
showed that the 3 μm H2O band of IRAS 20126 has a
crystalline profile. We reiterate that exchanging the cold CO2:H2O spectrum for the warm CO2:H2O spectrum does not change the fractions of integrated optical
depths. An intriguing question for future investigation is whether
the total abundance of CO2:H2O ices in cold
sources equals the sum of the segregated pure CO2ice and
the remaining CO2:H2O ices in heated sources.

Regarding the CH3OH 3.5 μm band in IRAS 20126,
where Slavicinska et al. showed that
the feature is a composite of mostly pure CH3OH ice and
CH3OH:H2O ices, the differences could be due
to different ways of fitting and subtracting the continuum over the
3.5 μm CH3OH band. This weak band is overlaid on
the wing of the 3 μm water band whose shape is highly susceptible
to grain shape and size effects. This introduces an uncertainty on
the actual shape of the continuum. Dartois and d'Hendecourt for instance showed that the wing of the water
band can be significantly raised with respect to the absorption feature
at 3.5 μm. To test this, we revisited this band and raised the
continuum over this region as shown in the left panel ofSupporting Figure 12. The results indicate that
CO2:CH3OH can contribute significantly to this
band if we use this approach (Supporting Figure 12, right panel). Additionally, prior to the analysis, PAH
features peaking in this spectral region had to be removed which further
adds to the uncertainties on the 3.5 μm feature. For the PAH
removal, we followed the methods described Slavicinska et al. Finally, we note that the 3.5 μm band
overlaps with absorption features of ammonia hydrates that also peak
at these wavelengths.

We present band profile analyses of the12CO215.2 μm bending mode, the13CO24.39
μm stretching mode and the12CO22.70
μm combination mode that use a consistent set of laboratory
ice mixtures in the high mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low mass
protostar Per-emb 35. The spectra of both sources show clear signs
that the ices in the envelopes are being heated by the central protostars
prompting segregation of pure CO2ice.

The 15.2 μm double peak feature
and the short-wavelength
features at 2.69 and 4.38 μm are successfully fitted with laboratory
spectra of pure CO2ice at 80 K pointing toward segregation
due to protostellar heating. This pure CO2component accounts
for ∼20% of the total absorption and is consistent between
the vibrational modes and between the low-mass and the high mass-protostar.

The deep shoulder observed at 15.4 μm
is reproduced
with the laboratory spectrum of CO2:CH3OH 1:1
ices at 115 K. This spectrum also fits the long-wavelength features
at 2.70 μm in Per-emb 35 and 4.39 μm in both sources.
This CO2:CH3OH component is dominant in all
the vibrational modes and accounts for more than 40% of the total
absortption band. This is contrary to what has been previously observed
in the CO2bands of non-heated sources where the CO2:H2O ices are the main contributor. This indicates
that CO2is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich
ice layer.

The contribution of each component
with respect to the
total integrated optical depth is similar between the vibrational
modes. This suggests that the12C/13C ratio
is already set at the formation stage of the different CO2ices and that fractionation processes did not play a significant
role.

We report the detection of the
bending mode of13CO2ice at 15.64 μm.
The feature is overlaid
on the long-wavelength wing of the12CO215.2
μm band.

We quantified the column
densities and derived a12C/13Cice∼
90 in IRAS 20126. This value is slightly higher compared to the value
measured for the ISM and lower than the gas-phase ratio recently derived
for IRAS 20126. The12C/13Ciceof Per-emb 35 was previously measured to be ∼99 and
∼132 for the 15.2 μm bending mode and the 2.70 μm
combination mode, respectively, consistent with the values measured
for other low mass sources. The observational uncertainties are ∼10%.

The findings in this work indicate that
segregation
dramatically
changes the structure of these ices and that this process occurs in
a similar manner in both the high-mass and the low-mass protostar.
Future work should investigate whether the total abundance of CO2:H2O ices in non-heated sources matches the sum
of the segregated pure CO2ice and the remaining CO2:H2O ices in heated sources. Furthermore, more
laboratory data of CO2band strengths are needed, in particular
band strengths were CO2is mixed with other ices, such
as CH3OH, as well as band strengths measured at different
temperatures. These measurements are crucial for accurately determining
the column densities of these ices and the carbon isotope ratio. Finally,
since CO2and H2O ice are originally intimately
mixed, additional laboratory data with more mixing ratios are needed
to better study the chemical evolution of this component in both heated
and cold sources.
