Intramedullary spinal cord melanocytic neoplasm (IMSCMN) with hemorrhagic features is rare, and it is even rarer in children. The authors present a pediatric case of an IMSCMN involving the thoracic segment of the spinal cord.

An 11-year-old previously healthy girl experienced intermittent low back pain for 5 months, followed by left foot drop, limb weakness, and abnormal gait. MRI revealed an intramedullary hemorrhagic spinal cord lesion at T9–11, with a long syrinx and cord edema. An MRI study of the brain and the remaining spinal cord was unremarkable. The patient underwent laminectomy and near-total resection of the tumor. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of an atypical melanocytic neoplasm. Dermatological; ear, nose, and throat; and ophthalmological assessments, as well as a positron emission tomography study, were conducted to identify other neoplasms, which yielded unremarkable findings.

This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of IMSCMN in children because of its rarity and nonspecific imaging features. IMSCMN should be considered in pediatric hemorrhagic spinal cord lesions with MRI findings of T1 hyperintensity, T2 hypointensity, and an associated syrinx.

The literature on primary CNS melanocytic neoplasms with hemorrhagic features remains scarce, particularly in the pediatric population, and is limited to case reports or small case series. Accordingly, we report the case of an 11-year-old girl who presented with unilateral foot drop and gait abnormalities. Imaging examination showed a hemorrhagic or hyperintense lesion suggestive of spinal ependymoma. However, intraoperative gross evaluation revealed a dark black, easily fragmented tumor with features not consistent with those of ependymoma or astrocytoma. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of atypical melanocytic neoplasm.

An 11-year-old healthy female patient experienced intermittent low back pain for 5 months. In the weeks preceding her presentation, she developed new-onset left lower limb weakness and an abnormal gait. MRI of the brain and whole spine revealed a solitary, well-defined, oval intramedullary lesion at the T9–11 level (Fig. 1). The lesion demonstrated hypointensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and moderate hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI). These findings were consistent with degraded blood products. Additionally, a long syrinx and cord edema were observed. There was concomitant contrast enhancement in the postcontrast study, supporting the findings of a tumor mass. MRI of the brain and other spinal cord regions showed no remarkable findings.

No suspicious nodular or mass-like enhancement was observed.

The patient underwent a T9–11 laminectomy and intramedullary tumor resection under intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Localization of the T10 vertebra was first achieved using intraoperative radiographic imaging. Following exposure and T10 laminectomy, intraoperative ultrasound was used to assess the tumor extent, prompting extension of the laminectomy to include T9 and T11. This exposure was deemed adequate on visualization of the entire tumor within the surgical field. After durotomy, the spinal cord appeared expanded. A midline myelotomy was performed, guided by dorsal column mapping. The lesion appeared well demarcated, dark colored, and soft, with characteristics largely resembling those of hematoma (Fig. 2). A gliotic plane was identified surrounding the lesion, which exhibited moderate vascularity. During resection, a transient decrease in motor evoked potentials was noted in the right lower limb, which gradually improved over several minutes, allowing the procedure to continue. A near-total resection (> 95%) was achieved. A small remnant of the tumor was left in the cranial aspect due to firm adherence to normal spinal cord tissue.

Histopathological examination of the tumor revealed a melanocytic lesion with focal invasion of the adjacent spinal cord parenchyma, as demonstrated by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining (Fig. 3). The tumor consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of epithelioid cells arranged in sheets and spindle cells organized in fascicles, with areas of focal nest formation. Both cellular components contained abundant cytoplasmic granules of varying sizes and prominent dark brown pigmentation. Focal nuclear atypia was observed, characterized by the presence of large nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were rarely observed, and no evidence of necrosis was identified. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the tumor cells were positive for HMB-45 and Melan-A.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced a favorable recovery, with transient lower limb weakness that gradually improved. A comprehensive workup, including dermatological; ear, nose, and throat; and ophthalmological assessments, as well as a positron emission tomography study, was conducted to identify the primary source of the neoplasm, which yielded unremarkable findings. Molecular analysis of the resected spinal cord melanocytic tumor was performed, and bothBRAFV600 andKRASmutation testing returned negative results. Six months after surgery, the patient regained independent ambulation and resumed participation in sports. No residual or recurrent enhancing intramedullary lesions were observed on follow-up MRI (Fig. 1). The images demonstrated a significant interval improvement in the previously noted long-segment syrinx, particularly proximal to the surgical site.

This report represents a rare case of an intramedullary spinal cord hemorrhagic tumor. Primary spinal cord tumors, such as ependymomas, fibrillary astrocytomas, and primary CNS melanomas, have been reported to cause hemorrhage or hematomyelia.4However, the exact incidence of spinal cord hemorrhagic tumors remains unclear and may be underreported because of challenges in their recognition.5A comprehensive review of 49 cases of IMSCMN was conducted.6–40(Table 1). The average age at diagnosis was 52 years, with a nearly equal sex distribution (24 men and 25 women). The most commonly affected spinal level was T12. MRI findings were unavailable for 10 patients. Hemorrhagic features were identified in 14 patients, highlighting the significant clinical characteristics of these tumors. Surgical outcomes revealed that gross-total resection was achieved in 31 patients, subtotal resection in 10 patients, and near-total resection in 4 patients. MRI findings of intramedullary melanocytic tumors of the spinal cord demonstrate considerable variability. The most frequent characteristics include hyperintensity on T1WI, often accompanied by hypointensity on T2WI, with variable contrast enhancement patterns ranging from uniform to heterogeneous. Hemorrhagic components, surrounding edema, and syringomyelia were observed in some patients, reflecting the aggressive or vascular nature of the lesions.

CE = contrast enhancement; EOR = extent of resection; GTR = gross-total resection; NA = not accessible; NS = not specified; NTR = near-total resection; STR = subtotal resection; UA = unavailable.

Based on these case reports, primary melanocytic neoplasms are considered extremely rare. The annual incidence is 1 in 10 million persons, accounting for less than 0.1% of all CNS tumors.37Moreover, to our knowledge, here, we present the first report of primary melanocytic neoplasm with hemorrhagic features in the pediatric population.

Primary pigmented tumors of the CNS are rare and include melanotic schwannomas, meningeal melanocytomas, CNS blue nevi, and primary melanoma.9Although their exact origin remains unclear, noncutaneous melanomas, such as primary melanocytic neoplasms of the spinal cord, are believed to arise from melanoblasts.39These melanoblasts originate from the neural crest during early embryonic development and are typically found in the normal leptomeninges.39Fuld et al. reported that the thoracic spine is the most common site for IMSCMNs, accounting for approximately 60% of cases, whereas lesions in the cervical and lumbar spine are significantly less common.20The results of our case report align with these findings, as the intramedullary tumor was located in the thoracic region (T9–11).

The diagnosis of primary IMSCMN is determined by the absence of melanoma outside the CNS, the absence of nerve root or dura mater involvement, and histological confirmation of melanoma with no evidence of disease in other CNS locations.16Our patient met these diagnostic criteria. Spinal cord melanocytic tumors are challenging to distinguish from meningiomas, ependymomas, astrocytomas, and schwannomas using radiological imaging alone. They typically appear hyperintense on T1WI and hypointense on T2WI, with lesions showing mild contrast enhancement.40MRI may suggest the presence of a melanocytic lesion. However, the rarity of primary CNS melanocytic lesions often makes a preoperative radiological diagnosis difficult.40The imaging characteristics of primary IMSCMN vary based on the melanocytic content and the presence of hemorrhage or fat.13The initial radiological impression of our patient suggested a hemorrhagic lesion, likely an ependymoma. This highlights how nonspecific imaging characteristics and the rarity of this tumor can contribute to misdiagnosis. In contrast to other hemorrhagic intramedullary spinal cord tumors such as ependymomas or astrocytomas, the suspicion of IMSCMN prompted additional detailed clinical and radiological evaluation to exclude the presence of melanocytic lesions in extracranial organs.

The rarity of IMSCMNs, particularly in children—despite their presumed embryological origin from neural crest–derived melanoblasts—raises important questions. Pediatric presentations may suggest a distinct pathophysiological process, possibly involving additional genetic or developmental factors. Although our patient showed no evidence of neurocutaneous syndromes or extracranial melanoma, further genetic testing (e.g., forGNAQorGNA11mutations) could be informative in similar cases. A recent case series of pigmented brain neoplasms demonstrated that primary CNS melanocytic tumors often harbor theGNAQp.Q209 mutation, suggesting a molecular profile distinct from epithelium-derived melanoma.20This mutation is believed to arise early in tumorigenesis, as seen in uveal melanoma, although it has not been significantly associated with disease-free survival.20Compared with adults, pediatric patients may require tailored long-term surveillance strategies due to spinal growth and neurodevelopment. This case underscores the need for heightened clinical awareness and further investigation into potential syndromic or molecular predispositions in the pediatric population.

IMSCMNs are extremely rare, particularly in pediatric populations. We present the case of an 11-year-old girl with progressive neurological deficits caused by a hemorrhagic intramedullary tumor spanning from T9 to T11. MRI findings included T1 hyperintensity, T2 hypointensity, and syringomyelia—features that initially mimicked ependymoma. Intraoperative visualization revealed a dark, well-demarcated lesion with hematoma-like features. Histopathological analysis confirmed an atypical melanocytic neoplasm. Full systemic and dermatological evaluation ruled out primary extracranial melanoma. Near-total resection was achieved, and the patient had excellent postoperative recovery with radiological resolution of the syrinx. To our knowledge, this is one of the very few reported cases of pediatric IMSCMN with hemorrhagic presentation and favorable outcome following surgical intervention.

This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing IMSCMNs because of their nonspecific imaging features. Hemorrhagic spinal cord lesions should be histopathologically evaluated on resection. Although rare, especially in children, IMSCMNs should be considered in pediatric hemorrhagic spinal cord lesions with progressive deficits.
