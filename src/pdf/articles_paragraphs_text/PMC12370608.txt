Influenza viruses present significant challenges to global health. A rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-based detection system for multiple influenza strains (A, H1N1/H2N2/H3N2/H5N1/H7N9 and B) has been developed to address the limitations of 2-h Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) tests. By using optimized primers targeting key viral proteins (M, NA, HA, PA), the method achieves detection in 10 min with 0.99 log linearity (1–106copies/μL). Clinical validation demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity, effectively distinguishing infections from healthy controls. This portable platform shows strong potential for point-of-care (POC) applications in resource-limited settings, offering timely diagnosis and epidemic control through its rapid and accurate detection capabilities.

Influenza is a respiratory illness causing annual outbreaks. It infects about 10% of the global population and is one of the major causes of death worldwide (Javanian et al.2021). Influenza viruses can cause an acute febrile illness with varying degrees of respiratory and systemic symptoms, affecting any organ (Kalil and Thomas2019; Jones et al.2023). Influenza infection can lead to severe or even life-threatening complications, especially in individuals who are at a higher risk (Clohisey and Baillie2019; Jones et al.2023). Influenza viruses are classified into 198 subtypes based on different nucleoproteins and matrix proteins. Among these subtypes, 131 are prevalent. Currently, the most common subtypes of influenza A viruses that infect people are H1N1 and H3N2, as well as type B disease (Boktor and Hafner2023). There is an urgent need to develop a rapid, selective and sensitive diagnostic method for the detection of influenza viruses, which is hampered by the diversity of influenza strains.

To control the spread of viruses, several methods have been developed for early detection, including virus isolation, nucleic acid testing and antibody/antigen testing (Zhang et al.2014,2020; Vemula et al.2016; Imai et al.2018). Traditional separation methods are time-consuming and require specialized technicians and complex equipment. The identification process is complicated to operate and less sensitive (Holmes et al.2017). Fluorescent immunoassays can rapidly identify influenza viruses, but low detection sensitivity and antibody cross-reactivity prevent simultaneous typing of influenza viruses based on viral surface antigen detection (Zhang et al.2014). For the identification of different viral subtypes, fluorometric PCR is the most recommended method. However, it has certain limitations. Firstly, it is prone to aerosol contamination, which can cause false positive results. Second, from sample collection to results, conventional PCR typically takes at least 2–3 h (Vemula et al.2016). Real-time multiplex PCR amplification of individual target genes has recently been developed. However, it is time-consuming (90–120 min) and requires sophisticated experimental equipment and well-trained operators (Pan et al.2020; Chung et al.2021).

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a selective, fast, and inexpensive technique for detecting pathogenic bacteria (Abd El Wahed et al.2015; Xi et al.2019; Sun et al.2022). Because of its low operating temperature (37–42 °C) and the commercial availability of lyophilized reagents, this method has been used outside the laboratory in remote areas (Daher et al.2016; Nörz et al.2022). For example, we used RPA technology to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses simultaneously in our previous study (Liang et al.2023). The method quantified standard SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA between 102and 105copies/mL with a log linearity of 0.99 within 22 min. The method is now also highly effective in simultaneously detecting Influenza B, H3N2 and H1N1 Virus. However, this method depends on expensive PCR amplifiers and is not replicable in low-resource settings. Therefore, for rapid screening purposes, it may be beneficial to develop a disposable multiplex influenza test kit that utilizes the rapid detection characteristics of RPA.

In this work, for the rapid multiplex co-detection of influenza viruses, we have developed a microfluidic chip based on RPA. This microfluidic device is capable of specific co-detection of influenza A (H7N9, H2N2, H5N1, H3N2, H1N1) and influenza B. Compared to current quantitative fluorescence PCR assays, our device offers the advantages of high accuracy and rapid detection speed. In addition, our chip has a 100% positive detection rate which has been confirmed by the validation of clinical samples.

Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to produce chip replicas was purchased from the 3M Company, St. Paul, MN. Primer, nuclease-free H2O, and magnesium acetate got from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Enzyme in dry powder form was purchased from Suzhou Xianda Gene Technology Co., Ltd (Suzhou, China).

RNA samples (n = 150, therein 120 confirmed cases (by WHO-recommended RT-PCR assays) with a diagnosis of influenza A, and 30 confirmed cases with a diagnosis of influenza B) were prospectively collected from individuals meeting WHO clinical criteria for suspected respiratory viral infection (acute onset fever ≥ 38 °C + cough/anosmia) with symptom duration ≤ 72 h. Control samples (n = 30) were obtained from asymptomatic volunteers with confirmed negative RT-PCR results during routine health screenings. Exclusion criteria: (a) Coinfection with other respiratory pathogens (tested via BioFire FilmArray®RP2.1 panel); (b) Immunocompromised status (e.g., HIV+, chemotherapy within 6 months); (c) Insufficient sample volume (< 200 μL). Total RNA was extracted using QIAamp®Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocols. RNA integrity was validated via RIN (RNA Integrity Number) > 7.0 (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100), A260/A280 ratio 1.8–2.0 (NanoDrop™), Concentration ≥ 20 ng/μL (Qubit®4.0 Fluorometer). RNA Integrity Metrics see in TableS1. Samples failing any criterion (n = 3) were excluded prior to analysis. The study was approved by the ethics committee for clinical research of the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (approval number 2024-1361-L).

To better evaluate the rapid diagnostic system established in this study, we used RT-PCR to assess the viral load in clinical samples from 10 nucleic acid specimens, primarily testing their amplification Ct values, and evaluated the range based on the size of the Ct values. Detailed parameters can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Primer Premier 5 software was used to design specific RPA primers for H3N2, H1N1, H2N2, H5N1, H7N9 and Influenza B using the M, HA and PA sequences. The specific primers for the RPA probes have been designed by the author of the paper and follow the design principles of the RPA probes. The six sets of primers are listed in Table1. All the primers were commercially synthesized by the company Sangon Biotech Co.

The microfluidic chip made of PMMA comprised three layers: a top plate, a bottom plate, and a reaction plate. These circular layers with a diameter of 10 cm were designed using CorelDraw and cut from PMMA with a thickness of 0.5 mm. The reaction plate was laser-cut into three detection units, with each unit containing multiple independent sets of detection holes to detect a virus. The top plate had three additional holes connected to the detection units one by one, and three exhaust holes connected one by one. The bottom plate had fluorescent probes attached to the corresponding position of each detection hole set. Specifically, the microfluidic detection chip we have developed has 24 detection wells, with each area consisting of 8 wells. These wells correspond to the detection of six types of viral nucleic acids mentioned earlier. Additionally, there are two other detection wells: one for the positive control and one for the negative control.

To prepare a 50 μL RPA reaction, combine 2.1 μL of 10 μM forward primer, 2.1 μL of 10 μM reverse primer, and 0.6 μL of 10 μM exo probe specific to H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, or Influenza B (refer to Table1) with 29.5 μL of rehydration buffer, 11.2 μL of nuclease-free water, 2.5 μL of magnesium acetate, and 2 μL of RNA samples.

For a 50µL RPA reaction, 2.1 μL of 10 μM forward primer, 2.1 μL of 10 μM reverse primer and 0.6 μL of 10 μM H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 or Flu B specific exoprobe (see Table1) are mixed with 29.5 µL rehydration buffer, 2.5 µL magnesium acetate, 11.2 µL nuclease-free water and 2 µL RNA samples.

The mixture should then be added to a chip containing lyophilized enzymes, and negative controls should be treated with nuclease-free water. Incubate the chip at 42 °C for 15 min, monitoring fluorescence intensity every 30 s. The thermocycler will automatically measure Cq values. Finally, generate a standard curve to analyze the correlation between RNA concentrations and Cq values.

Real-time PCR amplification was performed using a 50 µL reaction mixture containing 25 µL pre-mixed Ex Taq (probe qPCR), 18 µL RNase-free water, 2 µL RNA template, 2 µL (10 µmol) forward and reverse primers and 1 µL (10 µmol) probe primer. The thermocycling step included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s and an extension at 60 °C for 34 s.

All samples showing inconsistent results between the RPA microfluidic platform and the initial reference RT-PCR test must undergo strict retesting. Specifically, inconsistent samples are tested three times each using both the RPA microfluidic platform and the reference RT-PCR test to ensure the accuracy of the test results.

Using a Nanodrop 1000 UV spectrophotometer, we measured the nucleic acid concentrations of several Influenza A (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9 and H5N1) and Influenza B strains at the 260 nm absorption peak to determine the sensitivity of the chip. The ssRNA copy number was calculated with the formula: ssRNA copy number = 6.02 × 1023× (nucleic acid concentration ng/µL) / (RNA length × 330). After diluting the concentration to 106copies/µL and then further diluting it 10 times to a single copy, we created 7 different concentration gradients. 2 µL of the template was added to the reaction system in order of concentration gradient, with negative control using RNase-free water to test the reaction system’s sensitivity. And Inclusivity testing was performed near the assay’s LOD (FluA: 10 copies/μL; Flu B: 10 copies/μL) to evaluate detection robustness for low-level targets.

To test the efficacy of the primer, we conducted RPA assays using various substances such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), influenza A viruses H1N1, H3N2, influenza B, and other viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and bacteria such asStaphylococcus haemolyticus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus, andHaemophilus influenzae. Exclusivity testing employed high-concentration samples (10⁶ copies/μL) of 14 non-target pathogens to stress-test specificity (Table2). All viral strains and bacterial strains involved in the verification were isolated from the Department of Clinical Laboratory at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.

A total of 180 RNA samples were extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the instructions to validate the accuracy of the RPA microarray-based test. The samples were then amplified using the chip from patients diagnosed with influenza A (n = 120), influenza B (n = 30) and normal donors (n = 30). All clinical samples were obtained from The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (2024-1361-L). Box and whisker analyses were carried out using Origin 8.0 (OriginLab). To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed using GraphPad Prism 8, andp< 0.05 was used to indicate a significant difference.

Healthcare professionals collected virus-containing nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients. Nucleic acids from the virus were obtained according to the instructions provided with the MolPure® Magnetic Swab Viral DNA/RNA Kit. The RPA method was used to screen the RNA samples on an RPA-based microfluidic chip after RNA extraction. First, add viral nucleic acid through six sample wells into the microfluidic chip channel cavity. Then, add amplification reagents one by one independently and seal the sample and vent holes with transparent tape. At the same time, place the amplification chip in our self-developed centrifugal drive real-time fluorescence constant temperature amplification instrument. Under centrifugal force, the reagents are distributed into the circular reaction chambers of the chip, where amplification and real-time detection occur simultaneously. The amplification data was then transferred to a laptop computer for further analysis (Fig.1andS1).

The sensitivity of RPA was analyzed using nucleic acids from various strains of Influenza A (H5N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9, and H1N1) and Influenza B. The nucleic acids were diluted into seven concentration gradients, and each strain was evaluated individually. A negative control with water and a positive control with known positive samples were included. All virus could be detected within 10 min, while the amplified fluorescence signal could reach 2–6 copies in only 10 min. All the influenza A detection primers (H1N1 for example) were able to detect 4–6 copies/μL of viral nucleic acid, and the influenza B detection primers were able to detect up to 4 copies of viral nucleic acid (see Fig.2for details) were selected for standard culture. Nucleic acid was extracted and converted to copy numbers.

To verify the specificity of the RPA primer set, each of the six sets of primers designed was tested, and as shown in the Table3displays the specificity detection fluorescence signal diagram. Non-specific amplification was performed on RPA microfluidic chips. As shown in Table3, all primers are targeted to amplify only the corresponding viral nucleic acids and do not amplify other viruses. Exclusivity testing employed high-concentration samples (10⁶ copies/μL) of 14 non-target pathogens to stress-test specificity. All results met acceptance criteria (inclusivity: 100% detection; exclusivity: 0% false positives), as detailed in Table3. In conclusion, RPA successfully detected fluorescence signals for all six types of Influenza. It has been observed that there is a linear relationship between the concentration of the sample and the time it takes to reach the maximum intensity of the fluorescence. This means that as the concentration of the template increases, the intensity of the fluorescence will also increase and the time taken to reach the maximum intensity of fluorescence will decrease.

Influenza B and Influenza A (H5N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9, and H1N1) nucleic acids (106copies/μL) were used on the RPA microfluidic chip as templates for amplification and the fluorescence quantitative PCR method was used to verify the correlation. The results show that this method can detect influenza virus within 5 min, and single virus gene detection can be completed within 10 min. The obvious difference is that real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR takes 45 min to complete the detection of the virus. In summary, there was no significant difference between RPA microfluidic chip detection results and fluorescence quantitative PCR detection results when the accuracy of fitting results to quantitative PCR amplification results was analyzed. The matching rate was 100%.

RPA amplification was performed on RPA microfluidic chips using 180 samples of nucleic acid extracted from clinical specimens, including 150 throat-swab specimens from streams A, B, and 30 cases for healthy control. The results, shown in Table3, indicate that the detection rate of influenza B and influenza A (H5N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9, and H1N1) samples identified and confirmed by RT-PCR was 100%. In addition, the RPA microfluidic chip reaction system has a significantly shorter detection time compared to RT-PCR, making it suitable for the initial detection of real samples.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection is crucial for timely administration of specific antiviral treatment, effective control of outbreaks, and reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infections during seasonal epidemics and pandemics (Okuya et al.2024). A multi-channel electrochemical immunoassay (MEIA) platform for on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 influenza virus was developed based on an array of disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE). The results from testing 79 clinical samples of H1N1 influenza showed that the proposed MEIA platform had sensitivity comparable to ELISA, but a false positive rate of 5.4% for negative samples (Li et al.2021). In our previous study, we were able to detect influenza viruses in eight samples at once using RPA technology. However, this method still requires sophisticated amplification instruments (Liang et al.2023). Professor Nie has developed a detection method based on RPA and CRISPR-Cas12a technology for identifying SARS-CoV-2, type A influenza, and type B influenza viruses. They have integrated microfluidic chips with lateral flow test strips, enabling testing completion within 1 h, with a detection limit of approximately 100 copies/μL (Wang et al.2023). Coincidentally, a team led by Zhao from the Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with a team led by Bian from Shanghai Ocean University, has developed an integrated microfluidic chip capable of simultaneously detecting 12 respiratory pathogens, including influenza A virus. The detection process takes about 70 min, with a detection limit as low as 10 copies/μL (Li et al.2024). However, although the method integrates molecular detection and microfluidic chip technology, it still has shortcomings in terms of detection sensitivity and duration. The detection time is too long for initial screening of large numbers of samples, and the sensitivity is also relatively high. Wang et al. developed a rapid and sensitive RT-RPA/CRISPR method for detecting AIV (Zhou et al.2023). The detection system showed a consistency and concordance rate of 97.5% when compared to RT-PCR and virus isolation methods for poultry samples, However, there is still a lot of potential to improve the sensitivity.

In this pilot study, an innovative microfluidic chip integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for multiplexed influenza virus (Flu B, H5N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9, and H1N1) detection, addressing critical limitations of current diagnostic methods. This chip can help facilitate point-of-care (POC) testing in settings that have limited resources. Simultaneously, we performed the RPA test designed for influenza B and H5N1, H3N2, H1N1, H2N2, H7N9 (Table1) to better determine whether the clinical samples were coinfected with Influenza A/B. It should be noted that the probability of a rapid mutation is very low for Influenza A and Influenza B. The detection primers that we have designed are targeted to highly conserved sequences of the genes and the detection of a single gene is already effective. For the detection of influenza virus infection in infants in resource-limited settings, a body temperature-activated microfluidic device based on RPA has great potential.

Based on our research findings, we’ve determined that each reaction requires 2 μL of RNA samples. It’s important to note that each reaction well contains only 2 μL of template, and it amplifies a single target gene separately, without mixing reactions. We utilized the magnetic bead method for RNA extraction, which can elute 70–80 μL of RNA template from a 300 μL throat swab at a time. This amount is sufficient to meet the requirement of 2 μL of template for the experiment we are performing. Using this method, RNA amplification can be completed in just 10 min at 42 °C. We’ve concluded that our RPA assay can detect up to 1 copy/μL (2 copies per reaction) of influenza virus. This makes it particularly useful for identifying low-copy viral infections. To benchmark the real-time multiplex detection capabilities of our platform against established molecular diagnostics, we conducted a comparative evaluation with leading commercial systems (Abbott ID NOW, Roche Cobas® Liat, Cepheid GeneXpert) (Table4). Our integrated microfluidic-RPA platform demonstrates unparalleled performance for rapid influenza subtyping, simultaneously identifying six distinct subtypes within 10 min. This represents a significant advancement in multiplexing speed and capacity, surpassing the current limit of two targets achievable by the comparator platforms. Furthermore, the system exhibits exceptional analytical sensitivity (detecting down to 2 copies/μL) and maintains 100% specificity. These attributes-ultra-rapid multiplex detection, high sensitivity, specificity, and field portability-collectively establish our platform as a transformative point-of-care technology, offering critical advantages for pandemic preparedness and response.

In addition, the developed RPA detection technology has extremely high specificity for Influenza B, H5N1, H3N2, H1N1, H2N2, and H7N9. By simultaneously testing for influenza B and A subtypes, we have been able to quickly identify and categorize common influenza in outpatients. At the same time, H5N1 and H7N9, which are known to be highly pathogenic, are included in the tests to control the spread of the virus promptly. As shown in Table3, samples from 150 patients with influenza A and 30 RT-PCR-compliant RNA samples from healthy donors were used for clinical validation. B patients (n = 30) and RT-PCR-compliant RNA samples from both healthy controls (n = 30) were used for clinical validation, and RPA detection was 100% accurate. RPA results were in 100% agreement with RT-PCR results (Table2), with the advantage of shorter detection times (10 vs. 45 min) (Table2). The most important thing is that the established detection method is effective in identifying the type of influenza. It should be noted that the fluorescence signals used to amplify RPA in this study were collected every 30 s. Therefore, 30 s corresponded to 1 Cq value. Our sensitivity assessment strictly follows the recommended triple-repetition protocol, as shown in the supplementary chip structure diagram, where one detection chip is divided into various regions. This design allows for three repeated tests of the same sample. During our sensitivity testing, we serially diluted the nucleic acid samples (from 106to 100copies/μL) and conducted three independent replicate experiments at each concentration. Sensitivity is defined as the lowest concentration at which all three replicates returned a positive signal within 15 min; in fact, our experiment can be completed in 10 min. According to our optimized protocol, no Ct values greater than 30 were observed within the 15-min timeframe, ensuring robust target detection (R2= 0.998). To account for the possibility of unspecific amplification or other background contamination signals in low copy samples, we set the cutoff for Influenza H3N2 at 30 Cq,i.e., the amplification response time was 15 min. If it takes longer than 15 min to amplify, we consider it a negative result, even if a weak fluorescence amplification signal is seen. These results indicate that the RPA assay holds great promise for detecting Influenza B, H5N1, H3N2, H1N1, H2N2, and H7N9. In addition, it can be adapted for the detection of multiple infectious agents at the point of care (POC) in settings with limited resources.

Our chip focuses on two core threats: seasonal influenza (H1N1/H3N2) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1/H7N9): (a) Seasonal subtypes: covering the globally dominant strains of the past five years (H1N1, H3N2), which account for over 95% of human cases; (b) Avian-origin subtypes: targeting H5N1 (Clade 2.3.4.4b) and H7N9 (Yangtze River Delta lineage) with cross-species potential, with a mortality rate exceeding 30%, and cases of family clustering. Regarding why we did not include a broad A-type target, primers for the M gene conserved region easily cross-react with other members of the A-type virus group, potentially leading to false positives. Finally, we retained H2N2 testing based on three considerations: (a) Historical re-emergence risk: people under 40 have no immunity since the 1957 H2N2 pandemic; (b) Vaccine development needs: H2HA is a universal vaccine candidate target, requiring rapid typing support for strain screening; (c) Surveillance value: the continuous circulation of H2N3 in pigs may cause human infections through reassortment. Concerning the hierarchical detection algorithm, our consideration is that when the chip detects an A-type influenza positive but seasonal subtypes (H1/H3) negative, we will initiate secondary testing, combining epidemiological history (avian contact history) and clinical symptoms (lymphopenia/pneumonia) to specifically retest H5/H7/H2 targets. We selected the HA, PA, and M gene regions for influenza virus testing because of their high variability and subtype specificity, which makes it possible to accurately distinguish between different subtypes of influenza A and B.

While our current study did not include formal coinfection validation, we wish to emphasize three key points supporting the clinical relevance and robustness of our approach: (1) Global epidemiological surveillance (WHO 2024; Lancet ID 2023) confirms the exceptionally low prevalence (< 0.8%) of clinically significant Flu A/Flu B coinfections, with meta-analyses confirming no increased severity (OR = 1.12, 95%CI 0.94–1.33) or mortality (RR = 0.97,p= 0.41) versus single infections; (2) During early symptomatic presentation (when > 92% of patients seek care), viral interference typically results in one dominant pathogen (> 5-log higher load), making secondary targets clinically irrelevant due to sub-detection thresholds; (3) Our 18-plex chip architecture demonstrated zero cross-talk across all channels even at extreme concentration gradients (106 vs 10 copies/μL), with 100% specificity against most respiratory pathogens in mixed backgrounds. We acknowledge this scenario warrants further characterization and are currently generating inactivated coinfection panels (H1N1 + Victoria lineages) for a dedicated follow-up study. This phased strategy prioritizes urgent clinical deployment while rigorously addressing edge cases through targeted research.

It should be noted that (1) the preliminary scale of clinical validation (n = 180 samples), which prioritizes proving the concept of chip core functionality rather than epidemiological breadth; (2) incomplete subtype coverage (currently Flu A includes H1N1/H3N2/H5N1, etc.; Flu B includes Victoria/Yamagata), acknowledging that rare strains (such as H9, H7, H10 subtypes) require further validation in the future; (3) the need for technological maturity, including the scalability of chip multiplex testing (currently 18 samples per run, ideally 48 or even 96), aiming to reduce the cost per test. In the future, we will validate performance with large-scale viral samples across multiple centers. Crucially, we view these as intentional phased steps rather than fundamental limitations: This study establishes a robust technical foundation (‘sample-to-signal’), laying the groundwork for the next phase ‘sample-to-answer’ system, which integrates the solid-phase nucleic acid extraction (SPNE) module on the same microfluidic chip, truly achieving ‘sample-in-result-out’. We believe this candid and forward-looking perspective clarifies the current position of the detection method along its translational trajectory and aligns with the real-world diagnostic evolutionary path.

In summary, our influenza detection system has the potential to be widely applied in clinical settings, improving the early diagnosis rate of influenza, which helps in taking treatment measures, reducing the spread of influenza and the occurrence of complications. It can even assist health departments in quickly obtaining information on influenza outbreaks, enabling timely formulation of control strategies.

In addition, a ROC curve was plotted for clinical validation, and the RPA assay had a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity set of 90% for H1N1(Fig.3A), H2N2(Fig.3B), H3N2(Fig.3C), H5N1(Fig.3D), H7N9(Fig.3E) and Flu B (Fig.3F) influenzas viruses, respectively, to identify infected patients from healthy controls. The results demonstrate that the developed RPA assay exhibited good diagnostic performance with clinical samples.

In conclusion, using an RPA approach and microfluidics, we have developed an accurate and rapid platform for the diagnosis of Influenza B and Influenza A (H5N1, H3N2, H7N9, H1N1, H2N2). The test showed a sensitivity of 100% to discriminate patients with flu A (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9) and flu B from healthy controls, with a specificity of 100% for each. The assay could potentially be used for influenza screening or infection monitoring as an alternative to RT-PCR at the point of care (POC).
