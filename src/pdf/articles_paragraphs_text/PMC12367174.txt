In this article, we have constructed generalizedq-difference Motzkin sequence spacesM0q(Δqm),Mcq(Δqm),Mpq(Δqm)andM∞q(Δqm)by composingq-Motzkin matrix with generalizedq-difference matrix in the spacesc0,c,lp,l∞, respectively and explore their topological properties. We determine the bases forMcq(Δqm)andM0q(Δqm)and computeα-,β- andγ-duals of the newly defined spaces. Further, we characterize some class of matrix mappings from the spacesM0q(Δqm)andMcq(Δqm)to the spacesc,c0,cs,cs0,l∞,l1,bs. Lastly, compact operators are characterized on the spacesM0q(Δqm)using Hausdorff measure of noncompactness.

Sequence spaces have played a vital role across various branches of mathematics, such as functional analysis, operator theory, and approximation theory. The importance of sequence spaces has sparked considerable interest among researchers in summability theory. They have introduced and investigated different types of sequence spaces to uncover their unique properties. For examplel∞,lp,c,c0,denote the spaces of all bounded,p-summable, convergent and null sequences, respectively. Further,cs,cs0,bsdenote the spaces of all convergent, null and bounded series, respectively. Throughout the paper, we will denoteN,RandCas the set of all natural, real and complex numbers, respectively. A sequence spaceXis called an FK-space if it is a complete linear metric space with continuous coordinatespn:X→Candpn(x)=xnfor allx=(xk)∈X,n∈N, and a normed FK-space is called a BK-space. For example,c,c0andl∞are BK spaces with the norm‖x‖=supr∈N|xr|. Also,lpis a BK-space with the norm defined by‖x‖lp=(∑k=0∞|xk|p)1p,1≤p<∞.

Letω,Ψdenote the set of all real sequences and the set of all finite sequences, respectively. An FK-spaceX⊃Ψis said to have AK if everyx=(xk)∈Xhas a unique representationx=∑k=0∞xke(k),wheree(k)is the sequence whose only non-zero term is 1 in thekthplace for eachk∈N[1]. The spacesc0andlphave AK [2].

The primary objective of classical theory revolves around the generalization of convergence concepts for both series and sequences. Its main goal is to provide a framework through which limits can be assigned to series and sequences that do not exhibit convergence. This is achieved through the use of transformations defined by infinite matrices. The preference for utilizing matrices, rather than general linear mappings, is based on the fact that a linear mapping between two sequence spaces can be represented by an infinite matrix.

The set of all these matrices is represented by the notation (Z,W). A sequence (xk) isP−summable toLif the sequencePxconverges toL. We say thatPmapsZregularly intoWiflimkxk=limPx,∀(xk)∈Zand we denote the space of such matrices by (Z,W)reg.

It holds considerable importance in the development of new sequence spaces. Moreover, ifPis a triangle andXis a BK-space thenXPis a BK-space. Many researchers have used this idea to construct new Banach sequence spaces by applying it to special triangles. To know about these sequence spaces, one can see [3–9].

Motzkin numbers, named after Theodore Motzkin, are a remarkable sequence of integers. In mathematics, therthMotzkin number represents the count of distinct chords that can be drawn betweenrpoints on a circle without intersecting. It is important to note that the chords do not necessarily have to touch all the points on the circle.

Motivated by the aforementioned works onq-calculus, the application ofq-difference operators, and Motzkin numbers in various mathematical and scientific disciplines, in section 2, we construct generalized Motzkin sequence spacesℳ0q(Δqm),ℳcq(Δqm),ℳpq(Δqm), andℳ∞q(Δqm)usingq-difference operators. Section 3 explores some topological properties and establishes the Köthe duals of the spacesℳ0q(Δqm),ℳcq(Δqm),ℳpq(Δqm), andℳ∞q(Δqm). Section 4 presents theorems and corollaries related to matrix transformations from the spacesℳ0q(Δqm)andℳcq(Δqm)into the classical sequence spacesℓ∞,c,c0,ℓ1,bs,cs,cs0. Section 5 investigates the compactness of certain operators defined on the spaceℳ0q(Δqm). Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main findings of the manuscript.

Theorem 2.2.The spacesMcq(Δqm),M0q(Δqm),Mpq(Δqm)andM∞q(Δqm)are linearly isomorphic to c,c0,lpandl∞,respectively.

1.the set{ξ(0)(q),ξ(1)(q),ξ(2)(q),…}forms the basis for the spaceM0q(Δqm)and everyv∈M0q(Δqm)has a unique representationv=∑s=0∞usξ(s)(q).

2.the set{e,ξ(0)(q),ξ(1)(q),ξ(2)(q),…}forms the basis for the spaceMcq(Δqm)and everyv∈Mcq(Δqm)has a unique representation of the formv=we+∑s=0∞(us−w)ξ(s)(q),wherew=lims→∞us=lims→∞(Mq(Δqm)v)s.

which is a contradiction with the assumption thatus=(Mq(Δqm)vr)sfor eachs∈N.Hence, the representationv=∑s=0∞usξ(s)(q)is unique.

In this section, we computeα-,β- andγ-duals of the spacesMcq(Δqm),M0q(Δqm),Mpq(Δqm)andM∞q(Δqm). Before proceeding, we recall the definitions ofα-,β- andγ-duals.

Before proceeding further, we recall certain lemmas from [25] that are necessary for determining the duals. Throughout the paper, letFdenotes the family of all finite subsets ofN0andp^be the compliment ofp, that is,1p^+1p=1.

Lemma 3.3.H=(hst)∈(c0,l∞)if and only ifEq (6)holds.

Then[M0q(Δqm)]β=a2(q)∩a3(q)and[Mcq(Δqm)]β=a2(q)∩a3(q)∩a4(q).

Theorem 3.7.Theγ-dual of the spacesM0q(Δqm)andMcq(Δqm)is a3(q).

Proof:From equationEq (8), we realize that(zv)=(zsvs)∈l1, wheneverv∈Mpq(Δqm)if and only ifG(q)u∈l1,wheneveru∈lp.Thus, we deduce thatz= (zp) belongs to theα-dual of the spacesMpq(Δqm)if and only if the matrixG(q)∈(lp,l1.)Thus, from Lemma 3.4/(vi), we conclude[Mpq(Δqm)]α={b1(q),if0<p≤1b2(q),if1<p<∞.

1.[Mpq(Δqm)]β={b4(q)∩b5(q),0<p≤1b4(q)∩b6(q),1<p<∞.

Proof:From equationEq (9), we realize thatzv=(zsvs)∈cswheneverv=(vs)∈Mpq(Δqm)if and only ifH(q)u∈cwheneveru=(us)∈lp.This yields thatz= (zs) belongs to theβ-dual of the spaceMpq(Δqm)if and only if the matrixH(q)∈(lp,c).Thus, from Lemma 3.4/(v), we have[Mpq(Δqm)]β={b4(q)∩b5(q),if0<p≤1b4(q)∩b6(q),if1<p<∞.

In this section, we determine necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix transformation from the spacesMcq(Δqm)andM0q(Δqm)to the spacesl∞,c,c0,l1,bs,cs,cs0. The following theorem is fundamental in our investigation.

Now, by using the results presented in [25] together with Theorem 4.11, we obtain the following results.

4.L=(lst)∈(Mcq(Δqm);l1)iffEq (19),Eq (20)andEq (29)hold, andEq (25)also hold.

5.L=(lst)∈(Mcq(Δqm);bs)iffEq (19),Eq (20)andEq (29)hold, and Eq (26) also hold.

LetXandYbe Banach spaces. LetUXdenotes the open ball in the spaceXandB(X,Y)be the set of all bounded linear operatorsT:X→Y, is a Banach space with the norm given by‖T‖=supx∈UX‖T(x)‖Y. Further, we denote‖z‖X*=supu∈UX|∑t=0∞ztut|,provided the expression on the right hand side exists and is finite [28]. A linear operatorT:X→Yis said to be compact if the domain ofTis all ofXand for every bounded sequence(xn)∈X,the sequence (T(xn)) has a subsequence which converges inY.

LetXandYbe any two BK spaces, then every matrixP∈(X,Y)defines a linear operatorTP∈B(X,Y),whereTPz=Pzfor allz∈X(see Theorem 3.2.4 of [33]). Moreover, ifX⊃Ψis a BK-space then‖TP‖=‖P‖(X,Y)=supn∈N0‖P‖X*<∞(see Theorem 1.23 of [29]).

Lemma 5.10.‖TL‖=‖L‖(M0q(Δqm),U)=sups∈N0(∑t|ast|)<∞holds forL∈(M0q(Δqm),U),whereU∈{c0,c,l∞}.

Lemma 5.11.[35] LetX⊃Ψbe a BK-space. Then the following statements hold.

1.L∈(X,l∞),then0≤‖TL‖χ≤lim sups‖Ls‖X*and TLis compact if and only iflims→∞‖Ls‖X*=0.

2.L∈(X,c0),then‖TL‖χ=lim sups‖Ls‖X*and TLis compact if and only iflims→∞‖Ls‖X*=0.

3.If X has AK orX=l∞andL∈(X,c),then12lim sups‖Ls−l‖X*≤‖TL‖χ≤lim sups‖Ls−l‖X*,where l= (lt)andlt=limslstfor eacht∈N0.

andTLis compact if and only iflimn(supA∈Fn‖∑s∈ALs‖X*)=0,whereFnis the sub-collection ofFconsisting of all nonempty and finite subsets ofNwith elements that are greater than n.

1.IfL∈(M0q(Δqm),l∞),then0≤‖TL‖χ≤lim sups∑s|ast|holds.

2.IfL∈(M0q(Δqm),c),then12lim sups∑t|ast−lt|≤‖TL‖χ≤lim sups∑t|ast−lt|holds.

3.IfL∈(M0q(Δqm),c0),then‖TL‖χ=lim sups∑t|ast|holds.

LetL∈(M0q(Δqm),l∞).Since the series∑t=1∞lstxtconverges for eachs∈N0,we haveLs∈[M0q(Δqm)]β.From Lemma 5.8, we have‖Ls‖M0q(Δqm)*=‖As‖c0*=‖As‖l1=∑t|ast|,for eachs∈N0.By using Lemma 5.11 (i), we deduce that0≤‖TL‖χ≤lim sups∑s|ast|.

LetL∈(M0q(Δqm),c).By Lemma 5.9, we haveA∈(c0,c).Hence, from Lemma 5.11 (iii), we have12lim sups‖As−a‖c0*≤‖TL‖χ≤lim sups‖As−a‖c0*, wherea= (at) andat=limsastfor eacht∈N0.Moreover, Lemma 5.7 implies that‖As−a‖c0*=‖As−a‖l1=(∑t|ast−at|)for eachs∈N0.

LetL∈(M0q(Δqm),c).Since,‖Ls‖M0q(Δqm)*=‖As‖c0*=‖As‖l1=∑t|ast|,for eachs∈N0,from Lemma 5.11(ii), we have‖TL‖χ=lim sups∑t|ast|.

Moreover, Lemma 5.5 implies that‖∑s∈FAs‖c0*=‖∑s∈FAs‖l1=(∑t|∑s∈Fast|).

4.TLis compact forL∈(M0q(Δqm),l1)if and only iflimn‖L‖(M0q(Δqm),l1)(n)=0,where‖L‖(M0q(Δqm),l1)(n)=supA∈Fn(∑t|∑s∈Aast|).

Due to the vast application of quantum calculus, Motzkin numbers and difference operator in various mathematical and scientific disciplines, we have constructed generalizedq-difference Motzkin sequence spacesMcq(Δqm),M0q(Δqm),Mpq(Δqm)andM∞q(Δqm)and explore their topological properties. We determine Schauder bases forMcq(Δqm)andM0q(Δqm)and computeα-,β- andγ-duals of the newly defined spaces. Further, we characterize some matrix mappings from the spacesM0q(Δqm)andMcq(Δqm)to the spacesl∞,c,c0,l1,bs,cs,cs0. Lastly, compact operators are characterized on the spacesM0q(Δqm).
