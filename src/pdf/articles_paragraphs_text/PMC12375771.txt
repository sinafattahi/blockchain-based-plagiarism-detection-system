As the fear of infection is a crucial factor in the progress of the disease in the population. We aim, in this study, to investigate a susceptible-protected-infected-recovered (SPIR) epidemic model with mixed diffusion modeled by local and nonlocal diffusions. These types of diffusion are used to model the fear effect of being infected by the population. The model is shown to be well-posed; the solution exists, is positive, and is unique. The variational expression is obtained to determine threshold role of, also known as the basic reproduction number. Indeed, for, we show that the epidemic will extinct, corresponding to the global asymptotic stability of the infection-free equilibrium state. However, when, the existence of the infection equilibrium state and the uniform persistence of the solution have been proved. The Lyapunov function have been used to show the global asymptotic stability of the infection equilibrium state. Moreover, we compared the obtained results with the classicalSIRepidemic model for determining the required protection function for stopping the disease, which can be obtained by reducingbelow one.

Scarcely, no models have incorporated the impact of fear, even though it is easily spread. A mathematical and computational model that integrated both fear dynamics and contagion disease was presented by Epstein et al.3. Valle et al.4studied a model that discusses the impact of fear-based homestay as behavior change on the expansion of pandemic influenza. But the question still remains if it is enough to stop the progress of the pandemic.

In investigating and understanding the spread of infectious diseases, mathematical and computational models play a significant role. The objective of these investigations is to anticipate the consequences of some specific public health interventions such as vaccination5, treatment6, education7, media effect8, lockdown9when applied to contain the spread of disease. These studies have been very helpful in discovering new public health safety measures and determining the most efficient measure that would dampen the disease under consideration. Interestingly, the non-infected class rigorously practices and respects the new health interventions as they become cautious about getting infected.

The spread of disease among people can be reduced through educational campaigns and some controlling mechanisms10. One such control measure is the homestay, which we will refer to in our paper as “protection.” An observation indicates that the susceptible class is the one that is scared of getting infected the most. Moreover, adapting the mode of protection varies from person to person within the non-infected class, as some would have preferred vaccination while others would have opted for isolation or maybe the combination of these.

It is to highlight that the global dynamics of a delayed epidemic model is governed by its basic reproduction number, and the goal of carrying out protection-related studies is to find the protection effort required to reducebelow one. Finding the most efficient protective system for different populations has always been challenging. Mezouaghi et al.11used a similar approach to find the required minimal protection rateto stop an epidemic. In12, the protection measure’s effect on the spread of infection was studied using an age-structured model in which the obtained basic reproduction number represented the equilibrium states, which were also globally stable.

It is to be noted that to date, all proposed mathematical models either use the local dispersion15,16,19–21or the nonlocal dispersion13,14,17,18,22. Our paper introduces a noble approach to building a spatiotemporal model that infuses both local and nonlocal dispersion to investigate the effect of fear on the spread of the disease. In our model, the extremely careful movements of the non-infected populace (the susceptible and the protected category) due to the fear of getting infected across the studied area(assumed as a bounded set in) is considered by the local-diffusion operator (Laplacian operator or random diffusion). By definition, the random diffusion represents that the movements are done in the neighborhood of the original pointx. This behavior is modeled by using the S-equation and P-equation of a delayed epidemic model. Here, it is worth mentioning that most movements are used for extreme needs, such as running errands. Moreover, we can’t emphasize less that it is hard to study fear without the spatial movements of the individuals as they are highly influenced by it. On the other hand, after becoming infected, a person with agoraphobia may experience increased mobility, as they may need to visit hospitals and other locations, leading to a significant rise in their movement compared to their initial (susceptible) status. This type of behavioral change is also observed with some sexually transmitted diseases, where individuals may initially overemphasize precautions, potentially contributing to agoraphobia. Media coverage can further amplify agoraphobia within the population. Numerous diseases, such as COVID-19, influenza, chickenpox, hepatitis A, and Ebola, have shown similar influences on mobility.

Determining the global dynamics of the model (1) is the true motivation of our paper. Moreover, we compare the dynamics of (1) with the classical SIR epidemic model to characterize the influence of the protection on reducing the epidemic. We will proceed by taking into consideration the effect of the protection forceon the containment of the epidemic and by assuming that(the basic reproduction number corresponding to the SIR model). The focus of this paper is to search for the optimal protection forceso that the basic reproduction numberof (1) becomes less than one, which leads eventually to the containment of the epidemic. This protection forcenot only influences the temporal behavior of the solution but also has a strong relationship with the fear among the individuals.

To achieve this goal, the manuscript is organized as follows. In section “Basic results”, we provide some basic results to show that our system is well-posed, i.e., its solution exists, is unique, and is positive. Further, we have shown that the model admits a unique infection-free equilibrium state (IFEs). We concluded the section by calculating the corresponding. In section “IFEs”, the Lyapunov function has been used to prove that IFEs when, is globally stable. Section “IEs” is provided with the proof of the existence of the infection equilibrium state (will be denoted by IEs), the solution, and its uniform persistence when. Moreover, we have shown that the IEs is globally asymptotically stable when one of the diffusion coefficientsis a zero. In section “Relationship between local and corresponding nonlocal diffusion”, we determined the relationship between local and nonlocal diffusion and discussed how nonlocal diffusion generalizes local diffusion. In section “The situation of the epidemic influenced by the protection force”, we have presented our findings about how protection is helpful in stopping the epidemic by calculating the required minimal protection force. Our mathematical results have been supported numerically in section “Numerical investigation of the results”.

We will now proceed with the final segment of our proof. From Theorem1–2, we infer that the global solution of (5) exists and is unique. Sincedefined by (10) is a positively invariant set, the semiflowis point dissipative. If neithernoris a zero then the semiflow is compact, and consequently, the semigroupis completely continuous, and by42, Corolary 3.2]it is asymptotically smooth. However, if eitheroris a zero, then the semiflowis not compact, but it iscondensing, by applying42, Lemma 3.2.5], we deduce the asymptotic smoothness of. Therefore,42, Theorem 3.4.6]implies a global compact attractor.

In the foregoing analysis, we have examined two limiting cases: (i) the case of purely local diffusion, whereand, and (ii) the case of purely nonlocal diffusion, whereand. These cases were considered in order to separately assess the individual effects of each dispersal mechanism on the global dynamics of the system. Nonetheless, the general case in which bothandholds is more biologically realistic and theoretically intricate.

It is important to emphasize that, in the local diffusion case, the Lyapunov functional is constructed using a test function of the form, which appears as the integrand weight in the functional. Conversely, in the nonlocal diffusion case, the corresponding test function is, associated with the integral expression. In the general setting with both local and nonlocal dispersal, the principal difficulty lies in identifying an admissible test function that ensures the non-positivity of the time derivative of the Lyapunov functional.

Under the additional simplifying assumption that all model parameters are constant, the optimal test function can be chosen to be the constant function(or any other strictly positive constant), which significantly facilitates the analysis. However, in the fully general case with spatially heterogeneous coefficients, the construction of a suitable Lyapunov functional or test function remains an open and challenging problem.

It can be observed that the right-hand side of (34) has no protection force(for more details, see the elliptic equation (31)). Therefore, we getwheneververifies the inequality (34), indicating that the protection measure controls the epidemic.

Notice thatis constant with respect to. Clearly,Fis a decreasing function inand, and based on the fact that, we have. Since, we infer thatsuch that. Moreover, forthe inequality (34) is not verified (means), and for, the inequality (34) holds (means). Therefore, we deduce that the protection can help in stopping the disease.

Substituting this estimate into the variational formulation of the basic reproduction number, by following the aforementioned methodology, shows that the delay influences. However, the reduction remains modest, sinceand its influence on the principal eigenvalue is limited.

Now, we test the theoretical results in the subsections given below.

That means the inequality (34) holds, which means that the IFEs become globally asymptotically stable. For these regards, we plot Fig.5.

These results highlight the significant impact of the kernel functionon the value of the basic reproduction number, and thus on the underlying dynamics of the epidemic model.

The fear of the spread of infection always resides globally because of its effective transmission from the infected population to the susceptible ones. Although a small number of individuals are prone to get infected as fear grows, we need to find some methodologies that can reduce the spread of any infectious disease by minimizing the transmission of infection. In this paper, we have introduced a novel SPIR epidemic model that couples mathematical modeling of the infectious disease and the impact of its induced fear on the social interactions and behavior changes in the population by providing protection as a safety measure against all odds. Moreover, it contains both local and nonlocal diffusions and investigates the effect of fear on the mobility of the population by takingand, one at a time.

We proved that this SPIR model is well-posed and has a globally defined solution. The existence of a global compact attractor inis strongly supported by the fact that the semiflow given byiscondensing map. For the threshold quantity, we have obtained the global extinction of the disease, i.e., the IFEs are globally asymptotically stable for. The global persistence of the disease, i.e., the SPIR model under consideration, is uniformly persistent forand has an IE that is.

We have further found the required minimal protection ratewhich is needed to stop the epidemic by reducing thebelow one in accordance with the assumption. In the last part of the paper, we illustrated our findings by numerical simulation that shows that the disease eventually dies out by protecting a precise portion of the healthy population.

We strongly urge that the study in this paper can help investigate the spread, transmission, fear rate, and the minimum protection needed for contagious infections from a very small scale to a large scale, such as COVID-19 disease. Although protection may vary from one disease to another, it is still needed to stop the disease. The most commonly used measures include isolation, vaccination, or confinement, which can affect the findings under consideration.
