Robotic surgery is an increasingly common component of surgical practice, yet it remains underrepresented in medical student education. While student interest in robotic surgery is high, their exposure is often informal and incidental.

To map the existing literature on robotic surgery curricula developed for medical students and to evaluate the extent to which these curricula align with Kern’s six-step framework for curriculum development.

A scoping review was conducted using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. Studies were included that focused on medical students and addressed one or more of Kern’s six curriculum development steps. Dual independent screening and consensus coding were used. Data were extracted and mapped to Kern’s framework.

Twenty-one studies were included, primarily small, single-institution pilots featuring the da Vinci surgical system. Most described technical skills training delivered via simulation. Few studies defined learning objectives and none addressed non-technical skills such as communication and teamwork. Implementation was limited with no evidence of long-term evaluation or curricula integration.

While robotic surgery curricula for medical students are feasible and valued, they remain in early stages of development. There is a need for structured, scalable and educationally grounded curricula that introduce foundational knowledge and support student readiness for technology-integrated surgical practice.

Robotic surgery is transforming operative care across numerous specialties. As this technology becomes increasingly integrated into surgical practice, it raises a fundamental question: should all medical students be exposed to robotic surgery, and if so, how? Some argue that all future doctors should develop foundational understanding, enough to safely participate in surgical teams and counsel patients [1]. Others argue that students should spend more time with people and less with robots [2].

This debate comes at a time of rapid change. Robotic platforms are proliferating, costs are falling and indications are expanding [3–8]. Robotic-assisted procedures are now routine across many surgical units, including in Australia, where graduate and undergraduate-entry programs train large and diverse cohorts. Yet most medical students remain unexposed to robotic systems or encounter them only passively [9,10]. Their knowledge is often self-directed or acquired by chance, and learning in the robotic theatre is described as demotivating [11].

What is striking is not just a lack of access, but a lack of intentional design [12]. While robotic training is increasingly available to surgical trainees and fellows [13], few programs have positioned medical students as the intended learners. Instead, students are often recruited as participants in simulator studies or curriculum validation [14–19]. This review takes the position that this represents a missed opportunity to engage, orient and prepare future doctors for the surgical environment where robotic systems are standard.

Importunately, this is not about teaching students to operate. It is about designing developmentally appropriate curricula that introduce core concepts, promote technological fluency and support broader professional growth. For Australian students, some of whom enter medicine directly from high school, early exposure may serve as a platform for exploration, motivation and informed career choice. Structured curricula can also support students in gaining non-technical skills essential to robotic care, such a situational awareness, communication and teamwork.

Despite strong student interest [20–23], efforts to implement robotic curricula at the medical student level remain fragmented. Most initiatives are institution-specific and focus heavily on technical simulation. There is limited guidance on curriculum content, delivery strategies, or alignment with student learning needs. A shared framework is required to guide this work.

This scoping review aimed to map existing literature on robotic surgical curricula developed for medical students, with a focus on how these initiatives align with Kern’s six-step framework for curriculum development [24]. Kern’s model (outlined in Fig.1) provides a structured, staged approach to curriculum design and served as an analytical framework to assess which components of the development process were addressed in existing literature.

Through this lens, we sought to clarify what currently exists, highlight gaps in curriculum structure and intent, and inform the future design of effective, level appropriate robotic surgical education at the medical student level.

Given the paucity of data on this topic, scoping review methodology was adopted. This review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The review protocol was developed in advance but was not registered.

Studies employing quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods approaches were included to capture diverse facets of medical student education.

A comprehensive literature search using the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Central Register of Controlled Trials. Manual citation chasing was also performed using the reference lists of included studies. The search was conducted in April 2024, with no restrictions applied to the earliest publication date.

Combined searches: Medical student terms were intersected with robotic surgery and surgical education terms using Boolean operators (e.g., AND/OR).

The full MEDLINE search strategy is provided in Appendix 1.

Two reviewers (J.E. and M.A.) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved records, followed by full-text assessments. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus.

A data charting form was jointly created to define the variables of interest. Each reviewer extracted data separately, after which they met to reconcile differences and finalise the results. Extracted data included general study characteristics, participant details, outcomes and educational themes. A template of this charting form can be found in Appendix 2.

Each study was then mapped to Kern’s [24] six steps for curriculum development: problem identification, targeted needs assessment, goals and specific objectives, educational strategies, implementation, evaluation and feedback. Key information relevant to informing a robotic surgical curriculum for medical students was highlighted under each domain.

The search strategy retrieved 1488 publications. After removing duplicates, 1209 titles and abstracts were screened. Of these, 106 full-text articles were reviewed and 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. No additional articles were identified through citating chasing (Fig.2).

Study designs included randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional surveys, qualitative research and one narrative description. There were no systematic reviews or meta analysis. One study “Perception of robotic-assisted surgery among medical students: a systematic review and meta-analysis” [25], was excluded as its analysis focused exclusively on residents and fellows. Most studies were small, single-institution initiatives focusing on the da Vinci surgical system or related simulators.

Several studies identified a disconnect between the increasing prevalence of robotic surgery in clinical practice and its limited representation in medical school curricula [1–5]. This disparity was described as a pressing issue by both students and educators [9,10]. Students reported having little formal exposure and acquiring knowledge opportunistically [9]. Higgins et al. [11] noted that the robotic operating room was often perceived as an unwelcoming and passive learning environment.

At the same time, students demonstrated strong enthusiasm for learning about robotic surgery and a clear desire for structured educational opportunities [21,22,26]. This tension between motivation and lack of access emerged as a key theme across studies, supporting the need for formalised, level-appropriate curriculum.

Only a few studies explicitly articulated learning goals. These included orienting students to robotic technology [27], developing an understanding of clinical applications [27,28] and equipping students with sufficient knowledge to make appropriate referrals in future practice [9]. In Mullens et al. [27], the curriculum was also intended to prepare students for subsequent resident-level training.

These interventions were shown to expediate learning and improve technical performance among novice users.

Studies by Greenberg et al. [28] and Moglia et al. [39] demonstrate that robotic curricula can be feasibly implemented for medical students, even on a small scale. Students expressed high satisfaction with hands-on, clinically relevant teaching and showed improved preparedness to participate in robotic operating rooms [28].

Despite these positive findings, most curricula were pilot programs limited to a single site. Kalinov et al. [40] reported positive student feedback and skill improvement, but no studies demonstrated large-scale implementation or long-term integration into formal curricula.

Collectively, these studies suggest that robotic surgery is a relevant and engaging area of interest for medical students. However, current offerings remain fragmented, short-term and heavily skewed towards technical simulation. Curriculum content and goals are inconsistently defined and non-technical skills such as communication and team-based competence, remain largely unaddressed.

Multimodal, experiential teaching formats appear most effective, particularly when combined with feedback, peer interaction and performance review. The feasibility of small-scale implementation has been demonstrated, yet broader integration will require institutional support, faculty involvement and alignment with curricular priorities.

Robotic surgery is transforming operative care across multiple specialties at an unprecedented pace. However, this technological revolution is not adequately reflected in medical student education. While prior research has examined robotic training for surgical residents and fellows [13] our review highlights a noticeable gap. Medical students remain underrepresented as the primary learners in robotic surgical curricula. This is despite their clear recognition of robotic surgery as a central element of future practice and their expressed eagerness to engage with the technology early in training. This disconnect, where students are engaged and eager yet not positioned as the intended learners, represents a missed opportunity to cultivate early surgical interest, foster foundational understanding and prepare future doctors for technology-integrated clinical practice. Medical students feature prominently in the literature on robotic surgical education, but their involvement is often instrumental rather than intentional. Numerous studies enlist students to characterise simulator learning curves [16], assess virtual reality training platforms [14,15], or validate curricula designed for residents and fellows [17–19]. While this provides valuable insight into educational technologies, it unconsciously positions students as proxies in research rather than as learners in their own right. This was not unreasonable as early efforts in robotic education necessarily focused on upskilling practicing surgeons and subspecialty trainees as the technology was first adopted. However, as robotic surgery becomes increasingly embedded in routine surgical care, the educational focus must evolve. It is now both timely and essential to reimagine medical students as primary learners, and to develop dedicated curricula that align with their learning needs, clinical responsibilities, and professional aspirations. This imperative is particularly relevant in the Australian context, where medical programs include both undergraduate-entry and graduate-entry pathways. As a result, students may begin training with varying levels of clinical exposure and career clarity. Structured, student-focused curricula in robotic surgery can offer a valuable platform for early exploration, foundational learning, and technological literacy. These goals differ from those prioritised in graduate-entry models, such as those in the United States.

The majority of existing robotic surgery curricula are designed with technical skill acquisition in mind. These often emphasise console time, suturing and knot-tying, which reflects the performance needs of surgical trainees and fellows [41]. However, this emphasis is less appropriate for medical students. Our review found little guidance on what learning objectives are appropriate for this cohort. Most interventions describe general exposure, orientation to the robotic platform, or basic psychomotor tasks [27–29]. While technical activities can be engaging, they may overlook broader learning goals. A student-focused curriculum should aim to build foundational understanding, spark interest, and increase comfort with robotic systems. This includes preparing students to explain robotic surgery to patients, understand the challenges, risks and benefits and feel confident in a robotic operating room. Training should align with their level of responsibility and help situate robotic surgery within the wider context of surgical care.

Many studies included in this review demonstrate that medical students can meaningfully engage with robotic surgery through structured simulation. Educational strategies such as abbreviated simulation protocols [42], active observation [31,35], video review [38], contemporaneous feedback [37] and expert facilitation [30] have all proven effective in enhancing technical skill acquisition among students. These approaches offer scalable and efficient options that align with modern surgical education.

Technical proficiency alone is insufficient for safe robotic practice. Robotic surgery introduces unique challenges. Notably, the physical separation of the surgeon from the patient and the operative team. This disrupts traditional communication, reduces non-verbal cues, and alters team dynamics. Human factors training has therefore become an increasingly important component of robotic surgery curricula for residents and fellows. A systematic review by Mahendran et al. [43] highlighted that robotic-assisted procedures demand heightened situational awareness, clear communication, and effective teamwork. These skills are often underdeveloped yet critically linked to patient safety. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh has similarly emphasised the need for graduated training programs that integrate non-technical skills from the outset of robotic training [44]. Despite these advances, our review found no evidence that such competencies are addressed in reference to medical students. Medical students must not only gain foundational technical understanding but also begin to develop the professional behaviours and human factors that support safe surgical practice. Importantly, integrating human factors into a robotic surgery curriculum also offers a valuable opportunity to introduce these universally relevant skills to all future clinicians, not only those pursuing surgical careers. Simulation-based education, particularly when delivered in immersive scenarios with structured debriefing, remains the most effective method to teach these non-technical skills [45] and should be a priority in any medical student-focused robotic curriculum.

Several studies demonstrate that robotic surgery curricula for medical students are feasible and well-received [10,28]. However, these efforts remain largely limited to single-institution pilots without widespread curricular integration or standardisation. Within Kern’s framework for curriculum development, these initiatives address early steps such as identifying learner needs and trialling educational strategies, but there is no literature demonstrating a progression to sustained implementation or evaluation. This reflects a broader challenge in surgical education. That is translating innovation into sustainable, curriculum-wide change. The enthusiasm expressed by medical students [21,22,46] and their preference for hands-on, active learning [28] create a receptive environment, yet this interest must be met with institutional commitment. Embedding robotic surgery within the medical student curriculum will require more than access to a simulator. It demands faculty buy in, dedicated teaching time and alignment with existing clinical learning objectives.

As robotic surgery becomes a routine feature of surgical care, there is a risk that medical students will be left behind. Early exposure to robotic technology has been shown to increase confidence, clinical readiness, and interest in a surgical career [23]. These benefits extend beyond those pursuing surgery. Understanding robotic procedures helps all medical students counsel patients, engage in interprofessional teamwork, and feel prepared for modern surgical environments [47]. However, access to robotic education remains unbalanced. Robotic systems are expensive and simulation tools are often prioritised for vocational training. Without deliberate planning, this may deepen disparities between institutions, creating unjust learning opportunities based on geography or available resources.

Comprehensive training on robotic surgery is still lacking and needs greater prioritisation. A validated, structured curriculum for surgical trainees has yet to be established. Many registrars report limited access to robotic platforms and inadequate intraoperative teaching during their training years [1,2]. In this context, the idea of stretching limited resources to include medical students is often met with scepticism from hospitals, faculty, and even industry partners [1,2]. However, advances in simulation, virtual reality, and telepresence platforms like Proximie offer scalable, low-risk opportunities for student learning [48]. These tools reduce reliance on theatre access and allow students to gain foundational understanding without competing with trainees for operative time. Rather than diluting training, incorporating students may actually enrich the learning environment, normalising the technology and fostering a culture of curiosity, collaboration and technological literacy from the earliest stages of clinical education.

This scoping review has several limitations. First, only studies published in English were included, which may have excluded relevant non-English literature. Second, as is standard in scoping review methodology, no formal assessment of study quality was performed. This limits the ability to evaluate the robustness of the included evidence. Third, most studies were small, single-institution pilots and varied considerably in structure, content, and outcome measures. This heterogeneity limited direct comparisons and made it difficult to identify best practices. Additionally, there is a risk of publication bias, as unpublished curricula or institutional programs without peer-reviewed evaluation may have been missed. Despite these limitations, this review provides a valuable overview of the current state of robotic surgery education for medical students and highlights critical gaps and opportunities for future curriculum development.

Robotic surgery is rapidly becoming a standard component of surgical care. However, medical education has yet to reflect this shift in a consistent or structured way. While early pilot programs demonstrate that robotic curricula for medical students are feasible, acceptable and educationally valuable, these efforts remain limited and disconnected. There is strong interest among students and increasing support in the literature for structured, student-focused curricula. To move forward, institutions must invest not only in simulation access but also in faculty development and curriculum design. Early exposure to robotic systems offers an opportunity to build foundational knowledge, foster non-technical skills, and inspire the next generation of clinicians, regardless of their chosen specialty. By engaging students at this stage, we can better prepare the next generation of doctors for a future where robotic surgery is routine clinical practice. This review underscores the need for a coordinated, evidence-informed approach to integrating robotic surgery into medical student education.
