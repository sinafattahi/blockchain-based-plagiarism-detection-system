Reactive stroma plays a pivotal role in the genesis, progression, and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). Higher reactive stromal grade (RSG) generally portends a poorer prognosis. The aim of the study is non-invasively evaluate RSG by preoperative mono-exponential model, stretch-exponent model (SEM) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and isolate the independent predictor of high RSG (> 50% reactive stroma) in parameters of mono-exponential model, SEM and DKI.

Totally, 54 low RSG (≤ 50% reactive stroma) patients and 26 high RSG patients were prospectively enrolled in the study. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusivity (MD), distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC), and heterogeneity index (α) values of all lesions were measured on GE Workstation 4.6. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was used to analysis the correlation between RSG and parameters of SEM and DKI. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of those parameters in differentiating low RSG and high RSG. DeLong’s test was used to assess whether the differences of AUC for each parameter were statistically significant. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of high RSG.

ADC (r= − 0.352,p= 0.001), DDC (r= − 0.579,p< 0.001) and MD (r= − 0.597,p< 0.001) values showed significant negative correlations with RSG, while MK value (r= 0.658,p< 0.001) demonstrated a significant positive correlation. MK (AUC = 0.816,p< 0.001) was superior to ADC (AUC = 0.717,p< 0.001), DDC (AUC = 0.781,p< 0.001) and MD (AUC = 0.774,p< 0.001) in differentiating low and high RSG, but the differences between these AUCs were not statistically significant (allp> 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant model (χ² =43.222,p< 0.001), and showed that MK (odds ratio = 10.185; 95% CI: 2.467 ~ 21.694;p< 0.001) and MD (odds ratio = 0.014; 95% CI: 0.003 ~ 0.367;p< 0.001) were the independent predictors of high RSG.

Although ADC, DDC, and MD values were significantly negatively correlated with RSG, and MK was significantly positively correlated, and all three models—mono-exponential model, SEM, and DKI—demonstrated good performance in differentiating between low and high RSG, only parameters MD and MK values of DKI were identified as independent predictors of high RSG.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors among men worldwide [1]. In recent years, the incidence of PCa has been increasing annually, partly due to the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening [2,3]. Evidence indicates that the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate following surgery is significantly higher in prognostic grade group (PGG) 2 (Gleason 3 + 4) patients compared to PGG 3 (Gleason 4 + 3) patients, 88% (95% CI, 85–89) and 63% (95% CI, 61–65), respectively [4,5].

Reactive stroma, a microenvironment adjacent to epithelial cells, orchestrates a multitude of processes including homeostatic alterations, wound healing, and interactions with neoplastic complexes, playing a pivotal role in the genesis, progression, and metastasis of PCa. The evolving characteristics of reactive stroma during tumorigenesis encompass an augmentation of stromal cells such as fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, a remodeling of the extracellular matrix including collagen fibers and fibronectin, as well as angiogenesis and immune cell infiltration [6]. Reactive stroma grading (RSG) is employed to quantify and evaluate the distribution and abundance of these stromal components, thereby assessing the alterations in the tumor microenvironment and their potential impact on tumor behavior [7,8]. A higher RSG generally portends a poorer prognosis. Patients with PCa exhibiting high RSG (> 50% reactive stroma) tend to have shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival compared to those with low RSG (≤ 50% reactive stroma) [9]. Currently, there is a lack of research on the non-invasive preoperative assessment of RSG [9].

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), by measuring the diffusion motion of water molecules within biological tissues, indirectly reflects microscopic structural alterations, thereby providing a non-invasive approach for assessing tissue structural characteristics. In the detection and evaluation of PCa, DWI has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, particularly showing marked advantages for identifying lesions located in the peripheral zone [10,11]. However, tumor tissues frequently exhibit diverse cellular arrangements, complex stromal compositions, and structural heterogeneity, resulting in non-Gaussian diffusion behavior of water molecules. Consequently, conventional DWI often fail to adequately reflect this complex microscopic environment. In contrast, advanced diffusion models such as the stretched-exponential model (SEM) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) can effectively capture non-Gaussian diffusion phenomena, thus providing a more comprehensive characterization of tumor microstructural properties. Several studies have indicated that both SEM and DKI exhibit substantial potential for evaluating PCa aggressiveness, demonstrating promising clinical applicability [12–14]. Parameter distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) of the SEM can effectively differentiate between benign prostatic hyperplasia and PCa, and DDC value exhibit a significant negative correlation with Gleason pattern in assessing PCa aggressiveness [15]. What’s more, parameters mean diffusivity (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK) of DKI could effectively differentiate PGG 2 and PGG 3 [16].

The aim of the study was to clarify whether RSG differ between PGG 2 and PGG 3. Furthermore, the study attempted to use SEM and DKI to noninvasively evaluate RSG preoperatively, and to compare the diagnostic efficacy of SEM and DKI for high RSG.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University. From December 2019 to June 2023, we prospectively enrolled 97 PCa patients, including 65 low RSG patients and 32 high RSG patients. Exclusion criteria: (1) patients underwent prostate biopsy within 6 weeks before prostate MRI (Reducing post biopsy changes, including hemorrhage and inflammation, may adversely affect the interpretation of prostate MRI) (n= 7); (2) radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy prior to prostate mpMRI (n= 6); (3) the prostate mpMRI have artifacts, which affect the assessment(n= 4). Finally, 80 PCa patients were enrolled in this study, including 54 low RSG patients and 26 high RSG patients.

Each participant was subjected to a prostate MRI examination utilizing a 3.0 T MRI system (GE Discovery MR 750 W) equipped with an eight-channel phased-array coil. According to Prostate Imaging–Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Version 2.1, the prostate MRI scanning sequence included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), DWI and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging MRI (DCE-MRI) [11]. SEM imaging parameters were [17]: repetition time (TR) / echo time (TE), 3500/87.5 milliseconds; slice thickness, 3.0 mm; space, 0.5 mm; field of view (FOV), 24 × 24 cm; acquisition matrix, 256 × 224; 11 b values (b values [number of excitations], 0 [1], 25 [1], 50 [1], 75 [1], 100 [4], 150 [4], 200 [6], 400 [8], 800 [10], 1200 [12] and 2000 [14] s/mm2) were employed. Parameters of DKI [16]: TR/TE, 3800/87.4 milliseconds; slice thickness, 3 mm; space, 0.5 mm; FOV, 24 × 24 cm; matrix, 256 × 224; with 15 gradient directions and five b values (b values [number of excitations], 0 [1], 500 [2], 1000 [4], 1500 [6], 2000 [8] s/mm²). Details showed in Table1.

All prostate MRI assessments adhered to the recommendations of PI-RADS version 2.1 [11]. Two radiologists (DM. L., with 10 years of experience in abdominal imaging diagnosis; KP. Z., with 7 years of experience in abdominal imaging diagnosis) jointly evaluated the prostate MRI while blinded to the patients’ laboratory data and results from ancillary imaging examination results (such as ultrasound). In cases where there was a discrepancy in the diagnostic conclusions, a third senior radiologist (QY. L., with more than 15 years of experience in abdominal imaging) was consulted to reach a final consensus.

The parameter maps of SEM and DKI were reconstructed on a GE AW 4.6 workstation. Firstly, region of interest (ROI) was drawn along the lesion outline at the largest slice on T2WI or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (If the lesion was located in peripheral zone, ADC map was referred. If the lesion was located in transitional zone, T2WI was referenced). Subsequently, the ROI was copied onto the related parameter maps of SEM and DKI for measurement.

All patients underwent radical prostatectomy performed by experienced urologic surgeons. Following surgery, the excised prostate specimens containing prostate cancer were immediately fixed in formalin. After paraffin embedding, serial sections were obtained at 3 mm intervals from the apex to the base of the prostate. All sections were subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological evaluation. To ensure optimal correspondence between the imaging-based ROI measurement slice and the histopathological evaluation slice, the following procedure was used for RSG assessment. First, the largest cross-sectional area of the lesion was identified on axial T2WI or ADC map, and a ROI was delineated on that slice. Next, the vertical distance from this slice to the apex of the prostate was measured on sagittal T2WI and recorded as D (in millimeters). Finally, based on the measured distance D and the pathological sectioning interval of 3 mm, the corresponding histological slice number was estimated to identify the appropriate section for RSG evaluation.

Pathological assessment of each specimen was independently conducted by two pathologists (both K. G. and J. X., with more than 10 years of experience in pathological diagnosis), who blind to the magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Discrepancies between the evaluations were reconciled through consensus. The reactive stroma appears pale pink, exhibits fibrosis, and has a disorganized arrangement, with stromal cells characterized by elongated nuclei and scant cytoplasm. RSG was classified into four grades: Grade 0 (0% ~ 5% reactive stroma), Grade 1 (6% ~ 15% reactive stroma), Grade 2 (16% ~ 50% reactive stroma), and Grade 3 (51% ~ 100% reactive stroma or a gland-to-stroma ratio of at least 1:1) [9,18]. Patients were divided into high RSG group (> 50% reactive stroma) and low RSG group (≤ 50% reactive stroma).

In the study, the normality and homogeneity of continuous variances were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene’s test, respectively. Clinical characteristics of patients were compared between low RSG and high RSG, continuous variances were compared by independent samplet-test, and categorical variances were compared by Fisher’s exact test or χ2 test. Independent samplet-test was used to analyze the differences of parameters of mono-exponential model, SEM and DKI between between low RSG and high RSG. To analysis the correlation between RSG and parameters of mono-exponential model, SEM and DKI, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was used. To evaluate diagnostic performance and identify optimal cut-off values for the prediction of high RSG, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used and the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated. Subsequently, the DeLong’s test was used to assess whether the differences of AUC for each parameter were statistically significant. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of high RSG from parameters derived from the mono-exponential model, SEM, and DKI. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (v. 27.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL) and Medcalc (V. 22.0; MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 80 PCa patients were included in the study, among which 54 were low RSG patients (Fig.1), and 26 were high RSG patients (Fig.2). In PGG 2, 29 cases were classified as low RSG, while 7 cases were high RSG. In contrast, PGG 3 included 25 cases with low RSG and 19 cases with high RSG. Chi-square analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of RSG between PGG 2 and PGG 3 (p= 0.024), indicating a potential association between higher RSG and more advanced PGG. The detailed clinical characteristics are shown in Table2.

Spearman’s rank correlation analysis showed that MK value (r= 0.658,p< 0.001) had a moderate positive correlation with RSG, whereas MD value (r= − 0.597,p< 0.001) and DDC value (r= − 0.579,p< 0.001) had moderate negative correlations with RSG. ADC value (r= − 0.352,p= 0.001) had low negative correlations with RSG. However, 𝛼 value (r= 0.037,p= 0.743) only exhibited a low positive correlation with RSG, which was not statistically significant.

Compared with low RSG PCa, high RSG PCa had a higher MK value (0.567 ± 0.079 vs. 0.656 ± 0.061), had a lower MD value (0.873 ± 0.128 × 10-³ mm²/s vs. 0.752 ± 0.077 × 10-³ mm²/s), DDC value (0.693 ± 0.095 × 10-³ mm²/s vs. 0.603 ± 0.071 × 10-³ mm²/s) and ADC value (1.064 ± 0.176 × 10-³ mm²/s vs. 0.926 ± 0.159 × 10-³ mm²/s). Results of independent samples t-test showed that the differences in MK (t = − 5.021,p< 0.001), MD (t = 4.442,p< 0.001), DDC (t = 4.257,p< 0.001) and ADC (t = 3.395,p= 0.001) values between low RSG and high RSG were statistically significant. However, the difference in 𝛼 values between low RSG (0.565 ± 0.199) and high RSG (0.595 ± 0.201) have no statistically significance (p= 0.541). The details are shown in Table3.

Results of ROC curve analysis showed that MK, MD, DDC and ADC values could effectively differentiate high RSG and low RSG, AUCMK=0.816 (p< 0.001;), AUCMD=0.774 (p< 0.001), AUCDDC=0.781 (p< 0.001) and AUCADC=0.717 (p< 0.001), respectively. When MK value ≥ 0.638, the sensitivity and specificity were 69.23% and 81.48%, respectively. For MD value ≤ 0.852 × 10-³ mm²/s, the sensitivity and specificity were 91.15% and 55.56%, respectively. When the cut-off for the DDC value was set at 0.657 × 10-³ mm²/s, the sensitivity and specificity were 84.62% and 66.67%, respectively. When the cut-off for the ADC value was set at 0.855 × 10-³ mm²/s, the sensitivity and specificity were 46.15% and 88.89%, respectively. The details are shown in Fig.3and Table4. Although MK value had a higher AUC compared to MD value, DDC value and ADC value, but the differences have no statistically significance (allp> 0.05). The details are shown in Table5.

Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant model (χ² =43.222,p< 0.001) with an overall accuracy of 80.00% in predicting high RSG. The model yielded a sensitivity of 70.83%, specificity of 83.93%, positive predictive value of 65.39%, and negative predictive value of 87.04%. Among the evaluated parameters, MK (odds ratio = 10.185; 95% CI: 2.467 ~ 21.694;p< 0.001) and MD (odds ratio = 0.014; 95% CI: 0.003 ~ 0.367;p< 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of high RSG. The details are shown in Table6.

The study demonstrated the role of quantitative mono-exponential model, SEM and DKI parameters for intratumor RSG in PGG 2 and PGG 3 prostate cancer patients. In particular, ADC, DDC, MK, and MD values and their combinations were able to distinguish high and low RSG groups. However, only MK and MD values were independent risk factors for high RSG.

Previous studies have demonstrated that both the parameter DDC value of SEM and the parameter MD value of DKI exhibit similarities to the ADC value of the mono-exponential model, and they are negatively correlated with the Gleason pattern of PCa. In contrast, MK value, which reflects the non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion within tissues, exhibits a positive correlation with tumor aggressiveness [10,15,19]. Our findings are consistent with these studies: compared to low RSG group, high RSG group exhibited a significantly lower ADC, DDC, and MD values, and a higher MK value.

As RSG increases, the stromal reactivity becomes more pronounced [7,8], leading to increased diffusion restriction and larger diffusion peak of water molecule within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, results of Hectors et al. [12] showed that, key contributors to restricted water diffusion in tissues include nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, cell density, and stromal complexity. This may partly explain why high RSG is associated with lower DDC and MD values and higher MK value compared to low RSG. Previous studies have shown that with an increase of Gleason pattern, the volume of low-diffusion epithelial cells increases, while the volume of high-diffusion stroma and lumens decreases [20,21]. This results in lower DDC and MD values and higher MK value in PGG 3 tumor compared to PGG 2 tumor. Notably, in our study, the proportion of PGG 3 in high RSG PCa was significantly higher than that in low RSG PCa. This may provide another explanation for the observed lower DDC and MD values and higher MK value in the high RSG compared to the low RSG.

RSG is a key factor in PCa progression and resistance, and higher RSG is associated with increased biochemical recurrence rate [7,9,22]. Our findings showed that the feasibility of using mono-exponential model, SEM and DKI for non-invasive evaluation of RSG. Although MK demonstrated the highest AUC (0.816) compared to ADC, DDC, and MD, the differences in diagnostic performance among these parameters for identifying high RSG were not statistically significant. Some studies have reported that, compared to the mono-exponential model, neither SEM nor DKI provides additional diagnostic value in assessing the Gleason score of PCa [10,13–16]. However, conflicting evidence exists; such as, studies by Fukunaga and Ding et al. [17,23]. have suggested that SEM and DKI offer superior diagnostic performance in this context.

The reactive stroma in PCa primarily consists of tumor-associated fibroblasts, immune cells, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels within the tumor microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts play a critical role in tumor stromal remodeling by promoting fibrosis and enhancing the accumulation of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, which increases the complexity of the tumor stroma [24–26]. These histological changes lead to a deviation from Gaussian diffusion behavior within prostate cancer tissues. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that parameters MK and MD values of DKI were independent predictors of high RSG. In contrast, parameters of SEM and mono-exponential model were not statistically significant.

Notably, our study observed no significant correlation between the parameter α value of SEM and RSG, with no statistically significant differences detected between low RSG and high RSG. Although previous studies have demonstrated the diagnostic value of α value in distinguishing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from PCa [27], this may be attributed to the more complex microstructural characteristics of PCa tissue, such as higher tumor cellularity, reduced glandular lumen structure, and compressed extracellular spaces. However, several studies have reported that a lack of significant association between the α value and Gleason pattern [15], and our results keep line with the previous studies. This suggests that the microstructural differences reflected by both the Gleason system and the RSG may not have reached the sensitivity threshold required for the α value detection.

There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, this was a single-center retrospective study with a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further validation using multicenter datasets with larger cohorts is warranted. Secondly, an imbalance in sample size between the low and high RSG groups may have reduced the statistical power of the analysis and increased the risk of model overfitting. Thirdly, given the heterogeneous nature of RSG, histogram- or texture-based imaging feature analysis may offer greater diagnostic value than mean value–based measurements. However, due to limitations in research conditions, we were unable to perform such advanced analyses in this study and instead relied on mean parameter extraction. This methodological constraint may have limited the comprehensiveness of our imaging-based evaluation of RSG. Fourthly, Due to the small volume of some lesions, which were visible on only a single axial slice of the T2WI or ADC map, it was not feasible to accurately delineate their full 3D volume. To ensure methodological consistency across the entire cohort, ROI analysis was performed on the axial slice showing the largest cross-sectional area of the lesion. However, this single-slice approach may have limited our ability to fully capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor and its associated stroma.

The study demonstrated that ADC, DDC, and MD values were significantly negatively correlated with RSG, while MK was significantly positively correlated. Although mono-exponential model, SEM, and DKI all showed good performance in distinguishing between low and high RSG, only parameters MD and MK values of DKI were identified as independent predictors of high RSG. These findings suggest that DKI provides superior diagnostic performance compared to the mono-exponential model and SEM, and may serve as a promising noninvasive approach for assessing RSG in PCa.
