This study aimed to investigate the impact of physical activity (PA) on emotional management ability (EMA) in college students and to analyze the chain mediating roles of psychological resilience (PR) and health literacy (HL) in the relationship between PA and EMA.

Demographic information was collected using a stratified, cluster, and multi-stage sampling method. Data on PA, PR, HL, and EMA among college students were collected using an online questionnaire. A total of 13,590 valid questionnaires were obtained.

A significant positive correlation was found between PA and EMA in college students (r= 0.177,P< 0.01). PR and HL played significant mediating roles in the relationship between PA and EMA. The mediation effect consisted of independent mediation by PR and HL and a chain mediation effect between the two. The values of the independent mediation effects and the chain mediation effect were 0.011, 0.010, and 0.004, respectively. The chain mediation effect was lower than each of the individual mediation effects and showed a statistically significant difference compared to the mediation effect of HL (P< 0.05).

PA significantly enhances college students’ EMA through direct effects and a chain mediation pathway involving PR and HL. Coordinated interventions, including regular exercise, PR training, and health education, are recommended to optimize college students’ psychological health.

Emotional management ability (EMA) encompasses an individual’s capacity to effectively recognize, comprehend, modulate, and express emotional states [1]. EMA has a significant impact on the growth and development of college students [2]. College students experience rapid psychological changes and significant emotional fluctuations [3]. Poor EMA can make it difficult for them to cope with the pressures of life and study, thereby increasing the risk of psychological health problems [4]. Long-term emotional distress can lead to problems such as sleep disorders and eating disorders [5]. Psychological health issues are prevalent and can lead to a series of negative consequences [6]. Negative emotions not only seriously affect the physical and psychological health of college students but may also lead to self-harm or suicidal behavior [7]. Therefore, exploring the factors that affect college students’ EMA is significant. Students with strong EMA can adjust their emotional state promptly when facing negative emotions, maintaining their physical and psychological health [8]. They can better cope with stress and timely relieve tense and depressive psychological states [9]. The cognitive function of students who are in a long-term state of negative emotions may be impaired [10]. In severe cases, even suicidal tendencies may develop [11]. EMA has now become a focus of global psychological research [12]. The more positive and less negative emotions an individual has, the happier they are [13]. Emotion is the core driving force of individual behavior, and Physical activity (PA) plays an important role in forming good psychological qualities [14]. However, research on how PA influences college students’ EMA through mediating mechanisms is still insufficient. Based on an understanding of EMA, we considered the influencing factors of PA.

PA is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle contraction that substantially increases energy expenditure [15]. PA is an integral part of a healthy lifestyle, and sufficient PA is a key factor in improving the quality of life [16–18]. With social development, people’s PA levels are trending downwards. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 27.5% of the global population failed to meet the recommended PA levels outlined in its Global Status Report on PA [19,20]. Among university students, PA manifests in various forms and can be categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-intensity levels [21]. Studies have demonstrated that moderate-to-vigorous PA is associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of experiencing anxiety and depression [22]. Research indicates a significant difference in psychological health status between university students who engage in sporadic PA and those who participate regularly, with the former exhibiting a higher prevalence of various psychological problems compared to the latter [23]. Regular and moderate PA effectively reduces negative effects and contributes to emotional regulation and the maintenance of mental well-being [24,25].

Psychological resilience (PR) was first proposed by American psychologist Emmy [26], which refers to an individual’s resilience in the face of adversity, setbacks, and other difficult situations, covering trauma, negative life events, life stress, illness, family and social influences, etc [27], is an individual’s ability or trait to cope with stress, setbacks, and trauma [28]. There is a significant positive correlation between PR and EMA, and effective emotion regulation can be a key way to enhance PR [29]. It also has a significant contributing effect on PR [30]. Training can effectively enhance and improve an individual’s PR [31]. It has been shown that PR is a significant positive predictor of adolescents’ subjective well-being [32]. Studies have shown that PR is negatively correlated with psychological health indicators (e.g., depression, anxiety, and negative emotions) and positively correlated with positive indicators of negative psychological health (e.g., life satisfaction, positive emotions, etc.) [33]. Individuals with strong PR can manage their negative emotions more effectively, maintain a positive attitude toward life, and thus significantly improve their quality of life [34]. Therefore, good PR contributes to university students’ EMA, adaptability, and positive cognitive attitudes [35].

Health literacy (HL) refers to the ability of individuals to obtain, comprehend, and utilize basic health information and services to make informed health decisions for promoting and maintaining personal well-being [36–39]. Individuals’ HL is strongly associated with PA levels, with higher HL significantly increasing participation in PA and positively affecting psychological health [40]. HL is a significant predictor of increased EMA [41]. HL is a health determinant that can improve health, empower individuals, and reduce health inequalities [42]. HL Level refers to the proportion of people with basic HL in the total surveyed population. It is a comprehensive indicator reflecting socio-economic development and the health level of the population. In 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued and implemented the “Outline of the “Healthy China 2030” Plan,” which set the improvement of the level of HL of the whole population as one of the strategic objectives [43]. As the backbone of the country’s future development and society, college students are the key participants in realizing the strategy of Healthy China. Therefore, it is extremely important to improve the HL level of college students [44]. Based on Kickbusch’s theory of social determinants of HL, this study focuses on the acculturation differences of ethnic minority groups, which forms a theoretical echo of the concept of health equity put forward in the “Healthy China 2030” Planning Outline [42].

Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory offers a framework for understanding how positive emotions facilitate the expansion of cognitive and behavioral repertoires, which, in turn, contribute to the accumulation of psychological, social, and physical resources, creating an upward spiral towards enhanced well-being [45]. To substantiate the proposed serial mediation model, we draw upon Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory. Evidence suggests that PA promotes positive affect. Broaden-and-Build Theory posits that PA, through the generation of positive emotions, broadens individuals’ cognitive and behavioral repertoires (e.g., PR) and facilitates the accumulation of long-term psychological resources (e.g., HL), ultimately contributing to improved EMA. This mechanism is consistent with our study’s findings, which support a serial mediation pathway from PA to PR/HL and, subsequently, to EMA. The social cognitive theory was proposed by Bandura, which emphasizes that an individual’s behavior is influenced by the interplay of personal factors, the behavior itself, and environmental factors, and provides a framework for understanding behavior as a product of dynamic and reciprocal interactions among personal, behavioral, and environmental factors through triadic reciprocal causation [46]. EMA is closely related to psychological health, and PA is not only beneficial to physical health, but it also plays a pivotal role in psychological health and the ability to manage emotions. The enhancement of HL is closely linked to emotional, physical, and psychological well-being. Generally speaking, more mentally resilient individuals tend to have excellent EMA and higher HL and can cope with many life challenges more easily. The research in this paper is based on social cognitive theory. In this study, social cognitive theory can help explain how PA affects college students’ emotion management abilities through two mediating variables: PR and HL. This paper aims to comprehensively explore the mechanism of PA’s influence on college students’ EMA and to provide theoretical support and practical suggestions for improving college students’ mental and physical health. Prior research has established positive correlations between physical activity, emotion regulation, psychological resilience, and health literacy. Engaging in appropriate PA can effectively foster positive emotional states [47]. Furthermore, psychological resilience and health literacy have been shown to mediate the relationship between physical activity and emotion regulation [48,49]. Individuals with higher levels of psychological resilience tend to exhibit greater health literacy, as resilience fosters the development of adaptive coping strategies and enhances the ability to effectively understand and utilize health information, ultimately leading to lower levels of health-related anxiety. Currently, research on PR is experiencing a notable increase, but research exploring the relationship between PR and HL remains limited. This study fills this research void by establishing their chain mediation effect in the context of PA and EMA. Our study is a cross-sectional one, which cannot establish causality but merely serves as a data-based inference.

Physical activity is positively associated with emotion management ability.

Psychological resilience mediates the positive relationship between physical activity and emotion management ability.

Health literacy mediates the positive relationship between physical activity and emotion management ability.

This study utilized data from the “Chinese College Students Physical Activity and Health Longitudinal Survey” (CPAHLS-CS) 2024. The CPAHLS-CS aims to collect a set of high-quality microdata on PA and health behaviors representing Chinese college students to analyze the cross-related field of PA and the health of college students in China and promote interdisciplinary research on college students’ health issues. CPAHLS-CS has been widely used to analyze the health status of Chinese college students. The participants in this study were undergraduate students enrolled in regular higher education institutions in mainland China. The recruitment period for the study spanned from 08/10/2024 to 09/11/2024, with the subsequent questionnaire survey being conducted from 11/11/2024 to 24/11/2024. The list of regular institutions of higher education was based on the “National List of Regular Institutions of Higher Education (as of June 20, 2024)” published by the Ministry of Education. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) Questionnaires with unidentifiable full names of schools were removed. (2) Questionnaires with at least 21 identical consecutive entries were removed. (3) Remove questionnaires whose completion time fell into (0, 0.5%) and (99.5%, 100%), given that the average completion time was 6 min and 12 s. A total of 13,590 valid questionnaires were included in the final analysis. The distribution of participants is shown in Table1.

PA of college students in this study was measured using the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3) in Simplified Chinese, which was compiled by a Japanese scholar, Kimio Hashimoto, and revised by Liang et al. The Chinese scale version was reliable and valid for the Chinese adolescent population. PA was examined in terms of three dimensions: intensity, frequency, and duration of a workout session, and each dimension contained five options to measure the level of PA participation. In the specific questionnaire completion, the higher the survey score indicated a higher level of PA, which, to a certain extent, reflected the sports participation behavior of college students at a specific time. The raw scores obtained from the questionnaire measurements were calculated using formula (1).

According to the normative rating scale for Chinese adults on the PARS-3, scores of ≤ 19 points indicated small exercise, 20~42 points indicated medium exercise and ≥ 43 points indicated large exercise. The scale had a retest reliability of 0.820 [50].

To assess the emotional management abilities of university students in this study, we utilized the Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS), a measure developed by Mayer and Salovey in 1998 based on their emotional intelligence theory. The Chinese version of the EIS, translated and adapted by Wang in 2002, was employed to quantify participants’ capacities in perceiving, understanding, expressing, controlling, managing, and utilizing emotions in themselves and others. The scale examines in four dimensions: the ability to perceive emotions, the ability to promote thinking through emotions, the ability to understand emotions, and the ability to manage emotions. The scale employs a 33-item Likert format, with each item rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1, which signifies strongly disagree, to 5, which signifies strongly agree. A total score was then calculated [1]. The total score ranged from 33 to 165. The higher the total score of the EIS, the higher the individual’s self-emotional management level [51]. Since then, scholars in China have widely used and validated the EIS [52]. The EIS has been validated in several studies for its applicability in the Chinese college student population [53,54]. The Chinese scale version demonstrates good reliability and validity, specifically, a Cronbach’s α of 0.84 [55].

The PR of college students in this study was measured using the Adolesce Psychological Resilience Scale developed by Hu. The scale consists of 27 questions across five dimensions: goal focus, emotional control, positive cognition, family support, and interpersonal assistance, and is scored on a 5-point scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1, which signifies strongly disagree, to 5, and the total score ranges from 27 to 135 points. In the present study, we used the “Emotional Control” subscale [56]. The mean score of all items on the subscale was calculated, with higher scores indicating greater PR. According to Smith et al. (2008), the Cronbach’s α coefficient of the Brief Resilience Scale was 0.80, indicating that the scale has a high internal consistency reliability [57].

In this study, the Chinese version of the HLS-SF9 (Health Literacy Scale-Short Form 9) was used for the HL measure, which was revised by Chinese scholars Sun et al. [58,59]. Responses were assessed using a four-point scale: “very difficult,” “difficult,” “easy,” and “very easy.” The HLS-SF9 used in this study had no ceiling effect or floor effect. The empirical factor analysis yielded the following fit indices: the chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio χ²/df was 10.844, the Goodness of Fit Index was 0.985, the Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index was 0.971, the Normed Fit Index was 0.986, the Comparative Fit Index was 0.987, and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation was 0.051. Furthermore, the Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.913, and the split-half reliability was 0.871, suggesting that the instrument possesses strong psychometric properties.

This study mainly used SPSS 27.0 and Excel software to process the data. The data used in this study were collected at a single time point, constituting a cross-sectional design, with the predictor variables, mediator variables, and outcome variables all being assessed simultaneously in November 2024, thereby ensuring temporal consistency. The data processing involved the following steps: (1) Use Excel software to pre-process the data obtained from Questionnaire Star and re-measure or delete missing or problematic data. (2) Common method bias was assessed using Harman’s single-factor method. The analysis revealed five principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1, with the largest factor explaining 29.665% of the variance. This value is below the commonly accepted threshold of 40%, indicating that common method bias was not a significant concern in this study. (3) Differences in PA among students of different genders, ethnicities, and grades were analyzed using the chi-square test. Cramer’s V coefficient was used to assess the strength of association between variables, and its value ranges from 0 to 1; with larger values indicating stronger correlations. Cramer’s V coefficient > 0.1 indicates that the correlation between categorical variables is weak; Cramer’s V coefficient > 0.3 indicates a moderate correlation between categorical variables; Cramer’s V coefficient > 0.5 indicates a high correlation between categorical variables [60]. Differences in EMA, PR, and HL among students of different genders, ethnicities, and grades were analyzed using ANOVA, in which η² took values between 0 and 1. According to the criteria proposed by Cohen, a small effect was found at 0.01, a medium effect at 0.06, and a large effect at 0.14 [61]. (4) Pearson’s correlation analyses were conducted to examine the differences in college students’ PA, EMA, PR, and HL correlation analyses. (5) Mediation analyses were conducted using regression analysis. Specific analysis of the mediation effect was performed based on the Process plugin, selecting Model 6. The confidence interval was set to 95%. The Bootstrap method was used for mediation effect analysis to explore the mechanism of action between variables.

As shown in Table2, there is no significant difference in the total PA scores of college students at the ethnic level, X²=4.688 at the ethnic level, V = 0.019. There is a significant difference between gender and grade level. At the gender level X²=1909.363, V = 0.375. at grade level X2= 231.207, V = 0.092.

As can be seen in Table3, PR η² = 0.021 is significantly greater than EMA and HL at the gender level. At the ethnic level, EMA, PR, and HL η² values are 0.003, indicating that ethnic differences have a small effect on all three. PR η²<0.001 was significantly smaller than EMA and HL at the grade level, suggesting that grade level has a greater impact on PR. At the level of EMA, grade level η² = 0.003 was significantly greater than gender and ethnicity, which had a greater effect on EMA. From the PR level, gender η²=0.021 was significantly greater than ethnicity and grade, indicating a greater association between PR and gender. At the level of HL, ethnicity η² < 0.001 was significantly smaller than gender and grade level, indicating that HL is less associated with ethnic differences.

Table4shows a significant positive correlation between PA and HL and its sub-dimensions, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.137 to 0.211. PA and EMA have a significant positive correlation with a correlation coefficientr= 0.177 (P< 001). A significant positive correlation exists between PA and PR with a correlation coefficientr= 0.196 (P< 001). There was also a significant positive correlation between EMA and HL and its sub-dimensions, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.366 to 0.431. EMA and PR had a significant positive correlation with a correlation coefficient ofr= 0.409 (P<001). There was a significant positive correlation between PR and HL and its sub-dimensions, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.277 to 0.334.

The results, as shown in Table5, showed that PA positively predicted EMA (β = 0.022,P< 0.001) PR (β = 0.038,P< 0.001) and HL (β = 0.028,P< 0.001) after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and grade level. PR positively predicted HL (β = 0.281,P< 0.001) and EMA (β = 0.288,P< 0.001). HL positively predicted EMA (β = 0.344,P< 0.001). In comparison to prior research, all hypothesized paths in our study demonstrated statistically significant β coefficients; the magnitude of the β coefficients was modestly lower in comparison to findings from prior research.

As shown in Table6, the 95%CIof PR between PA and EMA: [0.010, 0.012], with a confidence interval excluding 0, indicates that there is a significant mediating role of PR between PA and EMA. PA further enhances an individual’s EMA by increasing PR. The 95%CI: [0.008, 0.011] with a confidence interval excluding 0 for HL between PA and EMA indicates that HL mediates between PA and EMA. Meanwhile, the 95% CI for the chain-mediated effect of PR and HL between PA and EMA was [0.003,0.004], indicating a chain-mediated significant impact. PA further enhances HL by increasing PR, ultimately enhancing an individual’s EMA.

The path coefficient of PA to PR is 0.038,P< 0.001, and PA significantly positively affects PR. The path coefficient of PA to HL is 0.028,P< 0.001, and PA significantly positively affects HL. The path coefficient of PA to EMA is 0.022,P< 0.001, PA has a significant positive effect on EMA. The path coefficient of PR to HL is 0.281,P<0.001; PR significantly impacts HL. The path coefficient of PR to EMA is 0.288,P< 0.001, and PR significantly positively affects EMA. The path coefficient of HL to EMA is 0.344,P< 0.001, and HL has a significant positive effect on EMA. In this case, the higher score of EMA represents the stronger EMA, and the lower score represents the weaker EMA; the higher PA represents the stronger EMA, and on the contrary, the lower PA represents the weaker EMA. Therefore, the mediating effect of this study is shown in Fig.2.

Based on the broaden-and-build theory and social cognitive theory framework, this study aims to elucidate the multidimensional mechanism of action between college students’ PA and EMA and to construct and validate a chain mediation model of college students’ PA and EMA by introducing PR and HL as mediating variables. This study provides a basis for higher education institutions to formulate scientific educational policies and interventions to promote the overall development of college students. The study found that the total effect value of PA on EMA was 0.046, the direct effect value was 0.022, and the indirect effect value was 0.024, indicating that PA has both a direct effect on EMA and an indirect effect through the mediation of PR and HL. The findings deepen the theoretical understanding of the relationship between PA and psychological health and provide multi-dimensional practical insights into psychological health interventions in colleges and universities.

The results of the descriptive analyses of the variables showed that college students’ EMA did not show significant differences in gender and grade dimensions, which is inconsistent with previous studies. Numerous studies have shown that there are significant differences in the gender of students’ EMA at both junior and senior high school levels [62]. Considering the difference between the two, increasing age and psychological maturity may lead to decreasing differences in EMA between genders [63]. It is also possible that this relates to the weakening of traditional gender role distinctions within the socialisation process. The effect of gender on EMA may also be overshadowed by individual differences within the context of modern education. Research findings from both Europe and Latin America indicate significant gender differences in emotion regulation abilities among university students, with female students demonstrating markedly higher competence than their male counterparts. This discrepancy with our study’s results may be attributed to women’s greater propensity to employ cognitive reappraisal strategies for emotion regulation, coupled with their superior emotional awareness [64–66]. The observed divergence from international findings could potentially stem from the Chinese cultural paradigm that advocates emotional restraint for both genders, thereby suppressing the public expression of emotions. Studies from Europe, America, and Africa have shown significant grade-level differences in university students’ emotion regulation abilities, with upperclassmen demonstrating notably higher competence than underclassmen—a finding inconsistent with our research [67]. In Western education systems, the emphasis on autonomous learning and critical thinking enables upperclassmen to accumulate greater experience in coping with stress. Meanwhile, in Africa, fragmented educational structures may contribute to such disparities. By contrast, the collectivist culture in China fosters stronger peer socialization effects, which may explain the divergent findings. Whereas the existence of significant differences in the ethnicity dimension is consistent with the results of previous studies [68].

There are substantial differences in PR among college students in gender, ethnicity, and grade level dimensions, consistent with previous studies’ results [69]. The lower PR level among ethnic minority college students may be related to cultural background and limited resource access. And to a large extent, it may be influenced by cultural identity and social support networks. Considering the rapid development of today’s society and the developed network, the PR of ethnic minority students is expected to gradually increase through cultural adaptive training, enhancement of social support network, and educational interventions, thus narrowing the gap with Han Chinese students.

Significant differences exist in college students’ HL at the gender, ethnicity, and grade level. This is consistent with the findings of many previous studies [70]. Possible reasons for the divergent findings on barriers to accessing health information for ethnic minorities include the low percentage of ethnic minority students in the sample or the lack of cultural adaptability of the measurement instrument. PA among college students was a significant positive predictor of EMA (β = 0.022,p< 0.001), validating hypothesis H1. Consistent with the results of previous studies [71]. And there was a significant positive correlation between PA, its sub-dimensions, and EMA.

This study found a positive mediating effect of PR among college students between PA and EMA with an effect value of 0.011, which is a significant mediating effect, and hypothesis H2 is valid. PR and its sub-dimensions were significantly and positively correlated with PA, its sub-dimensions, and EMA. This reveals that PR plays an important role in bridging the gap between PA and EMA among college students. As a key psychological variable, PR has been frequently applied in various studies, and it plays an important role in an individual’s adaptive capacity when coping with stress and adversity [72]. In this study, PR was used as a mediating variable to explore the mechanism of PA on EMA, and the results showed that the positive mediating effect of PR enhanced the positive impact of PA on EMA. This is consistent with the results of previous studies [71]. That is, there is a significant positive correlation between PR and EMA, which plays an important role in the development and adaptation of individuals [29]. PR not only enhances HL by promoting individuals’ positive attitudes towards health and more effective seeking and use of health information, but also contributes to EMA [73]. Students with high PR typically show higher subjective well-being, including higher life satisfaction and a more positive emotional state, which allows them to show greater resilience and emotional control in the face of stress [74]. These abilities enable them to better adapt to stressful environments and maintain a positive mindset and good psychological health amid challenges. This is of great significance for cultivating high-quality talents in the new era.

The present study revealed a positive mediating effect of HL among university students between PA and EMA with an effect value of 0.010, and hypothesis H3 was established. There was a significant positive correlation between HL and its sub-dimensions with PA and its sub-dimensions and EMA. The study results indicate that in the context of PA, the improvement of HL of university students has a positive contribution to EMA. This is consistent with the results of previous studies [75]. HL and EMA are significantly positively correlated, and improving HL can help individuals better cope with stress and reduce emotional distress. Students with high levels of PA typically exhibit higher physical literacy, including stronger motor ability, higher self-confidence, and more positive attitudes toward participation [76]. They are more inclined to cope with psychological stress through active lifestyles and show greater adaptability and environmental interaction. This helps improve their quality of life and further reinforces the virtuous circle between HL and EMA. As a result, when students are confident that they can achieve the desired health outcomes through regular PA, their HL improves accordingly. This increased self-confidence makes them more likely to engage in regular PA on a consistent basis, which in turn affects their EMA and enhances emotional stability. It also significantly improves an individual’s psychological health, especially in terms of showing greater resilience in coping with life stress and psychological distress [77]. This finding further corroborates the overall enhancing effect of HL on individuals’ quality of life [78].

The present study revealed a chain mediation between PR, HL PA, and EMA with an effect value of 0.004, and hypothesis H4 was valid. Correlation analyses showed that PR and its sub-dimensions, HL and its sub-dimensions were significantly and positively correlated with PA and its sub-dimensions, and EMA and its sub-dimensions, which further validated the accuracy of the chain mediation model. This result suggests that PA positively affects PR through positive and thus enhances HL and positively promotes college students’ EMA through enhanced HL. Bronfenbrenner’s ecosystem theory emphasizes that individual development is influenced by the interactions and influences of multilevel environmental systems [79]. In this study, regular PA can effectively enhance individual PR, and this improved PR promotes HL at the microsystem level.

According to Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory, increased PR allows individuals to access and apply health information more effectively, improving HL [80]. Improved HL provides individuals with better self-management ability and lays the foundation for improved EMA. Intrinsic motivation leads individuals to engage in activities for their own sake, resulting in sustained effort and deeper engagement. Extrinsic motivation, however, prompts individuals to engage in activities to achieve external rewards or avoid punishments [81]. According to Vroom’s expectancy theory, this enhanced HL further enhances an individual’s emotion management self-efficacy and is an important external motivation for EMA [82]. Subsequent studies could adapt the research design employed by Ahmadi et al. to examine the effectiveness of interventions that leverage motivational strategies in supporting both physical activity adherence and the development of emotion regulation skills [83]. Good PR also provides individuals with important internal support that underpins the realization of higher-order needs in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, particularly the need for self-actualization [84]. Regular PA not only enhances an individual’s physical health but also brings about positive changes on an emotional level, which contributes to an individual’s quality of life. Regular participation in PA has been shown to enhance emotional stability significantly and significantly increase the ability to cope with stress [85]. This can consistent with Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory. Thus, PA provides an important way to improve university students’ overall health and well-being by optimizing the chain-mediated pathway of PR and enhanced HL, which ultimately promotes the ability to manage emotions more effectively.

One limitation of this study is its reliance on self-report scales for data collection. This method is susceptible to recall bias, potentially affecting the accuracy of the findings. Social desirability bias could also influence responses, wherein participants might overestimate their PA levels or underreport negative emotions to present a more favorable self-image. Future research could enhance reliability and validity by incorporating objective measurement tools like accelerometers. This study stems from its cross-sectional design. The data were collected at a single point in time, which restricts our ability to infer causal relationships between the variables. Another consideration is that the study may not have fully accounted for other variables that could influence college students’ emotion management abilities. These factors include aspects of the family environment (e.g., socioeconomic status, parent-child relationships), levels of social support (e.g., from friends and teachers), and individual personality traits (e.g., introversion or extraversion). The omission of these variables could impact the explanatory power of the study’s results.

PA of university students significantly enhances EMA through direct pathways and chain-mediated pathways of PR and HL. This study provides a basis for higher education institutions to develop scientific educational policies and interventions aimed at the holistic development of university students. Higher education institutions can design and implement interventions that target PA, PR, and HL to enhance college students’ EMA.
