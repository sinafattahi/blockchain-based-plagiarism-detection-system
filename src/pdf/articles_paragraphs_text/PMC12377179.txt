Cervical disc herniation during pregnancy is a rare but clinically significant condition. While conservative management is generally preferred, progressive neurological symptoms may necessitate surgical intervention. When conservative management fails, a multidisciplinary approach is needed when considering surgical intervention to minimize risk to the mother and fetus.

The authors present the case of a woman in her mid-30s at 24 weeks of gestation, conceived via in vitro fertilization, who developed progressively worsening left C7 radiculopathy refractory to conservative therapies. After comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation, she underwent successful anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with placement of a stand-alone interbody cage. Perioperative planning incorporated anesthetic modifications, fetal monitoring strategies, and minimization of radiation exposure. The patient experienced immediate postoperative relief, rapid functional recovery, and an uncomplicated pregnancy course.

This case illustrates that elective spine surgery during pregnancy can be performed safely when medically indicated, particularly during the 2nd trimester. Meticulous multidisciplinary planning, surgical adaptations to minimize fetal risk, and individualized patient counseling are critical for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. This case emphasizes the importance of patient-centered care in managing spinal pathology during pregnancy.

Symptomatic cervical radiculopathy during pregnancy is rare but can significantly impair a patient’s functional capacity and quality of life. While conservative therapy is preferred, persistent or progressive neurological deficits may necessitate surgical decompression. The decision-making process must account for gestational age, fetal risks, anesthetic considerations, and maternal hemodynamic stability.

We present the unique case of a 24-week pregnant woman who developed refractory C7 radiculopathy during an in vitro fertilization (IVF)–conceived pregnancy and underwent elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) successfully. This report emphasizes critical multidisciplinary perioperative strategies and highlights the feasibility of elective cervical spine surgery during pregnancy in nontraumatic settings in selected patients.

We present the case of a pregnant (via IVF) woman in her mid-30s with no significant medical history who was referred to the neurosurgery clinic in December 2024 for evaluation of progressive neck and left upper extremity pain. Her symptoms began 1 month prior with left arm pain radiating to the posterior arm and scapular region, accompanied by numbness down to the second through fifth fingers. The pain was initially rated 3/10 in November 2024 but progressively escalated to 9/10 by January 2025, significantly impairing sleep and daily functioning. She denied right-sided symptoms, bowel or bladder dysfunction, imbalance, weakness, or falls. Objectively, her neurological examination was unremarkable, with normal strength, sensation, and reflexes in all extremities.

MRI of the cervical spine revealed severe central and foraminal stenosis at C6–7 (Fig. 1). Initial conservative management included physical therapy, which was discontinued after 1 month due to worsening symptoms. Epidural steroid injections were considered but withheld due to her pregnancy. Multiple pain management specialists declined to proceed, citing the unpredictable fetal radiation exposure required for fluoroscopic guidance and increased concern given the patient’s IVF-conceived pregnancy. She also pursued alternative therapies, including acupuncture and chiropractic care, although multiple providers declined to treat her due to her pregnancy. The patient attempted physical therapy and massage therapy from November 2024 to her visit in January 2025, but she had no improvement in her symptoms.

Given the persistence of debilitating symptoms and lack of improvement with conservative measures, a multidisciplinary team comprising neurosurgery, obstetrics, and anesthesiology recommended surgical intervention. The patient was thoroughly counseled on the risks of surgery during pregnancy, including potential maternal and fetal complications, and elected to proceed with an ACDF at 24 weeks’ gestation.

The patient was evaluated preoperatively by her OB/GYN, who cleared her for surgery and recommended fetal heart tone monitoring before and after the procedure. Results of a preoperative fetal anatomical survey and echocardiogram were normal. She had been on a daily regimen of aspirin to decrease the risk of preeclampsia associated with advanced maternal age pregnancy. Her aspirin was discontinued 1 week preoperatively.

Key obstetric and anesthetic risks discussed included the potential for stillbirth, reduced fetal movement due to succinylcholine-induced fetal paralysis, and fetal radiation exposure during intraoperative fluoroscopy, which could theoretically increase the risk of hematological malignancy for the fetus later in life. The patient was advised to monitor fetal movements postoperatively. In alignment with updated safety guidelines, abdominal shielding was not used during fluoroscopy (Table 1).

To prevent aortocaval compression, the patient was positioned with a left lateral tilt. While this is well tolerated for anterior cervical surgery in the 2nd trimester, prone positioning for lumbar procedures is generally reserved for early pregnancy, with lateral or modified approaches preferred later due to increased uterine size and monitoring limitations. Pain management included acetaminophen and opioids (as needed), and avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) postoperatively. Sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin were recommended until the patient was ambulatory.

From an anesthetic standpoint, the patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists class II with a metabolic equivalent of task score of 2. Given her gestational age and increased aspiration risk, she received preoperative intravenous famotidine and ondansetron and oral sodium citrate (Bicitra). Endotracheal intubation was carefully planned, given the potential for airway edema during pregnancy. Rapid-sequence induction was employed. A thorough airway, dental, and respiratory examination was completed preoperatively to anticipate potential difficulties with intubation.

A transverse incision was planned medial to the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, using anatomical landmarks—specifically Chassaignac’s tubercle—to avoid the use of fluoroscopy. Dissection proceeded through the platysma, with careful exposure of the anterior cervical spine through the avascular plane between the carotid sheath and strap muscles. The C6–7 disc space was identified and confirmed via fluoroscopy (Fig. 2A). After annulotomy, a microsurgical discectomy was performed using a combination of pituitary rongeurs, high-speed burr, and Kerrison punches to decompress the spinal canal and neural foramina. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed bilaterally, and the dura and exiting nerve roots were fully decompressed.

An 8-mm titanium interbody cage with 7° of lordosis, packed with demineralized bone matrix, was placed at C6–7 and secured using two 12-mm fixation nails. Due to the patient’s pregnancy and the goal of limiting radiation exposure, a stand-alone cage construct was selected instead of anterior cervical plating. One radiograph was obtained to localize the disc level, and two radiographs were obtained to verify the nails in the lateral and anteroposterior directions (Fig. 2). Neuromonitoring remained stable throughout the case.

Following thorough irrigation with antibiotic solution, the wound was closed in layers. The platysma and subcutaneous tissues were approximated with Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with a running Monocryl suture. Instrument and sponge counts were correct at case completion, and no postoperative imaging was obtained. The patient was transferred to the postoperative recovery unit in stable condition.

The patient experienced immediate postoperative relief of her neck, shoulder, and arm pain. Numbness and tingling in the affected fingers significantly improved, with only minimal residual paresthesia in the index digit. Pain control was effectively managed with minimal use of opioids. She remained hemodynamically stable, and fetal monitoring by the OB/GYN team preoperatively and postoperatively revealed normal fetal heart tones and movement.

She was evaluated by physical and occupational therapy and discharged on postoperative day 1 in stable condition. A postoperative radiograph was not obtained in keeping with the plan to limit fetal radiation exposure. At the time of discharge, the patient was ambulating independently and tolerating oral intake.

At her 1-week follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of left arm radicular pain and numbness, improved sleep, and full return to activities of daily living. She resumed aspirin therapy 1 week postoperatively without complication and was no longer requiring any analgesics for pain control. Her pregnancy continued to progress without issues, and she remained under regular surveillance by her obstetrics team. At the 6-week follow-up visit with the neurosurgery team, the patient continued to remain pain free, and her pregnancy continued to progress without issues or complications.

The necessary informed consent was obtained in this study.

The surgical management of symptomatic cervical disc herniation during pregnancy presents a complex clinical challenge requiring careful balancing of maternal and fetal risks. In this case, a multidisciplinary approach enabled the safe and successful performance of an ACDF during the 2nd trimester in a patient who had conceived via IVF. The patient presented with progressive C7 radiculopathy that was refractory to conservative therapies, ultimately necessitating surgical intervention after exhaustive nonoperative measures failed.

The timing of surgical intervention was critical to the successful outcome. The 2nd trimester, typically between 14 and 28 weeks of gestation, is considered the safest period for nonobstetric surgeries, given the lower risks of teratogenicity and spontaneous abortion associated with 1st trimester procedures, as well as a reduced risk of preterm labor compared to 3rd trimester interventions.9Careful consideration should be taken when the fetus reaches viability after 22 weeks. Additionally, maternal physiological changes, including increased blood volume and uterine size, can be more easily accommodated during this period, permitting safer anesthesia and surgical positioning.

Anesthetic management was carefully adapted to the physiological demands of pregnancy. Rapid-sequence induction was utilized to mitigate the increased aspiration risk caused by delayed gastric emptying. Preoperative aspiration prophylaxis with intravenous famotidine and oral sodium citrate further reduced the risk. Airway management was approached with caution, given the presence of pregnancy-associated airway edema. Intraoperatively, strict attention was paid to maintaining maternal oxygenation and avoiding hyperventilation, to ensure optimal fetal oxygen delivery and preserve uteroplacental perfusion.10Likewise, our patient was placed in a left lateral tilt utilizing a bump to minimize aortocaval compression.

Minimizing fetal radiation exposure was another major priority. Intraoperative fluoroscopy was used sparingly, and abdominal shielding was consciously avoided in accordance with updated guidelines, which discourage routine shielding due to potential interference with automatic exposure control and increased scatter.11A stand-alone interbody cage was selected instead of anterior cervical plating to reduce operative time and limit fluoroscopic imaging, reflecting contemporary trends in cervical spine surgery favoring minimally invasive techniques.12,13In this case, fluoroscopy was limited to just two shots, one for localization and one for pin placement, compared with the 10–15 shots typically required in nonpregnant patients. This reduction was achieved through reliance on anatomical landmarks and careful surgical planning. Notably, fluoroscopic exposure during cervical epidural steroid injections may be equal to or greater than that used in this case, highlighting the relative safety and control offered by the surgical approach. Furthermore, postoperative radiographs were not obtained so as to decrease radiation exposure to the fetus.

Postoperative pain management strategies prioritized both maternal and fetal safety. Acetaminophen and patient-controlled analgesia were utilized, while NSAIDs were avoided due to their known association with adverse fetal outcomes, including premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.14Early mobilization was encouraged postoperatively to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events, which are inherently increased in the pregnant population. Additionally, intraoperative neuromonitoring with SSEPs and MEPs was employed safely, with no evidence of harm to the fetus.

An important element influencing the decision to proceed surgically was the impact of uncontrolled pain on the patient’s overall well-being. Given the restrictions imposed by pregnancy, many nonoperative interventions, such as corticosteroid injections or acupuncture, were either contraindicated or inaccessible secondary to a majority of providers declining to perform such interventions in pregnancy. Consequently, the patient experienced worsening pain, sleep deprivation, and escalating stress levels. These factors are not benign; chronic maternal stress, depression, insomnia, and hypertension are independently associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and impaired neurodevelopment. Another important factor influencing the decision to proceed with surgery was the patient’s subjective sense of left arm weakness, despite normal strength on examination. She was deeply concerned that her symptoms might worsen and interfere with her ability to safely hold or nurse her baby. Specifically, she described difficulty maintaining arm and wrist positioning during daily tasks and feared that prolonged infant holding could lead to muscle fatigue and accidental dropping. This concern is plausible, as C7 radiculopathy affects the triceps, wrist extensors, and finger extensors, which are important for arm stability and functional use during infant care. These concerns supported the multidisciplinary decision to proceed with surgical intervention.15,16Taken together, conservative measures ultimately proved unsuccessful and justified the decision to proceed with surgical intervention.

Beyond the technical considerations, this case highlights the critical role of comprehensive perioperative planning, including obstetric clearance, intraoperative left lateral tilt positioning to prevent aortocaval compression, continuous fetal surveillance, and coordination of postoperative care. Preoperative interdisciplinary counseling was essential to establishing a patient-centered approach that respected maternal autonomy while protecting fetal health.

First, while the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends delaying elective surgeries until after delivery when possible, clinical judgment must prevail when maternal symptoms become severe and refractory. Studies have indicated that 50%–80% of pregnant women report significant back or radicular pain, with approximately 10% stating that it prevented them from working and 80% reporting that it affected their daily routine, including housework, childrearing, and job performance.17Persistent, uncontrolled pain during pregnancy increases the risk of chronic pain syndromes and is associated with elevated maternal stress, depression, insomnia, and hypertension, all of which can adversely affect fetal outcomes. In cases in which conservative management fails, surgical intervention may be not only justified but necessary to safeguard both maternal and fetal health.

Second, proper surgical timing is essential. Performing surgery during the 2nd trimester minimized the procedural and anesthetic risks associated with other gestational periods. Multidisciplinary coordination and shared decision-making were critical to aligning treatment goals, navigating ethical considerations, and ensuring informed consent, particularly when addressing rare but catastrophic risks such as preterm labor, fetal demise, and maternal morbidity.

Third, technical modifications tailored to pregnancy including limiting fluoroscopy, utilizing a stand-alone cage without plating, and ensuring left uterine displacement helped optimize maternal and fetal outcomes without compromising surgical goals. The use of perioperative neuromonitoring and a carefully selected anesthesia protocol further contributed to the safety of the procedure.

Although no immediate maternal or fetal complications were encountered, the need for long-term follow-up remains. While current evidence suggests that a single exposure to general anesthesia during pregnancy is not associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, further prospective studies are needed to fully elucidate potential long-term effects on fetal brain development.

In conclusion, this case adds to the growing body of evidence that elective spine surgery can be performed safely during pregnancy when clinically indicated, particularly during the 2nd trimester. Moreover, this is the first report to describe elective cervical spine surgery in pregnancy. Careful perioperative planning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and patient-centered decision-making remain essential to optimizing outcomes. Future efforts should focus on developing standardized guidelines for surgical management of spinal pathology during pregnancy and on further investigating the long-term outcomes for children exposed to nonobstetric surgeries in utero.
