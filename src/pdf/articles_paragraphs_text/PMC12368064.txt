This paper focuses on a combined SIR-SI epidemic model to evaluate the transmission dynamics of dengue fever, integrating the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework for the human population with the susceptible-infected (SI) framework for mosquitoes. The model is formulated as a system of nonlinear differential equations and is further extended by incorporating fractional-order derivatives in the Caputo sense to capture memory effects in disease transmission. A thorough investigation of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points is conducted, encompassing both local and global stability at the disease-free state. The basic reproduction number,, is derived, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key parameters influencing the transmission dynamics. To ensure mathematical rigor, the existence and uniqueness of the model’s solutions are also examined. For numerical approximation, the two-step Lagrange polynomial method is applied, enabling simulation of the model under various fractional orders and parameter settings. The results demonstrate that the fractional-order approach offers deeper insights into the dynamics of dengue transmission, highlighting the importance of memory effects. These findings provide valuable guidance for medical professionals, policymakers, and public health authorities in designing more effective control strategies.

Dengue fever is caused by a mosquito infected with the dengue virus, which is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites.

Between 100 and 400 million cases are reported annually, meaning nearly half of the world’s population is at risk.

Urban and semi-urban areas in tropical and subtropical climates are the most common locations where the disease is found.

There is no specific treatment available for dengue or severe dengue.

Mathematical modeling is crucial for managing epidemics and implementing preventive measures. This study analyzes infection and recovery rate statistics, utilizing several mathematical models established in recent decades to enhance understanding and predictions. Examples include the simultaneous outbreak of dengue and COVID-19 in Brazil4, the interaction between Zika and Dengue with cross-enhancement effects5, and a fractional-order model incorporating quarantine and vaccination strategies for dengue transmission6. A well-known framework for studying disease spread is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, first proposed in7. Additional models have been examined, including the SIR model with constant human and vector populations, as well as the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model, specifically developed for studying the impact of rainfall on the spread of dengue in Thailand8. Supriatna et al.9analyzed the SIR-SI model, incorporating age-dependent survival rates, effectively describing dengue transmission dynamics between humans and mosquitoes. The authors discussed comparing the Wolbachia strategy and vaccination, highlighting the potential of combining or prioritizing biological interventions for controlling dengue.

Fractional calculus is currently a popular and emerging area of study10–13. The research conducted in this newly established study topic has been published in prestigious journals, seminars, workshops, and international conferences, showcasing its high quality and demonstrating its potential and practicality. The study is motivated by the extensive application of fractional calculus in several engineering and science fields. Prominent mathematicians such as Fourier, Liouville, Euler, and Riemann made significant contributions to classical calculus during the 18th century, which were documented in the literature. Moreover, that specific era was widely recognized as the pinnacle of fractional calculus, during which numerous significant breakthroughs were achieved. Fractional calculus remains a subject of great interest among scholars, primarily due to its extensive range of practical applications. Fractional calculus has been employed in mathematical modelling to elucidate diverse inherent phenomena and retrieve measurements that classical calculus cannot represent. Furthermore, because of the localized nature of its fractional differential operator, fractional calculus exhibits a greater level of freedom compared to classical calculus. Recent research has developed fractional models, such as a generalized HBV model that captures both transmission channels, an HBV model with cell-to-cell and virus-to-cell transmissions and adaptive immunity, and a two-strain SVLIR model with vaccination and quarantine14–16.

We examine the SIR-SI epidemic model41,42, which is a model that integrates two distinct frameworks in this section. The modeling framework includes of an SIR structure for the human population and an SI structure for the mosquito population. In this framework, the human population is divided into three compartments: susceptible (), infected (), and recovered () individuals. Likewise, the mosquito population is divided into two compartments: susceptible () and infected (). It is further assumed that the total populations of both humans and mosquitoes remain constant over time, as reflected in the following equations.

At the timet,denotes the numbers of susceptible,denote the numbers of infected anddenote the numbers of recovered humans, respectively, whereasindicate the numbers of susceptible andindicate the numbers of infected mosquitoes. The integrated model is expressed as a set of nonlinear differential equations representing the transmission dynamics between people and mosquitoes.

The closed regionis positively invarient set for model (12).

The model admits two categories of equilibrium points: the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium. According to model (12), we perform calculations on both points for the model.

The DFE occurs when there is no infection in the population, i.e.,and. The DFE point () of the model system (12) can be calculated by putting,,   andand is given as.

The, represents the expected number of secondary infections generated by a single infective individual in a fully susceptible population. It serves as a critical measure of disease spread potential and acts as a threshold for the stability of the DFE, aiding in disease control strategies.

In numerous epidemiological models, a DFE exists, representing a state where the population is disease-free. The theorems below address the local and global stability of the DFE, denoted as.

The DFE of the model system described in Eq. (12) is locally asymptotically stable if, and becomes unstable when.

By the Routh–Hurwitz-criteria45of stability and some algebraic manipulations, it can easily be proved that if. Consequently, the Jacobian matrix () has negative real components in all of its eigenvalues. Hence, the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the model system (12) is locally asymptotically stable if, and becomes unstable when.

The following theorem investigates the DFE’s global stability using the approach developed by Castillo-Chavez and Song46.

A numerical technique utilizing the Caputo operator has been presented for modeling both nonlinear and linear systems, as previously identified by researchers50. Consequently, we now examine an IVP involving FO differential operators. We additionally construct a numerical approach utilizing Caputo derivatives to generate numerical estimates for models with both nonlinear and linear components50. The IVP involving the Caputo operator can be expressed as follows.

This study employed the Caputo fractional derivative to investigate the epidemic dynamics of a SIR-SI model. Numerical techniques were implemented to solve the proposed system. Both the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points were explored, and a comprehensive analysis of local and global stability at the disease-free equilibrium was conducted. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of parameters,,, andwas conducted concerning the basic reproduction number. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution within a stable framework were established. Numerical simulations supported the theoretical findings, showing that the fractional-order model exhibited a lower peak of infection, aligning more accurately with empirical data. The impact of varying parameter values on the model’s outcomes was discussed. Fractional mathematical modeling demonstrated a more precise and resilient approach for epidemiological models by utilizing fractional orders that closely matched real-world data. The fractional SIR-SI model can be expanded in future studies by adding other dengue serotypes, climate variables, and actual data. Stochastic or spatial dynamics and time-dependent fractional orders could enhance realism. These developments can improve forecasting precision and facilitate better public health strategies for preventing dengue fever outbreaks.
