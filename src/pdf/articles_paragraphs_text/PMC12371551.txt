A 23‐year‐old Afghan man presented with a traumatic carotid‐jugular fistula (CJF) and a right common carotid pseudoaneurysm following a gunshot wound. Persistent neck pain and pulsation led to imaging, which revealed an aneurysmal dilation and fistulous connection. He underwent successful open surgical repair, which included resection of the aneurysm and reconstruction of the affected vessels. Postoperative recovery was marked by the resolution of symptoms and normal function. This case underscores the effectiveness of open surgery for complex CJFs.

Open surgical repair is a viable and effective approach for managing traumatic CJFs, providing complete resolution in complex cases where endovascular methods may not be feasible, particularly in resource‐limited settings.

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) may result from an arterial injury and appear grossly as pathologic connections between an artery and a vein, causing reduced blood flow to the distal tissues relative to the flow through the AVF [1]. Traumatic carotid‐jugular fistulas (CJF) have only been reported in 4% to 7% of all cases of traumatic AVFs [1,2,3]. If Runtreated, these rare injuries can result in congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebral ischemia, embolization, and bleeding [4,5].

The current management options for CJFs include open surgery, which, despite its higher complexity, provides direct access and the possibility of complete repair, making it a suitable choice in certain complex cases, and endovascular surgery as a less invasive method indicated in some cases [1,5,6]. We reported the successful open surgery repair of a right common carotid pseudoaneurysm in a 23‐year‐old Afghan man who presented with CJF after a gunshot wound. As far as we know, this case was the first case report of traumatic CJF surgery conducted in Iran and also the first CJF case in the Afghan people. This case not only adds to the limited existing literature on traumatic CJFs but also demonstrates the viability of open surgical intervention in resource‐limited settings, underscoring its significance in clinical practice.

A 23‐year‐old Afghan man was admitted to the general surgery department with a 6‐month history of throbbing pain and pulsation in the right side of his neck. Nine months prior to admission, he experienced a penetrating trauma from a gunshot wound to the right lateral side of his neck, for which he underwent bullet removal surgery immediately.

On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, including a pulse rate of 83, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, blood pressure of 128/79 mmHg, a temperature of 36.8, and oxygen saturation of 99%. On physical examination, the patient was awake and alert to time, place, and person.

Auscultation over the neck identified a significant venous systolic thrill on the right lateral side. Cardiovascular examinations revealed normal S1 and S2 with full and symmetric peripheral pulses. Neurological examinations, including sensation, strength, and reflexes, were absolutely normal.

Laboratory tests, including levels of complete blood count, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine, were within normal limits.

Contrast‐enhanced spiral Computed‐Tomography of the neck demonstrated aneurysmal dilation of the distal common carotid artery (15*14 mm) with an arteriovenous fistula involving the right internal jugular vein (Figure1).

The patient was prepared for open vascular surgery. After induction of general anesthesia, skin and subcutaneous tissue were incised anteriorly to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) in a semi‐extension and left‐rotation position. Then, the skin and subcutaneous tissue over the fistula site were opened. Strap muscles were opened, and exploration of the right common carotid artery and internal jugular vein was performed. The presentation of the fistula was shown in Figure2. The common carotid artery was controlled proximally. The artery was aneurysmal at the fistula site. The jugular vein was controlled from the proximal and distal sites of the AVF. Five thousand units of heparin were injected. After 3 min, the artery and internal jugular vein were clamped proximally and distally at the fistula site. Then, the internal jugular vein was gently separated from the carotid artery. The distal and proximal segments of the common carotid artery were clamped for 5 min; subsequently, the aortic clamp was removed elliptically at the aneurysmal site for reduction of the risk of embolization, and arterial repair was performed using 6–0 Prolene sutures. Subsequently, a leak test was performed; blood flow was pulsatile and adequate distal to the site of aneurysm repair. The fistula was removed elliptically at the aneurysmal site. The aneurysm was repaired. A leak test was performed, and distal pulsatile flow was adequate. Then, the internal jugular vein was mobilized from the surrounding tissues and repaired at the fistula site using Prolene 6–0 sutures. The SCM was released, and it was placed between the repaired artery and vein. Hemostasis was achieved. A Hemovac drain was inserted. The surgery site wound was closed with subcuticular Monocryl sutures (Figure3represents the surgical site after the repairment).

After the surgery, the patient went on to complete vascular and neurological examinations. The patient's sensation, movement, and muscle strength were normal, and the distal pulses were full and similar to each other. The vital signs were normal and stable. After two days, he was discharged with improved signs and symptoms.

CJFs represent complex vascular injuries that require skilled diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These rare and potentially life‐threatening conditions demand comprehensive medical evaluation and precise intervention to prevent severe complications such as cerebral ischemia, systemic embolization, hemodynamic disruptions, and heart failure [7].

In our case, the CJF originated from a penetrating gunshot wound, highlighting the intricate nature of traumatic vascular injuries. The diagnostic process relied on critical clinical findings, including a venous systolic thrill and radiographic evidence of a pseudoaneurysm, which are essential for accurate assessment and subsequent management [8].

The selection of treatment methods requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Open surgical repair emerged as the preferred approach, offering significant advantages over alternative interventions. However, certain absolute and relative contraindications must be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding with surgical intervention.

Absolute contraindications for open surgical repair include severe systemic coagulopathy, uncontrolled cardiovascular instability, and advanced multiorgan failure. Relative contraindications encompass age with multiple comorbidities, a compromised immune system, recent myocardial infarction, inadequate nutritional status, and tracheostomy [9].

Endovascular treatments present their own set of limitations, including challenges with complex anatomical vascular configurations, small vessel diameter, high embolic risk, and potential long‐term medication compliance issues. The chosen surgical approach provided several critical benefits: direct visualization of vascular pathology, immediate structural reconstruction, comprehensive control of underlying tissue damage, and lower long‐term embolic complication risks; endovascular treatments, while less invasive, demonstrate significant drawbacks: prolonged anticoagulation requirements, higher risk of repeated interventions, and increased potential for long‐term complications [10].

Critical factors influencing treatment selection included the patient's young age, specific anatomical injury characteristics, low socioeconomic situation affecting follow‐up, potential for comprehensive rehabilitation, and individual risk profile.

The successful management of traumatic CJFs through open surgical repair, as demonstrated in our case report, aligns with findings from several studies in the literature.

For instance, Alonso‐Argüeso et al. emphasized the effectiveness of endovascular treatment for complex CJFs, but they also acknowledged the limitations of this approach in specific cases where direct surgical intervention is necessary. Their research highlights that while endovascular methods can be less invasive, they may not provide the comprehensive repair needed for complex vascular injuries, particularly in resource‐limited settings [1].

Similarly, Sinha et al. reported a case of a traumatic common carotid‐internal jugular arteriovenous fistula that required surgical intervention due to life‐threatening complications, reinforcing the notion that open surgery remains a viable option when faced with significant anatomical challenges [2].

Furthermore, Góes et al. provided insight into surgical repair techniques for traumatic CJFs, noting that direct access allows for thorough exploration and repair of the affected vessels. This perspective is echoed in our case, where open surgical repair not only addressed the immediate vascular injury but also ensured long‐term stability and function [2].

Overall, these studies collectively underscore the importance of individualized treatment approaches based on patient‐specific factors and the complexity of the injury, supporting the efficacy of open surgical repair as a critical option in managing traumatic CJFs.

This case highlights the successful open surgical repair of a traumatic CJF in a young Afghan patient with limited financial resources. The patient's socioeconomic constraints and the lack of access to endovascular interventions in a resource‐limited setting necessitated a cost‐effective, definitive surgical approach. Open repair not only resolved symptoms but also minimized long‐term costs and follow‐up burdens, which are critical for patients facing economic hardship. The outcome underscores the importance of tailoring treatment strategies to local resource availability and patient‐specific socioeconomic factors.
