Detecting enzyme activity that catalyzes subtle functional group transformations in live cells remains a major challenge. We introduce a conditional metabolic labeling strategy for enzymatic activity detection (cMLEAD), which harnesses cellular metabolic pathways to deliver indirect yet reliable activity readouts. Unlike traditional metabolic labeling approaches relying on nonspecific incorporation of tagged biomolecules, cMLEAD employs a tagged precursor whose metabolic incorporation is strictly dependent on specific enzymatic activity, effectively transforming a metabolic labeling event into an enzyme-activity measurement. Using aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the robustness of the strategy. cMLEAD for ALDH2 employs azido-tagged acetaldehyde, metabolized by ALDH2 into azidoacetate, which feeds into the acetyl-CoA biosynthetic pathway and is incorporated into lysine acylation, enabling fluorescence-based detectionviaclick chemistry. The assay reliably reports ALDH2 activity, as validated through genetic and pharmacological modulation. cMLEAD further revealed suppressed ALDH2 activity under cellular senescence and oxidative stress, with direct inhibition by H2O2likely contributing in part. Notably, cMLEAD is complementary to conventionalin vitroassays and advantageous in preserving the native enzyme context. Leveraging this advantage, we developed a screening platform that identified sennoside A as a candidate ALDH2 activator, which alleviated light-induced retinal degeneration in mice. This study establishes cMLEAD as a robust and versatile platform for probing ALDH2 activity in pathophysiologically relevant contexts and facilitating therapeutic discovery. We envision the conceptual framework of cMLEAD may be adapted to other enzymes whose catalytic products feed into detectable metabolic incorporation.

A conditional metabolic labeling strategy for enzymatic activity detection is reported.

Enzymes are biological catalysts essential for facilitating biochemical reactions and regulating metabolic pathways. Cellular enzyme activity fluctuates dynamically, enabling cells to adapt to environmental changes. Detecting enzyme activity is critical for understanding cellular functions and the mechanisms underlying various diseases.1Traditional biochemical assays typically require cell lysis to release enzymes,2which can disrupt their native conformation and activity. Furthermore, isolating enzymes from their cellular context eliminates critical interactions that modulate function and loses real-time dynamic information.3Consequently, these methods may not accurately reflectin vivoenzyme behavior,4underscoring the need for innovative approaches that enable real-time monitoring within live cells.

Recent advancements have introduced activity-based small-molecule probes for measuring enzyme activity in live cells.5–8These probes typically consist of organic dyes conjugated to natural substrates, with activatable signals generated by enzyme-catalyzed cleavage reactions. For instance, fluorophore–peptide conjugates detect protease activity;9phosphorylated fluorophores monitor phosphatases;10and fluorophore–saccharide conjugates track glycosidases.11These enzymes generally tolerate significant structural changes in their substrates, and their cleavage-based reactions facilitate robust activatable signals. While these designs have yielded practical tools for detecting enzyme activities in intact cells, their efficacy diminishes when applied to enzymes that catalyze subtle chemical transformations, particularly those whose native substrates allow only minimal structural modification. The key challenges lie in maintaining efficient enzymatic turnover and in generating distinguishable fluorescence signals for reliable readouts.

Herein, we address this challenge by introducing a strategy that links ALDH2 activity to detectable metabolic incorporation of azide groups onto proteins that can be subsequently labeled with fluorophores. This approach, conditional metabolic labeling for enzymic activity detection (cMLEAD), leverages ALDH2's catalytic oxidation of azido-tagged acetaldehyde to azidoacetate, which is then funneled through the cellular metabolic machinery to produce azido-acetyl-CoA and subsequently azido-acetylated proteins.25,26As a result, azidoacetaldehyde-derived protein azido-acetylation can serve as downstream proxy for ALDH2 activity (Fig. 1C). By coupling enzyme-specific substrate conversion with the metabolic labeling framework, cMLEAD enables the live-cell monitoring of enzyme activities that tolerate only minimal substrate modifications. We validated this concept using azido-tagged acetaldehyde and fluorescent click chemistry to monitor protein labeling. This assay reliably measured ALDH2 activity, as confirmed by genetic modulation of ALDH2 expression and pharmacological perturbations using specific activators and inhibitors. Furthermore, cMLEAD revealed decreased cellular ALDH2 activity under glucose deprivation and senescence, with direct inhibition by H2O2likely contributing in part. We also developed a screening platform using cMLEAD and identified a candidate ALDH2 activator. These findings highlight the utility of cMLEAD for mechanistic investigation and therapeutic discovery. While this study focuses on ALDH2, the conceptual framework of cMLEAD may be extended to other enzymes, provided that their catalytic products feed into metabolic incorporation.

Alcohol-derived acetaldehyde is metabolized into acetate by ALDH2, which subsequently contributes to protein acetylation.26–29Capitalizing on this metabolic linkage, we hypothesized that ALDH2 activity could be indirectly measured by detecting acetylation derived from tagged acetaldehyde. Given the small size of the azido group, its established utility in biomolecule labeling, and the high efficiency of copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC),30–32we employed azido-tagged acetaldehyde (AAN3) as the surrogate substrate. We envisioned that AAN3would be oxidized by ALDH2 to azidoacetate, subsequently converted to azido-acetyl-CoA, and incorporated into protein acetylation. The resulting azido-labeled proteins could then be visualized through CuAAC using a fluorescent alkyne, with the signal intensity proportional to cellular ALDH2 activity (Fig. 2A).

The feasibility of this approach hinges on fulfilling the following four key criteria. First, AAN3must serve as an ALDH2 substrate. Previous studies support the feasibility of AAN3serving as a substrate for ALDH2 because larger aldehydes have been shown to be processed as substrates of this enzyme.23,24To evaluate this, we measured kinetic parameters of recombinant human ALDH2 to AAN3versusthe native substrate acetaldehyde (AA), by quantifying NAD+to NADH conversion. Both substrates were successfully converted by ALDH2, confirming AAN3's compatibility. However, AAN3(80 μM) exhibited almost 40-fold higherKmthan AA (1.8 μM) (Fig. 2B), underscoring ALDH2's limited tolerance for substrate modifications and supporting the need for a metabolic labeling-based detection method. Fortunately, the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) towards AAN3(1.6 min−1μM−1) was only 10-fold compromised compared to AA (17 min−1μM−1), warranting further study.

Second, AAN3should not significantly alter endogenous protein acetylation levels, thereby ensuring an accurate readout of ALDH2 activity. To assess this, we examined cellular lysine acetylation using a pan-acetyl lysine antibody. At concentrations up to 0.5 mM, AAN3had a negligible impact on global acetylation levels under the assay conditions; however, 1.0 mM AAN3led to a noticeable decrease (Fig. 2Cand S1), suggesting that working concentrations under 0.5 mM may be tolerable.

Third, AAN3should exhibit low cytotoxicity. An MTT assay in Li-7 human liver cancer cells revealed no significant toxicity at concentrations up to 0.5 mM after 8 hours of incubation. In contrast, concentrations above 1.0 mM resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability (Fig. 2D), reinforcing 0.5 mM AAN3as a physiologically compatible dose.

Fourth, the AAN3-derived azidoacetate must be recognized by endogenous acetyl-CoA synthetases and further processed by acetyltransferases to generate azido-labeled acylated proteins. To validate this, Li-7 cells pretreated with AAN3were subjected to a classical CuAAC condition,33labelled with an alkyne-Rhodamine (RHO) synthesized according to literature procedures.34Confocal imaging showed an AAN3dose- (Fig. 2Eand S2) and incubation time-dependent increase in cellular fluorescence (Fig. 2F and G), with AAN3at 0.5 mM and an incubation time of 8 h giving a statistically significant increase of cellular RHO fluorescence. This suggests the proposed metabolic incorporation of the azido group into proteins as shown inFig. 2A. To exclude the possibility of direct covalent crosslinking of AAN3with proteins or nucleic acids, we treated the samples with methoxyamine prior to CuAAC, a procedure generally employed to release aldehyde-induced crosslinking in chemoproteomics.35No significant difference in cellular fluorescence intensity was observed between the samples with and without methoxyamine treatment (Fig. S3). This suggests minimal interference from aldehyde-induced conjugation effects, likely eliminated by the stringent CuAAC washing steps. Notably, background fluorescence was detected in cells without AAN3pretreatment, indicating nonspecific binding of the RHO fluorophore. This nonspecific binding is also found in a commercial alkynyl Rhodamine (Fig. S4). Together, these results confirm that AAN3-derived metabolites are successfully incorporated into protein acetylation, providing a robust foundation for imaging ALDH2 activity using the cMLEAD strategy.

After confirming the feasibility of cMLEAD for measuring ALDH2 activity, we optimized the experimental conditions to enhance detection sensitivity. Initial tests, where cells were incubated with AAN3(0.5 mM) for 8 h followed by classical CuAAC reaction conditions, yielded only a modest 1.5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the vehicle group (Fig. 2G). This limited sensitivity was attributed to two primary factors, the low proportion of protein acetylation by acetyl-CoA, which also functions as an essential energy precursor, and the low efficiency of CuAAC under complex cellular environments. To improve CuAAC efficiency and imaging contrast, we systematically optimized the reaction conditions.

In CuAAC, a chelating ligand is necessary to protect the copper cation from generating excessive reactive oxygen species and to minimize side reactions.36The catalytic Cu(i) species is generated by reducing Cu(ii)in situto catalyze the cycloaddition between an azide and an alkyne.37According to this mechanism, both the reducing agent, Cu(ii) dose, and the chelating ligand should be critical to determine the reaction efficiency. By systematic optimization on these three parameters (Fig. S5–S7), the final CuAAC reaction conditions were set at 0.5 mM CuSO4, 2.5 mM Vc, and 600 μM THPTA, resulting in a 35-fold increase in cellular fluorescence intensity compared to the initial conditions. Further optimization on the click reaction time and RHO concentration revealed 2.5 μM RHO and a 60-min reaction time as optimal (Fig. S8 and S9).

To rigorously validate cMLEAD for faithfully reporting ALDH2 activity, we modulated ALDH2 activity in HepG2 cells through genetic and pharmacological means. Lentiviral vector infection carrying either the ALDH2 gene or its small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated HepG2 cells with ALDH2 overexpression or knockdown. Western blot analysis confirmed the expected upregulation and downregulation of ALDH2 protein levels (Fig. S10). Consistently, cMLEAD staining showed a pronounced increase in fluorescence intensity in ALDH2-overexpressing cells, whereas ALDH2-knockdown cells exhibited a near-complete loss of signal (Fig. 3A and B), indicating that the observed fluorescence in the cMLEAD assay is tightly correlated with ALDH2 activity.

To further validate the reliability of the strategy, we pharmacologically modulated ALDH2 activity using well-characterized small molecules. HepG2 cells were treated with Alda-1, a known ALDH2 activator,17or dyclonine, an ALDH2 inhibitor,38prior to cMLEAD labeling. Alda-1 induced a dose-dependent increase in cMLEAD fluorescence intensity, with an EC50of 11 μM (Fig. 3D, Eand S11), consistent with reported values.17Conversely, dyclonine treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 3D, Fand S12). While the IC50of dyclonine could not be accurately determined due to cytotoxicity at higher concentrations, the trend supports the dependence of cMLEAD signal on ALDH2 activity. Notably, neither Alda-1 nor dyclonine altered the expression levels of ALDH2 (Fig. S13), indicating that the observed fluorescence changes were due to functional modulation of enzymatic activity rather than changes in enzyme abundance. To check if the pharmacological treatments affected protein acetylation, we performed immunofluorescence staining with the pan acetyl lysine monoclonal antibody. No significant global changes were observed across treatment groups under the assay condition (Fig. S14), supporting ALDH2-dependence of the cMLEAD readout. In addition, ALDH2 activity was independently evaluated using a conventional NADH-based assay after cell lysis, and the resulting trends mirrored those seen with cMLEAD labeling (Fig. 3C), reinforcing the assay's reliability. Collectively, these results establish cMLEAD as an ALDH2-dependent live-cell imaging platform for quantifying its activity with desirable sensitivity. The consistency across genetic and pharmacological manipulations underscores its utility not only for biological investigations but also for screening small-molecule modulators of ALDH2 in cellular settings.

To further validate the mechanism underlying the cMLEAD strategy for measuring ALDH2 activity by measuring AAN3-derived protein acetylation, we performed colocalization experiments to investigate the spatial relationship between the RHO fluorescence signal from cMLEAD and proteins typically subject to acetylation. For this purpose, we selected α-tubulin as a representative cytoplasmic protein and histone H3 as a representative nuclear protein. Following cMLEAD labeling, cells were subsequently stained with ananti-α-tubulin antibody, ananti-acetyl-histone H3 (Lys14) antibody, and DAPI. These staining procedures were designed to spot α-tubulin, acetylated histone H3 (Lys14), and the nucleus, respectively.

Multiplex imaging revealed that the RHO signal predominantly localized to the nucleus (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that acetate-derived protein acylation mainly takes place in the nucleus, consistent with the dominant nuclear distribution of acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), the primary enzyme generating acetyl-CoA from acetate for histone acetylation.25,39,40Noteworthy, the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the RHO signal and acetylated histone H3 signal was 0.62 (Fig. 4B and C), suggesting that ALDH2-generated azidoacetate works as a mimic of native acetate to acylate histones. Additionally, moderate colocalization was observed between the RHO and α-tubulin signals (Pearson's coefficient = 0.63) (Fig. 4D and E), consistent with previous findings that chronic ethanol exposure enhances tubulin acetylation.41This result provides the first direct evidence that upregulated acetylation of α-tubulin is at least partially derived from the carbon source provided by ingested alcohol. All these results confirm the mechanism of cMLEAD, which integrates ALDH2's catalytic conversion of aldehydes to acetate with the cellular metabolic machinery of utilizing acetate for protein acetylation. This highlights the strategy's unique capability to exploit native cellular processes for interrogating enzyme activity.

ALDH2 is implicated in pathological processes such as cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic dysregulation. However, it remains unclear how its activity is regulated under various cellular stresses. Measuring ALDH2 activity is crucial for understanding its dynamic regulation under disease-relevant stress conditions, including oxidative damage, hypoglycemia, and cellular senescence. Such insights could inform the development of ALDH2 activators to mitigate stress-induced damage and restore cellular homeostasis.

With the cMLEAD strategy established, we applied it to investigate how ALDH2 activity responds to cellular stress conditions. We focused on bleomycin-induced senescence and glucose deprivation-induced metabolic stress in HepG2 cells.42,43Cells treated with increasing doses of bleomycin for 48 h exhibited a dose-dependent senescent phenotype, confirmed by β-galactosidase (β-Gal) staining (Fig. 5A and C). cMLEAD labeling revealed a clear inverse correlation between RHO fluorescence intensity and bleomycin concentration (Fig. 5A and D), indicating a progressive reduction in ALDH2 activity during senescence. To validate that this observation was not confounded by global changes in protein acetylation, we performed immunofluorescence staining using the pan-acetyl lysine antibody. No significant difference in protein acetylation levels was observed across treatment groups under the assay conditions (Fig. S15), supporting the ALDH2 activity-dependence of the cMLEAD signal. Moreover, western blot analysis revealed no significant change in ALDH2 protein expression level upon bleomycin exposure (40 μM, 48 h) (Fig. S13). NADH-based ALDH2 assay in cell lysates confirmed the decreasing trend in enzymatic activity, in agreement with the cMLEAD results (Fig. 5E). These findings align with previous reports linking reduced or dysfunctional ALDH2 activity to aging-related pathologies,44and further highlight the utility of cMLEAD for monitoring stress-induced changes in enzyme function in live cells.

To shed light on the mechanism underlying the compromised ALDH2 activity under these stress conditions, we investigated the direct effects of typical oxidative stress-associated metabolites on ALDH2 enzymatic function. Specifically, we assessed the impact of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which accumulates during oxidative stress, using a recombinant ALDH2-based NADH assay. H2O2was found to inhibit ALDH2 activity in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50of 40 μM (Fig. S17). While the precise mechanism underlying the observed reduction in ALDH2 activity under oxidative and senescence-related stress remains to be elucidated, our results suggest that ALDH2 is functionally sensitive to redox modulation. Importantly, cMLEAD enables the detection of such dynamic enzymatic changes in live-cell contexts, providing a valuable tool for monitoring stress-induced alterations in enzyme activity.

The observed decline in ALDH2 activity under oxidative stress and senescence (Fig. 5), along with its established link to aging,44underscores the therapeutic potential of ALDH2 activation for treating aging-related diseases. We observed that cMLEAD sensitively captured Alda-1 mediated activation of ALDH2 in live cells (Fig. 3E), encouraging us to explore its feasibility to screen for ALDH2 activators. Actually, purified recombinant ALDH2 gradually loses activity at low concentrations (Fig. S18). Thus, cellular screening not only maintains enzyme stability but also identifies molecules that enhance activity either directly through allosteric activation or indirectly by increasing cofactors or modulating upstream/downstream events.

Initially, anin silicodocking-based screening was performed on a natural compound library of 2784 structures to prioritize those with the most promising binding to ALDH2 (Table S1). The top 100 candidates were then evaluated using ADMETlab 2.0 to filter out those with unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties,48resulting in 41 promising structures (Table S2). HepG2 cells were incubated with these compounds, followed by cMLEAD labeling (Fig. 6A). Cellular fluorescence was used as a readout of ALDH2 activity (Fig. S19). Setting the vehicle-treated group as the baseline (Fig. 6B), we identified three activators and three inhibitors (Fig. S20–S25). Among these, sennoside A exhibited the most robust activation (Fig. 6C), with cellular fluorescence intensity 10-fold higher than the vehicle group. Further evaluation with cMLEAD determined an EC50of 2.2 μM for sennoside A (Fig. 6D, Eand S20). Moreover, NADH-based ALDH2 activity in cell lysates after sennoside A-pretreatment also verified its activating effect (Fig. 6F). We also confirmed that sennoside A didn't affect the ALDH2's expression levels (Fig. S13), nor did it affect cellular acetylation levels under the assay conditions (Fig. S14). These findings suggest cMLEAD's applicability for screening, and also propose sennoside A as a candidate ALDH2 activator with the exact mode of action to be explored.

Previous studies have demonstrated that ALDH2 can alleviate retinal damage caused by oxidative stress.49To evaluate the activity of sennoside Ain vivo, we employed a light-induced retinal degeneration model in mice. Animals were randomly divided into five groups: control (no light exposure, treated with 5% sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose), model (light exposure, treated with 5% sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose), low-dose sennoside A (light exposure, 100 mg per kg sennoside A), high-dose sennoside A (light exposure, 200 mg per kg sennoside A), and lutein (light exposure, 100 mg per kg lutein as a positive control). Compounds were administered intragastrically for 10 consecutive days. During the last three days of the administration, all groups except the control were first exposed to dark for 36 h, then treated with atropine ophthalmic gel to both eyes, and lastly exposed to 8500–10000 Lux light for 24 h.

A series of tests assessed the protective effects of sennoside A. Elevated plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (Fig. 7A) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (Fig. 7B) in the model group confirmed significant inflammation and oxidative stress induced by light exposure. Notably, high-dose sennoside A markedly alleviated these effects, comparable to the positive control Lutein, suggesting its protective potential. Although the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) assay didn't reach statistical significance, a dose-dependent protective trend was observed (Fig. S26). Since sennoside A is known to exhibit multiple cellular activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects,50,51we interrogated the involvement of ALDH2 in the observed protective effects. Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased ALDH2 expression in retinal tissues from sennoside A-treated group relative to the model group (Fig. 7Cand S27). While short-term sennoside A treatment in HepG2 cells (12 h) did not result in a significant change in ALDH2 protein expression (Fig. S13), chronic administrationin vivo(daily for 10 days) was associated with an upward trend in ALDH2 levels. This observation raises the possibility of a positive feedback mechanism, whereby prolonged ALDH2 activation by sennoside A may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which in turn could stabilize ALDH2 and reduce its degradation. However, further investigation is needed to elucidate the underlying regulatory pathways.

Histopathological evaluation using H&E staining revealed light-induced retinal damage in the model group, characterized by reduced thickness and structural looseness of the outer and inner nuclear layers (Fig. 7D). Both low- and high-dose sennoside A mitigated this damage, preserving retinal morphology and reducing the thinning of the nuclear layers (Fig. 7F and G). TUNEL staining further confirmed retinal cell apoptosis caused by light exposure, indicated by increased red fluorescence in the model group (Fig. 7E). Sennoside A treatment at both doses significantly reduced apoptosis, with effects comparable to Lutein (Fig. 7H). These results validate the protective effects of sennoside A in mitigating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in this light-induced retinal degeneration model. Since sennoside A has been verified to boost cellular ALDH2 activity (Fig. 6E and F), this study underscores the potential of the cMLEAD strategy for identifying candidate ALDH2 activators.

In this study, we developed and rigorously validated the cMLEAD strategy, a metabolically-linked enzymatic activity detection method, for imaging ALDH2 activity in live cells. Integrating azido-tagged acetaldehyde into the native acetylation pathway, cMLEAD enables context-aware visualization of ALDH2 activity in live cells with desirable sensitivity. This strategy addresses the limitations of traditional biochemical assays that lack cellular context and offers a solution for interrogating the activity of enzymes in live cells that tolerate only minimal substrate modifications. cMLEAD exhibited desirable specificity and robustness across a range of conditions. Genetic overexpression and knockdown, as well as pharmacological activation and inhibition, consistently validated the assay's reliability. Application of cMLEAD to stress models such as bleomycin-induced senescence and glucose deprivation revealed that ALDH2 activity is susceptible to oxidative stress, providing new insights into its regulation under pathological conditions. These findings highlight ALDH2's vulnerability in aging and metabolic disorders and underscore the relevance of cMLEAD in mechanistic studies. cMLEAD also proved valuable as a high-content screening platform. Using this strategy, we identified sennoside A as a potential ALDH2 activator with protective efficacy against light-induced retinal degenerationin vivo. This illustrates cMLEAD's translational potential in therapeutic discovery and target validation. Beyond ALDH2, cMLEAD provides a broadly applicable framework for studying enzymes with metabolically converted or unstable substrates, as long as their catalytic products feed into pathways that result in detectable metabolic incorporations. Its adaptability and physiological relevance position it as a powerful tool for enzyme activity mapping, stress biology research, and drug discovery in complex biological systems.

Nonetheless, several limitations of the cMLEAD strategy should be acknowledged. First, cMLEAD provides an indirect readout of enzyme activity that depends not only on ALDH2-mediated transformation but also on subsequent metabolic incorporation steps. As such, appropriate controls and, when possible, orthogonal validation methods are necessary to confirm enzymatic specificity. Second, the assay exhibits a relatively high background signal, which may limit sensitivity. Further optimization, such as reducing nonspecific interactions with the alkyne-functionalized fluorophore, could improve signal-to-noise ratios. Third, while cMLEAD enabled a live-cell screening platform for identifying candidate ALDH2 modulators, additional mechanistic studies are required to validate whether these hits act through direct or indirect modulation of ALDH2 activity.
