Rwanda is among the African countries affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). This scoping review aims to synthesize available information to understand the prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors of NTDs in Rwanda.

Between February and March 2024, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases and grey literature for NTDs articles published between January 1, 1980 and January 31, 2024. Articles were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses Extension for Scoping Review. Relevant data were extracted into Microsoft Word for narrative synthesis.

The search retrieved 2808 articles and 103 were included in this review. Country‐wide prevalence studies were conducted for schistosomiasis, soil‐transmitted helminthiasis (STHs), and podoconiosis. These studies were mostly cross‐sectional. Prevalences ranged from 0%–77.9%, 0%– 92.9%, 0%–4.88%, 0.04%–29.9%, 0.05%–15.3%, and 2%–5% for schistosomiasis, STHs, taeniasis, scabies, trachoma, and onchocerciasis, respectively. Pilot studies on tungiasis and cysticercosis recorded 23% and 13.3% prevalence. Approximately 68.5 per 100,000 people had podoconiosis, and 0.8% of lymphedema cases had lymphatic filariasis. Schistosomiasis, podoconiosis, and STHs were widespread but with varying district endemicity. Mycetoma, leprosy, and rabies lacked geographic distribution profile data while snakebite envenoming data were scarce. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) was not reported in the country from 1990 to 2022. Morbidity was recorded for all the 13 NTDs but reports on mortality were erratic. Cross‐cutting risk factors for some NTDs included socio‐demographic, behavioural, environmental, health‐related, water, sanitation, and hygiene. Gaps exist for risk factors of HAT, mycetoma, rabies, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and snakebites.

Gaps exist for data on country‐wide mapping to understand the burden of some NTDs in Rwanda. Such data is vital for implementing national‐level interventions to achieve NTD elimination or control targets by 2030.

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are predominant in tropical and subtropical areas, among the most vulnerable and marginalized populations imposing human, social, and economic burdens [1]. As of 15 December 2023, the WHO list of NTDs included 21 diseases or groups of diseases globally [2]. In 2021, about 79 countries and territories reported at least one case of NTDs, and more than 1.7 billion people are affected worldwide [1,3,4,5]. One of the global priorities among the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is to end NTD epidemics by 2030 [6].

Approximately 40% of the global burden of NTDs is in Africa [7]. Among the NTDs, schistosomiasis, scabies, and other ectoparasitic infections (tungiasis or Jigger disease), podoconiosis, rabies, snakebite envenoming, trachoma, cysticercosis, mycetoma, lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, and soil‐transmitted helminthiasis (STHs) such as ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm infection are present in Rwanda [8].

Rwanda is a low‐income country with a population size of 13, 246, 394 people composed of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. Among the five provinces, half of the population resides in the Eastern and Southern provinces. The population is largely rural (72.1%) [9]. In 2007, Rwanda launched an NTD control programme targeting STHs, schistosomiasis, trachoma, LF, and onchocerciasis [8]. This set the pace for the implementation of large‐scale NTD control efforts to provide data on the prevalence and public health significance of NTDs in the country [8]. To accelerate actions towards achieving the 2030 global targets for NTDs, WHO has recommended that countries should take ownership of the NTD programme and employ cross‐cutting approaches to reduce costs, and improve efficiency and effectiveness as well as promote equity and sustainability [1]. This can be achieved through an integrated NTD platform for coordinated monitoring and integration of implementation activities. However, there is still a need to synthesize available literature on the burden of NTDs in the country to identify knowledge gaps affecting integrated disease control. To our knowledge, no literature has provided an overview of the burden of NTDs in Rwanda to date. This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors of NTDs in Rwanda. In line with this aim, the following guiding research question was formulated for each NTD specified in Rwanda: What is known from the literature about the disease's prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors? This information will assist in identifying knowledge gaps which are hindering NTD interventions integration in the country and inform the country's NTD research agenda.

This paper reports on the results of a formal scoping review to synthesize evidence regarding the prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors of NTDs in Rwanda. Our choice of a scoping review to synthesize information regarding the prevalence, incidence, distribution morbidity, mortality, and risk factors of NTDs in Rwanda is informed by Munn et al. [10] who recommended a scoping review when the purpose of the review is to identify the types of available evidence or to scope a body of literature in a given field. The protocol for this review is not registered however, the methodology employed in this study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA‐ScR) recommendations [11]. A completed checklist is provided (Supporting Information S1: Table1). The PRISMA‐ScR Flowchart for this review is described in Figure1.

A search strategy was developed to retrieve publications from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar online databases by M.J.M‐M. and N.M. The search strategy for each database is shown in Table1. A search was conducted on various dates between February and March 2024 to identify NTD articles for Rwanda published between the 1st of January 1980 and the 31st of January 2024. In Google Scholar, if retrieved articles were more than 200, the first 200 were considered in the selection process for feasibility purposes. The Google Scholar database's ranking is mainly influenced by relevance and citation, with the most relevant and cited studies appearing within the first few 100 [12]. While this may lead to the omission of relevant studies, we supplemented the search in Google Scholar database with PubMed, Web of Science, which are structured databases. In addition to database searches, grey literature was identified by searching the NTD programme repositories and the Ministry of Health website. We also screened the reference lists to identify additional eligible articles. The literature search was updated in August 2024 to ensure all relevant articles for each NTD were captured. The cut‐off date of 31 January 2024 was meant to provide consistency, thus ensuring a systematic methodology without continuously modifying the inclusion criteria.

The search strategy used in the online databases to identify relevant articles.

All the articles identified were imported into Endnote software X9. The search strategy was designed to retrieve publications meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) original research articles, reviews, and clinical case reports/case studies on human participants reporting the burden of 13 NTDs outlined in the Rwanda NTDs strategic plan 2019‐2024 [8]. (2) articles published in English, and (3) articles published between the 1st of January 1980 and the 31st of January 2024.

Two authors; M.J.M‐M. and N.M. performed the study selection. Initially, the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles for each NTD were manually scanned to exclude articles based on the following exclusion criteria: (1) articles focusing on NTDs in countries other than Rwanda, (2) articles focusing on vaccine, drug and diagnostic development, (3) articles focusing on the biology of the NTDs, (4) Articles not focusing on the specified NTDs. Following article selection through title and abstract, the full texts for the articles meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed for their relevance of evidence in line with our guiding research question.

A data charting (extraction) template was designed in Microsoft Word by M.J.M‐M. and N.M. to collect data answering the guiding question. If an article contained any information relevant to the guiding research question, the data were extracted for synthesis. The data abstraction tool captured the main characteristics of individual studies including the authors' name and year of publication, study site, sample size, study population's age and gender, diagnostic approach, disease prevalence, incidence, disease distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors (Supporting Information S1: Table2). Data for each NTD were then summarised by constructing a narrative about the disease prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors. Disagreements between study selection, data extraction, and narrative were resolved by discussions and consensus among the researchers.

The Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the included articles [13]. We scored all selected studies using the 10 quality control items suggested by the tool. For each item fulfilled, a score of one was awarded while a zero score was awarded for each unmet item. We generated score aggregates and classified studies as either low (0–3), moderate (4–6), or high (7–10) quality [14] (Supporting Information S1: Table3).

In total, 2808 articles were identified (2797 articles from the electronic databases, and 11 from grey literature provided by the NTD programme expert and reference screening). In total, 158 qualified for full‐text review after excluding duplicates and unsuitable articles (Figure1) across the 13 NTDs. Of the 158 articles, 103 had contents used for the narrative synthesis with key findings in Supporting Information S1: Table2. Among the articles, 83.5% were moderate to high quality (Supporting Information S1: Table3). Highlighted in Figure2are the type/s of NTDs that have been studied or reported per district in Rwanda. STHs had the highest number of articles (n= 35), followed by schistosomiasis (n= 29), and the least described disease was onchocerciasis (n= 1) (Table2). The most common studies were cross‐sectional (Table2, Supporting Information S1: Table2). Diagnostic methods varied and included Kato‐Katz (KK) for helminth infections and physical examination for skin diseases. All the NTDs except taeniasis/cysticercosis, scabies, and other ectoparasites and trachoma had epidemiological data at the national level. Schistosomiasis, STHs, podoconiosis, and LF had country‐wide, cross‐sectional data. For other NTDs studies, data were available in retrospective descriptive form from surveillance activities (leprosy and HAT) or case series (e.g., mycetoma, rabies), while some of the country‐wide data were from reviews (n= 9). There are disease prevalence reports for all NTDs in Rwanda except for rabies, snakebite envenoming, and mycetoma. The highest number of studies describing prevalence were those of STHs (n= 34) followed by schistosomiasis (n= 24) and leprosy (n= 17). Although few, all studies for scabies and other ectoparasites, trachoma, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis described prevalence. Incidence was most reported in leprosy studies (n= 17), while most studies describing risk factors (n= 18) and distribution (n= 23) were of STHs. Most morbidity reports were in schistosomiasis studies (n= 14) and leprosy (n= 13). Mortality was the underreported variable, with at most three studies reporting patient outcomes per NTD (Table2).

Map showing the distribution of NTDs' studies in Rwanda reported in the scoping review. Unless the sites were specified in the articles referenced, data extracted from the national database were considered to be reported in all districts. This applies to data for rabies, snakebites, mycetoma and leprosy which were obtained from studies citing the national database.

Twenty‐nine articles provided information on the burden of schistosomiasis in Rwanda [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,94,95,96]. Overall, prevalence ranged from 0% to 77.9% (Table3). In 2008, a national baseline survey revealed a national prevalence of 2.7%, and that intestinal schistosomiasis was endemic in 18/30 districts [15]. Schistosomiasis was mainly along lakes Burera, Ruhondo, Muhazi, and Kivu, with districts ranging from 0%–69.5% prevalence [15,16]. Other studies have also attested to disease heterogeneity [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,40] with Nkombo island in Lake Kivu, Rusizi district, the Western province as the most important foci, recording 77.9% prevalence in one of the sites [21]. Small‐scale studies recorded overall prevalences ranging from 0% to 62.1% [21,23,27,28,29,30], 0.61% to 16.7% [31,32,33], and 0% to 69% [22,34,35], among the districts in the Western, Northern, and Eastern provinces respectively. Across the country, disease incidence rates ranged from 0 to 30.4 per 100,000 persons among the districts and a health facility service area in Burera district,Northern province, was identified as the most likely cluster for schistosomiasis transmission across the country [40]. Earlier, low schistosomiasis incidence was reported in northwestern Rwanda [94].

Snakebites were recorded but snakebite envenoming was not recorded.

Dog bites were recorded but the number of rabies cases among the bites was not specified.

In Bugesera district, Eastern province, a 0% prevalence was reported among preschool‐aged children (PSAC) using the KK method and 9.5% by the point of care‐circulating cathodic antigen (POC‐CCA) test [34]. The POC‐CCA test and KK had the same discrepancy among PSAC from 17 districts classified as moderate to high‐risk endemic for schistosomiasis in the country (24% vs 0.8% respectively) [20]. Discrepancies between POC‐CCA and KK results were also reported in other studies in Rwanda [17,18,27].

Modelling estimates showed the reported national prevalence was 2.2% in 2010 [36], 15.3% in 2013 [37], 1.8% in 2014 [36], 3.8% in 2015 [38] and 0.9% in 2019 [36]. Analysis of multi‐year cross‐sectional data in 2019 showed that the country had reached elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem after a maximum of three treatment rounds [39]. Despite reports of noS. haematobiumdetected in some studies in 2008 [15,25], some predictions later on indicated the presence of urinary schistosomiasis in Rwanda [37,38].

Risk factors specific to the PSAC were accompanying parents and older children to the lake [34], age, bathing in water bodies and being looked after by older siblings [27]. Generally, risk factors included environmental parameters such as proximity to water bodies [15,36,40], wetland conditions [38,40], rain [36,38,40], in‐terrain shape [40], temperature [38,40], normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [18,37], isothermality [36], humid agro‐ecological areas [36], low and high altitude [37]. Behavioural risk factors included rice cultivation or agricultural activities in swamps [26,40], no use of shoes, and use of water bodies [26]. In addition, demographic (being male) [18], and health‐related risk factors such as high infant mortality [38], and coinfection with other helminths [19] were also identified.

Thirty‐five studies described the burden of STHs in Rwanda [15,19,21,22,23,24,25,30,32,33,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,97]. Prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 95.2% (Table3). In 2008, an overall STH prevalence of 65.8% was documented [15]. Prevalence was heterogeneous among the districts. Single species prevalences ranged from 27% (Trichuris trichiura)to 38.6% forAscaris lumbricoides[15]. However, health facility‐based incidence data for the same period showed that while STH incidence was variable,T. trichiuracontributed to most infections [40]. The reassessment survey of 2014 showed thatA. lumbricoidesprevalence remained high (37.54%) whileT. trichiuraslightly declined (23.16%) and hookworm infections declined significantly (4.54%) [17]. The widespread and heterogeneous distribution of STHs across the provinces, districts, and within the districts was shown in many studies [19,21,23,24,33,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47].AscarisandT. trichiurawere reported as high in the western and the north‐western parts of the country in 2008 [15], while in 2014 concordant infection patterns were observed among the two parasites in the Northern, Western, and South‐western parts of the country [41]. Hookworms were reported as the only STH more pronounced in the eastern areas [15,19]. Hookworms were ubiquitous in the country but had low incidence [40]. In 2015, a national prevalence of 62.6% was estimated through modelling [48], while a cross‐sectional study in 2020 documented a prevalence of 41% [47].

In the Southern province, district documented prevalences ranged between 0.3%–8.2%, 0.4%–7.1%, and 3.3%–81% for hookworms,T. trichiura, andA. lumbricoidesrespectively [43,44,49,50,51,52]. A similar trend was observed in the Eastern province as follows: 0.16%–33%, 0.76%–22%, and 4.43%–86.6% for hookworms,T. trichiura, andA. lumbricoides, respectively [22,45,46,53,54]. In the Northern and Western provinces, trichuriasis was more prominent than any other STH. In the Northern province, the trend was as follows: 0%–23.2% hookworms, 0%–86.5%A. lumbricoides, and 1%–91.9%T. trichiura[32,33,55,56]. The trend in the Western province was also as follows: 0.6%–11.6% hookworms, 13.1%–63.3%A. lumbricoidesand < 1%–92.9%T. trichiura[21,30,42,57,58,59,60,61]. In Kigali city, Gasabo district, a study among tertiary students showed a 20% prevalence ofA. lumbricoidesand 1.8% hookworms [62].

STHs infections were of either light, moderate, or high intensity [21,32,42,55]. Signs and symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anaemia, nausea and vomiting, cough, poor appetite, stunting, and low Hb levels were noted [33,43,49,62]. Intestinal obstruction due toAscarisled to death [63]. Co‐infections of STHs with malaria were noted to significantly increase malaria severity [53].

Some of the risk factors for STHs infection identified in Rwanda include water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) related factors such as insufficient/poor water use or use of unsafe water [33,49,56,58,62,97], poor sanitation [33,49,97], and poor hygiene [33,49,56,57,61]. Socioeconomic status‐related risk factors were farming [57,58], pig husbandry [43,49], using human faeces as fertilizer [30], parental illiteracy [43,51,57], absence of electricity, non‐improved household floor [49], population density and proportion of rural residents [40]. Demographic risk factors included age [19], sex, district of residence [42], and living outside the teaching institution [62]. Behavioural risk factors were consumption of bitter leaves and bare feet walking [43]. Environmental predictors of STHs infection included lower and higher elevation, higher moisture [19], Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) [41], sand proportion and pH, rainfall, wetlands and their uses [40]. Individual health‐related risk factors included coinfection with other parasites [19,42,45], detectable HIV viral load, low CD4 count, and use of certain types of antiretroviral therapy regimen [45] and stunting [42].

Twelve relevant articles were retrieved for taeniasis/cysticercosis burden in Rwanda [33,52,55,57,64,65,66,67,98,99,100,101]. None of the studies reported a nationwide burden of taeniasis/cysticercosis. Documented prevalence from pilot studies ranged from 0.3%–4.88% taeniasis and 0.9%–23.3%% cysticercosis (Table3). In the Northern province, taeniasis prevalence ranged from 0% to 4.88% among the districts [33,55,64]. A study recorded 13.3% cysticercosis (T. solium‐specific serum antibodies) prevalence of whom 38.0% had viable cysticercus [64]. In the Western province, Nyamasheke district, a prevalence of 1.4% taeniasis was recorded in 2023 [57], In the Southern province, 0.8%–0.9% of infections were recorded [52,65], while 1.4% of the patients had neurocysticercosis with residents from Huye and Nyaruguru districts being the most affected [66] and 10% of epileptic patients had anticysticercal antibodies [67]. In the same province, a case of disseminated cysticercosis was also identified in the Kamonyi district [98]. Cases of cysticercosis have also been reported in other districts [99,100,101]. While Taenia infection morbidity was not identified in other individuals [55], others presented with abdominal pain [33], epilepsy, headaches focal neurological deficit, signs of increased intracranial pressure, sub‐cutaneous nodules, fever, tachycardic [66,67,98,99,100,101], and complications such as lower limb weakness causing difficulty walking [98]. Five mortalities were recorded in one study [66].

Risk factors specific to taeniasis/cysticercosis are undocumented in Rwanda. However, poor sanitation [33], poor hygiene [33,57], and illiteracy [57] are predisposing factors documented for intestinal helminths.

Four articles documented the burden of scabies and tungiasis [8,65,68,69]. Prevalences for scabies recorded in the country ranged between 0.04% to 29.9% across different districts [8,65,68]. In one of the Southern districts, tungiasis (caused byTunga penetrans) had a prevalence of 23% with a significant difference between males (60%) and females (40%) [69], While none of the studies reported on mortality due to scabies and other ectoparasites, tungiasis resulted in poor class attendance due to difficulty in walking, poor performance in school due to lack of concentration, stigma, and isolation [69]. Scabies generally presented with impetigo [65]. There were no national‐wide studies on the burden of scabies and other ectoparasites. There were also no records of risk factors for scabies in Rwanda. Walking bare‐footed, having dirty feet, wearing dirty clothes, irregular wearing of shoes, and living in a house with earthen‐plastered floor predisposed toT. penetransinfection [69].

Five articles provided relevant data on the burden of podoconiosis in Rwanda [47,70,102,103,104]. These studies showed a prevalence range of 16.8–216.2 per 100,000 population (Table3). A recent population‐based survey showed that 68.5 per 100,000 people have podoconiosis in Rwanda, with heterogeneity among the districts ranging from 28·3 per 100,000 people (16·8–45·5, Nyarugenge, Kigali province) to 119·2 per 100,000 people (59·9–216·2, Nyamasheke, West province) [70]. A survey among podoconiosis patients showed that 54.4% were from Musanze and 34.9% from Burera districts [102]. None of the studies reported mortality data on podoconiosis but morbidity such as lymphoedema [70], not being able to walk due to painful feet and legs [47,70] Irreversible foot or leg swelling at a late stage, burning sensations, itching, lump, widening of the foot, shallow skin folds, plantar oedema, knocking of big toes, and large second toes [103]. Age, an increased number of relatives with podoconiosis [102], walking bare‐footed [103], and an elevation of 1000–2500 m above sea level, acid soils and soils rich in clay and silt [104] were identified as risk factors.

Two relevant articles were retrieved for LF burden in Rwanda [70,71]. Recorded prevalence ranged from 0.1% to 0.8% (Table3). One person from Rwamagana was found positive for LF in a survey conducted in five districts [71]. Another study reported that 9/1143 patients with lymphoedema across the country were positive for LF [70]. Incidence, mortality, and risk factors relating to LF are undocumented in Rwanda.

Three studies relevant to the burden of trachoma in Rwanda were retrieved [73,74,75]. There are no reports of a nation‐wide survey, though pilot studies show a prevalence range of 0.05% to 20.8% (Table3). Documented prevalence ranged from 0.05%–15.3% [73,74,75]. Gatsibo and Nyaruguru districts were the most affected (15.3% and 12.6% respectively) [74]. Signs and symptoms include trachomatous inflammation‐follicular, corneal opacity, and trichiasis [74,75]. There are no data on trachoma incidence and mortality in Rwanda. The risk factor identified for trachoma infections was unclean faces [73].

One relevant study was retrieved for the burden of onchocerciasis (caused byOnchocerca volvulus)in Rwanda [76]. In 1999, 14.3% of the villages surveyed had cases of onchocerciasis with a community onchorcercal nodule rate of 2% to 5%. Data for incidence, mortality, and risk factors were not available.

Ten relevant studies were retrieved for the burden of HAT, caused byTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiensein Rwanda [8,24,47,105,107,108,109,110,111]. No prevalence studies have been conducted in the country, but surveillance data and case reports showed there has been no transmission of HAT in Rwanda from 1990 to 2022 [24,47,105,106]. These reports show that the HAT was previously transmitted in the Akagera National Park and the former Umutara. However, other studies have reported cases during the same period [8,107,108,109,110,111]. Patients presented with signs and symptoms such as headache, cervical posterior lymphadenopathy, fever, splenomegaly, trypanosomal chancre, mental confusion, agitation, anorexia, raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure and bilateral papilloedema, generalized hyperaesthesia, nonspecific T‐wave inversion in the precordial leads, supraventricular multifocal ectopic rhythm, cerebromeningeal trypanosomiasis, long diurnal naps, rapid eye movement sleep at the end of sleep episodes, in transitory arousal phases concomitant with myoclonic jerks, persistent slow waves during slow‐wave sleep [107,108,109,110,111]. Mortality status was recorded in other studies [108,109,111]. No studies have explored the risk factors of HAT in the country.

Four relevant articles were retrieved for reports on snakebites in Rwanda [8,72,112,113]. There were no prevalence studies on snakebites or snakebite envenoming in Rwanda. The national database showed that 14% of animal bites/stings during 2017 and 2018 were snakebites [72], while in 2019 there were > 1000 cases [8]. In addition, snakebite victims for the year 2017/2018 were distributed across all five provinces [112], with most cases reported in the Eastern Province, followed by Kigali city, Western Province, Southern Province, and Northern Province [72]. A recent study in the Eastern province revealed that 81.6% of 732 survivors of snake biting engage in agricultural activities [113]. While none of the studies reported the rate of envenoming, signs and symptoms of snakebites included swelling, pain, numbness/paralysis, fever/chills, sweating, drooling, difficulty swallowing, uncontrolled bleeding, dizziness, blurred vision, itching, and skin reactions [72,112]. Snakebites also result in fear or anxiety, interrupted schooling, food insecurity, lasting physical limitations/pain that compromise income generation, and miscarriages [113]. Risk factors of snakebite envenoming are not well documented in Rwanda. A study on snake‐biting survivors revealed that biting occurred when they were outdoors and had poor visibility [112]. There are no documented data on mortality due to snakebite envenoming.

There are no epidemiological studies for mycetoma in Rwanda except for two case reports [8,114]. Before 2019, < 5 cases were reported in 5 years [8]. In 2021, a case study reported that a patient had presented with an abdominal mass with intermittent fever and severe pain due to mycetoma and survived after treatment [114]. However, in both reports, there is no further information on the places of origin of the patients. No study has also explored the risk factors of mycetoma in Rwanda.

Three articles were found relevant to describing the burden of rabies in Rwanda [8,72,115]. There are currently no epidemiological studies on rabies in the country, however, in 1981 a 28‐year‐old female died from rabies contracted through a dog bite in Kigali [115]. Following infection, she experienced fever, paresthesias, lethargy with paresis of arms and legs, dysarthria, bilateral facial paresis, flaccid quadriplegia and eventually went into coma. In 2017/2018, national data suggests that 78% of animal bites were due to dog bites [72], while > 500 cases of dog bites were reported between 2016 and 2019 [8]. No study has explored the prevalence and risk factors of rabies in Rwanda.

Nineteen articles were found relevant for the study [77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,116]. Prevalence and the emergence of new leprosy cases fluctuated between 1982 and 2019 (range 0.005–60 per 10,000 population) [Table3]. From 2004 until the end of 2019, the highest prevalence per population was recorded in the beginning of 2009 [77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88]. Trend analysis from 1995 to 2011 showed a prevalence rate of 0.005 per 10,000 population [89]. Until 1995, the prevalence rate ranged between 0.08 and 1.5, with the highest recorded in 1989 [90,91,92,93]. Grade 2 disabilities were recorded in many of these studies [77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,116]. None of the studies recorded data on mortality and risk factors of leprosy in Rwanda.

The publication trend of NTDs in Rwanda between 1980 and January 2024 is shown in Figure3. Overall, there were few publications during the period from 1980 to 2004. Podoconiosis, LF, snakebite envenoming, trachoma, STHs, and mycetoma had no publications during this period, while for rabies and leprosy, the publications were case reports. There were no NTD publications at all between 2000 and 2004. The publication rate increased from 2005 onwards. Between 2015 and 2024, STHs had the highest number of publications (n= 27), followed by schistosomiasis (n= 21). Onchocerciasis only had a single article published in 1999.

Publication trend of NTDs in Rwanda for the period of 1980 to January 2024. Key: HAT = human African trypanosomiasis; LF = lymphatic filariasis, SBE = snakebite envenoming, SCH = schistosomiasis, STHs = soil‐transmitted helminthiasis, S&T = scabies and tungiasis, T/C = taeniasis/cysticercosis. Publication trend is shown at 5‐year intervals. For snakebite envenoming, the data presented is for snakebites only not envenoming.

This scoping review mapped the volume of available evidence on the burden of NTDs specified in Rwanda. It covers 103 articles on the prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors for NTDs in Rwanda. Some NTDs, such as schistosomiasis and STHs, are well documented. However, many of the NTDs lack comprehensive epidemiological data that is an evidence base for targeted interventions and monitoring and evaluation of the progress thereafter.

Tremendous efforts in mapping schistosomiasis and STHs in the country have paved the way for the introduction of necessary interventions with continuous mass drug administration in the country since the first countrywide survey in 2008 [8,15]. The persistent transmission of these two NTDs in other parts of the country and mostly in similar settings calls for cross‐cutting and integrated interventions including community‐focused strengthening of social and behaviour change communication, provision of adequate WASH facilities and specifically for schistosomiasis‐ snail control. These activities should be complemented by research on snail mapping, assessment of community beliefs, behaviour, assets, and influencers of infection, mapping of WASH facilities and their status, and enhancing the current monitoring and evaluation activities. Also noted is that most of the studies focused on school‐aged children, with only a few including the adult population and the PSAC. Such limitations make it challenging to quantify disease burden and monitor the effects of intervention strategies on the excluded age groups. Previously, we have provided epidemiological evidence justifying the inclusion of these population age groups in schistosomiasis control programmes in Zimbabwe [117,118,119].

Risk factors for STHs relating to poverty, poor hygiene, sanitation and lack of water noted in Rwanda have also been reported elsewhere [120,121], with similar risk of using open freshwater bodies as a predisposition to schistosomiasis infection [121]. Thus, to alleviate STHs and schistosomiasis burden in the country, there is a need for the improvement of socioeconomic status, WASH facilities, and strengthening of behaviour change communication to promote public awareness on health and hygiene coupled with MDA for the elimination of these NTDs [120]. Some of the risk factors, such as lack or insufficient WASH and low socioeconomic status, are cross‐cutting for most of the NTDs. Therefore, interventions targeting those factors will likely improve the quality of life of the affected population.

We noted that the baseline prevalence of schistosomiasis in Rwanda is lower than records in Gambia [122] and Ethiopia [123], while the STHs prevalence in Rwanda is higher than in these two countries. These differences are due to variations in environmental factors, availability of water bodies and intermediate hosts, socioeconomic factors, variations in healthcare systems and control programs, cultural practices, and behaviour [124,125]. These factors also explain the heterogeneous distribution of the disease observed within Rwanda.

Currently, we are not aware of any nationwide epidemiological study aimed at providing information on the overall burden of taeniasis/cysticercosis in Rwanda. The documented small‐scale studies provide an incomplete picture of the epidemiology of taeniasis/cysticercosis, thereby hindering the implementation of effective disease control, prevention, and management strategies. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the highest taeniasis prevalence reported in Rwanda (4.88%) [33], falls within the range of taeniasis prevalences that have been recorded in other studies in the Eastern and Southern African region [126] and higher than what has been recorded in Madagascar (2.4%) [127]. Anti‐cysticercal antibody prevalence in Rwanda was lower than in Madagascar (29.8%). Nevertheless,T. soliumcarriers should be given attention and treated early as they pose a risk to themselves (when they ingest infective eggs) and to other people in contact [127].

The epidemiological evidence available on scabies in Rwanda is within the global range of prevalence ranging from 0.18% to 76.9% [128]. However, there is still need for extensive epidemiological studies to understand disease distribution and predisposing factors, enhance surveillance systems, and improve the capacity of disease diagnosis, management, and prevention.

Data for mycetoma, snakebite envenoming, and rabies are scarce. For onchocerciasis, the only data available is from a study that was conducted in 1999, while trachoma mapping was conducted in a few selected districts. The limited availability of epidemiological data on these NTDs will hinder a comprehensive understanding of their landscape in the country. Thus, studies including surveillance efforts to assess epidemiological indicators such as prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, and mortality and identify risk factors and at‐risk populations for these NTDs are necessary to institute informed and targeted interventions. Other NTDs such as HAT, taeniasis/cysticercosis, tungiasis, STHs, and rabies will require multisectoral collaborations involving human health, animal health and environmental sectors to understand the underlying factors in their transmission.

Building upon the nation‐wide study on podoconiosis in Rwanda, longitudinal studies will be required to understand disease dynamics, evaluate the effect of interventions and potential challenges in disease control over time. Additionally, investigations should be undertaken to understand environmental and genetic factors contributing to podoconiosis susceptibility and transmission in Rwanda. While lymphatic filariasis has been ruled out as a public health problem in the country [71], it is critical to understand its transmission dynamics through vector mapping and identification of potential reservoirs of the parasite to provide insights into resurgence risk and guide targeted interventions.

The latest data in 2019 shows that snakebite cases are significant in Rwanda [8]. However, a further distinction will be necessary to identify snakebite envenoming among all snake bites reported. Research is also critical to explore snakebite prevalence, trends, morbidity, mortality, risk factors, and variation in envenoming in the country. Some snakebite victims do not report to health facilities [112]. Thus, proactive monitoring through the collection of data in the community for a comprehensive understanding of snakebites epidemiology is critical to inform improved strategies for their prevention, control, and management in Rwanda.

Morbidity and mortality data are necessary for enhancing understanding of the burden posed by NTDs. However, gaps exist in reporting patient outcomes for NTD infections in Rwanda. The morbidity indicators, signs, and symptoms for diseases such as schistosomiasis, STHs, podoconiosis, lymphatic filariasis, and cysticercosis are consistent with what has been recorded in other settings [124,127,129,130,131]. However, data on mortality are mostly absent, highlighting a gap in the surveillance of NTDs in Rwanda. Such data is critical for informed targeted control and resource allocation.

From 1980 to 2004, there were few NTD publications in Rwanda due to limited research attention on these diseases. The surge in the number of NTD publications from the mid‐2000 onwards is a reflection of the improved global and national attention to these diseases following WHO recommendations to accelerate efforts to control and eliminate NTDs [132]. It is also a reflection of increased research capacity and prioritization of NTDs in Rwanda.

According to the NTDs roadmap, the NTDs in Rwanda [8], are either targeted for elimination or control by the year 2030 [1]. Figure2shows that none of the districts in Rwanda have been screened for all the specified NTDs in the country. Other NTDs such as rabies, mycetoma, HAT, snakebite envenoming, and leprosy rely on the national database records and case reports, which require further synthesis. The gap in the comprehensive screening of these NTDs results in a data dearth that hinders the development of evidence‐based policies, necessary resource allocation, and consequently, the implementation of integrated and systematic approaches, impeding the country's progress towards the achievement of the goals of the NTD roadmap.

Findings in this scoping review call for research prioritization, focusing on those NTDs with scarce epidemiological data in Rwanda so that the country will be informed on resource allocation and targeted, sustainable interventions. A robust NTD‐focused surveillance system in Rwanda is also necessary to facilitate the monitoring of NTDs in the country. The system should include epidemiological tracking of all NTDs by integrating their data into the national health information systems. Rwanda is also at an increased risk for introduction of new diseases including NTDs and/or their vectors due to the influx of tourists and travellers. Thus, the NTD surveillance system should have early detection, warning, and response mechanisms to prevent potential outbreaks, and the spread of NTDs in the local population. Capacity building of health personnel to enhance skills in surveillance, diagnosis, reporting, prevention, and control of NTDs is vital for improved health and well‐being of the Rwandan population. Community engagement and awareness should also be considered to increase people's knowledge of NTDs, and their prevention and control methods, and empower communities to break transmission of NTDs.

Our literature search and selection criteria enhanced the reproducibility of the study methodology. However, our review was limited by focusing on only published English literature and may have resulted in excluding valuable findings from non‐English publications.

This scoping review sheds light on the current evidence on the prevalence, incidence, distribution, morbidity, mortality, and risk factors of NTDs in Rwanda. Schistosomiasis and STHs have received much focus in the country, and the findings from the study have been relevant for planning and implementing control programs. The recommendations for improvement made will assist in optimizing the control program for the interruption of transmission of these two NTDs in Rwanda. However, the lack of robust epidemiological data on most of the NTDs in the country will likely hinder the development of evidence‐based public health interventions tailored to the unique needs of Rwandans. The provision of epidemiological data will assist in improving strategies for the prevention, control, and management of NTDs in the country through effective planning, resource allocation, and capacity‐building efforts.
