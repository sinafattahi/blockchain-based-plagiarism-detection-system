Prior epidemiological studies have consistently shown that Black Americans experience a disproportionate burden of venous thromboembolism (VTE), yet mechanistic explanations remain elusive. In this large, nationwide study involving 142,456 hospitalized veterans, Lin et al1sought to identify demographic, clinical, and social factors contributing to racial differences in VTE incidence within 90 days of hospital admission.

Well, initial models adjusting for race alone showed that Black race was associated with a 17% increased odds of VTE (odd ratio [OR], 1.17). This association remained statistically significant (OR, 1.13;P= .001), even after adjusting for potential confounders including age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, pharmacological prophylaxis, and ethnicity.

To further refine their analysis, the authors examined more than 100 additional variables. Four emerged as key modifiers of the race-VTE relationship: Social Deprivation Index, blood type, hemoglobin concentration, and surgery type. Among these, hemoglobin concentration had the most profound impact. Lower hemoglobin levels were associated independently with a higher VTE risk, demonstrating a consistent inverse relationship. Once hemoglobin was added to the model, the association between Black race and VTE lost statistical significance (OR, 1.06;P= .14). Black patients also had lower average hemoglobin levels, suggesting that anemia may mediate the observed racial disparity partially.

However, the study lacked sufficient granularity to evaluate specific causes of anemia such as sickle cell disease—an important omission given its higher prevalence among Black individuals and known prothrombotic potential. This limitation restricts a more comprehensive understanding of the biologic pathways involved.

Equally noteworthy is what the study did not find. Despite common assumptions that socioeconomic factors drive racial health disparities, the Social Deprivation Index was not predictive of VTE, whether treated as a continuous or categorical variable. This finding challenges the prevailing view that social disadvantage alone accounts for disparate outcomes and suggests a need to explore biologic and care delivery factors more closely. Similarly, although blood type and surgery type were associated with VTE risk independently, their inclusion did not meaningfully alter the race-VTE association.

Limitations include the predominantly male veteran population, potentially limiting generalizability. Moreover, hemoglobin may serve only as a surrogate for other underlying factors not captured in the dataset. This study highlights the persistent racial disparities in VTE and points to hemoglobin concentration—and possibly anemia—as key mediators. These findings support incorporating anemia assessment into VTE risk evaluation, particularly for Black patients, and call for continued research into biologic contributors to thrombosis.
