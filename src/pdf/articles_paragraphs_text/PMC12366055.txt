Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a therapeutic strategy for refractory cardiogenic shock. However, it is associated with a high risk of complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), which increases the need of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and is linked to worse clinical outcomes.

To identify clinical and biochemical factors independently associated with the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in adult patients receiving veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).

A retrospective case–control study that included patients who received VA-ECMO and were admitted to the intensive care unit between 2019 and 2023. The incidence of RRT, along with associated severity and mortality scores, was analyzed using multivariate analysis.

A total of 279 patients were included, among whom 98 received VA-ECMO support. Of these, 26.5% required RRT, and the mortality rate was 57.7%. The majority of patients were male (62.2%), with a mean age of 45.3 years (SD ± 13.8). Factors associated with the need for RRT included the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00–1.06), history of hypothyroidism (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.27–12.86), and elevated creatinine levels prior to ECMO initiation (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12–2.09). Additionally, the APACHE II score (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98–1.10) and renal angina index (OR, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.77–15.77) were predictors of mortality.

Patients undergoing VA-ECMO who require RRT have a high mortality risk. Associated factors include hypothyroidism, elevated creatinine levels before ECMO initiation, and a higher renal angina index. The early identification of these factors may facilitate the early detection of AKI risk and optimize clinical management.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most frequent and severe complications in patients receiving veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), with an incidence reported at 50.5% and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) occurring in approximately 44.3% of cases [1]. When AKI progresses to the need of renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality rates may exceed 80% [2–4]. Additionally, fluid overload—particularly volumes greater than 5 L—has been independently associated with increased mortality in this population [5,6].

The development of AKI in this context is multifactorial. VA-ECMO triggers a systemic inflammatory response due to blood contact with non-endothelial surfaces, promoting endothelial dysfunction and both microvascular and macrovascular injury [7,8]. Furthermore, alterations in renal perfusion—including changes in afferent and efferent arteriolar tone—reduce glomerular filtration, while ischemia-reperfusion injury contributes to acute tubular necrosis [7–11]. These pathophysiological mechanisms are compounded by the hemodynamic instability, nephrotoxic exposure, and baseline comorbidities frequently present in critically ill patients.

Although VA-ECMO is most often implemented in the setting of cardiogenic shock—such as post-cardiotomy, fulminant myocarditis, or myocardial infarction—the renal consequences of extracorporeal support extend beyond the underlying cardiac condition [12–14]. Despite the high incidence and poor outcomes associated with ECMO-related AKI, there is not yet well understood which clinical and biochemical variables are most predictive of RRT initiation in this setting. We hypothesized that specific variables would be independently associated with the need for RRT. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and biochemical factors associated with the initiation of RRT among patients receiving VA-ECMO.

This was a retrospective case–control study conducted at Fundación Clínica Shaio (Bogotá D.C., Colombia), between August 8, 2019, and March 30, 2023. The study included patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who received veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) therapy.

Patients aged > 18 years who were admitted to the ICU with an indication for VA-ECMO therapy according to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO®) criteria were included [12]. Two groups were defined for comparison. The cases were patients who developed stage 3 AKI based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria and required RRT [15], and the control were patients who received VA-ECMO during the same period but did not require RRT. Renal Angina Index (RAI), APACHE II, SOFA, and DEOx scores were calculated according to the original studies [16–22]. Mortality data were extracted from death registry notifications.

Absence of sufficient clinical documentation for analysis.

Preexisting renal conditions: History of chronic kidney disease, history of prior RRT, Unclear diagnosis of acute-on-chronic kidney injury, History of kidney transplantation.

Special populations: Pediatric patients, pregnant women.

Clinical data were collected using a standardized electronic case report form (eCRF) within the REDCap®platform [23]. All data were verified by the research team for consistency and completeness.

The need for RRT was determined by the nephrology team based on institutional criteria: BUN > 100 mg/dL, hyperkalemia > 6 mEq/L with ECG changes, hypermagnesemia > 8 mEq/L, metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.15), anuria, or fluid overload refractory to diuretics [15,24–27].

AKI was diagnosed according to the KDIGO criteria, which defined this condition as an increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL, an increase in serum creatinine of at least 1.5 times its baseline value within the previous seven days, or a urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h during a six-hour period [15,28,29]. Additionally, norepinephrine was used as a first-line vasopressor before the initiation of ECMO. If the required dose exceeded 0.25 mcg/kg/min, a second vasopressor was added. However, the study database did not record the specific dose of each vasopressor administered.

VA-ECMO procedures were performed following institutional protocols under the guidance of the cardiovascular surgery team. Cannulation was predominantly peripheral, using the femoral artery and femoral or internal jugular vein. Central cannulation was reserved for selected post-cardiotomy cases. The type and location of cannulation were recorded in the REDCap®registry for all patients.

Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities (assessed using the Charlson index), clinical variables upon admission, and paraclinical and gasometric findings were analyzed [30]. Baseline creatinine data were collected upon admission, including the lowest level within the past 6 months. The need for RRT was defined by the nephrology department according to established criteria, and data were collected retrospectively. The presence of renal angina (RA) was determined after 12 h of admission, as described in the original study, using the worst creatinine (SCr/Base changes) with a binary definition or as a percentage of fluid overload (%FO) since ICU admission. A positive RA was defined as a value ≥ 8 [21] (Supplement1– Renal Angina Index calculation – RAI) [22]. Additionally, the APACHE II, SOFA, and DEOx scores were calculated as recommended by their original studies within the first 24 h of admission [16–18] (Supplement1– Oxygen Debt Calculation - DEOx). The study also analyzed the number of days of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and ECMO flow over 24 h. The data were reviewed by the research team to verify that the entry criteria for each subject were met and to ensure that there were no inconsistent data or errors in the calculation of severity scores.

The sample size was calculated based on a case–control design using the formula proposed by Connor for independent groups [31]. Estimates were derived from both institutional pilot data and literature-reported proportions of RRT use in ECMO patients. According to Thongprayoon et al. [32], the pooled incidence of RRT in ECMO-supported patients was approximately 44.9%. Using this as the expected proportion in the case group and an estimated 13.5% RRT requirement in controls based on internal data, the following parameters were applied: odds ratio of 5.03, confidence level of 95%, power of 90%, and a control-to-case ratio of approximately 3:1. With Yates’ continuity correction, the required sample size was determined to be 102 patients.

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA software version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline characteristics. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviations (SD) for normally distributed data, or as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for non-normally distributed data. The normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test.

Bivariate comparisons were made between patients who required renal replacement therapy (RRT) and those who did not. For continuous variables, we used the Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test depending on distribution. For categorical variables, the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was applied as appropriate.

Variables with a p-value < 0.20 in the bivariate analysis, along with those considered biologically plausible, were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of RRT. Associations were reported as odds ratios (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) [33,34].

The discriminatory ability of severity scores—including the Renal Angina Index (RAI), APACHE II, SOFA, and DEOx—was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR−) for each score. AUCs were compared using the DeLong test. To control for multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant throughout all analyses.

This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Fundación Clínica Shaio, Bogotá D.C., Colombia (approval code DIB 23–40). It was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. Due to the retrospective design and use of anonymized data, the requirement for informed consent was waived.

A total of 279 patients received ECMO support between August 2019 and March 2023. After applying predefined exclusion criteria—including chronic kidney disease, prior renal replacement therapy (RRT), incomplete clinical records, and early ICU mortality—a final cohort of 98 patients who received veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) and had complete clinical data was included in the analysis. Of these, 26 patients (26.5%) developed stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) and required RRT, while 72 did not. The overall mortality rate among patients who received RRT was 57.7% (n= 15). The inclusion process is detailed in Fig.1.

The mean age of the cohort was 45.3 years (SD 13.8), and 62.2% were male. Patients who required RRT had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI), longer ICU stays, more days on mechanical ventilation, and increased mortality compared to those who did not require RRT (57.7% vs. 29.2%,p= 0.010). Moreover, comorbidities such as hypothyroidism were more prevalent in the RRT group. Other clinical variables significantly associated with RRT in bivariate analysis included the APACHE II score and the presence of renal angina. Table1summarizes the characteristics of the population and their relationship with RRT (Supplement1– Etiologies of patients with VA-ECMO).

Pre-ECMO serum creatinine (Scr) and potassium levels showed statistically significant differences between patients who required RRT and those who did not. Similarly, fluid balance within 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days of ECMO was associated with the need for RRT. Table2summarizes the paraclinical and fluid characteristics of RRT.

Multivariate analysis identified the need for RRT in patients receiving VA-ECMO support as an independent variable significantly associated with hypothyroidism (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.21–12.86;p= 0.018) and renal angina (OR, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.77–15.77;p= 0.003), as shown in Table3.

The AUC for DEOx in predicting RRT was 0.720 (95% CI, 0.66–0.77), with a specificity of 58.1%. The DeLong test for comparing the areas under the curve in predicting RRT yielded a value of 0.168 (Bonferroni adjustment,p= 0.084). Table4; Fig.2present the performance results for each score in relation to RRT.

Patients with VA-ECMO requiring RRT presented with several associated factors, including hypothyroidism, elevated pre-ECMO creatinine levels, and renal angina. In addition, these patients had higher mortality rates, and longer durations of mechanical ventilation. Renal abnormalities associated with the need for RRT included elevated pre-ECMO potassium levels and positive fluid balance. The DEOx score showed acceptable predictive capacity.

Iglesias et al., in a study of 35 patients, reported an 80% prevalence of AKI in those with thyroid disorders, with low T3 syndrome being the most common abnormality, observed in 65% of cases [35]. Low T3 syndrome, a well-recognized condition in critically ill patients, has been associated with adverse renal outcomes Hypothyroidism can contribute to impaired renal hemodynamics through several interconnected mechanisms. These include reduced cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, and diminished renal plasma flow, which collectively decrease glomerular filtration and increase susceptibility to AKI. These effects are mediated both metabolically and systemically, with preglomerular vasoconstriction playing a central role in limiting renal perfusion and promoting prerenal injury. Furthermore, thyroid hormones are known to influence endothelial function, renin-angiotensin system activity, and sodium-water balance, all of which may further affect renal autoregulation during critical illness [35,36]. Although our study identified hypothyroidism as an independent risk factor for RRT in VA-ECMO patients, no previous studies have specifically examined this association in ECMO-supported populations. Nonetheless, the pathophysiological basis linking thyroid dysfunction and renal injury in critical illness is well established. Given the novelty of our findings in this setting, further studies are warranted to validate and elucidate the relationship between hypothyroidism and the need for RRT in patients undergoing VA-ECMO.

Vinclair et al. identified factors associated with major adverse kidney events 1 year after ECMO therapy, including baseline renal function, elevated creatinine levels, and KDIGO stage at the time of cannulation [34]. In this context, the RAI has emerged as a promising early risk stratification tool. Originally validated in the pediatric population, the RAI combines early clinical risk factors with early signs of kidney injury to predict the likelihood of developing severe AKI. Several studies have shown that an elevated RAI is independently associated with adverse outcomes [21,22]. In study by Sakaguchi et al., an elevated RAI was identified as an independent factor for severe AKI (OR 2.78; 95% CI, 2.19–3.53;p< 0.001) and mortality (HR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12–1.49;p< 0.001) in a cardiovascular intensive care unit [37]. Our study builds on prior evidence by demonstrating an association between RAI and RRT requirement in adult patients supported with VA-ECMO. This highlights the potential applicability of RAI beyond pediatric and non-ECMO populations. Given the multifactorial nature of AKI in ECMO, combining RAI with biochemical and hemodynamic markers may improve early risk stratification. However, its use in ECMO patients is still limited, and further prospective studies are needed to validate its role and clinical utility in this setting.

In a systematic review by Mitra et al., 72% of patients receiving VA-ECMO required RRT, with an associated mortality rate of 63% [38]. This results are similar to those at the meta-analysis of Thongprayoon et al. that found a higher risk of mortality in patients with AKI during ECMO-VA support, with mortality of 68.4% when associated with RRT [32]. Complementing these findings, Mou et al., reported a mortality rate of 60% (95% CI, 52.4–67.3%;p< 0.001) in VA-ECMO patients with AKI and 83% (95% CI, 77.2–88.8%;p< 0.001) in those with severe AKI. Among those requiring RRT, the relative risk of mortality was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.52–2.46;p< 0.001) [4]. In a separate meta-analysis, Mou et al. also identified several clinical risk factors associated with AKI in ECMO patients—including elevated serum creatinine, increased lactate levels, and prolonged mechanical ventilation—highlighting the multifactorial pathophysiology of renal injury in this critically ill population [39]. A summary of key studies reporting risk factors, incidence, and outcomes related to RRT in ECMO-supported patients is provided in Supplementary TableS2. This table consolidates data from major meta-analyses and observational studies, allowing a comparative view of existing evidence across different ECMO populations. It is worth mentioning that the incidence of RRT in our cohort is lower than that reported in previous meta-analyses. Several factors may account for this difference, including our center’s strict adherence to conservative RRT initiation protocols, the exclusion of patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease, and the early implementation of strategies to prevent fluid overload. In the study by Sharma et al., conducted in 1,124 patients (907 of whom were on mechanical ventilation), two RRT strategies—intensive vs. liberal—were compared. The average durations of mechanical ventilation were 2.07 days in the intensive RRT group and 3.08 days in the liberal RRT group. Furthermore, the intensive RRT group had a 67% (95% CI, 0.53–0.85;p< 0.001) risk of extubation failure [40]. The prolongation of mechanical ventilation has been linked to the degree of multiorgan dysfunction and exacerbation of pre-existing diseases [41]. Borasino et al. identified that ECMO-associated hemolysis, characterized by significantly higher median daily free plasma hemoglobin (FPH) (67.5 mg/dL;p= 0.025) and higher maximum FPH (120 mg/dL), was associated with an increased need for prolonged RRT and higher post-discharge mortality [42].

The ELSO guidelines recommend reaching an optimal “dry weight” [43]. In the study by Schmidt et al., they evaluated the impact of fluid balance in patients undergoing ECMO and found that a positive fluid balance of 1.3 L on the third day was an independent predictor of 90-day mortality and was associated with a higher requirement for RRT [44]. These findings are consistent with a broader meta-analysis by Messmer et al., that showed that fluid overload was significantly associated with increased mortality in critically ill adult patients, emphasizing the need for careful volume management in high-risk populations [45]. Additionally, fluid overload has been identified as an independent factor associated with mortality, worse oxygenation, prolonged intensive care unit stay and days on mechanical ventilation [43,46–48]. In contrast, Staudacher et al. identified that fluid volumes below the 50th percentile (< 8.5 L) in the first 24 h were associated with better prognosis after initiating VA-ECMO support in 195 patients [49]. Likewise, hyperkalemia is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and ICU readmission [50]. In a retrospective cohort of 9,681 patients in a cardiovascular ICU, hyperkalemia was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11–1.87;p= 0.006) and out-of-hospital mortality (aHR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08–1.34;p< 0.001), related to cardiotoxicity leading to arrhythmias and mortality [51].

In COVID-19, a DEOx > 3.75 mlO2/kg was associated with the need for intubation in patients with high-flow cannula, greater multiorgan dysfunction, severe gastrointestinal injury, and 28-day mortality [19,52]. Regarding APACHE II, renal injury is associated with a mortality rate of 25% in surgical cases and 36% in non-surgical cases [17]. In contrast, the SOFA score was found to be an independent factor associated with a mortality rate of 23% [16]. However, to date, no studies have linked these scores with the need for RRT in patients receiving ECMO support.

Our study has inherent limitations due to its retrospective design, which introduces the potential risk of selection bias and compromises data accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, we relied on a solid institutional information system, supported by standardized protocols for data collection, regular audits, and high adherence to trained medical staff within our research group. Although paraclinical data were gathered at various time points as part of routine monitoring and clinical events, for our analysis, we specifically selected data closest to the initial phase of clinical deterioration to ensure consistency and minimize temporal bias. Although our study identified risk factors associated with the need for RRT in patients receiving VA-ECMO support, the VV-ECMO population was excluded from the analysis, highlighting the need for further evaluations in this group. Furthermore, our cohort had a higher number of cardiovascular comorbidities, which could explain the higher mortality rate; however, our mortality rate was lower than that reported in the literature and in the ELSO registries. Finally, our findings underscore the need for future research to validate the factors associated with the requirement for RRT in patients receiving VA-ECMO support.

One significant limitation of this study is the relatively small number of patients in the RRT group (n= 27), which may have reduced the statistical power and limited the generalizability of our findings. To validate these associations across a broader ECMO population, future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted. Another noteworthy limitation relates to the predictive accuracy of conventional severity scores in identifying patients likely to require RRT. In our study, AUC values for SOFA, APACHE II, and DEOx remained below 0.75, suggesting limited clinical utility for renal-specific risk stratification in this context. While these scores capture general illness severity, they may lack the sensitivity and specificity required for predicting renal outcomes in ECMO patients. In contrast, the renal angina index (RAI) showed stronger discriminatory performance and may serve as a more targeted early warning tool for AKI. These findings support the need for further validation of renal-specific prediction models tailored to the ECMO population. Additionally, data on exposure to nephrotoxic agents (e.g., aminoglycosides, contrast media) and on individualized fluid management strategies were not available in our dataset. Finally, the observational design limits causal inference, and unmeasured confounders such as thyroid hormone supplementation, timing of RRT initiation, or nephrotoxic medication exposure may influence outcomes. These variables should be explored in future prospective studies.

In this cohort of VA-ECMO patients, the need for RRT was independently associated with hypothyroidism, elevated pre-ECMO creatinine, and a high Renal Angina Index. These factors may assist in early identification of patients at risk for AKI requiring RRT.
