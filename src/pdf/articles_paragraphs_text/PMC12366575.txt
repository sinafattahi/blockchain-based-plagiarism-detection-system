Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease requiring long-term therapy, where adherence critically impacts outcomes. Non-adherence remains a significant barrier to disease control, particularly in China, where healthcare disparities persist.

This scoping review aimed to systematically map the existing evidence on the frequency, barriers and facilitators of treatment adherence among Chinese patients with SLE and to identify gaps to guide future research and interventions.

We included studies that assessed adherence to pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological SLE treatments among Chinese adults (≥18 years). Eligible designs included observational, interventional, qualitative and mixed-method studies published in English or Chinese.

10 electronic databases (eg, CNKI, PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS) were searched from inception to 27 March 2024, using MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Additional studies were retrieved through manual reference screening.

Data were extracted using a standardised form informed by the WHO multidimensional adherence framework. Key variables included study design, adherence measurement tools, frequency and categorised barriers/facilitators. Data were charted independently by two reviewers.

21 studies met inclusion criteria. Adherence was most often measured via self-report, especially Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 and Compliance Questionnaire for Rheumatology. Non-adherence ranged from 33.3% to 75.0%, reflecting measurement and population heterogeneity. Barriers were commonly patient-related, treatment-related and system-related, including fear of side effects, complex regimens, poor communication and financial burden. Facilitators included structured education, psychological support, simplified regimens and family support.

Treatment adherence among Chinese SLE patients is suboptimal and influenced by multidimensional factors. Culturally tailored, multilevel interventions—addressing education, communication and system-level barriers—are urgently needed. Adoption of standardised adherence measures and use of the WHO framework can improve cross-study comparability and guide targeted interventions.

This scoping review was rigorously conducted following the Arksey and O’Malley framework and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Comprehensive and systematic searches were conducted across multiple Chinese and international databases, ensuring extensive literature coverage.

Study selection and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers, reducing the risk of selection bias.

This scoping review extensively stratified and presented data on the frequency, barriers and facilitators of treatment adherence among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in China, enhancing clarity and practical utility for clinical practice and future research.

Due to the heterogeneity and descriptive nature of included studies, quality appraisal and meta-analysis were not feasible, limiting the strength of evidence.

Only studies published in English or Chinese were included, potentially excluding relevant evidence published in other languages.

Given China’s substantial SLE patient population and its notable contribution to global SLE research, a comprehensive scoping review of treatment adherence among Chinese SLE patients is essential yet currently lacking. This study aims to systematically summarise evidence on the frequency of treatment adherence and identify key barriers and facilitators influencing adherence in China. Understanding these factors is critical for developing targeted interventions and policies to enhance patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency within the unique context of China’s healthcare system.

Systematically summarise current evidence regarding the frequency of treatment adherence among patients with SLE in China.

Identify and categorise barriers and facilitators influencing treatment adherence according to the WHO multidimensional adherence framework.

Highlight existing knowledge gaps and provide insights to inform healthcare practice and guide future research on interventions to improve adherence.

We clearly defined our research question: What is the current evidence regarding the frequency, barriers and facilitators of treatment adherence among adults with SLE in China? Given the substantial disease burden of SLE in China and the scarcity of comprehensive reviews, this question warranted exploration to identify knowledge gaps and inform healthcare practice and policy.

We systematically searched multiple electronic databases, including four Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and China Biomedical Database) and five international databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, OVID, Web of Science and SCOPUS), from inception to 27 March 2024. Key search terms included “systemic lupus erythematosus”, “Systemic lupus erythematosus”, “China,” “medication adherence”, “treatment adherence”, “medication intake”, “medication concordance”, “medication compliance” and “medication consistency”, focusing on titles and abstracts. We also looked through review articles and relevant meta-analyses to find further studies. Full details of the electronic search strategy used for PubMed are provided intable 1, and additional database strategies are available in the supplementary material (online supplemental appendix S1).

Population (P): individuals of all ages diagnosed with SLE in China, including both paediatric and adult patients.

Intervention/Concept (I): studies addressing adherence to SLE treatments (including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions or management approaches).

Comparison (C): clearly defined comparator groups (if applicable in interventional studies).

Outcome (O): reported frequency, barriers or facilitators related to treatment adherence.

Did not specifically address adherence to treatment.

Were case studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, letters, editorials, commentaries or conference abstracts without full-text availability.

Were published in languages other than English or Chinese.

Initially met inclusion criteria but were subsequently excluded due to full-text inaccessibility after multiple retrieval attempts.

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts against eligibility criteria. Subsequently, full-text screening was performed independently by the same reviewers, and disagreements were resolved through consensus or with input from a third reviewer. The selection process is summarised in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram (figure 1).

We developed a standardised data extraction form based on the WHO multidimensional adherence framework.10Data extracted included study characteristics (authorship, publication year, study design, population details), adherence measurement methods, reported adherence rates and identified barriers and facilitators (online supplemental appendix S2). Although we employed the WHO multidimensional adherence framework for systematically categorising and analysing barriers and facilitators, it is important to note that the primary studies included did not necessarily apply this WHO framework explicitly. Data charting was performed independently by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved through discussion or third-party arbitration. Extracted data were systematically organised and managed using Microsoft Excel, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

A narrative synthesis approach was applied to summarise the charted data. Key findings were structured according to the WHO multidimensional adherence framework, categorised into patient-related, therapy-related, condition-related, socioeconomic and healthcare system-related factors. Additionally, we explicitly synthesised studies that provided direct patient perspectives on adherence, highlighting distinct facilitators and barriers experienced by patients themselves.

This scoping review adheres strictly to the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews.11The review protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework (registration DOI:https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GQWA7).

A scoping review approach was chosen due to the exploratory nature of the topic and the considerable heterogeneity among existing studies, which rendered a rigorous quantitative synthesis unfeasible. While a systematic review incorporating quality assessment and statistical synthesis may offer stronger conclusions, the current variability in study design, outcome measures and adherence definitions makes such an approach premature. Stakeholder consultations were not conducted, and this limitation is explicitly addressed in the discussion section.

The initial search retrieved a total of 888 articles. After removing duplicates, 456 articles underwent title and abstract screening, resulting in 37 articles eligible for full-text review. Ultimately, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review (figure 1).

All included studies were conducted in China and published between 2005 and 2023. The majority were cross-sectional studies (n=16), supplemented by randomised controlled trials (n=3), qualitative (n=1) and mixed-method studies (n=1). The total sample size across the studies was 4897 participants, with individual study sample sizes ranging from 56 to 488. The participants’ average age ranged from 28.2 years to 43.3 years. Most studies included both inpatient and outpatient populations diagnosed with SLE.Online supplemental appendix S1, table S1summarises detailed information including study design, sample characteristics, adherence measurement methods and non-adherence rates (online supplemental appendix S1, table S1).

Six studies employed self-developed questionnaires designed by study authors without external validation. These tools typically consisted of 5–10 items assessing patients’ self-reported frequency of missed doses or treatment interruptions. Although adaptable to local contexts, they lack psychometric rigour and comparability. Additionally, four studies used general self-report methods (eg, face-to-face interviews or diaries), which are known to be susceptible to recall and social desirability bias. Importantly, none of the studies adopted the medication possession ratio (MPR) or pharmacy refill data as a primary adherence measure, despite MPR being widely accepted as an objective benchmark (with ≤80% indicating inadequate adherence).

In terms of pharmacological scope, all included studies assessed adherence to glucocorticoids. A subset also evaluated adherence to hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), biologics or traditional Chinese medicine. However, most studies did not stratify adherence data by drug class, instead presenting aggregate adherence outcomes. This heterogeneity in both drug types and assessment tools likely contributes to the observed variability in reported adherence rates. The distribution of drug classes assessed across studies is summarised in table 3.

The reported prevalence of medication non-adherence among Chinese SLE patients varied significantly, ranging from 33.3% to 75.0%. Specifically, studies employing the CQR or CCQR19 scales reported non-adherence rates from 42.0% to 71.8%.15,18Studies using MMAS-8 scales indicated non-adherence rates ranging from 41.1% to 75.0%.19,23Studies using self-developed questionnaires reported a non-adherence prevalence of between 33.3% and 60.5%,24,33indicating substantial variability dependent on the assessment methods used. Variability in adherence was observed due to differences in patient characteristics, geographic location, medications used and evaluation methods. To improve interpretability, adherence data were stratified by key demographic, clinical and methodological variables, as recommended. The stratifications are summarised intable 2.

Following the WHO framework, the challenges associated with medication non-adherence among Chinese SLE patients are classified as patient-related, healthcare system-related, socioeconomic, treatment-related and medical condition-related. Specific obstacles and contributing factors are summarised infigure 2.

Patient-related barriers commonly cited included forgetfulness in taking medications,15 16 22 26 29 30inadequate disease-related knowledge,20,2932 34 35lack of confidence in treatment effectiveness,22 32low self-efficacy in managing chronic illness34and unrealistic expectations of treatment outcomes.26Several studies further reported that cultural beliefs, such as preference for traditional remedies and mistrust of long-term Western medications, discouraged consistent medication use.17 24 25 29Forgetfulness and difficulty in maintaining consistent intake schedules were often cited as reasons for missed doses, particularly among patients with competing obligations such as work or caregiving responsibilities.16In this context, the use of medication reminder tools (eg, alarms, smartphone applications or pill boxes) was suggested as a potential intervention to improve adherence, especially for patients who expressed difficulties in remembering their treatment schedules.16 32In a study of 195 hospitalised patients with SLE, only 28.2% were considered adherent, and nearly half cited limited understanding of disease mechanisms and treatment rationale as a key barrier.17These findings suggest that individual-level perceptions and behaviours—including misconceptions about treatment goals—play a critical role in non-adherence and warrant targeted patient education and behavioural interventions.

Healthcare system-related barriers commonly cited were insufficient health education and follow-up visits,17inadequate communication with healthcare providers,2022 24,27 29dissatisfaction with treatment plans20 22 25 26 28and lack of trust in healthcare professionals.21A survey of 488 patients with SLE found that 65.7% believed they had a limited understanding of medication instructions. This suggests a communication gap between patients and providers, indicating a need for clearer treatment instructions. This association was further supported by findings from Xieet al, where patient dissatisfaction with treatment-related communication was independently associated with reduced adherence (OR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.93; p = 0.037),22underscoring the critical role of provider-patient interaction in adherence behaviour.

Socioeconomic-related barriers commonly reported in the included studies encompassed rural residence,21 22 30low educational attainment as a proxy for health or disease-specific literacy,1517 19,22 24 25 27unemployment or unstable occupational status,16 18 19 30low household income,17,1921 24 25 27 28 30 35limited family support20 21 23 25 27 30 32 34 35and marital status.18 20 25 27 34A study conducted in Sichuan, China, found that patients residing in rural areas were significantly more likely to exhibit poor adherence compared with urban counterparts (OR=2.90, 95% CI: 1.09 to 7.75, p=0.034), potentially due to the lack of nearby rheumatologic services and prolonged travel distances to tertiary treatment centres.22Similarly, lower adherence rates were more prevalent among patients with limited education, which may reflect lower levels of health or medication literacy, although no study directly assessed these constructs. Marital status also played a role, with several studies suggesting that being unmarried or divorced was associated with reduced adherence.18 20 27Employment status was typically assessed as employed versus unemployed or retired, and unemployment was associated with lower adherence rates.16 18A cost analysis by Zhanget alrevealed that patients with SLE incurred the highest annual direct medical costs among rheumatologic conditions (mean ¥33 899 ± ¥73 278), along with substantial indirect costs (mean ¥8993 ± ¥28 139), suggesting a significant financial burden that may compromise long-term treatment adherence.16Collectively, these findings underscore the complex interplay between social disadvantage, financial strain and reduced access to health services in shaping adherence behaviours.

Treatment-related barriers commonly reported in the included studies encompassed adverse effects of medications,1620,22 24complex or burdensome medication regimens,26 32drug types and dosages,21 32 34and in fewer instances, the timing of medication administration and logistical access to treatment centres or pharmacies.22Adverse drug reactions were consistently identified as a major disincentive to adherence, with one study reporting a significantly increased risk of non-adherence associated with side effects (OR=2.42, 95% CI: 1.11 to 5.28, p=0.027).22In that study, a substantial subset of patients discontinued medications due to feelings of discomfort, generalised malaise or fear of long-term complications such as weight gain, acne, menstrual irregularities or organ toxicity. Additionally, 23.8% of patients hesitated to adhere to prescribed treatments due to the high number and variety of medications, particularly in cases with multiorgan involvement typical of advanced SLE.26Although most studies did not detail specific pharmacological regimens, patient narratives suggested that high pill burden, rather than drug identity per se, served as a central deterrent. A few studies further noted that certain drug formulations (eg, injectable agents or those requiring strict timing) posed greater challenges for sustained use.21 32Timing-related difficulties were rarely the primary focus of included studies, but delays or inconsistent intake schedules were mentioned as complicating factors. Access to treatment centres or medication-dispensing locations was also noted as a contributing barrier in rural settings, where long travel times reduced medication continuity.22Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of regimen complexity, medication tolerability and logistical factors in shaping adherence behaviours. They also support the potential value of simplified, fixed-dose combination therapies—such as once-daily oral formulations combining hydroxychloroquine, low-dose corticosteroids and antihypertensives—as a strategy to mitigate pill burden and improve long-term adherence in patients with stable disease.

SLE-specific barriers to medication adherence frequently reported in the included studies involved frequent disease flares,16elevated disease activity levels15 21 32and SLE-related psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression.15 19 21 25 33 35Flare recurrence and active disease status were associated with reduced adherence, particularly in paediatric populations, where patients with unstable disease exhibited significantly poorer adherence compared with those in stable condition (p=0.016, p=0.005).32Disease activity was assessed using physician-reported clinical evaluations and/or disease activity indices, although some studies did not specify the measurement tool used. Psychological problems were included in this category only when explicitly linked to SLE, such as the study by Duet al, which found that depression (present in 32.9% of SLE patients) and anxiety were independently associated with nonadherence (OR=1.138, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.265; p=0.017) .15In paediatric patients, disease-related growth delays were also linked to lower adherence levels compared with peers without growth complications.32These findings suggest that biological disease course and its physical and emotional sequelae constitute a substantial barrier to sustained medication adherence in both adult and paediatric SLE populations.

Facilitators enhancing treatment adherence among Chinese SLE patients were comprehensively reported and systematically categorised using the WHO adherence framework.

Patient-related facilitators of treatment adherence in SLE included improved SLE-specific education and awareness,20,2224enhanced self-efficacy21 32 34and the use of structured medication reminder systems.16 22 32Increased knowledge about SLE pathogenesis, treatment mechanisms and long-term disease management was associated with greater adherence; for instance, Wanget alreported that patients who demonstrated higher awareness of SLE management strategies were significantly more likely to adhere to prescribed regimens (χ²=12.278, p<0.01).30Similarly, improvements in self-efficacy—defined as the patient’s confidence in their ability to manage a complex treatment schedule—were positively correlated with adherence behaviour (r=0.611, p<0.001).32Medication reminder tools—such as mobile phone alarms, calendar alerts and handwritten dosing schedules created by patients or caregivers—were reported to reduce forgetfulness and improve compliance.16 22A Shanghai-based study found that the use of such tools significantly increased adherence likelihood (OR=6.252, 95% CI: 2.530 to 15.444, p<0.01).16In addition, studies noted that patients who received more comprehensive medication information from healthcare providers were more likely to follow their prescribed regimens.18Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of targeted educational support and behavioural interventions—particularly those tailored to knowledge gaps and daily routine challenges—in promoting medication adherence in SLE.

Healthcare system-related facilitators of treatment adherence in SLE included effective patient-provider communication,1718 20 21 23,27 29personalised patient education17 21 34and structured follow-up care.1721,23 32Effective communication was defined in the included studies as patients’ perception that healthcare professionals explained treatment instructions clearly, responded to questions patiently and maintained respectful, empathetic interactions throughout the consultation process. Xieet alreported that higher patient satisfaction with provider communication was significantly associated with greater odds of adherence (OR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.93, p=0.037). Structured follow-up was operationalised as regularly scheduled review visits, standardised follow-up protocols and proactive tracking of patients’ medication adherence status. Patients who received such follow-up exhibited markedly higher adherence than those without (OR=3.95, 95% CI: 1.56 to 9.98, p=0.004).22Personalised patient education was defined as tailored instructional content adapted to the patient’s disease stage, education level and prior knowledge, often delivered through one-on-one counselling sessions or individualised written materials. For example, Zhou and Cheng observed improved adherence outcomes following structured, individualised education programmes delivered in outpatient rheumatology clinics.19Across these studies, adherence was assessed using validated scales (eg, CCQR, MMAS-8), and higher scores were considered reflective of objectively better adherence behaviour.

Socioeconomic-related facilitators commonly reported included strong family and social support networks,20 21 23 25 27 30 32 34 35marital status or cohabitation with a partner17 27and stable economic conditions, including adequate healthcare insurance coverage.17 18 21 25 27 28 30 34 35Family support encompassed practical assistance with medication management, emotional encouragement and timely reminders to take medications. Huanget alreported that patients receiving higher levels of family support had significantly better adherence compared with those without such support (OR=3.56, p=0.001).27Marital status and cohabitation emerged as distinct facilitators; married or cohabiting patients demonstrated improved adherence outcomes, presumably due to continuous oversight, emotional reinforcement and practical support from a spouse or partner. For example, Liuet alobserved significantly higher adherence among married compared with single patients (OR=0.456, 95% CI: 0.280 to 1.000, p=0.05).17Additionally, sufficient economic stability and healthcare coverage reduced financial barriers to adherence. Liet alfound that higher per capita household income significantly predicted better adherence (p<0.001).18These findings highlight the substantial role of stable social structures, familial relationships and economic self-sufficiency in facilitating treatment adherence among patients with SLE.

Treatment-related facilitators reported in the included studies primarily involved regimen simplification21 26 32 34and individualised dose adjustments.21 32 34Simplification was defined as strategies that reduced the complexity of medication schedules, including decreasing the number of daily doses, consolidating medications where possible or aligning dosing times with patients’ daily routines. For instance, in a paediatric cohort, transitioning from multiple daily immunosuppressant doses to once-daily administration was associated with improved adherence and reduced administration fatigue.32Similarly, easy-to-follow protocols—such as visual medication calendars and stepwise titration plans—were used to enhance patients’ understanding and consistency in following the regimen. Primary studies suggested that these simplifications reduced patient burden by lowering cognitive load and minimising dosing errors, especially in polypharmacy contexts.20Proactive treatment management was also identified as a key facilitator. This included physician-initiated dose modifications, anticipatory counselling about common side effects and pre-emptive switching to better-tolerated alternatives when needed. Xieet alreported that patients who experienced proactive management of medication-related side effects—such as adjusting corticosteroid dosage in response to early gastrointestinal discomfort—were significantly more likely to adhere to their regimens (OR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.93, p=0.037).22These findings underscore the importance of collaborative, individualised treatment planning in fostering sustainable adherence among patients with SLE.

SLE-specific facilitators of treatment adherence included effective symptom control under therapy,21 25 32psychological counselling interventions15 19 21 25 33and targeted mental health support addressing anxiety and depression.15Effective symptom control referred to patients’ satisfaction with observable improvements in their SLE manifestations (eg, reduction in joint pain, rash or fatigue) following treatment, as described in both clinician-reported outcomes and patient narratives.21 25In studies involving paediatric SLE populations, stable disease—defined as sustained remission or low disease activity for more than 6 months—was associated with improved medication adherence compared with those with active disease or flare-ups (p=0.005).32Psychological interventions included counselling and supportive education specifically tailored to comorbid mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, which are common among individuals living with SLE.19 33In a study by Duet al,15patients who received structured mental health support targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms reported improved adherence. The same study found that the severity of depressive symptoms, as measured using the Self-Rating Depression Scale, was independently associated with treatment non-adherence (OR=1.138, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.265, p=0.017). Although the causal pathway between anxiety reduction and improved adherence was not directly tested, the authors hypothesised that psychological symptom relief may enhance patients’ motivation to adhere by reducing emotional distress and increasing perceived treatment benefits.

NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

Our review identified considerable variation in treatment adherence rates among SLE patients globally, with previously reported adherence ranging from as low as 3% to as high as 76%.16Such divergence in adherence frequencies arises partly from differences in patient populations and assessment methods. For example, a Thai cohort found approximately 25–32% of SLE patients were non-adherent,37whereas one Western study using self-reported pharmacy data observed a mean adherence rate of about 90%.38However, even in high-resource settings, significant non-adherence persists—nearly two-thirds of SLE patients in a Swedish survey acknowledged some degree of non-compliance.38These discrepancies highlight the influence of methodology and context: adherence is often overestimated when relying on patients’ self-reports or refill records and can be markedly lower when verified with objective measures. For instance, studies that monitored hydroxychloroquine levels in blood (via high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] assays) uncovered substantially more non-adherence than patient questionnaires alone, underscoring weak correlation between drug levels and self-reported adherence.39In sum, suboptimal adherence is a global challenge with serious clinical implications, and standardised, objective adherence measurements are needed to avoid underestimation of non-adherence and to better compare outcomes across different settings.

Global research consistently demonstrates that SLE patients face multiple treatment adherence barriers, many paralleling those identified among patients in China. Forgetfulness is widely reported.40In a South Korean study, approximately 73% of hydroxychloroquine discontinuations were due to forgetting doses.41Medication-related adverse effects, such as weight gain or cosmetic changes from corticosteroids, further lead patients to intentionally reduce or discontinue treatment.40This is also reflected in patients in China.22Financial constraints also hinder adherence, notably in lower-resource settings within the Asia-Pacific region, where medication costs and limited specialist access limit hydroxychloroquine use.42Although China has better medical security compared with some resource areas, opportunities to access medical resources are still limited in rural areas, exacerbating the possibility of missing or intentionally skipping medication.16 22In contrast, psychological barriers are prominent in higher-income settings. For example, moderate-to-severe depression doubled non-adherence odds among Saudi patients. Negative medication beliefs and poor patient-physician relationships are additional universal issues.43Contextual factors uniquely affect adherence. In India, sociocultural pressures prompted women to conceal illness post marriage, leading to treatment discontinuation.44These international insights highlight that while the specific mix of barriers can differ by context, SLE patients around the world face many similar challenges impeding their adherence. Our findings among patients in China similarly highlighted knowledge gaps, limited healthcare resources and psychological distress as significant adherence barriers, reinforcing the necessity for targeted interventions across diverse contexts. Collectively, these findings illustrate critical challenges that consistently undermine medication adherence in SLE patients.

Despite these significant challenges, several facilitators were identified that can improve adherence among patients with SLE. Several enabling factors have been identified that help SLE patients adhere to their therapy, providing instructive contrasts and parallels to the Chinese context. A strong therapeutic alliance and good communication between patients and providers appears crucial. For instance, a Japanese study found that higher trust in the treating rheumatologist along with a greater sense of hope about one’s health was significantly associated with better treatment adherence.45Chinese studies have also confirmed this,32and family and social support are particularly influential in the Chinese context. Research shows that patients with supportive family environment or children have higher adherence, reflecting the increase in personal responsibility and practical help from relatives.20 27Similarly, patients who hold positive beliefs about medications and acknowledge the necessity of their treatment tend to have higher adherence. In a European survey, believing in the benefit of lupus medications and not perceiving them as purely harmful was protective against non-adherence.46These findings align with the notion that improving patients’ understanding and confidence in their treatment can facilitate adherence. Indeed, international experts emphasise targeted patient education and counselling as key facilitators: by correcting misconceptions about medications and raising health literacy, education can empower patients to follow their regimens more consistently.40Interventions such as dedicated adherence education programmes, regular physician feedback and shared decision-making have been recommended to bolster patients’ engagement with therapy. In a word, fostering trust, solving patients’ concerns through education and supporting positive medication beliefs are the adherence-promoting factors of general concern in various countries. This further confirmed that psychosocial support and clear communication were generally beneficial to improve the treatment adherence of SLE. Strengthening the social support system, strengthening the communication between patients and providers, and improving patient education and psychological coping mechanisms have become recognised strategies to improve medication adherence.

This review primarily included studies assessing treatment adherence, the identified influencing factors—such as patient education, healthcare communication, psychological well-being and social support—are broadly relevant to overall treatment adherence in SLE. Certain limitations of this review must be acknowledged. Due to its scoping review design and the substantial variability among included studies, we did not perform quality appraisal (eg, risk-of-bias or GRADE evaluation) or meta-analysis, limiting the strength and precision of our recommendations. Most studies included were cross-sectional, preventing conclusions regarding causal relationships. Additionally, studies employed diverse adherence measurement methods (eg, self-reported questionnaires and blood-level measurements), complicating direct comparisons. This review also primarily synthesised evidence from China, which restricts its generalisability to other healthcare systems and cultural contexts. Although we employed the WHO adherence framework to systematically categorise factors influencing treatment adherence, we acknowledge that the use of this predetermined model might have limited the exploration of emerging themes outside the predefined dimensions. Future research employing thematic synthesis could offer additional insights into previously unrecognised barriers or facilitators. Finally, given the absence of a universally accepted adherence-assessment framework in SLE, we recommend future research adopt the WHO multidimensional adherence model to ensure consistency, enhance comparability across studies and facilitate targeted adherence interventions globally.

Improving treatment adherence among patients with SLE in China and other low- and middle-income countries requires a comprehensive, multilevel strategy.47Enhancing patient education remains fundamental: targeted interventions that address knowledge gaps, correct misconceptions about medication and reduce fears related to drug side effects can empower patients to better manage their condition.48Many SLE patients bypass primary care clinics due to insufficient rheumatology expertise and diagnostic resources at the community level, leading to misdiagnoses, treatment delays and fragmented long-term care.49Enhancing capacity at the primary care level through specialised training, improved access to diagnostic tools and the establishment of referral pathways is essential to ensure continuity of care. Recent initiatives such as the ‘One City, One Centre’ programme aim to address the unequal distribution of specialist resources and expand access in underserved regions.50In parallel, adopting affordable digital health interventions—such as Short Message Service reminders, mobile health apps, telemedicine consultations and online follow-up systems—has been shown to enhance communication and adherence in resource-constrained settings.47Mobilising family and community-based support systems, including peer-support groups, community health workers and family caregivers, offers emotional reinforcement and practical assistance to help patients navigate psychological and logistical barriers.47 51At the policy level, improving insurance coverage and financial protection is vital. Despite near-universal insurance enrolment in Mainland China, disparities in reimbursement rates and high copayments for specialist care persist, particularly in rural schemes.8 52In contrast, regions such as Hong Kong and Macao provide comprehensive public healthcare at minimal or no cost, while Taiwan’s National Health Insurance system classifies SLE as a catastrophic illness, exempting patients from out-of-pocket payments for covered treatments.52 53Finally, integrating adherence as a quality indicator in chronic disease management programmes could incentivise providers to improve long-term follow-up. Adaptation of effective strategies from high-income settings—such as multidisciplinary team-based care, shared decision-making and structured psychological support—should be tailored to local contexts. In areas with limited specialist availability, training general practitioners and nurses in rheumatology care and psychological counselling, supported by remote specialist consultations, can approximate the benefits of multidisciplinary management.51Systematic screening and treatment of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety is also necessary, given their consistently negative impact on adherence.54Integrating patient education, digital health, community support and tiered care offers a feasible roadmap to enhance SLE adherence in resource-constrained settings.

This scoping review synthesised evidence on treatment adherence in Chinese patients with SLE, revealing wide variation in non-adherence rates, largely attributable to inconsistent measurement methods and lack of stratification by treatment type. Key barriers identified included medication-related adverse effects, inadequate disease understanding and psychological comorbidities. Conversely, facilitators encompassed structured patient education, effective communication and strong family and social support. These findings underscore the multifactorial and context-sensitive nature of adherence behaviour in SLE. Future research should prioritise the development of validated, standardised adherence measurement tools specific to SLE and assess multicomponent, culturally tailored interventions—including digital platforms, mental health integration and tiered care reinforcement—within both community and tertiary care settings. Adoption of the WHO multidimensional adherence framework may further enhance comparability across studies and support the design of sustainable, evidence-informed adherence strategies globally.
