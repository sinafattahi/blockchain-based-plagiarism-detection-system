N6-Adenosine methylation
is the most
abundant modification of mRNA. The three members of the YTH domain
family proteins (YTHDF1–3) recognize in the cytoplasm the m6A-RNA modification. We screened a library of about 500,000
fragments (i.e., molecules with 11–20 non-hydrogen atoms) by
docking into YTHDF2, which resulted in the identification of six active
compounds among 47 tested in vitro (hit rate of 13%). The acquisition
of 28 analogues of the docking hits provided an additional set of
10 active compounds (IC50< 100 μM). Protein crystallography-guided
optimization of a ligand-efficient fragment by the synthesis of 32
derivatives culminated in a series of YTHDF2 ligands, which show low-micromolar
affinity measured by a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay and a
homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based (HTRF) assay. The series
is characterized by very favorable ligand efficiency (of about 0.3–0.4
kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom). Compound23binds to
YTHDF2 according to the FP and HTRF assays with aKdvalue of 1.3 μM and an IC50value of
11 μM, respectively, and it is selective against all of the
other YTH reader proteins. Several compounds of the series bind to
the three YTHDF proteins with similar low-micromolar affinity, while
they are less potent for YTHDC1 and YTHDC2. In contrast, compounds17and30bind also to YTHDC2, withKdof 6.3 and 4.9 μM, respectively. We also disclose
six crystal structures of YTHDF2 in the complex with the fragments
identified by docking.

The
YTH (YT521-B homology) domain-containing proteins are a family
of RNA-binding proteins that specifically recognizeN6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant
internal modification in eukaryotic RNA. These proteins play critical roles in various biological processes,
including mRNA metabolism, splicing, stability, and translation, influencing
gene expression and cellular functions.−The YTH family consists
of five members: YTHDF1 (from now on termed DF1), YTHDF2 (DF2), YTHDF3
(DF3), YTHDC1 (DC1), and YTHDC2 (DC2). DC1 is primarily nuclear, where it participates in mRNA splicing,
processing, and export. In contrast, the
DF proteins (DF1, DF2, and DF3) are mainly cytoplasmic and play essential
roles in mRNA translation, stability, and degradation. Finally, DC2 is the latest discovered member of this protein
family and is mostly cytoplasmic, even though it has been found to
interact with nuclear components, suggesting a dual role in RNA processing
and regulation.,Its functions appear to overlap
with those of DF proteins, particularly in regulating RNA translation
and stability. While other family members are broadly expressed across
various cell types, DC2 is notably enriched in the testes, where it
plays a critical role in germ cell development and maturation.

Given their crucial role
in gene expression regulation, it is not
surprising that YTH proteins and m6A regulation are heavily
implicated in various diseases, especially cancer. Our study focuses
on DF2, which is involved in multiple types of cancer, including prostate
cancer, MYC-driven breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This makes DF2 a highly attractive target for
drug discovery and is gaining more and more attention. Even though
we focus mainly on DF2, the highly conserved m6A binding
site of the DF proteins hinders the development of a DF2-selective
ligand. Furthermore, the discussed compensatory
effects make a pan-DF ligand desirable.

Only a few small-molecule
ligands have been identified for the
DF protein family. Among them are Ebselen, Tegaserod, and Salvianolic Acid C, previously known compounds repurposed from other
targets. Reviews of known inhibitors of the YTH proteins can be found
in refs  and . In our earlier publication, we reported the first small-molecule binders
of DF2; the X-ray crystal structure of one of them (compound11, IC50= 174 μM) is the starting point of this work. Subsequently, Wang et al. reported
the discovery of DC-Y13–27, a DF2 inhibitor with an IC50of 21.8 μM (measured using an AlphaScreen assay) and
aKdof 38 μM (determined by microscale
thermophoresis). The compound showed
weaker activity on DF1 (IC50= 165 μM in the AlphaScreen
assay), but was not tested on DF3. A
more recent study identified a series of functionalized pyrazoles
as selective DF2 binders. The most potent
compound, CK-75, exhibited an IC50of 13.2 μM in
an AlphaScreen assay and was found to be inactive against all other
members of the YTH protein family. Notably, CK-75 induced cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis in the K567 leukemia cell line, further supporting
DF2 as a promising therapeutic target.

Here we present a new series of DF2 binders identified by
docking,
followed by structure–activity relationship (SAR)-by-catalog.
We discovered new chemotypes that compete with m6A-RNA
for binding to DF2. Medicinal chemistry optimization of a ligand-efficient
scaffold resulted in a series of low-micromolar binders of DF2. Most
compounds of the series show a preference for DF proteins against
DC1 and DC2. Compound23binds only to DF2, being selective
against all of the other YTH proteins.

The chemical diversity
represented by a library ofNfragments (with up
to 18–20 non-hydrogen atoms) is substantially larger than the
diversity of a library ofNmolecules with more than
25–30 heavy atoms. As a consequence,
fragment screening by docking is an efficient alternative to the screening
of ultralarge libraries of compounds. Thus, we decided to start with a fragment docking campaign in DF2.
A library of 500,000 fragments was docked using the program SEED.,The fragments were selected from the ZINC20 database according to the following rules: between 11
and 20 heavy atoms, at least one ring, and at least one sp3-hybridized carbon. The first two rules reflect the properties of
the program SEED, which was developed for docking mainly rigid fragments.
The third rule was selected as our first campaign had identified ligand
fragments with methyl, ethyl, or cyclopropyl in the bottom of the
aromatic pocket. For each of the extracted
compounds, up to 20 conformers were generated using a distance geometry-based
algorithm, and docked by SEED. Two structures
of the m6A-RNA recognition domain of DF2 were used for
docking (Figure).
The crystal structure in the complex with 6-cyclopropylpyrimidine-2,4-diol
(compound11in ref  PDB ID:7R5W) and a snapshot obtained by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations started from the same crystal structure.
The MD snapshot was selected by analysis of the time series of the
volume of the recognition pocket. It has a more open recognition loop with a pocket volume of 600 Å3, which is significantly larger than the volume of 324 Å3in the crystal structure7R5W(Figure).

of the m6A-recognition pocket (seeMaterials
and Methods). The surface of DF2 is colored by the electrostatic
potential (red, negative; blue, positive), and 6-cyclopropylpyrimidine-2,4-diol
(carbon atoms in green) and the binding site residues are shown by
sticks (carbon atoms in yellow).

The two protein structures were kept rigid during
docking and evaluation
of the binding energy. SEED calculates the binding energy by a force
field with implicit treatment of the electrostatic effects of the
solvent. The docked compounds were ranked according to two energy
terms, namely, the total binding energy and the difference between
the electrostatic contribution to the intermolecular interaction energy
in the solvent and the solvation energy of the ligand. The top-scoring
compounds were then selected if they showed the crucial hydrogen bond
with the backbone carbonyl of C433, which is the acceptor of theN6of the natural ligand m6A, and
another polar interaction within the binding site (seeMaterials and Methods). If an interesting compound was not
commercially available, then a structurally similar analogue was chosen.
Finally, 25 and 22 compounds were selected from the docking campaigns
that made use of the crystal structure and MD snapshot, respectively
(Table S1).

A previously reported homogeneous
time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based assay was used to measure
the binding affinity of the 47 ordered compounds (seeMaterials and Methods). For the
nine compounds with residual signal at 1 mM smaller than 60% (with
respect to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control), the IC50value was determined by dose–response experiments (Table S1). Among these, the thiobarbiturate derivatives1and2were the strongest binders of DF2, with
IC50values of 19 and 170 μM, respectively (Table). The thiobarbiturate
derivative1shows a very favorable ligand efficiency
(LE) of 0.50 kcal/(mol HAC) [HAC = heavy atoms count, i.e., number
of non-hydrogen atoms] while the toluene group of compound2does not seem to contribute to binding.

The NH group interacting as a hydrogen-bond
donor with the backbone carbonyl of C433 (blue) and the group in the
bottom of the tryptophan cage (red) are emphasized for the compounds
with a crystal structure in the complex with DF2.

The residual signal at 1 mM compound
concentration is measured using an HTRF-based binding assay as previously
reported. The signal decreases (with
respect to buffer-only measurement) when the fragment competes with
the binding of the natural ligand, i.e., m6A-oligoRNA.
Thus, the lower the signal, the higher the affinity of the fragment.
The reported values are the average of two technical replicates.

We use the term IC50for
the concentration of the compound that reduces the signal by 50% with
respect to buffer-only. YTH readers are not enzymes, but we still
prefer the more frequently used inhibitory concentration (IC50) rather than effective concentration. The IC50value
for the DF2 reader domain was measured only for the fragments that,
at a concentration of 1 mM, decrease the signal by more than 60%.

The ligand efficiency is calculated
asLE=−ΔGHAC≈−RTln⁡IC50HACand the values are reported in kcal/(mol
HAC), HAC = heavy atom count.

Compounds1–6were identified by
docking, while compounds7–16were
selected by SAR by catalogue. * Interference
or poor solubility observed at 1 mM.#Interference or
poor solubility observed at higher concentrations, IC50could not be determined.

The X-ray crystal structure was solved for compounds3–6at high resolution (TableandFigureB–E). The unique binding mode of compound3provided evidence that the ene-thiobarbiturate substructure
of compounds1–3specifically and
noncovalently binds to DF2 despite the potential Michael acceptor
reactivity.

(red sphere) and the hydrogen bonds (yellow dashed lines) are also
shown. (H) Structural overlap of panels (A)–(G). The carbon
atoms of the ligands are colored green and those of the protein in

From the information gained in the
first screening, a second set of 28 compounds was ordered (Table S2). This set consisted of 14 top-ranking
docked molecules with a chemotype similar to that of compounds1–3, and other 14 molecules that are closely related
to the discovered binders1–6but
were not present in the library used for docking. A total of 16 of
the ordered compounds belong to the thiobarbiturate chemotype, which
was considered very promising from the previous results. Ten of the
28 compounds (ligands7–16) showed an IC50< 100 μM.

Among the thiobarbiturate derivatives7–10, ligand8is the most potent (IC50= 6 μM and LE = 0.36). The carboxylic acid substituent
is likely to contribute to the binding affinity, as the solvent-exposed
portion of the DF2 binding pocket is rich in positively charged residues
(K416, K490, and R527;FigureH), which typically interact with the negatively charged phosphates
of RNA, its natural substrate.

Other molecules closely related
to the thiobarbiturates were identified
as interesting binders: barbiturates11and12, triazine13, and condensed bicycles14–16. The X-ray crystal structures of compounds13and15confirm their binding (FigureF,G), again showing the sulfur
atom interacting within the lipophilic tryptophan cage.

Compound15can establish all of the interactions
previously discussed: in addition to the interactions of m6-adenine, it can interact with both D422 and D528. (Note though that
m6-adenine is likely to be protonated in the bound state
as suggested by the distance of 2.6 Å between its N1 atom and
the nearest O atom of the D422 side chain (PDB entry7YWB).) Unfortunately,
the multiple interactions of compound15do not translate
into a very strong binding (IC50= 86 μM). This might
be a consequence of the major tautomer represented inTablebeing in equilibrium with other
tautomeric forms, which are not ideal for efficient binding (∼67%
of the desired tautomer, as calculated with the Chemaxon tautomers
generator pluginhttps://plugins.calculators.cxn.io/tautomers/). Compounds13and14are characterized
by very favorable LE values of 0.73 and 0.60, respectively. We decided
to further explore the derivatization of compound14because
of its favorable LE, the two possible vectors for substitution at
the two carbon atoms of its thiophene ring, respectively, and the
relatively accessible synthesis (see below). We could not determine
the crystal structure of DF2 in complex with14. The
choice of compound14was supported by its pose predicted
by docking, which overlapped with the binding mode of compound15in the high-resolution crystal structure with DF2 (PDB
entry9QFL).

The exploration
of analogues of14has been pursued by synthesizing new
derivatives (TablesandS4) and ordering commercially available
variants (Table S3). The replacement of
the exocyclic sulfur atom with oxygen was detrimental to the potency,
from 18 to 290 μM (compoundS61). Several 5- and
6-membered ring alternatives to the thiophene were explored (compounds15,16,S5,S62–S64), and only compound16resulted in an IC50comparable to that of fragment14(30 vs 18 μM).

For compounds with
a single value,
it refers to DF2. The dose–response curves and replicates are
shown in theFigure S1.

TheKdvalues
were determined with the Cheng–Prusoff equation using
aKdvalue of 5 nM (DF2), 7 nM (DC2),
and 5 nM (DC1) for the 5′-fluorescein-labeled m6A-DNA probe. The reported values are the averages of one (DC1) or
two (DF2 and DC2) biological replicates, and each replicate is the
average of four technical replicates. The dose–response curves
are inFigures S2(DF2),S3(DC2), andS4(DC1).

Compounds17–31are more active for DF2 than compound14in
the HTRF and/or the FP assays.

The medicinal chemistry campaign focused on derivatizing
the thiophene
ring of14through the addition of R1and/or
R2groups (TableandTable S4). A total of 32 molecules
were synthesized (Table S4).Tableshows the molecules with higher
affinity than compound14as measured by the HTRF-based
binding assay and/or FP. As mentioned above, we were not able to determine
the crystal structure of14in complex with DF2. Thus
we hypothesized a similar binding mode as in the crystal structure
with compound15(FigureA). The putative binding poses will be further analyzed
and discussed in the next section.

CompoundS74(R2= phenyl)
and its derivatives
(17–19,S75, andS76) were synthesized to try to obtain a favorable π–π
stacking interaction with Y418, as seen in the X-ray crystal structure
of theN-methyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo­[4,3-d]­pyrimidin-7-amine (compound7in ref , PDB:7YXE). Among these compounds,17and18resulted in a 3-fold improved IC50in the HTRF-based binding assay (Table), possibly due to a hydrogen bond between
the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl of Y418 or the −NH2of N462. At R1, we started with small polar substituents
to try to establish interactions with D528 and/or with the structural
water molecule or to try to replace the water molecule (compounds20,21,S79, andS80). The ethyl ester of21at R1enhanced the
binding (IC50= 6.3 μM), as also the bulkier benzyl
(22, IC50= 10 μM) and methylpyridine
(23, IC50= 11 μM) groups, both connected
to the thiophene via an amide bond. We hypothesized that the −CH2– linker enables the aromatic ring to orient toward
the solvent-exposed region of the pocket, which is enriched with positively
charged residues that facilitate binding to the negatively charged
RNA. Based on this, we explored modifications such as adding a carboxylic
acid (24) and further increasing the flexibility by replacing
the benzyl group with an alkyl chain (25andS83). However, none of these changes led to an improvement in the potency.

We continued the exploration of R1with substituted
benzyl and phenyl rings directly connected to the thiophene (compounds26–30andS84–S87). Compounds26and27resulted
in an improvement of 3- to 4-fold compared to fragment14.

An FP competition assay was used to further validate the
binding
of the compounds to DF2. The main difference with respect to a previously
published FP assay is the use of an oligo-DNA
as competitor ligand (seeMaterials and Methodssection). For most compounds, there is a factor of 2–5 difference
between the IC50values for DF2 measured by HTRF and FP
(Table). The largest
discrepancy is a factor of 16 for compound19(32 and
2 μM by HTRF and FP, respectively; note thatTableshows theKdvalue for FP, which is equal to the IC50/1.6
for DF2). These differences might originate from the varying conditions
in the two assays, such as the competitor mRNA (5′-biotin-AAGAACCGG­(m6A)­CUAAGCU-3′)
in HTRF and DNA (5′-FAM-AAGAACCGG­(m6A)­CTAAGCT-3′) in
FP, the salt concentration (150 mM NaCl and 100 mM KF in HTRF, and
150 mM NaCl in FP), and the pH (7.5 in HTRF and 7.4 in FP). The FP-based
assay was also employed to assess the selectivity against DC1 and
DC2 (seeSelectivitysection).

We could not determine the crystal
structure of the complex of DF2 with compound14or any
of its derivatives by soaking the ligands into apo DF2 crystals or
cocrystallization. Thus, we decided to run MD simulations to investigate
the binding mode of14and its derivatives17,23, and27(Figure). As already observed during the docking
campaign, the symmetry of the thiourea substructure is congruent with
two distinct poses (A and B), which are flipped by a rotation of 180°
around the SC double bond. For each compound and pose, eight
independent 0.2-μs MD simulations were performed for a cumulative
sampling of 3.2 μs per compound, starting from the docked poses
of compound14, or the alignment of the derivatives17,23, and27to it.

The
analysis of the MD trajectories was carried out by adapting the protocol
described in ref  (seeMaterials and Methods). Only the second
half of each MD run, i.e., the trajectory segments from 100 to 200
ns, was used for the analysis to allow for sufficient ligand relaxation.
From these segments, we extracted the simulation frames where the
compound is bound, defined as having a distance lower than 5 Å
between the exocyclic sulfur atom and the N atom of C433. Then we
calculated a set of 10 distances between the heavy atoms of the compounds
(all located in the scaffold, i.e., present in compound14) and the binding pocket. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA)
was used to project the multidimensional space into two dimensions.
The two-dimensional data were then clustered using the Gaussian Mixture
algorithm. The trajectory frame closest to the center of each cluster
(centroid) was extracted and used as the reference pose (FigureF).

FigureA shows
the two reference poses obtained for compound14compared
to the crystal structure of compound15. In both poses,
the exocyclic sulfur atom is positioned within the lipophilic tryptophan
cage. As mentioned above, compound14can adopt two distinct
orientations, which are related by a 180-degree rotation. This flipping
rearranges the hydrogen-bond interactions while preserving the same
number of favorable polar contacts. In both poses, the two NH groups
of the thiourea act as hydrogen-bond donors for the backbone carbonyl
of C433 and the side chain of D422, respectively. Moreover, the carbonyl
group and the thiophene sulfur atom are inverted between the two poses.
In pose A, the carbonyl oxygen interacts with the backbone NH of Y418,
as observed for the crystal structure with compound15(FiguresG and A top). In pose B, it instead forms a hydrogen bond
with the conserved water molecule (FigureA, bottom). The sulfur atom in the thiophene
ring points toward the structural water in pose A and the backbone
NH of Y418 in pose B. In both poses, it acts as a weak hydrogen-bond
acceptor.−The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis of
the MD runs started from the two poses suggests that pose A is slightly
more stable (FigureE, top).

A similar analysis was performed for compounds17,23, and27to investigate the
impact of bulky
R1and/or R2substituents on the stability of
the two poses. For compound17, a smaller RMSD is observed
for the B pose in comparison to A, and the opposite was observed for
compound23(FigureE). A smaller difference emerges for compound27, with pose A being slightly more stable.

We also
calculated the population of each cluster (FigureF). As expected, the most populated
cluster corresponds to the most stable pose based on RMSD analysis.
Specifically, 55% of the bound frames of compound14belong
to the cluster of pose A (FigureA, top); 61% of the bound frames of compound17to pose B (FigureB); 56% of compound23to pose A (FigureC); and 53% of compound27to pose A (FigureD).

The HTRF-based assay
was employed to evaluate
the selectivity of the series against other DF proteins. The compounds
were tested at a concentration of 100 μM and most of them also
inhibit DF1 and DF3 (Table S5).

A
dose–response experiment on DF1 and DF3 was conducted for compounds17,18,23, and27(Figure S5). Compounds17,18, and27are active on three DF proteins. Their
IC50values for DF1 are approximately twice as high as
those for DF2, while for DF3, they are 4–12 times higher. In
contrast, compound23is selective for DF2, with residual
signals (at the highest employed concentration of 62.5 μM) of
51 and 87% for DF1 and DF3, respectively.

The binding affinity
for DC1 could not be evaluated by HTRF because
of interference of the compounds with the assay, which has a smaller
assay window when performed with DC1 compared to the DF proteins.
Thus, the FP assay was used to evaluate binding to DC1 and DC2. The
affinity of the compounds for DC2 varied significantly depending on
the substituents, withKdvalues ranging
from 5 μM for compound30to over 400 μM
for compounds23,S74,S78,S79,S82,S83, andS89(TablesandS4).

The parent scaffold, compound14, exhibits approximately
a 20-fold and 8-fold higher binding affinity for DF2 compared to DC2
and DC1, withKdvalues of 3.8, 88, and
32 μM, respectively, as measured by FP (Table). Many derivatives maintain a strong preference
for DF2. Notably, compound23shows high selectivity,
being about 350 and 100 times more potent for DF2 than DC2 and DC1,
respectively. MD simulations of compound23in complex
with DC1 were performed following the same strategy described for
DF2 (see theComputational Analysissection).
The RMSD analysis (Figure S7) indicates
a higher stability (lower RMSD) of both poses A and B in DF2 compared
to DC1. These results are consistent with the selectivity of compound23for DF2 and against DC1.

In contrast, compounds with
a substituted phenyl ring directly
connected to the thiophene (R1or R2) exhibited
little to no selectivity against the DC proteins (e.g., ratioKdDC1/DF2 and DC2/DF2 of only 2–4 for
ligands29and30).

Compounds17,18, and28–30are the most potent DC binders of the series.
They feature benzoic acid (at R2in compound18and R1in compound30), benzoic ester (at
R2in compound17and R1in compound29), or para-methoxyphenyl (at R1in compound28). Their similar behavior indicates that the previously
discussed two poses (A and B, see previous section) may also be populated
in the DC1 and DC2 binding sites. These results suggest that the substituent,
at either R1or R2, likely occupies the same
region of the binding pocket. To the best of our knowledge, the only
previously identified DC2-binder in the literature is the pan-YTH
binder “N-7”, with a reported IC50of 30
μM (as measured by FP). Thus, compounds17and30are the most potent DC2 ligands as
of today (Kdvalues of 6.3 and 4.9 μM,
respectively, measured by FP).

We employed a fragment-based approach for
identifying ligand-efficient
small molecules that occupy the m6A-RNA recognition pocket
of the DF2 reader domain. A crystal structure of a previously disclosed
ligand-efficient fragment binder of DF2 (PDB7R5W) and a molecular dynamics snapshot were used for fragment
docking. Each of the two docking campaigns yielded three active compounds
and, thus, an overall hit rate of 13% (6/47). SAR by catalogue and
the synthesis of 32 derivatives of the thioxo-dihydrothienopyridinone
scaffold14resulted in a series of ligand-efficient,
low-micromolar binders of DF2. Most members of the series are selective
against DC1 and DC2, while they bind with low-micromolar affinity
also to DF1 and DF3. In contrast, compound23displays
distinct selectivity as it binds exclusively to DF2 (Kd= 1.3 μM and IC50= 11 μM measured
by FP and HTRF, respectively). Using a similar fragment-based strategy,
in our previous screening campaign for DF2 we identified 6-cyclopropyluracil
as hit compound with an IC50value of 170 μM. Compound23is more potent for
DF2 than 6-cyclopropyluracil by a factor of 15, and is significantly
more selective against DF1 and DF3. It is important to note that protein
crystallography played a key role in both screening campaigns, as
crystal structures were used for docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
Moreover, in the present campaign the crystal structure of DF2 in
the complex with compound15guided the derivatization
of compound14, which has a similar scaffold and binding
mode.

A few compounds (e.g.,17and18) have
a comparable affinity for the five YTH-containing proteins. Among
them, compounds17and30are currently
the most potent ligands of DC2 (Kdvalues
of 6.3 and 4.9 μM, respectively, measured by FP). We have also
presented the crystal structures of DF2 in complex with six ligands,
which represent six distinct chemotypes (compounds3–6,13, and15). This structural
data is useful for the development of a new series of ligands of the
YTHDF m6A-RNA readers, and for the further training of
machine learning models.

We
used force field-based
docking to identify small-molecule binders of the m6A reader
YTHDF2. The structure of the YTHDF2 domain used for docking is the
one in the complex with the ligand 6-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (PDB code:7R5W). We prepared
the protein structure for docking using CAMPARIv5. The SEED,,docking program was used for rigid docking to the crystal structure
itself and a snapshot obtained by MD simulations. These MD simulations
were described in a previous study. After
clustering the snapshots, a representative pose with a large aperture
of the m6A binding site was selected (volume of 600 vs
324 Å3in the crystal structure). The pocket volume
was obtained by structural alignment of the crystal structure (PDB7R5W) and the MD snapshot,
and using the dpocket functionality of the fpocket tool with the ligand
as reference. A library of 500,000 small
molecules was considered for screening by SEED. The molecules were
selected from the ZINC2020 database with
the number of non-hydrogen atoms between 11 and 20, at least one ring
and one sp3carbon in the structure. For each of the extracted
compounds, up to 20 conformers were generated using a distance geometry-based
algorithm.

The two protein structures
were kept rigid during docking and evaluation of the binding energy.
The residue C433 was selected for posing the fragments by SEED, which
is similar to a pharmacophoric constraint. For the evaluation of the
SEED energy, the binding site consisted of all of the DF2 residues
within 20 Å of C433 and all charged side chains of DF2. A structural
water molecule was also considered as part of the binding site because
it is consistently resolved in all of the crystal structures obtained
and is involved as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor with the side
chains of W432 and D528, respectively.,The partial
charges and van der Waals parameters for the atoms in the protein
and the small molecules were taken from the CHARMM36 all-atom force
field−and the CHARMM general force field (CGenFF), respectively. Importantly, the CHARMM36 force
field and CGenFF are fully consistent in their partial charges and
van der Waals parameters. The evaluation of the binding energy in
the program SEED consists of a force field-based energy function with
a continuum dielectric approximation of desolvation penalties by the
generalized Born model. The values of
the dielectric constant were 2.0 and 78.5 for the regions of the space
occupied by the solute and solvent, respectively. Fragment screening
by SEED requires about 1 s per fragment. SEED is available as an open-source
code from GitLab (https://gitlab.com/CaflischLab).

From both docking campaigns, the compounds were ranked according
to two energy terms calculated by SEED, namely, the total binding
energy (SEED total) and the difference between the electrostatic contribution
to the intermolecular interaction energy in the solvent and the solvation
energy of the ligand (Delec). The top-scoring compounds were then
selected if they showed the crucial hydrogen bond with the backbone
carbonyl of C433 and a favorable interaction with the backbone NH
of Y418, the side chain of D422, and/or the conserved water molecule.
Finally, 47 compounds were purchased on the basis of commercial availability
and structural diversity: 25 selected from the docking performed on
the crystal structure and 22 from that on the MD snapshot with a large
aperture of the binding site.

GST-YTHDC1,
GST-YTHDF1, GST-YTHDF2, and
GST-YTHDF3 were purified as previously reported. The HTRF assay was assembled as detailed in ref  with the only difference
being that the starting concentration of the dose–response
experiments used for the IC50determination was variated
dependently from the tested compound. The same protocol was applied
to the four proteins. The competitive inhibition data of GST-YTHDF1
(single dose experiment at 100 μM compound concentration and
dose–response curves), GST-YTHDF3 (single dose experiment at
100 μM compound concentration and dose–response curves),
and GST-YTHDF2 (single dose experiment at 100 μM compound concentration)
were normalized as described in ref  to mitigate interference. The signal was measured
as described in ref .

The N-terminally GST-tagged YTH
domain of YTHDC2 (residues 1285–1424, cloned into the pGEX-6P-1
vector) was overexpressed in Rosetta (DE3) cells grown overnight at
20 °C following induction with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an OD600of 0.8. The
cells were harvested and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mM NaCl. After cell lysis,
the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 48,000gfor 1 h, and the soluble proteins were loaded onto a column packed
with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), then eluted with 20
mM reduced glutathione in lysis buffer. Finally, a size-exclusion
chromatography step (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column, GE Healthcare)
was performed to further purify the protein in 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl.

For fluorescence
polarization (FP) experiments, a 5′-fluorescein-labeled m6A-DNA probe (5′-FAM-AAGAACCGG­(m6A)­CTAAGCT-3′)
was synthesized by Microsynth AG.

The final concentration of
the fluorescein-labeled DNA was kept constant at 3 nM. For YTHDC2
measurements, the protein concentration was set to 25 nM, while for
YTHDF2 measurements, it was set to 10 nM, and for YTHDC1, it was set
at 15 nM. The compound concentration was serially diluted to obtain
the dose–response curve. The competition experiments were conducted
in a final volume of 20 μL in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), using
a 384-well black flat-bottomed microplate (Corning 3575).

The YTH
domain of YTHDF2 was expressed, purified, crystallized, and soaked
as described in ref . The X-ray diffraction experiment was performed on the X06DA beamline
of Paul Scherrer Institute’s Swiss Light Source. The resulting
data were analyzed as described in ref .

We used
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the interactions between
the YTHDF2 domain and compounds14,17,23, and27. Compound14(and its
derivatives17,23and27)
can, in principle, bind in two poses due to the symmetry of its thiourea
ring. This was also observed in the docking results of compound14. Therefore, we defined two poses, A and B, depending respectively
on the orientation of the exocyclic sulfur atom pointing toward the
tryptophan cage or outward. We used the ParaLig software to modify the two docked poses of compound14to obtain derivatives17and27. The protein/ligand structures were then prepared using the software
CAMPARIv5. Simulations were run using
TIP3P (CHARMM) water model, with a 0.15
M concentration of Na+and Cl–ions.
We equilibrated the systems first using an NPT ensemble to reach 300
K and 1 bar under 10 kJ/(mol Å2) positional restraints.
We then applied four successive 1 ns NVT equilibrations with weakening
restraints of 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 kJ/(mol Å2), respectively.
All simulations were done using the CHARMM36m force field with the July 2022 GROMACS port. Production
MD simulations consisted of eight independent runs for each compound
and pose and a sampling of 200 ns per run. Production simulations
were performed at the Swiss Supercomputing Center (CSCS) with the
support of grant s1272 using GROMACS 2021.5.

For clustering, we first subsampled the trajectories by selecting
MD frames at every nanosecond of the simulation segments from 100
to 200 ns. In other words, we discarded the first half of each run
for allowing the ligand to equilibrate in the binding pocket. The
bound frames were selected according to the distance between the N
atom of C433 and the thiourea sulfur atom and choosing frames with
a distance lower than 5 Å. We applied PCA to a set of 10 protein–ligand
distances to reduce the data to two dimensions. These 10 distances
involved atoms of the thiourea ring and the residues C433 (four distances),
D422 (two distances), and Y418, W432, W486, and W491 (one distance
each). The Gaussian mixture algorithm with full covariance was employed
for clustering the two-dimensional data in PC space. The MD snapshot
closest to the center of the cluster (centroid) was used as a representative
pose. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the ligand in the binding
pocket was calculated for all of the trajectories. First, all MD snapshots
were overlapped with the equilibrated starting structure using the
Cα atoms of the protein. Then the coordinates of the heavy atoms
of the ligand were employed for the calculation of the RMSD. All analyses
were done using MDTraj and SciKit learn.
