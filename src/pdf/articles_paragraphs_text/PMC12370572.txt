Chilling stress can severely damage rice and lead to yield losses. The genetic mechanisms underlying responses of rice to chilling stress are complex and can vary depending on the genetic background, developmental stage, and experimental conditions. In this study, we used the chilling stress–tolerantjaponicavariety Taiken 9 (TK9) and the chilling stress–sensitiveindicavariety Taichung Sen 17 (TCS17) to investigate the genetic basis of chilling tolerance in rice seedlings. A BC3-derived backcross inbred line, NSY1051070, which inherited high chilling tolerance from TK9 within the genetic background of TCS17, was developed through recurrent backcross breeding. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL),qCTS11-TK9, was identified in the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 11 by using F2and F3populations derived from the cross between TCS17 and NSY1051070. High-resolution linkage analysis delimitedqCTS11-TK9to a 191-kb genomic region containing 16 annotated putative genes in the rice reference genome. Expression and sequence analyses revealed three candidate genes responsible for chilling tolerance in NSY1051070:LOC_Os11g42790,LOC_Os11g42800, andLOC_Os11g42850. Our findings unveiled a novel major QTL associated with chilling tolerance in rice seedlings. The discovery ofqCTS11-TK9highlights a new source of seedling-stage chilling tolerance, and the markers developed in this study may aid future breeding programs.

Global climate change poses a threat to crop productivity worldwide, and therefore, elite crop varieties are required that are resilient and adaptable to climate change. Asia-cultivated rice (Oryza sativaL.) originated in tropical and subtropical regions, gradually spreading across the globe and becoming a crop capable of adapting to diverse climatic conditions (Liu et al.2007; Molina et al.2011). The two main subspecies of Asia-cultivated rice areindicaandjaponica.Indicavarieties are cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, whereasjaponicavarieties are cultivated in temperate regions. During the germination and seedling stages,indicarice varieties are generally more sensitive to low temperatures thanjaponicarice varieties (Baruah et al.2009). Chilling stress can markedly affect many growth stages of rice, leading to severe plant damage and substantial yield losses (Li et al.2022a). Therefore, enhancing the chilling tolerance ofindicarice through breeding strategies is essential to stabilize rice production.

Chilling tolerance in rice is a multifaceted genetic trait influenced by various environmental factors, such as temperature, exposure duration, light, and relative humidity (Andaya and Mackill2003; Zhang et al.2014; Yang et al.2020; Li et al.2022a,b). Furthermore, the genetic mechanisms underlying the response of rice to chilling stress vary across growth stages (Yang et al.2020; Li et al.2022a). Cold exposure can cause leaf curling, yellowing, wilting, and death in rice seedlings, leading to considerable economic losses. To address these problems, rice research has been conducted involving quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and high-resolution mapping, and it has revealed multiple key genes associated with chilling tolerance at the seedling stage—for example,OsGSTZ2,COLD1,qCTS-9,HAN1,cpt-1,COLD11,COG1,COG2,COG3, andOsCTS11(Kim et al.2011; Ma et al.2015; Zhao et al.2017; Mao et al.2019; Baruah et al.2023; Feng et al.2023; Li et al.2023; Xia et al.2023; Liu et al.2024; Wu et al.2024).

In Taiwan, the rice transplanting period for the first cropping season typically occurs from late January to late February. However, recent extreme climate events have caused substantial temperature fluctuations. Consequently,indicarice seedlings in Taiwan often face severe damage due to low temperatures (< 10 °C) after transplanting. Notably, mostjaponicavarieties in the region exhibit more favorable chilling tolerance under similar conditions. NSY1051070, a BC3-derived line with enhanced seedling-stage chilling tolerance, was selected through ourindicarice breeding program. It was derived from a cross between Taichung Sen 17 (TCS17), an eliteindicavariety used as the recurrent parent, and Taiken 9 (TK9), ajaponicavariety used as the donor parent. Notably, TCS17 is sensitive to chilling stress at the seedling stage, whereas TK9 exhibits chilling tolerance at this stage. In this study, we explored key chilling tolerance–associated QTL in NSY1051070 through QTL mapping, QTL-seq, and high-resolution mapping. Our findings offer valuable insights into chilling tolerance in rice seedlings and may inform future breeding efforts for climate-resilient rice.

Three-leaf stage seedlings of TCS17, TK9, and NSY1051070 were incubated at 5 °C for 5 days (treatment period) and then at 25 °C/20°C (day/night) for 7 days (recovery period). After treatment, the aerial parts of the TCS17 plants exhibited severe damage, with most leaves wilting or dying. TCS17 had a posttreatment chilling tolerance scale (CTS) score of 4.75 and a survival rate of 14.3% (Fig.1). By contrast, TK9 exhibited strong chilling tolerance at the seedling stage, with only mild damage to the aerial parts and slight yellowing at the leaf tips. TK9 had a posttreatment CTS score of 1.33 and a survival rate of 100% (Fig.1). NSY1051070 exhibited moderate chilling tolerance at the seedling stage. NSY1051070 had a posttreatment CTS score of 2.33 and a survival rate of 93.8% (Fig.1).

To identify the QTL associated with chilling tolerance, we performed QTL mapping by using a segregating population of 133 F2individuals derived from a cross between TCS17 and NSY1051070. Their posttreatment CTS scores ranged from 2 to 5, exhibiting a bimodal distribution (Additional file 1: Fig.S1). Subsequently, the F2individuals were genotyped using the double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) strategy, which yielded 1,166.8 million 150-bp paired-end reads. From these reads, we identified 298 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SNPs were merged into 74 bin markers on the basis of phased genotypes, defined by parental polymorphisms and contiguous regions of identical phased genotypes in each F2individual. Among the F2individuals, eight chromosomal intervals exhibited segregating genotypes between TCS17 and NSY1051070 (Fig.2A): 1 L-a (chromosome 1: 26.9–29.1 Mb), 1 L-b (chromosome 1: 32.7–35.5 Mb), 3 L (chromosome 3: 24.5–30.4 Mb), 4 S (chromosome 4: 0–5.6 Mb), 6 L (chromosome 6: 26.0–26.2 Mb), 7 L (chromosome 7: 17.2–21.3 Mb), 9 S (chromosome 9: 6.6–7.2 Mb), and 11 L (chromosome 11: 25.8–29.0 Mb). QTL analysis conducted using the 133 F2individuals and the bin markers from the aforementioned 8 intervals revealed a single QTL (25.82–28.07 Mb) on chromosome 11, which we designatedqCTS11-TK9(Fig.2A; Additional file 1: Fig.S2). This QTL explained 46.6% of the total phenotypic variance in the mapping population (Table1). Furthermore, the absence of significant LOD scores on other chromosomal intervals suggests that the chilling tolerance observed in NSY1051070 is unlikely to be associated with loci outside 11 L chromosomal region.

The number of SNPs identified using the ddRAD-seq strategy was insufficient, potentially resulting in imprecise chromosomal intervals in the QTL mapping. To further validate that the causal gene(s) responsible for chilling tolerance are located within the 11 L chromosomal region, we determined the CTS scores of 500 F3individuals derived from an F2plant that was heterozygous in the 11 L chromosomal region and homozygous in all other chromosomal segments (Additional file 1: Fig.S3). Using such a genetically fixed background ensures that the observed phenotypic variation in QTL-seq analyses can be attributed with confidence to genetic variation within the 11 L chromosomal region. On the basis of phenotypic data, we pooled DNA from 50 individuals with high sensitivity to chilling stress (CTS score = 5) into a bulk sample, designated Bulk_S, and DNA from 50 individuals with high tolerance to chilling stress (CTS score = 2) into another sample, designated Bulk_R. Subsequently, we performed whole-genome sequencing of TCS17, TK9, Bulk_S, and Bulk_R, which yielded 164.5 million paired-end reads (35.5 million for TCS17, 36.9 million for TK9, 51.9 million for Bulk_S, and 40.2 million for Bulk_R). The average aligned sequencing depths were 24.1× for TCS17, 25.5× for TK9, 26.2× for Bulk_S, and 25.8× for Bulk_R. Variant calling unveiled 2,670 reliable variants, including 1,992 SNPs and 678 indels among TCS17, TK9, Bulk_S, and Bulk_R. Using these variants, we calculated the SNP index (allele frequency of TK9) for each variant in both bulk samples and calculated the ΔSNP index by subtracting the SNP index of Bulk_R from that of Bulk_S. The SNP index of Bulk_S within the 25.60 ~ 26.10 Mb region on chromosome 11 ranged from 0.26 to 0.29, while that of Bulk_R ranged from 0.58 to 0.72. The ΔSNP index in this region ranged from − 0.29 to − 0.46, which exceeds the 95% significance threshold. These results indicated that there was a major QTL controlling chilling tolerance at the 25.60 ~ 26.10 Mb region on chromosome 11. (Fig.2B). Variants information within the significant QTL interval (25.60–26.10 Mb) are listed in Additional file 2. The QTL intervals identified through QTL-seq and QTL mapping partially overlapped, supporting the notion thatqCTS11-TK9, located on the long arm of chromosome 11, confers chilling tolerance.

To identify the causal gene(s) ofqCTS11-TK9, we genotyped 1,760 F3individuals (derived from the same source as that used for QTL-seq) by using the flanking markers CT2560 (located at 25.60 Mb of chromosome 11) and CT2626 (located at 26.26 Mb of chromosome 11). The results revealed 18 recombinants with a single crossover between these markers. To generate a high-resolution map ofqCTS11-TK9, we genotyped these recombinants by using six additional polymorphic kompetitive allele–specific PCR (KASP) markers located between CT2560 and CT2626. By comparing the phenotypic and genotypic data of these recombinant lines, particularly the A396, B624, B097, and B498 lines, we delimitedqCTS11-TK9to a 191-kb interval between CT2562 (25.62 Mb) and CT2581 (25.81 Mb) (Fig.3A). Data from the Michigan State University Rice Genome Annotation Project Database (Kawahara et al.2013;http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) indicated that the 191-kb interval in the Nipponbare reference genome contains 16 putative genes and 13 annotated transposable elements (Fig.3B; Additional file 3: TableS1). Furthermore, the molecular markers CT2563 and CT2577 were found to co-segregate with the phenotype for seedling chilling tolerance (Fig.3A). These markers are considered suitable for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS).

When aligning the sequences using Nipponbare as the reference genome, the genome coverage at theqCTS11-TK9locus was found to be 99.5% in TK9, while it was only 44.5% in TCS17. This discrepancy suggests the presence of structural variation in TCS17 within this genomic region. To investigate this possibility, we performed additional whole-genome sequencing of TCS17 at approximately 100× coverage, followed byde novogenome assembly. Comparative analysis with the Nipponbare reference genome revealed a 135.7-kb deletion at theqCTS11-TK9locus in the TCS17 genome (Fig.3C; Additional file 1: Fig.S4; Additional file 4). To validate the accuracy of the TCS17de novogenome assembly, two primer pairs, 135D-1 and 135D-2, were designed, with the forward primers located upstream of the 135.7-kb deletion and the reverse primers located downstream, for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (Fig.3C). The results showed that both primer pairs successfully amplified the expected PCR products in TCS17. In contrast, neither 135D-1 nor 135D-2 produced specific PCR bands in TK9 or NSY1051070 (Additional File 1: Fig.S5). Our findings indicated that theqCTS11-TK9locus in TCS17 spanned only 55.3-kb and contained seven intact putative genes and two transposable elements (Fig.3C; Additional file 3: TableS1).

To investigate the correlations between the expression levels of 16 putative genes and phenotypic variations, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on three-leaf stage seedlings of TCS17 and TCS17qCTS11 − TK9(an F4-derived inbred line) under two conditions (pretreatment and posttreatment conditions). Among the 16 putative genes within the 191-kb interval, only three were expressed under at least one treatment condition in TCS17 or TCS17qCTS11 − TK9(Table2):LOC_Os11g42790,LOC_Os11g42800, andLOC_Os11g42850. On the basis of the RNA-seq results, we excluded the 13 genes that were not expressed in any sample. To validate the RNA-seq results, we performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on the three candidate genes in both TCS17 and TCS17qCTS11 − TK9across the two conditions. After treatment, the expression ofLOC_Os11g42790andLOC_Os11g42850was significantly upregulated, whereas that ofLOC_Os11g42800was significantly downregulated (Fig.4). Furthermore, the posttreatment expression levels ofLOC_Os11g42790andLOC_Os11g42850were significantly lower in TCS17qCTS11 − TK9than in TCS17 (Fig.4).

Differences between TCS17 and TK9 in the coding sequences of the three candidate genes were analyzed through Sanger sequencing. InLOC_Os11g42790, 47 SNPs were detected in the coding region, leading to 8 amino acid changes (Additional files 5 and 6). InLOC_Os11g42800, 20 SNPs were detected in the coding region, leading to 5 amino acid changes (Additional files 7 and 8). Finally, inLOC_Os11g42850, two SNPs were detected in the coding region, leading to one amino acid change (Additional files 9 and 10).

We identified a novel QTL associated with chilling tolerance in rice seedlings and designated itqCTS11-TK9. This QTL is located within the 25.62–25.81 Mb region on chromosome 11. Several QTL associated with seedling-stage chilling tolerance have been reported on the long arm of chromosome 11—for example, loci identified in biparental mapping populations (Zhang et al.2005; Baruah et al.2009; Koseki et al.2010; Wang et al.2011; Kim et al.2014; Ranawake et al.2014; Mao et al.2019; Schläppi et al.2023; Xia et al.2023; Liu et al.2024; Wu et al.2024) and those identified through GWAS (Lv et al.2016; Wang et al.2016; Shimoyama et al.2020; Li et al.2022b; Rastogi et al.2025). Within the QTL on chromosome 11, six genes have been cloned thus far:HAN1,COG1,ctp-1,COLD11,COG3, andOsCTS11(Mao et al.2019; Baruah et al.2023; Xia et al.2023; Li et al.2023; Liu et al.2024; Wu et al.2024).HAN1, located at 16.99 Mb, encodes an oxidase that enhances chilling tolerance by regulating JA-Ile metabolism (Mao et al.2019).COG1, located at 21.30 Mb, encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein localized to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum; this protein forms a complex with OsSERL2 to facilitate cold signal sensing and thus enhance chilling tolerance (Xia et al.2023). Furthermore,ctp-1, located at 21.88 Mb, encodes a nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-like protein; a 73 bp frameshift deletion in this gene may confer chilling tolerance (Baruah et al.2023).COLD11, located at 23.95 Mb, encodes the DNA repair protein RAD51A1, which is crucial in repairing DNA double-strand breaks under chilling stress (Li et al.2023).COG3, located at 27.01 Mb, encodes a putative calmodulin-binding protein; this protein determines photosynthetic efficiency under chilling stress (Liu et al.2024).OsCTS11, located at 24.23 Mb, encodes a stress-enhanced protein, but its function remains unclear (Wu et al.2024). Although extensive reports have been published regarding chilling tolerance genes on chromosome 11 (Mao et al.2019; Baruah et al.2023; Li et al.2023; Xia et al.2023; Liu et al.2024; Wu et al.2024), none overlap with theqCTS11-TK9locus identified in our study.

To identify the causal gene inqCTS11-TK9, we annotated 16 putative genes within the 191-kb interval harboring theqCTS11-TK9locus (Fig.3B). RNA-seq revealed that 13 of the 16 genes were not expressed under the study conditions in TCS17 or TCS17qCTS11 − TK9. Thus, these genes could not be causal genes.LOC_Os11g42790,LOC_Os11g42800, andLOC_Os11g42850emerged as potential causal genes.LOC_Os11g42790, known asOsNHX2, encodes an Na+/H+exchanger (NHX). NHX-type genes are essential incompartmentalizing Na+ions into vacuoles and conferring salt tolerance (Zhu2003; Teng et al.2017). Studies suggest that some NHX genes may also regulate plant responses to drought and cold stress (Fan et al.2015; Qu et al.2020).LOC_Os11g42800encodes a kinesin motor domain–containing protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, such as cell division, cargo transport, organelle distribution, and cell polarity (Endow2003; Lu and Gelfand2017). Notably,LOC_Os11g42800determines the proportion of postmilling intact grains inindicarice, as evidenced by GWAS (Misra et al.2019). AlthoughLOC_Os11g42850is known to encode a protein, its function remains unknown. Collectively, the aforementioned three genes represent the most likely candidate causal genes conferring chilling tolerance in NSY1051070. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional, novel gene(s)—absent from the Nipponbare reference genome—may reside within the 135.7 kb insertion region in TK9. These novel genes could potentially arise from an additional insertion event in TK9 or reflect sequence divergence between TK9 and Nipponbare. Further studies are required to determine the causal gene responsible for the chilling tolerance inqCTS11-TK9.

Chilling tolerance in rice seedlings has been extensively investigated, with considerable efforts focused on genetic mapping. Notably, chilling stress–tolerant genes have been identified from diverse genetic materials, and several corresponding QTL have been mapped to the same chromosome. Therefore, continued QTL mapping using different genetic backgrounds may provide valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying chilling tolerance in rice seedlings.

The response of rice to chilling stress is complex, and differences in genetic materials and low-temperature treatment conditions can yield variable QTL mapping results. In this study, we employed QTL mapping, QTL-seq, and high-resolution mapping to identify a novel major QTL,qCTS11-TK9, associated with chilling tolerance in rice seedlings. This QTL significantly reduces seedling damage and mortality under chilling stress. In addition, we developed molecular markers co-segregating withqCTS11-TK9. The findings of this study can be applied in marker-assisted selection to enhance seedling-stage chilling tolerance inindicarice.

We developed a BC3-derived backcross inbred line (NSY1051070), which exhibited chilling tolerance inherited from TK9 within the genetic background of TCS17. QTL mapping was performed using the F2population derived from a cross between TCS17 and NSY1051070. For QTL-seq and high-resolution mapping, we used the F3population from an F2plant that was heterozygous in the 11 L region and homozygous in the remaining chromosomal segments (Additional file 1: Fig.S3). For RNA-seq, we used an F4-derived inbred line (TCS17qCTS11 − TK9), which was homozygous for theqCTS11-TK9allele from TK9 within the genetic background of TCS17 and exhibited chilling tolerance. The breeding scheme used for developing the mapping populations is depicted in Additional file 1: Fig.S6.

Rice seeds were germinated and cultivated to the three-leaf stage in a growth chamber at 30 °C/25°C (day/night) under a 12-h photoperiod. Subsequently, seedlings at the three-leaf stage were incubated at 5 °C (24-h dark) for 5 days (treatment period) and then at 25 °C/20°C (12-h light/dark) for 7 days (recovery period). On the basis of the phenotypic evaluation results, we stratified the treated plants into five CTS score categories according to the extent of damage: CTS1, CTS2, CTS3, CTS4, and CTS5. CTS1 indicated no visible damage to the aerial parts. CTS2 indicated wilting of > 50% of the first leaf. CTS3 indicated wilting of 100% the first leaf and > 50% of the second leaf. CTS4 indicated wilting of 100% of the first and second leaves and > 50% of the third leaf. Finally, CTS5 indicated plant death. The five CTS categories are depicted in Additional file 1: Fig.S7.

The genotypes of 133 F2individuals derived from a cross between TCS17 and NSY1051070 were determined using the ddRAD-seq strategy. The ddRAD library was constructed as described by Peterson et al. (2012). DNA libraries were sequenced as 150-bp paired-end reads by using the Illumina X Ten system at Genomics (Taipei, Taiwan). Raw sequence data were demultiplexed and trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 11.0) and then mapped to the Nipponbare reference genome IRGSP1.0 (Kawahara et al.2013) by using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg2012). SNPs were identified from the processed sequencing data by using the Stacks package (Catchen et al.2013). Each SNP site represented a DNA marker. For each F2individual, marker genotypes were scored on the basis of SNP data across all chromosomes. Low-quality SNPs (read depth < 10 or missing data per locus > 50) were removed, with 298 SNPs retained in the data set. To minimize missing data, SNP calling errors, and redundant markers in the genotypic data of the 133 F2individuals, genotype imputation and merging were performed using Binmarker (version 2.3) (Qin et al.2022). Finally, 74 reliable bin markers remained. The genotypes of these bin markers were used to construct a linkage map by using the R/qtl package (Broman et al.2003). QTL analysis was performed using the bin marker–derived genotypic data and CTS phenotypic data of the 133 F2individuals by using the composite interval mapping (CIM) method in R/qtl (Broman et al.2003). The threshold for QTL detection was empirically determined using a 1,000-permutation test at a 0.05 significance level.

Four genomic DNA libraries—two extreme bulks (Bulk_S and Bulk_R) and two parents (TCS17 and TK9) were prepared and whole-genome sequenced as 150-bp paired-end reads at Genomics. Paired-end reads were trimmed to remove adapters and low-quality bases (Phred score < 20) using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al.2014). The filtered reads were then aligned to the Nipponbare reference genome (IRGSP 1.0; Kawahara et al.2013) using BWA-MEM (Li and Durbin2010). Variant calling for the entire dataset, including TCS17, TK9, bulk1, and bulk2, was conducted using the mpileup command in SAMtools (Li et al.2009). For subsequent analysis, we retained only variants that were homozygous reference (0/0) in TK9 and homozygous alternate (1/1) in TCS17. We then calculated the SNP index and ΔSNP index using the QTL-plot command in QTL-seq (Takagi et al.2013). The sliding window analysis of the ΔSNP index was carried out with a 500-kb window size and a 50-kb step size. Additionally, genome coverages for TCS17 and TK9 were assessed using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall2010).

Genotypes of 1,760 F3individuals were determined using the flanking KASP markers CT2560 and CT2626. Eighteen recombinants with single crossover events between CT2560 and CT2626 were identified and self-pollinated twice to produce homozygous F4:5lines for progeny testing. All recombinants were further genotyped with six additional KASP markers. For progeny testing, 4–7 individuals per line were used, with 4 replications per line. A randomized complete block design was used in all trials. Data were analyzed using R (version 4.2.1). Dunnett’s multiple range test was performed to compare means among the recombinant lines, with TCS17 serving as the control. The primers used for high-resolution mapping are listed in Additional file 3: TableS2.

To investigate structural variations within theqCTS11-TK9locus, the whole genome of TCS17 was re-sequenced. Genomic DNA libraries were constructed and sequenced as 150-bp paired-end reads at Genomics. Approximately 180.4 million raw reads were obtained using the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform. The paired-end reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al.2014) to remove adapters and bases with quality scores of < 20. A total of 177.2 million clean reads were retained and de-novo-assembled using the MaSuRCA genome assembler (Zimin et al.2013) at Genomics. The assembly quality was assessed using QUAST (Gurevich et al.2013). To detect potential structural variations within the TCS17 genome, the TCS17 and Nipponbare reference genome sequences at theqCTS11-TK9locus were aligned using MUMmer4 (Marçais et al.2018). To verify the presence of the 135.7-kb deletion in the TCS17 genome, we designed two primer pairs flanking the upstream and downstream regions of the deletion for PCR amplification. Each PCR reaction contained 5 µL of 5× KAPA HiFi Fidelity buffer (Kapa Biosystems, South Africa), 0.75 µL of 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.75 µL of 10 µM forward primer, 0.75 µL of 10 µM reverse primer, 0.5 µL of 1 U/µL DNA polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, South Africa), and 100 ng of template DNA. The final volume was adjusted to 25 µL with ddH₂O. PCR was performed using the following thermal cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; 38 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 61 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 5 min; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris–borate–EDTA (TBE) buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. The sequences of primer pairs, 135D-1 and 135D-2, are listed in Additional file 3: TableS3.

Approximately 100 seeds each of TCS17 and TCS17qCTS11 − TK9were germinated and cultivated in a growth chamber at 30 °C/25°C (day/night) until the three-leaf stage. At this stage, some seedlings from each genotype were harvested for total RNA isolation and designated TCS17 (before) and TCS17qCTS11 − TK9(before). The remaining seedlings were incubated at 5 °C for 5 days. Subsequently, these seedlings were harvested for total RNA isolation and designated TCS17 (after) and TCS17qCTS11 − TK9(after). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit with RNase-free DNase I (QIAGEN, Germany). RNA-seq was performed with three biological replicates per sample. Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed and sequenced at Genomics. Approximately 35 million raw reads were obtained per sample by using the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform. Raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) (Bolger et al.2014) to remove adapters and low-quality bases (score < 20). Clean reads were mapped to IRGSP1.0 by using HISAT2 (Kim et al.2019). Raw counts were obtained using HTSeq-count (Anders et al.2015). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the edgeR package (Robinson et al.2010) in R. Genes with low expression levels (count-per-million value < 2) were removed. Trimmed mean of M-value normalization was performed to adjust for library size differences across samples.

The transcription levels of the candidate genes were determined through RT-qPCR. All RT-qPCR assays were conducted with three biological and three technical replicates. For each assay, 0.6 µg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, USA). RT-qPCR was performed using a CFX96 Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Singapore). The final reaction volume was 20 µL. RT-qPCR was performed using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, South Africa). RiceeEF-1αwas used as the internal control (Jain et al.2006). The primers used for gene expression analysis are listed in Additional file 3: TableS4.

Genomic DNA samples extracted from TCS17 and TK9 were used as templates for PCR. The primers used for DNA sequencingLOC_Os11g42790,LOC_Os11g42800, andLOC_Os11g42850are listed in Additional file 3: TableS5. To avoid the introduction of false nucleotide polymorphisms during amplification, three independent amplicons per primer–template combination were pooled and subjected to Sanger sequencing.
