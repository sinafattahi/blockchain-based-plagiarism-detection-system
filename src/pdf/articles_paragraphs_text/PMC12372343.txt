Critical thinking is a fundamental yet overlooked skill of nursing education, crucial for equipping future nurses to navigate complex clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, conventional learning methods often emphasize individual learning modes, thereby neglecting collaborative opportunities such as teamwork and role-playing. Also, traditional nursing education focuses on the training of hands-on practice, but the lack of contextualized learning through clinical scenario simulation limits the development of critical thinking, ultimately hindering the full potential of nursing education. This study aimed to assess the effects of a Collaborative Role Playing-Based Virtual Reality Flipped Learning (CRP-based VR-FL) approach in nursing education.

A mixed-methods quasi-experimental study enrolled 133 nursing students via class-matching. CRP-based and non-CRP VR-FL methods were compared over a one-month intravenous (IV) infusion training programme. The research evaluated the impact of these instructional strategies on students’ learning achievement and critical thinking skills by administering pre- and post-tests on knowledge related to IV infusions, a pre- and post-test critical thinking tendencies questionnaire, and a self-assessment.

The CRP-based VR-FL approach significantly improved IV infusion knowledge (p< 0.05) and critical thinking, particularly in decision-making (p< 0.05), though attitudinal differences were non-significant (p> 0.1). Furthermore, based on the students’ self-assessments, it is evident that this method significantly enhanced students’ learning experiences, including engagement, participation, teamwork, and independent learning skills.

Consequently, it is recommended that nursing education actively pursue and implement the CRP-based VR-FL approach to cultivate high-quality nursing professionals.

Critical thinking (CT)—defined as a tripartite construct that integrates attitudes, knowledge, and skills [1]—is essential for nurses as they navigate complex clinical scenarios and prioritize patient care [2,3]. In contemporary nursing practice, CT goes beyond mere procedural tasks, facilitating the synthesis of multifaceted information, fostering innovation in problem-solving, and enhancing patient outcomes [4,5].

Traditional nursing education, which relies heavily on didactic teaching, clinical simulations, and hands-on practice, encounters significant limitations in fostering CT. Didactic methods frequently isolate students, thereby restricting peer interaction, the discussion of ambiguous cases, and the immediate feedback that is essential for refining clinical judgment and mitigating bias [6]. Simulations are limited by resource availability, time constraints, and the relevance of scenarios [7] while clinical placements provide inconsistent exposure to a variety of cases and practical opportunities due to environmental complexity and case variability [8]. These pedagogical gaps highlight the need for innovative approaches.

Flipped Learning (FL) and Virtual Reality (VR) have emerged as promising educational solutions. FL reverses traditional instructions: students acquire foundational knowledge prior to class, reserving in-person sessions for practical activities. This model effectively bridges the gaps between theory and practice, enhances student engagement, and fosters problem-solving abilities [9,10,11]. VR complements FL by providing immersive, risk-free environments for procedural training, clinical decision-making, and repetitive practice tailored to individual learner needs [12,13]. Research indicates that VR significantly enhances critical thinking components, such as judgment under pressure [14,15].

The integration of VR and FL (VR-FL) synergizes flexibility with immersion. Pre-class materials are aligned with preparatory activities, while in-class VR laboratories facilitate active participation [16]. However, VR-FL encounters several challenges: cognitive load resulting from simultaneous processing of theoretical knowledge and multisensory inputs [17] and limited structured collaboration in standard in-class activities, such as discussions and case studies, which hinders interactive clinical reasoning [16].

This study utilized a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of the CRP-based VR-FL approach on critical thinking within a core nursing competency, specifically intravenous (IV) infusion skills. The research was conducted at a health vocational college in south China. The intervention and data collection took place over the course of one month.

Two cohorts of nursing students (totaln= 133) were selected after verifying comparable baseline competencies through specific criteria. For example, evaluations of fundamental knowledge comprehension, assessments of learning capabilities (including logical reasoning, knowledge retention, and practical skills), and reviews of prior course grades were conducted. One cohort was assigned to the control group (n= 66), while the other was designated as the experimental group (n= 67). To address the absence of a pre-study power analysis, a sensitivity analysis confirmed that the sample size could detect clinically significant effects (Cohen’s d = 0.48 at α = 0.05, power = 80%), which is below the field’s minimum important difference (d = 0.50) [24]. To minimize confounding variables, both groups received theoretical instructions from the same instructor and utilized the VR-FL teaching model. The experimental variable was manipulated by isolating CRP and non-CRP conditions.

The experimental group underwent CRP training during IV infusion practice, whereas the control group engaged in traditional individual practice.

Pre-class (1 week): All participants engaged with IV infusion videos and practiced virtually on the V-Care Nursing Virtual Simulation Platform (Fig.1), which offered personalized feedback tailored to their proficiency.

The theoretical class (90 min) involved both groups observing peer demonstrations on a smart whiteboard, followed by instructor-led discussions addressing various challenges. Students then practiced independently using mobile VR, with guidance from the instructor (Fig.2).

Figure3illustrates a role-playing activity conducted within teams, which included nurses, patients, family members, and healthcare staff in the experimental group. The roles encompassed managing patient anxiety, addressing family inquiries, and facilitating collaborative problem-solving (e.g., challenging punctures), while fostering critical thinking through effective communication and the optimization of strategies. In the control group, the instructor demonstrated the procedure, followed by individual practice, during which guidance was sought exclusively from the instructor.

The experimental procedure (Fig.4) consists of three sequential phases: First, after one week of pre-class learning, all participants completed a pre-test to assess their foundational knowledge and critical thinking skills. Subsequently, both groups participated in a combined session that included a 90-minute theoretical class followed immediately by a 90-minute practical training session. Finally, at the conclusion of the study, participants undertook a post-test that measures knowledge and critical thinking and completed a self-assessment.

Data were collected using three validated instruments: (1) a knowledge test consisting of 20 multiple-choice questions (maximum score: 100 points), developed by expert nursing instructors and exhibiting high reliability (KR20 = 0.83); (2) the Critical Thinking Tendency Questionnaire, a 12-item, 6-point Likert scale instrument validated in nursing contexts to assess attitudes, creativity, and decision-making, demonstrating good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.79); and (3) a self-assessment of learning approaches, adapted from Zink and Schmidt’s (1998) framework to evaluate self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and the implementation of corrective strategies. All instruments were administered anonymously via an online platform, with participant responses coded as EG (Experimental Group) or CG (Control Group) to ensure confidentiality.

Statistical analyses were conducted using dual approaches. For quantitative data, SPSS 27.0 was utilized to perform independent samples t-tests, complemented by linear mixed-effects models to address the limitations of the quasi-experimental design. These models accounted for variability between groups, individual temporal differences and confounding factors (e.g., prior grades).

For qualitative self-assessment data, thematic analysis was conducted following the framework established by Braun and Clarke [25] in MAXQDA24. Codes were systematically categorized into three core themes (Fig.5), and inter-coder reliability was rigorously verified using Kappa coefficients to ensure the robustness of the analysis.

To mitigate potential confounding effects, multiple strategies were implemented across both experimental and analytical stages: Prior knowledge was controlled through pre-tests and baseline equivalence verification, ensuring initial group comparability. Variability in group dynamics was minimized by standardizing role-play scenarios with predefined responsibilities (e.g., nurses managing family inquiries) for the experimental cohort. Instructor-related confounders were addressed by employing identical theoretical instructors and content delivery, supplemented by video recordings of practical sessions for consistency audits. Finally, statistical control was achieved by incorporating baseline scores and prior academic performance as covariates in linear mixed-effects models, thereby quantitatively adjusting for residual heterogeneity.

Table1presents a comparison of the differences in gender, age, and GPA between the control group (n= 66) and the experimental group (n= 67). The chi-square test revealed that the gender difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.67); similarly, the independent samples t-test indicated that the differences in age (p= 0.35) and GPA (p= 0.57) were also not statistically significant. In conclusion, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the measured variables.

Figure6presents a comparison of pre-test and post-test knowledge scores between the experimental and control groups, including error bars representing 95% confidence intervals.

In the pre-test phase, no significant difference was observed between the experimental group (M = 81.79, SD = 13.70) and the control group (M = 79.39, SD = 12.88), t (130) = 1.04,p= 0.30, 95% CI [-2.17, 6.96]. However, in the post-test phase, the experimental group (M = 89.85, SD = 13.64) demonstrated significantly higher scores than the control group (M = 81.79, SD = 19.99), t (130) = 2.72,p= 0.008, 95% CI [2.18, 13.94], with Cohen’sd= 0.47 (indicating a medium effect size) supporting practical significance.

Assumption checks confirmed approximate normality through visual inspection of histograms (Fig.7) and Q-Q plots (Fig.8). The Levene’s test indicated homogeneity of variances (pre-test: F (1, 130) = 0.23,p= 0.632; post-test: F (1, 130) = 3.21,p= 0.075), validating the use of parametric tests. These findings suggest the intervention effectively improved scores, supporting its efficacy.

As illustrated in Table2, the pre-test results indicated no significant differences between the experimental and control classes across the attitude, creativity, and decision-making dimensions of critical thinking disposition. For the attitude dimension specifically, the experimental group (M = 3.46, SD = 0.49) and control group (M = 3.34, SD = 0.62) yielded a t-value of 1.15 (df = 123,p= 0.25), confirming the absence of a significant difference here. Consistent with this pattern, non-significant differences were also observed in the creativity and decision-making dimensions. However, the results of the post-questionnaire indicated that in the decision-making dimension, the difference between the experimental group (M = 4.48, SD = 0.55) and the control group (M = 4.76, SD = 0.69) was significant (t = 2.50,p< 0.05), suggesting that the experimental group outperformed the control group in this dimension. In contrast, with respect to the attitudinal dimension, both groups exhibited comparable performance, and the difference did not reach a significant level (t = 1.15,p> 0.10). Similarly, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding creativity.

Table3presents self-assessment categorizations. It covers three core themes: mastering IV infusion knowledge/skills, offline training experience, and critical thinking development.

Specifically, we divide participants into the CRP-based VR-FL group and Non-CRP-based VR-FL group, showcasing their views on teaching methods under these themes.

The VR-FL has significantly enhanced interest and participation in learning. Most students reported that, with the assistance of VR technology, they were able to engage in highly realistic IV infusion operation practice within the V-Care Nursing Virtual Simulation Platform system. Upon entering this highly reproducible virtual ward, students like EG1 below felt as though they were in an actual hospital environment, complete with all the necessary equipment and lifelike virtual patients awaiting their treatment.

Furthermore, the implementation of the platform not only increased the enjoyment and interactivity of the learning experience but also transcended the temporal and spatial limitations inherent in traditional classroom instruction. Prior to class, students could preview the IV infusion operation by watching instructional videos, thereby gaining a preliminary understanding of the material they were about to study. EG7 indicated that this pre-practice learning approach enabled students to engage more actively in the educational process, thereby deepening their comprehension and retention of IV infusion knowledge and skills.

The collaborative role-play learning model fostered a conducive offline practical training environment. Students effectively collaborated with their group members to complete the IV infusion task. Some took charge of the operation, while others provided close assistance by handing and holding the instruments and monitoring the patient’s reaction. When confronted with an emergency situation, such as a simulated patient experiencing a reaction to an infusion, students were able to respond in an organized manner based on the emergency protocols they had learned in the VR classroom. Participants actively shared their perspectives on the challenges encountered, collaboratively analyzed procedural and interpersonal dynamics, and explored innovative solutions to enhance clinical practice. This integrative approach not only reinforced technical proficiency but also strengthened team cohesion. By fostering a culture of mutual learning and open dialogue, the exercise cultivated a supportive environment in which collective problem-solving and knowledge exchange drove measurable progress. This experience underscores the value of combining immersive technologies with collaborative reflection to achieve both task mastery and professional growth.

The CRP-FL model further enhanced independent learning. EG5 noted in his self-reflection that when he encountered theoretical confusion while acquiring the knowledge and skills related to IV infusion, he was able to visually comprehend the impact of infusion speed on patients by watching the videos provided by the teacher and the VR simulation of the infusion process for different medications. When EG42 mentioned that he found himself lacking in practical training operations, he reviewed the operational demonstrations in the VR system, compared his own techniques, and identified areas for improvement.

However, students also encountered several challenges while utilizing the VR platform. EG5 and EG2 reported negative experiences, such as occasional lag that disrupted usage and the necessity to restart the application after accidentally exiting, which may diminish their motivation to engage with it. Furthermore, while collaborative role-playing can enhance teamwork, some students noted that time was wasted due to unskilled operation during practical training, which impacted overall efficiency and may foster negative learning attitudes. In this context, many students desired to develop their clinical resilience through increased VR simulation training and practical exercises. They aspired to leverage the collaborative simulation role-playing feature of VR to explore and navigate the virtual environment, thereby enhancing their skills and self-confidence in managing unexpected situations. Simultaneously, by integrating offline collaborative role-playing, they collaborated with team members to tackle challenges presented in simulated scenarios, thereby strengthening their teamwork and clinical resilience.

Enhancing one’s practical skills is an essential aspect of every learner’s journey towards skill acquisition and practical application. In the field of nursing education, particularly concerning hands-on skills such as IV infusion, the enhancement of practical skills is of paramount importance. CG7 has reported that, through the instructor’s demonstration, coupled with pre-course previews and VR exercises, the process not only became more systematic and efficient but also significantly ignited their enthusiasm for exploring the unknown and engaging in hands-on practice.

Furthermore, CG4 indicated that the teacher’s live demonstration offered her an intuitive and vivid illustration of the learning process.“During the demonstration, I focused intently on every detail of the teacher’s movements, taking note of how he addressed various situations and the precautions he emphasized throughout the procedure.”These observations not only enhanced my understanding of the IV infusion process but also provided me with a more intuitive grasp of the actual operation. Enhancing one’s practical skills, this process extends beyond mere proficiency and mastery of techniques. More importantly, it also cultivates decision-making abilities. CG19 indicates that during the pre-course preparatory phase, she acquired a foundational understanding of the theoretical knowledge and operational procedures related to IV infusion by viewing the video materials. However, this represents only the initial stage of learning, and the true challenge lies in the application of this knowledge in practical settings. The instructor’s live demonstration offered her a valuable example of how professionals implement this knowledge in practice, effectively addressing a variety of situations that may arise.

Regarding the challenges associated with adapting to new technology, some students expressed that when utilizing VR for training, immediate feedback is lacking in the event of an operational error. Feedback is only provided at the conclusion of the entire operational process, which diminished their motivation to learn. In contrast to the collaborative role-playing model employed in the experimental class, students in the control class relied on the traditional methods of teacher demonstration and self-practice. Student CG29 noted that while they enhanced their practical skills, they felt a deficiency in deep thinking and communication. Similarly, CG9 observed that self-practice often led to a mechanical repetition of steps. Furthermore, creativity would be hindered if the tasks are not connected to the students’ real-life experiences and learning needs. Consequently, students in the control group expressed a strong desire for increased group discussions. They advocated for the introduction of more real clinical cases to analyze and resolve problems in authentic situations, thereby fostering clinical critical thinking skills. Additionally, many students remarked that although the non-CRP VR-FL model improved their independent learning capabilities, they sometimes experienced heightened stress due to excessive study requirements prior to class. This was particularly true for those who did not complete the pre-class preview, as they struggled to keep pace during class, which could adversely affect their creativity.

The integration of CRP within VR-FL significantly enhanced nursing students’ academic performance and critical thinking skills. These findings align with broader evidence on simulation-based pedagogy [26]. For example, our results corroborate that role-playing in clinical simulations deepens knowledge application, as demonstrated in studies where students performing physical examinations through role-play showed superior procedural integration and problem-solving compared to traditional methods [27]. The immersive VR environment further amplified this effect by enabling repetitive practice in risk-free scenarios, consistent with research highlighting VR’s capacity to improve technical skill retention and clinical decision-making [28].

The marked improvement in critical thinking within our CRP-VR-FL group underscores the synergy between role-play and collaborative learning. By adopting roles (nurse, patient, family), students navigated clinical ambiguities through multi-perspective analysis—an outcome echoing systematic reviews confirming that role-play cultivates clinical judgment and adaptive reasoning [29]. Notably, teamwork dynamics in our intervention mirrored findings from Galindo [30] where role-play reduced resistance to student-centered learning and enhanced peer communication. This suggests CRP-VR-FL not only builds technical proficiency but also addresses core competencies in interprofessional collaboration.

Contrary to performance metrics, learning attitudes showed no significant intergroup difference. Both cohorts perceived VR as engaging and interactive, likely reflecting the inherent appeal of immersive technology itself rather than pedagogical design—a phenomenon noted in UbiSim’s survey, where 84% of nursing students rated VR simulations equal or superior to mannequin-based training [31]. Similarly, creativity gains were marginal. While CRP-VR-FL provided collaborative problem-solving opportunities, creativity in clinical contexts demands longitudinal development. This aligns with Bender-Salazar’s experiential learning theory [32], wherein iterative cycles of reflection and application (beyond a single intervention) are essential for innovative thinking. Short-term interventions, as in our study, may insufficiently disrupt entrenched cognitive patterns to foster measurable creativity shifts.

The study faced limitations related to time and resources, which resulted in the collection of a relatively small number of samples. Although the sample size was statistically representative, a larger sample could have provided more comprehensive and nuanced analytical outcomes. Additionally, the research primarily focused on a specific area of nursing education, thereby excluding other relevant domains. Furthermore, the duration of the experimental phase was restricted, as the teaching intervention was implemented over a single course, which may not adequately capture the long-term effects of the CRP-based VR-FL pedagogy on students’ learning outcomes. Although the content selection and activity format have been certified by experts, they have not been piloted in a small sample, which is one of the limitations of the study.

This research investigates the effectiveness of integrating the CRP-based VR-FL approach in nursing education through a comparative experiment. The experimental group utilized the hybrid learning methods of CRP-based VR-FL, while the control group employed traditional VR-FL. The results indicated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in terms of IV infusion knowledge acquisition, critical thinking (particularly decision-making ability), as well as learning interest, classroom participation, teamwork and independent learning skills. Research has demonstrated that the deep integration of CRP-based VR-FL approach can effectively enhance the multidimensional training in nursing education. This study demonstrates that educators should actively explore and integrate a variety of teaching methods to optimize instructional effectiveness. Furthermore, instructors can leverage modern technologies, such as VR, to create more immersive and interactive learning environments for students [33], thereby enhancing both the learning experience and its effectiveness. The results of the self-assessment indicated that the learning approaches significantly increased students’ interest in learning, engagement, teamwork, and independent study. This underscores the importance of encouraging students to engage in self-assessment throughout the teaching and learning process, allowing them to recognize their own learning status through reflection and feedback, and subsequently adjust their learning strategies to improve their effectiveness. Given the successful implementation of this study in nursing education, educators may consider extending this pedagogical approach, which integrates virtual FL and role-playing, to other educational fields to explore its applicability and effectiveness across various disciplinary contexts.

Future research should aim to collect a larger sample size to improve the generalization and robustness of the findings. Moreover, expanding the research to include a wider array of nursing courses and clinical scenarios would help validate the applicability of the CRP-based VR-FL approach. Investigating ways to optimize the interactivity and personalized features of the VR platform to better meet the diverse learning needs of students would also be advantageous. Lastly, conducting longitudinal studies to track students’ performance in clinical practice would provide valuable insights into the impact of this learning approach on their long-term career development, representing a significant direction for future research.
