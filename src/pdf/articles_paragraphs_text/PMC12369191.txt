Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by impairments in motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions. Despite advances in genomic sequencing, the genetic basis of many NDDs remains unexplored.CCDC82encodes a coiled-coil domain-containing protein with an unknown function in the nervous system. This study aims to further delineate the clinical spectrum ofCCDC82-related disorders by identifying a novel homozygous nonsense variant in an Iranian family with early-onset hypotonia, infantile spasms, and developmental delay.

An 8-month-old male proband of Turkmen descent, born to consanguineous parents, presented with severe hypotonia, spasticity, infantile spasms, and developmental delay. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a hypsarrhythmic pattern, and brain MRI showed no significant structural abnormalities. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband, followed by in silico pathogenicity analysis and segregation studies in the family. Sanger sequencing confirmed the variant, and bioinformatics tools assessed its potential impact.

WES identified a novel homozygous nonsense variant inCCDC82(NM_024725.4: c.709 C > T, p.Arg237Ter), which was classified as pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. This variant is predicted to result in nonsense-mediated decay. This variant was absent in population databases and segregated with the disease phenotype in the family. In silico analyses supported its deleterious effect, and evolutionary conservation studies indicated a conserved role ofCCDC82in neuronal function.

This study reports a novel pathogenic variant inCCDC82associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. These findings expand the known phenotypic spectrum associated with biallelicCCDC82variants, reinforcing its role in early-onset hypotonia and infantile spasms. Further investigations are necessary to confirm its functional role and establishCCDC82as a novel disease-associated gene.

Neurodevelopmental disorders encompass a broad spectrum of genetic conditions affecting brain function, often resulting in intellectual disability, epilepsy, and movement disorders. Among these, infantile spasms and hypotonia represent critical neurological manifestations in infancy. Infantile spasms, characterized by epileptic spasms typically occurring in clusters, and hypotonia refers to diminished muscle tone, both of which can signal underlying genetic or metabolic etiologies. The coexistence of these symptoms complicates diagnosis and treatment, frequently leading to severe developmental delays, epilepsy, and motor impairments. Although infantile spasms typically emerge within the first year of life and are associated with various syndromes, pinpointing a precise genetic cause remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of these disorders [1,2].

While various genetic mutations have been implicated in neonatal spasms and hypotonia, many of these are rare, and their associations with specific disorders are often not well established. Previous studies have highlighted several genetic loci linked to these conditions, including mutations in genes such asSTXBP1,CDKL5, andTBC1D24. However, the identification of novel genes and mutations remains a crucial aspect of advancing our understanding of these disorders. TheCCDC82gene, for instance, encodes a coiled-coil domain-containing protein and has been implicated in neuronal function. It is believed to play a role in maintaining synaptic integrity and regulating neuronal communication, although its exact biological function is not fully understood [3,4].

Advances in genomic research have significantly enhanced our understanding of rare neurodevelopmental disorders, yet many genetic contributors to neonatal spasms and hypotonia remain unidentified. The study of consanguineous families provides a unique opportunity to investigate autosomal recessive variants, as such families have an increased likelihood of harboring rare pathogenic mutations. Despite its potential role in neurodevelopment, biallelic variants inCCDC82have only recently been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and the full clinical spectrum is still being defined (OMIM #617482). Identifying additional pathogenic variants in this gene is crucial for providing new insights into its clinical significance and expanding our understanding of the molecular basis of these conditions [5].

This study highlights the critical role of whole-exome sequencing and segregation analysis in identifying novel genetic contributors to rare diseases. By characterizing a novelCCDC82variant in a family with infantile spasms and hypotonia, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation and provide further evidence for the role of coiled-coil domain-containing proteins in neurodevelopmental pathology. Further functional studies, including in vitro and in vivo models, will be essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlyingCCDC82dysfunction and its potential therapeutic implications.

The proband (individual V-1 in the pedigree) is an 8-month-old Iranian male infant of Turkmen descent. He is the first and only child of healthy, first-cousin parents (Fig.1). The family history was significant for a similarly affected paternal cousin (individual IV-1).

The proband was referred for neurological evaluation at 8 months of age for profound developmental delay and the recent onset of seizures. His seizures were the first epileptic events and were clinically and electroencephalographically consistent with Infantile Spasms Syndrome (per the 2017 ILAE classification). The spasms occurred in clusters, typically upon waking.

Gross Motor: He exhibited significant head lag, was unable to roll over, and could not sit, even with support.

Fine Motor: His hands were predominantly fisted, with no reaching for objects or raking grasp.

Social/Cognitive: He made poor eye contact, offered only a fleeting non-social smile, and was non-vocal.

Neurological examination showed severe, diffuse hypotonia with intermittent spasticity, more pronounced in the lower limbs. A thorough physical examination revealed no significant dysmorphic features.

The proband’s 12-year-old paternal cousin presented with a similar but more evolved, severe phenotype. He has profound intellectual disability, is non-verbal, and is wheelchair-bound due to severe spastic quadriparesis. His clinical history includes infantile spasms in his first year of life, which subsequently evolved into a Lennox-Gastaut-like syndrome with medically refractory seizures (tonic, atonic, and atypical absence).

Neuroimaging and EEG: The proband’s initial EEG showed a classic hypsarrhythmic pattern. His brain MRI at 8 months was interpreted as structurally normal for his age. In contrast, the affected cousin’s most recent brain MRI at age 10 showed mild, diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.

Metabolic Workup: A comprehensive metabolic workup for the proband, including serum lactate, ammonia, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids, yielded unremarkable results.

Treatment and Follow-up: The proband was treated with high-dose oral prednisolone followed by vigabatrin. This regimen resulted in only a transient reduction in spasm frequency without achieving clinical or EEG remission. At his last follow-up at 14 months of age, he continued to have refractory spasms and had not acquired any new developmental skills.

Peripheral blood samples were collected from the proband, parents, and the affected paternal cousin for genetic analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Yekta Tajhiz DNA extraction kit (Cat. No. FABGK001) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and concentration of the extracted DNA were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed exclusively on the proband (V-1) using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kit for target enrichment, followed by sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. An average sequencing depth of 100× was achieved, with ≥ 90% of bases covered at a depth of 20×. Raw sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, v0.7.5a). Post-alignment processing included duplicate read removal (Picard tools, v2.25), indel realignment and base quality recalibration (GATK, v4.1), variant calling (GATK HaplotypeCaller and Samtools), and variant annotation (ANNOVAR). Population databases, including dbSNP, gnomAD, the 1000 Genomes Project, and ClinVar, were used for filtering and prioritization. Given the consanguineous background of the proband, analysis focused on rare, potentially pathogenic homozygous variants in genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders [6].

The identified *CCDC82* c.709 C > T variant was further analyzed for segregation within the family to establish its potential role in the disorder. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed using primers specific to the *CCDC82* variant, followed by Sanger sequencing to validate its presence in the proband and test for its segregation in available family members, including the parents and the affected cousin. Chromatogram analysis was conducted using CodonCode Aligner software, confirming variant co-segregation with the disease phenotype.

The proband, an 8-month-old male of Turkmen descent, presented with severe hypotonia, spasticity, epilepsy, and infantile spasms. Neurological examination indicated significant developmental delay, characterized by poor head control and an inability to sit independently. Seizures were observed as sudden, brief contractions of the axial and limb muscles, occurring in clusters, which were consistent with infantile spasms. Electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated a hypsarrhythmic pattern, reinforcing the diagnosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any major structural abnormalities.

The patient was born to healthy, consanguineous parents, raising the possibility of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Family history revealed a 12-year-old paternal cousin exhibiting a similar clinical phenotype, including severe neurodevelopmental delay, persistent hypotonia, and epilepsy, further supporting the likelihood of a genetic etiology. No additional affected individuals were reported within the extended family.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel homozygous nonsense variant in theCCDC82gene:NM_024725.4: c.709 C > T, p.Arg237Ter. This variant introduces a premature termination codon (PTC) in exon 8 of 11. This PTC is located more than 55 nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction, and is therefore strongly predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the transcript, leading to a loss-of-function mechanism. The variant was absent in major population databases. The variant was absent in major population databases, including gnomAD, the 1000 Genomes Project, and ExAC. Additionally, it had not been previously reported in ClinVar or OMIM, suggesting its novelty and potential pathogenic significance.

Following a rigorous filtering strategy for rare (MAF < 0.01), homozygous, and predicted pathogenic variants, the identified CCDC82 variant was the sole candidate that fully explained the clinical phenotype and co-segregated with the disease in the family. No other variants in known neurodevelopmental genes met these criteria.

The variant was classified as “Pathogenic” according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines based on the following evidence: PVS1 (null variant in a gene where LoF is a known disease mechanism), PM2 (absent from controls in large population databases), PP1 (co-segregation with disease in multiple family members), and PP4 (phenotype is highly specific for the gene).

Furthermore, in silico analysis of evolutionary conservation indicated that the Arg237 residue is highly conserved across multiple species, suggesting its functional importance.

Sanger sequencing validated the presence of the CCDC82 c.709 C > T variant in the proband. Segregation analysis confirmed that both parents were heterozygous carriers of the variant The affected paternal cousin was also found to be homozygous for the mutation. The co-segregation of the mutation with the disease phenotype strongly supported its pathogenic role in the observed neurodevelopmental disorder (Fig.2).

This study identified a novel homozygous nonsense variant inCCDC82(NM_024725.4: c.709 C > T, p.Arg237Ter) in an Iranian consanguineous family affected by neonatal-onset hypotonia, epilepsy, and developmental delay. To date,CCDC82has not been extensively characterized in the context of human disease, and no specific disorder has been definitively linked to its mutations in major genetic databases. However, its functional domain structure and emerging reports suggest a possible role in neurodevelopment. The identification of this variant provides valuable insight into the genetic etiology of early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders and expands the spectrum of genes potentially implicated in neuronal dysfunction [7].

Genetic variations in coiled-coil domain-containing proteins have been implicated in intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders. Prior studies have demonstrated the impact of novel recessive mutations in such proteins on syndromic intellectual disability within consanguineous families, highlighting the role of rare genetic variants in these conditions [8]. Similarly, research on recessive intellectual disability in consanguineous populations has identified multiple novel genes, underscoring the genetic heterogeneity of these disorders [9]. The findings of this study align with these reports, as they provide further evidence of a CCDC82 nonsense mutation contributing to a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype.

Recent genetic studies further support the role of CCDC82 in neurodevelopment. A direct comparison with the case reported by Bauer et al. (2022) reveals both phenotypic overlap and potential differences. Similar to their patient, our two affected individuals exhibit severe intellectual disability and spasticity (evolving into spastic quadriparesis in the older cousin). However, a key distinction is the absence of the specific dysmorphic features (e.g., hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge) in our patients that were reported by Bauer et al. Furthermore, our proband presented with classic infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia, a core feature that helps to further delineate the clinical spectrum of CCDC82-related disorders [7]. The phenotypic similarities between that case and the proband in this study suggest a possible genotype-phenotype correlation, although additional cases are needed to confirm this relationship. Additionally, large-scale studies mapping autosomal recessive intellectual disability through microarray and whole-exome sequencing (WES) have identified numerous novel genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, emphasizing the importance of high-throughput sequencing in detecting rare pathogenic variants [10].

The pathogenicity of theCCDC82c.709 C > T variant is strongly supported by multiple lines of evidence. Bioinformatics tools classified the variant as deleterious, and conservation analysis indicated the functional importance of the affected Arg237 residue. The introduction of a premature stop codon suggests that nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) leads to complete loss ofCCDC82protein function, a mechanism frequently associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders. This mechanism is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the impact of loss-of-function mutations in neuronal genes identified through large-scale phosphoproteomics screens, where disruption of phosphorylation-dependent neuronal processes has been linked to cognitive impairments and neurodevelopmental abnormalities [11].

Further supporting its potential role in neurodevelopment, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data indicate CCDC82 expression in human neurons and glial cells [12]. Additionally, the identification of CG17233 as its ortholog in Drosophila, which also shows expression in the nervous system, provides evolutionary evidence for a conserved function in neuronal processes [13].

Despite these findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, critical functional validation of the CCDC82 variant was not performed in this study. Further research, including transcript analysis to confirm NMD and cellular assays, is required to definitively establish the pathogenic impact of the mutation. Second, while co-segregation analysis provides strong genetic evidence, the small sample size limits the generalizability of our findings. Additional affected individuals withCCDC82variants need to be identified to establish a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation. Third, the possibility of additional genetic modifiers or environmental factors influencing the severity of symptoms cannot be excluded. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and transcriptomic studies may provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotype.

In conclusion, this study reports a novel pathogenic homozygous nonsense mutation in CCDC82 associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in a consanguineous Iranian family. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence linking biallelic CCDC82 loss-of-function variants to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders and help to further delineate the associated clinical features, which in our case include early-onset hypotonia and Infantile Spasms Syndrome. The increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies will be instrumental in identifying additional cases and elucidating the broader implications of CCDC82 mutations in human disease.
