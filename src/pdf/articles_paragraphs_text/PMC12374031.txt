Swyer syndrome, a form of complete gonadal dysgenesis, is a rare genetic condition in which phenotypic females exhibit a 46,XY karyotype. A 15-year-old girl presented with underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics and amenorrhea. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels and low estradiol levels, while imaging identified a small uterus and gonads. Chromosomal analysis confirmed a 46,XY karyotype. The patient was treated with hormone replacement therapy, resulting in significant pubertal development, reaching Tanner stage 3 within 8 months. This case highlights the importance of early recognition, chromosomal analysis, and tailored management in Swyer syndrome. Multidisciplinary approaches based on hormonal therapy, fertility counseling, and psychological support are crucial to improving patient outcomes. As the first case report of Swyer syndrome in Syria, this study underscores the need for heightened clinical awareness of this rare condition and widens the differential diagnosis for primary amenorrhea.

The significantly elevated risk of malignancy in individuals with Swyer syndrome is of particular concern; the likelihood of developing gonadoblastoma ranges from 15% to 45% among patients without a familial history.5Here, we present the case of an adolescent girl with Swyer syndrome characterized by amenorrhea and the absence of secondary sexual characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of Swyer syndrome in Syria.

A 15-year-old girl was admitted to Homs University Hospital on 2 February 2025. Her aunt had brought her to the hospital owing to concerns about delayed development of secondary sexual characteristics. The patient had not yet experienced menarche as opposed to her peers. Physical examination confirmed Tanner stage 1. Other physical characteristics were unremarkable. Her height was 153.5 cm, and her weight was 39 kg; her calculated body mass index was 16.5, as per which she was classified in the underweight category. Her family history was significant for secondary hypogonadism in her sister. However, no documented medical history was available for her parents owing to the disruptions caused by war. Additionally, the patient did not express any psychological distress or social discomfort related to the absence of pubertal development.

Laboratory test results showed a serum estradiol level of 7.22 pg/mL and a follicle-stimulating hormone level of 117 mIU/mL. Ultrasound echocardiography revealed a clearly defined uterus with no masses or cysts. The uterus was normal in shape and position; the dimensions of the uterus were 17 × 13 × 10 mm. The endometrial cavity had collapsed, and no endometrial lining was present. The gonads were small, with no free fluid observed in the Douglas pouch (Figure 1).

Ultrasound findings: the uterus had well-defined borders and a homogeneous texture, with no visible masses or cysts and a thin endometrial lining. The gonads were normal in appearance and small in size, measuring 12 × 2.5 mm.

Infantile uterus and adnexa were observed on magnetic resonance imaging; her uterus was small, measuring 35 mm in length, 20 mm in width, and 11 mm in thickness. The endometrium was thin and regular. The gonads were slightly thin, consistent with a dysgenetic gonad structure, measuring 24 mm in length and 6 mm in thickness. They contained small follicular exchanges with a diameter <4 mm.

No pathological masses, cysts, or fluids were observed in the pelvic region (Figure 2). Karyotyping analysis showed a 46,XY chromosomal pattern, establishing the diagnosis of Swyer syndrome.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings: the uterus was located on the midline, and the endometrial lining was thin and regular. The gonads were slightly thin in appearance, with small follicular changes distinguishable within them. No masses or cysts were detected.

Treatment was initiated with oral conjugated estrogen in the form of tablets at a dosage of 0.625 mg daily for 6 months. Subsequently, the dosage was increased to 1.25 mg daily for 6 months. Gonadectomy was not discussed with the patient at this time.

Twelve months post-treatment, the patient exhibited significant development of secondary sexual characteristics, reaching Tanner stage 3. However, no visible changes occurred with respect to menarche, and the patient exhibited no changes in her voice. She did not report any acne. She was initiated on a cyclic regimen of oral conjugated estrogen in the form of tablets (2.5 mg daily for 20 days), followed by a 10-day drug-free period.

Interestingly, the patient’s sister also had secondary hypogonadism, which, upon evaluation, could not be directly linked to her sister’s condition of Swyer syndrome. However, owing to limited access to genetic testing, the underlying cause of secondary hypogonadism in the sibling remained uncertain. The absence of genetic studies in both cases limits our ability to further investigate potential genetic or familial links between the two conditions.

Additionally, the most significant long-term complication in individuals with Swyer syndrome is osteoporosis because streak gonads (undeveloped ovaries) do not produce hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen plays a crucial role in bone health and growth, and the lack of estrogen in patients with Swyer syndrome can lead to reduced bone density (osteopenia) and an increased risk of fractures, resulting in a condition known as osteoporosis. To prevent this, HRT is typically started during adolescence to help induce puberty, including breast development and menstruation, as well as prevent bone loss and osteoporosis.

This case highlights the importance of considering Swyer syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients with primary amenorrhea and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. A comprehensive management plan, including hormonal therapy and psychological support, is essential for the patient’s overall well-being. We emphasize the value of a multidisciplinary approach, highlighting the need for early diagnosis, proactive treatment, and complete patient care to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients with this rare condition.
