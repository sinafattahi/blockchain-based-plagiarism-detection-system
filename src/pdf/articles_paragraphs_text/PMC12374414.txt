Understanding the antibiotic resistance profile of the emerging pathogenCitrobacter telavivumS24 is important for clinical care, surveillance, and research.C. telavivumS24, a strain that exhibits resistance to both streptomycin and spectinomycin, was isolated from the soil at a broiler chicken farm. The strain was identified by whole-genome sequencing and average nucleotide identity analyses. Annotation of the resistance genes revealed that a novel aminoglycoside resistance gene, designatedant(3″)-Ic, is located on the chromosome ofC. telavivumS24. This gene exhibits 52% similarity with the previously functionally characterized resistance geneaadA23. It distinguishes itself fromant(3″)-Iaandant(3″)-Ibgenes, and represents an independent branch. Theant(3″)-Icgene is recognized as an inherent resistance gene ofC. telavivumwithin a conserved genetic environment. The product of theant(3″)-Icgene is the aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase ANT(3″)-Ic, which has a theoretical pI of 5.05 and a molecular mass of 29 kDa. ANT(3”)-Ic inactivates streptomycin and spectinomycin with theKmof 46.13 and 115.90 µM, respectively. The discovery of the novel antibiotic resistance geneant(3″)-Icand the functional characterization of ANT(3”)-Ic will facilitate more targeted surveillance and treatment strategies for preventing and controlling zoonotic pathogens of zoonotic diseases.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics play a crucial role in clinical treatment and agricultural breeding. However, in recent years, with the widespread use of antibiotics, the problem of bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics has become increasingly serious, posing a huge threat to public health and the breeding industry [5,6]. Therefore, in-depth research on newly emerging drug-resistant strains and the drug-resistant genes they carry has extremely practical significance. In the clinical setting, resistance to aminoglycosides is predominantly mediated by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs), which include aminoglycoside acetyltransferases (AACs), aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases (ANTs), and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs) [7]. ANTs inactivate aminoglycosides through adenylation, which transfers an AMP group from ATP to the aminoglycoside molecule, thereby obstructing its ability to bind with the bacterial ribosome [7].Based on their specificities for aminoglycoside modification, the ANT enzymes are divided into five classes: ANT(6), ANT(9), ANT(4'), ANT(2"), and ANT(3"), each targeting a different hydroxyl adenylation position. To date, ANT(3") enzymes are the most common type of ANT enzymes. They have two main subclasses, ANT(3")-Ia and ANT(3")-Ib, which confer resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin.

In this study, we characterized aC. telavivumisolate from a broiler chicken farm. A novel gene conferring resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, designatedant(3″)-Ic, was identified on its chromosome. This study focused on understanding the characteristics of the novel resistance geneant(3″)-Icand its impact on aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.

C. telavivumisolate S24 was retrieved from a soil sample sourced from a broiler chicken farm located at Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China (120°25′37.23″, 28°12′05.31″) in April 2015. The bacterial isolation was performed through a 10-fold serial dilution in sterile saline, followed by plating the dilutions on LB agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and incubation at 37 °C for 16 h. Single colonies were subsequently isolated and purified, from which S24 was selected for further study. Initial identification was performed by using a microorganism auto-analysis system (VITEK®2, BioMerieux, France), together with a comparative analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence against the GenBank database, using the BLAST program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). To further determine the species status of S24, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated using a web-based ANI calculator [8] (http://www.ezbiocloud.net/tools/ani). This was based on 11 distinct phylogenetic groups within the genusCitrobacter[9]. The strains and plasmids employed in this work are detailed in Supplementary Table S1.

Genomic DNA fromC. telavivumS24 was extracted using a Bacterial Genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Generay Biotech, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The whole genome ofC. telavivumS24 was sequenced using both the Illumina (HiSeq 2500, Illumina, California, USA) and PacBio (PacBioRSII, Pacific Biosciences, California, USA) platforms. The short reads from Illumina sequencing were assembled using the SKESA v2.4.0 [10]. The long reads from PacBio were assembled with Trycycler v0.5.1 [11] and Flye v2.9-b1768 [12]. The quality of the PacBio draft genome assembly was further improved with Pilon v1.24 by mapping the short reads from Illumina sequencing [13]. Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted by Prokka v1.14.6 [14]. Antibiotic resistance genes were annotated by Resistance Gene Identifier v6.0.3, based on the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) [15]. The promoter region of the antibiotic resistance gene was predicted using BPROM [16].

The source information of the 23 antibiotics is shown in Table S2. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics were determined using the standard agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar (Hangzhou Binhe Microorganism Reagent Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China) plates, following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI M100, 34th Edition, 2024,https://clsi.org/shop/standards/m100/) [17]. The interpretation of the susceptibility results adhered to the CLSI guidelines when applicable. In cases where these guidelines were unavailable, we referred to those provided by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).Escherichia coliATCC 25922 was used as the quality control strain.

To determine the gene function, theant(3″)-Icgene with its promoter region was amplified from the genomic DNA ofC. telavivumS24 by PCR using designed primers (Table S3). The amplified fragment was inserted into the cloning vector pUCP20 digested with EcoRI (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and HindIII (Takara, Shiga, Japan). For expression and purification of ANT(3″)-Ic, the open reading frame (ORF) of theant(3″)-Icgene was PCR-amplified using primers designed with XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites and an enterokinase (EK) cleavage site (Table S3). The amplified product was subsequently cloned into the His-tagged expression vector pColdI. The recombinant plasmids pUCP20-ant(3″)-Icand pColdI-ant(3″)-Icwere transformed intoE. coliDH5α andE. coliBL21, respectively, and the resulting transformantsE. coliDH5α/pUCP20-ant(3″)-IcandE. coliBL21/pColdI-ant(3″)-Icwere obtained.

The recombinant aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase ANT(3″)-Ic was overexpressed inE. coliBL21 after induction with 1 mM isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma, Missouri, USA) at 16 ℃ in LB medium (OXOID, Basingstoke, UK) for 16 h. The protein was further purified with BeyoGold™ His-tag Purification Resin (P2218, Beyotime, Shanghai, China), with a slight modification to the manufacturer’s instructions. Instead of using the standard elution buffer, different concentrations (50, 100, 200, 500 µM) of imidazole solution were used for ANT(3″)-Ic elution. An N-terminal His-tag was cleaved with enterokinase enzyme (Genscript, Nanjing, China) at 22 °C for different times (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 h) and removed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography with BeyoGold™ His-tag Purification Resin. ANT(3″)-Ic was detected by SDS-PAGE and the quantity of the protein was determined by BCA protein assay Kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China) with spectrophotometer at 562 nm.

ANT(3")-Ic activity was verified by the Kirby-Bauer disk susceptibility test withE. coliATCC 25922, following the CLSI guidelines (M100, 34th Edition, 2024) [17]. Antimicrobial susceptibility test discs (Beijing Tiantan Biological Products Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) containing 10 µg of streptomycin, 10 µg of spectinomycin, 10 µg of gentamycin, and 30 µg of kanamycin, were placed on each MH plate. After incubating 15 µg of ATP with ANT(3″)-Ic of different contents (0, 8, 16, and 32 µg) for 30 min, the mixture was dropped onto the antimicrobial susceptibility test discs. All plates were cultured at 37℃ for 18 h. The inhibition zone diameters were measured using a vernier caliper. Each experiment was performed in triplicate independently, and the data were presented as the mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’st-test with SPSS software version 23.0, with a significance level setting at p < 0.05.

For kinetic assays, the mixture for the ANT(3")-Ic enzymatic action incorporated 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM UDP-glucose, 0.2 mM glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.2 mM NADP, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 units/mL UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, 4 units phosphoglucomutase, 4 units glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 100 mM ATP, 1µg ANT(3")-Ic, and variable concentrations of aminoglycoside (0–800 µM) in a total volume of 0.2 mL [18]. The source information of the reagents is shown in Table S2. We monitored the generation of NADPH at a wavelength of 340 nm using a spectrophotometer (Synergy Neo2, BioTek, Vermont, USA).

The molecular weight, pI, and instability index of ANT(3″)-Ic were predicted using ProtParam [19]. The putative signal peptide and cleavage site of ANT(3″)-Ic were predicted by SignalP 5.0 [20]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA 11 [21] with neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis, and visualized with Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) v5 [22]. The percentage next to the branches of the tree was obtained from the bootstrap test with 1000 replicates. Multiple sequence alignment was conducted using the ESPript server [23].

Approximately 20-kb DNA fragments containingant(3″)-Ic-likegenes and their flanking regions were retrieved from the NCBI database and analyzed using BLAST + 2.12.0 [24] and visualized with Proksee [25]. The distribution of theant(3″)-Ic-like genes was analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis based onant(3″)-Ic-like genes was performed using MEGA 11 [21] with the neighbor-joining method.

The isolate S24 is preliminarily identified asCitrobacter sp.based on 16 S rRNA gene (PQ669673) homology analysis, and further ANI analysis ultimately confirmed it to beC. telavivum, a species proposed by Ribeiro et al. in 2020 [4]. The ANI value of S24 when compared to theC. telavivumstrain 6105T(CP045205.1) is 98.55% (Table1), exceeding the boundary (95%) for the definition of prokaryotic species [26]. Conversely, the ANIs ofC. telavivumS24, when compared with other species (such asC. farmeriGTC 1319 at 93.59%,C. rodentiumATCC 51459 at 84.65%,C. koseriTBCP-5362 at 83.54% andC. amalonaticusS1285 at 83.31%), were all below the species cut-off of 95% (Table1) [9].C. telavivumS24 has a higher genomic relatedness toC. farmeri, a clinically common pathogenic bacterium. These results clearly demonstrate the distinct genomic relationship ofC. telavivumS24 with variousCitrobacterspecies. The ANI values are presented in Table1.

C. telavivumS24 forms circular and smooth colonies on LB plates (Fig.1A). The whole genome ofC. telavivumS24 is a circular chromosome consisting of 5,099,022 bp and has an average GC content of 53.74%. The genome is predicted to have 4,688 coding sequences (CDSs), among which 3,638 are known proteins and 1,050 are hypothetical proteins. Additionally, there are 86 tRNA and 22 rRNA genes encoded in the genome (Fig.1B). Comparative genomic analysis shows that the genome ofC. telavivum6105 exhibits the highest similarity to the genome ofC. telavivumS24 (Fig.1B). UnlikeC. telavivum6105 and 6106 carrying two plasmids,C. telavivumS24 is free of plasmid [4].

A total of 35 antibiotic resistance genes were identified in the genome ofC. telavivumS24 with mostly efflux pump-related resistance genes (28/35, 80%), including resistance-nodulation-division (RND) antibiotic efflux pumps (15/28), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) antibiotic efflux pumps (9/28), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) antibiotic efflux pumps (3/28), and akdpEantibiotic efflux pump (1/28) (Fig.1C). The details of these genes are listed in Table S4.

C. telavivumS24 is susceptible to a wide range of tested antibiotics, which include β-lactams, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol derivatives, and tetracyclines, but it displays resistance to spectinomycin (MIC, 32 µg/mL), streptomycin (MIC, 64 µg/mL), fosfomycin (MIC, 64 µg/mL), and colistin (MIC, 256 µg/mL) (Table2). The specific resistance patterns ofC. telavivumS24 can be attributed to the presence of certain resistance genes. The fosfomycin and colistin resistance observed inC. telavivumS24 can presumably be attributed to the presence of the fosfomycin resistance genesglpTanduhpT[27], and the polymyxin resistance genepmrF, respectively [28] (Fig.1C). Interestingly, there is a high sequence similarityof96% forglpT, 99.43% foruhpT, and 99.90% forpmrFbetweenC. telavivumS24 andC. telavivum6105. However,C. telavivum6105 is susceptible to colistin and fosfomycin [4]. This phenomenon was also found in the putative β-lactamase geneblaSED.blaSEDshares 99.10% identity with theCitrobacter telavivumstrain 6105 class A beta-lactamase geneblaTEL(MN580933.1). Interestingly,blaSEDconfers resistance to various β-lactams, including ampicillin, temocillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime toC. telavivumstrain 6105. ButC. telavivumS24 is susceptible to these antibiotics. It could be that certain mutations or modifications in the bacterial genome have disrupted the normal function ofblaSEDin conferring resistance.

It should be noted thatC. telavivumS24 is resistant to both streptomycin and spectinomycin. However, no aminoglycoside resistance gene with ≥ 80% amino acid (aa) identity with the functionally characterized resistance gene has been annotated from the whole genome. To uncover the resistance mechanism, a putative aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase geneant(3″)-Icwith 52% similarity toaadA23was identified. The construction of pUCP20-ant(3″)-Icand colony PCR results were verified by 1% agarose gel (Fig. S1A, S1C). The recombinant strainE. coliDH5α/pUCP20-ant(3″)-Icshowed a high level of resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, with MICs of 64 and 512 µg/mL, respectively, indicating a 32-fold and 8-fold increase in resistance compared toE. coliDH5α/pUCP20. The high level of resistance exhibited by the recombinantE. coliDH5α/pUCP20-ant(3″)-Icsuggests a direct role of theant(3″)-Icgene in conferring resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. This could potentially be due to the specific enzymatic activity of the aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase ANT(3″)-Ic, which may modify the antibiotics and prevent their binding to target sites. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of action and determine whether other factors may also contribute to the observed resistance. In conclusion, we can infer that theant(3″)-Icgene confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin inC. telavivumS24.

ANT(3″)-Ic is 262 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 29 KDa and a theoretical pI of 5.05, and it notably lacks a signal peptide (Fig.2A). ANT(3”)-Ic is a stable protein with an instability index (II) of 38.84, exhibiting hydrophilic characteristics signified by a Grand Average of Hydropathicity (GRAVY) of −0.093 (Fig.2A). To determine the relatives of the putative aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase, BLAST analysis of ANT(3”)-Ic was carried out on the CARD and 39 sequences with known functions were listed in Table S5. The comparison results show that the amino acid sequence similarity of these proteins ranges from 27 to 52%, with the closest relationship with ANT(3”)-Ic being AadA23 (ARO:3002620) [29] and AadA22 (ARO:3002619) [30] reported inSalmonella enterica(Table S5). ANT(3″)-Ic exhibits the highest similarity of 52% to AadA23 among the function-characterized resistance proteins. To further evaluate the phylogenetic relationship, the phylogenetic tree was constructed with 30 sequences of ANT(3″) enzymes, including 25 of ANT(3″)-Ia, 1 of ANT(3″)-Ib, 3 of ANT(3″)-II (ANT(3″)-IIa, ANT(3″)-IIb, ANT(3″)-IIc) and the one of this work. The result suggested that ANT(3″)-Ic could be a new branch of the ANT(3″)-I family (Fig.2A), which inactivates streptomycin and spectinomycin by catalyzing the transfer of an AMP group from an ATP substrate [7]. ANT(3″)-I family currently includes ANT(3″)-Ia, ANT(3″)-Ib, and the newly discovered protein was thus designated ANT(3″)-Ic.

Despite evolutionary distinctions, all members of the ANT(3″) family, including ANT(3″)-I and ANT(3″)-II, exhibit adenylation activity on streptomycin and spectinomycin [31]. By comparing the amino acid sequences of the ANT(3″)-I and ANT(3″)-II subfamilies, ANT(3″)-Ic maintains consistency at many highly conserved active amino acid sites (Fig.2B). Notably, key amino acid sites such as S32, S42, D43, D45, E83, R188, K201, and Y227 are vital for ATP and ion binding; Q83, W108, and D178 are critical amino acid sites for binding with streptomycin and spectinomycin [31]. ANT(3″)-Ic exhibits high conservation at multiple active-site residues. Key sites S32, S42, D43, D45, E83, R188, K201, and Y227—critical for ATP and ion binding—are consistently preserved. Additionally, Q83, W108, and D178 represent essential residues for streptomycin and spectinomycin binding. Previous studies indicated that W169 and D174 are essential only for streptomycin resistance. The W169A mutant results in the 10-fold reduction in the MIC value for streptomycin. Multiple sequence alignment and the MIC result indicated that the W169I mutant may enhance the adenylation activity of ANT(3”) on streptomycin, for which evidence through varying MIC levels (ANT(3”)-Ic, 64 µg/mL; AadA (AAO49597.1), 128 µg/mL [32]; AadA36, (ON520657.1) 128 µg/mL [33]; AadA33 (ON520656), 256 µg/mL [34], ANT(3″)-IIa (EEX02086.1), > 1024 µg/mL [31]) has been recorded.

To elucidate its function inC. telavivumS24, we successfully expressed and purified the ANT(3″)-Ic using anE. coliexpression system and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig.3A Figure S1B, S1D). Standard inhibition zones were observed onE. coliATCC 25922 when tested with streptomycin, spectinomycin, kanamycin and gentamicin (Fig.3B). No inhibition zones were observed on the drug susceptibility discs of streptomycin and spectinomycin forC. telavivumS24 orE. coliDH5α/pUCP20-ant(3″)-Ic(Fig.3B). This phenomenon might be attributed to the fact that the protein encoded by theant(3″)-Icgene confers streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance onC. telavivumS24 andE. coliDH5α. To further verify the hydrolytic activity of the ANT(3″)-Ic on various antibiotics, different contents of purified ANT(3″)-Ic were incubated with ATCC 25922. The results show that ANT(3″)-Ic can directly confer resistance to gentamicin and spectinomycin onE. coliATCC 25922 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3D).

To further explore the hydrolysis mechanism of the enzyme in depth, enzymatic kinetic parameters were evaluated. Spectinomycin and streptomycin were hydrolyzed by ANT(3″)-Ic with aKmof 115.90 and 46.13 µM, respectively (Table3). The kinetic parameters indicate that the substrates of ANT(3″)-Ic are consistent with its MIC patterns.

Based on the whole genome sequence, theant(3″)-Icgene is located on the chromosome ofC. telavivumS24 (Fig.1). In order to understand the genetic environment of theant(3″)-Ic-like gene, a total of 21 bacterial genomes carryingant(3″)-Ic-like genes were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database. The approximately 20 kb flanking regions around theant(3″)-Ic-like genes are highly conserved. The metal-binding protein genezinT, universal stress protein geneuspF, transcriptional activatorampR, and a putative β-lactamase gene are located upstream of theant(3″)-Ic-like genes (Fig.4A). TheminC,minD, andminEgenes, which participate in cell division, are located downstream of theant(3″)-Ic-like genes (Fig.4A). No mobile genetic element was observed in the surrounding regions ofant(3″)-Ic-like genes (Fig.4A). The phylogenetic tree demonstrates thatant(3″)-Ic-likegene sequences form distinct monophyletic clusters within each species, while exhibiting significant divergence across different species. (Fig.4B). Based on the comparative and phylogenetic results, we speculate that theant(3″)-Ic-like genes are a group of inherent resistance genes of theCitrobactergenus.

Theant(3″)-Ic-like genes are exclusively distributed among different species of the genusCitrobacter, includingC. amalonaticus(11/12),C. farmeri(3/3),C. freundii(1/1),C. telavivum(1/1) andCitrobactersp. (5/8) (Fig.4C) [4,35–37]. The highest similarity (97.97%) ofant(3″)-Icis with that of the strainC. telavivum6105, followed by that ofC. farmeriCCRI-24,236 (90.37%), while the similarities of the remainingant(3″)-Ic-like genes were all around 88% (Fig.4A). However, the adenylation activity ofant(3″)-Ic-like genes to streptomycin and spectinomycin remains uncharacterized in previous reports. A total of 21 complete genomes carryingant(3″)-Ic-like genes have been documented across multiple geographic regions: the USA (5), United Kingdom (4), Germany (3), China (2), Switzerland (1), Canada (1), Australia (1), Israel (1), Thailand (1), and 2 strains with unrecorded origins (Fig.4D). Theant(3″)-Ic-like genes are distributed in different parts of the world, raising concerns about the resulting resistance issues.

In this study, we first characterized a novel ANT resistance gene,ant(3″)-Ic, located in the genome ofC. telavivumS24. Theant(3″)-Ic-encoded protein ANT(3″)-Ic can adenylate streptomycin and spectinomycin in a concentration-dependent manner. Theant(3″)-Icgene has significant sequence differences from previously discovered enzymes with the same function and has the highest similarity toaadA23, with a similarity rate of 52%. Theant(3″)-Ic-like genes distribute among 6 species ofCitrobacter, of whichC. freundiiis one of the predominant clinical pathogens. Based on its upstream and downstream structures, it can be speculated that bothant(3″)-Icandant(3″)-Ic-like genes are intrinsic resistance genes. Under the selective pressure of aminoglycoside antibiotics,Citrobacterstrains harbouring theant(3″)-Ic-like genes are positively selected and established in the antibiotic-rich environments.

This study systematically characterized theant(3″)-Icgene and established its fundamental functional properties. However, our preliminary investigations demonstrate substantial sequence and functional divergences among enzymes within the same functional family. For instance, AadA33 and AadA36, both belonging to the ANT(3″) family, display significant differences in catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity. Further explorations leveraging three-dimensional protein modeling, active site mutational analysis, and functional domain characterization could yield critical insights for rational drug design and therapeutic development.
