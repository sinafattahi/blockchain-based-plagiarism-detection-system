Amur pike (Esox reicherti) is endemic to the Heilongjiang River system in Northeast Asia. Serving as a top predator in its ecosystem, Amur pike carries substantial significance in ecological, economic, and cultural dimensions. Molecular studies have firmly established that Esociformes is the sister group of Salmoniformes. Notably, unlike Salmoniformes, Esociformes has not undergone genomic duplication. In this study, we reported a chromosome-level genome assembly of Amur pike, the size of which is 976.47 Mb with a contig N50 of 30.76 Mb. Using Hi-C interaction information, a total of 948.05 Mb (98.51%) of the assembled sequences was successfully anchored and ordered onto 25 pseudochromosomes, ranged from 22.85 Mb to 56.71 Mb. Further analysis identified 368.55 Mb of repetitive sequences and 25,824 protein-coding genes in the genome. Among them, 98.80% (25,515) of the genes were functionally annotated. This high-quality genome could be a valuable resource for future studies of Amur pike. Moreover, it lays a robust groundwork for comparative genomics involving pikes and salmonids.

Esoxis a genus of freshwater fish commonly known as pike or pickerel. It is the only extant genus in the family Esocidae of the order Esociformes1. Pikes are fierce predatory species, regarded as occupying the apex of the ecosystem’s food chain and playing a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance2. With their unique appearance and strong struggling ability, pikes have also become a popular target for human fishing and angling3. Amur pike (Esox reicherti) is endemic to the Heilongjiang River system, covering the northern part of Northeast China4,5. However, owing to factors like overfishing and habitat alterations, its resources have declined significantly6. In China, measures such as fishing moratoriums, habitat restoration, artificial breeding and stock enhancement have been initiated to protect and restore the resources of Amur pike.

Molecular evidences strongly supported that the order Esociformes and the order Salmoniformes are sister groups7,8. The later encompasses many fish groups familiar to the public, such as Salmon, trout, char, grayling, whitefish, and so on. Due to their important ecological and economic values, as well as rich morphological and life history diversities, salmonids are one of the most concerned, well studied fish groups9. After the divergence from the order Esociformes, the order Salmoniformes thought to be experienced a whole-genome duplication event, and underwent multiple rounds of rediploidization processes10. During this complex evolutionary process, large-scale rearrangements occurred in the genomes of the order Salmoniformes, leading to obvious differences in the karyotypes among different groups11–13. In contrast, the order Esociformes did not undergo further genome duplication events and have retained their ancestral karyotype. Consequently, they together serve as a model system for assessing the impacts of whole-genome duplication in the vertebrate evolution14,15.

Remarkable progress has been made in the genomics of salmonids in the last few decades10. However, the pace of genomic research on the order Esociformes is extremely slow. Within the order Esociformes, a chromosome-level genome is currently available only for the northern pike (Esox lucius). The distribution of northern pike almost encircles the entire Arctic region, spanning the high-latitude areas of Eurasia and extending all the way to North America. Previous studies have indicated that some populations of northern pike follow the ZW sex-determination system, while other populations appear to be more in line with environmental sex determination16,17. Almost all the salmonid species investigated to date are characterized by a male heterogametic sex-determination system18.

In this study, we combined the PacBio long-read sequencing, Illumina short-read sequencing, and Hi-C technology to construct a chromosome-level genome of the Amur pike. This high-quality genome provides valuable genetic resources for the protection and utilization of Amur pike, and serves as a crucial resource for understanding the evolutionary impacts of genome duplication and sex chromosome evolution in vertebrates through comparative genomics with salmonids.

An adult male Amur pike was collected from the Urxun river in Hulun Lake (48°57′16″N, 117°45′22″E), which is part of the broader Heilongjiang River system in northeastern China. Muscle tissue from this individual was sampled for genome sequencing, while multiple tissues were mixed for transcriptome sequencing. All samples were immediately frozen and subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen until use. All animal procedures adhered to the guidelines for animal care and use at the Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute (HRFRI), Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences (CAFS). High-quality genomic DNA was extracted from the muscle using the CTAB method for Illumina sequencing. The quality of the extracted DNA was evaluated through agarose gel electrophoresis and with a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The DNA was quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen, USA).

To estimate the genome size, heterozygosity level, and repeat content of the Amur pike genome, a short-read (350 bp) library was constructed and sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq. 6000 platform (Illumina, CA, USA). Raw data was processed using fastp19software with the parameters “-q 10 -u 50 -y -g -Y 10 -e 20 -l 100 -b 150 -B 150”. After filtering, 68.60 Gb of clean reads were utilized for estimating genome features. The K-mers (K = 21) were counted using Jellyfish20software, and the genome characteristics were calculated with Genomescope21software. The genome size of the Amur pike was estimated to be approximately 861.55 Mb, with a heterozygosity of 0.30% and repeat sequences accounting for 27.27% (Fig.1).

The k-mer distribution used to estimate the genome size of Amur pike (Esox reicherti). The distribution was determined based on the Jellyfish analysis using a k-mer size of 21.

The difference between the k-mer estimated genome size (861.55 Mb) and the final assembly size (976.47 Mb) can be attributed to the factor that K-mer analysis may underestimate genome size in the presence of highly repetitive sequences, which constitute 37.74% of our assembly.

Genomic DNA was fragmented into ~15 kb fragments using the Megaruptor®2. The SMRTbell library was constructed with the SMRTbell Express Template Prep kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s prescribed guidelines. Subsequently, the constructed SMRTbell libraries were sequenced on a PacBio Sequel II system (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA). As a consequence, a total of 28.9 Gb of PacBio CCS reads were generated for the ensuing genome assembly. The average read length of the subreads sequences was 18,897 bp, and the N50 length was 19,545 bp. High-accuracy CCS data were assembled using hifiasm (v 0.16)22software with the parameters “l = 2, n = 4”. The resulting genome length was approximately 976.47 Mb, consisting of 224 contigs, with a contig N50 of 30.76 Mb.

The Hi-C library was prepared following a previously reported procedure23. The librariy underwent quality control tests using a Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen, USA), an Agilent 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), and q-PCR. Subsequently, 150 bp paired-end (PE) sequencing of the Hi-C library was carried out on the Illumina NovaSeq. 6000 platform. In total, 94.54 Gb of Hi-C read data was obtained. For anchoring contigs, 316,337,296 clean read pairs were generated from the Hi-C library. These reads were mapped to the contig genome using BWA (bwa-0.7.17)24with default parameters, and 270,362,164 read pairs were unique mapped. Among them, 158,990,406 (58.81%) paired reads with mates mapped to different contigs were utilized for Hi-C associated scaffolding. Self-ligation, non-ligation, and other invalid reads were filtered out. Next, we employed the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method in Lachesis25to cluster the contigs. As a result, 155 (69.2%) contigs, with a total length of 962.35 Mb (98.55%), were successfully clustered into 25 groups (Table1and Fig.2). Lachesis was further used to order and orient these clustered contigs. Eventually, 71 contigs, with a combined length of 948.05 Mb (98.51%), were successfully ordered and oriented. Finally, we obtained a high-quality chromosomal-level assembly for Amur pike, with chromosomal lengths ranging from 22.85 Mb to 56.71 Mb (Table1and Fig.3).

Transposon elements (TEs) were identified through a combination of homology-based and de novo approaches. RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/)26was used to detect and classify repetitive sequences in the genome assembly. It can automatically run two de novo repeat-finding programs, namely RECON27and RepeatScout28. Subsequently, full-length long terminal repeat retrotransposons (fl-LTR-RTs) were identified using both LTRharvest (v1.5.9)29and LTR_finder (v2.8)29. Then, LTR_retriever30was employed to generate a high-quality intact fl-LTR-RTs set and a non-redundant LTR library. A non-redundant species-specific TE library was constructed by integrating the de novo TE sequences library mentioned above with the known Dfam (v3.5)31database. For homology search, RepeatMasker (v4.1.2)32was used to identify the known TEs of the Amur pike genome in the Repbase TE library. Tandem repeats were annotated by Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF 409)33and MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA v2.1)34. The results showed that the size of the genome’s repetitive sequences was 368.55 Mb, which accounted for 37.74% of the assembled genome. Among these repetitive sequences, transposon elements (TEs) constituted 29.03% of the genome size, while tandem repeat sequences accounted for 8.71% (Table2). The detailed results are presented in Table2.

Protein-coding genes in the genome assembly of Amur pike were predicted using a comprehensive strategy that combinesab initioprediction, homology-based searches, and transcriptome-assisted annotation. Forab initioprediction, Augustus (v3.2.3)35and SNAP (2013-11-29)36were utilized in our automated gene prediction pipeline. In the homology-based approach, the GeMoMa (v1.7)37software was employed, using reference gene models from five other species (Coregonus clupeaformis,Danio Rerio,Esox lucius,Oncorhynchus mykiss,Salmo salar). For transcriptome-assisted prediction, we conducted RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq on the total RNA extracted from ten tissues, including skin, heart, liver, fins, brain, spleen, kidneys, testis, muscles, and gills. The total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent. Subsequently, RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq. 6000 platform (Illumina, CA, USA) and the PacBio Sequel II platform (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA) respectively, following the protocols provided by the manufacturers. A total of 17.79 Gb of RNA-seq data and 64.59 Gb of clean Iso-Seq data were generated, and these data were then used for whole-genome protein-coding gene prediction. The RNA-seq data were mapped to the reference genome using Hisat (v2.1.0)38and assembled by Stringtie (v2.1.4)39. GeneMarkS-T (v5.1)40was used to predict genes based on the assembled transcripts. The PASA (v2.4.1)41software was used to predict genes based on the unigenes and full-length transcripts from the PacBio (ONT) sequencing assembled by Trinity (v2.11)42. Gene models obtained from these different approaches were combined using the EVM software (v1.1.1)43and updated by PASA (v2.4.1)41. Finally, 25,824 protein-coding genes with an average length of 17,504.83 bp were predicted in the assembled Amur pike genome (Table3).

Summary of the functional gene annotation of Amur pike (Esox reicherti).

Gene functions were inferred according to the best match of the alignments to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant proteins (NR)44, EggNOG45, KOG46, TrEMBL47, Gene Ontology (GO)48and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database49using diamond blastp (diamond v2.0.4.142)50with an E-value threshold of 1E-5. The motifs and domains within gene models were identified by PFAM databases51. In total, 25,515 (about 98.8%) of the predicted protein-coding genes of Amur pike could be functionally annotated with known genes, conserved domains, and Gene Ontology terms (Table4).

Five types of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) were identified in the genome of Amur pike, including microRNAs (miRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). The tRNAs were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE program (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/)52. For rRNA identification, we employed barrnap (v0.9)53with default parameters to identify the genes related to rRNA. Other types of ncRNAs were detected by alignment to Rfam database54using infernal (v1.1.3) software55. In total, 76,281 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were annotated, including 50,923 rRNAs, 20,722 tRNAs, 419 miRNAs, 3,644 snRNAs, and 573 snoRNAs. Previous research has demonstrated that theEsoxgenome exhibits extreme amplification of 5S rRNA genes, a phenomenon considered among the highest reported copy numbers of rRNA genes in the animal kingdom56. The quantification of rRNA genes in theEsox reichertigenome further corroborates this extreme amplification, solidifying its status as an exceptional case of rDNA proliferation in vertebrates.

We conducted comprehensive quality assessments of the assembled genome through multiple validation approaches. Remapping of Illumina paired-end clean reads and PacBio long reads to the assembled genome using BWA24and Minimap266yielded mapping rates of 99.32% and 99.75%, respectively, with their high mapping rates and relatively uniform coverage validating the good completeness of the obtained genome (Table5). The completeness of the assembled genome sequence was further assessed with Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO, v 5.2.2)67based on the actinopterygii_odb10 database67, which identified 3,480 (95.60%) complete orthologs, including 3,429 (94.20%) single-copy orthologs and 51 (1.40%) duplicated orthologs, as well as 23 (0.63%) fragmented orthologs (Table6), supporting the high quality of this assembly. Contamination screening using BlobTools v1.1.168revealed minimal contamination, with 99.54% of assembled sequences (972.0 MB) correctly classified as Chordata, confirming the high purity of our assembly. Sequence accuracy assessment using Merqury v1.369yielded a Quality Value (QV) score of 45.13, corresponding to an error rate of 3.0657 × 10−5, or approximately 1 error per 32,612 base pairs, indicating exceptionally high sequence accuracy. Merqury completeness analysis confirmed that 98.76% of k-mers from the WGS short reads were present in our final assembly, demonstrating excellent representation of the sequenced genome content with minimal sequence loss during the assembly process. Finally, gene annotation quality was assessed using BUSCO v5.2.2 with the actinopterygii database (3,640 conserved core genes), which showed that 98.54% of BUSCO genes were present in our predicted gene set, indicating high completeness of our gene annotation Fig.3.

Collinearity analysis were Performed with the reference genome of northern pike, which could serve as a means to verify the accuracy of genome assembly. Use diamond (v0.9.29.130)50to align the gene sequences of the two species and identify the pairs of similar genes (e < 1e−5, C score > 0.5). Then, JCVI70software was used to filter the C score and draw the collinearity graph. The genome of the Amur pike obtained in this study has a good collinear relationship with that of the northern pike (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_011004845.1/), which supports the high quality of the assembly and annotation of this genome (Fig.4).
