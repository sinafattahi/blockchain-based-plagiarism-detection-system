The emergence of MDRK. pneumoniaeposes a critical challenge in treating respiratory-associated pneumonia. Bacteriophages are promising antibiotic alternatives with unique features. This study aimed to isolate new bacteriophages from the hospital environment and investigate their therapeutic potential and mechanisms.

We employed plaque assays, transmission electron microscopy, and whole-genome sequencing to systematically characterize the biological properties, morphology, and genomic profiles of the phages in parallel. The bacteriostatic curve, biofilm staining quantification, and biofilm inhibition rate assay were employed to evaluate the in vitro lytic efficacy of the phage. More importantly, we established the murine pneumonia infection models through nasal instillation, assessed the therapeutic potential of the phage in vivo by observing pathological morphology via HE staining, detecting pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via qPCR and ELISA, and monitoring bacterial load changes in lung tissue through PCR analysis.

Phages vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4, taxonomically classified asSiphoviridae, demonstrated broad temperature (4–60 °C), pH (4–11) tolerance, chloroform resistance, latent periods of 40/35 min, and burst sizes of 340/126 PFU/cell. Both genomes contained circular dsDNA genomes (47,466 bp/50,036 bp) without virulence or antibiotic resistance genes. The bacterial concentration markedly decreased at 2 h post-treatment, reaching its biological nadir by 6 h. Concurrent biofilm assays demonstrated 80% biofilm inhibition and rapid bacterial clearance. In murine pneumonia models, both phage monotherapy and phage-antibiotic combinations significantly reduced bacterial loads compared with antibiotics alone (P< 0.05), concurrently attenuating inflammation (IL-1β/IL-6/TNF-a.P< 0.0001) and restoring alveolar architecture with reduced necrosis.

The phages vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4 demonstrated robust environmental adaptability. Its antibacterial effect is related to its specific biofilm dissolution performance in vivo and in vitro. These findings provide strong evidence for the precise phage treatment of MDRK. pneumoniaeinfections.

Klebsiella pneumoniae(K. pneumoniae), a gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium encapsulated by a polysaccharide-rich layer, is a prominent opportunistic pathogen in clinical settings. On standard agar media, it forms distinctive mucoid, gray-white colonies [1].K. pneumoniaepredominantly colonizes the respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts, with a propensity to cause biofilm-associated pneumonia and systemic infections, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [2]. As the second most prevalent nosocomial pathogen, it trails onlyEscherichia coliin global healthcare-associated infection burden [3]. Alarmingly, escalating antimicrobial misuse has driven the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- producing and carbapenem-resistant hypervirulentK. pneumoniae(CR-hvKp), which severely compromise therapeutic efficacy and increase mortality [4]. This crisis underscores the need for non-antibiotic strategies to combatK. pneumoniaeinfections [5].

Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that specifically lyse bacterial hosts, represent a promising alternative. Phages are ubiquitous in diverse ecosystems, ranging from the soil to the mammalian microbiota, and constitute the Earth’s most abundant biological entities [6]. Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, phages exhibit species- specific bactericidal activity while preserving the commensal flora, minimizing collateral dysbiosis [7]. Their self-amplifying nature enables dose-efficient biofilm penetration and sustained therapeutic action [8], with emerging evidence supporting synergistic effects when combined with subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations [9]. Additionally, phage-derived enzymes degrade extracellular polymeric matrices, enhancing pathogen clearance [10]. Cost-effective large-scale production further positions phage therapy as a viable solution for antibiotic-allergic patients and MDR infection management [11]. Preclinical studies have validated phage efficacy against drug-resistant infections, with animal models showing significant survival improvement in pneumonia and sepsis scenarios [12]. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of phage-based interventions. However, clinical translation necessitates systematic characterization of phage diversity through curated repositories, which enable rapid host range matching and resistance monitoring [13]. However, our research provides novel insights into the prevention and control of hv-MDRK. pneumoniae.

In this study, two novel lytic phages vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4 were respectively isolated using the K3 and K57 serotype hvKP from hospital sewage, and their biology and genomic characteristics were determined. Both phages demonstrated potent lytic activity against MDRK. pneumoniaestrains in vivo, significantly attenuating pulmonary inflammation progression and improving survival rates in murine pneumonia models. Notably, the combined use of bacteriophage vB_KpnP_XY3 and gentamicin can significantly enhance the antibacterial effect of gentamicin. These findings collectively suggest that both phages represent promising candidates for future antimicrobial therapeutics targeting critical priority pathogens.

Sixty-six clinical bacterial strains were isolated from clinical specimens in the hospital laboratory and initially cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (Saiguo, Guangzhou) at 37 °C for 16 h. For liquid culture, single colonies were inoculated into LB broth (tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L, NaCl 10 g/L. pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The bacterial stocks were preserved at − 80 °C with 50% glycerol.

Two lytic phages (designated vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4) were isolated from hospital sewage samples collected in Xiangyang City via the double-layer agar plate method [14]. To ensure phage purity, phage plaques were subjected to three successive rounds of purification until achieving plaques of uniform size and morphology. The purified phage suspension was then filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane filter (Biosharp, Beijing) and stored at 4 °C for future use. Plaque morphology was analyzed under controlled culture conditions (37 °C, LB medium) with petri dishes (Biosharp, Beijing) and phage particles were purified for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Host specificity was evaluated through spot titration assays against a panel of clinically relevant bacterial strains.

Phage genomic DNA was extracted from purified lysates via a commercial viral genome extraction kit (Tiangen, Beijing). Whole-genome sequencing was performed via the Illumina next-generation sequencing platform (Jinweizhi, Suzhou). Contigs were assembled de novo via SnapGene software, followed by functional annotation of open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic relationships were inferred through maximum likelihood analysis in MEGA 11.0, with bootstrap values calculated from 1,000 replicates [15].

Thermal and pH stability profiles were determined by incubating phage suspensions at temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 70 °C and in LB medium adjusted to pH 2–12 [16]. Phage suspensions were mixed with chloroform at volume ratios of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1, followed by co-incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Viral titers were quantified via plaque-forming unit (PFU) assays. The optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined by co-cultivating phages with mid-log phase host bacteria at ratios of 0.001-100 PFU/CFU, followed by 0.22 μm membrane filtration after 6 h [17,18]. One-step growth curves were generated by synchronizing phage-host adsorption and sampling at 10-minute intervals over 120 min for titer quantification [19].

Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from the log-phase bacterial culture via a commercial viral genome extraction kit (Tiangen, Wuhan). Whole-genome sequencing was performed via the Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platform (Jinweizhi, Suzhou). Complete sequence assembly by Unicycler. Used Prokka (https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) for encoding gene prediction and utilized the VFDB (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/main.htm) database to annotate the virulence factors of this bacterium. And utilized the Drug Resistance Genes database (CARD) (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/main.htm) database to annotate the antibiotic resistance genes and resistance mechanisms of this bacterium.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of the host strains Kpn32416 and Kpn31109 to six distinct antibiotics, including meropenem (Yuanye, Shanghai), polymyxin E (Yuanye, Shanghai), cefoxitin (Aladdin, Shanghai), amikacin (Ron, Beijing), levofloxacin (Aladdin, Shanghai) and aztreonam (Aladdin, Shanghai), was evaluated via the broth microdilution method [20]. A standardized broth microdilution assay was conducted in 96-well plates. Wells B2-B12 were loaded with 100 µL of MHB. Well B2 received 100 µL of antibiotic stock (2000 µg/mL), vortex-mixed, and then serially diluted (1:2) through well B12 by transferring 100 µL sequentially. This generated 11 two-fold concentrations (1000–0.98 µg/mL) for MIC determination. Concurrently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes carried by the host strain. Genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial isolates via the Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen, Wuhan). Specific primers targeting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence-associated genes were designed following reference sequences and were commercially synthesized (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai). PCR amplification was conducted in a 20 µL reaction mixture containing 1 µL of DNA template, 0.5 µL each of forward and reverse primers (10 µM), 10 µL of Premix Taq (TaKaRa Premix Taq Version 2.0), and 8 µL of sterile ddH₂O. The thermal cycling parameters included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), with a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified products were resolved via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (120 V, 30 min) and visualized under UV illumination via a gel documentation system. The purified PCR products were sent to Shanghai Sangon Company (China) for sequencing, and BLAST homology analysis was conducted on the NCBI website (NCBI:http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Mid-log phase host bacteria (10⁸ CFU/mL) were treated with phage suspensions at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) ratios of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001. LB medium served as the control [21]. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with agitation (200 rpm), and bacterial growth was monitored via optical density (OD600) measurements at 1-hour intervals over 6 h.

For biofilm inhibition assays, phage lysates (10⁹ PFU/mL) were co-cultured with host bacteria (10⁸ CFU/mL) in 96-well plates at MOIs of 10–0.001, with triplicate biological replicates per condition. The negative controls contained SM buffer-treated bacterial suspensions, whereas the blank wells contained sterile LB medium. Following incubation at 37 °C (6–48 h), the biofilms were washed with PBS, fixed with 10% methanol for 15 min, and stained with 1% crystal violet (5 min). After being destained with deionized water, the biofilm biomass was quantified by solubilizing the retained dye in 33% glacial acetic acid and measuring the OD570 [22]. The inhibition rate was calculated as follows: Biofilm inhibition (%) = [1 - (OD570(test) / OD570(negative control))] × 100 [23].

Bacterial log-phase cultures (100 µL) were co-incubated with equal volumes of phage suspension, antibiotic (gentamicin, levofloxacin, and amikacin), or their combination in 96-well plates. After 16 h of incubation (37 °C), growth kinetics were quantified via OD600 measurements to evaluate the impact of phages on the antibacterial effects of antibiotics.

A murine pneumonia model (7–8 weeks old) (China Three Gorges University, Hubei) was established via intranasal inoculation of theK. pneumoniaestrain Kpn32416 (2 × 10⁸ CFU/mouse) following established protocols [24–26].The mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n= 3/group): blank control: intranasal saline. infection control: intranasal Kpn32416 (2 × 10⁸ CFU) [25]. phage control: intranasal saline + phage cocktail (2 × 10⁹ PFU). vB_KpnP_XY3 therapy: Kpn32416 infection + vB_KpnP_XY3 (2 × 10⁹ PFU). gentamicin therapy: Kpn32416 infection + gentamicin (10 mg/kg). phage cocktail therapy: Kpn32416 infection + phage cocktail (2 × 10⁹ PFU). combination therapy: Kpn32416 infection + vB_KpnP_XY3 (2 × 10⁹ PFU) + gentamicin [27]. At 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post infection, the mice were euthanized for tissue collection. Serum cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) via peripheral blood collected at 24 and 48 h post infection. Concurrently, cytokine mRNA expression in lung tissues was analyzed via qPCR at 48 h [28]. For histopathology, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm), and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) [29].

All experiments were independently repeated at least 3 times, and the results are presented as the means ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons among different groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Two lytic phages were deposited in the China Typical Culture Collection: vB_KpnP_XY3 (Accession: CCTCC M 2025022) was propagated onKlebsiella pneumoniaKpn32416, and vB_KpnP_XY4 (Accession: CCTCC M 2025094) was amplified from the strain Kpn31109. Plaque morphology analysis revealed uniform lytic zones with translucent halos (Fig.1A-B), indicating the potential depolymerase activity. TEM confirmed that both phages belong to theSiphoviridaefamily, and exhibit icosahedral heads (Fig.1C-D). Host range screening against 66 clinical isolates revealed lytic activity against two additional CR-hvKp strains (TableS1).

WGS revealed that both phages possess double-stranded circular DNA genomes. vB_KpnP_XY3 has 47,466 base pairs (bp) with a GC content of 48.05% and encodes 67 open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig.1E). vB_KpnP_XY4 has 50,036 bp with a GC content of 50.75% and contains 74 ORFs (Fig.1F). Notably, no virulence or antibiotic resistance genes were detected in either genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that vB_KpnP_XY3 was closely related to theK. pneumoniaephage VLCpiS13c (Fig.1G) and that vB_KpnP_XY4 was closely related to theK. pneumoniaephage LF20 (Fig.1H). Bioinformatics analysis of vB_KpnP_XY3’s genome predicted an endolysin containing a glycoside hydrolase family 24 (GH24) domain, known to hydrolyze (1–4)-beta-linkages in peptidoglycan and chitodextrins. We speculate that vB_KpnP_XY3’s potent lysis may involve a holin-endolysin system degrading the host peptidoglycan to release progeny virions (Fig.S1).

To determine the optimal MOI,K. pneumoniaecultures were infected with various phage concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Phage titers were quantified via the double-layer agar plate method. The peak titer for vB_KpnP_XY3 was 3.1 × 10^10 PFU/mL at an MOI of 0.1 (Fig.2A), whereas vB_KpnP_XY4 achieved a peak titer of 4.4 × 10^10 PFU/mL at an MOI of 0.01 (Fig.2B). Both phages demonstrated stability across a temperature range of 4–60 °C (Fig.2C-D) and a pH range of 4–11 (Fig.2E-F), and exhibited resistance to chloroform (Fig.2G-H). These properties highlight their potential for transportation, storage, and therapeutic applications. One-step growth curve analysis revealed that vB_KpnP_XY3 had a latent period of 20 min, and a burst duration of 40 min, and reached a plateau phase after 60 min, with a maximum titer of 2.7 × 10^11 PFU/mL and an average burst size of 340 PFU/cell (Fig.2I). In contrast, vB_KpnP_XY4 presented a shorter latent period of 5 min, a burst duration of 35 min, and a plateau phase after 40 min, resulting in a maximum titer of 1.4 × 10^10 PFU/mL and an average burst size of 126 PFU/cell (Fig.2J). These data demonstrate that both phages achieve rapid amplification with high lytic efficiency, positioning them as viable candidates for therapeutic deployment.

WGS revealed that Kpn32416 possess double-stranded circular DNA genomes. Kpn32416 has 5,701,765 bp with the GC content of 57.11% and encodes 14,344 open ORFs (Fig.3A). The functional annotation is primarily conducted from three perspectives: metabolism, cellular processing and signaling, and information storage and processing(Fig.3A). The drug resistance gene profiling indicates that this strain simultaneously carries resistance genes targeting various classes of antibiotics, including macrolide resistance genesermB,mefA/E,msrA/D, tetracycline resistance genestetA/B, streptomycin resistance genesstrAandstrB, cephalosporin resistance genesblaSHVandblaTEM, and polymyxin resistance genes. Consequently, Kpn32416 is almost resistant to all types of antibiotics (Fig.3B). The virulence gene analysis revealed that Kpn32416 carries a remarkably rich repertoire of virulence factors. This strain not only encodes key components including outer membrane protein A (OmpA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and capsular polysaccharide (CPS), but also possesses a biofilm-promoting gene cluster, the critical regulatory factorrmpA(which governs the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides for mucoid colony formation), as well asybtAandallSinvolved in the iron acquisition system (Fig.3C). The convergence of hv-MDR traits in this strain represents one of the most challenging pathogen types for current clinical anti-infective therapy.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed MDR in Kpn32416 and Kpn31109, with both strains exhibiting sustained growth even at the maximum tested antibiotic concentration (2000 µg/mL) (Fig.4A, B). Notably, meropenem demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibitory effects against Kpn32416, whereas polymyxin E showed similar dose-responsive activity against Kpn31109. However, neither agent achieved complete bacterial eradication despite displaying relatively superior efficacy compared with the other antibiotics tested. Genotypic characterization confirmed multidrug resistance and hypervirulent phenotypes in both clinical isolates. Strain Kpn32416 (serotype K3) (Fig.4C) harbored β-lactamase genes (blaTEM,blaSHV) and polymyxin resistance determinants (phoQ,pmrB) (Fig.4D) [30], whereas virulence factors, including the polysaccharide synthesis regulatorrmpA,ironacquisition systems (kfuBC,ybtA,iroNB), and adhesion-related genes (fimH,ureA) alongside LPS biosynthesis components (uge,wabG) (Fig.4E), were identified. The K57-type strain (Fig.4F) Kpn31109 exhibited broader resistance profiles with the additional carbapenemase geneblaKPC[31] and the chloramphenicol resistance geneCat1, while maintaining polymyxin resistance loci (Fig.4G). Its virulence arsenal has extended to include the aerobactin synthesis geneiucA, alongside conserved iron acquisition systems and surface structure determinants shared with Kpn32416 (Fig.4H) [32]. Both carbapenem-resistant strains demonstrated convergence of extended antimicrobial resistance and multiple virulence mechanisms, highlighting the therapeutic potential of phages vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4 against these CR-hvKp strains.

The bacterial concentrations in the PBS-treated control group increased over time, and all phage-treated groups exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial density after 2 h of co-incubation (Fig.5A, B). To assess the potential for phage resistance, KPs were co-cultured with individual phages (vB_KpnP_XY3, vB_KpnP_XY4) and a phage cocktail. The bacterial concentrations in all the treatment groups decreased after 2 h, with no evidence of phage-resistant bacterial growth over extended incubation periods (Fig.5G, H). These results suggest that these phages have potential applications in antimicrobial technology development and ecological remediation.

The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, which is composed of lipopolysaccharides, provides an additional barrier that complicates antibiotic treatment [33]. Biofilms critically contribute to severe infections by colonizing biological surfaces and medical implants. Their protective matrix confers 10–1000-fold greater antibiotic resistance than planktonic cells through enhanced penetration barriers, as evidenced clinically [34–37]. To investigate the biofilm-degrading potential of vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4, biofilm staining and inhibition assays were performed [38]. Both phages effectively inhibited biofilm formation, with vB_KpnP_XY4 achieving a 60% inhibition rate at 6 h and nearly 90% at 48 h (Fig.5C, D). Compared with the control conditions, quantitative biofilm staining confirmed that phages at different MOIs significantly degraded biofilms (Fig.5E, F).

In vitroantimicrobial assays demonstrated that, compared with antibiotic treatment, phage vB_KpnP_XY3 monotherapy achieved superior bacterial growth suppression (P< 0.0001). While gentamicin exhibited measurable antibacterial activity, its efficacy remained significantly lower than that of phage treatment (P< 0.0001). Notably, combination therapy with phage and antibiotics produced enhanced bactericidal effects that significantly surpassed those observed in the antibiotic-only groups (P< 0.0001), indicating a marked synergistic interaction between phage and antimicrobial agents (Fig.5I). These findings suggest that combining phages with antibiotics could enhance the treatment of MDR bacterial infections.

To establish temporal parameters forK. pneumoniaeKpn32416-induced pneumonia and define the therapeutic window for phage intervention, we utilized C57BL/6J murine model of pneumonitis [39]. Pulmonary infection was induced via nasopharyngeal instillation of 2 × 108CFU/mL Kpn32416, followed by intranasal administration of 1 × 109PFU/mL phage vB_KpnP_XY3 at 6 h post infection (Fig.6A). Longitudinal analyses of retro-orbital blood samples and pulmonary tissues were conducted at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h to evaluate inflammatory cytokine level (ELISA) and histopathological progression (H&E staining).

Untreated mice exhibited initial mortality at 48 h post infection, whereas phage monotherapy or phage cocktail treatment significantly improved survival outcomes. Concurrently, the serum inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) level was progressively lower in the phage-treated groups than in the untreated control groups (Fig.6B), confirming the time-dependent therapeutic efficacy of the phage. Histopathological evaluation revealed progressive inflammatory damage in untreated mice: mild vascular congestion and neutrophilic infiltration at 6 h post infection, peribronchiolar lymphocyte infiltration with inflammatory exudates at 12 h post infection, severe vascular congestion/ thrombosis at 24 h post infection, and extensive alveolar/bronchial epithelial necrosis with neutrophilic/ lymphocytic infiltration by 48 h post infection. In contrast, phage-treated mice exhibited marked histopathological improvement at 48 h post infection, characterized by restored alveolar architecture, attenuated tissue necrosis, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig.6C).

To evaluate the therapeutic advantages of phage therapy over traditional antibiotics, we conductedin vivoexperiments in additional cohorts, including gentamicin monotherapy, phage-antibiotic combination therapy, and phage cocktail groups (Fig.7A). Histopathological analysis at 48 h post infection revealed distinct outcomes: untreated controls: severe alveolar necrosis, erythrocyte sludge, and dense inflammatory infiltration. phage monotherapy/cocktail groups: near-normal pulmonary morphology with minimal inflammatory cells. phage-antibiotic combination groups: partial lung tissue restoration and localized inflammation. and gentamicin monotherapy groups: persistent alveolar disruption, eosinophilic exudates, and elevated cytokine infiltration (Fig.7B).

qPCR analysis of lung tissues at 48 h post infection corroborated these findings. While untreated mice showed > 4-fold upregulation of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α mRNA (P< 0.0001 vs. controls), the cytokine expression in the phage-treated groups was restored to near-normal levels (Fig.8A–C). In contrast, gentamicin monotherapy failed to suppress TNF-α transcription (P< 0.05 vs. phage groups. Figure8C). Quantitative cytokine profiling demonstrated significant difference in inflammatory regulation: At 24 h post infection, the mice exhibited a nearly 10-fold increase in serum inflammatory cytokine concentrations compared with those in the normal control group (P< 0.0001. Figure8D-F). Therapeutic intervention with phage vB_KpnP_XY3 monotherapy, phage cocktail therapy, or phage-antibiotic combination therapy significantly attenuated cytokine levels (P< 0.0001 vs. controls. Figure8D-I). Notably, both the phage-treated and combination therapy groups achieved near-normalization of inflammatory cytokine concentrations, demonstrating a statistically superior reduction compared with the antibiotic monotherapy group (P< 0.05. Figure8G-I), suggesting antibiotic-induced immune dysregulation.

These data establish 6 h post infection as the optimal therapeutic window for phage intervention in this pneumonia model. Phage monotherapy and cocktails demonstrated superior efficacy over gentamicin in terms of bacterial clearance, histopathological recovery, and inflammatory modulation, with synergistic effects observed with phage-antibiotic combinations. The time-dependent lytic activity of the phages correlated directly with the attenuation of both local and systemic inflammatory cascades, highlighting their potential as precision antimicrobial agents.

To confirm thatK. pneumoniaeKpn32416 is the causative agent and track its pulmonary dynamics, we performed PCR analysis targeting the conserved 16 S rRNA gene (universal bacterial marker) and theKp-khegene (species-specific virulence factor). Both genes were robustly detected in the lung tissues of untreated infected mice at all time points (6–48 h post infection), confirming successful colonization by Kpn32416 (Fig.9A-B). In contrast, the phage-treated groups exhibited nearly complete suppression ofKp-kheexpression by 24–48 h post infection (vs. the untreated group), with undetectable levels at 48 h post infection, indicating rapid phage-mediated bacterial clearance (Fig.9A). This elimination correlated temporally with histopathological recovery.

Histopathological analysis via H&E staining revealed no evidence of phage-induced off-target toxicity in major organs [40]. In liver tissues, the phage-treated groups (monotherapy, cocktail, and combination therapy) presented preserved hepatic architecture, with intact central veins, hepatocyte cords, and portal triads comparable to those of the untreated controls (Fig.10). Splenic samples presented normal white pulp/red pulp ratios across all treatment cohorts (Fig.10). Renal histology revealed no pathological alterations, with glomerular filtration barriers and proximal/distal tubule epithelia maintaining [28]structural integrity (Fig.10). These findings demonstrate the organ-specific safety profile of phage-based therapies, even at supraphysiological doses (1 × 10⁹ PFU/g tissue).

K. pneumoniaeremains a critical pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections ranging from bronchopneumonia to systemic disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [41]. The global spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, especially carbapenem-resistantK. pneumoniae(CRKP), presents an urgent therapeutic challenge due to their resistance to nearly all available antibiotics [42]. Phages represent a promising intervention strategy, offering advantages such as strain specificity, minimal disruption to the gut microbiota, and lower development costs [7]. Consequently, the discovery of novel phages, expansion of phage libraries, evaluation of preclinical efficacy, and investigation of phage-host interaction mechanisms are of significant importance [43,44].

However, recent reports onK. pneumoniaephages have primarily focused on their biological and genomic characteristics [41–43]. Research on clinical phage therapy applications is limited, and the mechanisms underlying phage action against bacteria require deeper exploration. This study isolated two novel lytic phages, vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4, from hospital sewage. Through comprehensive evaluation of their biological properties, in vitro antibacterial activity, biofilm eradication capability, synergistic effects with antibiotics, and validation in an animal model, we assessed their clinical potential. Our findings demonstrate that these phages efficiently lyse clinically relevant hv-MDR strains and mitigate lung tissue infection in mice.

Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the clinical epidemicK. pneumoniaeisolate Kpn32416 used in this study harbors an extensive repertoire of virulence factors and multidrug resistance genes. This strain encodes key OmpA, LPS, and CPS components—core determinants for bacterial adhesion, immune evasion, and serum resistance [44]. Notably, CPS is a major virulence factor forK. pneumoniaeand critically influences phage host specificity, adsorption efficiency, and bactericidal efficacy by serving as a key surface receptor. Additionally, the strain possesses gene clusters promoting biofilm formation (biofilm,rmpA) and efficient iron acquisition systems (ybtA,allS) [45]. More critically, it simultaneously carries resistance genes against nearly all major antibiotic classes, including macrolides, tetracyclines, streptomycins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides (Fig.3). The convergence of hv-MDR traits in this strain represents one of the most challenging pathogen types for current clinical anti-infective therapy [46]. Therefore, identifying phages capable of lysing such hv-MDR strains is paramount for treating Klebsiella infections.

Encouragingly, we isolated two highly lytic phages, vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4, using hv-MDR strains Kpn32416 and Kpn31109 as hosts. These phages exhibit desirable characteristics: short latent periods, large burst sizes, potent lytic activity, high environmental adaptability, and safety with no observed toxicity. However, they displayed activity against only 3 out of 66 tested strains, indicating a relatively narrow host range (TableS1). Despite this limitation, their efficient lytic activity against hv-MDRK. pneumoniaemotivates further investigation. Host range determination depends on specific interactions between the receptor-binding proteins (RBPs), particularly their C-terminal domains located on phage tail fibers or spikes, and complementary receptors exposed on the bacterial surface (e.g., capsule, flagella, LPS) [47]. The observed variation in host range among different phages stems from the diversity in RBP sequences. A narrow host range is an inherent characteristic of many virulent phages, resulting from precise recognition of specific host surface receptors [48]. This specificity confers unique advantages for targeted therapy (eliminating specific pathogens without disrupting commensal flora) and diagnostic tool development (highly specific biosensors). Furthermore, a limited host range provides an ideal model for studying “receptor-ligand” interactions.

Virulent phages hold significant promise for clinical therapy, especially against MDR infections. We validated the lytic capability and clinical potential of vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4 through crystal violet biofilm quantification and dynamic antibacterial monitoring. Results showed that both phages effectively inhibited host bacterial growth across various MOIs (10− 4–102) and significantly degraded mature biofilms (> 80% inhibition at 48 h), addressing the clinical challenge of antibiotic penetration into biofilm matrices. However, a limitation of this study is the lack of complementary methods for comprehensive biofilm assessment. Future research should incorporate techniques like confocal microscopy and viable plate counts to provide finer resolution on phage-induced effects on biofilm cell viability and spatial heterogeneity.

Phage resistance poses a common challenge in phage therapy and can lead to treatment failure. Studies suggest that using phage cocktails (≥ 2 phages targeting different molecular receptors) or combining phages with antibiotics can significantly suppress resistance emergence [49]. Our study found that combining vB_KpnP_XY3 with gentamicin, levofloxacin, or amikacin significantly enhanced growth inhibition of Kpn32416 compared to antibiotic monotherapy. This synergy may stem from phage-induced alterations in bacterial surface structures (polysaccharides, outer membrane proteins), thereby increasing antibiotic susceptibility [50]. However, combination therapy did not surpass the potent lytic effect of vB_KpnP_XY3 alone, likely due to its intrinsic high activity. Importantly, no phage resistance was observed for either phage alone or in combination during short-term exposure (< 4 days), highlighting their value for acute infection treatment.

We further evaluated the therapeutic potential of vB_KpnP_XY3 monotherapy, a phage cocktail, and its combination with antibiotics in a CR-hv-K. pneumoniaeinduced pneumonia model. While previous models used intraperitoneal or intranasal administration pre/post-infection, intraperitoneal delivery is non-standard and may elicit immune surveillance. Therefore, we adopted the more direct and efficient intranasal instillation method, delivering therapeutics directly to the target site. This approach achieves high local concentrations with lower systemic doses, potentially reducing side effects and shortening treatment duration [51]. Using this method, we established an acute, high-bacterial-load pneumonia model [26]. Studies confirm the efficacy and safety of phages in animal models for Klebsiella-induced pneumonia and enteritis [52,53]. Our results, integrating inflammatory cytokine levels, lung histopathology, and 16 S rRNA PCR analysis, corroborate this: vB_KpnP_XY3 treatment reduced bacterial load in mouse lung tissue, restored inflammatory responses to near-normal levels, and significantly improved lung pathology. However, it must be acknowledged that using 16 S rRNA PCR represents a significant limitation, as it cannot differentiate between live and dead bacteria. Future studies will prioritize colony-forming unit (CFU) counts or viability PCR for specific quantification of viable bacteria.

Gentamicin, recommended by the CDC for pneumonia, has poor lung penetration. However, studies suggest nebulization or intranasal instillation can enhance its pulmonary concentration [54]. We therefore evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of gentamicin combined with phage in our mouse model. Notably, antibiotic monotherapy was substantially less effective than phage monotherapy, the phage cocktail, or combination therapy. This finding contrasts with reports by David Gur et al. [55], suggesting differential immunomodulatory effects of various antimicrobial strategies. Future synergy assessments will also utilize checkerboard designs to quantify interactions and determine optimal concentration ratios, incorporating antibiotics with superior lung penetration.

Some phages produce translucent “halos” around plaques due to enzymatic degradation of bacterial exopolysaccharides, often indicating the presence of depolymerases [56]. These enzymes, typically featuring specific carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), bind host CPS and catalyze its degradation, serving as core weapons for breaching host defenses [57]. Depolymerase enzymes represent another promising candidate class for treating antibiotic-resistant infections [58]. Phages vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4 produce haloed plaques, eradicate biofilms, and exhibit potent lytic activity. We therefore hypothesize that these phages encode depolymerases, potentially contributing to their efficient lysis mechanism. Phage depolymerases usually comprise a catalytic domain and a structural domain, often containing specific motifs like Pectate_lyase_3, hydrolase, endosialidase, glycanase, or glycosidase [59]. Bioinformatics analysis of vB_KpnP_XY3’s genome predicted an endolysin containing a glycoside hydrolase family 24 (GH24) domain, known to hydrolyze (1->4)-beta-linkages in peptidoglycan and chitodextrins. We speculate that vB_KpnP_XY3’s potent lysis may involve a holin-endolysin system degrading the host peptidoglycan to release progeny virions. These findings are preliminary and warrant experimental validation. Future studies will focus on cloning, expressing, and purifying this endolysin to characterize its properties (stability, lytic spectrum, resistance induction) and evaluate its potential advantages over whole phage particles using in vitro antibacterial/biofilm assays and animal models.

The “co-evolutionary” dynamic between phages and host bacteria is complex, involving genomic adaptations. David Bikard’s team demonstrated that E. coli can block phage adsorption by altering OmpC conformation or secreting enzymes degrading phage binding sites [60]. Zhiwei Huang’s group showed CRISPR-Cas3 helicase/nuclease recruited to R-loops for spacer-directed DNA degradation [61]. Abortive infection mechanisms (toxin-antitoxin systems) can also terminate phage replication by inducing host suicide. In response, phages rapidly evolve counterstrategies: Adaptive mutations in RBPs (e.g., T7 phage evolving novel binding motifs via SPACE system or encoding anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit Cas complexes (e.g., Acr proteins binding the Cas7f “spine”) [61]. The core of phage-host interplay lies in the molecular mechanisms of receptor bifunctionality and CRISPR-Acr co-evolution. Future research should focus on the ecological significance of multi-receptor recognition strategies in heterogeneous environments like biofilms and leverage directed evolution technologies like SPACE to develop novel anti-pathogen tools. Notably, the two phages described in this study have so far exhibited no detectable phage resistance, which holds significant implications for the long-term phage therapy of drug-resistant bacterial infections. However, this observation might also be attributable to the short treatment period (< 5 days) or the limited number of passages. In subsequent studies investigating phage resistance mechanisms, we will employ phage populations passaged > 10 times and prolong the treatment duration, actively exploring strategies to counteract phage resistance.

Our findings establish vB_KpnP_XY3 and vB_KpnP_XY4 as viable candidates for combating MDR-K. pneumoniaeinfections, demonstrating synergistic potential with existing antibiotics while maintaining favorable safety profiles. These findings reinforce the paradigm of precision phage therapy while underscoring the necessity for continued research into phage-bacteria-host tripartite interactions. Future directions should prioritize humanized infection models, standardized potency assessment frameworks, and clinical trials to translate phage therapeutics from the bench to the bedside.
