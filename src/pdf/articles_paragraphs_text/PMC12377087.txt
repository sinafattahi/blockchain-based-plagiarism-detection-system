Macrovipera lebetinus lebetinusis the sole venomous snake species endemic to Cyprus, with its population declining due to habitat loss and persecution. The taxonomic status of this species remains uncertain, and there is a significant gap in available genetic information. Here, we present the first complete mitochondrial genome ofM. lebetinus lebetinus, obtained from two specimens. The mitogenomes (17,151 bp and 17,152 bp) include the standard 37 genes—13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs—as well as two control regions. Comparative analysis reveals a conserved gene order typical for Viperidae but also an unprecedented structural modification: the complete loss of the D-arm in tRNA-Cys, a feature previously unreported in snakes. Phylogenetic analysis confirms the monophyly ofM. lebetinus lebetinusandM. lebetinus schweizeri. These findings contribute essential genetic data for this under-documented species, providing valuable molecular markers for future phylogenetic and conservation studies.

Although the phylogeny of the genusMacrovipera (M.) has undergone several taxonomic revisions (Linnaeus1758; Herrmann et al.1992; Lenk et al.2001; Stümpel2012; Cattaneo2020; The Reptile Database2023), genetic resources for this species remain limited. To date, only the mitochondrial genome ofM. lebetinus schweizerihas been published (Thanou and Kornilios2018), leaving a significant gap in the genetic information available forM. lebetinus lebetinus.

In this study, we report for the first time the complete mitochondrial genome ofM. lebetinus lebetinus.The obtained mitogenomes, 17,151 bp and 17,152 bp in length, comprise the typical set of 37 genes – 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs – and features two control regions. Our analysis characterizes the genomic architecture and identifies novel aspects in tRNA secondary structures, which may serve as valuable molecular markers for future phylogenetic and conservation studies.

Two specimens ofM. lebetinus lebetinus(S 56087 and S 56088) were obtained from the collection of the Staatliches Naturhistorisches Museum (Braunschweig), where they are registered under the accession numbers SNHMB-N.56087 and SNHMB-N.56088. These specimens were originally collected in 2014 on Cyprus (coordinates for S 56087: N 35°01.941′ E 32°27.872′; coordinates for S 56088: N 34°58.938′ E 32°31.795′) and preserved in 80% denatured ethanol.

Approximately 10 mg of tissue per specimen was placed in a heatblock at 56 °C for evaporation of excess liquid. Remaining liquid was removed by centrifugation using a DNeasy Mini Spin Columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Blood&Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and quality and quantity of DNA were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany).

Genomic DNA was sheared to approximately 500 bp using a Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) and concentrated with Sartorius VIVACON 500 (Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). Fragment sizes were analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the DNA 7500 Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using ThruPlex DNA-Seq Kit (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA) and re-checked on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before sequencing on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) (300 cycles) using a High Output Flow Cell v2.5 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). For S 56087, 120,724,635 paired-end reads (≈14.7 Gb) and for S 56088, 134,848,237 paired-end (≈18.6 Gb) reads were obtained.

The mitochondrial genomes were assembled by combining reference-guided and de novo approaches using the published mitogenome ofM. lebetinus schweizeri__Werner 1935 (NCBI accessionMH717075) as a reference (Thanou and Kornilios2018). Assemblies were performed with SeqMan NGen v17.5.0.48 (DNASTAR), Sequencher v5.4.6 (GeneCodes Corporation), and BWA-MEM (Li and Durbin2009). A coverage depth map is provided in thesupplementary materials (Figures S1andS2).

Polymorphic positions within the control regions were resolved by PCR and Sanger sequencing using primers designed with Primer3 (Kõressaar et al.2018). Primer details are provided in thesupplementary materials (Table SI).Figure 3.

Gene prediction and annotation were performed using MITOS 2.0 (Bernt et al.2013) and visualized with OGDRAW (Greiner et al.2019). The secondary structures of 22 tRNA genes were inferred using tRNAscan-SE (Chan and Lowe2019).

For phylogenetic analysis, complete mitogenomes from eight Viperinae species were obtained from GenBank. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT v7.526 (Katoh and Standley2013) and analyzed with IQ-TREE v2.4.0 (Minh et al.2020), employing ModelFinder Plus (Kalyaanamoorthy et al.2017) for model selection and 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (Hoang et al.2018). The maximum likelihood tree was visualized using iTOL v6 (Letunic and Bork2024).

The complete mitochondrial genomes of twoM. lebetinus lebetinusspecimens were sequenced and deposited in GenBank under the accession numbersPQ571331andPQ571332.

The total lengths were determined to be 17,152 bp (S 56087) and 17,151 bp (S 56088), with a nucleotide composition of 32% A, 28% C, 13% G, and 27% T. Both genomes contained the standard 37 genes: 13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and feature two complete control regions (D-loops) along with a putative L-strand replication origin (OL) (Figures 2and3; Supplementary Material –Tables S2and 3).

The gene pattern conforms to the III-B type arrangement observed inViperidae(Qian et al.2018) – characterized by duplication of the control region and a rearrangement of tRNA-Leu2. In most vertebrates, tRNA-Leu2 is located between 16S rRNA and ND1; whereas inM. lebetinus lebetinusit is shifted between the control region and tRNA-Gln, a configuration common in otherViperidae(Hamdan et al.2023). Moreover, the OL is identical to that reported inM. lebetinus schweizeri(Thanou and Kornilios2018).

The lengths of the PCGs ranged from 165 bp to 1,788 bp. Five different start codons were observed: ATA, ATC, GTG, ATG and ATT. Stop codons included AGA, TAA and AGG, with six genes terminated with incomplete T. These features are consistent with otherViperidaemitogenomes, includingM. lebetinus schweizeri(Thanou and Kornilios2018; Montaña-Lozano et al.2023). The higher AT than GC content is typical for reptile mitochondrial genomes (Montaña-Lozano et al.2023) (Figures 2and3; Supplementary Material –Tables S2and3).

All 22 tRNA genes were identified, with lengths ranging from 53 to 73 bp. While most tRNAs adopted to the typical cloverleaf structure, tRNA-Ser1 and tRNA-Cys lacked a dihydrouridine arm (D-arm). The absence of the D-arm in tRNA-Ser1 is a common trait among metazoans (Jühling et al.2012); however, a complete loss of the D-arm in tRNA-Cys is unprecedented in snakes and has only been reported in certein amphibians,Tunicata,Bryozoa,Platyhelminthes,Arthropoda,Nematoda,Lepidosauriaand mammals (Arnason et al.1997; Macey et al.1997; Jühling et al.2012). InColubridae, an abnormal tRNA-Cys lacking the TΨC loop has been documented (Shan and Wang2022). This appears to be the first report of a complete D-arm loss in tRNA-Cys withinViperidae. Despite structural modifications, previous studies suggest that such tRNA remein functional (Jühling et al.2012). (Supplementary Material–Figure S3) The 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes were separated by tRNA-Val, maintaining a conserved arrangement typical for vertebrate mitogenomes (Boore1999) (Figures 2and3; Supplementary Material –Tables S2andS3).

Two non.coding control regions were identified: CR I was located between tRNA-Thr and tRNA-Phe and CR II was situated between tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Leu2. These structures are conserved withinViperidae, although slight variation in length and placement are observed among snake families (Hamdan et al.2023) (Figures 2and3;Supplementary Material–Tables S2andS3).

The best-fit substitution model selected by ModelFinder was TIM2 + F + I + G4, according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Phylogenetic analysis using nine complete mitochondrial mitogenomes of Viperinae robustly supports the monophyly ofM. lebetinus lebetinusandM. lebetinus schweizeri(bootstrap value 99). The maximum likelihood tree places the genusMacroviperaas a sister group toDaboia(bootstrap value 100), in agreement with previous studies on Viperidae (Chowdhury et al.2022) (Figure 4).

Interestingly, the tree also suggests a paraphyletic placement of Echis, with Vipera berus nested within the clade. However, this relationship is poorly supported (bootstrap values <35) and likely reflects limited phylogenetic resolution at this level.

This study provides the first complete mitochondrial genome for the persecutedM. lebetinus lebetinus. The mitogenomes (17,151 bp and 17,152 bp) encompass the canonical 37 genes and two control regions, exhibiting the typical III-B gene arrangement observed in Viperidae (Qian et al.2018). Notably, the mitochondrial genome reveals novel features in tRNA secondary structure – specifically, the complete loss of the D-arm in tRNA-Cys – which has not been previously reported in snakes (Arnason et al.1997; Macey et al.1997; Jühling et al.2012).

These findings contribute essential genetic data forM. lebetinus lebetinus, enhancing our understanding of its evolutionary history and phylogenetic position within Viperidae. The molecular markers identified here will be valuable for future phylogenetic and conservation studies, particularly in light of ongoing habitat loss and human persecution.
