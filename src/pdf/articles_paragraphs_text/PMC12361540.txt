Amygdala-hippocampal connectivity is a promising area of study for an understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of depression. In this study, we examined the association between amygdala-hippocampal connectivity and depressive symptoms in children with a specific focus on the subnuclei level. We then examined whether self-concept mediated brain-behavior associations. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at age 7.5 years (N = 319), followed by self-reported depressive symptoms and self-concept between ages 8.5 and 10.5 years, using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI-2) and Piers-Harris Children’s Self-Concept Scale (PHCSC) respectively. We conducted multiple regression analyses to examine the associations between the amygdala-hippocampus resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and CDI scores, first at the whole-region level and subsequently at the subnuclear level. Mediation analyses were then performed to explore the mediating role of self-concept in these brain-behavior associations. We observed a significant association between left amygdala-anterior hippocampus connectivity and CDI total scores, primarily driven by the left superficial amygdala. Further exploration at sub-symptomatic levels highlighted an association with negative cognition. Finally, self-concept mediated the association between left amygdala-anterior hippocampus connectivity and depressive symptoms in children. This study provided valuable insights into the associations among amygdala-hippocampal subnuclei connectivity, childhood depressive symptoms, and self-concept. Diminished left superficial amygdala-anterior hippocampus connectivity may serve as an early biomarker to identify depressive symptoms, particularly in children with negative cognition problems.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental health problem in childhood and adolescence worldwide [1,2]. It can lead to serious consequences, including impaired social and academic functioning and an increased risk of suicide, smoking, substance abuse, and obesity [2]. An estimated 19.5% of US adolescents aged 12–17 years have been diagnosed with at least one major depressive episode [3] while 16.9% of children aged 8–12 years in Singapore exhibited clinically elevated depressive symptoms [4]. These numbers could potentially be higher because depression in children and adolescents can be difficult to diagnose and may be underreported due to symptom variation from the adult criteria. Indeed, a study demonstrated different phenotypic and genetic structures associated with depressive symptoms in childhood (8–10 years), adolescence (15–17 years), and young adulthood (20 years) [5]. Childhood-onset depression is currently poorly understood in terms of neurobiological mechanisms, and this gap hinders the development of effective targeted treatment for childhood depression.

The amygdala and hippocampus are critical brain regions of the limbic system with established relevance for depression [6]. They are interconnected and work in synchrony to regulate emotions and process emotionally salient memories, further contributing to their relevance in depression [7,8]. In adolescents aged 13–18 years, research has shown a decrease in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the amygdala and hippocampus, which is associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms [9]. A separate study revealed that adults with MDD exhibited increased amygdala-hippocampal connectivity when recalling negative autobiographical memories, suggesting heightened emotional reactivity [10]. The amygdala and its functionally connected region, the hippocampus, have also been implicated in fear learning and stress-related conditions in both human and rodent research [11]. Evidence from rodent models indicates that early life stress, an established risk factor for depressive disorders, alters amygdala-hippocampal RSFC [12]. Similarly, task-based fMRI studies in humans have revealed disrupted connectivity within this circuit in response to psychosocial stress [13], further highlighting the role of amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. An early study by Luking et al. provided preliminary evidence that children aged 7–11 years who were either depressed or at high risk for depression showed weaker RSFC between the amygdala and other limbic brain regions, including the hippocampus [14]. Notwithstanding this body of evidence, there is a scarcity of research that specifically examines the involvement of amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in childhood depression.

Furthermore, most existing studies of amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in relation to depressive symptoms do not consider the underlying complexity of these limbic brain regions. The amygdala, known for its functional heterogeneity, consists of three subnuclei groups: the centromedial, basolateral and superficial amygdala, each with distinct connectivity patterns and functions [15], including specific roles in depression [16]. For instance, the centromedial amygdala has been implicated in the association between maternal aggressive behavior and depressive disorders in adolescents [17]. A more recent study revealed distinct abnormal RSFC patterns across amygdala subregions in adolescents with major depressive disorders [18]. Similarly, the hippocampus is topographically and functionally organized and can be subdivided into the anterior and posterior regions, each with distinct functions [19,20]. Both the anterior and posterior hippocampus have been implicated in depression, not only in terms of disorder susceptibility [21] but also treatment response [22]. Research using animal models has shown that the basolateral amygdala and ventral (anterior) hippocampus are crucial sites implicated in the chronic stress-induced alterations in brain connectivity observed in individuals with depression [6]. Functional connectivity of the amygdala subnuclei also varies across different mood states, with RSFC of lateral amygdala and anterior hippocampus being particularly associated with depression [23]. Interestingly, a recent study by Guan et al. revealed that the RSFC between the centromedial amygdala and hippocampus is significantly different between adolescents and adults with depression [24]. Overall, these presented evidence emphasized the importance of considering amygdala and hippocampal subregions separately when studying their connectivity profiles in relation to depressive symptoms in children and adolescents.

An appreciation of the importance of sex is critical in dissecting the heterogeneity of childhood depression and its underlying neural mechanisms. The National Institute of Health has also mandated that sex be considered a biological variable in neuroscience research [25]. There have been reports of sex differences in incidence of depression, symptom expression, and brain structure and function, predominantly in adult and adolescent-onset depression. Indeed, a more recent report suggests the emergence of sex differences in depressive symptoms prior to age 11 years [26]. By adolescence girls show higher levels of depressive mood and negative self-esteem, while teenage boys show higher levels of interpersonal difficulties and anhedonia [27,28]. Females also exhibit higher local connectivity (regional homogeneity) in both the amygdala and hippocampus compared to males [29]. In another study, distinct sex differences were observed in amygdala subnuclei RSFC, with preliminary evidence suggesting the role of estrogen levels [30]. However, sex differences in childhood depression are severely understudied. It is currently unknown whether connectivity profiles of the amygdala and hippocampal subregions are associated with specific depressive sub-symptom(s) in childhood and whether, if present, these associations exhibit significant differences between boys and girls.

In addition, depression is a multifaceted mental disorder influenced by various etiological factors [31]. This complexity suggests the presence of other mediating variables influencing the association between amygdala-hippocampal connectivity and childhood depressive symptoms. Among these variables, self-concept holds significance in the context of depression and exhibits a strong correlation with the engagement of both amygdala [32] and hippocampus [33]. As defined by Piers and Herzberg [34], self-concept pertains to a relatively enduring collection of attitudes that encompass both the description and evaluation of an individual’s own behaviors and attributes, which can be also assessed through the Piers-Harris Children’s Self-Concept Scale (PHCSC-2). A positive self-concept in children promotes psychological development and associates with general well-being and positive social relations. Disparities in self-concept have been identified as predictors of depressive symptomatology and the susceptibility to major depression [35]. Research indicates that children with depressive symptoms tend to exhibit lower self-concepts compared to their typically developing peers [25]. Enhanced self-concept has been linked to a reduction in depressive symptoms [36]. Moreover, self-concept has served as a moderator or mediator in the relation between various variables, such as parental psychological control [37], anxiety and depressive symptoms [38]. Consequently, our study also sought to investigate whether self-concept can mediate the association between amygdala-hippocampus connectivity and depressive symptoms in childhood.

Our deeply-phenotyped Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort with a large sample size of children with both neuroimaging and behavioral phenotyping (N = 319) provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to address the critical knowledge gaps outlined above. Resting-state fMRI was acquired at age 7.5, followed by self-concept assessment at age 8.5 and assessment of depressive symptoms between ages 8.5 and 10.5. Using this unique dataset, we examined the associations between subnuclei-level amygdala-hippocampus resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and childhood depressive symptoms. RSFC refers to the coupling of spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, as measured with fMRI, between discrete brain regions or networks. Given the differentiated roles of the amygdala and hippocampal subregions, along with evidence from animal models and adult studies on depression [6,23], we hypothesize that basolateral amygdala and anterior hippocampus RSFC may show stronger associations with childhood depressive symptoms. We further hypothesized that self-concept may mediate the association between amygdala-hippocampal connectivity and depressive symptoms.

Participants were recruited from Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO), a large longitudinal birth cohort study in Singapore. In the present study, a total of 319 children (M = 7.452, SD = 0.14, age range = 7.25–8.033; 168 girls) who underwent resting-state fMRI scans at age 7.5 years were included (Fig.1A). Depressive symptoms were assessed between ages 8.5 and 10.5 years (M = 9.343, SD = 0.599, age range = 8.707–10.752) using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI-2). Self-concept was assessed at age 8.5 years using the Piers-Harris Children’s Self-Concept Scale, Second Edition (PHCSC-2) (M = 8.888, SD = 0.074, age range = 8.708–9.22; 119 girls, 105 boys). Descriptive statistics of study variables and their sex differences are delineated in Table1.

The GUSTO study was approved by the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (NHG DSRB) and the SingHealth Centralized Institutional Review Board (CIRB), conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All guardians of the children participating in the current study provided written informed consent.

The 28-item CDI-2 was employed to evaluate depressive symptoms in children [39]. For each item, the subjects were given three options corresponding to three levels of symptoms: 0 (no symptoms), 1 (mild or probable symptoms), or 2 (definite symptoms). In the current analysis, the CDI total scores were employed, whereby higher scores denoted heightened severity of depressive symptoms. Additionally, to capture nuanced depressive sub-symptoms within our dataset, we implemented a novel factor structure for the CDI-2, redefined from the exploratory factor analysis based on the extensive GUSTO dataset [40]. This revised structure encompasses four second-order factors: Negative Emotion, Social Isolation, Negative Cognition, and Vegetative Symptoms (Table2).

The 60-item PHCSC-2 was employed to assess children’s self-concept. It covers six content scales that assess different aspects of self-concept: Physical Appearance and Attributes, Freedom from Anxiety, Intellectual and School Status, Behavioral Adjustment, Happiness and Satisfaction, and Popularity. It also includes two validity scales to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Children respond with a “yes” or “no” answer. The total score from this scale, reflecting an individual’s perception of themselves, was used in the current analysis. A higher score indicates a more positive self-concept, while a lower score suggests a more negative self-concept [34].

Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at age 7.5 using a 3-Tesla scanner (Magnetom Prisma; Siemens, Germany). Three-dimensional T1-weighted images were acquired using a Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo (MP-RAGE) Sequence with the following imaging parameters: repetition time = 2000ms, echo time = 2.08 ms, 1 mm isotropic voxels, matrix size = 192 × 192, and number of slices = 192. One run of single-shot echo-planar resting-state fMRI was collected using the following parameters: 5.24 min (120 time points), repetition time = 2620 ms, echo time = 27 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees, 3 mm isotropic voxels, matrix = 64 × 64, 48 interleaved axial slices with no gap.

The resting-state fMRI data preprocessing was performed using the default pipeline in the CONN toolbox (version 20b) [41] and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) in Matlab (R2020a, MathWorks, Inc., USA). Briefly, functional realignment and unwarp, slice-timing correction, outlier identification, direct segmentation and normalization, and functional smoothing were performed. Functional images were initially realigned to the first image using b-spline interpolation and then corrected for temporal misalignment between different slices. The intermediate outlier identification setting in the CONN toolbox was applied to identify scan volumes with framewise displacement above 0.9 mm or global BOLD signal changes exceeding 5 standard deviations. Then functional and anatomical data were normalized into standard MNI space and segmented into grey matter, white matter, and CSF tissue classes [42]. Lastly, functional data was smoothed using spatial convolution with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM. Denoising was performed using Ordinary Least Squares regression to remove potential noise confounds [43], and a temporal band-pass filter between 0.008 Hz and 0.09 Hz was applied. Subsequently, amygdala functional connectivity analysis was conducted. For each subject, separate Seed-Based Connectivity (SBC) maps were generated based on individual amygdala regions-of-interest (ROIs) by calculating Fisher-transformed bivariate correlation coefficients of the BOLD time series using a hemodynamic response factor-weighted general linear model.

There are a total of eight amygdala ROIs included in the study (Fig.1B), consisting of the left and right whole amygdala, as well as their subregions: basolateral (BLA), centromedial (CMA), and superficial amygdala (SFA). The masks of amygdala subregions were defined using SPM Anatomy Toolbox 1.8 [44], based on cytoarchitectonic probability maps [45] with a probability of 60%. Non-overlapping amygdala subregions were then generated using the methodology outlined in a previous paper [46]. The masks of the whole amygdala were created by combining respective subregions within each hemisphere. The anterior (aHIP) and the posterior hippocampus (pHIP) were defined based on the Brainnetome Atlas [47].

Statistical analyses of the behavioural indices and demographic variables were conducted using SPSS Statistics 26 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).

To investigate the association between depressive symptoms and amygdala-hippocampus RSFC, we adopted a three-step approach. This method encompassed an initial exploration of associations with general depressive symptoms at the whole-regional level, followed by a more specific subregional exploration. Furthermore, we conducted further exploratory analyses to examine the subregional correlations with specific sub-symptoms.

Specifically, we conducted separate multiple regression analyses on the RSFC of the entire bilateral amygdala using SPM12. In these analyses, the CDI total scores were used as predictors, while controlling for covariates of non-interest including age at the time of MRI scan, age at the CDI assessment, and ethnicity. To establish statistical significance, we applied T-contrasts with small volume correction on the bilateral anterior and posterior hippocampus, using a voxel-level threshold ofp< 0.05 (family-wise error, FWE corrected). Subsequently, to further elucidate the precise amygdala subregions driving the identified significant associations, we employed the same statistical approach to analyze the RSFC of the left and/or right BLA, CMA, and SFA. Lastly, we also exploratively examined the associations between the RSFC of identified amygdala subregions and specific sub-symptoms defined with the new factor structure of the CDI-2 in the GUSTO cohort study [40].

To explore potential sex effects within identified significant associations, we employed the MarsBaR toolbox [48] implemented in SPM to extract parameter estimates from the significant hippocampal clusters. Utilizing these parameter estimates, separate partial correlation analyses with CDI scores were conducted for both boys and girls, including the same covariates of no interest. Visualization was accomplished through scatter plots using the ggplot package in R (version 4.2.2).

Finally, to assess the mediating role of self-concept on the identified brain-behavior associations, we conducted mediation analyses using the PROCESS macro for SPSS v4.2 [49].

Based on the published factor analysis results [40], the modified hierarchical model for CDI-2’s factor structures has a significantly improved goodness-of-fit (χ2(342) = 590.96, χ2/ df = 1.73, GFI = 0.936, CFI = 0.910, and TLI = 0.900, RMSEA = 0.034 [90% CI: 0.029, 0.039]). In the current study, the mean levels of depressive symptoms across the entire sample (N = 319) are shown with CDI total scores (M = 11.3, SD = 7.2), and sub-scores of Negative Emotion (M = 1.9, SD = 2.3), Social Isolation (M = 2.4, SD = 2.1), Negative Cognition (M = 4.8, SD = 2.9) and Vegetative Symptoms (M = 2.1, SD = 1.8). Based on established cut-off scores for different levels of severity [50], 224 subjects in the current study had CDI total scores below 15 and were classified as not depressed, 54 subjects were mildly depressed (15–19 scores), 25 were moderately depressed (20–24 scores), and 16 were severely depressed with scores more than 25. Among the entire sample, 224 children successfully completed the Piers-Harris Children’s Self-Concept Scale, resulting in an average total score of M = 43.3 (SD = 8.9). Table1presents descriptive statistics for these variables separately for boys and girls. Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to examine sex differences, but no statistically significant differences were found in scores or completion age (p> 0.1 for all cases).

To examine the associations between CDI total scores and the whole amygdala - hippocampus RSFC, we conducted separate multiple regression analyses for the left and right whole amygdala RSFCs. Utilizing the left and right hippocampus as ROIs, we found a significant negative association between CDI total scores and the left amygdala-hippocampus RSFC (k= 7,t= 3.9,p= 0.02,x/y/z: -12/-8/-16). Further investigation focused on the left hippocampus using its anterior and posterior subregions as separate ROIs revealed that the negative association was primarily driven by the anterior hippocampus (aHIP,k= 5,t= 3.9,p= 0.017,x/y/z: -12/-8/-16; Table3). These results suggest that reduced RSFC between the left amygdala and left anterior hippocampus is linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms. Notably, we did not find any significant association between CDI total scores and right amygdala-hippocampus RSFC.

To identify the specific amygdala subregion driving the aforementioned association, we conducted separate multiple regression analyses for the RSFCs of left CMA, BLA and SFA. Using the left aHIP as a ROI, we found a significant negative association between CDI total scores and left SFA - left aHIP RSFC (k= 3,t= 3.6,p= 0.045,x/y/z: -20/-14/-18; Table3). This finding suggests that reduced RSFC between left SFA and left aHIP is linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms. We did not observe any significant associations for the RSFCs of left CMA or BLA subregions and left aHIP.

To explore the specific depressive sub-symptoms driving the above association, we conducted exploratory analyses employing the four CDI sub-scores: Negative Emotion, Social Isolation, Negative Cognition and Vegetative Symptoms. We found a significant negative association between Negative Cognition sub-scores and left SFA-aHIP RSFC (k= 12,t= 3.57,p= 0.048,x/y/z: -20/-18/-22; Table3). This finding indicates that lower RSFC between left SFA and aHIP is associated with more negative cognition. No significant associations were found for the other three sub-symptoms.

To further explore potential sex effects in the associations, separate follow-up partial correlation analyses were conducted for boys and girls, controlling for ethnicity, and age at MRI scan and CDI assessment. The result revealed significant negative associations of the left SFA – aHIP RSFC with CDI total scores for both sexes (boys,r= −0.197,p= 0.018; girls,r= −0.165,p= 0.035; Fig.2A), and with the negative cognition sub-scores for both sexes (boys,r= −0.244,p= 0.003; girls,r= −0.161,p= 0.039; Fig.2B). There were no significant sex differences in CDI total scores and sub-scores, age at MRI scan or questionnaire completion, and the above amygdala – hippocampus RSFCs (p> 0.1 for all variables).

To assess the influence of self-concept on the identified associations, we conducted partial correlation analyses between self-concept total scores, RSFCs, and CDI scores, controlling for ethnicity, and age at MRI scan, CDI and self-concept assessments. The results showed a positive correlation between self-concept total scores and left whole amygdala-left anterior hippocampus RSFC (r= 0.168,p= 0.013), and a negative correlation with CDI total scores (r= −0.735,p< 0.001), confirming the mediation test condition. Using SPSS PROCESS model 4, we found a significant mediation model (R2= 0.525,p< 0.001), showing that self-concept significantly mediated the association between the amygdala – anterior hippocampus RSFC and childhood depressive symptoms (Fig.3). Specifically, through a 5000-sample bootstrap procedure, we found a significant indirect effect for the mediator self-concept to depressive symptoms (β = −0.123, 95% CI: −0.211 – −0.034), while there was no significant direct effect from the amygdala – hippocampus RSFC to depressive symptoms observed in the total model (β = −0.069, p = 0.141), indicating a complete mediating effect of self-concept.

We provided evidence of a negative association between the left amygdala and anterior hippocampus RSFC and depressive symptoms in children. This study also represents the first investigation into this association at the subnuclei and sub-symptom levels, suggesting that the superficial amygdala and negative cognition are primarily responsible for this association. In addition, we provided novel evidence that self-concept, a critical element in the pathogenesis of childhood and adolescent depression, mediated the association between left amygdala – anterior hippocampus RSFC and childhood depressive symptoms.

The present findings align with existing literature documenting the negative correlation between amygdala – hippocampus RSFC and general depression in depressed adolescents [9]. Both children at high risk of depression [14] and adults with early-onset depression [51] have also exhibited reduced amygdala – hippocampus RSFC. These consistent findings underscore the significance of amygdala – hippocampus RSFC in relation to depressive symptoms across age groups. Given the role of the amygdala and anterior hippocampus in emotional response [52] and episodic memory [53], increased functional connectivity between them may facilitate the encoding and retrieval of emotionally laden memories. Conversely, reduced connectivity between them might lead to difficulty in regulating negative emotions and biased memory processing, particularly in the recall and rumination of negative memories – a prominent feature of the cognitive model of depression [54]. Our study adds to the growing evidence that underscores the significance of the amygdala – hippocampus functional connectivity in the emergence of depressive symptoms in both adults and children.

Subnuclei-level analysis revealed that the association between amygdala-hippocampal connectivity and childhood depressive symptoms was primarily driven by the superficial amygdala (SFA) and anterior hippocampus. Specifically, reduced left SFA – anterior hippocampus RSFC was significantly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in children, particularly those related to negative self-cognitions. This association persisted when analyzing boys and girls separately. The SFA assumes a pivotal role in social-affective processing [55] and is associated with heightened sensitivity to positive social cues and increased alertness to potential threat signals [56,57]. The SFA’s connection with the frontoparietal network contributes to top-down emotional regulation, with reduced connectivity potentially indicating regulation deficits [58]. Consequently, our findings suggest that decreased connectivity between SFA and anterior hippocampus may disrupt the synchronized functionality required for effective emotion-cognition interactions in children. This disruption could potentially result in the ineffective emotional regulation tied to negative memories, exacerbating negative self-cognition, and subsequently intensifying depressive symptoms. While our hypothesis correctly implicated the anterior hippocampus, our findings highlighted the role of the SFA, rather than the BLA, in relation to depressive symptoms in children. It is important to note that our initial hypothesis was largely based on adult studies and animal models of depression, which may not fully apply to the current study on children. Hence, it is indeed not surprising that different amygdala subregions may play a different role in depressive disorders at different developmental phases across the lifespan. The susceptibility of subcortical brain regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus to early life influences such as maternal mental health and socio-economic status may also partially explain the differential neurocircuitry mechanisms in children and adults [59,60]. Research has shown that during early childhood (3 months to 5 years), the amygdala undergoes rapid volumetric changes [61], with distinct connectivity patterns emerging from the SFA and BLA [62]. For instance, the BLA typically exhibits average positive connectivity with the hippocampus in children, whereas the SFA predominantly shows average negative connectivity. Furthermore, although both the SFA and BLA undergo age-related changes in functional networks, only the SFA shows connectivity changes with subcortical regions [62].

We observed that the left-hemispheric amygdala drives the brain-behavior associations identified in our study. Both left and right amygdala are implicated in depression [63,64], with distinctive roles in emotional processing [65]. For example, the left amygdala contributes to sustained and voluntary explicit emotional evaluation, while the right amygdala is involved in rapid and automatic implicit “threat detection” types of emotional processing [66]. Also, the left amygdala is more active to verbal-related emotions, whereas the right amygdala responds more to visual-related and more direct emotional stimuli [65]. These differences may explain our findings on the association between left amygdala RSFC and depressive symptoms, particularly negative cognition which is a sustained emotional assessment of an individual’s experiences and memories, usually formed through self-dialogue, inner speech, or introspective thinking. In conjunction with the role of the hippocampus in emotional processing and episodic memory, the involvement of the left amygdala reflects its role in sustained negative emotional assessment and verbal-related emotional responses.

As hypothesized, self-concept significantly mediated the association between amygdala – hippocampus RSFC and childhood depressive symptoms. This suggests that how children perceive themselves may act as a bridge between neural connectivity and depressive symptoms. This aligns with prior studies indicating a strong association between self-concept and depression [25,36], with self-concept exerting a stronger impact on depression than the other way around [67]. Self-concept encompasses an individual’s beliefs and evaluations about themselves, which interact with the processing of emotional memories. For instance, higher self-concept has been linked to faster retrieval of positive autobiographical memories [68]. Given the pivotal roles of the amygdala and hippocampus in emotional processing and memory, numerous neuroimaging studies have supported their involvement in self-concept [32,33]. Diminished connectivity between these regions may lead to disruptions in emotion regulation and abnormal recall of negative experiences, thereby contributing to a negative self-concept, and an increased risk of depressive symptoms in children. Consistent with previous studies [69,70], this finding points to a potential “brain–personality–symptom” pathway that may contribute to the alleviation of depressive symptoms in childhood.

The current study examined the underlying neural mechanisms of childhood depressive symptoms, a rather long-neglected topic, focusing on the functional connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus at the subnuclei level to specify relevant connections in the child brain with precision. We also found the mediating role of self-concept on the association between amygdala-hippocampus RSFC and childhood depressive symptoms, enhancing our understanding of the neural-psychological interplay in childhood depression. Several limitations of this study should, however, be considered. While all findings were FWE corrected (p< 0.05), multiple comparisons correction was applied only to the whole amygdala RSFC analyses, not to the subregional analysis, which should be considered when interpreting the results. Motion artifacts can confound neuroimaging-based studies of brain development; however, we addressed this with rigorous processing and de-noising protocols, and motion levels in our cohort were low (mean absolute motion: M = 0.105, SD = 0.047). The sample consisted solely of Singaporean children, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Future research should include more diverse populations and examine adolescents to assess developmental consistency. As our findings are based on correlational analyses, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Longitudinal studies tracking changes in self-concept, neural connectivity, and depressive symptoms may help clarify causal pathways. Future work could also incorporate additional factors such as genetic variation, family dynamics, and socioeconomic conditions. As this study only examined functional connectivity, future research should also explore other brain measures, such as local intrinsic activity [71] and structural–functional coupling [72], to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying childhood depressive symptoms.

In conclusion, this study contributes valuable insights into the associations among amygdala-hippocampus RSFC, childhood depressive symptoms, and self-concept. The functional connectivity between the left superficial amygdala and the anterior hippocampus may serve as an early marker to identify depressive symptoms, particularly in children with negative cognition problems. Additionally, diminished amygdala-hippocampus RSFC may contribute to a negative self-concept, increasing the risk of depressive symptomatology. Further research employing longitudinal designs is essential to validate and expand upon these findings.
