Sleep bruxism is a common parafunctional activity that can lead to progressive tooth wear and long-term restorative consequences. Although occlusal splints are widely used to prevent tooth surface loss, the extent of wear in splint-wearing patients remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed to evaluate volumetric tooth wear in canines and first molars among sleep bruxism patients treated with occlusal splints using digital intraoral scanning.

A prospective cohort of 16 patients (mean age 27.9 ± 4.5 years) diagnosed with sleep bruxism and wearing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) upper occlusal splints was followed for 18 months. Intraoral scans were performed at baseline and follow-up using the TRIOS 4®scanner. Volumetric wear was assessed on the masticatory surfaces of upper and lower canines and first molars using best-fit superimposition and STL analysis software. Statistical comparisons of model volume between upper and lower teeth and between timepoints were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significant level of 0.05.

All tooth groups showed statistically significant volumetric tooth reduction over 18 months (p< 0.001). However, no significant differences in wear were observed between the upper and lower arches for either canines (p= 0.940) or first molars (p= 0.207). Grinding-type bruxism was more prevalent than clenching-type in the cohort (11 grinding-type and 5 clenching-type patients).

While PMMA splints may help reduce tooth wear during sleep-related bruxism, measurable tooth wear still occurred. Therefore, effective management of sleep bruxism requires combining splint therapy with comprehensive strategies, such as behavioral and dietary counseling, and regular monitoring.

Bruxism is a parafunctional activity of the masticatory system that can occur during sleep (sleep bruxism) or wakefulness (awake bruxism) [1]. Sleep bruxism, once categorized as a sleep-related movement disorder, is characterized by rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) leading to teeth clenching or grinding [2]. Although its etiology remains multifactorial and not fully understood, neurological, psychological, and genetic factors are thought to contribute [3,4]. Clinically, patients may present with tooth wear, tooth fractures, jaw muscle pain, temporomandibular disorders (TMD), and headaches [5].

Beyond its clinical manifestations, bruxism imposes a considerable economic burden by increasing the risk of mechanical failure in dental restorations such as crowns, bridges, and implants. Several studies have reported a higher incidence of implant failure among bruxers, and the replacement of compromised prostheses may involve substantial treatment costs, highlighting the economic impact of untreated bruxism [6–8].

Currently, there is no definitive treatment for sleep bruxism. Various management approaches have been proposed, including pharmacological, psychological, and dental interventions.

Among dental approaches, the use of occlusal splints is one of the most common strategies. These intraoral appliances serve as protective barriers, preventing direct contact between opposing teeth and thereby reducing mechanical wear [9]. This concept is based on the principle that when two materials of differing hardness interact, the softer material is more susceptible to wear.

However, the effectiveness of occlusal splints in preventing tooth wear remains uncertain. A systematic review highlighted the lack of clinical studies focusing specifically on tooth wear reduction as a primary outcome, with most research instead addressing pain management [10]. Although Potewiratnanond et al. [11] explored tooth wear on splint-covered teeth under experimental conditions, clinical evidence regarding the extent of tooth wear in patients wearing occlusal splints remains limited.

Traditional methods for assessing tooth wear, such as visual inspection and conventional impressions, are limited by subjectivity, low sensitivity to minor changes, and the risk of material distortion [12]. These limitations reduce their reliability for longitudinal monitoring, especially in early or gradually progressing cases.

In contrast, digital intraoral scanners (IOS) offer a reproducible, non-invasive method for capturing three-dimensional dental surfaces with micrometer-level accuracy [13]. Volumetric analysis using IOS data enables sensitive and objective detection of structural changes over time.

Given these technological advantages and the lack of longitudinal clinical studies specifically evaluating the protective effects of occlusal splints on tooth wear, this study aimed to assess volumetric tooth wear in sleep bruxism patients over an 18-month period using IOS technology.

This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Masticatory Science, Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Thailand. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board (COA No. MU-DT/PY-IRB 2023/068.1110). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.

All participants were diagnosed with probable sleep bruxism based on a combination of subject-based and clinically based assessments. The clinical assessment included findings suggestive of sleep bruxism, such as mechanical tooth wear, masticatory muscle hypertrophy, tongue or lip indentations, and a linea alba on the buccal mucosa. This diagnostic approach aligns with the international consensus criteria for probable sleep bruxism [1]. In addition, distinct wear facets were observed on the occlusal surfaces of their upper occlusal splints during routine six-month follow-up appointments.

Eligible participants were required to regularly wear a clear polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) upper occlusal splint with canine guidance. The canines and first molars in both the upper and lower arches had to be free from periodontal disease, large restorations, crowns, or caries. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, ongoing orthodontic treatment, or an inability to attend follow-up appointments.

A priori sample size calculation was conducted using the n4Studies software. Assuming a two-tailed paired t-test with an alpha level of 0.01, 90% power, a standard deviation of 39.97, and an effect size of 47.00, the estimated minimum required sample size was 11 participants. To account for potential dropouts, 22 participants were initially recruited; six withdrew due to scheduling issues, resulting in a final sample of 16 participants.

A limitation of IOS is their inability to scan clear splints, which must be coated with an opaque material to allow scanning. However, this process can introduce significant errors. Therefore, an indirect method was used in this study by comparing the wear of upper teeth covered by the splint with the lower teeth to determine whether there was a difference.

Intraoral scans were obtained at baseline (T0) and after 18 months (T1) using the TRIOS 4®(3Shape, Denmark, released in 2019), a high-resolution digital optical device. Calibration was performed prior to each scanning session. All scans and analyses were conducted by a single trained examiner to ensure intra-examiner consistency.

Scanning procedures followed the manufacturer’s guidelines, including scanner tip preheating, standardized scanning paths, teeth polishing with pumice, soft tissue retraction, and maintenance of a dry field. Consistent scanning angles and ambient lighting were maintained to minimize artifacts [14].

Volumetric analysis was performed using Geomagic Design X software (3D Systems, USA). Each target tooth was trimmed into an individual tooth 3D model. Superimposition of T0and T1models was carried out using the “global and fine” alignment function. An identical cutting plane was applied at the incisal third of canines or the occlusal third of first molars to remove irrelevant areas. After trimming, a second superimposition was performed to refine the alignment.

Prior to selecting the areas of interest (AOIs), a best-fit comparison between baseline and follow-up 3D models was performed to ensure accurate alignment and appropriate AOIs positioning. AOIs measuring 1 × 1 mm² were then defined for each tooth on the masticatory surfaces of upper and lower canines and first molars, focusing on regions with apparent volumetric loss. Regions outside the AOIs were trimmed, and the remaining volumes (V) within the AOIs were calculated in cubic millimeters (mm³).

where V0and V1​ represent the model volumes at baseline and 18 months, respectively.

For each tooth type, the left and right measurements were averaged to obtain a single representative value. These values were then used to compare differences between the upper and lower arches.

The procedures for model superimposition, trimming, and definition of AOIs are demonstrated in Fig.1.

To assess measurement consistency, five teeth were randomly selected for repeated volumetric wear analysis by the same examiner after a two-week interval. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for volumetric wear values was 0.949, indicating excellent intra-examiner reliability.

Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. As several variables violated the assumption of normal distribution (p< 0.05), non-parametric tests were employed.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to (1) assess differences in average volumetric wear between the upper and lower arches, and (2) compare model volume between baseline and the 18-month follow-up for each tooth type.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 20 (IBM, USA). Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

A total of 16 participants (8 males and 8 females; mean age 27.9 ± 4.5 years) completed the 18-month follow-up (74.0 ± 2.4 weeks). The mean age was 27.0 ± 3.42 years for females and 28.5 ± 4.98 years for males. Eleven participants were classified as grinding-type bruxers and five as clenching-type. Descriptive analysis showed greater volumetric wear in males across all teeth, especially in upper first molars (0.0246 mm³ at T0vs. 0.0123 mm³ at T₁). Grinding-type bruxers were observed more frequently in males (75%) compared to females (62.5%). Baseline demographic characteristics and volumetric tooth wear measurements are summarized in Table1.

Volumetric wear differences between the upper and lower arches are presented in Table2. Although the lower arch demonstrated slightly greater median volumetric wear than the upper arch in both canines and first molars over 18 months, these differences were not statistically significant.

For the canines, the median volumetric loss was 0.0215 mm³ in the upper arch and 0.0260 mm³ in the lower arch (p= 0.940). For the first molars, the median wear was 0.0148 mm³ in the upper arch and 0.0116 mm³ in the lower arch (p= 0.207).

Volumetric measurements at T₀ and T₁ are summarized in Table3. A statistically significant reduction in tooth volume was observed across all tooth types over the 18-month period (p< 0.001 for all comparisons).

Among the canines, the median volumetric values decreased from 0.1569 mm³ to 0.1248 mm³ in the upper right canine and from 0.1658 mm³ to 0.1266 mm³ in the upper left canine. In the lower arch, reductions were also observed, with the lower left canine decreasing from 0.1750 mm³ to 0.1439 mm³, and the lower right canine from 0.1636 mm³ to 0.1437 mm³.

Similar reductions were observed in the first molars. The upper right first molar volume decreased from 0.1372 mm³ to 0.1246 mm³, and the upper left from 0.1588 mm³ to 0.1434 mm³. In the lower arch, the left first molar declined from 0.1600 mm³ to 0.1541 mm³, and the right first molar from 0.1328 mm³ to 0.1165 mm³. The latter representing the lowest T1volume among all teeth examined.

All reductions between T0and T1were statistically significant, confirming measurable occlusal wear across both arches and all tooth types.

To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to assess volumetric tooth wear using IOS in sleep bruxism patients wearing clear PMMA-based occlusal splints over an 18-month period.

The main findings revealed no statistically significant differences in volumetric tooth wear between the upper and lower arches, despite measurable enamel loss. This comparable wear pattern suggests that occlusal splints may exert a protective effect on both arches. These results are consistent with those of Korkut et al. [9], who reported reduced tooth wear in splint users. However, their study relied on two-dimensional linear measurements across five surfaces of the upper central incisors using cast models and auxiliary tools such as ultrasound and FluoreCam. In contrast, the present study employed IOS and three-dimensional volumetric analysis of canines and first molars, providing a broader assessment of occlusal wear distribution.

To further contextualize our findings, reference to existing quantitative studies on tooth wear progression is essential. Several previous studies have reported quantitative values of tooth wear. For instance, O’Toole et al. [15] conducted a 3-year longitudinal study involving 29 participants and reported a mean volumetric loss of − 0.029 mm³/mm² on first molars. However, their measurements were conducted across the entire occlusal surface before normalization by surface area, which may have included wear resulting from non-functional factors. In contrast, our analysis focused exclusively on predefined functional AOIs, specifically those subject to attritional forces. The resulting wear volume in our study ranged from 0.0059 to 0.0163 mm³/mm² on first molars over an 18-month period, which is substantially lower than the values reported by O’Toole et al., thereby limiting direct comparisons.

Nonetheless, we recognize that the relatively lower wear values observed in our study may also be influenced by differences in scanner resolution, follow-up duration, and surface definitions. These methodological distinctions warrant cautious interpretation of inter-study comparisons.

Canines and first molars were selected due to their high susceptibility to occlusal wear and distinct functional roles. The upper canines exhibited the highest volumetric wear among anterior teeth in a 13-year longitudinal study using 3D superimposition techniques, underscoring their role in functional guidance [16]. First molars were reported to exhibit the greatest wear among the measured posterior regions, particularly at the mesiobuccal cusp of the mandibular first molar, likely due to their early involvement in occlusal function and high functional loading [17].

The 18-month follow-up period was selected to balance scientific relevance with clinical feasibility, as it serves as a midpoint between previous IOS-based studies that reported detectable wear at 12 and 24 months [18]. This timeframe allowed sufficient observation of measurable change while minimizing dropout.

The observed protective effect may be partially explained by the material properties of PMMA, which has lower hardness and flexural strength compared to natural enamel, as reported in recent materials researches [19,20]. In two-phase systems, the softer material tends to undergo initial abrasion, preserving the integrity of the harder surface [21]. Potewiratnanond et al. further demonstrated that PMMA has an 11-fold greater wear rate than dentin under in vitro conditions simulating bruxism [11]. This preferential wear of the splint material likely contributes to the preservation of tooth structure and may help explain the comparable volumetric wear observed between upper and lower teeth in the present study.

The significant volumetric reduction observed over the 18-month period indicates that tooth wear occurred despite the use of occlusal splints during sleep. This suggests that daytime functional activities, when splints are not worn, may have contributed to ongoing enamel loss in both arches.

Although statistical testing was limited by sample size, descriptive analysis revealed a trend toward greater volumetric tooth wear in males across all examined teeth. This observation may be attributed to sex-related differences in masticatory biomechanics. Previous studies have shown that males typically exhibit higher maximum bite forces than females [22], contributing to increased mechanical stress and accelerated tooth wear.

In this study, both clenching and grinding patterns of sleep bruxism were observed among participants, with grinding being more prevalent (11 out of 16 participants). This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that grinding patterns are more common than clenching in sleep bruxism [23].

This study highlights the methodological strengths of using three-dimensional volumetric analysis with IOS to monitor tooth wear in sleep bruxism patients. Compared to traditional methods such as visual indices or vertical depth measurements, volumetric analysis captures both surface area and depth changes, making it particularly suitable for detecting broad, shallow wear patterns characteristic of grinding-type bruxism. Two-dimensional or depth-based techniques may underestimate such wear patterns, while three-dimensional volumetric analysis enables more comprehensive detection and quantification of diffuse surface loss typical of grinding. IOS also provide high sensitivity and reproducibility for longitudinal monitoring [24]. The ability to longitudinally compare three-dimensional models enhances the detection of subtle changes and supports their clinical applicability [25]. Identifying even small volumetric changes using digital superimposition can alert clinicians to patterns of wear progression, guide the timing of splint replacement or adjustment, and support the need for periodic occlusal assessment. Clinically, this information can inform the choice of splint material, reinforce behavioral education, and signal when adjunctive occlusal or restorative interventions may be necessary to prevent irreversible structural loss. Furthermore, tracking volumetric wear may help detect high-risk patients who require closer follow-up intervals and multidisciplinary management. Despite these strengths, several limitations should be considered. First, the absence of a control group without splint therapy limits the ability to attribute wear reduction directly to the intervention, although this approach aligns with ethical standards in clinical practice. Second, while the 18-month follow-up period was clinically meaningful, it may not fully capture the long-term progression of tooth wear associated with sleep bruxism. Third, the potential influence of daytime activities could not be entirely excluded, as objective monitoring tools such as electromyography were difficult to employ. Fourth, although the clinical diagnostic criteria for probable sleep bruxism were rigorously applied, instrumental confirmation (e.g., polysomnography or electromyography) remains a gold standard for sleep bruxism assessment in term of the characteristic of masticatory muscle activity during sleep. Thus, the intensity of masticatory muscle activity during grinding or clenching could not be observed in this study. Further study may investigate on the volumetric tooth wear after wearing occlusal splint in relation to different intensities of masticatory muscle activity. Finally, although efforts were made to minimize scan alignment errors through model processing and intra-examiner validation, minor inaccuracies inherent to 3D superimposition techniques may have affected the precision of volumetric measurements.

Nonetheless, the estimated intra-scanner volumetric error of the TRIOS®system was approximately 0.0045 mm³, based on its reported precision (4.5 ± 0.9 μm), which was smaller than the lowest observed wear volume in this study (0.0059 mm³), suggesting that the measured changes exceeded the threshold of methodological variability [26].

Although the current study has a follow-up period of 18 months, extended follow-up in future studies is encouraged to better capture the chronic progression of tooth wear and evaluate splint durability. Objective monitoring tools, such as electromyography, could help clarify the relative impact of daytime and nocturnal activity on wear patterns. Establishing reference volumetric values for physiologic wear is recommended to support accurate interpretation of pathological change. Additionally, expanding sample sizes and stratifying participants by factors such as age, sex, and bite force may provide further insights into individual variability in bruxism-related wear and guide more personalized treatment strategies. Future studies with larger and more diverse cohorts may enhance the generalizability and allow for subgroup analyses.

This study found no statistically significant differences in volumetric tooth wear between the upper and lower arches over an 18-month period, suggesting that PMMA-based occlusal splint could help distribute occlusal forces evenly and offer a protective effect during sleep bruxism. However, measurable volumetric enamel loss was still observed in all tooth types, highlighting that splints alone may not fully prevent tooth wear.

These findings underscore the importance of combining splint therapy with adjunctive strategies such as behavioral modification, dietary counseling, and routine dental monitoring to help reduce cumulative mechanical wear.

Volumetric analysis using IOS proved to be a reliable and clinically valuable method for detecting subtle changes in tooth structure over time.

In summary, PMMA-based occlusal splints are supported as a protective adjunct in the management of sleep bruxism when combined with long-term monitoring and patient-centered care.
