Prostate cancer (PC) is a significant global health concern, particularly among older men (OM), and smoking is a well-established modifiable risk factor contributing to its incidence and mortality. However, a comprehensive assessment of the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM, with specific analyses by age and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions, is still lacking. This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to systematically analyze the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM (aged 55 years and older) from 1990 to 2021. The analysis included trends in deaths and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) across different age groups and SDI regions. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and Joinpoint regression analysis were employed to assess temporal trends. From 1990 to 2021, the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM exhibited a significant decline, with the age-standardized death rate decreasing from 3.08 per 100,000 in 1990 to 1.80 per 100,000 in 2021 (EAPC: -2.02, 95% CI: -2.14 to -1.90). Similarly, the age-standardized DALY rate decreased from 65.28 per 100,000 in 1990 to 37.75 per 100,000 in 2021 (EAPC: -2.05, 95% CI: -2.16 to -1.94). However, disparities across SDI regions were evident. The high SDI region experienced the most substantial decline in burden. In contrast, the low-middle SDI region showed an increasing trend, highlighting enduring socioeconomic disparities. Notably, Despite the overall reduction in the global burden, the burden among the older age group, specifically 90–95 years old, remained the most severe in 2021. This study reveals a complex landscape of the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM, with an overall decline masking enduring socioeconomic disparities and a severe burden among the older age group. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and public health strategies to address these disparities. Future efforts should focus on implementing smoking cessation programs and improving healthcare access in vulnerable populations.

Prostate cancer (PC) is frequently diagnosed among men globally and ranks as the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men1,2. According to the latest data from GLOBOCAN 2022, PC presents a significant global health burden. In 2022, there were an estimated 1,467,854 new cases of PC globally, making it the fourth most common cancer in terms of incidence. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) worldwide was 29.4 per 100,0003. This situation is even more severe than the data from GLOBOCAN 2020, which reported approximately 1,414,259 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 20204. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the prostate gland, a male reproductive organ primarily responsible for producing seminal fluid5,6. The symptoms of PC may include difficulty urinating, frequent urination, pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or thighs, and blood in the urine or semen7,8. Pathologically, PC can be classified into different grades and stages, ranging from indolent forms that may require minimal treatment to aggressive variants necessitating prompt and aggressive therapeutic interventions9.

The economic burden associated with PC is substantial. A study by the American Cancer Society estimated that the total economic burden of PC in the United States alone was over $20 billion annually, highlighting the significant financial impact of this disease10. And according to a study focusing on Eswatini, the total annual cost of PC in Eswatini was estimated at $6.2 million in 2018, with the highest costs associated with advanced disease stages III and IV, which accounted for $1.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively11. Therefore, addressing the burden of PC is crucial for developing sustainable healthcare policies and interventions that can mitigate the financial strain on individuals, healthcare systems, and societies.

The high prevalence and mortality associated with PC also underscore the importance of understanding its etiology and risk factors to inform public health interventions. A multitude of risk factors have been implicated in the etiology of PC, including age, family history, genetics, diet, and lifestyle habits12,13. Age is the primary risk factor for PC, with its incidence rising sharply as men grow older. It is most prevalent in men over the age of 55, highlighting the significant burden this cancer places on the old men (OM) population14. Modifiable risk factors such as smoking, diet, and physical activity have also been implicated in the development and progression of PC15,16. Among these, smoking has emerged as a significant and modifiable risk factor15. Epidemiological studies have consistently reported a positive association between smoking and the risk of PC17. For instance, previous studies have shown that smokers are at a higher risk of developing PC compared to never-smokers18. The magnitude of this association varies across studies, but the overall evidence supports a causal link between smoking and PC risk19. Furthermore, smoking has been linked to more aggressive forms of PC, which are associated with poorer prognosis and higher mortality rates20. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified smoking as a probable cause of PC, highlighting its public health significance21. Smoking prevalence varies across different age groups and regions. In some low- and middle-income countries, smoking rates among older adults remain high due to limited tobacco control measures and a lack of awareness about the health risks associated with smoking22,23.

Despite the accumulating evidence linking smoking to PC risk, there remains a significant research gap in the literature regarding the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM. Existing research has primarily focused on specific populations or regions, providing fragmented insights into the overall impact of smoking on PC burden24,25. This research gap limits the ability of policymakers and public health practitioners to develop targeted interventions aimed at reducing the global burden of smoking-related PC. A global perspective is essential to identify regional disparities, inform resource allocation, and guide preventive strategies.

In this study, we aim to address the research gap by analyzing the latest data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to assess the global burden and trends of PC attributable to smoking among OM (males aged 55 years old or older) from 1990 to 2021. Our study will cover a comprehensive range of geographical regions, including both developed and developing countries, to capture the variations in the burden of smoking-attributable PC across different populations. By filling this gap, we can provide valuable insights into the potential health benefits of smoking cessation programs and tobacco control policies on PC prevention and control by providing evidence-based support. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies and interventions targeting high-risk populations and regions, ultimately improving the overall health outcomes for OM affected by PC.

This research is a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM from 1990 to 2021. The data utilized in this study were sourced from the GBD 2021, primarily led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, USA26. To extract the data, the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) platform website (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) was accessed to locate datasets related to the burden of PC caused by smoking in the OM population. The GBD study utilizes a comprehensive and robust methodology to generate estimates of health outcomes. It integrates a vast array of data from diverse sources, such as surveys, censuses, vital registration systems, and published studies. For the GBD 2021 study, the methodologies employed for diagnosing and estimating health impacts, particularly in relation to risk factors, have been meticulously documented in numerous prior publications27.

The dataset utilized in this research includes data on the number and rates per 100,000 population of death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) with their Uncertainty Interval (UI) of PC burden due to smoking in the OM (males aged more than 55 years). UI reflects stochastic and systematic errors in GBD modeling. And according to prior studies, the age of 55 is often used as a threshold in public health research to define older males28,29. And the data is divided by age group (55–59 years, 60–64 years, 65–69 years, 70–74 years, 75–79 years, 80–84 years, 85–89 years, 90–94 years, 95 + years), geographical area, and time period. Because all of the rates are age-standardized, it is viable for comparison between populations with different age patterns.

DALY offers an all-encompassing evaluation of the disease’s impact by integrating the years lost due to early death (YLLs) and the years spent living with disability (YLDs). In our study, the data on mortality and DALYs of the burden from PC attributable to smoking among OM were meticulously extracted from the GBD dataset. These extracted data formed the basis of our subsequent analysis. The GBD defined the PC as the malignant neoplasms of the prostate and of which the International Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD-11 code) is 2C82. And the definition of smoking in GBD study is current daily or occasional use of any smoked tobacco product, which is a well-established risk factor for PC.

This research complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER)30. Given that this study utilized publicly available data from the GBD 2021, there was no need for direct interaction with people or communities. Consequently, this study did not seek ethics approval.

In our study, we described the global burden of PC attributed to smoking among OM using deaths and DALYs key metrics. The SDI, a metric developed by the IHME, functions as a measure to reflect the level of development achieved by different countries and regions31. The SDI is constructed by combining three fundamental metrics through the geometric mean. These metrics include the total fertility rate among people under the age of 25, which reflects the reproductive patterns of a younger population segment. The second metric is the average years of education attained by individuals aged 15 and above, capturing the educational attainment level of the adult population. The third component is the lag-distributed income per capita, which adjusts for the temporal distribution of income across different age groups to provide a more accurate representation of economic well-being. In the GBD 2021, the SDI was computed using a unique scaling method. Initially, the raw SDI values were derived from a range of 0 to 1, reflecting the baseline developmental status of countries and regions. To enhance clarity and facilitate comparison, these values were then multiplied by 100, transforming the scale to a more intuitive range of 0 to 100. In GBD, the 204 countries and territories were categorized into five distinct groups based on their SDI values. The high SDI group included regions with an SDI value greater than 0.81, representing the most developed areas characterized by high income levels, extensive educational attainment, and low fertility rates. Following this, the high-middle SDI category encompassed countries and territories with an SDI ranging from 0.70 to 0.81, and the middle SDI regions with values between 0.61 and 0.69, the low-middle SDI with an SDI value ranging from 0.46 to 0.60, and finally, regions with an SDI value below 0.46 were classified as low SDI.

The EAPC was determined using the formula: 100 * (exp () −1), whererepresents the slope coefficient obtained from the regression model. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the EAPC were derived directly from this model. When analyzing these trends, an upward trajectory is indicated if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the EAPC is greater than zero. This suggests that the rate is increasing at a statistically significant level over the study period. Conversely, a downward trend is identified when the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than zero, indicating a statistically significant decline in the rate. However, if the 95% CI includes zero, this implies that the observed changes are not statistically significant, and we conclude that the rates have remained relatively stable over time34–36.

Population attributable fractions (PAFs), a statistical method for quantifying the extent to which a health outcome can be attributed to a specific exposure were employed by the study to elucidate the proportion of PC deaths and DALYs among OM globally and within specific GBD regions that could be linked to smoking in 1990 and 2021. The PAF calculations were based on the prevalence of smoking and compared it against the Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure Level (TMREL), which serves as a reference point representing the lowest possible risk level for smoking-related health outcomes. In essence, the PAFs helped to estimate the burden of PC deaths and DALYs that could be directly associated with smoking by contrasting the observed smoking exposure levels with the ideal scenario represented by the TMREL. This approach allowed the researchers to determine the proportion of PC-related health outcomes that could potentially be avoided if smoking were reduced to the TMREL27.

We conducted an age-specific analysis of the smoking-attributable PC burden across global and various SDI regions to further refine our understanding of the impact of smoking on PC among OM. The study focused on the population of OM, defined as males aged 55 years and above. To achieve a more granular analysis, the data were divided into specific age groups within the OM category, namely 55–59 years, 60–64 years, 65–69 years, 70–74 years, 75–79 years, 80–84 years, 85–89 years, 90–94 years, and 95 + years. This detailed age stratification enabled us to examine how the burden of smoking-related PC varies across different life stages of older males. Additionally, this age-specific analysis allowed us to explore how the burden of smoking-related PC evolves as individuals progress through different stages of later life24.

A correlation analysis was carried out to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the disease burden of PC attributable to smoking and the developmental status of regions. This analysis specifically focused on correlations of the death and DALY rates of PC caused by smoking among the OM across various GBD regions with their corresponding SDI values from 1990 to 2021. We chose to use the Pearson correlation coefficient as prior published studies have employed similar methods, and these correlations are pooled across years to capture the overall temporal trends comprehensively37. Our primary objective was to meticulously calculate the correlation coefficients between these variables and to rigorously assess their corresponding statistical significance. By doing so, we aimed to further elucidate the intricate associations that exist between the disease burden of PC attributable to smoking in the OM and the varying developmental statuses of the regions under investigation38,39.

Using Joinpoint regression analysis as a complementary analytical tool, we further explored the temporal trends and changes in the death and DALY burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM. This sophisticated statistical method offers valuable insights into the dynamic patterns of disease burden over time by dividing the data into multiple connected linear segments. In this analysis, the magnitude and direction of change within each identified trend segment were quantified by calculating the annual percentage change (APC) for that segment. The APC essentially measures the rate of increase or decrease in the burden of smoking-related PC during each specific period. To provide a comprehensive summary of the overall trend across the entire study period, we integrated all the individual segments and calculated the average annual percent change (AAPC). The AAPC is derived from the weighted average of the APCs across all segments, taking into account the duration and magnitude of each trend period. And the number of joinpoints allowed was determined using the grid search method (GSM). Essentially, the Joinpoint model employs the GSM to establish all potential joinpoints for segmented functions, calculating the mean squared errors (MSE) for each possible scenario. The number of joinpoints corresponding to the minimum MSE was selected as the final quantity. The criteria for model selection were based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which balances model fit and complexity40–42.

All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed by employing Joinpoint software (version 5.2.0.0) and R programming language (version 4.4.1, R Project for Statistical Computing). The presence of statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed P-value of less than 0.05.

As illustrated by Tables1and2, between 1990 and 2021, the overall death number from smoking-induced PC increased significantly from an estimated 9,596.02 (95% UI: 4,488.18 to 15,496.29) in 1990 to 12,607.44 (95% UI: 5,722.18 to 21,021.82) in 2021, marking a substantial increment of 31.38%. However, the age-standardized death rate per 100,000 OM showed a marked decline, shifting from 3.08 (95% UI: 1.44 to 4.97) in 1990 to 1.8 (95% UI: 0.82 to 3.01) in 2021 with The EAPC of −2.02 (95% CI: −2.14 to −1.9), reflecting a reduction over the three-decade span.

In terms of DALYs, the global burden of PC among OM attributable to smoking has also shown a significant increase from 1990 to 2021. The total DALYs increased from 203,328.44 (95% UI: 95,363.41 to 321,550.33) in 1990 to 264,035.75 (95% UI: 122,549.43 to 432,657.57) in 2021, representing an increase of 29.86%. The age-standardized DALY rate per 100,000 OM demonstrated a downward trend, moving from 65.28 (95% UI: 30.62 to 103.23) in 1990 to 37.75 (95% UI: 17.52 to 61.85) in 2021 with an EAPC of −2.05 (95% CI: −2.16 to −1.94).

According to Tables3and4, and Fig.1, from 1990 to 2021, the global burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM showed variations across different age groups. In 1990, the highest number of death cases was observed in the 75–79 years age group, with a total of 2,114.52 (95% UI: 996.82 to 3,447.71). By 2021, there was a notable increase in death cases across all age groups, with the most substantial increase seen in the 95 + years age group, which experienced a percentage change of 241.06%. And in 2021, the 70–74 years age group had the highest number of death cases, amounting to 2,312.74 (95% UI: 1,076.58 to 3,764.21). The death rates per 100,000 population from PC attributable to smoking among OM exhibited a significant decline across all age groups from 1990 to 2021. In 1990, the highest death rate was observed in the 90–94 age group, with a rate of 20.39 (95% UI: 8.81 to 35.99) per 100,000. By 2021, these rates had significantly decreased across all age groups, with the most pronounced reduction in the 75–79 age group, having an EAPC of −2.72 (95% CI: −2.83 to −2.62). However, the 90–94 age group still had the highest death rate at 12.08 (95% UI: 4.95 to23.17) per 100,000 population.

Regarding the global DALY burden in different age groups, in 1990, the burden of DALYs attributable to PC among OM was most significant in the 65–69 age group, with a count of 44,108.27 (95% UI: 21,178.63 to 69,196.01). By 2021, a marked increment in DALYs was observed across most of the age groups, with the most significant rise occurring in the 75–79 age group, showing a percentage change of 119.97%. Similarly, the highest number of DALYs was still found in the 65–69 age group with a number of 53,761.46 (95% UI: 25,164.05 to 83,908.23). The DALY rates per 100,000 population mirrored the trend of death rate. In 1990, the age group 90–94 had the highest DALY rate of 181.4 (95% UI: 78.58 to 320.1) per 100,000 population. By 2021, these rates had experienced a substantial decrease across all age groups, with the most substantial reduction observed in the 75–79 age group with an EAPC of −2.68 (95% CI: −2.79 to −2.57). However, the highest DALY rate was again observed in the 90–94 age group at 107.51 (95% UI: 43.99 to 205.59) per 100,000 population.

As can be seen from Tables1and2, in 1990, the high SDI region had the highest burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM, with 5,302.46 (95% UI: 2,465.42 to 8,616) deaths and a death rate of 6.56 per 100,000 (95% UI: 3.05 to 10.65). In contrast, the low SDI region had the lowest burden, with 177.68 (95% UI: 69.45 to 298.13) deaths and a death rate of 0.93 per 100,000 (95% UI: 0.36 to 1.56) in 1990. By 2021, the high SDI region still have the highest number of deaths at 4,551.71 (95% UI: 2,023.3 to 7,786.21) and the highest death rate of 2.83 per 100,000 (95% UI: 1.26 to 4.85), and the low SDI region again exhibiting the lowest burden with 349.32 (95% UI: 148.31 to 576.32) death cases and the lowest death rate at 0.87 per 100,000 (95% UI: 0.37 to 1.43). The most pronounced reduction in death burden was observed in the high SDI region, with an EAPC of −3.21 (95% CI: −3.39 to −3.03).

Regarding the DALYs, in 1990, the high SDI region also had the highest burden with 111,610.85 (95% UI: 51,973.14 to 180,650.45) DALYs and a rate of 137.98 per 100,000 (95% UI: 64.25 to 223.34), while the low SDI region had the lowest burden with 3,939.31 (95% UI: 1,510.27 to 6,607.27) DALYs and a rate of 20.56 per 100,000 (95% UI: 7.88 to 34.49) in 1990. By 2021, the high SDI region also had the highest DALYs number at 95,004.35 (95% UI: 43,393.63 to 43,393.63) and the highest DALY rate at 59.15 per 100,000 (95% UI: 27.02 to 97.45), and the low SDI region had the lowest with 7,616.42 (95% UI: 3,169.57 to 12,544.32) DALYs and the lowest rate of 18.94 per 100,000 (95% UI: 7.88 to 31.19). The most significant reduction in DALY rate was found in the high SDI region, with an EAPC of −3.18 (95% CI: −3.33 to −3.03).

As shown by Tables3and4, it is observed that in 2021, the 90–95 years age group had the highest death and DALY rates across all SDI regions. Specifically, the death rates per 100,000 OM for this age group were as follows: high SDI at 15.53 (95% UI: 6.68 to 28.71), high-middle SDI at 12.34 (95% UI: 4.96 to 23.22), middle SDI at 8.97 (95% UI: 3.75 to 16.57), low-middle SDI at 6.93 (95% UI: 2.88 to 12.51), and low SDI at 4.44 (95% UI: 1.73 to 7.93). The DALY rates per 100,000 OM for the same age group were: high SDI at 139.27 (95% UI: 54.77 to 281.96), high-middle SDI at 109.26 (95% UI: 43.87 to 206.14), middle SDI at 79.07 (95% UI: 32.99 to 145.87), low-middle SDI at 60.89 (95% UI: 25.31 to 109.92), and low SDI at 39.02 (95% UI: 15.2 to 78.62).

In terms of changes of death rates from 1990 to 2021, the most significant decline in the high SDI region was observed in the 75–79 age group, with an EAPC of −4.11 (95% CI: −4.31 to −3.92). And in the low SDI region, the 65–69 age group exhibited the most pronounced decrease, with an EAPC of −0.78 (95% CI: −0.91 to −0.65). For the changes of DALY rates, the greatest reduction from 1990 to 2021 was also noted in the 75–79 age group within the high SDI region, with an EAPC of −3.95 (95% CI: −4.14 to −3.75), and in the low SDI region, the 65–69 age group again showed the most significant decline, with an EAPC of −0.75 (95% CI: −0.88 to −0.62).

As depicted in Tables1and2, in 2021, the Caribbean region exhibited the highest death rate attributed to smoking-related PC among OM, with a rate of 5.07 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2.16 to 9.02). In the same year, Eastern Europe had the highest DALY rate due to smoking-attributable PC, standing at 109.72 per 100,000 (95% UI: 51.91 to 174.8). Conversely, South Asia had the lowest death rate and DALY rate in 2021, with values of 0.73 per 100,000 (95% UI: 0.33 to 1.26) and 14.45 per 100,000 (95% UI: 6.41 to 25.22), respectively. Regarding the changes in death rates and DALY rates from 1990 to 2021, Australasia showed the most significant decline in both metrics. The death rate in Australasia decreased with an EAPC of −4.27 (95% CI: −4.61 to −3.93), and the DALY rate also saw a substantial reduction with an EAPC of −4.34 (95% CI: −4.74 to −3.94).

As can be seen from Fig.2, in 1990, East Asia bore the highest proportion of deaths and DALY burden from PC attributable to smoking among OM, with PAFs reaching 6.25% for deaths and 7.01% for DALYs. Conversely, Western Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited the lowest proportions for both death and DALY burdens attributable to smoking, with PAFs of 0.86% and 0.96%, respectively. By 2021, Eastern Europe had become the region with the highest proportions, maintaining PAFs of 4.94% for deaths and 5.69% for DALYs of PC burden attributable to smoking. Western Sub-Saharan Africa continued to have the lowest proportions, with PAFs slightly increasing to 0.87% for deaths and 1.01% for DALYs, respectively.

As shown by Figs.3and4, in 1990, Denmark emerged as the country with the highest death rate and DALY rate, standing at 15.53 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 7.05 to 25.56) and 289.87 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 131.07 to 477.31), respectively (data not shown). Conversely, Ethiopia had the lowest death rate and DALY rate, with figures of 0.28 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 0.10 to 0.55) and 6.66 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 2.28 to 12.89), respectively. By 2021, Georgia took over as the country with the highest death rate and DALY rate, at 8.98 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 3.89 to 14.09) and 193.84 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 84.84 to 306.92), respectively. Oman, on the other hand, had the lowest death rate at 0.23 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 0.09 to 0.41), while Ethiopia maintained the lowest DALY rate at 4.89 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 1.70 to 9.75).

As revealed by Fig.5, both the death and DALY rates per 100,000 population of PC burden attributable to smoking among OM exhibit statistically significant positive correlations with the SDI of the global scale and different regions from 1990 to 2021 (p< 0.001). Specifically, the death rate correlates with the SDI at a coefficient of 0.485, and the DALY rate shows a slightly stronger correlation at 0.506. These positive correlation coefficients indicate that as the SDI increases, both death and DALY rates associated with smoking-related PC among OM also tend to increase, albeit moderately.

As manifested byTableS1,Table S2, Figs.6and7, the results from Joinpoint regression analysis offer insights into the temporal trends of the burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM globally and SDI regionally from 1990 to 2021. For the death rate, the AAPC was − 1.72 (95% CI: −1.74 to −1.70), signifying a consistent decline over the three-decade period. When examining the SDI regions, the High SDI region experienced the most pronounced decline, with an AAPC of −2.69 (95% CI: −2.73 to −2.65). This was followed by the High-middle SDI region with an AAPC of −1.07 (95% CI: −1.10 to −1.04), the Middle SDI region with an AAPC of −0.42 (95% CI: −0.45 to −0.39), and the Low SDI region with an AAPC of −0.20 (95% CI: −0.22 to −0.18). Notably, the Low-middle SDI region exhibited a contrasting trend, with an AAPC of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.28), indicating a slight increase over the period.

In terms of DALY rates, the global AAPC was − 1.75 (95% CI: −1.77 to −1.73), mirroring the decline observed in death rates. The High SDI region again showed the most significant decrease, with an AAPC of −2.72 (95% CI: −2.77 to −2.68). The High-middle SDI region had an AAPC of −1.07 (95% CI: −1.11 to −1.04), the Middle SDI region had an AAPC of −0.53 (95% CI: −0.55 to −0.50), and the Low SDI region had an AAPC of −0.20 (95% CI: −0.22 to −0.18). The Low-middle SDI region, however, also showed a positive trend with an AAPC of 0.14 (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.18), suggesting a minimal increase in DALY rates. These findings are generally in agreement with the EAPCs, reinforcing the observed downward trend in the burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM from 1990 to 2021.

Our study, leveraging the latest data from the GBD 2021 data, offers a pioneering and comprehensive portrayal of the PC burden attributable to smoking among OM. From 1990 to 2021, a significant global decline in this burden was observed. However, a nuanced pattern emerged: while high SDI regions experienced the most substantial decrease, low-middle SDI areas saw an upward trend. Notably, despite the overall downward trajectory, the burden remained heaviest among men aged 90–95 years old. This study explores the complex interplay between smoking, PC, and socioeconomic disparities in the context of an aging male population, providing a granular view of a critical public health issue that has been underexplored in this demographic segment. The novelty of our study lies in its comprehensive analysis of the global burden of PC attributable to smoking specifically among men aged 55 and above, with detailed stratification by age groups and SDI regions. While GLOBACON statistics are available and other GBD studies have examined prostate cancer burden, our focus on the older male population and the specific attribution to smoking with specific analyses by age and SDI regions provides unique insights into the interplay between aging, smoking, and socioeconomic disparities.

Our study observed a decline in the burden of PC attributable to smoking among OM from 1990 to 2021. This finding is noteworthy given the overall increasing trend of prostate cancer incidence globally3. While the global incidence of prostate cancer has risen, particularly in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where a 125.1% increase in age-standardized incidence was reported from 1990 to 202124, our study highlights a distinct trend in smoking-attributable cases among older men. The decline in smoking-attributable PC burden among OM may be attributed to several factors. First, global smoking prevalence has decreased significantly over the past decades, particularly in high-income countries where smoking cessation programs and public health interventions have been effective. This reduction in smoking rates has likely contributed to the observed decline in smoking-attributable PC burden among older cohorts25,43. Additionally, improvements in prostate cancer screening and treatment, such as the widespread adoption of PSA testing and advanced therapeutic modalities, have likely mitigated the impact of smoking on prostate cancer outcomes5,44. These advancements have shifted the stage of detection to earlier, more treatable phases of the disease, thereby reducing the overall burden.

Despite the overall decline in PC burden attributable to smoking among OM, our study found that high SDI regions experienced the most substantial decrease, while low-middle SDI regions showed an upward trend. This disparity is likely related to the abundant medical resources and more widespread cancer screening and treatment in high SDI regions17. In contrast, low-middle SDI regions may face a greater disease burden due to limited medical resources, insufficient cancer screening, and persistently high smoking rates45,46. For example, in the MENA region, the incidence of prostate cancer increased significantly from 1990 to 2021, which is closely related to high smoking rates, uneven distribution of medical resources, and complex socio-economic factors in the region24. While low-middle SDI regions have shown increasing trends in the burden of smoking-attributable PC, low SDI regions have exhibited declining trends despite facing many similar challenges. The downward trend in low SDI regions may be related to several facts: First, there has been an increase in public health support from the international community for low-income countries, including funding and technical assistance for tobacco control programs. Second, some low-SDI countries have recently strengthened their tobacco control legislation, such as increasing tobacco taxes, banning tobacco advertising, and promoting smoke-free environments. Third, with the improvement of education levels and the enhancement of health awareness, the smoking rate in some low-SDI regions has begun to decline gradually. Fourth, the gradual improvement of health care services has enabled earlier diagnosis and treatment of PC, which may have reduced the disease burden. As for the increase in PAFs for smoking-attributable PC in Eastern Europe, this could be attributed to a combination of factors, including changes in smoking prevalence, healthcare policy shifts, and the implementation of tobacco control laws. Despite global efforts to reduce smoking rates, Eastern Europe has seen a unique trajectory, with smoking prevalence remaining relatively high in certain sub-regions. This persistence can be partly explained by the historical context of smoking culture and the challenges in implementing effective tobacco control measures. Healthcare policy shifts and the implementation of tobacco control laws have had a significant impact on the management and treatment of chronic diseases, including PC, in Eastern Europe. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on early detection and treatment, which has improved the overall health outcomes for many conditions. However, the effectiveness of these policies in reducing the burden of smoking-attributable diseases may be limited by the continued high prevalence of smoking. The interplay between these factors suggests that while healthcare policies have improved the management of PC, the persistent high smoking rates continue to contribute significantly to the disease burden. Additionally, the role of tobacco control laws cannot be overlooked. While many countries in Eastern Europe have implemented tobacco control measures, the enforcement and impact of these laws vary widely. Some regions have seen significant reductions in smoking rates due to strong anti-smoking campaigns and strict regulations, while others continue to struggle with high smoking prevalence. The differential impact of these laws on smoking behavior and subsequent health outcomes underscores the complexity of addressing smoking-related diseases in this region.

Our analysis revealed that disease burden is still highest among OM between the ages of 90 and 95 years, even though the overall trend in the prevalence of PC among OM due to smoking is decreasing. This finding is consistent with studies in the MENA region, where mortality and DALYs from prostate cancer peak in this age group47,48. This age-related difference may be attributable to the longer smoking history and greater cumulative exposure among older individuals, as well as the challenges in treatment options and disease management for elderly patients17,25. Our study focused on men aged 55 and above, the high burden in the oldest age group suggests that future research should pay further attention to the prostate cancer risk among elderly men, especially those aged 90 to 95 years. We emphasize targeted smoking control in the age group above 90 years due to several critical reasons. First, the burden of PC caused by smoking is most severe in this age group. As the research results show, the mortality rate and DALY rate are the highest in the 90–95 age group. This indicates that, despite the overall downward trend, the health risks in this particular population remain serious and require special attention. Second, with the intensification of the global trend of population aging, the proportion of the population aged 90 and above is gradually increasing. The health issues of this group will pose greater challenges to the public health system. Tobacco control measures targeting this age group will not only help to reduce the burden of PC but may also have a positive impact on the prevention and treatment of other chronic diseases related to smoking. Third, the formulation and implementation of tobacco control policies should have a population - wide perspective, covering all stages from adolescence to old age. Tobacco control measures targeting men aged 90 and above can serve as an important part of the overall tobacco control strategy and contribute to maximizing health benefits across the entire population.

As life expectancy continues to increase in many regions, the proportion of the population in the oldest age groups is also growing. This demographic shift can lead to a higher burden of age-related diseases such as PC. The increased prevalence of PC in the 90–95 age group can be partly attributed to the longer lifespan of individuals in these cohorts, which allows for the accumulation of risk factors over time, including prolonged exposure to smoking. It is important to acknowledge potential diagnostic biases in the oldest age group. Underdiagnosis of PC in the oldest old can occur due to multiple comorbidities and limited access to healthcare services. These biases can affect the reported burden of PC in this age group. For instance, elderly patients with multiple health issues may not undergo the same level of diagnostic scrutiny as younger individuals, leading to an underestimation of the true burden of PC. Additionally, the management of PC in the oldest old often prioritizes palliative care over aggressive treatment, which can influence the reported mortality and DALYs associated with the disease. Furthermore, the concept of mortality selection should be considered. Individuals who survive to very old ages may have a selection bias towards healthier individuals, but those who develop PC in this age group may have more aggressive disease or higher mortality rates due to the interaction of multiple risk factors. Comorbidities also play a significant role in the health outcomes of the oldest old. The presence of multiple chronic conditions can complicate the diagnosis and treatment of PC, leading to higher morbidity and mortality. Limited access to healthcare services further exacerbates these issues, as older individuals may not receive timely or appropriate care for their conditions.

Comparing our findings with existing literature, several studies have also noted a decline in smoking-related health burdens in various contexts49,50. However, the focus on the specific subgroup of old men and the detailed breakdown by SDI regions adds a new dimension. Our identification of the contrasting trends in high and low-middle SDI regions challenge the assumption of a uniform global improvement and aligns with broader socioeconomic health disparities research, which has shown that health gains are not evenly distributed across different economic strata.

Several potential biological mechanisms existed behind the relationships between smoking and PC among OM. Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and N - nitrosamines, which can induce genetic mutations in prostate cells51,52. These mutations disrupt the normal cell cycle regulation, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and the development of cancerous lesions53. Additionally, smoking may impair the immune system’s ability to detect and eliminate precancerous cells, further facilitating the progression of prostate cancer. For instance, smoking has been shown to heighten the inflammatory response, a key component of the innate immune system, while simultaneously impairing the adaptive immune mechanisms, including the activity of B cells and regulatory T cells54. This dual impact creates a more permissive environment for cancer development. Previous study found that smoking not only has immediate effects on the immune system but also long-term consequences that persist even after smoking cessation55. Researches revealed that the inflammatory response returns to normal levels quickly after quitting, but the impact on adaptive immunity, particularly involving B cells and regulatory T cells, can persist for 10 to 15 years56. This long-term effect is attributed to epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, which can modify the expression of genes involved in immune cell metabolism57. Moreover, the chronic exposure to these harmful substances over the years, especially in the aging population, exacerbates the risk. As individuals age, their biological repair mechanisms weaken, making them more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of smoking58,59.

The public health implications of our study are profound. Our research underscores the critical necessity for the development and implementation of targeted smoking cessation programs or tobacco control policies, such as increased taxes on tobacco products, advertising bans, and smoke-free laws, specifically aimed at older men. This vulnerability is further exacerbated in low-middle SDI regions, where the burden of smoking-related PC among OM is not only substantial but also increasing at an alarming rate. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities in health, a critical issue that has long been recognized but remains inadequately addressed in many parts of the world. SES is a strong determinant of health, and individuals living in low-middle SDI regions often face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, including financial constraints, limited availability of healthcare facilities, and inadequate health education. These disparities contribute to higher smoking rates and poorer health outcomes in these regions. Therefore, policymakers should consider allocating more resources to improve healthcare access and preventive services in lower SDI areas. This includes investing in infrastructure to enhance the availability and quality of healthcare facilities, training healthcare professionals to provide culturally competent and effective smoking cessation interventions, and implementing public health campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting. Furthermore, addressing socioeconomic disparities in health requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond healthcare access. It involves addressing the underlying social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and employment opportunities. By improving socioeconomic conditions in lower SDI regions, we can create a more favorable environment for health promotion and disease prevention. For example, providing better education and employment opportunities can empower individuals to make healthier lifestyle choices, including avoiding smoking and seeking timely medical care. Additionally, improving access to nutritious food, safe housing, and recreational facilities can contribute to overall health and well-being.

our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the GBD data relies on various data sources with different levels of quality and completeness, which may introduce some uncertainties in the estimates. The accuracy of the burden estimates is contingent upon the quality of the underlying data, and variations in data collection methods across different regions can lead to inconsistencies in the reported figures. Second, our study is an ecological study conducted at the population level, and thus it may be subject to ecological fallacy. The findings at the population level may not necessarily reflect individual-level associations, and caution should be exercised when inferring individual-level effects from population-level data. Third, due to limitations in data accessibility, the burden of PC attributable to other factors, such as comorbidities, genetic predispositions, or environmental exposures, was not explored in this study. The interplay between smoking and other risk factors in the development of PC is complex, and the absence of detailed individual-level data limits our ability to fully elucidate these relationships. Lastly, the GBD data may not fully capture the nuances of healthcare access and utilization, which can significantly influence the observed burden of disease. Variations in healthcare systems, screening practices, and treatment availability can affect the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of PC, and these factors were not accounted for in our analysis. Future studies could benefit from more detailed individual-level data to further explore the complex interactions between smoking, aging, and other risk factors with PC development among OM.

Our study, as the first to utilize the latest GBD 2021 database to examine the smoking-attributed burden of PC among OM, revealed a complex landscape of the global PC burden attributable to smoking among this population, with a global decline masking enduring regional disparities and a severe burden in the older age group. The findings call for tailored public health interventions and underscore the need to address socioeconomic inequalities in health related to PC among OM. Addressing these issues requires concerted efforts to implement tailored tobacco control strategies, reduce socioeconomic disparities, enhance healthcare access and quality, and continuously monitor and evaluate progress. As the global population continues to age, understanding and mitigating the impact of smoking on PC among this vulnerable population will be crucial for achieving global health equity.
