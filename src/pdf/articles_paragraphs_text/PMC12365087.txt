As a result of an error during figure assembly an incorrect image for internal reference strip tubulin blot was used in Figure 2A.

The correct Figure2and accompanying legend appear below.

Overexpression of DACT1 inhibition of cell growth and clonogenicity in 3AO cell line. (a) Representative Western blots of negative control-transfected (NC) and DACT1-transfected 3AO cells (DACT1), a typical type I EOC cell line with clear genetic background which arises from a patient with primary mucinous adenocarcinoma. α-tubulin was used as the loading control (****P < 0.0001). (b) The level of DACT1 mRNA expression in 3AO-DACT1 cells and 3AO-NC cells was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (**P < 0.01). (c) Growth curve of 3AO-DACT1 cells and 3AO-NC cells (p < 0.05, paired t test). Cell numbers were assessed by MTT assay from days 0 to 7. (d) and (e) The effect of DACT1 overexpression on 3AO cell colony formation. 3AO-DACT1 or 3AO-NC were incubated for 12 days and colonies of over 50 cells were counted after staining with crystal violet. (***P < 0.001). (f) The effect of DACT1 on 3AO cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry (**P < 0.01). All the experiment was repeated at least three times.
