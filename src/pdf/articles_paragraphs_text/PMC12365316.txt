This study presents an analysis of the morphology of sand particles and their contacts using high-resolution microcomputer tomography (CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raw 3D images are filtered, binarized, and smoothed to distinguish the granular space from the void space. The 3D granular space is segmented via an advanced adaptive watershed algorithm. The grain segmentation is used for contact detection and contact network extraction. The topography of each grain is diverse, fascinating, and shaped by a landscape of ridges and basins. This topography is reflected in the way the grains come into contact. Unlike the common conception of point contacts, we observe contacts over large surface areas, concave-like contacts due to ridge-basin interactions, and doughnut-like contacts due to incomplete contact between high ridges and deep basins. Although most of the interactions are due to a single contact, a significant number of multiple contact interactions are observed. SEM images show two key features: First, the sand surfaces are not quartz-clean but are coated with clay particles. Second, the basins are not empty but are partially filled with silt particles that are cemented with clay. This is a comprehensive experimental investigation to determine the basis for advanced contact models of the micromechanical investigation of the strength of sand aggregates and wave propagation herein. The proposed micro- and nanocharacterization of contact morphologies paves the way for future investigations of contact interaction in granular materials on Earth and beyond.

Sand dunes are common landscape features in many environments on Earth and other planetary bodies awaiting exploitation and colonization. These massive and fascinating landforms result from self-organized patterns of particles under the action of wind forces. On Earth, dunes are formed on large sand seas in the Sahara, Arabia, Central Asia, Australia, and southern Africa1. Sand dunes on a planet indicate the presence of rock sediments, fundamental for space agriculture, and atmosphere, necessary for the establishment of basic conditions for life. The subtle suggestion of the presence of sand and atmosphere in Mars and hence the possible formation of dunes in the Red Planet is credited to Carl Sagan in 19692. Seven years later, these hypotheses were confirmed by the Viking mission that observed windblown dust on Mars despite its tenuous atmosphere3. In spite of the lack of a persistent atmosphere, other planetary bodies such as Pluto4and Titan (Saturn’s Moon)5have dunes as part of their unique landscapes.

In the planetary context, sand generally refers to solid inorganic particles that are derived from the weathering of rocks6. The sand deposition process that creates the dunes is dominated bysaltation: the wind is sufficiently strong to lift surface particles and create ballistic trajectories. The lifted particles then impact the granular bed that produces asplash, leading to liberation of new particles7. Surface particles are involved in persistent granular avalanches, so they are subjected to intermittent shearing motion dominated by interparticle forces. The nature of these forces is poorly understood. The use of Hertzian models for elastic contact between spherical particles is a common assumption6. However, it is generally accepted that surface roughness and nonsphericity play an important role in contact interaction. Due to the complex interaction between non-spherical particles, two emerging phenomena are observed when granular materials are sheared: the development of shear bands that appear as stratification structures in the slip zone of dunes8, and the intricate correlation of contact forces that creates filamentary structures known as force chains9. The peculiar dynamics of dunes are not a result of individual grains, but an emerging phenomenon resulting from a collective interaction of grains and fluid that need to be decoded by a proper contact interaction between individual particles.

Apart from these emerging phenomena, much less is known about the booming produced by avalanches in the dunes, a peculiar sound emitted by the sand, similar to musical instruments due to the presence of characteristic harmonics10. There is still no consensus on the origin of these sounds. Is it the shape of the individual grains? Or is it the way they interact? Attempts to replicate this sound in experimental setups have suggested that the booming comes from a synchronized motion of the grains11. A proper mathematical model of this phenomenon requires a better description of how individual grains come in contact, and a framework that allows the input of contact morphometry to more realistic contact interaction models.

In this paper, we cement the basis for a full micro- and nanomechanical investigation of emerging behavior of sand dunes by a nanoscale characterization of the particle and contact morphology of sand particles on Arabian dunes. As controls for the experiments, monodisperse and polydisperse packings of spheres are used. First, a novel workflow for the identification of contacts between individual grains is developed using advanced techniques for watershed segmentation of 3D microcomputer tomography images. To overcome the limitations of X-ray dispersion near the contact areas, the investigation was performed with different resolutions and complemented with nanoscale scanning electron surface microscopy. We provide a new method for the full characterization of sand grains in Saudi landscapes, which can be extrapolated to the analysis of other terrestrial and extraterrestrial grains in future explorations.

The analysis of the contact network created by loose granulates is performed here on the basis of microcomputer tomography images of Arabian sand grains and packings of spherical particles. Images of aroundvoxels were produced with voxel resolutions varying fromto, see details in the Materials and Methods Section. Identification of contacts between grains in 3D grayscale images is implemented through a systematic workflow comprising the following steps: grayscale image filtering, Otsu binarization, adaptive watershed segmentation, contact detection, and contact network extraction. While our workflow shares similarities with existing methods for inter-particle contact tracking12, it is specifically designed to characterize the morphology of the contacts. Our method for contact resolution is described below.

Filtering:Median filtering with a two-voxel window is applied to remove low-wavelength noise while preserving the sharpness of the void-granular interface:.

Masking:Binarization requires the distribution of gray intensities to form a bimodal histogram in which bright voxels represent the foreground and dark voxels the background. Areas of the image that are not scanned creates a zero-intensity peak in the histogram . A mask containing only the scanned area is created to remove this zero-intensity peak:.

Binarization:The histogram within the masked area is used to apply Otsu’s binarization, which assigns to each voxel a value offalse(granular material) ortrue(void). The Otsu method is an effective and unbiased technique for separating foreground and background voxels on the basis of the histogram of the voxel intensities13. The input of the algorithm is the grayscale image with a bimodal intensity histogram; and the output is the binarized image:.

Segmentation:This step converts the binary imageBinto a topographic hypersurface, where intensity values represent elevation. Here, the elevation of each voxel is its distance from the image boundary. The watershed algorithm then identifies thecatchment basinson this hypersurface, allowing the separation of adjacent particles according to their boundaries14. The output is a label matrix where each value corresponds to the voxels of an individual grain:. The binary image of the separated grains is.

Output:The binary images of the contacts are obtained by identifying voxels of the image that do not belong to any domain of the segmentation:.

Here, we present a comparison between traditional and advanced watershed segmentation methods to identify individual grains. The preliminary step for segmentation is image filtering. Raw grayscale images often contain noise and artifacts that may introduce spurious elements into the contact network. Low-wavelength noise can also make distinguishing granular voxels from void voxels difficult. To enhance image quality, the process begins by filtering the grayscale image. A median smoothing filter with a variance of two voxel lengths effectively removes low-wavelength noise and maintains the sharpness of the boundary between the grains and voids. This will use avoxel window for filtering that improves the contrast while avoiding smoothing of small details of the boundaries. The grain image before and after filtering is shown in Figures1(a) and (b), with the corresponding intensity histograms in Fig.1Right. The filtering step improves the histogram of the voxel intensities, making it easier to distinguish granular voxels from voids. Since the histogram of intensities consists of two well-defined peaks, the Otsu method effectively classifies grain voxels astrueand void voxels asfalse. To facilitate watershed segmentation, 3D holes within the grains are filled in the binary image. The binary image is shown in Fig.1(c).

Left: The process for 3D image segmentation starts from a gray-scale image (a) that is filtered (b) and then binarized (c). The benchmark tests for the segmentation of the binary image include the standard watershed segmentation (d), the modified algorithm where local maxima are morphologically dilated (e), and the advanced adaptive watershed algorithm where the dilation is scaled to the object size (f). These images correspond to a slide of the 3D image whose diameter is 5 mm. Right: 3D Histogram of intensities of the gray image before and after filtering.

Watershed segmentation converts the binary image into a labeled image, separating individual grains. First, the binary image is converted to a distance map. This map is a topographic hypersurface where the intensity of each voxel corresponds to its distance from the nearest boundary. The standard watershed algorithm identifies the local maxima of the distance map and then calculates the catchment basins of each maxima. The basins allow for the separation of adjacent particles according to their boundaries14. Figure1d shows the result of the standard watershed segmentation. The original algorithm suffers from grain oversegmentation. To reduce oversegmentation, the local maxima are dilated by a certain amount, and the dilated areas are defined asmarkers. Markers are used as seed areas to define the catchment basins. Figure1e shows the results of the watershed segmentation with markers. Regardless of the dilation chosen, the results show significant instances of adjacent grains that are not effectively separated as well as instances of oversegmentation. The IPSDK algorithm provides an improved adaptive watershed algorithm, originally inspired by the Munch algorithm15and implemented in a robust and computationally efficient way16. In the algorithm, the dilation of local maxima is proportional to its maximum height, and the basins are calculated from the resulting markers. The IPSDK algorithm is well-suited for separating non-convex grains of varying sizes. Figure1f demonstrates that the adaptive watershed segmentation effectively separates grains, including those with concave shapes, and minimizes oversegmentation. This is achieved using a single control parameter: the dilation ratio.

The IPDSK adaptive segmentation method is first applied to a high-resolution grayscale image of a sand sample, shown in Fig.2(a). After binarization, the sample is segmented using the adaptive watershed algorithm, leading to the labeled image shown in Fig.2(b). Each color represents an individual grain. The labeled image is mathematically represented as a 3D matrix of unsigned integers that is defined as thelabel matrix.

Computer workflow designed to extract contact networks from a CT scan of sand. The gray image in (a) is binarized and segmented, resulting in the labeled image (b) where the grains are separated by colors. Then, a neighbor detection algorithm converts the labeled image into a network (c). The network can be reduced to an undirected graph that removes its geometry and retains only the topology: node indices and connectivity. The diameter and height of the sample is 5 mm and the image containsvoxels.

The segmentation algorithm separates the grains by a distance of one voxel. Thus, for the detection of contacts, each voxel of thelabel matrixis morphologically dilated by two voxels, and the labels in the dilated regions are used to detect the neighborhood. If there are two labels in the dilated region, they correspond to the labels of two particles in contact, and the pair of particle indexes are stored in an array of all pair indexes. These indexes are used to define anundirected graphas follow: all particles indexes are thenodesof this graph, and all pairs of indexes of particles in contact correspond to theedgesof the graph. The contact detection is based on grain dilation. To verify that the results do not depend on the dilation radius, we compared the graph obtained with the two-voxel and three-voxel dilation and verified that there are no changes in the graph using both dilation values. We also verify that the coordination number of the graph remains unchanged after reducing the scan resolution.

The contact network database includes particle indexes, pair indexes of particles in contact, and the centroids of the particles and contacts. Thegraphand thelabel matrixobtained from the previous steps are used to calculate thecontact label matrix. This matrix is calculated as follows: Each indexkof the edge list is defined by the pair indexesiandjof the two grains in contact. The images of the two grains are morphologically dilated by two voxels. Then, the intersection between the dilated image defines the image of the contact. The voxels within this intersection are assigned the indexkof the edge. Then, a contact label matrix is obtained after the indexes’ edges are assigned to all contact images. The list of centroids of the particles is obtained from the connected components of thelabel matrix, and the list of contact centroids is obtained from the connected components of thecontact label matrix. The graph and centroids define the contact network database. Fig.2(c) is the graphical representation of the contact network; each sphere represents a node of the network and is located at the centroid of the particle. The link between two nodes indicates that the two particles are in contact.

The contact label matrix for the high-resolution image of the sand is shown in Fig.3. The image has been conveniently split into two parts; both shows the label image of the contacts and one part shows the binary image of the grains. The contacts are the interfaces between the interacting grains. The contacts have a diverse morphology in terms of radius, curvature, and concavity.

Image rendering of grains and contacts in a detailed sand sample. The image is split into two, the gray domains represent the grains resolved by the watershed image segmentation. The colored patches are the images of the contacts interfaces, obtained by morphologically dilating the grains and resolving the overlap between the dilated images.

Statistical analysis of the morphology of the contacts between sand grains is performed by comparing it to a random packing of spherical particles. Segmented images of three packings are shown in Fig.4: a random packing of monodisperse spheres, a packing of polydisperse spheres, and a large-scale image of sand particles. The detailed sand image in Fig.2is used to obtain high-resolution images of the contacts between grains, whereas the other three images are used to perform statistical analyzes of the morphology of the contacts. The segmented images are used to calculate the contact network and the contact label matrices in each sample. Each index of the contact label matrix corresponds to the image of an individual contact between two grains.

Results of the grain segmentation of four different samples (a) Monodisperse packing of spheres, (b) polydisperse packing of spheres, (c) Arabian sand sample. The cubic samples have a side of 5 mm, 7.5 mm, and 10 mm and the images contain,, andvoxels.

Some typical morphologies of contact interfaces are shown in detail in Fig.5. In the case of spherical grains, the contact is typically disk-shaped, Fig.5(a). We should notice that the complex diffraction patterns of the X-rays affect the resolution of such small contacts, and the retrieved contact radius is larger than in reality. This is verified by comparing two analyzes, one on a 5-mm diameter sample with resolution 5m per voxel, Fig.5(a), and the second on a 2-mm diameter sample with 2m per voxel,  Fig.5(a). For such small contacts, the resulting contact area is proportional to the image resolution. From the high-resolution analysis, we conclude that the contacts are almost point-like, with the averaged contact radius around 5% the averaged particle radius.

From left to right. Contact and pair of interacting spheres; multi-contact and pair of sand particles; doughnut-like contact and pair of sand-particles. (a) For spherical particles, the contacts is disk shaped and their diameter attains the inherent surface roughness of the non-perfect spherical grains. The apparent area is due to the X-ray diffraction, and shown in the images forper pixel (a), andper pixel (a) For sand particles, the contacts are more diverse, with many cases of disconnected areas (b) or large surface multiple-connected contacts (c).

Fortunately for us, this limitation is absent in sand particles, where less than 10% of the contacts have a radius less than 20% of the particle radius. For sand particles, the morphology is much more diverse, and some grains interact via multiple contacts; see Fig.5(b) or doughnut-shaped contacts; see Fig.5(c). Interestingly, intuitive cases of contacts between two convex parts of each grain surface are rare. When a sand grain meets, typically a convex part of one of the grains gets in contact with a concave part of the other grain, creating contacts with significant curvature, multiple contacts, or multiple connected (doughnut-shaped) contacts.

An important component of the analysis is the quantification of the topology of the contact network. The topology can be obtained from the undirected graph of the network, which encodes only the information related to the connectivity of the grains. There are several topology metrics for the undirected graph, such as the path length and the coordination number, also called the order of the nodes. The path length is the average distance between two nodes in terms of edge counts. Since the graphs of all the samples are regular random graphs, the path length is proportional to the size of the network, and no significant differences are observed. We concentrate here only on the coordination number, which is also known as the degree of the node, i.e., the number of grains connected with a particular grain.

The coordination number statistics are shown in Fig.6for the three samples: sand, monodisperse spheres, and polydisperse spheres. In the random packing of monodisperse spheres, the coordination number varies between 1 and 10. For polydisperse spheres, the distribution of the coordination number is slightly broader 1 and 12. The packing of the sand particles has a much broader distribution of coordination number, within 1 and 18. For all cases, the most likely coordination number is very similar, approximately.

Left: distribution of the coordination number for the graphs extracted from the three different samples: monodisperse spheres, polydisperse spheres, and well-sorted sands. Right: Statistics of both particle and contacts for the three granulates (monospheres, polyspheres, and sand). The statistics for the particles are (a) normalized radius, (b) aspect ratio, (c), and solidity, The same statistic are shown for the contacts in (d-f). The particle/contact radii are normalized to their average value.

Here, we perform a statistical analysis of the morphology of the particles. This analysis is performed on the connected components of the binarized label matrix:. We start with the normalized radii of the particles, which is the particle radius divided by the average value over all grains. This value is obviously one for the monodisperse packing of spheres, as shown in Fig.6(a). For the polydisperse packing of spheres, the radius varies between 0.75 and 1.25. For sand grains, the particle radii extend in the range of. For natural sand grains in the slip zone of a dune, the grain size distribution is bimodal with two distinguished peaks. The second peak, located approximately 0.3 mm in Fig.6(a), is less pronounced than in the original sand sample. This is because the small particles were removed from our sample to minimize the unavoidable segregation when the bimodal sample is poured into the container used for the CT-scanning.

The second important statistic of the particle is the aspect ratio, which is trivially very close to 1 of the spherical packing but varies in the rangefor the sand particles. We also calculate the solidity of each particle. Solidity is a quantitative measure of the convexity of a three-dimensional object within a digital image. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of the object to the volume of its convex hull. In theory, the solidity of a spherical particle should be one. In our analysis, the solidity for spherical particles is slightly lower than one, due to the surface irregularities. For sand grains, the solidity varies in the rangedue to the significant nonconvex topography of the grains.

Here, we conduct a comparative study of the contact morphology statistics using three variables: normalized contact radius, contact aspect ratio, and contact solidity. Considering how the morphology of contacts relates to the morphology of the parent grains, we compared their respective morphological statistics. The image of the contacts is obtained as, whereBis the binarized image andLthe label image of the particles. Each connected component of the binary imagecorresponds to the image of one contact. The morphology of each contact is given by the radius of the contact normalized by the sample average, the aspect ratio, and the solidity. In evaluating the error produced by the resolution of the image, we compare the contact statistics with the results of a high-resolution image. Quantifying this error is limited by the number of voxels that can be processed in the image analysis. Keeping a constant number of voxels, the scan volume must be reduced as the scan resolution increases. Consequently, high-resolution images yield fewer contacts. This limitation is overcome by only comparing the main statistics of the distributions: mean and standard deviation are affected by image resolution. We confirm that these statistics do not change with increasing image resolution. However, the average contact radius is highly sensitive to image resolution. It is recommended to calculate the average contact radius using different resolutions, then plot the value against the voxel size (resolution) and interpolate the value to voxel size equal to zero. In this paper, we normalize the contact radius by its average, so that the normalized contact radius is resolution independent.

The probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the normalized radius, aspect ratio, and solidity of the contacts are shown in Fig.6(d). As expected, sand particles exhibit a broad distribution of contact radii, while the contact radius distribution for the spherical packing is much narrower. The aspect ratio for spherical particles is close to one, while it varies in the rangefor sand particles. In all cases, the contact solidity is less than one, confirming that the contacts are nonconvex. Furthermore, the contact statistics are similar in both spherical packings, suggesting that polydispersity has a minimal impact on contact morphology. A comparison of the particle radii distribution in Fig.6(a) with the contact radius distribution reveals the extent to which the contact radius distribution is influenced by the particle radius distribution. Although the particle radius distribution in the monodisperse packing is narrow, the corresponding contact radius distribution is broader. The normalized contact radius distribution is governed more by the sphere roughness and contact force distribution than by the particle radius. A similar effect is observed with sand particles: The bimodal particle radius distribution contrasts with the unimodal contact radius distribution, suggesting that the contact radius depends more on surface roughness than the particle size. In terms of aspect ratio, it is observed that the values for the contact are directly inherited from those of the particles.

It is also interesting to compare the particle solidity in Fig.6(c) to the contact solidity in Fig.6(f). Solidity is defined as the ratio between the volume of the image and that of its convex hull. For spherical particles, the solidity is slightly lower than 1 due to surface irregularities. These irregularities cause the contact solidity to be significantly lower than 1. For the packing of spheres, the contact solidity peaks around 0.45. This reduction in solidity from particles to contacts suggests that contacts form preferentially in areas where the particle surface deviates from a perfect sphere. Thus, contact solidity appears to be determined more by surface roughness than by overall particle shape. For sand particles, the particle solidity peaks around 0.9, while the contact solidity peaks around 0.6, reflecting the relatively high concavity of these contacts. Grain surfaces exhibit some degree of concavity, deviating from a perfectly convex shape. When grains are poured into a container, contacts tend to form between concave regions on one grain and convex regions on another. Contacts between two convex surfaces are less common because such configurations are energetically less favorable; they do not minimize the system’s potential energy as effectively. To illustrate this, consider a ball on a rough surface: it will settle at locations corresponding to local minima in the surface topography, where the potential energy is minimized. Similarly, grains are unlikely to form contacts solely at local maxima, creating convex-convex contacts. This principle governs the arrangement of particles under gravity, favoring contacts that maximize surface conformity and minimize potential energy.

The main difference between contacts in sand packings and those in spherical packings is the diversity of contact morphology. In spheres, the contacts have an aspect ratio close to one, and the distributions of the contact radius and solidity are very narrow. This is different from that for sand particles, where the distributions of all metrics are much broader. Examples of typical and extreme morphological metrics are shown in Fig.7. Contacts with low solidity belong to disconnected contact areas of the same particles pair; contacts with high solidity are point-like contacts. The stereotypical contacts have a solidity of approximatelyand have quite an irregular geometry. For the contact radius, the extremely low cases are point-like contacts, and the extremely large cases are large contact areas between highly non-spherical grains. These stereotypical values correspond to contacts with regular and curved shapes that result from the contact between a convex area of one of the grains and the concave grain of the other. For the aspect ratio, the point contacts correspond to extremely low aspect ratios, and large aspect ratios correspond to contacts between strongly non-spherical grains. The stereotypical aspect ratio corresponds to contacts between irregular areas of the particles. In general, point-like contacts between sand grains are rare, and multiple contacts or contacts with extremely elongated or irregular shapes are rare. The typical contacts between sand particles have radii on the order of particle radius and are warped, resulting in a relatively low solidity compared to spherical grains.

Examples of contacts with extreme (right-left columns) and average (middle column) morphometrics. Three metrics are accounted: solidity (top row), normalized contact radius (second row), and aspect ratio (bottom row). The solidity is calculated from the convex hull polyhedron that is what one get if the contact volume is wrapped by a rubber membrane, see top row. The solidity is calculated as the relationship between the volume of contact image and the volume of the convex hull.

While CT scans allow the detection of the surface area between particles, their resolution is not sufficient for visualization of the small-scale roughness details along the contact area. In particular, the detection of the contact surface between spherical particles is limited by the dispersion of the X-ray around the small contact between the particles. To resolve the contact interaction between the particles, it is necessary to know whether the particles are in contact along the whole contact area detected by the CT scan or whether the interaction results from localized contact points on individual nanoscale size contacts. To solve this problem, visualization of the surface of the grain at the nanoscale resolution is necessary.

To achieve nanoscale visualization of the surface of the grains, we use scanning electron microscopy. Grain surface images are shown in Fig.8. We notice that the surface of the sand grains is not naked, but instead they are coated by clay aggregates, The presence of aggregates is especially abundant in the grain valleys. These valleys are partially covered with silt particles cemented by clay aggregates. Cemented clay aggregates consist of spaghetti-shaped structures, technically known as palygorskite17. Note that clay aggregates are uniformly distributed along grain surfaces, creating a uniform coating of the quartz substrate for each grain. This is different from what is observed in the surface steel ball particles, where the impurities of the order of one micrometer are rather scattered along the surface.

SEM scans of sand grains on a region of their flat surface (a-c) and around one of their craters (d-f). The squares represent the magnifications of the images. The scales are 1 mm left,center, andright. The surface of the grains is coated by clay particles. The basins are partially filled with silt particles cemented with clay.

The main effect of clay coating will be on the contact stiffness between the grains. Bare sand grains would have a contact stiffness dominated by the high bulk stiffness of quartz (8,000 MPa). However, the clay coating on the grain surface would create nanocontacts that result from the interaction between the surface clay aggregate and, in some cases, clay-quartz interactions. Since the bulk stiffness of clay is much lower than that of quartz (0.1-10 MPa), it is expected that the contact stiffness is significantly lower than that expected by two bare quartz solids interacting by surface forces (the typical modulus of elasticity of sand isMPa).

While SEM scans clearly reveal nanoscale surface features, micro-CT cannot directly resolve them. Instead, their presence is indirectly inferred from subtle changes in X-ray attenuation and boundary blurring. This limitation likely explains the strong dependence of contact area measurements on scan resolution. Therefore, reliable measurements of contact areas require supplementary data from higher-resolution techniques like nano-CT or synchrotron-based imaging.

We have analyzed the morphology of contacts in spherical and non-spherical packings subjected only to the loads produced by their own weights. We have found that the contacts between the sand grains are not point-like contact but typically have a contact radius comparable to the radius of the particle. This is different from the assumption in contact mechanics theory that the contacts between particles have a very small area compared to the surface area of the particles. Point-like contacts in particles that are not pressed with each other are the starting point of contact mechanical theories such as Hertz theory. The significant large contact areas lead to effects on the particle interaction that is usually neglected in the particle-based simulations, such as the significant of bending and rolling moments in the contact interaction.

In light of these results, we need to reconsider the assumption of using Hertz theory in contact mechanics. Its applicability is rather questionable even in spherical particles, since the particles chose to create contacts between the most irregular areas of their surfaces. In nonspherical grains, the contact is typically created by the interaction between a concave part of a grain and the convex part of the other grain, forming a contact with significant curvature. Thus, in addition to normal, frictional, bending, and torsional strength, it is probably necessary to add the geometric strength to the contact to account for these curvatures. For a more realistic model of interaction among grains, the contact should not be regarded as a point where contact forces are transmitted. Instead, the contact should be considered as a two-dimensional surface that allows transmission of contact forces and moments. An additional effect is expected as a result of the curvature of the contact area, which should provide additional strength at the contact, known as geometrical strength. The additional strength on curve surfaces, such as shells and membranes, is well known in structural mechanics and is exploited to minimize materials by optimizing the geometry of modern lightweight structures18. In a similar fashion, nature may choose to create contacts between grains with a certain curvature to optimize the stability of granular structures.

In conclusion, we have presented a method for high-resolution CT image processing to extract the morphology of individual contacts in granular materials. The method circumvents common challenges such as the limitations on voxel resolution, X-ray diffraction patterns, oversegmentation of the watershed method, and contact detection. We found that slight nonconvexity deviations from spherical geometries are amplified in the morphology of the contact between them, leading to contact with low solidity and relatively large contact areas. For nonspherical sand particles, the contact morphology is extremely diverse in terms of contact areas, aspect ratio, and nonconvexity. Stereotypical contacts between sand particles have a contact radius ofthe average grain radius, a relatively low aspect ratio, and low solidity due to irregular boundaries and warping. The contact morphology significantly deviates from the assumption of contact mechanics, which assumes that contacts have a contact area much smaller than the particle area and can therefore be considered as point-like particles. Our statistics suggest that the interaction between non-spherical particles should account for significant contact moments, both bending and rolling. In addition, the significant curvature of the contacts in sand particles suggests that both materials and geometrical strength need to be accounted for to model the resistance of the contact areas.

Our analysis of contact statistics, using scan resolution-independent variables, offers robust insights into the morphology of granular materials. However, we found that the average contact radius is significantly affected by scan resolution. In spherical packings, reducing the scan resolution from/ voxel to/ voxel reduced the measured average contact radius from 15% to 5% of the average particle radius. This is due to nanoscale surface features observed in SEM scans but unresolved by conventional CT scans. To accurately capture this parameter, future research should employ higher-resolution techniques, such as nano-CT or synchrotron-based imaging19More research is also needed to determine how contact resolution varies across different geomaterials and imaging techniques. Addressing these challenges will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of contact mechanics in granular materials.

The process of obtaining contact morphology involves producing 3D grayscale images from CT X-ray scans and processing these images using Gaussian filtering, Otsu binarization, mathematical morphology, adaptive segmentation, and extraction of contacts network. The following sections cover the processing of the sand samples and the experimental acquisition of the raw images.

Sand samples were collected from the slip side of dunes near King Fahd International Airport in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The particle sizes follow a bimodal distribution with two well-defined peaks. The first peak lies aroundand corresponds to the distribution of fine particles, accounting forof the particles. The coarse grains account forof the particles whose size distribution peaks around. The samples were subjected to a careful preparation process involving sieving with two vibratory sieve shakers (AS 450 and AS 200 Basic by Retsch), rigorous cleaning with water, treatment with a 15% concentration of hydrochloric acid, thorough washing with distilled water, and meticulous drying in an oven at 60for 24 hours. The selected samples were specifically coarse-grained sand to avoid size segregation in the micro-CT container and to ensure precise control over the grain size and compositional variation, as mineralogical heterogeneity increases with decreasing grain size in the studied samples.

A few grains were mounted and studied using Zeiss Gemini 450 (FESEM) equipment. The FESEM was equipped with a Secondary Electron Detector (SE). The system was manufactured by Zeiss, Germany. Before SEM analysis, the samples were coated withto make about 10nmcoatings on the grains using the Quorum sputter coater prior to SEM analysis. The analysis was carried out at a voltage of 5KVand probe currents of 98pA.

The samples were analyzed using the Xradia 620 Versa micro-CT scanner in different settings to obtain representative images. The samples were placed in 10-mm diameter cylindrical containers and mounted on a rotating stage to ensure stability during scanning. X-rays were directed at the samples and the transmitted rays were captured by a detector. The stage rotated incrementally, capturing projections at various angles until a full 360-degree rotation was completed. The collected projections were then processed by software to generate 3D and 2D images of the samples.

For the first set of sand samples, scanning was performed at a voltage of 140 kV and a power of 21 W, resulting in 3,901 projections. This scan had a field of view of approximately 4,762 square micrometers and a resolution of 4.69 micrometers per pixel. In contrast, the second set of sand samples was scanned at a voltage of 80 kV and a power of 10 W, producing 2,021 projections. This scan had a larger field of view, approximately 10,303 micrometers square, but with a lower resolution of 10.06 micrometers per pixel.

In addition, a set of glass beads with different radii was scanned in three segments using a resolution of 10.27m and an exposure time of 1 s. The scan was performed at 80 kV and 10 W with an LE3 filter, resulting in 1,601 projections. The field of view for this scan was approximately 10,516mtimes10,516m. The final scans involved metal beads, which were scanned in a single segment at a resolution of 9.81m, and an exposure time of 1.5 s. This scan used a higher voltage of 160 kV and 25 W with an HE6 filter. Like glass beads, 1,601 projections were obtained, covering a field of view of approximately 10,050times10,050. A high-resolution image of steel beads produced by placing them in a 2-mm container and using a resolution of 1.7m.
