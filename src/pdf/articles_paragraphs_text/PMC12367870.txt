Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SI-AKI) is a severe condition with limited therapeutic options, resulting in poor prognosis. Ferroptosis exacerbates the damage caused by SI-AKI, but the mechanisms regulating ferroptosis, especially those involving ubiquitination regulators, remain poorly understood. Here, we used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human kidney organoid (HKO) model to investigate ferroptosis in SI-AKI. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of control and LPS-treated HKOs revealed USP18 as the only upregulated ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) in response to LPS. Further investigations showed that depletion of USP18 significantly reduced ferroptosis in LPS-induced HKOs. To explore the mechanism underlying USP18’s pro-ferroptotic role, we screened four ferroptosis-related drivers and identified STING1 as the key interacting protein with USP18. Mechanistically, USP18 directly binds to STING1, deubiquitinates it, and prevents its proteasomal degradation in HKOs. Overexpression of STING1 in USP18-deficient HKOs exacerbated ferroptosis, indicating that STING1 is crucial for mediating USP18’s ferroptosis-promoting function in LPS-induced HKOs. Together, these findings establish that USP18-STING1 axis plays role in LPS-induced ferroptosis in HKOs, illuminating that targeting USP18-STING1 could provide neoteric therapeutic approach for treating SI-AKI.

Sepsis is a complex syndrome, caused by dysregulated immune response to infection, leading to multiorgan dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI) (Srdić et al.2024). It involves excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production, immune activation, and vascular disruption, impairing blood flow and damaging kidney tissue. Sepsis is the primary cause of AKI, affecting 60% of sepsis patients and accounting for 45% to 70% of all cases of AKI (Zarbock et al.2023). Additionally, 15–20% of sepsis-related AKI cases progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease (Murugan and Kellum2011).

Ferroptosis is a distinct type of programmed cell death triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. It differs from apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis (Li et al.2020). Increasing amounts of evidence has revealed the vital roles of ferroptosis in AKI development, including that triggered by sepsis (Ni et al.2022), and compounds that target ferroptosis have been shown to alleviate renal cellular and tissue injuries, exhibiting therapeutical potential in treating SI-AKI (Guo et al.2022; Qiu et al.2022). However, the mechanism controlling ferroptosis during SI-AKI occurrence and progression remains incompletely understood.

Ubiquitination is a vital protein modification that involves a succession of enzymatic steps (Damgaard2021; Liu et al.2020a). Conversely, deubiquitination, which removes ubiquitin chains from target proteins, is facilitated by deubiquitinates (Snyder and Silva2021). A proper ubiquitination-deubiquitination balance is critical in regulating protein stability and function (Sun et al.2020). Dysregulated ubiquitination regulators have been associated with SI-AKI. For instance, E3-ligase CHIP alleviates SI-AKI injury by ubiquitinating NLRP3 and accelerates its degradation (Zhang et al.2023). USP9X activates the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, thereby facilitating SI-AKI development by promoting inflammation and apoptosis (Gong et al.2024), while USP10 regulates the Sirt6-mediated Nrf2/ARE pathway, thereby attenuating kidney injury in an SI-AKI mouse model (Gao et al.2021). Yet, the function of many other ubiquitination regulators in SI-AKI, particularly those regulating ferroptosis, has not been elucidated.

Recent studies have illuminated the involvement of ubiquitination regulators in ferroptosis (Lu et al.2024). For example, ferroptosis is inhibited in gliomas, which is achieved through the promotion of GPX4’s K63-linked ubiquitination by TRIM26 (Wang et al.2023), while another E3 Ligase, MIB1, sensitizes lung cancer cells to ferroptosis by accelerating NRF2 degradation (Wang et al.2022). Additionally, USP11 represses ferroptosis by stabilizing NRF2 (Meng et al.2021), whereas USP7 promotes ferroptosis by activating p53/TfR1 pathway in rat cardiac tissue after I/R (Tang et al.2021). Nevertheless, the roles of other ubiquitination regulatory factors in ferroptosis and their target proteins in various biological processes remains to be explored.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) functions as a key pro-inflammatory agent in SI-AKI pathogenesis (Virzì et al.2022). LPS activates immune cells and inflammatory mediators and is broadly utilized in SI-AKI cellular and animal mouse models. However, interspecies differences and the complexity of the human immune microenvironment limit the accuracy of these models in replicating human kidney characteristics (Doi et al.2009; Pathak and Mayeux2010). To circumvent the shortcomings of traditional models, kidney organoids derived from hPSCs offer a promising alternative (Liu et al.2024; Romero-Guevara et al.2020). These organoids mimic renal tissue architecture, encompass diverse cell types, and allow high-throughput studies of renal function while eliminating confounding factors like hemodynamic changes and immune infiltration, making them an ideal tool for investigating SI-AKI pathogenesis (Zhang et al.2021a; Nunez-Nescolarde et al.2022).

In this study, we first generated human kidney organoids (HKOs) from hPSCs and treated them with LPS to establish a model of SI-AKI. We then performed RNA sequencing to investigate the underlying mechanisms of SI-AKI and identified USP18 as the only upregulated USP in LPS-induced HKOs. To assess the role of USP18, we depleted it in HKOs and examined its impact on LPS-induced ferroptosis, further verified the results through rescue experiments. Additionally, we screened potential substrates of USP18 and identified STING1 as its target in both HEK293T cells and HKOs. We further explored how USP18 regulates the ubiquitination and stability of STING1 in HKOs. Finally, we assessed whether STING1 mediates USP18’s effects on ferroptosis in LPS-treated HKOs.

To overexpress USP18 or STING1, their coding sequences were respectively cloned into the pcDNA3.3-HA or pLV2-CMV-FLAG-Puro vector, and the resulting plasmids were designated as HA-USP18 (USP18 OE) and Flag-STING1 (STING1 OE). For ZEB1 and BECN1 overexpression, their coding sequences were inserted into the pCMV-3 × FLAG-SV40-Neo and pLV3-CMV- 3 × FLAG-CopGFP-Puro backbone, respectively, leading to the plasmids of Flag-ZEB1 and Flag-BECN1. For USP18 knockdown, three shRNAs (shUSP18-1, shUSP18-2, and shUSP18-3) were inserted into pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vector and a non-specific shRNA (shNC) was used as the negative control. The His-tagged ubiquitin plasmid (His-Ub) was purchased from Wuhan Miaoling Biotechnology (China). All plasmids were sequenced before use to ensure their sequence accuracy. The lentivirus production and titer determination were performed by Anti-Hela Biotech (China). The virus multiplicity of infection (MOI) for knockdown assays was optimized to 50. Non-viral plasmid transfection was conducted by Lipofectamine 2000. The primer sequences are shown in Table1.

Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) H1 cells, cultured to 70% confluence, were digested with TrypLE™ Express (12,605–010, Gibco, USA) for 5 min. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in complete mTeSR™ 1 medium (85,850, STEMCELL, USA) with 10 μM Y-27632 (MedChemExpress, USA) (50,000 cells/mL). A 2 mL aliquot of the cell suspension was transferred to an ultralow attachment 6-well plate (Corning) and incubated overnight. The following day was designated as Day (D) −1, during which the medium was replaced with mTeSR™ 1 medium without Y-27632. On Day 0 (D0), the cells were cultured in APEL2 medium (05270, STEMCELL) with 8 μM CHIR99021 (HY-10182, MedChemExpress) for three days (D0-D3). This was followed by an induction phase (D4-D6) using APEL2 with 200 ng/mL FGF9 (10,262-HNAE, Sinobiological, China) and 1 μg/mL heparin (60351ES03, Yeasen, China). On Day 7 (D7), the developing HKOs were stimulated with 5 μM CHIR99021 for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in APEL2 containing 200 ng/mL FGF9 and 1 μg/mL heparin for an additional three days (D7-D10). Finally, the medium was switched to APEL2 with 1 μg/mL heparin, and the HKOs were harvested and characterized on Day 26 (D26).

Collect the HKOs into 24-well low-attachment plates. Then 500 μL of complete organoid medium containing 50 μL of a 1: 50 diluted lentiviral suspension (titer = 1 × 107) was added and mixed thoroughly, incubated for 24 h. Afterwards, the fresh culture medium with/without LPS was added for 24 h of cultivation, followed by the subsequent detection. The groupings of HKOs were: Mock, LPS, LPS + shNC, LPS + shUSP18. To conduct the rescue experiment using ferroptosis inhibitors, HKOs were handled with 50 μg/mL LPS and 0.25 μM Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) simultaneously for 24 h.

The morphology of HKOs was examined using an inverted bright-field microscope (Motic, China) equipped with a digital camera. The diameters of these HKOs were measured using the associated software. For each treatment group, the diameters of six HKOs were analyzed.

The ATP levels were assessed by a kit (S0027, Beyotime), following the manufacturer’s instruction using a Microplate Luminometer Orion II (Berthold Technologies GmbH, Germany).

HKOs were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before being processed into 5 μm frozen sections. The sections were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA (BP9700100, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for 1 h at RT. Then, they were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, including anti-human CK19 (10,712–1-AP, Proteintech, 1:500) or anti-human PODXL (RLM0526, Immunoway, 1:500). Afterwards, the sections were washed 3 times with PBST, each wash lasting 10 min. They were then incubated in dark at RT for 1 h with fluorescent secondary antibody solution (RS0011, Immunoway, 1:1000). Afterward, the sections were washed again with PBST, mounted using a DAPI-containing medium, and imaged using LMS 900 confocal microscope.

Organoids were collected and allowed to stand for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed by centrifugation. Agarose grooves were prepared, the organoid precipitate was aspirated and placed at the bottom of the groove, PBS was added and centrifuged for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, melted agarose was added to the organoid precipitate to coagulate at RT, and then it was fixed at 4 °C overnight. The agarose blocks containing organoid precipitates were treated in 70%, 80%, 90% and 95% ethanol for 1 h, 100% ethanol for 30 min, then placed in xylene for 5 min, treated twice, immersed in wax for 2 h at 60 °C, immersed in wax twice, then embedded into wax blocks and made into paraffin sections. The sections were immersed in xylene. After the wax on the sections was dissolved, the paraffin sections were immersed in absolute ethanol I-II for 5 min, respectively. The paraffin sections were rinsed with absolute ethanol for 20 s, and then the alcohol on the sections was rinsed off with running water. The slices were respectively stained in HE staining solution 1 for 3 min, HE staining solution 2 for 3 s, and HE staining solution 3 for 3 s followed by rapid water washing. Then slices were immersed in 85% ethanol, 95% ethanol, HE staining solution 4, absolute ethanol I-III, n-butyl alcohol, xylene I-II for 3 min, separately, and the slices were quickly dried and sealed with neutral gum.

Total RNA was isolated from HKOs using TRIzol and purified with the RaPure Total RNA Kit (R4011-02, Magen Biotech). For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of RNA was used as a template in conjunction with the All-in-One First-Strand SuperMix (EG15133S, NYBio, China). ChamQ SYBR Color qPCR Master Mix was applied to perform qPCR (Q431-02, Vazyme, China), with 18S ribosomal RNA serving as the endogenous control. Relative levels of gene were determined by 2−ΔΔCTmethod. Primers are provided in Table2.

Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (Beyotime). Equal amounts of denatured protein (10 μg) were loaded, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk (Beyotime) for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies, then incubated with the secondary antibody solution for 2 h. Protein signals were detected by ECL solution from Beyotime and visualized with a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Details of the antibodies used are provided in Table3.

Total RNA was extracted from mock- and LPS-treated HKOs (approximately 100 organoids per sample) using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Each sample yielded over 1 μg of total RNA, with RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) of ≥ 9.4. Libraries were prepared by TruSeq Stranded mRNA (PolyA +) kit, and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38.p13), and DEGs were identified using the R package ‘limma’. Genes with a log2 fold change (Log2FC) ≥ 1 and an adjustedP-value (padj) < 0.05 were considered markedly differentially expressed.

For GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, we utilized the R package ‘clusterProfiler’ (v4.14.4). To identify USPs whose expression is upregulated in LPS-induced HKOs, the DEGs with a Log2FC of > 0.59 and a padj of < 0.05 were selected to compare with 75 known USPs in the human genome.

Lists of ferroptosis markers and drivers were downloaded from FerrDb V2 (http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/current/), and their expression profiles were examined in our RNA-seq dataset. The expression matrix ofGSE154918were downloaded from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Only sepsis and healthy samples were used in this study. PCA was performed to assess sample homogeneity and consistency. Outlier samples identified through PCA (GSM4683603,GSM4683576andGSM4683568) were excluded from downstream analyses. Following the removal of outliers, both principal component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated high consistency and quality across samples. Differential expression analysis was performed using the methods described above.

HKOs were homogenized and lysed using RIPA buffer, centrifugated at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were collected. The levels of MDA, GSH, GSSG, and Fe2+were measured using the MDA (BC0020, Solarbio, China), the GSH/GSSG (S0053, Beyotime), and the Fe2+assay kit (E-BC-K881-M, Elabscience, USA), respectively. OD values were measured using FlexStation 3 microplate reader.

ROS levels were measured using DCF-DA kit (50101ES01, Yeasen). The HKOs were incubated with 10 μM DCF-DA at 37 °C for 20 min in dark, with gentle inversion at intervals. After incubation, the HKOs were washed with serum-free medium to remove unbound DCF-DA, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed using NovoCyte 1300 machine (Agilent, USA).

For co-IP, protein extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG beads (M8823, Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-HA BeyoMag™ Protein A + G magnetic beads (P2121-2 ml, Beyotime) under gentle agitation at RT for 2 h. After incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with wash buffer to eliminate non-specific protein binding. Following the wash steps, the beads were resuspended in 20 μL of elution buffer, and the proteins bound to the beads were eluted for further analysis by Western blotting.

His-STING1, GST-USP18, and GST proteins were sourced from Anti-Hela Biotech. To prepare the protein mixture, 20 mg of His-STING1 was combined with 20 mg of GST-USP18 or GST protein. An aliquot of the mixture was denatured and centrifuged for the input sample. The remaining mixture was incubated with 20 μL of Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE17-0756–01) for 6 h at 4 °C with gentle inversion. After that, the beads were pelleted and then washed five times with ice-cold PBS, followed by incubation with 80 μL of elution buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant containing the eluted proteins was collected, denatured, and analyzed by Western blotting.

THP-1 were pretreated with PMA (100 ng/mL) for 24 h to induce differentiation. The HKOs with UPS18 depletion were seeded into the lower chamber and the differentiated THP-1 were seeded into the upper chamber of the Transwell plates. A co-culture system with or without LPS was used to cover the upper and lower chambers for co-culture.

ELISA was performed using TNF-α (Elabscience, E-EL-H0109) and IL-1β (E-EL-H0149) kits to detect cytokine concentration. All procedures strictly followed the manufacturer’s guidance.

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v8). Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Each data point in the bar and dot plots represents the mean of biological triplicates and/or the average of technical triplicates.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The methods used to calculateP-values are specified in the figure legend.

To generate HKOs, hPSCs were subjected to stepwise differentiation using the specified media (Fig.1A–B). By day 26, the HKOs were fully formed, and their molecular characteristics were analyzed using qPCR and IF analysis. qPCR analysis showed increased expression of key markers, including CK19 (epithelial cytoskeleton and ductal marker) (Leelawat et al.2012), ECAD (cyst epithelium marker) (Carreón-Burciaga et al.2018), NPHS1 (nephrin marker) (Kuusniemi et al.2004), and PODXL and WT1 (podocyte markers) (Guo et al.2002), in HKOs compared to undifferentiated cells (Fig.1C). IF further confirmed the presence of CK19 and PODXL in the organoids (Fig.1D). The successful induction of HKOs was also verified using HE staining (Fig.1E).

To determine the optimal concentration of LPS for HKO treatment, the organoids were exposed to increasing LPS doses. Viability assays based on ATP levels indicated that LPS concentrations of 20, 50 and 100 μg/mL memorably reduced HKO viability (FigureS1A). A dose of 50 μg/mL was selected for further experiments as it produced a consistent, moderate effect. Subsequent analyses revealed that HKOs treated with 50 μg/mL LPS were smaller than untreated controls (FigureS1B) and exhibited elevated Fe2+levels (FigureS1C), suggesting the potential induction of ferroptosis, moreover, LPS treatment led to significant increases in the levels of CXCL10, IL-6, and TNF-α (FigureS1D). These findings demonstrate the successful establishment of HKOs and highlight their potential as a robust organoid model for studying SI-AKI.

To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying SI–AKI, we performed RNA-seq to compare the transcriptomic profiles of LPS-treated HKOs with untreated controls. This analysis identified 1,132 DEGs, including 819 upregulated and 313 downregulated genes in LPS-exposed HKOs (Fig.2A). GO enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs are associated with inflammation-related processes, such as CCR chemokine receptor binding, cytokine/chemokine activity, and leukocyte/neutrophil migration. Additionally, another major subset of DEGs was linked to muscle function, including processes like muscle alpha-actinin binding, muscle contraction, and myosin II complex regulation (Fig.2B). Consistently, KEGG analysis highlighted the involvement of these DEGs in immune-related pathways, including the TNF pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, and IL-17 pathway (Fig.2C).

To identify USPs activated in LPS-treated HKOs, we analyzed the expression of 75 USPs within the upregulated DEGs. Among these, three USPs—USP1, USP18, and USP34—were found to have increased expression (Fig.2D). However, qPCR analysis confirmed that only USP18 expression was memorably elevated in response to LPS treatment (Fig.2E). These findings elucidate that USP18 may play a momentous role in LPS-treated HKOs, potentially by regulating the immune response or other related biological processes.

To investigate whether the upregulation of USP18 in LPS-treated HKOs is associated with ferroptosis, lists of ferroptosis markers and drivers were downloaded from FerrDb V2. The expression profiles of these genes were then analyzed to assess their potential role in the ferroptotic response to LPS stimulation. Notably, the majority of differentially expressed ferroptosis markers and drivers exhibited significant upregulation in response to LPS stimulation, highlighting their potential role in ferroptosis activation during sepsis (Fig.3A-D).

To validate our findings the expression matrix ofGSE154918was acquired from the GEO database. Only sepsis and healthy control samples were included in this study. PCA was performed to evaluate the homogeneity and consistency of the samples. Outlier samples, identified through PCA (GSM4683603,GSM4683576, andGSM4683568), were excluded from subsequent analyses. After outlier removal, both PCA and Pearson correlation analysis confirmed high consistency and quality across the remaining samples (FigureS2A-S2C). Among the genes significantly upregulated in sepsis, USP18 emerged as a notable marker, further emphasizing its involvement in the LPS-induced response (Fig.4A–4B). We also examined the expression profiles of ferroptosis driver genes inGSE154918, where the majority showed significant upregulation in sepsis samples compared to healthy controls (Fig.4C). By intersecting ferroptosis-related genes significantly upregulated in sepsis fromGSE154918with our own dataset, we identified ten genes (E2F2, S100A8, RRM2, IL1B, IGFBP7, CXCL10, SLC39A8, ACSL1, MPO, ACSL4) that were consistently and robustly upregulated across both datasets (Fig.4D). This intersection suggests the existence of shared regulatory mechanisms and provides further insights into the molecular basis of ferroptosis in sepsis.

To probe the function of USP18 in regulating ferroptosis in LPS-induced HKOs, we conducted experiments to deplete USP18 in HKOs. Preliminary screening revealed that all three shUSP18 constructs demonstrated effective knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells, with shUSP18-1 showing the highest efficiency based on qPCR results (Fig.5A). Using a lentivirus containing shUSP18-1, we successfully infected HKOs and exposed them to LPS. qPCR analysis confirmed a significant reduction in USP18 expression in LPS-treated HKOs following lentiviral knockdown (Fig.5B).

Next, we assessed the viability of control and USP18-deficient HKOs under LPS treatment. ATP assays showed a marked improvement in the viability of USP18-deficient HKOs compared to controls (Fig.5C). Furthermore, USP18 knockdown enhanced the growth of LPS-induced HKOs, as indicated by an increase in their diameter (Fig.5D). We then evaluated several ferroptosis-related parameters, including levels of MDA, GSH, GSSG, ROS, and Fe2+. In control HKOs, LPS treatment significantly elevated MDA, GSSG, ROS, and Fe2+levels while reducing GSH levels. However, these effects were notably attenuated in USP18-deficient HKOs (Fig.5E–K). Additionally, Western blot analysis demonstrated that USP18 deficiency mitigated LPS-induced changes in ferroptosis marker expression, including ACSL4, COX2, FTH1, and GXP4 (Fig.5L). Together, these findings expound that USP18 plays a pivotal role in facilitating LPS-induced ferroptosis in HKOs.

Because HKOs lack immune cells and vascularization, and LPS-induced injury in vivo involves neutrophil infiltration and endothelial activation, we then co-cultured HKOs with macrophages to evaluate immune-organoid crosstalk. The results showed that co-culturing of LPS-treated HKOs with THP-1/PMA significantly increased the levels of pro-inflammatory (M1 type) markers like CD86, iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α in macrophages, and the levels of anti-inflammatory (M2 type) markers like CD206 and Arg-1 reduced. While USP18 depletion-LPS-treated HKOs co-cultured with THP-1/PMA result in significant reduced levels of CD86, iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α in macrophages, and the levels of CD206 and Arg-1 increased. Therefore, deficiency of USP18 may regulate the interaction between HKOs and macrophages, thereby inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and restraining the inflammatory response in LPS-treated HKOs (FigureS3A-F).

To elucidate the mechanism underlying USP18’s pro-ferroptotic role in LPS-induced HKOs, we used the BioGRID database to identify potential USP18-interacting substrates (Stark et al.2006). Among the candidates, we focused on ferroptosis regulators ZEB1, BECN1, and STING1 (Schwab et al.2024; Kang et al.2018; Li et al.2021). Using co-IP in HEK293T cells overexpressing these proteins, we found that USP18 specifically interacted with STING1 (Fig.6A). Given USP18’s DUB activity, we hypothesized that it modulates STING1 ubiquitination and stability. To investigate whether STING1 degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, we treated HEK293T cells with CHX to block protein synthesis and MG132 to inhibit proteasomal activity. Western blot revealed a dose-dependent increase in STING1 levels with MG132 treatment, confirming that STING1 degradation is at least partially, proteasome-dependent (Fig.6B).

We then validated the USP18-STING1 interaction in HKOs through co-IP (Fig.6C). To determine if the interaction was direct, we performed GST pull-down assays, which confirmed that USP18 directly binds to STING1 (Fig.6D). Further IP analysis demonstrated that USP18 overexpression signally reduced STING1 ubiquitination, while USP18 knockdown increased its ubiquitination (Fig.6E). Consistently, Western blot showed that USP18 overexpression stabilized STING1 in CHX-treated HKOs, whereas USP18 deficiency accelerated its degradation (Fig.6F). Collectively, these findings indicate that USP18 directly binds to STING1, deubiquitinates it, and prevents its proteasomal degradation, thereby stabilizing STING1 in HKOs.

To investigate whether USP18’s pro-ferroptotic role in LPS-induced HKOs is mediated by STING1, we overexpressed STING1 in USP18-deficient HKOs. qPCR analysis confirmed successful STING1 overexpression without affecting USP18 mRNA levels in LPS-treated HKOs (Fig.7A and B). By assessing ATP levels and organoid diameter, we observed that STING1 overexpression decreased the viability and growth of USP18-deficient HKOs exposed to LPS (Fig.7C and D). Additionally, excessive STING1 increased levels of MDA, GSSG, ROS, and Fe2+while reducing GSH levels in USP18-deficient HKOs under LPS treatment (Fig.7E–K). At the molecular level, Western blot analysis revealed that STING1 overexpression in USP18-deficient HKOs elevated the expression of COX2 and ACSL4 while reducing the levels of GPX4 and FTH1 (Fig.7L). These findings demonstrate that STING1 plays a critical role in mediating USP18’s pro-ferroptotic effects in LPS-treated HKOs.

To further confirm the relationship between USP18 and ferroptosis, we performed rescue experiment by overexpressing USP18 and treating the LPS-treated HKOs with Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, ferroptosis inhibitors). qPCR and Western blot confirmed LPS increased the expression levels of USP18 and STING in HKOs. Overexpression of USP18 signally aggrandized the levels of USP18 as well as protein levels of USP18 and STING1 in LPS-induced HKOs, but had no effect on the levels of STING1. Furthermore, the Fer-1 treatment had no prominent effect on the levels of USP18 and STING1 in LPS-induced HKOs but significantly downregulated the mRNA levels of USP18 in LPS-induced HKOs with USP18 overexpressed (Fig.8A and B). By assessing ATP levels and organoid diameter, we observed that USP18 overexpression decreased the viability and growth of LPS-treated HKOs, Fer-1 treatment increased the viability and growth of LPS-treated HKOs and USP18 overexpressed-LPS-treated HKOs, furthermore, overexpression of USP18 can weaken the promoting effects of Fer-1 on the viability and growth of LPS-treated HKOs (Fig.8C and D). Additionally, excessive USP18 increased levels of MDA, GSSG, ROS, and Fe2+while reducing GSH levels in LPS-treated HKOs, Fer-1 treatment reduced the levels of MDA, GSSG, ROS, and Fe2+while increasing GSH levels in LPS-treated HKOs and USP18 overexpressed-LPS-treated HKOs. Overexpression of USP18 can weaken the inhibitory effects of Fer-1 on ferroptosis in LPS-treated HKOs (Fig.8E–K). At the molecular level, Western blot analysis revealed that USP18 overexpression in LPS-treated HKOs elevated the expression of COX2 and ACSL4 while reducing the levels of GPX4 and FTH1, while Fer-1 treatment decreased the expression of COX2 and ACSL4 while increasing the levels of GPX4 and FTH1 in LPS-treated HKOs. But Fer-1 had no conspicuous effect on the levels of GPX4 and FTH1 in USP18 overexpressed-LPS-treated HKOs. Similarly, overexpression of USP18 can also weaken the effects of Fer-1 on these proteins in LPS-treated HKOs (Fig.8L–O). Together, these findings suggest that USP18 indeed regulates ferroptosis in LPS-treated HKOs.

Despite emerging research uncovering various mechanisms that contribute to SI-AKI (Zarbock et al.2023), the prognosis of SI-AKI patients remains unsatisfactory (Liu et al.2020b), partially due to the incomplete understanding of the pathology behind the complex condition and a lack of appropriate system modeling human SI-AKI. In this study, we utilized LPS-treated HKOs as an SI-AKI model and revealed a novel mechanism involving the USP18-STING1 axis and ferroptosis that may contribute to SI-AKI development (Fig.9).

USP18 is known for its function in regulating immunological processes and cancer development (Honke et al.2016). Its role in LPS-induced injury in various organs is being uncovered. For instance, USP18 represses the PI3K-AKT/NF-κB pathway to promote apoptosis and reduce the inflammatory response of LPS-induced SI-AKI (Chong et al.2024). USP18 also regulates the TLR4/NF-κB/ROS cascade to alleviate LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in HPMECs (Jiang et al.2021). However, whether USP18 fulfills its function in SI-AKI by controlling ferroptosis and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our finding provides direct evidence that USP18 can exacerbate ferroptosis by regulating the ubiquitination and stability of STING1, thereby affecting SI-AKI.

A few studies have highlighted the regulation of USP18 in ferroptosis in other biological processes. For instance, USP18 restrains ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis to relieve cerebral I/R injury by stabilizing FTO (Zhang et al.2024). USP18 also coordinates with ubiquitin-ligase CRL3KCTD10to regulate the stability of SLC7A11, thereby controlling cysteine uptake and ferroptosis in human breast cancer cells (Zhou et al.2024). Our data that USP18 promotes ferroptosis in LPS-treated HKOs by stabilizing STING1 underscores the pro-ferroptotic role of USP18, suggesting that its impact on ferroptosis is context-dependent, which may be attributed to its distinct substrates in these scenarios.

Our bioinformatic analysis of USP18-interacting proteins identified multiple genes. Among the four potential partners we assayed, only STING1 shows interaction with USP18. STING1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein involved in response to host DNA damage and pathogen invasion and regulates various types of PCD (Li et al.2021; Zhang et al.2021b). It is also a ferroptosis inducer in pancreatic cancer cells, functioning by controlling the MFN1/2-dependent mitochondrial fusion (Li et al.2021). A recent report shows that STING1 promotes NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy to facilitate ferroptosis induction during ischemic AKI (Jin et al.2023). In line with this, our study also reveals the pro-ferroptotic function of STING1 in SI-AKI, indicating a common impact of STING1 on the ferroptosis of renal tissues in response to acute injury. Studies have shown that STING exerts its effects in myocardial I/R-induced myocardial ferroptosis by triggering autophagy-lysosome-mediated degradation of GPX4 (Wang et al.2025). STING directly activates the autophagy process, thereby facilitating ferroptosis by eliminating ferritin (Liu et al.2020c). STING can also regulate ferroptosis via STAT3 pathway (Gu et al.2024). Furthermore, STING can mediate the ferroptosis process in lupus nephritis by activating the NF-κB pathway (Chen et al.2024b). In this study, the downstream mechanism by which STING1 regulates ferroptosis remains unclear, further exploration is needed.

Given the diverse range of substrates of USP18, it is unlikely that STING1 is the only mediator of USP18’s pro-ferroptotic role in LPS-induced HKOs. Although our co-IP assays failed to detect interactions between USP18 and ferroptosis drivers ZEB1 or BECN1, it is possible that their interaction need involvement of additional factors, whose expression is not sufficient to support the interaction when only USP18 and ZEB1 or BECN1 are overexpressed. Detecting the potential interaction between endogenous USP18 and these factors using more sensitive technology like proximity ligation assay may help to test this possibility.

The expression of STING1 is controlled at multiple levels. Its transcription is regulated by a LncRNA MALAT1 and transcription factor CREB in hyperoxia-induced lung epithelial cells (Chen et al.2020). NF-κB can also controll the transcription of STING1 by alternative promoter usage (Chen et al.2023). At the post-transcriptional level, STING1 mRNA is potentially targeted by miRNAs (Chen et al.2024a). Post-translationally, STING1 can be activated by ubiquitination catalyzed by E3-ligases MUL1 and TRIM10 (Ni et al.2017; Kong et al.2023) and its degradation involves lysosome or autophagy (Gentili et al.2023; Pan et al.2023). Our data that STING1 degradation is reduced upon protease inhibitor treatment demonstrate that the ubiquitin–proteasome also plays a critical role in STING1 degradation. While the E3-ligase promoting STING1 degradation remains unknown, USP18 obviously is a potent stabilizer of STING1 in LPS-induced HKOs. Further investigations are required to identify more ubiquitination regulators controlling the stability of STING1 in various contexts.

It is noteworthy that our study has several limitations. First, the conclusions are solely based on LPS-induced HKOs and lack support from other SI-AKI models, especially in vivo experiments. Second, both USP18 and STING regulate other types of PCD, and the influence of the USP18-STING1 axis on additional PCDs in LPS-induced HKOs needs further characterization. Finally, the functional and structural domains on USP18 and STING1 responsible for their interaction and the type of ubiquitination on STING1 removed by USP18 require further investigation.

In conclusion, we identify a novel mechanism mediated by the USP18-STING1 axis in regulating ferroptosis in LPS-induced HKOs. This finding further highlights the importance of ubiquitination regulators and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of SI-AKI and broadens the understanding of the mechanism controlling STING1 expression. Thus, targeting the USP18-STING1 axis may exhibit therapeutical potential in SI-AKI treatment.
