Pd catalysts demonstrate remarkable activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation methane-to-methanol (DOMM) under mild conditions. However, understanding the structure–performance relationship is challenging because Pd catalysts used in existing studies have complex polycrystalline structures. In this work, well-defined Pd nanocrystals with controlled morphologies are synthesized and used as model systems to investigate the origins of the observed structure-activity differences. Our findings indicate that DOMM activity is primarily governed by crystal facet type rather than nanocrystal size. The lowerd-band center of the Pd {111} facet weakens the adsorption strength of critical intermediates, including *O2and *OH species, promoting H2O2generation and CH3OH formation, respectively. Consequently, {111}-dominated octahedral Pd nanocrystals achieve an exceptional CH3OH yield of 201.8 mmol·gPd−1·h−1, three times higher than that of their {100}-dominated hexahedral counterparts. These results provide key insights into the structure-dependent behavior of Pd catalysts and pave the way for designing high-performance catalysts for DOMM.

Pd catalysts are promising for methane-to-methanol conversion, but structure–performance links remain unclear. This study uses facet-controlled Pd nanocrystals, revealing {111}-facets enhance methanol yield via optimal intermediate adsorption.

The direct oxidation methane-to-methanol (DOMM) under mild conditions is promising for producing basic chemicals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions1–3. However, DOMM still faces two enormous challenges: low reactivity and poor CH3OH product selectivity, which result from the high bond energy (434 kJ mol−1) of CH4and the facile overoxidation of CH3OH to CO24,5. In recent years, Pd catalysts have been widely used for DOMM because the electron-deficientdorbitals of Pd atoms can coordinate the C-H bonds throughdshybridization to activate CH46–10. Moreover, the H2O2generated in situ from O2and H2on the Pd surface provides abundant active oxygen species to accelerate the cleavage of C-H bonds7,11. Although numerous strategies, including alloying1,6, doping12,13or loading14–16, have been used to modify Pd catalysts, further DOMM performance enhancements are urgently required.

Unveiling the origin of highly active sites by establishing a definitive structure–performance relationship is key to developing high-performance catalysts. Generally, the catalytic performance of metal nanocrystals strongly depends on particle shape and size, especially facet or surface structures. Single-crystal faceted nanocrystals as model systems can reveal the facet–activity relationship resulting from differences in surface atomic strain17,18, orientation19,20, and ligancy21,22, etc., which cause significant variations in the adsorption, activation, and conversion behavior of reactants23–25. For example, during the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, compared with the Pd {100} facet, which shows tensile strain, the Pd {111} facet, which is under compressive strain, has lower ethylene adsorption energies as a result of the downshift in thed-bond center of Pd, preventing the over-hydrogenation of acetylene17. For O2activation on Pd {100} and {111} facets, the chemisorption of O2is more favorable on the Pd {100} facet, reducing the magnetic moment to nearly zero and resulting in the generation of highly reactive singlet O2from inert triplet O226,27.

The size–activity relationship of metal nanocrystals is related to the proportion of surface atoms (e.g., face, edge, and corner) and the electronic structure of the entire particle28. For example, in the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the higher selectivity of larger Pd nanoparticles is a result of the larger proportion of high-coordination sites29, whereas for electrocatalytic CO2reduction, smaller Pd nanoparticles provide more edge and corner atoms with low-coordination sites28, which is beneficial for CO2adsorption, COOH* formation, and CO* removal, thus enhancing catalytic performance. Therefore, the underlying structure−property relationships of Pd nanocrystals for DOMM involved the facet- and size-dependent behavior is an intriguing issue; however, it has not yet been investigated.

In this study, two types of well-defined Pd nanocrystals, denoted {111}-dominated octahedral and {100}-dominated hexahedral nanocrystals, respectively, were synthesized using a one-step seed-mediated growth method. The {111}-faceted Pd nanocrystals exhibit significantly higher activity compared to the {100}-faceted counterparts, as well as previously reported Pd-based catalysts, achieving a remarkable methanol yield of 201.8 mmol·gPd−1·h−16,7. Experimental analysis, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrate that regardless of the size of the octahedral or hexahedral Pd nanocrystals, the activity is determined by the exposed facets, an effect dominated by thed-orbital electronic structure of the surface Pd atoms. Crucially, the Pd {111} facet with a lowerd-band center exhibits the weaker adsorption strength on key intermediates, such as *O2, *OH, and *CH3, enhancing the generation of H2O2and reducing the energy barrier for CH4activation and CH3OH formation, respectively, and resulting in DOMM activity three-times higher that of the Pd {100} facet.

Figure1aillustrates a schematic of the preparation of the Pd nanocrystals with controlled facets and sizes. First, Pd nano-cubes (denotedc-Pd) were prepared using a well-known wet-chemical protocol30,31. Subsequently, Pd nano-octahedra (denotedo-Pd) were obtained using the one-step seed-mediated growth method withc-Pd as seeds. The size of thec-Pd can be regulated by adding surface passivating ions (Br⁻ and Cl⁻), thereby indirectly controlling the size of theo-Pd nanoparticles. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) measurements revealed that thec-Pd ando-Pd nanocrystals having different sizes were the typical face-centered cubic phase (Fig.1b, c), consistent with metallic Pd (JCPDS No. 46-1063)32. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrate that the synthesized Pd nanocrystals have two morphologies, hexahedral and octahedral, and four distinct sizes, having average edge lengths of approximately 5, 15, 30, and 48 nm (Fig.1d–k). The high-resolution TEM images (HRTEM) clearly show the {100} and {111} facets on hexahedral and octahedral Pd nanocrystals (Fig.1d1–k1). The integrated pixel intensities of the Pd (100) and (111) lattices indicate average Pd lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.22 nm, respectively (Fig.1d2–k2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate metallic Pd0for bothc-Pd ando-Pd nanocrystals, and the small quantity of Pd2+species was attributed to spontaneous oxidation in air (Supplementary Fig.1)33.

The catalytic DOMM performance of thec-Pd enclosed by the {100} facet ando-Pd nanocrystals enclosed by the {111} facet under mild conditions was evaluated in a stainless-steel high-pressure reactor (Supplementary Fig.2). As illustrated in Fig.2a, allo-Pd nanocrystals exhibited higher CH3OH yields of 2.5–3.2 times than those of thec-Pd nanocrystals. With the increase in the average particle size, the CH3OH yield gradually decreased for both nanocrystals; however, theo-Pd nanocrystals (5 nm) demonstrated the maximum CH3OH yield of 201.8 mmol gPd−1h−1(cf. 64.6 mmol gPd−1h−1forc-Pd nanocrystals (5 nm)). In addition, the CH3OH selectivity of theo-Pd nanocrystals was also slightly higher than that of thec-Pd nanocrystals. However, only surface atoms act as active sites, determining the adsorption/desorption of reactants and the subsequent catalytic route; that is, internal (bulk) atoms are not involved in the reaction34. Therefore, to reveal the effect of facet-dependent catalytic performance accurately, the DOMM performance was evaluated assuming an equal quantity of surface Pd atoms on the four different sizes ofo-Pd andc-Pd nanocrystals (Supplementary Fig.3and Supplementary Tables1,2). Regardless of average size, from 5 to 48 nm, thec-Pd oro-Pd nanocrystals produced the same CH3OH yield with respect to normalized surface atoms, indicating a zero-order correlation between catalytic activity and different sizes (Fig.2b). However, taking the 5-nm Pd nanocrystals as an example, the CH3OH yield of the surface Pd atoms enclosed by {111} facet was about 543.1 mmol gSA−1h−1, approximately 2.14-times than that of the Pd atoms on the {100} facet (Fig.2band Supplementary Table3).

All reaction conditions: 10 mL of water, 20.5 mg of catalyst, 70 °C, feed gas at 3.0 MPa with 1.1% H2/2.2% O2/67.2% CH4/20.57% Ar/8.93% He. Each reaction was tested two times to obtain the error bars.

The turnover frequencies (TOFs) represent the intrinsic activity of each atom, and the surface Pd atoms on the {111} facet demonstrated higher TOFs than those of the {100} facet, for example, 76.6 h−1vs. 33.1 h−1for Pd nanocrystals (5 nm) (Supplementary Table4). Thus, theo-Pd nanocrystals enclosed by {111} facet promoted DOMM, yielding more CH3OH thanc-Pd nanocrystals enclosed by the {100} facet, mostly because of the higher intrinsic activity of the former for the DOMM (Supplementary Table4). In addition, durability tests ofo-Pd nanocrystals demonstrated that the CH3OH yield and selectivity decreased negligibly after 12 reuse cycles, indicating a robust structure (Fig.2cand Supplementary Fig.4). In addition, the relationship between reaction time and DOMM performance showed that in the initial stage (0.05 h), the liquid products were the CH3OOH and some CH3OH (Fig.2d). Subsequently, the amount of CH3OOH rapidly decreased, gradually disappearing with the increase in reaction time. Meanwhile, the CH3OH yield gradually increased from 74.3 mmol gPd−1h−1at 0.05 h to 201.8 mmol gPd−1h−1at 0.5 h, and the CH3OH yield was constant beyond 0.5 h (Supplementary Figs.5,6and Supplementary Table5). Additionally, compared with those of reported advanced catalysts, the DOMM performance of theo-Pd nanocrystals enclosed by the {111} facet, i.e., 201.8 mmol gPd−1h−1with 99.7% selectivity, is the highest (Fig.2eand Supplementary Table6).

To understand the origin of the facet-dependent catalytic behaviors for the DOMM, CH4temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to assess the chemisorption capacity of CH4molecules on the Pd {100} and {111} facets (Fig.3a)35. Overall, theo-Pd nanocrystals had a lower desorption temperature (approximately 377 °C) than thec-Pd nanocrystals, which had a desorption temperature of 401 °C, suggesting that the surface Pd atoms on the {111} facet chemisorbed CH4more weakly than those on the {100} facet. In addition, the active oxygen species were also key to accelerating the cleavage of the C-H bonds of CH4molecules11, and their effects were tested via comparative experiments (Supplementary Table7). Product analysis demonstrated that the in situ generation of H2O2derived from the H2/O2mixture promoted the DOMM process by approximately 75.3 and 31.1 times compared to reactions with (H2O2+ O2) or H2O2as active oxygen species. As illustrated in Fig.3b, theo-Pd nanocrystals had a higher H2O2yield (32.9 mmol gPd−1h−1) than thec-Pd nanocrystals (15.0 mmol gPd−1h−1), implying that the {111} facet Pd atoms enhanced the in situ generation of H2O2, which is related to DOMM performance. In addition, the desorption of chemisorbed H2and O2on the surface Pd atoms was related to the stable formation of the *OOH intermediate, which determined the formation of H2O2. In addition, the desorption temperatures of H2and O2chemisorbed on {111} surface Pd atoms were lower than those on the {100} facet (Supplementary Fig.7), demonstrating that the Pd {111} facet forms the *OOH intermediate more favorably as a result of the weak affinity of Pd atoms and O atoms, thus preventing O-O bond cleavage36. Moreover, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to explore the key radical species37. As shown in Fig.3c, DOMM overo-Pd nanocrystals yielded strong *OH and *CH3radical signals, suggesting that the in situ generation H2O2provided abundant *OH radicals, which could break the C-H bonds to form *CH3radicals38. To investigate the changes in the species adsorbed on the surface of theo-Pd nanocrystals during the DOMM process, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were conducted (Fig.3d). When the CH4/O2/H2mixed gas flowed over the surface of theo-Pd nanocrystals, distinct adsorption bands at 3010 and 1300 cm−1were observed, attributed to adsorbed *CH4species39. The band at 1653 cm−1corresponds to adsorbed *OH species, implying the decomposition of the in situ generated H2O2to active *OH species. The band at 1344 cm−1represents the deformation vibrations of adsorbed *CH3species, indicating C-H bond activation of CH4by active *OH species40–42. In addition, the bands at 1059 and 825 cm−1correspond to the stretching vibrations of HOCH3* and *OOH species. The band related to the stretching of the C-O bond was observed at 2822 cm−1because of the presence of *OCH3species, and the band corresponding to peroxy-species (*OO) species adsorbed on Pd atoms was observed at 933 cm−143. As the reaction time was extended to 0.5 h, the band intensity of the C-O stretching vibration derived from the *OCH3and HOCH3* species increased. Concurrently, there was a gradual decrease in the band intensities of *CH3, surface peroxide, and *OH species. Collectively, these observations reveal the reaction route of the DOMM process on theo-Pd surface44. In addition, almost-negligible bands at 2378 and 2310 cm−1were assigned to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of CO2caused by the peroxidation of CH4(Supplementary Fig.8)42.

Next, DFT calculations were conducted to clarify the underlying mechanism of the facet-dependent catalytic DOMM behavior on the Pd {100} and {111} facets. The whole DOMM process was tightly related to the reaction triggering and conversion steps, where the former is the decomposition of H2O2into *OH radicals, and the latter involves two elemental reactions, including OH-induced C-H bond activation and CH3OH formation11. The in situ generated H2O2from O2/H2was related to the formation of *OOH intermediates, which were affected by the adsorption energy of *O2(ΔGads_OO) (Supplementary Fig.9)45. Compared to the Pd {100} facet, the weaker ΔGads_OOon the Pd {111} facet enhanced H2O2production (Supplementary Figs.10aand Supplementary Table8), aligning with experimental observations (Fig.3b)11,46. Moreover, both Pd {100} and Pd {111} were capable of generating *OH rapidly via H2O2decomposition with tiny barrier energy (ETS_OH, both ETS_OH< 0.1 eV) (Fig.4a). Therefore, the initial reaction triggering step was mainly controlled by the adsorption energy of *O2, and a relative weaker *O2adsorption energy on the Pd {111} facet resulted in higher *OH radical concentrations (Supplementary Fig.10b).

Thermodynamic and kinetic data on the Pd {111} facet were taken from our previously published work11,48.

Additionally, during the subsequent reaction conversion step, the OH-induced C-H bond activation to yield *CH3radicals, resulted in the formation of Pd-C bonds and cleavage of Pd-O bonds, and CH3OH formation was related to the cleavage of Pd-C/O bonds (Supplementary Fig.11). The DFT calculations indicate that the Pd {100} and {111} facets have similar energies for the adsorption of *CH3species, −2.09 and −2.11 eV, respectively (Supplementary Figs.10c). However, the adsorption energy of *OH species on the Pd {111} facet (ΔGads_OH= −2·70 eV) was obviously weaker than that on the Pd {100} facet (ΔGads_OH= −3·01 eV) (Supplementary Fig.10d). These lead to a reduction in the energy consumption required to break the Pd-O bond during both the OH-induced C-H bond activation and CH3OH formation process on the Pd {111} facets. The reaction energy barrier of the OH-induced C-H bond activation (ETS1) on the Pd {100} and {111} facets were 1.21 and 0.90 eV, respectively, demonstrating that the C-H bond was more easily activated and cleaved on the Pd {111} facet (Fig.4b). Further, the reaction energy barrier for CH3OH formation (ETS2) on the Pd {100} facet (ETS2= 1.51 eV) was higher than that on the Pd {111} facet (ETS2= 1.42 eV), indicating that the Pd {111} facet promoted CH3OH formation to a greater extent. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the differential adsorption intensity of *OH species on both Pd facets, rather than *CH3species, determined the OH-induced C-H bond activation and CH3OH formation, and the weaker *OH adsorption on the Pd {111} facet promoted the subsequent reaction conversion step.

To reveal the facet–adsorption behavior of both Pd facets and the reaction intermediates, thed-band center energies (εd) of both Pd facets were calculated47. The Pd {111} facet exhibited a lowerd-band center (spin-upεd= −6.85 eV and spin-downεd= −6.69) compared to the Pd{100} facet (spin-upεd= −6.66 eV and spin-downεd= −6.53) (Fig.4c). The downshift in theεdof the Pd {111} facet would result in the weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates, such as *O2, *OH, and *CH3species, consistent with the calculation results (Supplementary Fig.9). Notably, the adsorption energy of *CH3species on the Pd {111} facet was only marginally reduced by 0.02 eV compared to that of the Pd {100} facet. In contrast, the *OH adsorption energy was significantly reduced by 0.31 eV, which can be attributed to the stronger Pd-O bonds than Pd-C bonds, as confirmed by integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) analysis (Fig.4d). The significant Pd-O orbital overlap in the stronger Pd-O bond is reflected in the more negative ICOHP value. Thus, the Pd-O bond strength was more sensitive to the shift in thed-band center. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the Pd {111} facet superior to that of the Pd {100} facet originates from the weakening of the adsorption of the key intermediate *OO and *OH species induced by thed-band centers of the different facets, which not only leads to the formation of a high concentration of *OH radical on the Pd {111} facet for participation in the DOMM, but also effectively reduces the reaction barrier in the DOMM, which ultimately yields the superior catalytic activity (Fig.4e).

In this study, we used well-defined, {100}-dominated hexahedral and {111}-dominated octahedral Pd nanocrystals as model systems to elucidate the structure-dependent catalytic behavior for the DOMM. Comprehensive experimental investigations and DFT calculations reveal that DOMM activity is primarily governed by thed-band electronic structure of the exposed crystal facet rather than the particle size. Specifically, the Pd {111} facet, which is characterized by a lowerd-band center, facilitates the weaker adsorption of key intermediates (*O2and *OH), enhances H2O2generation, and lowers the energy barriers for both C–H bond activation and CH3OH formation. As a result, {111}-dominated octahedral Pd nanocrystals achieve an exceptional CH3OH yield of 201.8 mmol gPd⁻¹ h⁻¹, three times higher DOMM activity than that of the Pd {100} facet. These findings deepen our understanding of the structure−property relationships governing Pd-based catalysts for DOMM and provide a clear pathway for designing advanced catalysts with enhanced performance.
