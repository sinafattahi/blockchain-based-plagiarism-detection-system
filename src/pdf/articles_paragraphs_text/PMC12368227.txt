Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) remains a significant global health concern, with noroviruses among the most prevalent viral pathogens. However, other enteric viruses also contribute substantially to the public health burden. This study provides the first molecular characterization of a co-infection involving a rarely reported enterovirus A76 (EV-A76) and a norovirus GI.6[P11] in a patient from Thailand. Metagenomic sequencing successfully identified complete viral genomes, revealing unique genetic variations. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the EV-A76 strain shares high nucleotide similarity with a recently reported strain from Nepal, distinguishing it from previously identified recombinant strains. The amino acid sequence alignment of the complete EV-A76 genome revealed several distinctive amino acid substitutions compared to the most closely related strains. Notably, variations in the VP1 C-terminus and VP2 EF loop, known for high variability, were observed. These regions, crucial for epitope formation, are particularly susceptible to high-frequency mutations. This study reports the first documented co-infection of EV-A76 and norovirus GI.6[P11] in a single sample, identified through metagenomic sequencing in an AGE case in Thailand in 2023. The observed genetic variations highlight the necessity for ongoing monitoring of viral diversity to strengthen genomic surveillance and inform prevention strategies, especially for emerging pathogens with significant public health implications.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a significant public health concern, causing morbidity and mortality worldwide across all age groups, and is caused by a variety of bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens. Among these, viral pathogens such as rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus are important etiological agents of AGE1. While rotavirus prevalence has significantly decreased since the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, norovirus remains a leading cause of AGE globally2. Noroviruses are highly infectious and have a substantial impact on healthcare systems and economies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries3,4.

Noroviruses are non-enveloped particles belonging to theCaliciviridaefamily, with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, containing three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is processed into six non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 encodes the major structural capsid protein (VP1), while ORF3 encodes the minor structural capsid protein (VP2)5. To date, noroviruses have been classified into ten genogroups (GI-GX), with at least 50 genotypes. Genogroups GI, GII, GIV, GVIII, and GIX can infect humans6with GI and GII being the most commonly detected in human infections7,8. Dual-typing of norovirus is generally performed through sequencing of ORF1 and ORF2 junctions of the partial RdRp and the partial VP1 genes9. While GI noroviruses are less frequently detected than GII, they have been reported globally10–14. The GI.6 genotype has been associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks, highlighting the importance of its molecular characterization for epidemiological surveillance, particularly GI.6[P11] which has been detected as a predominant genotype in recent outbreaks in China15. However, genetic data for this genotype remains limited in Thailand.

Enteroviruses, which belong to thePicornaviridaefamily16are also common causes of viral gastroenteritis and are associated with a broad range of diseases in both children and adults. Enteroviruses have a non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved into four structural proteins (VP1–VP4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D) by two viral proteases (2Aproand 3Cpro)17. The VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins constitute the capsid surface of the virus, while VP4 is located on the inside. The arrangement of these capsid proteins plays a crucial role in viral antigenicity by forming conformational epitopes that are important for antigenicity and host immune recognition18. The viral capsid proteins are divided into three sites: site 1, site 2, and site 3. Site 1 is situated in the “north rim” area of the canyon near the fivefold axis. Site 2 is positioned in the “puff” region close to the twofold axis. Site 3 comprised two sections-one in the “knob” region on the south rim of the canyon and the other in the threefold axis region19,20. Conformational epitopes exhibit specificity in binding to antibodies that inhibit the interaction between cellular receptors and the virus. Furthermore, they are basic determinants of viral antigenicity and serve as critical markers for the classification of enterovirus serotypes21. Among Enterovirus species A, Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6), and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are commonly associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina, while EV-D68 (a species D enterovirus) is primarily associated with respiratory infections. Co-infections with multiple enterovirus species are frequently detected in patients presenting with gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory illnesses22.

Although many enterovirus strains are well studied, EV-A76 is a relatively rare type within the enterovirus A species, with a worldwide prevalence estimated to be less than 1% of reported enterovirus strains22. Due to its limited global epidemiological data, further genetic analysis of EV-A76 is crucial to better understand its genetic characteristics.

In this study, we report a co-infection in a patient with both EV-A76 and norovirus GI.6[P11] strains, and we further analyze the genetic variation of these two enteric viruses.

There were five GI.6-infected patient samples sequenced by metagenomics, which revealed co-infections with other enteric viruses in two of the samples (B9955 andB10503), as shown in Table1. In sample B9955, a rare EV-A76 strain was co-detected in a norovirus GI.6[P11] positive sample. This co-infection was identified in a 58-year-old woman from Bangkok, with a recent history of international travel; however, the country visited was not reported. On the third day after returning to Thailand, she consumed papaya salad and developed diarrhea. She was diagnosed with gastroenteritis of presumed infectious origin. Over three days, her symptoms included approximately five episodes of watery diarrhea per day, nausea, and abdominal cramping, without fever or vomiting.

Sample overview of five Norovirus RT-qPCR-positive samples.

The phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate the genetic relationships among norovirus GI.6 strains based on the complete RdRp and VP1 genes. Phylogenetic analysis of both two genes of norovirus GI.6 strains revealed that the GI.6[P6] strain from this study clustered with a previously reported strain from Japan (MW305501) for the complete RdRp gene, sharing 98.7% nucleotide identity. For the complete VP1 gene, this strain closely clustered with reference strains from Japan, Taiwan, and the USA, presenting nucleotide identities ranging from 97.4 to 98.7% (Fig.1). The GI.6[P11] strain (B9471), collected from Chaiyaphum province in 2023, was also most closely related to reference strains from Japan (LC646339) and China (MW243609) for both genes. It showed nucleotide identities of 99.2–99.5% for the RdRp gene and 99.1–99.2% for the VP1 gene. Notably, three GI.6[P11] strains collected in Bangkok formed a distinct cluster, separate from the reference strains.

Maximum likelihood trees of five GI.6 strains.(A)Complete RdRp and(B)complete VP1 genes were analyzed. The trees were constructed using the GTR best-fit model, with 1,000 bootstrap replications for branch support as implemented in MEGA X. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site, and selected bootstrap values greater than 80 are shown. The five norovirus GI.6 strains identified in Thailand are denoted in bold and with green (GI.6[P6]) and red (GI.6[P11]) circles.

Simplot nucleotide pairwise analysis of the complete genome sequence of norovirus GI.6[P6] and reference strains was performed using the prototype of GI.6[P6] strain (AF093797) as the query, revealing nucleotide sequence identity percentages consistent with the prototype strain and showing a similar trend in similarity percentages to closely related strains, ranging from 81 to 99% (Fig.2A) with the most diversity observed in p48 gene. Next, the GI.6[P11] strains were investigated to identify prominent amino acid residues (Fig.2B), that differentiate these strains from previous strains, including the most closely related strains from China that caused outbreaks between 2016 and 2019 (OR267445,OR267447,OR268208, andOR268635). We aligned complete genome sequences from different lineages, which revealed numerous unique residue changes, particularly in the ORF1 and 2 regions. The amino acid sequences of the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) binding sites were consistent across all strains. However, ten amino acid substitutions in the complete VP1 gene (10 A, 296I, 311 S, 338 T, 343 S, 356 V, 357 T, 378 N, 391 S, and 424 M) were identified, potentially affecting other viral characteristics.

The genome of strain GI/Hu/DE/1997/GI.6[P6]/BS5 (Hesse) (AF093797) serves as the query sequence. The positions of the complete genome region are indicated.(B)Amino acid residues of the complete genome sequence of Thai norovirus GI.6[P11] strains were compared with other GI.6[P11] sequences. The Thai strain is shown in the bottom four row (red bold), with unique amino acid changes labeled in red.

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequences (Fig.3A) revealed that the EV-A76 strain from Thailand is genetically closest to a strain identified from a stool sample collected in Nepal in 2023 (PP621603). This strain shares 92.2% nucleotide identity with the complete genome sequence of the Nepal strain, while comparisons with other strains showed nucleotide identities ranging from 84.8 to 90.7%. Alignment of the amino acid sequences revealed several distinctive amino acid substitutions in the complete genome when compared with the most closely related strains (Fig.3B).

The rare EV-A76 strain identified in Thailand is denoted with bold black and a red circle.

To investigate the genetic relationships among EV-A76 strains, we performed Similarity Plot and BootScan analyses, using the SimPlot program (v 3.5.1). The analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequence identities of the Thai strain showed the highest similarity percentage (81%−99%) with the Nepal strain (PP621603) over the entire genome (Fig.4A). The nucleotide identity in the structural protein‑coding region (P1 region, including VP1–4) of the Thai EV‑A76 strain was notably lower (61–96%) when compared with prototype (AY697458) and reference EV‑A76 strains (ON646245,MH118030, andPP621603). This contrasts with the non‑structural regions (P2 and P3 regions), which displayed higher conservation (79–97%). The BootScan analysis was conducted to investigate potential recombination events in the EV-A76 genome (Fig.4B). Our results showed an overall consistent clustering of the Thai EV-A76 strain with the selected reference EV-A76 strains, indicating no strong evidence of recombination across most of the genome between EV-A76 and EV-A89. However, a minor recombination signal was observed at the 5′ end of the P1 region.

The X-axis indicates the nucleotide positions across the genome, and the Y-axis represents the percentage similarity.(B)BootScan analysis using the Thai EV-A76 strain (EV-A76/THA/B9955/2023) as the query and comparing it with two other EV-A76 refence strains and one EV-A89 reference strain (shown in different colors). Both analyses were performed using SimPlot version 3.5.1, applying the Kimura 2-parameter model with a 200 bp window size and a 20 bp step size.

To further explore possible epidemiological links between the Thai EV-A76 strain and environmental isolates, we conducted a similarity plot analysis using reference strains derived from wastewater and sewage samples. The analysis revealed that the partial VP1 and partial 2C regions of the Thai EV-A76 strain showed the highest nucleotide identity with the sewage-derived strain from Nigeria (2018) compared with the wastewater strain from the USA (2020) or the sewage strain from Cameroon (2018) (Supplementary Fig.1). In the VP1 region, nucleotide identities ranged from 94 to 98%, which were higher than those observed for the Nepalese strain (91.5–95%), whereas the environmental strains from Cameroon and the USA showed only 67.5–84.5% identity. In contrast, in the nonstructural protein region (late 2A, 2B, and partial 2C regions), the Thai strain shared higher similarity (94–96%) with the wastewater strain from the USA.

The epitope alignment of EV-A76 strains was compared with previously analyzed EV-A71, CV-A16, and CV-A10 strains, as shown in Table2. Interestingly, two unique amino acid changes were observed only in the Thai EV-A76 strain in this study: 140D in the VP2 EF loop at site 2b and 60 A in the VP3 N-terminus at site 3a.

Enteric viruses are a leading cause of AGE, with norovirus recognized as a major etiological agent in both sporadic cases and outbreaks among children and adults worldwide include Thailand1,23. Other enteric viruses including rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, and enterovirus, are also implicated in AGE24,25. In this study, we provide significant insights into the molecular characteristics of norovirus GI.6[P11] strains and report the detection of the rare EV-A76 in Thailand.

Through comprehensive genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we characterized five stool samples: one norovirus GI.6[P6] and four GI.6[P11] strains, detected in AGE cases in Thailand from 2022 to 2024. The GI.6[P6] strain showed close genetic relationships with reference strains from Japan, Taiwan, and the USA. One GI.6[P11] strain from Chaiyaphum province clustered with strains from China and Japan, while three GI.6[P11] strains from Bangkok clustered separately from reference strains. Notably, no amino acid changes were observed at the HBGA binding sites I, II, and III (positions 331, 333, 347, 384, 386, and 389 in the GI.6 VP1 sequence, accession numberMZ227264)26. However, distinct amino acid substitutions in the VP1 gene of GI.6[P11] strains were identified, which may contribute to their persistence or pathogenicity.

EV-A76 was first identified in a strain obtained from a French military recruit with AGE during a 1991 outbreak of astrovirus-associated gastroenteritis among military recruits in Caen, France27. Subsequent studies have linked EV-A76 with neurological conditions such as acute encephalitis in India (2006)28and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in China (2011)29. However, the Thai patient in this study did not present neurological symptoms. Interestingly, EV-A76 has also been detected in patients with oyster-associated gastroenteritis30and sporadically in wastewater samples in France (2014–2015)31and Argentina (2017–2018)32. In this study, SimPlot analysis covering the partial VP1 through partial 2C regions of our EV-A76 strain revealed the highest nucleotide identity with a sewage-derived strain from Nigeria (2018)33whereas the nonstructural region showed greater similarity to a wastewater-derived strain from the USA34. These contrasting patterns suggest that different genomic regions of the detected strain may have divergent evolutionary origins.

Our findings suggest a broader clinical spectrum as evidenced by its detection in a patient with AGE symptoms. The nucleotide identity in the structural protein of Thai EV-A76 strain was lower when compared with reference EV-76 strains. This pattern is consistent with the high genetic variability typical of capsid-coding regions in enteroviruses18. Alignment of amino acid sequences between the Thai and other EV-A76 strains revealed unique mutations in several genomic regions that may have functional implications, such as altered viral replication, host adaptation, or immune evasion18. Notably, BootScan analysis revealed a minor recombination signal at the 5’ end of the structural protein-coding region of the Thai EV-A76 strain in this study. This observation is consistent with previous large-scale genomic analyses indicating that the junction between the 5’ UTR and P1 region represents a recombination hotspot in enteroviruses35–37. Moreover, the structured nature of the 5’ UTR-in particular the cloverleaf and IRES domains connected by intrinsically disordered RNA segments-likely predisposes this region to template switching events during replication, facilitating recombination38.

The Thai EV-A76 strain exhibited the closest genetic similarity to strains from Nepal. Notably, it presented unique amino acid mutations and showed no evidence of recombination with EV-A89, unlike certain EV-A76 strains from China that contain recombinant fragments in the 2C and P3 regions29. The predominant enterovirus serotypes worldwide, including EV-A76, CV-A16, and EV-A71, were the most common epidemic strains in Africa from 2007 to 2017. In Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, enterovirus epidemics exhibit high serotype diversity, with EV-A76 being the most prevalent39. However, in other countries, EV-A76 remains a relatively rare and uncommonly reported enterovirus type22. In Thailand, Enterovirus species A, including CV-A6, CV-A4, EV-A71, and CV-A16, are major pathogens associated with HFMD40. The identification of EV-A76 is particularly significant due to its rarity and limited genomic data available in public databases as well as the association with severe disease.

The conformational epitope alignment analysis of EV-A76 compared with EV-A71, CV-A16, and EV-A10, which are the predominantly causative agents for several outbreaks of HFMD41. The genetic diversity of previously predicted conformational epitopes analysis identified the BC and HI loops, the C-terminus of VP1, the EF and HI loops of VP2, and the C-terminus of VP3 as regions with high variability20. Our study revealed multiple amino acid changes in the capsid gene. Notably, VP1 C-terminus and VP2 EF loops variations which are highly diverse regions, were also observed. These findings associated with the epitope formation are particularly susceptible to high-frequency mutations20. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that the VP1 BC and EF loops play a crucial role in the immunogenicity of EV-A71 and in providing natural cross-protection against CV-A1642. Specifically, the VP1 BC and HI loops are involved in neural cell tropism43. For other enteroviruses, such as EV-D68, it has been reported that the dominant amino acid composition of the BC-loop and DE-loop continued to change ongoing viral evolution and may lead to enteroviruses outbreaks19,44. Moreover, VP2 and VP3 genes of EV-A71 and CV-A16 which constitute antigenic sites 2 and 3, play a crucial role in antigenic evolution20while the exchange of VP3 GH loop may contribute to partial neutralization escape42. However, research on the conformational epitopes of the EV-A76 capsid gene remains limited. The observed variability underscores the importance of continued surveillance of antigenic drift to ensure effective immunization strategies, which will be crucial for anticipating emerging variants and maintaining long-term control of viral transmission.

These findings highlight the utility of advanced molecular techniques, such as metagenomic sequencing, for identifying uncommon viral pathogens and co-infections in clinical samples. Although our results provide valuable insights into the genetic diversity, evolution, and potential public health implications of these viruses, the small sample size limits our ability to accurately determine the prevalence of EV-A76 and its co-infection with norovirus. Larger-scale surveillance and more comprehensive clinical data collection are needed to fully elucidate the epidemiological and clinical significance of EV-A76.

In conclusion, this study reports the detection of an EV-A76 strain in a patient presenting in Thailand, which may represent an imported case. Further studies are warranted to determine the source and transmission dynamics of this virus, and to support the development of broad-spectrum HFMD detection methods and pan-enterovirus vaccines, while ongoing viral surveillance will provide valuable insights to inform public health strategies and guide future vaccine development and antiviral interventions.

The research protocol for this study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, under the institutional review board (approval number IRB 549/62). All patient information and identifiers were anonymized to safeguard patient confidentiality. The institutional review board of the Ethics Committee for Human Research granted a waiver for written informed consent because all clinical specimens were anonymized. All experiments conducted in this study adhered to the relevant guidelines and regulations.

In this study, fecal samples were collected from patients with AGE (e.g., nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea) between 2022 and 2024. Samples that tested positive for norovirus GI with a Ct of < 30 by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay45were included. Norovirus genotyping was confirmed using conventional RT-PCR46Sanger sequencing, and genotyping via the norovirus genotyping tool47. We included one GI.6[P6], and four GI.6[P11] sequences for further analysis, these sequences included one from Chaiyaphum province and four from Bangkok. Feces samples were stored at −80 °C until processing.

RNA extraction and Illumina sequencing were performed as previously described48. Firstly, viral RNA was isolated from 200 uL of the supernatants, which were diluted 1:10 (w/v) in PBS, using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Secondly, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexamers and the Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). Thirdly, second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Klenow Fragment DNA Polymerase I (3′→5′ exo–) (New England Biolabs) to convert the first-strand cDNA into double-stranded DNA.

Paired-end libraries were generated using the KAPA HyperPlus kit (Roche), followed by enrichment with an in-house set of probes, named GastroCap (designed and synthesized by Roche), targeting at least seven vertebrate viral families known to cause gastrointestinal disease (Adenoviridae,Astroviridae,Caliciviridae,Hepeviridae,Parvoviridae,Picornaviridae, andReoviridae)48. Hybridization-based capture of viral genomic fragments was performed according to Roche’s standard protocol using the KAPA HyperCapture Bead Kit (Roche). Following capture, 14 cycles of post-capture PCR amplification were carried out with the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) to enrich the target DNA prior to sequencing. Libraries were then sequenced using the 2 × 250 bp paired-end protocol on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer, following the manufacturer’s instructions.

The nucleotide sequences of norovirus GI.6 ([P6] and [P11]) and EV-A76 were analyzed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), and genotyped using the Enterovirus Genotyping Tool (https://www.rivm.nl/mpf/typingtool/enterovirus/) and the Norovirus Typing Tool v2.0 (https://www.rivm.nl/mpf/typingtool/norovirus/)47, both provided by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Netherlands. Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW as implemented in BioEdit (v 7.2)52. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates were constructed for the norovirus GI.6 ([P6] and [P11]) and EV-A76 strains using MEGA X53. Bootstrap values greater than 80 were considered significant.

Pairwise nucleotide sequence similarity analysis was performed on norovirus GI.6[P6] and the Thai EV-A76 strain, in comparison with reference strains available in the GenBank database, using SimPlot version 3.5.154. A similarity plot was generated with a window size of 200 and a step size of 20. The Kimura 2-parameter distance model was used and the ratio of transitions and transversions was determined empirically.

Comparison of conformational epitope positions among three strains, EV-A71 (EU703812), CV-A16 (JQ354992), and CV-A10 (KP009574), with the full-length VP1–VP3 sequences of a Thai EV-A76 strain and 11 EV-A76 reference strains. The reference strains include the EV-A76 prototype strain from France (AY697458, 1991), six strains from China (JF905564, 2004;ON646232,ON646239,ON646240,ON646243, andON646245, 2011), three strains from India (MH118028,MH118029, andMH118030, 2010–2011), and one strain from Nepal (PP621603, 2023). Only positions with amino acid changes were highlighted when compared within the EV-A76 group.
