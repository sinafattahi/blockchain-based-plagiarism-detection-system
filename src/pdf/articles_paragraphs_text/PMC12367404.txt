Management of hilar biliary obstruction (HBO) often requires transpapillary multistenting; however, the insertion of more than three stents into severe hilar biliary strictures remains technically challenging, even after predilation1. Recently, a novel 7-Fr ultratapered plastic stent (Crane stent, SB-KAWASUMI, Kanagawa, Japan) has shown high insertability in endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage procedures2345. Given their structural advantages, we used ultratapered stents for transpapillary multistenting in two challenging HBO cases (Video 1).

Quadruple and quintuple transpapillary stenting is successfully performed without predilation using the novel 7-Fr ultratapered plastic stents.

Patient 1was an 81-year-old woman with hepatocellular carcinoma who developed HBO due to immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced sclerosing cholangitis. During the initial endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), three 7-Fr plastic stents were placed in segments B2, B7, and B8 (Fig. 1); however, the patient subsequently developed segmental cholangitis in B3, necessitating reintervention. First, the previously placed stent in B2 was removed, and a 7-Fr plastic stent was placed in B3. The ultratapered stent was then selected as the fourth stent and was successfully inserted into B2 (Fig. 2). No dilation device was used at any stage of the procedure. Postoperatively, the patient’s cholangitis improved.

Patient 2was a 69-year-old man with unresectable gallbladder cancer who presented with HBO. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed isolation of tertiary bile duct branches. During the initial ERCP, 7-Fr plastic stents were placed in B3 and B8 (Fig. 3); however, his jaundice persisted, necessitating reintervention. After the previously placed stents had been removed, three 7-Fr plastic stents were placed in B2, B3, and B5. Subsequently, the ultratapered stents were selected as the fourth and fifth stents and were successfully inserted into B4 and B8 (Fig. 4). No dilation device was used at any stage of the procedure. The patient’s jaundice improved, enabling the subsequent initiation of chemotherapy.

In both cases, more than three stents were successfully placed without predilation. The seamless transition between the guidewire, inner sheath, and stent tip in the ultratapered plastic stent system contributes to its excellent insertability (Fig. 5). This structural design may offer significant advantages for complex multistenting in cases of HBO.
