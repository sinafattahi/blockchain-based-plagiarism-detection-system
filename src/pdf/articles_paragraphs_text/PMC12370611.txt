Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignant neoplasm on a global scale, with tumor heterogeneity driving therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which are involved in regulating post-transcriptional processes, are becoming more recognized for their involvement in the advancement of cancer. This research conducted a thorough examination of the prognostic and functional significance of RBP-related gene sets (RBPGs) in CRC by utilizing transcriptomic data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Differential expression analysis identified 406 RBPGs (268 upregulated, 138 downregulated) in CRC. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed key modules involving 394 nodes, highlighting their functional interconnectivity. A prognostic model was constructed using 8 RBPGs (GTPBP4, KPNA2, CTNNA1, RRS1, SLFN11, CDKN2A, CHD3, TRAP1). This model effectively stratifies patients into 2 risk categories, each associated with differing survival outcomes. The model demonstrated robust predictive accuracy and was validated through subgroup analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, principal component analysis (PCA), and consistency index (C-index) curves. Integrating risk score, stage, and age, a nomogram was established to further enhance clinical applicability. Enrichment analysis linked high-risk groups to extracellular matrix remodeling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and immune evasion, while low-risk groups exhibited metabolic and immune activation pathways. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) indicated that high-risk patients exhibited elevated stromal and immune scores, alongside reduced tumor purity, which is associated with more aggressive phenotypic characteristics. Although tumor mutation burden (TMB) did not differ between risk groups, high TMB correlated with poorer survival. High-risk patients showed elevated tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score and increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, and targeted therapies. In addition, we further experimentally verified the expression of the hub gene in the tissues of colorectal cancer patients. This study establishes RBP-based prognostic signatures, elucidates their mechanistic roles in CRC progression, and identifies potential therapeutic targets, providing a framework for personalized CRC management. Further validation in multicenter cohorts is warranted to translate findings into clinical practice.

CRC is a prevalent malignant neoplasm on a global scale, with increasing prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates [1]. While advances in screening technology have led to increased early diagnosis rates, treatment resistance due to tumor heterogeneity remains a significant challenge, affecting patient survival. Consequently, there is a need for a systematic analysis of the molecular regulatory network underlying CRC development, with a focus on the genetic and epigenetic alterations of key regulators and their clinical translational value.

RBPs represent a category of proteins that interact with and modulate the activity of RNA molecules. They are widely involved in post-transcriptional modification, stability, splicing, and translation of RNA [2]. RBPs are integral to numerous cellular biological processes [3]. Research has demonstrated that RBPs exhibit abnormal expression patterns across various cancer types and are instrumental in modulating the expression and functionality of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [4]. In addition, RBPs can influence CRC progression by participating in the construction of TME [5]. The essential characteristics of these functions suggest that RBPs are integral to the processes of tumorigenesis, progression, and prognosis.

In this study, we obtained colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) expression profile data through the TCGA database. Subsequently, we conducted a screening of RBPGs that exhibited differential expression in tumor tissues and demonstrated a significant correlation with prognosis, thereby developing a prognostic model for CRC. Additionally, we developed a nomogram to enhance the predictive accuracy utilizing clinical characteristics. Subsequently, we conducted enrichment analyses to investigate the prevalence of RBPGs within various biological pathways and gene functions. To further elucidate the possible functional mechanisms and therapeutic agents associated with RBPGs in CRC, TME, TMB, and drug sensitivity analyses were performed.

Genomic and clinical information for COAD and READ were obtained from the TCGA database. Following the organization of the transcriptome data using R software, sequencing data for 650 CRC samples and 51 normal tissue samples were collected. Inclusion criteria: Patients with pathologically confirmed primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. Exclusion criteria: (1) Follow-up period < 1 month (calculated from initial diagnosis or first treatment); (2) Incomplete clinical data. The RBPGs were constructed through the integration of the following authoritative databases: (1) Gene Ontology (GO:0003723 RNA binding); (2) RNA Binding Protein Database; and (3) RNAcompete Genome-wide Binding Profiles data [6].

The expression matrix of RBPGs was derived from the RNA expression profiles of CRC. Between normal and tumor samples, in order to identify differentially expressed RBPGs, we utilized the false discovery rate (FDR) method to adjust the resulting p-values from the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test. The selection criteria included |log2FC|>0.58 and adjusted p-value < 0.05.

Using the STRING database, the PPI network of differentially expressed RBPs was established, with a medium confidence threshold, defined as an interaction score exceeding 0.400. The visualization of this network was executed by Cytoscape software. Key modules were identified and filtered utilizing the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in, with criteria set for node numbers greater than 5 and scores exceeding 7.

Initially, in all 562 patient samples were acquired by omitting those with incomplete clinical information. The clinical information corresponding to each sample was merged with the gene expression in the PPI network nodes. Subsequently, adhering to a 7:3 distribution ratio, the samples were randomly allocated into a training set and a testing set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on the training dataset to identify prognostically significant RBPGs, as well as Lasso regression analysis. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, the principal RBPGs involved in the prognostic model were determined. The prognostic model was validated in the testing set.. In the formula, exp(i) represents the expression level of gene i, and coef(i) refers to the associated regression coefficient. The samples were subsequently categorized into low- and high-risk groups according to the median risk score. Through several methodologies, the prognostic efficacy of the model was assessed. Initially, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis curves were employed to compare the 2 groups’ prognoses. Additionally, ROC curves and C-index curves were utilized in further validation of the prognostic capability. Finally, PCA plots were generated to confirm the model’s effectiveness in distinguishing between patients classified in the 2 categories.

To enhance clinical applicability, a nomogram estimating patient survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years was constructed. This nomogram was derived from a prognostic model alongside various clinical factors. Through calibration curves, ROC curves, and C-index curves, its predictive performance was assessed.

After identifying 339 differentially expressed genes in 2 groups, in this study, we conducted enrichment analyses to reveal the underlying biological processes, pathways, and functional characteristics. Initially, Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis revealed significantly enriched terms related to biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF), and cellular components (CC). Next, through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, particular emphasis on significant signaling pathways was found. Finally, to assess the differences in the expression of specific biological pathways and functional sets across risk groups, we employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), thus revealing underlying molecular mechanisms in deep. These analyses contribute to an in-depth understanding of the role that differentially expressed genes may play in tumor development.

Initially, the TME Score was computed utilizing the Estimate program to evaluate each sample’s TME characteristics, followed by a comparative analysis of the scoring between 2 risk groups. Subsequently, the CIBERSORT tool was employed to examine immune cell infiltration within the samples, allowing for an analysis of the proportions of various immune cell types present in each sample.

The mutation frequencies of all genes were assessed independently for patients in 2 risk groups. The TMB for all patients was computed, with values exceeding three times the interquartile range of the upper quartile or falling below that of the lower quartile identified as extreme outliers, in accordance with the Tukey’s Fences methodology, and subsequently excluded from further analysis. A comparative analysis of TMB between 2 risk groups was conducted to determine its potential impact on patient survival outcomes. The TIDE database was utilized to estimate tumors’ immune evasion capabilities and to investigate any differences in immune escape. Additionally, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) data for 198 antitumor agents were analyzed using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. The “oncoPredict” R package was employed to estimate CRC patients’ sensitivity to antitumor drugs.

This study incorporated ten pairs of colon cancer tissues alongside adjacent normal tissues, which were procured from a region exceeding 5 cm from the primary tumor site. These patients were diagnosed at Hangzhou Third People’s Hospital, China in 2025. No patients underwent radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgical intervention. All patients signed an informed consent form. The utilization of human tissue was sanctioned by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Third People’s Hospital.

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to assess the expression levels of mRNA within the tissues. Total RNA was isolated from the tissue samples utilizing TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the RNA was subsequently reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) employing the PrimeScript RT Kit (Takara). The primer sequences are as follows: GTPBP4 forward, 5′-GCGACTGATGAAGTATGGCG-3′; GTPBP4 reverse, 5′-GCGACTGATGAAGTATGGCG-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-TGATCACTGTGCACATCCGT-3′; and GAPDH reverse, 5′-CACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAA-3′.

The variations in protein expression of essential genes between paracancerous and tumor tissues were confirmed through the analysis of immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. Sections were prepared from paraffin-embedded specimens. IHC staining for GTPBP4 was conducted utilizing the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique. Rabbit anti-GTPBP4 polyclonal antibody (solarbio) was used as the primary antibody.

In the first step, 1,536 RBPGs were methodically identified and retrieved from reliable sources of literature and databases in total. Between tumor and normal samples, the heatmap revealed that the expression levels of RBPGs varied, while the volcano plot demonstrated 406 genes that were differentially expressed, of which 138 were found to be down-regulated, and 268 were up-regulated (Fig.1A, B). Network analysis indicated that the developed PPI network and top 3 modules consisted of 394/59/14/17 nodes and 5,768/1617/61/62 edges, respectively (Fig.1C–F).

In the training set, 18 RBPGs were identified via univariate Cox regression analysis as having a significant association with overall survival (Fig.2C). Variables withp< 0.05 in univariable Cox regression analysis were selected for LASSO regression. Via Lasso regression analysis, 13 key genes were then screened out (Fig.2A, B). Collinearity diagnostics using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) were performed, and the results indicated that all VIF values were below 5, confirming no severe multicollinearity (Fig.2E). Ultimately, via multivariate Cox regression analysis, we successfully utilized 8 RBPGs to establish a prognostic model (Fig.2D). For each patient: risk score = GTPBP4 × (0.584) + KPNA2×(−0.470) + CTNNA1×(−0.689) + RRS 1 × (0.673) + SLFN11 × (0.321) + CDKN2A×(0.143) + CHD3 × (0.285) + TRAP1×(−0.492). In the formula, positive coefficients indicate an increased survival risk, while negative coefficients correspond to a reduced survival risk.

By categorizing patients into 2 risk groups, we assessed the reliability of the prognostic model according to the median risk score derived from the training set. The risk score curves, survival status plots, and gene expression heatmaps (Fig.3A–F) suggested that with an increasing risk score, CRC mortality escalates. The high-risk group exhibited an increasing trend in the expression of GTPBP4, RRS1, SLFN11, CDKN2A, and CHD3, and a decreasing trend in the expression of KPNA2, CTNNA1, and TRAP1 relative to the low-risk group. Both overall survival (OS), according to the results of K-M survival curves, and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly greater in the low-risk group (Fig.4A–D). To further ascertain the prognostic model’s ability to predict OS based on varying clinical characteristics, patients were stratified into 2 groups (grade I-II and grade III-IV) for subgroup survival analysis, and similar results were seen. Additionally, Cox regression analyses confirmed that risk score functions as an independent prognostic factor (Fig.4E, F). The area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC curves for the entire dataset was measured at 0.757 for 1 year, 0.717 for 3 years, and 0.755 for 5 years (Fig.5A). The model demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity, compared to clinical characteristics, for predicting 5-year survival (Fig.5B). The C-index curves further substantiate the stability of the risk score model’s predictive efficacy over time, underscoring its high level of accuracy, a hallmark of a superior model (Fig.5C).

The data demonstrated adequate categorization in the PC3 direction, with low-risk and high-risk sample points forming two relatively separated subgroups in the PCA plot based on the RBPGs included in the model (Fig.5D).In the PCA plots based on all RBPGs and all genes, the sample points were distributed over a wide range, with blurred boundaries between groups and significant overlap (Fig.5E, F). In a word, the PCA plots of RBPGs included in the model exhibited clear intergroup separation, suggesting that these RBPGs may possess strong biological significance and predictive value.

Incorporating the utilization of stage, risk, and age as pivotal variables, a nomogram was constructed (Fig.6A). The calibration curves demonstrate a commendable concordance between the observed and anticipated outcomes, with the AUC of the entire set of 1-, 3-, and 5-year ROC curves measuring 0.793, 0.792, and 0.835, and the C-index value being stable and greater than 0.75 (Fig.6B–D). The aforementioned results presented suggest that the nomogram demonstrates enhanced stability and predictive accuracy, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making processes.

We performed enrichment analyses on the 339 differentially expressed genes identified in 2 categories. Initially, we performed functional annotation of these genes through GO analysis (Fig.7A). The BP category was predominantly associated with extracellular matrix organization and extracellular structure organization, among others. The CC category primarily included the collagen-containing extracellular matrix and endoplasmic reticulum lumen, among others. In terms of MF, the analysis revealed a significant presence of extracellular matrix structural constituents and glycosaminoglycan binding, among others. Furthermore, KEGG analysis highlighted key pathways such as the cytoskeleton in muscle cells and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, among others (Fig.7B). GSEA further demonstrated notable differences in the enrichment of biological pathways and gene functions between the 2 groups, with the top five enriched pathways and gene functions for each group presented (Fig.7C–F).

A significant disparity in TME scores was observed between the 2 risk cohorts. Specifically, all three TME scores for patients classified within the high-risk group were elevated, while the tumor purity in the high-risk group was found to be lower (Fig.8A, B). Furthermore, CIBERSORT analysis indicated an increase in the proportion of 4 immune cell subpopulations (Plasma cells, T cells CD4 memory resting, T cells CD4 memory activated, Dendritic cells activated) within the low-risk group, whereas 3 immune cell subpopulations (B cells naïve, T cells regulatory (Tregs), Macrophages M0) exhibited an increase in the high-risk group (Fig.8C).

The waterfall plots presented the fifteen genes exhibiting the highest mutation frequencies across the entire patient cohort, in which APC (74% vs. 74%), TP53 (66% vs. 48%), TTN (44% vs. 45%), and KRAS (41% vs. 45%) had significantly higher mutation frequencies (Fig.9A, B). Fiddle plots demonstrated that between the 2 risk groups, no significant difference was found in TMB (Fig.9C). Furthermore, survival analysis revealed that patients in the low TMB group tended to have a better prognosis. This trend was observed in the overall cohort after removing 79 outliers, where statistical significance was achieved (Fig.9F, G). In contrast, when outliers were retained, the difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig.9E). Finally, multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating both TMB and risk stratification confirmed their independent prognostic value (Fig.9H). Additionally, the violin plot showed that the high-risk group had significantly higher TIDE scores compared to the low-risk group, suggesting a potential association with immune evasion (Fig.9D). Cell line sensitivity half inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 198 antitumor drugs were analyzed in conjunction with cancer drug sensitivity genomics data. A total of 28 drugs had differences in sensitivity in the 2 groups (Supplementary Figure S1, S2). These drugs included five commonly used antitumor drugs (Fig.10).

We found that GTPBP4 might be a hub gene in colorectal cancer prognosis by taking the intersection of the genes with the top 10 ranking of the number of neighboring nodes in the PPI network with the genes in the prognostic model (Fig.11A, B). In addition, we performed qRT-PCR and IHC, and the results supported that GTPBP4 was more highly expressed in tumor samples than in non-tumor samples (Fig.11C–E).

Increasing research has emerged demonstrating the significance of RBP as both potential tumor markers and therapeutic targets, thereby underscoring its growing importance within the domain of cancer research.

A total of 8 RBPGs were incorporated into the prognostic model established in this study. Haitao Yu et al. identified an increased expression of GTPBP4 in metastatic colorectal cancer tissues in comparison to primary tumor tissues. Furthermore, they demonstrated that GTPBP4 has the potential to facilitate the metastasis of CRC by suppressing ras homolog family member A (RhoA) signaling activity, subsequently disrupting actin cytoskeleton organization [7]. Li Li et al. discovered that by directly binding to p53, GTPBP4 effectively suppresses p53-mediated signaling pathways, thereby facilitating gastric cancer cell proliferation while simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis [8]. Qiang Zhou et al. discovered that in hepatocellular carcinoma, GTPBP4 orchestrates metabolic adaptation through post-translational modification of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). The protein induces PKM2 sumoylation and promotes the formation of dimeric PKM2, thereby enhancing glycolytic flux to fuel tumor cell energy demands. Furthermore, GTPBP4 mediates PKM2 nuclear translocation, where it activates both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, driving tumor progression and metastatic dissemination [9]. Fengyan Han et al. discovered that KPNA2 interacts with S100 calcium binding protein A2 (S100A2) to create a cotransporter complex. This complex facilitates NFYA’s nuclear translocation while simultaneously suppressing E-calmodulin’s transcriptional activity, thereby enhancing the metastasis of CRC [10]. The E-cadherin/β-catenin adhesion complex functions as a critical invasion suppressor in epithelial tissues. Stefan J Vermeulen et al. identified that in colon cancer progression, genetic loss of CTNNA1 (encoding αE-catenin) induces αE-catenin protein deficiency, destabilizing this tumor-suppressive complex, enabling non-invasive cancer cells to acquire invasive phenotypes [11]. Xin-Lin Wu et al. revealed that silencing of RRS1 in colorectal cancer cells induces G₂/M cell-cycle arrest through modulation of key cyclins and CDKs, promotes apoptosis via up-regulation of p53 and CDKN1A, and inhibits angiogenesis, thereby suppressing CRC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [12]. Kaczorowski et al. found that more than 90% of CRC patients were SLFN11 negative, whereas metastatic CRC had an SLFN11 positivity rate almost twice that of primary CRC [13]. Tanwei Yuan et al. identified that CDKN2A promoter methylation and poorer prognostic outcomes are correlated in patients diagnosed with CRC [14]. Min Gyoung Pak et al. identified that in colorectal carcinoma samples, higher TRAP1 expression correlates with increased local invasion (pathologic T stage), suggesting a role in stromal penetration via EMT [15]. At present, there is a paucity of research examining the relationship between CHD3 and the prognostic outcomes of CRC.

Subsequent to the establishment of 2 risk classifications, survival analyses were performed on the comprehensive dataset, as well as on the testing set, training set, and various clinical subgroups. The findings from these analyses demonstrated a better prognosis for patients classified within the low-risk group than those in the other group. The analysis of ROC curves, C-index curves, and PCA plots indicates that the developed model demonstrates superior predictive capabilities and is proficient in distinguishing between the 2 groups. The integration of supplementary clinical characteristics into the nomogram resulted in a significant improvement in the model’s predictive accuracy.

The GSEA results indicate that in the high-risk group, the gene sets enriched predominantly pertain to functions associated with tumor aggressiveness and extracellular matrix remodeling. This finding implies that tumor cells in this group may exhibit heightened aggressiveness and possess the capacity to enhance tumor progression through modifications to the microenvironment. Conversely, the enrichment observed in the low-risk group is primarily about genes involved in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, suggesting that tumor cells in this cohort may display a metabolic profile that is more akin to normal physiological conditions. For biological pathways, the enrichment of gene sets within the high-risk cohort predominantly pertains to tumor-associated signaling pathways. This observation implies that individuals in this group may exhibit heightened tumor aggressiveness and an elevated risk of disease progression. Conversely, the gene sets in the low-risk cohort are primarily about metabolic and immune-related pathways, indicating that these patients may possess superior metabolic health and immune response capabilities, potentially leading to a more favorable disease prognosis.

TME constitutes a complex network of diverse tumor-associated cells and molecular components that are integral to the processes of tumor initiation, advancement, and metastasis [16]. The findings of our research demonstrated that the stromal score, immune score, and estimate score were elevated, while tumor purity was relatively diminished in the high-risk group. These suggest that the microenvironment in this group is more conducive to tumorigenesis and progression. This phenomenon has been documented in various other tumor types, including esophageal cancer [17], breast cancer [18], and hepatocellular carcinoma [19]. Maart et al. found that most bioinformatic analyses support that TIL-B and Plasma cells have a positive role in anti-tumor immunity and can improve tumor prognosis [20]. When the immune response concludes, most T cells undergo programmed cell death, whereas a specific subset persists as memory T cells, providing enduring protection to the organism [21]. Treg cells have been linked with unfavorable prognoses in colorectal cancer [22] and have the capacity to impede immune responses to tumors through multiple mechanisms, including (1) the interruption of metabolic pathways, (2) modulation of dendritic cell function, (3) production of anti-inflammatory molecules, (4) induction of apoptosis [23]. Dendritic cells constitute a heterogeneous group of antigen-presenting cells that are integral to the innate immune system. Their regulatory functions encompass the facilitation of adaptive immune responses against neoplastic diseases, and their activity frequently serves as a critical determinant of the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic interventions [24]. The differential expression of different components of the TME, as well as their interactions, collectively influence the prognosis of CRC patients. Overall, compared to the low-risk group, TME scores exhibit a higher ratio of immune-to-stromal cells in the high-risk group. However, the immune cells enriched in the high-risk group favor tumor progression, ultimately contributing to the poor prognosis observed in this cohort.

In this study, between risk groups, no statistically significant discrepancy in TMB was found. However, TMB exhibited a negative correlation with patients’ prognosis. Moreover, the analysis indicated a higher prevalence of mutations in the APC, TP53, TTN, and KRAS genes among patients diagnosed with CRC. This finding suggests that these genetic alterations may be integral to the pathogenesis of CRC. The impact of high TMB on cancer is contingent on the patient’s response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. For the majority of cancer patients, TMB demonstrated a negative correlation with overall survival in patients not treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and a positive correlation with overall survival after ICI [25]. The TIDE scores for the high-risk group were elevated than those of the other group, indicating that tumor cells within the high-risk cohort may possess enhanced capabilities for immune evasion and may exhibit a diminished sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors. Of particular note, the high-risk cohort demonstrated an increased sensitivity to various clinically validated antitumor agents, such as oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, erlotinib, trametinib, and dabrafenib. This observation offers a persuasive justification for the choice of these particular antitumor agents for application in clinical settings.

Although our TCGA-based colorectal cancer prognostic model exhibited strong internal validity using a 7:3 training–validation split, its generalizability is constrained by the cohort’s predominant Caucasian composition, the uniform treatment protocols of tertiary academic centers, and deferred cross-platform and real-world therapeutic validation. Unfortunately, due to current funding limitations, we are unable to conduct further experiments at this stage. To overcome these challenges, our future work will incorporate multi-ethnic cohorts, therapy-agnostic validation using real-world health data, cross-platform normalization pipelines, and prospective clinical cohorts with diverse treatment regimens.

In summary, the present study sought to identify novel prognostic indicators through the examination of differentially expressed RBPs, the execution of functional predictions, and the development of prognostic models. Additionally, the TME, TMB, and drug sensitivity of patients were explored. These findings have the potential to inform treatment decisions for patients with CRC. However, as an exploratory study, its clinical application remains to be validated through further multicenter, large-sample clinical studies.
