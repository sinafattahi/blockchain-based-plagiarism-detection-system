Endoscopic local resection is increasingly regarded as a feasible alternative to radical
surgery for specific early rectal cancer patients, preserving organ function and reducing the
incidence of complications12. However, the safe closure of large full-thickness defects after local full-thickness
resection remains challenging3. This report describes a novel solution – the application of super minimally invasive
stepwise full-thickness resection combined with an intermittent double-layer closure technique.
Stepwise full-thickness resection is a new technique that combines endoscopic submucosal
dissection (ESD) with direct full-thickness resection, using the exposed muscular layer after
ESD for the first layer of closure; then, the second layer of closure is performed from mucosa
to mucosa.

The patient was an 81-year-old female admitted for early rectal cancer. After a comprehensive assessment, she underwent super minimally invasive stepwise full-thickness resection and the defect was successfully closed using the intermittent double-layer closure technique (Fig. 1,Video 1). The mucosal layer around the lesion was circumferentially resected and trimmed to the submucosa (Fig. 1a). The intrinsic muscular layer was fully exposed using the tissue clip―rubber band-assisted traction technique (Fig. 1b). Under a clear field of vision, the location of the central cancer focus was determined, and the muscular layer was incised until the rectal mesenteric fat tissue was visible. The full-thickness resection was performed at this site, leaving a defect of approximately 2.5 cm × 2.2 cm, with the full-thickness defect being about 2.0 cm × 1.6 cm (Fig. 1c, d). After hemostasis with electrocautery and cauterization of the wound edge, several tissue clips were used to align and suture the muscular layer to the muscular layer (Fig. 1e). The wound surface narrowed after the muscular layer closure, and then, the mucosal layer to mucosal layer was aligned and sutured in the same way, ultimately achieving a tight closure of the wound (Fig. 1f). The lesion size was recorded from the serosal layer and the mucosal layer, respectively (Fig. 1g, h). The patient had no postoperative bleeding or delayed perforation and was discharged after one week of recovery.

Intermittent double-layer closure for full-thickness defect after super minimally invasive stepwise resection of early rectal cancer.

The super minimally invasive stepwise resection combined with intermittent double-layer closure technique can improve the safety of local resection for digestive tract tumors and is a feasible and effective method. By double-layer suturing of the intrinsic muscular layer and mucosal layer, it can minimize dead space to the greatest extent, potentially reduce the risk of infection, and promote healing.
