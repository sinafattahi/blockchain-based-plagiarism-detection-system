Listeria monocytogenesis a foodborne pathogen that poses significant challenges to food safety and public health due to its ability to adapt to harsh environments, particularly those found in food processing facilities. This review explores the global transcriptional responses ofL. monocytogenesto various chemical oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and plasma‐activated water. By comparing the transcriptomic data of multiple studies, we identified the differentially expressed genes associated with key cellular processes, including oxidative stress responses, cell envelope biosynthesis, metabolic adaptation, efflux mechanisms, and virulence regulation. This review demonstrates thatL. monocytogenesemploys distinct gene expression patterns to resist disinfectant stress, primarily by upregulating efflux pumps, reactive oxygen species detoxification mechanisms, and DNA repair pathways as well as modulating central metabolism. Several disinfection treatments commonly affect the key genes related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis, cell envelope, cell division, glycolysis, oxidative stress response, and chemotaxis. Although oxidizing agents induce widely conserved gene expression patterns, other treatments trigger unique responses. However, interpretation of different study findings is restricted by methodological inconsistencies, including variations in treatment conditions, media, bacterial states, and transcriptomic techniques. These variations and nonuniform fold change thresholds for differentially expressed genes complicate the comparison of different studies. Therefore, standardized frameworks are necessary to elucidate the adaptive responses ofL. monocytogenesand refine its disinfection methods in food processing.

Listeria monocytogenes, a resilient foodborne pathogen commonly found in soil, water, vegetation, livestock, and excrement, can contaminate food across the supply chain (Rodriguez et al.2021). Its ability to thrive under extreme acidic, alkaline, cold, and dry conditions makes its control challenging. This pathogen transitions from a saprophytic lifestyle at 20–25°C to a pathogenic state at 37°C by repressing flagellar gene expression (Pizarro‐Cerdá and Cossart2019). It also forms biofilms and adheres to diverse surfaces, which contributes to its persistence in food and clinical settings (Bechtel and Gibbons2021). Surveillance studies have reported its presence in dairy products, seafood, meat, and produce (Gérard et al.2020; Y. Liu et al.2020; Zakrzewski et al.2024).

Food industry uses chemical antimicrobials, such as chlorine, ozone (O3), and peracetic acid (Simpson and Mitch2022), typically in combination with alkaline or acidic cleaning processes (Simpson and Mitch2022) to prevent contamination. Additionally, physical methods, such as ultraviolet and high‐pressure processing methods, are used to decrease the microbial load (Sharma et al.2022). However, bacteria develop tolerance to these measures. Antibiotic resistance remains a major public health concern, as multidrug‐resistant “superbugs” are emerging faster than new antibiotics can be developed (Fatima et al.2023; Salam et al.2023). Acquired tolerance is particularly concerning, as it enables previously susceptible bacteria to resist treatment via horizontal gene transfer and chromosomal gene mutations. These changes often reduce the antibiotic uptake by altering or downregulating the porin proteins (Mancuso et al.2021).

Chemical oxidants differ from antibiotics in that they inflict widespread damage rather than targeting specific sites (Griffiths2005). Resistance to chemical oxidants is better understood as increased tolerance. Exposure conditions are crucial for examining tolerance.L. monocytogenescount is reduced by 1000‐fold (3 log reduction) by 0.5 mg/L hypochlorous acid in 10 s in the absence of chlorine interference (Gongora et al.2024). However, for vegetable wash water with 800 mg/L chemical oxygen demand (indicating oxidizable matter), a 2‐min contact with 50 mg/L hypochlorous acid is essential to achieve the sameL. monocytogenesreduction (Van Haute et al.2013). Comparatively, organic materials produce less potent chloramines that only cause sublethal stress, potentially inducing adaptive responses (Pfaller et al.2021).

Sublethal exposure to oxidants affects antimicrobial resistance. InPseudomonasspp., such exposure is associated with increased antibiotic resistance (Tong et al.2021). Chlorine dioxide (ClO2)‐treated wastewater shows a high prevalence of bacteria with tolerance genes (S.‐S. Liu et al.2018), possibly due to enhanced horizontal gene transfer via natural transformation (Jin et al.2020). Chlorination increases the membrane permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and activates the salt overly sensitive (SOS) responses, facilitating the mutation and spread of tolerance genes (W. Zhao et al.2025). Despite the widespread use of oxidants,L. monocytogenesfrequently survives in food processing environments. Its resilience is due to its ability to colonize microniches and exhibit temporary adaptive tolerance via biofilm formation, decreased metabolism, and increased efflux pump activity (Tong et al.2021; van Dijk and Verbrugh2022). However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive tolerance remain unclear. Recent transcriptomic studies have revealed theL. monocytogenesresponses to oxidative stress at the gene level (Fernández‐Gómez et al.2023; Kastbjerg et al.2010; Siderakou et al.2022).

ProperL. monocytogenescontamination control is crucial to prevent foodborne outbreaks and serious health consequences in the food industry. In healthcare,L. monocytogenesinfects individuals with weak immune systems, including expectant mothers, necessitating the development of effective preventive strategies. This review discusses previous reports on the global transcriptional responses ofL. monocytogenesto chemical oxidants to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its adaptation and survival. Additionally, this review highlights theL. monocytogenessurvival strategies under chemical oxidant stress to facilitate the development of suitable strategies to preventListeriapersistence in various industries, including food processing.

We conducted a thorough, albeit nonsystematic, literature search to identify the studies onL. monocytogenestranscriptomic responses to chemical oxidants. Our search spanned Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using combinations of keywords, such as “Listeria monocytogenes,” “transcriptome,” “RNA‐seq,” “disinfectants,” “chemical oxidants,” “oxidative stress,” “hydrogen peroxide,” “ozone,” and “chlorine.” We carefully reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full‐texts of the articles to identify relevant studies on bacterial responses to disinfectants. We extracted gene expression data as reported by the original authors without reprocessing the raw data from the main text, supplementary materials, figures, and tables and consulted raw datasets, when available, to support our findings. Although no formal systematic review protocol was followed, our approach was designed to be as thorough and focused as possible within the scope of this review.

We selected disinfection treatments based on the availability of published transcriptome data forL. monocytogenes. This review focuses on the global transcriptional responses ofL. monocytogenesto various disinfectants, particularly oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ClO2, ozone (O3), and plasma‐activated water (PAW). We also discuss additional treatments, including benzethonium chloride (BZT), lactic acid (LA), pulsed magnetic fields (PMF), and high‐pressure processing (HPP). While our primary focus is on oxidizing agents, we also provide a comparative analysis of nonoxidizing chemical disinfectants (e.g., BZT and LA) and physical treatments (e.g., PMF and HPP). This comparative perspective is crucial for distinguishing the transcriptional responses specific to oxidative stress from general stress responses triggered by various treatment types. Details regarding the strains, treatment conditions, and transcriptome analysis methods used in the reviewed studies are summarized in Table1. Further discussion of the transcriptomic effects of BZT, LA, PMF, and HPP is included in theSupporting Information Data. By establishing a comparative baseline, this review aims to clarify the unique adaptive mechanisms thatL. monocytogenesemploys to survive oxidative stress, thereby enhancing our understanding of how this pathogen responds to different disinfection strategies.

Disinfection treatments used to compare the transcriptomic responses ofListeria monocytogenesin this review.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were meticulously identified and extracted from the article text, tables, and supplementary figures of the respective published research articles on BZT (Fox et al.2011; Casey et al.2014), LA, H2O2(Cortes et al.2020), ClO2(Pleitner et al.2014), O3(Shu et al.2021), PAW (Fernández‐Gómez et al.2023), PMF (Qian et al.2020), and HPP (Bowman et al.2008). Each gene upregulated or downregulated by the selected disinfection treatments was logged into a Microsoft Excel file (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and organized accordingly. Transcriptome data of theL. monocytogenesAmerican Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 19115 strain under O3treatment were aligned and annotated against the reference genome ofL. monocytogenesserovar 1/2a (strain ATCC BAA‐679/EGD‐e) using the Geneious Prime 2024.0.5 software (Kearse et al.2012). Functional categories of each gene were determined using the UniProt Gene Ontology annotation tool with the prokaryotic slimming set (https://www.uniprot.org/), withL. monocytogenesstrain ATCC BAA‐679/EGD‐e as the reference organism (TablesS1–S9; Figure1). An online tool for Venn diagrams (https://www.interactivenn.net) (Heberle et al.2015) was used to merge the gene lists for individual disinfection treatments and identify the genes affected by multiple disinfection treatments (Figure2). Furthermore, a heat map was generated using Microsoft Excel to illustrate the effects of various disinfection methods on specific genes (FigureS1).

Differentially expressed gene (DEG) distribution among different role categories. Total number of upregulated (↑) and downregulated (↓) genes in each role category is indicated. Each cell represents the number ofListeria monocytogenesgenes differentially expressed in response to various disinfection treatments: benzethonium chloride (BZT), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP), lactic acid (LA), ozone (O3), plasma‐activated water (PAW), and pulsed magnetic field (PMF).

(B) Other disinfectants (benzethonium chloride [BZT], lactic acid [LA], pulsed magnetic field [PMF], and hydrostatic pressure processing [HPP]).

As mentioned above, the common bactericidal mechanism of most disinfection treatments involves the destruction of the cell membrane, resulting in the leakage of intracellular substances and DNA damage inL. monocytogenes. Additionally, disinfectants disrupt the intracellular ROS balance inL. monocytogenesby inhibiting the antioxidant enzyme activity, leading to bacterial inactivation (H. Li et al.2021). However, their effects on the genes and pathways inL. monocytogenesvary substantially, depending on the specific disinfectant used and pathogen responses. Repeated disinfectant exposure in the food industry induces selective pressure, enhancing the tolerance to these compounds, triggering the development of antibiotic resistance, and increasing the fitness ofL. monocytogenes(Bland et al.2022). Genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptive tolerance to disinfectants involve changes in the expression levels of various regulatory genes and pathways necessary for stress adaptation and tolerance (Schulz et al.2023). Therefore, a deeper understanding of the transcriptional responses ofL. monocytogenesto various disinfectants is essential for the development of effective disinfection approaches.

ClO2is a powerful and rapid oxidizing agent. It is used in both gaseous and aqueous food systems to effectively reduce the counts of foodborne pathogens, includingL. monocytogenes(Contreras‐Soto et al.2021; Pleitner et al.2014). This low‐molecular‐weight oxidative disinfectant targets almost every biomolecule, including nucleic acids, amino acids, peptides, proteins, and lipids (Fukuzaki2006), and multiple cell wall regions, causing cytoplasmic membrane disruption and peroxidation, enzyme inhibition (Maillard and Pascoe2024), bacterial genome destabilization, reduced energy production, protein synthesis disruption, and eventual cell death (Imlay2003; Kohanski et al.2010; Sazykin and Sazykina2023).

Pleitner et al. (2014) conducted whole‐genome microarray analysis to characterize the transcriptional changes inL. monocytogenes10403S when vegetative cells in the brain heart infusion broth were exposed to 300 mg/L ClO2for 15 min. Along with a 0.33 ± 0.37 log CFU/mL reduction inL. monocytogenescount, ClO2exposure resulted in the differential expression of 340 genes, of which 113 and 16 genes belonged tosigBandCtsRregulons, respectively, implicating both the general and protein‐specific stress response pathways. In total, levels of 223 genes related to carbohydrate and glycerol metabolism, protein quality control, hemostasis, phosphotransferase system (PTS), quorum sensing (QS), and several stress response genes (mainly oxidative stress response genes) were upregulated. In contrast, chemotaxis and flagellar gene levels were downregulated (Figure1). Oxidative stress responses ofL. monocytogenesto ClO2involve the increased expression levels of several redox‐associated genes, including superoxide dismutase A (sodA), organic hydroperoxide resistance (ohr)‐A,lmo2230, and global stress regulator (spxAandspxH) genes. These genes are crucial to maintain the redox balance and manage oxidative damage. Additionally, upregulation of the DNA repair (e.g.,frianddeoC), protein quality control (clpB,clpC,clpP, andclpX), and heat shock repressor (ctsR) gene levels indicates that the bacteria actively repair the damaged proteins to reduce the cellular stress. Taken together, these findings suggest thatL. monocytogenescombats ClO2‐induced oxidative stress by enhancing the systems involved in redox homeostasis, DNA repair, and protein maintenance (Pleitner et al.2014).

Oxidizing agents, reactants involved in redox reactions, gain electrons and oxidize other substances. H2O2is an oxidizing agent generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH) through various processes, such as the Fenton reaction that involves H2O2decomposition into oxygen and water, accompanied by considerable heat release (Andrés et al.2022; Manso et al.2020). H2O2is generally recognized as safe (21 CFR 184.1366) for use as a food disinfectant, provided that any residual H2O2is eliminated using suitable physical and chemical methods during food processing (Robinson and D'Amico2021). H2O2inactivates bacteria by generating radicals, causing oxidative damage to their cells, targeting the peptidoglycan wall and cell membrane, disrupting the nucleic acid structure, denaturing the proteins and lipids, and ultimately leading to cell death (Harter et al.2017; Manso et al.2020).

Along with evaluating the responses to LA, Cortes et al (2020) recorded the transcriptional responses of pathogens to oxidative stress by exposingL. monocytogenesstrains 6179 and R479a to 0.01% H2O2in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 20°C for 30 min. Only a few genes (154 and 73 DEGs in 6179 and R479a, respectively) showed differential expression under H2O2conditions compared to those showing differential expression under LA conditions. Levels of several genes related to the oxidative stress response and DNA repair were upregulated, whereas those of genes involved in cell wall and glycolytic processes were downregulated (Figure1). At the molecular level,L. monocytogenesrelies on conserved antioxidant defense mechanisms to mitigate H2O2‐induced oxidative damage. These includeohrA,ohrR, andlmo2230, which contribute to the detoxification of peroxides. GenesodAconverts superoxide radicals into H2O2,which is neutralized by catalases and peroxidases (Winterbourn2020). Levels of several DNA repair genes (dinB,uvrA,uvrB,recA,exoA,addA, andaddB) are upregulated in response to oxidative DNA damage. This repair activity is partially coordinated by the LexA‐regulated SOS response, in which DNA damage induces RecA‐mediated LexA autoproteolysis, thereby increasing SOS gene repression to promote DNA repair and cell survival (Cory et al.2024). A low H2O2concentration and interaction with TSB components may possibly suppress gene expression changes, as noted by Cortes et al. (2020). Nevertheless, upregulation of oxidative stress gene levels suggests a conserved bacterial strategy for redox detoxification and DNA damage repair.

O3, an allotrope of oxygen, appears colorless to pale blue and is soluble in water (Chuwa et al.2020). It is a potent oxidizing agent with a chlorine‐like odor, extensively used as a disinfectant in the food industry (Botondi et al.2021). Molecular O3and the free radicals (O•─, O2•─, O3•─,•OH,•HO2, HO3•, and H2O2) generated by its decomposition inactivate bacteria through complex processes targeting multiple cellular components (Epelle et al.2023). These include cell membrane lysis, resulting from the presence of unsaturated lipids and peptidoglycans in the cell envelope, and leakage of cellular components, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and enzymes, from the cytoplasm (Khadre et al.2001). Gaseous and aqueous forms of O3effectively inactivateL. monocytogenesin various foods, including lettuce (Ölmez and Akbas2009), spinach (Wani et al.2015), apple juice (Song et al.2015), apples, strawberries, and cantaloupes (Rodgers et al.2004).

Shu et al. (2021) evaluated the antimicrobial efficacy of O3at different doses (1, 2, and 3 µg O3/g of fruit) and exposure periods (1, 2, and 3 h) againstL. monocytogeneson the surface of tomato fruits. They found that a moderate O3dose (2 µg O3/g of fruit) effectively reduced theL. monocytogenescount (1.1 ± 0.3 log reduction) within a short exposure time of 1 h. Transcriptional profile ofL. monocytogenesat this O3dose revealed the differential expression of 283 genes, including 121 upregulated and 161 downregulated genes. Levels of genes related to general and oxidative stress responses, cell division, virulence, and chemotaxis were upregulated. In contrast, levels of several genes with unknown functions and those related to metabolism and transport systems were downregulated (Figure1). O3exposure triggered complex transcriptional responses, including the upregulation and downregulation of stress‐associated genes, inL. monocytogenes. Levels of the oxidative stress genesodAwere upregulated, whereas those oftrxB(thioredoxin reductase) andprli42(membrane‐associated stress protein) were downregulated. This indicates the selective modulation of pathways related to redox and membrane stress. Furthermore, the upregulation of cold shock protein (Csp)‐DandosmClevels indicated a response to cold shock and osmotic stress. IncreasedcheR, flgE, andmogRlevels indicated enhanced chemotaxis and flagellar regulation, supporting adaptive motility under oxidative stress conditions. These gene activation and repression patterns suggest thatL. monocytogenesprioritizes responses that enhance stress tolerance during transport and metabolic processes in response to moderate O3doses (Shu et al.2021).

Nonthermal plasma, particularly PAW, effectively disinfectsL. monocytogenes(Jyung et al.2023; Rothwell et al.2022). PAW is generated by treating water with a plasma discharge (ionized gas stream) that produces reactive species (Y.‐M. Zhao et al.2020). ROS generated in PAW contain potent oxidizing agents, including•OH, H2O2, atomic oxygen (O), superoxide anions (O2•─), and O3. ROS in PAW induce oxidative stress in microbes and inactivate them by damaging the redox state of the antioxidants (Z. Zhang et al.2013), penetrating the cell membrane by promoting lipid oxidation (Joshi et al.2011), damaging the cell structure by destroying the intramolecular bonds of the peptidoglycan layer (Yusupov et al.2013), interfering with metabolic activities, and eventually causing cell death (Wong et al.2023). Fernández‐Gómez et al. (2023) analyzed the transcriptomic responses ofL. monocytogenesULE1265 (serotype 1/2c), which were harvested from a stationary‐phase culture, resuspended in Ringer solution, treated with PAW (generated with 36 W discharge power and 30‐min activation time) for 5 min, and stored for 24 h. This PAW disinfection treatment for 5 min resulted in a 2.2 ± 0.1 log10CFU/mL reduction inL. monocytogenescount. Moreover, 399 genes were differentially expressed, with 178 being upregulated and 221 being downregulated. Expression levels of metabolism‐related genes, especially the cobalamin‐dependent gene cluster (CDGC) associated with ethanolamine (EA) and 1,2‐propanediol (PD) utilization, internal surface protein, chemotaxis, and QS genes, were increased. In contrast, levels of genes related to the cell envelope and PTS were decreased (Figure1). PAW treatment altered the expression levels of several genes related to virulence and general stress responses, many of which were regulated by the alternative sigma factor, SigB. Notably, the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system, crucial for acid stress responses, was upregulated. However, no significant changes in the genes typically associated with the oxidative stress responses were observed under the tested conditions. These results suggest thatL. monocytogenesresponds to PAW by remodeling carbon metabolism, PTS, and CDGC (Fernández‐Gómez et al.2023).

Comparison of the gene expression patterns ofL. monocytogenesunder different treatment conditions provides insights into the behavioral mechanisms of the pathogen under various stresses, improving our understanding of the gene regulatory networks and pathways involved in specific biological processes (Q. Wang et al.2022). Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the distinct effects of different disinfection treatments on the genes responsible for key biological processes inL. monocytogenes(Figure2). Most gene regulation mechanisms were specific to a particular treatment or shared by only two treatments. Few genes associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis (murA,murE,mreB, andglmS), cell division (filamentous temperature‐sensitive [fts]‐E,ftsX,ftsW, andactA), glycolysis (gpmAandgpmI), glycerol metabolism (glpDandglpK), nucleic acid metabolism (guaA), protein synthesis (rpsPandrpiB), PTS (bglP), cold shock response (cspD), oxidative stress response (sodA), chemotaxis (cheR), flagellar assembly (fliNandflgE), and virulence (inlA) were commonly affected by at least three different disinfection treatments, as shown in Figure2and FigureS1.

L. monocytogenesexhibits a cell wall composed of cross‐linked peptidoglycans with multiple layers of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids (Vollmer and Seligman2010). The cell wall plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the bacterium, with high internal osmotic pressure defining the cell shape, protecting against mechanical stress, and serving as an anchor for various proteins (Pucciarelli et al.2007). Most disinfectants disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, which is closely associated with the cell wall, thereby compromising the cell wall integrity (Brauge et al.2020). Transcriptome analysis ofL. monocytogenesexposed to various disinfection treatments revealed that these treatments affect multiple genes associated with peptidoglycan and wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis, cell envelope, and cell division.

The bacterial cell wall is a primary disinfection target. The peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway is essential to maintain the cell wall integrity and is tightly regulated inL. monocytogenes(Fox et al.2011). Alterations in this pathway affect the cell surface properties, cell wall integrity, stress tolerance, and overall fitness ofL. monocytogenes. Oxidizing agents H2O2(khpA), O3(glmSandmurO), and ClO2(glmU, murE, andmreB) inhibit the regulation of several peptidoglycan pathway genes (FigureS1). ThemurAlevels are upregulated inL. monocytogenesfollowing O3treatment. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis occurs in the cytoplasm by converting UDP‐N‐acetylglucosamine to UDP‐N‐acetylmuramic acid and lipids I and II through the actions of MurA, MurB, MurCDE, MurF, MraY, and MurG (Schulz et al.2022). GlmS, GlmM, GlmU, and GlmR catalyze a four‐step process to convert fructose‐6‐phosphate to UDP‐N‐acetylglucosamine, which is essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis (Schulz et al.2022).

WTAs are anionic glycopolymers covalently attached to the peptidoglycan layers of Gram‐positive bacteria (S. Brown et al.2013). These polymers play crucial roles in determining the cell shape, regulating cell division, and influencing other essential physiological features of Gram‐positive bacteria. Teichoic acid glycerol (taggenes) encodes the proteins involved in WTA biosynthesis. Levels of genes involved in teichoic acid biosynthesis, namelygtcA,dltA,dltB,dltC, anddltD, are downregulated after ClO2and H2O2treatments (TableS1).

Cell division is a crucial process in living organisms. Bacteria use binary fission to generate offspring identical to the parent cell (Casiraghi et al.2020). To ensure correct cell division, parent cells coordinate various processes, including overall biomass increase, membrane synthesis, chromosome duplication, and cell wall production (Silber et al.2020). These processes are mediated by a protein complex, known as the divisome, which regulates cell division (Mahone and Goley2020).ftsgenes inL. monocytogenesshow different responses to various disinfection treatments. ClO2downregulatesftsE, ftsX, ftsW, andftsLlevels, but notftsHlevels. O3and H2O2suppress the regulation ofsepF, LMOf2365_2563, andftsW. Moreover, levels ofyneA, which encodes the cell division suppressor protein YneA, are upregulated in response to H2O2. The products of theseftsgenes are essential for creating the septum and initiating cell division in bacteria (Han et al.2021).

L. monocytogenesmodifies its cell wall composition and thickness in response to stress, which affects its susceptibility to disinfectants (Cotter and Hill2003). Downregulation of peptidoglycan (murandglm) and WTA (dlt) biosynthesis gene levels inL. monocytogenesupon exposure to ClO2, H2O2, and O3indicates a stress response during which the bacterium conserves energy by limiting cell wall synthesis. This results in weakened cell walls and increased membrane permeability, making the pathogen more susceptible to oxidizing agents (Schulz et al.2022).

Central metabolic pathways actively produce stored biological energy and generate vital metabolic precursors necessary to build the fundamental cellular components of all living organisms (Romano and Conway1996). Gene transcription operates in conjunction with cell metabolism, with both mutually regulating each other (Bian et al.2022). Bacterial metabolic processes are the primary targets of disinfection treatments that causeL. monocytogenesto adjust its metabolism to survive under the disinfection stress (Bland et al.2022). Disinfection treatments affect various metabolic pathways, including respiration, energy, carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, and amino acid metabolism pathways.

Cellular respiration is crucial for generating energy and maintaining the electron balance in cells, particularly under stress. Aerobic organisms generate energy via cellular respiration, which involves oxidizing an electron donor, such as glucose, and reducing an electron acceptor, such as oxygen, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide. Electron exchange occurs via the electron transport chain to produce ATP, the primary energy currency for cells (Fuhrmann2021).L. monocytogenesexhibits flexible respirofermentative metabolism, allowing it to thrive in diverse environments using various carbon sources (Rivera‐Lugo et al.2022). Cellular respiration maintains the redox balance, regenerates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and produces a proton motive force. The Menaquinone (MK) biosynthetic pathway is essential for both aerobic and anaerobic respiration (Smith et al.2023). Various genes involved in the electron transport chain, NAD+regeneration, and ATP synthesis are differentially regulated under ClO2and O3treatments (TableS2; Supporting Information: DataS2.2.1), suggesting that energy metabolic pathways are responsive to oxidative stress.

NAD+is a crucial small molecule facilitating electron and proton transfer during enzymatic reactions (Chen et al.2024). It also plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism by reducing NAD+to NADH (reduced form of NAD) in multiple metabolic signaling pathways, including glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Xiao et al.2018). NAD+acts as a coenzyme in vital processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, protein deacetylation, DNA repair, and Ca2+activation. Expression of the NADPH dehydrogenase genenamAand the glutamine‐dependent NAD+synthetase genenadEwas suppressed by O3. Exposure to ClO2increases the expression ofatpCinL. monocytogenes. ATP synthases are multi‐subunit enzyme complexes found in bacterial cell membranes (Guo et al.2019). They use transmembrane electrochemical proton motive force to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Meyrat and von Ballmoos2019). Downregulation of NADPH dehydrogenase and NAD+synthetase gene levels by O3suggests a potential reduction in NADPH and ATP synthesis. This causes an imbalance in the NADH/NAD+ratio within the cells, affecting central carbon and energy metabolism (Zhang et al.2014). These expression patterns indicate the stress‐associated shifts in redox‐related pathways.

Carbohydrate metabolism encompasses all biochemical processes responsible for the formation, breakdown, and conversion of carbohydrates to provide a steady energy source for living cells (Chandel2021). Among the other carbohydrates, glucose, fructose, and galactose play vital roles in several metabolic pathways. The disinfection treatments differentially expressed several carbohydrate metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and genes associated with acetoin biosynthesis, pyruvate fermentation, rhamnose and lactose metabolism, as well as glycosidase activity (TableS2; Supporting Information: DataS2.2.2).

Glycolysis is a central metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate or lactate, producing ATP, NADH, or water through various enzymatic reactions to generate energy (Chaudhry and Varacallo2024). Among the disinfection treatments againstL. monocytogenes, ClO2and PAW treatments upregulated several glycolytic pathway gene levels, whereas O3treatment downregulated them (Supporting Information: DataS2.2.2). The major glycolytic genes upregulated by disinfection treatments includedgpmA(ClO2),ccpN(H2O2),cggR(PAW),eno(PAW), andpgk(PAW), whereas the downregulated genes includedgpmA(O3),gpmI(O3),pgi(ClO2), andpgmB(O3). In addition to generating ATP and NADH, glycolysis produces precursor metabolites for several metabolic pathways, including the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for cell wall integrity and tolerance to cell wall‐targeting antimicrobial agents (Fuhrmann2021; Reed et al.2015). Upregulation of glycolytic gene levels by disinfection treatments allowsL. monocytogenesto efficiently utilize the available carbohydrates, ensuring a constant supply of energy and metabolic intermediates necessary for cell wall regeneration, energy production, and other stress response mechanisms. However, glycolysis disruption by ClO2treatment possibly induces cell death (Ranjbar et al.2020).

PPP is a glucose oxidation pathway operating alongside glycolysis (Wamelink et al.2008). It produces ribose 5‐phosphate and NADPH, redirecting carbon to the glycolytic or gluconeogenic pathways. Ribose 5‐phosphate is used to create nucleotides, whereas NADPH maintains the redox balance and facilitates biosynthetic activities, including the production of tetrahydrofolate, deoxyribonucleotides, proline, and fatty acids (Kim et al.2023). Transcript levels of PPP enzymes, includingtal1,lmo2674, andlmo0342, are increased inL. monocytogenesin response to ClO2treatment. O3treatment also increases the expression levels of the PPP enzymefsaand decreases those oftktandtktCinL. monocytogenes. PPP plays crucial roles in maintaining the balance of cellular redox levels and supporting biosynthesis (TeSlaa et al.2023). These transcriptional changes suggest treatment‐specific effects on carbon allocation via PPP. PPP interruption influences the cell wall, alters the oxygen radical sensitivity, reduces nucleotide synthesis, and affects biofilm formation (Kim et al.2023).

L. monocytogeneshas a distinct and specialized metabolism because of its incomplete TCA cycle (Schauer et al.2010). It lacks the α‐ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme, essential for converting α‐ketoglutarate to succinyl‐coenzyme A (CoA). This absence restricts the pathogen's capacity to fully utilize the TCA cycle for energy production and biosynthesis (Whiteley et al.2017).L. monocytogenescompensates for this by using alternative pathways, including glycolysis, PPP, and pyruvate carboxylation pathways, to produce the intermediates necessary for metabolism and energy production (Schär et al.2010; Schauer et al.2010). This metabolic flexibility is crucial for the survival and virulence of bacteria within host cells (Fuchs et al.2012). H2O2treatment upregulates the expression levels ofcitB,citC, andcitZgenes inL. monocytogenes(TableS2). GenescitB,citC, andcitZ, which encode aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthetase, respectively, are associated with the regulation of the TCA cycle and central metabolism. Oxidative stress due to H2O2induces metabolic changes in bacteria, including increased pyruvate production and reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, resulting in altered metabolic flux and elevated pyruvate levels under stress (Bignucolo et al.2013).

Pyruvate is an essential metabolite that connects critical metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) (Luo et al.2023). The initial substrate for the gluconeogenic pathway is pyruvate, which can be utilized to produce glucose (Brissac et al.2015). H2O2and ClO2disinfection treatments exert different effects on the expression levels of genes involved in pyruvate metabolism. Levels of genes associated with PDH complexes,pdhA, pdhB, pdhC, andpdhD, and the pyruvate formate‐lyase genepflAare downregulated by H2O2treatment. In contrast, ClO2upregulatespdhC, pdhD, and pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) genepycAlevels. Pyruvate metabolism, primarily through the function of the PDH complex and PYC, plays a vital role in carbon metabolism inL. monocytogenes. The PDH complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl‐CoA, which connects glycolysis to the TCA cycle (Fuchs et al.2012).L. monocytogenesexhibits an incomplete TCA cycle, making PYC‐catalyzed carboxylation of pyruvate essential for oxaloacetate production (Schär et al.2010). These observations suggest potential shifts in the carbon flux under oxidative stress.

Disinfection treatments further altered the expression ofL. monocytogenesgenes involved in other carbohydrate metabolic processes, such as fructose metabolism (fbaupregulated by O3;fruAupregulated by PAW), lactose metabolism (ldhdownregulated by PAW), rhamnose metabolism (lmo1082downregulated by ClO2), and chitin degradation (lmo1883upregulated by ClO2;chbGdownregulated by O3). During disinfection,L. monocytogenescells enter a state of stress, requiring increased intake of carbohydrates as catabolic products for cell repair. Downregulation of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism suggests that disinfection methods directly restrict the ability of bacteria to absorb carbohydrates from their surroundings. This further affects the ability of bacteria to use their breakdown products for cellular maintenance, potentially limiting access to metabolic intermediates necessary for their survival (Qian et al.2020).

In addition to carbohydrate metabolism, the disinfection treatment affected several genes related to FAB and glycerol metabolism (TableS2). Lipids are the primary components of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. They form a phospholipid bilayer structure and can be categorized into several chemical classes varying in molecular size and isomeric form (Strahl and Errington2017). The precursor molecules of lipids are primarily obtained from central metabolism. Lipid metabolism is crucial for the ability of a bacterium to survive and multiply within host cells. Disinfection with H2O2, ClO2, O3, and PAW affected FAB and glycerol metabolism differently (TableS2; Supporting Information: DataS2.2.3).

The FAB pathway is a potential target for disinfection treatments, including antibiotics, because it plays a vital role in creating phospholipid membranes, lipoproteins, and lipopolysaccharides (Y.‐M. Zhang et al.2006). Phospholipids are key components of the membrane lipids that form lipid bilayers. They create a protective barrier for cells and facilitate cellular processes within subcellular compartments (Dai et al.2021). Phosphatidic acid is produced through two consecutive acylation reactions of glycerol‐3‐phosphate using acyl‐acyl carrier protein (ACP) produced by the bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis system (FASII). This substance is a precursor of all phospholipid species (Yao and Rock2017).Listeriaspp. initiate the first reaction of the FASII pathway by combining fatty acid thioesters with different acyl chain lengths with a malonyl‐ACP (Soares da Costa et al.2017). Exposure ofL. monocytogenesto PAW upregulates the levels of FASII pathway genesaccBandfabI. In contrast, ClO2downregulates the levels of FAB geneacpA, fabG,fabH, andlmo0970inL. monocytogenes. These transcriptional changes indicate alterations in membrane lipid synthesis in response to oxidizing agents. FASII initiation, elongation, and acyltransferase modules work together to synthesize fatty acids in appropriate quantities and structures (Parsons and Rock2013).

Glycerol plays a crucial role inL. monocytogenesvirulence and biofilm formation, serving as a significant carbon source that is metabolized through pathways involving glycerol kinase (GlpK) and glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) (Joseph et al.2008). Bacteria use glycerol dehydrogenase to convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone (Dha).L. monocytogenespossesses two Dha kinase systems, which are part of a PEP‐dependent phosphorylation system for Dha utilization and are connected to the PPP (Monniot et al.2012). Expression levels of genes involved in glycerol metabolism inL. monocytogenesare upregulated (ispandLMOf2365_1834) and downregulated (ispE,ispD,dhaK1,LMOf2365_1310,LMOf2365_0375,LMOf2365_2202,LMOf2365_2487, andLMOf2365_2806) after O3treatment. Other chemical oxidants, H2O2(dhaI,dhaK, anddhaM) and ClO2(glpD,glpK, andlmo0347), upregulated, whereas PAW (glpDandglpK) downregulated glycerol metabolism gene levels inL. monocytogenes. These changes in gene expression suggest that glycerol utilization is differentially regulated in response to varying levels of oxidative stress.

Disinfection also significantly affected the expression of genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. Nucleotides are crucial for various cellular processes such as DNA replication, energy storage, virulence, and signaling and are continuously synthesized de novo in all cells (Goncheva et al.2022). Treatment with H2O2increased the expression of thexptgene, whereas ClO2decreased xpt expression inL. monocytogenes. Thexptgene encodes xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, which is involved in purine salvage pathways (Glaser et al.2001). This enzyme converts xanthine, a nucleic acid breakdown product, into xanthosine 5'‐monophosphate, which allows the pathogen to reuse xanthine for RNA or DNA synthesis. Levels of theguaAgene, which encodes a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthase, are decreased after ClO2treatment (TableS2). This gene is responsible for converting inosinic acid to GMP (Bennett et al.2007). Similar to glycerol metabolism, levels of several genes related to nucleic acid metabolism inL. monocytogenesare upregulated (purA,mrnC,nrdD,nudL,xerC,gmk,carB, andtenA) or downregulated (purL,purE,recF,adaB,dinB,gyrB,holB,cysK,rnhC,dprA,LMOf2365_1336,LMOf2365_1861,LMOf2365_2183,LMOf2365_2186,LMOf2365_2656, andLMOf2365_1822) by O3treatment. These transcriptional shifts indicate treatment‐specific effects on nucleotide synthesis, salvage, and DNA repair under stress conditions.

Amino acids are essential for protein synthesis in microorganisms and play crucial roles in regulating peptidoglycan metabolism, maintaining cell structure, promoting bacterial growth, facilitating biofilm formation, and protecting against environmental hazards (Miyamoto and Homma2021). ClO2treatment upregulates the expression levels ofgcvT,gcvH, andgcvPB(TableS2). Excess glycine hinders the growth of several bacteria (Minami et al.2004). The glycine cleavage system is a multienzyme system, catalyzing the oxidative cleavage of glycine to form 5,10‐methylene‐tetrahydrofolate, a crucial one‐carbon precursor for various biosynthetic processes, along with serine, thymidine, and purines (M. J. Brown et al.2014). The GCS pathway also contributes to energy metabolism in bacterial cells by generating NADH (Kikuchi et al.2008). Upregulation of GCS gene levels by ClO2treatment increases the metabolic fitness ofL. monocytogenes(M. J. Brown et al.2014).

Some genes associated with the GAD pathway are differentially expressed inL. monocytogenesin response to disinfection. ClO2and PAW treatments upregulate the expression levels ofgadBandgadCinL. monocytogenes. The GAD pathway functions as a central mechanism for acid tolerance, facilitating microbial survival at low pH (Sezgin and Tekin2023). This pathway transports extracellular glutamate into the cell and converts it to γ‐aminobutyrate (GABA), thereby increasing the intracellular pH under acid stress to maintain the intracellular pH homeostasis (C. Wang et al.2018). GAD pathway gene expression changes inL. monocytogenesby ClO2and PAW treatments primarily affect its acid tolerance and intracellular pH homeostasis, further impacting metabolism, stress response, and survival (Feehily and Karatzas2013).

L. monocytogenesresists disinfectants via biofilm formation (Skowron et al.2018), detoxification using efflux pumps (Jiang et al.2016), oxidative stress responses (Ogunleye et al.2024), and adaptive metabolic flexibility (Wiktorczyk‐Kapischke et al.2021). Metabolic flexibility allowsL. monocytogenesto use various carbon sources (e.g., such as glycerol and amino acids), depending on the environmental conditions (Schauer et al.2010). Metabolic enzymes facilitate this adaptability, enabling the bacterium to switch between metabolic pathways, thereby enhancing its survival upon disinfectant exposure. Understanding these enzymes can aid in the development of novel methods to controlL. monocytogenesinfections in the food industry. The major metabolic enzymes exhibiting differential expression in response to various disinfection treatments (H2O2, ClO2, O3, and PAW) are oxidoreductases, peptidases, transferases, and hydrolases (TableS3; Supporting Information: DataS2.3).

Oxidoreductases are a class of enzymes facilitating oxidation–reduction or redox reactions by transferring electrons between molecules (Nord2009). In these reactions, one substrate is oxidized and loses electrons, whereas the other is reduced and gains electrons. Common oxidoreductases include dehydrogenases, which remove hydrogen atoms (and thus electrons) from substrates, oxidases, which transfer electrons to oxygen molecules, and reductases, which catalyze the reduction of a substrate by adding electrons (Cárdenas‐Moreno et al.2023). These enzymes play critical roles in various biological processes, including cellular respiration, metabolism, and ROS detoxification. Oxidizing agents H2O2(ywnB), ClO2(lmo0521,lmo1789,lmo0669,lmo0613,lmo2572,lmo0761,lmo1433,lmo2426, andlmo2573), and O3(morAandLMOf2365_0583) upregulate the expression levels of oxidoreductase activity genes. However, O3(ssuEandbsaA) and PAW (adhE) decrease the expression levels of specific oxidoreductase genes inL. monocytogenes. Increased expression of oxidoreductases protects the cells against damage from ROS and other oxidizing agents (Ingram2018). These enzymes detoxify harmful oxidants and maintain the redox balance within the cells (Cheng et al.2017).

Transferases facilitate the transfer of functional groups from donors to acceptor molecules. These transferases can be categorized into several subclasses based on their functional groups, including methyltransferases,N‐acetyltransferases, glutathioneS‐transferases, sulfur transferases, transaminases, phosphotransferases, acyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, selenotransferases, and molybdenum‐ or tungsten‐transferases based on the functional groups they transfer (McDonald and Tipton2023). Transferases in bacteria play essential roles in various functions, including cellular detoxification (Allocati et al.2009), biosynthesis pathways of disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides; protein glycosylation (J. Schmid et al.2016), antimicrobial drug resistance; and bacterial capsule polymerization (Litschko et al.2024). H2O2treatment increases the expression of specific transferase genes, includinglmo0602andlmo0652. In contrast, O3treatment resulted in both an increase (LMOf2365_0152) and a decrease (ackA,dacA, andLMOf2365_0447) in the expression of some transferase genes. Some transferases in the bacterial antioxidant defense system protect against oxidative stress by neutralizing ROS and other oxidizing agents (Allocati et al.2009). The elevated expression of transferase genes induced by the oxidizing agents H2O2and O3suggests that the bacteria actively attempt to neutralize or modify the disinfectant molecules. These alterations in expression may indicate a shift in the cellular processing of metabolites or detoxification responses to oxidative stress.

Hydrolases are enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of chemical bonds (e.g., C–C, C–O, C–N, and C–S) by adding –H or –OH groups from H2O across the bond (Kermasha and Eskin2021). These hydrolytic enzymes participate in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, RNA processing, protein degradation, cell wall growth and remodeling, cell division, autolysis, peptidoglycan recycling, detoxification, and regulation of cell signaling pathways (Do et al.2020; Nardini et al.1999; Qi et al.2022). Expression levels of specific hydrolase activity genes (yocD,bds1, andlmo2266) inL. monocytogenesare upregulated in response to H2O2. ClO2and O3treatments both upregulate (ClO2:lmo1577,lmo0869,lmo2603,lmo0268,lmo0907,lmo1254,lmo0764,lmo0261, andlmo1728; O3:aguA) and downregulate (ClO2:lmo0998,lmo2450, andlmo1240; O3:LMOf2365_0277,LMOf2365_0523, andLMOf2365_0341) specific hydrolase activity gene levels inL. monocytogenes. Peptidoglycan hydrolases play a role in cell‐wall remodeling and turnover. These enzymes may help to modify the cell wall structure to reduce disinfectant penetration during stress (Lee and Huang2013). Some hydrolases may directly inactivate or modify disinfectant molecules, helping bacteria detoxify and survive during treatment. These changes suggest potential alterations in the cell wall or detoxification response to oxidative stress (F. Zhang and Cheng2022).

Peptidases, also known as proteases, catalyze the breakdown of peptide bonds through a process called hydrolysis. By cleaving these bonds, peptidases convert long protein molecules into smaller peptides or individual amino acids, which are essential for various biological processes, such as protein maturation, recycling, and cellular regulation (Potempa and Pike2004). They are crucial for bacterial growth, metabolism, and adaptation to various environments. These proteolytic enzymes have diverse structures, perform different biological roles, and can be found in the cytoplasm, attached to the cell membrane, or released into the surroundings (Nguyen et al.2019). The O3and PAW treatments showed varied effects on the expression of specific peptidase activity genes inL. monocytogenes, with some genes being upregulated (O3:pepT; PAW:iap) and others being downregulated (O3:srtA,LMOf2365_0284,LMOf2365_1945, andLMOf2365_0569; PAW:lspA). In contrast, ClO2(lmo1354,lmo1578,lmo1611,LMOf6854_0307, andLMOf6854_0278) upregulated the expression of specific genes. As peptidases may play an active role in breaking down and utilizing proteins, the differential expression of genes encoding these enzymes following disinfection indicates that bacteria may be attempting to manage damaged or misfolded proteins under challenging conditions.

Synthesis of biomolecules is a multistage process involving enzymatic conversion or combination of simple compounds to produce macromolecules or more intricate products in living organisms (Abdel‐Aziz et al.2017). This process of small molecule biosynthesis is crucial for bacteria as it allows the synthesis of various compounds necessary for their survival, growth, and interactions with the environment. Bacteria synthesize many small molecules, including vitamins, minerals, cofactors, organic acids, ketones, and alcohols (Coupat et al.2008; França et al.2014). Disinfection treatments (H2O2, ClO2, O3, and PAW) affect various small molecule biosynthesis pathways, such as cobalamin, EA, and PD utilization, pantothenate, MK, molybdenum cofactor, and heme biosynthesis, and myo‐inositol catabolic pathways (TableS4; Supporting Information: DataS2.4).

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) serves as a cofactor for enzymes crucial for various metabolic processes, such as methylation reactions in amino acid metabolism (e.g., methionine synthase) (Matthews2009), rearrangements in carbon metabolism (e.g., methylmalonyl‐CoA mutase) (Roth et al.1996), reduction reactions in nucleotide synthesis (e.g., ribonucleotide reductase) (Booker and Stubbe1993), and fermentation reactions during anaerobic fermentation (e.g., ethanol to acetate) (Buckel and Thauer2013). Cobalamin biosynthesis is a complex and tightly regulated process involving approximately 30 enzyme‐mediated steps. It is also influenced by environmental factors, such as oxygen and cobalt availability (Raux et al.2000). Levels of cobalamin metabolism gene clustercob‐cbiand EA and PD utilization operons (eutandpdu, respectively), which are part of CDGC, were upregulated by PAW. Levels of PD genepduX, cobalamin biosynthesis genescbiDandcbiH, andeutgeneseutB,eutC,eutE,eutH, andeutTwere also upregulated. In contrast, except forcbiGlevels,cobC,cobJ,cobK,cobA, andLMOf2365_1212levels were downregulated by O3. Theeutoperon uses EA as the carbon and nitrogen source, whereas thepduoperon is involved in PD metabolism. The enzymes involved in these pathways rely on cofactors derived from cobalamin, which are produced de novo throughcobandcbi(Anast et al.2020). CDGC activation enhances competitive fitness against commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and other environments. Sublethal exposure to specific disinfection treatments activates the CDGC signaling pathways, potentially increasing the expression levels of operons linked to host cell internalization and stress adaptation. This response further increases the virulence of persistent bacterial strains (Fernández‐Gómez et al.2023).

Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is a precursor of CoA, essential for many metabolic processes in bacteria (Leonardi and Jackowski2007). CoA is a vital cofactor for cell growth and integral to numerous metabolic processes, including phospholipid metabolism, FAS and fatty acid breakdown, nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, and the TCA cycle (Spry et al.2008). Levels ofpanB, the coaxgene required for pantothenate biosynthesis and CoA, are downregulated by O3treatment (TableS3). Pantothenate biosynthesis is linked to other metabolic pathways, including branched‐chain amino acid biosynthesis and nucleotide metabolism pathways (Leonardi and Jackowski2007; Primerano and Burns1983). Downregulation of several amino acid and nucleotide metabolism gene levels inL. monocytogenesby O3disinfection is correlated with the downregulation of the levels of genes involved in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (TablesS2 and S3). This suggests that the oxidizing agent O3inhibits numerous metabolic processes essential for the survival ofL. monocytogenesthrough chain reactions.

MK (vitamin K2) plays a vital role in prokaryotes by facilitating electron transfer, ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation, and endospore formation (Das et al.1989; Hiratsuka et al.2008). MK is the primary component of the bacterial cell membrane and plays a crucial role in the aerobic and anaerobic respiration of many Gram‐positive bacteria. It facilitates the transfer of electrons between the enzymes, NADH dehydrogenase I and II, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome bc1–aa3 supercomplex, F0F1ATP synthase, cytochromebdoxidase, nitrate, and fumarate reductase (Boersch et al.2018; Kurosu and Begari2010). TheL. monocytogenesgenes involved in MK biosynthesis,menDandmenH, were upregulated by O3, whereasmenBandmenGwere downregulated by O3and PAW, respectively. These mixed responses indicate complex regulation of the respiratory chain during oxidative stress. As MK plays a central role in redox balance, changes in its biosynthesis affect electron transport and cellular energy status. MK biosynthesis is crucial for the survival of Gram‐positive bacteria (Truglio et al.2003), and inhibition of MK production leads to bactericidal effects, irrespective of the growth phase (Boersch et al.2018).

Mo is a trace element found in molybdoenzymes and plays a crucial role in essential cellular functions, including energy generation, detoxification reactions, and anaerobic fermentation (Zhong et al.2020). The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis pathway is conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Leimkühler2020). In bacteria, the pathway consists of four main steps: (i) formation of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) from GTP, (ii) insertion of two sulfur atoms into cPMP to form molybdopterin (MPT), (iii) insertion of molybdenum into MPT to form Moco, and (iv) additional modification of Moco to form dinucleotide variants (specific to bacteria) (Mendel and Leimkühler2015). This process involves the interactions of multiple proteins and requires iron, ATP, and copper. The key enzymes/proteins involved include MoaA and MoaC for cPMP formation; MoaD, MoaE, and MoeB for MPT synthesis; and MogA and MoeA for molybdenum insertion (Hasnat et al.2024). MPT synthase catalytic subunitmoeEand MPT molybdenum transferasemoeAwere upregulated and downregulated by O3, respectively. Molybdoenzymes in bacteria are primarily regulated by anaerobiosis and require iron. The transcription factor fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) requires a [4Fe‐4S] cluster for binding (Hasnat et al.2024). MoaA contains a [4Fe‐4S] cluster and directly connects the Moco biosynthesis pathway to the formation of iron‐sulfur (Fe‐S) clusters (Yokoyama and Leimkühler2015). A feedback regulation mechanism controls the transcription of themoaoperon genes. When MPT accumulates in the cells, it triggers a molybdenum cofactor riboswitch. This mechanism allows the bacteria to adapt to environmental changes (Regulski et al.2008). The increasedmoeEexpression inL. monocytogenesin response to O3potentially enhances its tolerance to oxidative stress (Cai et al.2023).

Heme is a complex ring composed of porphyrins and iron. It is a redox‐active component essential for the function of several cellular proteins (Choby and Skaar2016). Hemoproteins rely on heme and are involved in energy production and immune responses. Heme plays a crucial role in cellular respiration and acts as an electron carrier in the electron transport chain (Shimizu et al.2019). It is also essential for several cellular functions, including signaling, cellular differentiation, and miRNA processing (Choby and Skaar2016; Faller et al.2007). Levels oflmo2133, which encodes an isomer‐type heme‐degrading monooxygenase, are upregulated by ClO2. In contrast, levels of theisdGgene (iron‐containing steroidogenic enzyme) are downregulated by O3. Heme oxygenase catalyzes heme degradation to form biliverdin in the presence of an electron donor, releasing iron, which allowsL. monocytogenesto utilize the host heme as an iron source (Duong et al.2014). Heme oxygenase plays crucial roles in maintaining iron homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress by breaking down heme (Alavi et al.2018).

Transcription is the fundamental process of copying genetic information from DNA to RNA, producing proteins essential for biological functions (Boyle2005). RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the key enzyme responsible for this process, which involves initiation, elongation, and termination. In bacteria, a single RNAP enzyme performs all transcriptional functions, tightly regulating the process to allow the cells to adapt to environmental changes and effectively manage gene expression (Wilson et al.2018). O3treatment ofL. monocytogenesdownregulated the levels of RNAP subunitrpoB, transcription factorstsfandLMOf2365_1316, and other components of the transcription machinery, includingtrmL,rny, andcodY(TableS5).

Bacteria use mRNA transcribed from DNA to produce proteins through a process known as translation. This process occurs in the ribosome and involves several key steps, including initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling (Arenz and Wilson2016). Ribosomal biogenesis is an intricate process involving ribosome assembly that is crucial for protein synthesis (Davis and Williamson2017). Disinfection treatments differentially regulate the genes associated with ribosomal biogenesis and translation. O3and ClO2treatments differentially affect the expression levels of translational machinery genes inL. monocytogenes, upregulating some genes (O3:rpmI,rpiB, andrnaJ; ClO2:rplY,def,mecA,groEL,groES,rsgA1,lmo2511,lmo1502,lmo1218, andlmo1703) and downregulating others (O3:rsmE,rpmG,rpsB, andmecA; ClO2:rplM,rpmF2,rpmG2,rpmH,rpsB,rpsJ,rsmG,bipA,ychF,gatA,lepA,metG, andmnmE). In contrast, H2O2and PAW treatments downregulated the levels of specific genes (rpsPandrnjB, respectively).

Ribosomal biogenesis and translation are crucial processes ensuring the synthesis of proteins essential for the cellular functions and survival of bacteria. Roller et al. (2016) demonstrated the correlations between the number of ribosomal RNA operons (rrn) and growth rate and stability. They reported that, when the rrn copy number doubles, the maximum reproductive rate of bacteria also doubles, with the rate and yield of protein production reflecting the general trend in maximum growth rate and efficiency (Roller et al.2016). Increased expression levels of ribosomal genes inL. monocytogenesfollowing disinfection lead to enhanced ribosome production. This is crucial for protein synthesis and cellular repair, enabling the pathogen to rapidly produce proteins vital for stress responses. Transcriptional changes in ribosomal genes possibly reflect the cellular responses to stress, including protein synthesis adjustments, to supportL. monocytogenessurvival and repair under disinfection stress.

L. monocytogenesharbors several transporters playing crucial roles in various cellular processes and facilitating its adaptation to different environments, thereby contributing to its pathogenicity and survival. The major transporters affected by disinfection treatments include multidrug efflux transporters, phosphoenolpyruvate‐dependent PTS, metal ion transporters, and amino acid and protein transporters. Among these transporters, several genes belonging to the PTS system were differentially expressed in response to the reviewed disinfection treatments (TableS6; Supporting Information: DataS2.6).

PTS, a sugar‐specific transport system that simultaneously phosphorylates and transports various sugars into the cell, is crucial for carbohydrate transport and metabolism (Casey et al.2014). Levels oflmo0781,lmo0915,lmo1255,lmo2000,lmo2373,lmo2650, andlmo1254, and several other genes belonging to the IIA component of the mannose/fructose/sorbose family PTS are upregulated by ClO2treatment. In contrast, H2O2(bglC,bglH, andlmo0785) and O3(celB,LMOf2365_0537,LMOf2365_0660,LMOf2365_0798,LMOf2365_0937,LMOf2365_2023,LMOf2365_2344,LMOf2365_2621,LMOf2365_2664, andLMOf2365_2774) reduce the expression levels of several PTS system‐related genes. PAW treatment decreases the expression levels of PTS‐type galactitol (gatA,gatB, andgatC), cellobiose (catA,catB, andcatC), and mannose (manYandmanR) genes. Carbon sources fructose, galactitol (sugar alcohol derived from galactose hydrogenation), and cellobiose (disaccharide produced by cellulose hydrolysis) are essential precursors for cell wall biosynthesis inL. monocytogenes(Popowska et al.2012). PTS downregulation under PAW treatment restricts the absorption and use of these carbohydrates, allowing the pathogen to conserve energy and resources for other stress response mechanisms.

Bacterial multidrug efflux transporters contribute to the ability of bacteria to resist and expel toxic compounds, including disinfectants, antibiotics, and heavy metals. Tolerance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and antibiotics mediated by multidrug efflux transporters has been reported inL. monocytogenes(Mata et al.2000; Romanova et al.2006). Levels ofebrAandqacCare upregulated in response to PAW treatment. QacC is a small multidrug resistance family efflux transporter that is a part of thebcrABCcassette, which primarily confers tolerance to QACs inL. monocytogenes(He et al.2022). Upregulation of multidrug efflux transporter gene (qacH,qacC, andebrA) levels by BZT indicates an adaptive mechanism to actively expel the disinfectant molecules from bacterial cells, thereby reducing their intracellular accumulation and toxicity.

Metal ion transporters in bacteria play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of intracellular metal ion homeostasis, regulation of gene expression, response to oxidative stress, and virulence (Abrantes et al.2011). BothmntBandmntRlevels are upregulated in response to PAW treatment. H2O2downregulates the expression ofmntH. Manganese is involved in ROS detoxification and is essential for the oxidative stress responses in bacteria (Juttukonda and Skaar2015). Mn transporters regulate the levels of Mn inside cells and shield the bacteria from oxidative stress (Jakubovics and Jenkinson2001). The increased expression of manganese transporter genes inL. monocytogenesfollowing PAW treatment indicates enhanced manganese uptake, which is crucial for the oxidative stress response, acid tolerance, and other stress adaptation mechanismsin L. monocytogenes(Juttukonda and Skaar2015).

Bacteria use different transport mechanisms to uptake amino acids and oligopeptides. These include ATP‐binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are divided into subfamilies, such as polar and hydrophobic amino acid transport families (Hosie and Poole2001), and sodium‐dependent and independent systems (Landick et al.1985). ABC transporters use ATP hydrolysis to transport solutes across cellular membranes. Recent studies have identified six transporters facilitating the uptake of amino acids and oligopeptides inL. monocytogenes, thereby aiding the survival and replication of this bacterium (Joseph et al.2006; Schauer et al.2010). InL. monocytogenes, H2O2increases the expression levels ofbilEA,bilEB, andpbuX. Simultaneously,secA1andgadClevels were elevated by ClO2and PAW, respectively. Levels ofyrhGanddtpTdecreased in response to H2O2and PAW, respectively.L. monocytogenesBilE protein, encoded bybilEAandbilEB, resembles an ABC importer, and contributes to virulence and stress responses by transporting QACs (Ruiz et al.2016). PAW treatment decreases the pH levels, indicating increased acidity due to the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species interacting with water molecules to generate protons (H+) (Jirešová et al.2022). ThegadCgene encodes a glutamate/GABA antiporter in bacteria, which is essential for the glutamate‐dependent acid resistance system (Tsai et al.2013). GadC promotes the exchange of deprotonated glutamate (Glu–) for protonated GABA+across the cell membrane, effectively expelling protons and preventing their influx into the cell. Through the upregulation ofgadClevels by PAW,L. monocytogenesenhances its ability to thrive under acidic conditions by maintaining an intracellular pH balance.

Stress refers to the genomic, proteomic, and environmental changes reducing the growth rate and survival of an organism (Vorob'eva2004). Sensing and responding to environmental signals are crucial for the adaptability and survival of bacterial pathogens (Guerreiro et al.2020). Foodborne pathogens adjust their cellular processes to survive and grow under stress conditions (Sibanda and Buys2022).L. monocytogenesencounters various physical and chemical challenges impeding its growth and survival throughout the food chain. This pathogen is primarily known for its ability to persist and thrive in food production environments (Sibanda and Buys2022). Notably, enhanced QAC tolerance is observed inL. monocytogenesisolates persisting for over 4 years in such environments (Aase et al.2000). Many genes involved in stress responses, including those encoding the general stress response proteins, cold shock proteins (Csps), and heat shock proteins (Hsps), and those related to temperature, osmotic, cell envelope stress, oxidative stress, antibiotics, radiation, DNA damage, signal peptide processing, protein quality control, and homeostasis, were differentially regulated by the reviewed disinfection treatments (TableS7; Supporting Information: DataS2.7).

General stress response proteins comprise a group of proteins that allow the bacteria to withstand various types of stress, including oxidative, acidic, and osmotic stress. Stressosome is a large bacterial protein complex that detects environmental stress and activates a general stress response (Martinez‐Bond et al.2025). Upon stressosome activation, RsbT is released, which activates σB, a crucial regulator of the stress response managing over 300 genes related to stress resilience and virulence (Guerreiro et al.2020). O3treatment reducesprli42gene expression, which encodes the stressosome‐associated protein Prli42, inL. monocytogenes. This membrane‐anchored miniprotein is crucial for σB activation and essential for bacterial growth and survival under oxidative stress. Prli42 conveys the environmental stress signals to the stressomes (Impens et al.2017).

Disinfection treatments regulate several cold‐ and heat‐shock proteins in different ways. Csps are highly conserved small nucleic acid‐binding proteins involved in stress tolerance mechanisms (Muchaamba et al.2021). Csp genescspA, cspB, andcspDare induced upon exposure to various stresses, including cold, osmotic, oxidative, and desiccation. Csp gene levels inL. monocytogenesare upregulated in response to ClO2(cspB,cspD, andltrC) and O3(cspD) treatment. Csps possibly counteract the harmful effects of stress by preserving cellular functions, such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, thereby ensuring cell survival and growth (B. Schmid et al.2009). Csps also play a role in biofilm formation and motility, which are critical for the persistence and transmission ofL. monocytogenesin food‐processing environments (Eshwar et al.2017). Similarly, heat shock response is a crucial process allowing the bacteria to survive and adapt to harsh environmental conditions. In response to temperature changes, heat shock response triggers the production of several proteins, known as Hsps (Maleki et al.2016). Hsps primarily assist in proper protein folding and participate in the repair or degradation of misfolded proteins and harmful aggregates. When temperatures suddenly increase, Hsps rapidly accumulate in the cells. After the organism adapts, these protein levels decrease but remain elevated above their original baseline, facilitating bacterial growth even under suboptimal conditions (Roncarati and Scarlato2017). ClO2increases the expression levels of Hsp‐related genesdnaKandgrpE. Upregulation of Csp and Hsp levels inL. monocytogenesrepresents a stress adaptation mechanism that enhances the ability of the pathogen to survive and grow under the specific treatment conditions (B. Schmid et al.2009).

Disinfectants often generate ROS and activate genes to combat oxidative stress, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Increased expression ofsigB‐dependent genes by oxidizing agents H2O2,O3,and ClO2enablesL. monocytogenesto activate genes protecting it from acid and oxidative stress. For instance, ClO2exposure increases the expression levels of oxidative stress response genessodA,ohrA,spxA,spxH,lmo0906, andlmo0983inL. monocytogenes, enabling it to combat oxidative stress. Other disinfection treatments, such as H2O2(ohrR,ohrA,sodA, andgpo) and O3(sodA), also increase the levels of oxidative response genes. Levels of thesodAgene, which encodes SOD, are consistently upregulated by all oxidizing agents. SOD is an antioxidant enzyme playing an essential role in protecting cells from oxidative damage (Zheng et al.2023). SOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide (O2•−) into oxygen and H2O2, transforming the highly reactive superoxide radical into less harmful substances (Manso et al.2020). The increased expression of oxidative stress response genes enablesL. monocytogenesto counteract the detrimental effects of oxidative damage caused by ROS (Bucur et al.2018) from disinfectants, such as H2O2, O3, and ClO2, thereby improving its survival under oxidative stress.

Bacteria can adapt to chemical stress induced by toxic substances. Excessive or improper disinfectant application decreases their susceptibility and increases their tolerance (Rozman et al.2021; van Dijk and Verbrugh2022). Bacterial regulatory networks typically exhibit distinct changes in response to physical or chemical stresses, such as insufficient nutrient availability, elevated temperatures, disinfectants, and antibiotics (LeRoux et al.2015). Danger sensing is the ability to identify external substances posing a threat to the organism. Levels of phosphate regulator genephoU(ClO2), arsenic resistance genelmo2230(H2O2and ClO2), and toxin resistance geneslmo2570(ClO2) andlmo1708(ClO2) are upregulated inL. monocytogenesin response to disinfection. In contrast, PAW downregulates thephoUand toxin resistance genetelA1levels. The two‐component regulatory system is crucial for signal transduction, allowing bacteria to sense and respond to changes in various environmental conditions (Casado et al.2022). In bacteria, the two‐component regulatory system governs the phosphate (Pho) regulon, with PhoU as its key negative regulator (Santos‐Beneit2015). PhoU is a crucial regulator of persister cell development. Its inactivation leads to the loss of persisters, resulting in increased sensitivity to antibiotics and stress (Y. Li and Zhang2007).Escherichia coliPhoU mutant cannot suppress the metabolic processes necessary for persister formation, thereby showing increased susceptibility (Y. Li and Zhang2007).

Bacteria respond to agents causing DNA damage by activating the SOS response, which contributes to DNA repair (Arcari et al.2020). Disinfection treatments H2O2(dinB,uvrA,uvrB,recA,lexA,exoA,addA,addB,lmo0157,lmo2222,lmo2050, andlmo1639) and ClO2(fri,deoC, andlmo1514). RecA plays a crucial role in DNA repair and acts as a key activator of the SOS response inL. monocytogenes(Van Der Veen et al.2010). RecA filaments bind to single‐stranded DNA, triggering the self‐cleavage of LexA, an SOS regulon repressor. Cleaved LexA is further processed by ClpXP bacterial proteases, which activate the SOS pathway (Cohn et al.2011). This leads to a temporary halt in cell division, allowing DNA repair (Walker1996). Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is another highly conserved multistep DNA recognition and repair process mediated by the UvrABC repair system (Truglio et al.2004). UvrA detects damage and forms the heterotrimeric complex, UvrA2UvrB, with UvrB (Theis et al.2000). UvrB is a central component of the bacterial NER system, participating in damage recognition, strand excision, and repair synthesis (Verhoeven et al.2002). LexA and DnaA proteins regulate the transcription ofuvrB(NER system),dinJ(antitoxin component of a type II toxin‐antitoxin system), andrecN(DNA double‐strand break repair) inE. coli, thereby influencing the SOS regulon (Wurihan et al.2018). SOS response ofL. monocytogenesplays a role in its survival under various stressors, further contributing to its persistence in the environment (Van Der Veen et al.2010).

In addition to inducing DNA damage, disinfection stress leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins, which must be eliminated by the cellular proteolytic systems.L. monocytogenesuses stress regulators and response genes to manage oxidative stress. Most stress response genes are regulated by SigB factors, includingctsR, which represses the caseinolytic protease (clp) operon under optimal conditions. CLP proteins, including both chaperones and proteases, are activated as a survival strategy under temperature and stress conditions (Manso et al.2020). Clp ATPases are a large family of related proteins playing key housekeeping roles, including in protein reactivation, remodeling, and targeting of specific proteins for degradation by ClpP peptidase (Lemos and Burne2002). ClO2(clpB,clpC,clpP,clpX, andctsR) and PAW (clpP) increase the expression levels of Clp protease genes. ClpP is a tetradecameric peptidase degrading misfolded proteins aided by chaperones, such as ClpC and ClpX (Baker and Sauer2012). The ClpXP complex plays crucial roles in protein quality control, SOS responses, and virulence inL. monocytogenes(Balogh et al.2022). ClpX, a hexameric ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) and ATP‐driven chaperone, identifies protein substrates and channels unfolded peptide chains into the tetradecameric barrel of the ClpP serine protease for breakdown (Baker and Sauer2012).L. monocytogenespossesses two ClpP isoforms, ClpP1 and ClpP2, which form a heterooligomeric complex with enhanced proteolytic activity. ClpP1 enhances degradation efficiency, whereas ClpP2 facilitates ClpX binding and functions as a substrate gatekeeper (Balogh et al.2022). Regulation ofclpgenes is mediated by CtsR, which represses stress response gene expression (Wiktorczyk‐Kapischke et al.2021).

Bacterial chemotaxis is a phenomenon by which bacteria sense changes in the chemical composition of their environment via chemoreceptors and migrate toward a favorable environment (Bren and Eisenbach2000). Motility is a crucial feature allowing the bacteria to search for nutrients and avoid toxic compounds. Bacteria have to adapt to various stressors, including antibiotics and disinfectants, to survive (Piskovsky and Oliveira2023). Particularly, disinfection significantly alters the regulation of several key genes involved in chemotaxis and flagellar biosynthesis (TableS8; Supporting Information: DataS2.8).

Chemotaxis plays vital roles in various biological processes, including stress responses, biofilm formation, QS, bacterial pathogenesis, and host infection (Karmakar2021). Methyltransferase enzyme CheR plays a crucial role in chemotaxis, enabling bacteria to sense and respond to their environment by modifying the chemotaxis receptors. It regulates the chemotaxis pathway by modulating the methylation state of methyl‐accepting chemotaxis proteins in response to chemotactic gradients. O3and PAW treatments increase the expression levels ofcheRinL. monocytogenes. Upregulation of chemotactic gene levels by O3and PAW treatment helpsL. monocytogenesto navigate toward more favorable environments for survival. In contrast, ClO2treatment decreases the expression levels of chemotactic geneslmo1699andlmo0693inL. monocytogenes, limiting its potential to sense and respond to the stress caused by these treatments.

Flagella are motile chemotactic devices facilitating bacterial survival, adaptation, and pathogenesis (O'Neil and Marquis2006). O3(flgEandmogR) and PAW (fliH,flgE, andfliI) treatments increase the expression levels of genes responsible for flagellar assembly. Conversely, ClO2(flgD,fliK, andfliQ) and H2O2(fliP) treatments decrease the expression levels of flagellar genes. O3treatment also suppresses the expression of specific genes (motB,fliN,flgB,fliE, andfliF) inL. monocytogenes. Many chemotaxis genes, such ascheA,cheY, and methyl‐accepting chemotaxis protein genes, coordinate with the flagellar assembly genes to support bacterial motility. Y. Li and Zhang (2007) identified a correlation between the increased expression levels of several genes related to flagella and chemotaxis and the absence of the negative regulator, PhoU, inE. coli. Consistently, downregulation ofphoUlevels by PAW treatment increased the expression levels of chemotaxis and flagellar genes. Conversely, upregulation ofphoUgenes by ClO2decreased these gene levels. These patterns suggest regulatory interactions between PhoU and motility genes that affect bacterial adaptation and energy expenditure under stress. Y. Li and Zhang (2007) further proposed that the loss of the negative regulator PhoU increases cellular metabolic activity, thereby enhancing susceptibility to various antibiotics and stressors.

Motility and flagellar gene expression levels inL. monocytogenesare strongly regulated by temperature. These gene levels are generally upregulated at environmental temperatures (≤ 30°C) and repressed at 37°C by the transcriptional repressor MogR (Ivy et al.2010; Shen and Higgins2006). This repression is halted at low temperatures by the anti‐repressor, GmaR, which acts as a thermosensor but becomes inactive or aggregates at high temperatures (Kamp and Higgins2009,2011). In this review, we compared disinfection treatments across various temperatures, ranging from 20°C (H2O2) to 37°C (ClO2). Therefore, the variations in flagellar gene expression patterns indicated here reflect both the disinfection treatment and baseline regulatory influence of the incubation temperature.

QS is a bacterial signaling mechanism enabling cell–cell communication within and between species by producing, detecting, and responding to the extracellular signaling molecules, known as autoinducers (AIs) (Ismail et al.2016). This mechanism enables bacteria to regulate their gene expression, metabolic activity, and behaviors in response to variations in population density, thereby inducing biofilm formation (Preda and Săndulescu2019; Rutherford and Bassler2012). Expression levels of virulence factors, such as adhesins, internalins, surface proteins (e.g., ActA), siderophores, hemolysins (e.g., listeriolysin O), phospholipases, and toxins, and survival within host cells significantly influence the severity ofL. monocytogenesinfection (Coelho et al.2018). Disinfection procedures influence multiple QS‐ and virulence‐related genes (TableS9; Supporting Information: DataS2.9), indicating their potential effects on bacterial communication and pathogenic traits.

QS is an intercellular communication mechanism regulating gene expression across cellular processes (Waters and Bassler2005). It is essential for bacterial adaptation and survival under different environmental conditions during infection, processing, and transmission (Banerji et al.2022). PAW increases the levels of accessory gene regulator (agr)‐B, whereas ClO2upregulates the levels ofluxS, which synthesizes AI‐2. Theagrsystem is crucial for both biofilm formation and virulence and facilitates adaptation to changing environments (Zetzmann et al.2016). InL. monocytogenes,agrBis essential for processing the precursor peptide fromagrDto the mature autoinducing peptide (Rieu et al.2007). Autoinducing peptide activates histidine kinase AgrC, which phosphorylates and activates response regulator AgrA, thereby regulating the genes associated with biofilm formation and virulence (Riedel et al.2009). TheagrBDCAoperon is autoregulated, exhibiting higher expression levels during biofilm growth than during the planktonic or early attachment phases (Zetzmann et al.2016).luxSencodes the LuxS enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of AI‐2, a universal signaling molecule sensed by various bacterial species, facilitating interspecies communication. Communication enables bacteria to coordinate behaviors, such as biofilm formation, virulence, and antibiotic resistance (Wang et al.2019). PAW and ClO2treatments upregulate the QS gene (agrBandluxS) levels, enhancing biofilm formation. This biofilm protectsL. monocytogenesfrom disinfectants by forming a physical barrier and modifying the internal microenvironment.

TheprfAvirulence gene cluster (pVGC) is the primary pathogenicity island inL. monocytogenes, comprisingprfA,plcA,hly,mpl,actA, andplcB. Levels of pVGC and other virulence factor genes are decreased by O3(comGB, ESAT‐6‐like secretion system [ess]‐A,essC,lmaC,plcA,actA,LMOf2365_0374,LMOf2365_0909,LMOf2365_1977, andLMOf2365_2034) and PAW (actA). In contrast, H2O2(lhrCandlisK), PAW (inlAandiap), and O3(lysR,lmaD, andepsC) increase specific gene levels inL. monocytogenes.essAandessCare part of the ESS or type VII secretion system in Gram‐positive bacteria. This system is crucial for the identification and secretion of proteins enhancing virulence and bacterial competition (Zoltner et al.2016; Burts et al.2005). The ActA protein ofL. monocytogenesplays a crucial role as a virulence factor. Actin polymerization is initiated on the bacterial surface, forming an actin tail that enables bacteria to move within and between the host cells (Pillich et al.2017).lisKencodes the LisK protein, a histidine kinase in the LisRK two‐component system, inL. monocytogenes. This protein is crucial for the adaptation of organisms to environmental stresses, such as ethanol and oxidative stress (Alejandro‐Navarreto and Freitag2024). Virulence gene expression changes enhance disinfection resistance by improving the stress tolerance, suppressing biofilm formation, and altering the cell surface properties in Gram‐positive pathogens (Frees et al.2004; Rouhi et al.2024; Kastbjerg et al.2010). These varying transcriptional responses show that disinfection treatments either inhibit or stimulate virulence‐related pathways, influencing the ability ofL. monocytogenesto persist under, adapt to, or withstand stress, depending on the environmental conditions.

Virulence gene expression inL. monocytogenesis regulated by temperature‐dependent mechanisms. Levels of genes within pVGC, includingactA,plcA, andhly, are generally upregulated at 37°C but remain low at low temperatures. This control is mediated by a thermosensitive RNA structure in the 5′‐untranslated region ofprfA, which unfolds at 37°C to allow translation (Johansson et al.2002; Loh et al.2012). Consequently, ClO2treatment at 37°C induces a greater baseline expression of virulence genes compared to that at low temperatures (e.g., H2O2at 20°C; PAW at room temperature). This partially explains the variability in virulence gene expression under different treatments.

This review summarizes the overall genetic activity ofL. monocytogenesunder different disinfection treatments. Gene expression changes inL. monocytogenesin response to different disinfectants provide valuable insights into the cellular mechanisms of this foodborne pathogen under stress conditions. However, the limited number of studies onL. monocytogenesresponses to disinfection treatments makes it difficult to conclude that this pathogen responds solely in the discussed manner. Moreover, this review article has several limitations resulting from the types of disinfection treatments selected for comparison. One major issue is the variability in the treatment conditions (Table1) applied toL. monocytogenes, which complicates the interpretation of results and identification of specific patterns related to particular conditions. Additionally, most discussed studies did not document the nature of the bacteria (bactericidal, bacteriostatic, or exhibiting reduced growth) during RNA isolation for transcriptomic analyses. For instance, populations ofL. monocytogenesafter treatment with BZT (Casey et al.2014), LA, and H2O2(Cortes et al.2020) were not recorded. Moreover, the substrate or medium used forL. monocytogenesdisinfection varied among the selected studies. For example, O3was applied to the surface of tomatoes, whereas BZT, LA, H2O2, and HPP were applied toL. monocytogenessuspended in TSB or the tryptone soy yeast extract broth. ClO2and PMF were applied toL. monocytogenessuspended in the brain heart infusion broth and phosphate‐buffered saline, respectively.

Each experiment included in our analysis was conducted under different temperature conditions, which may have influenced the growth kinetics and stress responses ofL. monocytogenes(Poimenidou et al.2023). Temperature is a critical factor affecting both the efficacy of chemical oxidants and the physiological resilience of bacterial cells (Gélinas et al.1984; Manso et al.2020). Additionally, differentL. monocytogenesstrains from multiple serotypes, such as 1/2a, 1/2c, and 4b, have been used in various studies (Table1). Considering the well‐documented genetic and phenotypic diversity ofL. monocytogenesstrains, including differences in their stress tolerance and virulence, this variability further complicates the interpretation of the results (Nightingale et al.2005; Muchaamba et al.2022). However, it is important to note that only a small number of strains were evaluated in the studies discussed, which limits how well the findings apply to the broaderL. monocytogenespopulation. Collectively, these differences make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the typical responses ofL. monocytogenesto the chemical oxidants discussed in this review.

In addition to the disinfection treatments and bacterial conditions, the methods used for transcriptome analysis, such as RNA‐sequencing and microarray analysis, also varied among the included studies. Moreover, the fold change (FC) threshold, an important factor to accurately compare the transcriptomic responses ofL. monocytogenesunder different treatment conditions, varied across studies. For example, DEGs inL. monocytogenestreated with BZT were analyzed using FC thresholds ≥ 7.5 (Fox et al.2011) and ≥ 4 (Casey et al.2014). In contrast, with LA, H2O2, and PAW treatments, DEGs were identified using log2 FC > 1. Studies using low FC thresholds identified many DEGs, including those showing minor expression changes. Conversely, studies with high FC thresholds only identified the genes exhibiting significant expression changes. These varying FC cutoff points affected the results, impacting their accurate comparison and interpretation.

Results interpretation under different experimental conditions requires careful analysis and assessment. Investigation of a specific technique under bactericidal, bacteriostatic, and reduced growth conditions can reveal the differences in gene expression. Thorough analysis is necessary when significant variations are observed. For instance, comparative analysis of their behaviors in biofilm‐forming environments and suspensions can provide insights into bacterial adaptive responses. Such meticulous analysis is crucial for understanding complex microbial behaviors and guiding future research on bacterial growth control.

Another limitation is that most transcriptomic studies ofL. monocytogenesunder oxidative stress conditions, as mentioned in this paper, use short exposure times—often ranging from 5 min to 1 h, which primarily capture the bacterium's initial adaptive responses rather than its fully developed physiological states and do not address the persistence of these transcriptional changes. These early responses involve the rapid upregulation of general stress response genes, such as those controlled by alternative sigma factors (e.g.,sigB), chaperones, and noncoding RNAs, which help reduce immediate damage and prepare the cell for survival (Cortes et al.2020; Anast and Schmitz‐Esser2020). However, these transcriptional changes are usually temporary and might not accurately reflect the long‐term regulatory adjustments, metabolic reprogramming, or structural changes needed for sustained stress tolerance (Bren et al.2023; Kratz and Banerjee2024). Furthermore, the transient activation of these stress responses could lead to cross‐protection, where sublethal exposure to an oxidant preadapts the bacterium to tolerate subsequent, unrelated stresses (e.g., acid, osmotic, or thermal stress) that it encounters later (Ferreira et al.2003; Lou and Yousef1997). Additionally, many stress‐induced gene expression changes are reversible; the final physiological state of the cell depends on the duration and intensity of the stress, as well as post‐transcriptional, translational, and post‐translational regulatory layers (Roemhild et al.2022; Papadimitriou et al.2016). Therefore, relying on short‐term transcriptome data may overemphasize early responses while underestimating the complexity of ongoing adaptation mechanisms, highlighting the need for integrated time‐course and multiomics studies to fully understand the stress physiology ofL. monocytogenes.

Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge that transcriptomic data alone do not necessarily confirm the functional significance of gene expression changes. Although stress triggers rapid and widespread changes in gene transcription (e.g., via SigB), the actual protein levels or subsequent metabolic activity often do not correlate with mRNA abundance due to post‐transcriptional, translational, and post‐translational regulation (Sibanda and Buys2022; Chaturongakul et al.2008). While proteomic studies onL. monocytogenesunder oxidative stress are currently limited, some research suggests that there may be a poor correlation between mRNA levels and corresponding protein expression under stress conditions (Johansson and Freitag2019). This includes regulation by RNA‐binding proteins (such as Hfq), small RNAs, mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and protein degradation rates (Seixas et al.2025). Additionally, extrinsic biological noise and environmental fluctuations further contribute to the disconnect between transcript and protein levels. As a result, relying solely on transcriptomic data may misrepresent the actual physiological state ofL. monocytogenesunder stress. This underscores the importance of integrating proteomic analyses to achieve a comprehensive understanding of bacterial adaptation and survival mechanisms (Bowman et al.2012; Chaturongakul et al.2008). Combining data from transcriptomic studies with proteomic and functional assays would offer a more accurate depiction of the pathogen's survival strategies.

L. monocytogenescan adapt to and survive under disinfection stress, posing significant challenges for the food industry. This review highlights its complex transcriptional responses to various chemical oxidants. Oxidizing agents (e.g., ClO2, H2O2, and O3) induce strong oxidative stress responses (e.g.,sodAandohrA) and activate DNA repair systems (recAanduvrABC) inL. monocytogenes. Nonoxidizing treatments (e.g., BZT and HPP) upregulate the cell wall biosynthesis gene (murAandglmS) levels, hindering disinfectant penetration. Interestingly, sublethal exposure to some disinfectants unintentionally increases the virulence (inlAandlisK) and QS (agrBandluxS) gene levels, enhancing the adaptive tolerance ofL. monocytogenes. Changes in efflux pumps (qacCandebrA) and metabolic shifts (e.g., activation of PPP and glycerol utilization) further highlight the adaptability of this pathogen. However, variations in experimental conditions (e.g., disinfectant concentration and bacterial physiological state), transcriptomic analysis methods, and DEG thresholds across studies limit the comparability of the data. To enhance the disinfection efficacy, future studies should use standardized methodologies to investigate the pathogen responses under different conditions and states, including biofilm‐forming environments and the planktonic (suspended) state. A deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is critical to develop effective control measures againstL. monocytogenescontamination in food processing environments and prevent listeriosis.
