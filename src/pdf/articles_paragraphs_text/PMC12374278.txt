Gastric cancer patients are vulnerable to postoperative complications. Omega-3 fatty acids may improve immune function and reduce postoperative complications. However, the impacts of omega-3 fatty acids intervention on immune function and clinical outcomes in gastric cancer patients are not clear.

Seven databases were retrieved: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Yiigle. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2) was used to assess the risk of bias of included RCTs. RevMan software was used for data synthesis. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the stability of the results. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to explore the false-positive results and estimate the required information size (RIS).

Thirty-two RCTs involving 2,404 gastric cancer patients were included. Compared with the control group, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation significantly decreased the incidence of infectious complication (RR = 0.42; 95% CI, [0.32, 0.54];P<0.00001; I2= 0%), shortened the length of hospital stay (MD=-1.27 days; 95% CI [-2.10, -0.45];P= 0.002; I2= 67%), and elevated the level of CD4+T cell (MD = 4.96%; 95% CI, [3.49, 6.44];P<0.00001; I2= 84%). No significant difference was observed in in-hospital mortality between the two groups (RR = 0.54; 95% CI, [0.12, 2.42];P= 0.42; I2= 0%). Trial sequential analysis demonstrated that the conclusion on the primary outcome improvement is robust because it reached the required sample size and excluded the presence of false positive results. The GRADE assessment indicated moderate certainty of outcomes for infectious complications, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratio, and low certainty for in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay.

Omega-3 fatty acids intervention is associated with reduction of the occurrence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients and may improve immune function.

The protocol for our meta-analysis and systematic review was registered and recorded in PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42024562523).

Gastric cancer ranks the fifth in the diagnosis of malignancies and the fourth killer of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The incidence of gastric cancer among adults aged<50 years old has been rising rapidly in recent years in the world [1,2]. The high morbidity and mortality make it an important public health issue and burden [3]. Surgery is considered as the most significant treatment approach for gastric cancer, and also the foundation of eradicating gastric cancer [4,5]. But surgical resection disrupts the normal anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract and stimulates the systematic inflammatory response, which may expose patients to a constant state of hypermetabolism and immune dysregulation [6,7]. Therefore, gastric cancer patients are vulnerable to postoperative complications such as pneumonia and wound infections after surgical injury. As a result, the overall survival is adversely affected and the healthcare burden is increased [8].

As one main substrate of the immunonutrients, omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) exert significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by competing with omega-6 FAs metabolism, reducing pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. They also reduce proinflammatory cytokine production and modulate immune function [9–13]. Previous studies indicated that omega-3 supplementation is associated with alleviated inflammation and reduced postoperative complications in surgical patients, including those who underwent gastrointestinal surgeries [11–13]. Its beneficial role in inflammation and metabolism makes it theoretically promising to improve immune function and reduce postoperative complications of gastric cancer patients. According to the latest practical guidelines for clinical nutrition in surgery by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), perioperative or at least postoperative immunonutrition should be administrated in malnourished patients undergoing major cancer surgery because of the reduction of postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay (LOS) after major abdominal cancer surgery [14,15]. However, the guideline also points out that there is currently no clear evidence for the sole use of immunonutrition such as omega-3 fatty acids vs. standard nutritional supplements in the preoperative periods [14]. Considering that the sample size of a single trial is inadequate to provide valid evidence at present, we conducted this trial-sequential meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids for gastric cancer patients.

We designed and conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 [16]. The protocol for our meta-analysis and systematic review was registered and recorded in PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42024562523).

P (Participants): Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with gastric cancer and undergoing gastric cancer surgery.

To guarantee the reliability of retrieval, two reviewers (YHY and YXT) independently retrieved seven databases: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Yiigle. Studies published before June 30, 2024, that met the inclusion criteria were included. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, all Chinese-language studies included in this meta-analysis underwent rigorous screening and data extraction by bilingual researchers (YHY and YXT). This approach minimizes language bias and enhances the comprehensiveness of evidence synthesis. The retrieval strategy is summarized in Supplementary file 1. Table S1.

To guarantee the integrity of data, two reviewers (YHY and YXT) independently conducted literature screening and data extraction following the PRISMA guidelines, and the third reviewer (LJY) independently double-checked the extracted data. Controversies were discussed and solved in the research team. Data extraction was performed using a standardized form in Microsoft Excel, which included study design, baseline patient information, statistics on infectious complication; secondary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (days), CD4+T cell (%), CD8+T cell (%) and ratio of CD4+/CD8+T cell. In cases where studies had missing or incomplete data for relevant outcomes, the studies were excluded from the analysis to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the pooled results. Additionally, to prevent overlap in patient cohorts, we cross-verified author affiliations, patient recruitment periods, and trial registration numbers across all included studies. No duplicated cohorts were identified.

To guarantee the reliability of this study, two reviewers (YHY and ZJC) independently assessed the risk of bias of RCTs with the aid of the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2) [17]. The assessment covered five dimensions: bias arising from the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurements, and selection of the reported result. Controversies were discussed and solved in the research team.

The pooling of variables was performed with the aid of the Cochrane Collaboration’s Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the Mantel-Haenszel method were used to present the effects of dichotomous variables. Continuous variables were pooled and presented as mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using the inverse variance method. The significant level α of statistics was set at 0.05. IfP< 0.05, statistical differences were considered significant. To account for heterogeneity, random-effects models were used when I2> 0 as a conservative threshold by incorporating both within-study and between-study variability. Fixed-effects models were used when I² = 0, as they assume homogeneity across studies. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the timing (perioperative; preoperative; postoperative), the route (PN; EN), and the period of interventions (<7 days, ≥ 7 days; ≤10 days, >10 days). Meta-regression analysis was conducted using the metafor package in R 4.3.1 to explore the impact of age and gender on heterogeneity. Publication bias was visualized by using funnel plots if the number of enrolled studies exceeded 10. And we utilized R 4.3.1 (metabias function in the meta package) to perform Egger’s regression to quantify the presence of publication bias. Besides, sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome was conducted to evaluate the stability and reliability of the results.

Some “positive” findings of meta-analysis may be caused by the random error rather than due to underlying “true” intervention effect. Trial sequential analysis is developed to explore the false-positive results arising from inadequate sample sizes or repetitive tests and estimate the required information size for meta-analysis. We performed TSA for primary outcomes using TSA version 0.9.5.10 Beta software. The parameters for type 1 error and power were set to 5% and 80%, respectively.

Based on the retrieval strategy, 5,950 records were retrieved. After processes of removing duplicates, screening titles and abstracts, 64 studies were retained for full-text screening. Finally, thirty-two RCTs involving 2,404 gastric cancer patients were included [19–50]. The sample sizes of the included RCTs ranged from 26 to 135. The basic characteristics of the included trials are presented in Supplementary file 1. Table S2. A flowchart of the screening process and results is shown in Fig.1.

Overall, most studies were at low risk in randomization process and selection of reported result. However, deviations from intended interventions and measurement for the outcome were found in many studies and may cause high risk of bias. These findings indicated that more methodological rigorous studies are needed. The plot of the risk of bias among the 32 RCTs is presented in Supplementary file 2. FigS1.

Twenty-four RCTs including 1,824 patients reported the incidence of infectious complication [20–31,34–36,38,39,41,43–46,48,50]. Pooled data indicated that omega-3 in gastric cancer patients was associated with a lower incidence of infectious complication than in the control group (RR = 0.42; 95% CI, [0.32, 0.54];P<0.00001; I2= 0%). The certainty of the evidence was deemed moderate. A forest plot of infectious complication is shown in Fig.2.

Nine RCTs, including 651 patients, reported the in-hospital mortality [20,22,24,27,29,38,45,48,50]. Pooled data indicated that no statistically significant difference in hospital mortality between the two groups (RR = 0.54; 95% CI, [0.12, 2.42];P= 0.42; I2= 0%). The certainty of the evidence was deemed low. A forest plot of in-hospital mortality is shown in Supplementary file 2. FigS2.

Nine RCTs, including 562 patients, reported the length of hospital stay [21,25,27,28,30,34,38,45,50]. The pooled data indicated that patients in the omega-3 group had shorter length of hospital stay (MD=−1.27 days; 95% CI [−2.10, −0.45];P= 0.002; I2= 67%). The certainty of the evidence was deemed low. A forest plot of length of hospital stay is shown in Supplementary file 2. FigS3.

Eleven RCTs, including 766 patients, reported the percentage of CD4+T cell [19,23,29,31,32,34,37,41,44,45,48]. The pooled data indicated that patients in the omega-3 group had higher levels of CD4+T cell (MD = 4.96%; 95% CI, [3.49, 6.44];P<0.00001; I2= 84%). The certainty of the evidence was deemed moderate. A forest plot of the CD4+T cell (%) is shown in Supplementary file 2. Fig S4.

Nine RCTs, including 562 patients, reported the percentage of CD8+T cell [19,23,29,31,32,34,44,45,48]. The pooled data indicated no statistically significant difference in the percentage of CD8+T cell between the two groups (MD=−0.89%; 95% CI, [−2.71, 0.93];P= 0.34; I2= 80%). The certainty of the evidence was deemed moderate. A forest plot of the CD8+T cell (%) is shown in Supplementary file 2. Fig S5.

Fourteen RCTs, including 976 patients, reported the value of CD4/CD8 [19,21,23,25,29,31,32,34,37,41,44,45,48,50]. The pooled data indicated that patients in the omega-3 group were associated with higher value of CD4/CD8 (MD = 0.37; 95% CI, [0.18, 0.56];P= 0.0002; I2= 96%). The certainty of the evidence was deemed moderate. A forest plot of the CD4/CD8 is shown in Supplementary file 2. Fig S6.

Based on the timing (perioperative; preoperative; postoperative), the route of nutritional support (PN; EN), and the period of interventions (<7 days, ≥ 7 days; ≤10 days, >10 days), we performed subgroup analyses of the primary outcome. In subgroup analysis of the timing of interventions, pooled results showed that omega-3 could significantly reduce the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients in preoperative (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, [0.27, 0.74];P= 0.002; I2= 0%) and postoperative interventions (RR = 0.39; 95% CI, [0.28, 0.54];P<0.00001; I2= 0%). In perioperative interventions, no significant difference was observed in infectious complications between the two groups (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, [0.20, 3.17];P= 0.76; I2= 0%). In subgroup analysis of the route of interventions, pooled results showed that omega-3 significantly reduced the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients compared to the control group in both parenteral (RR = 0.39; 95% CI, [0.28, 0.56];P<0.00001; I2= 0%) and enteral interventions (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, [0.30, 0.69];P= 0.0002; I2= 0%). In subgroup analysis of the period of interventions, pooled results showed that omega-3 significantly reduced the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients compared to the control group with an intervention period of <7 days (RR = 0.40; 95% CI, [0.26, 0.60];P<0.00001; I2= 18%) or ≥ 7 days (RR = 0.43; 95% CI, [0.30, 0.61];P<0.00001; I2= 0%). In subgroup analysis based on a boundary intervention period of 10 days, pooled data showed that omega-3 significantly reduced the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients compared to the control group with an intervention period of ≤ 10 days (RR = 0.41; 95% CI, [0.31, 0.53];P<0.00001; I2= 0%). Differently, there was no significant difference in infectious complications between the two groups with an intervention period of >10 days (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, [0.20, 3.17];P= 0.76; I2= 0%). Details of the subgroup analysis are shown in Supplementary file 2. Figs S7-10.

Funnel plots of the outcomes reported in more than 10 studies are shown in Supplementary file 2. Figs S11-13. The results of Egger’s regression indicated that no publication bias was observed for the outcomes of infectious complications (P= 0.0953; Intercept = 0.777) and CD4/CD8 ratio (P= 0.1129; Intercept = 0.670), while publication bias was detected for the outcome of CD4+T cell (P= 0.028; Intercept = 7.249). Details of Egger’s regression are shown in Supplementary file 1. Table S3.

Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the primary outcomes. Regarding the primary outcome, the exclusion of individual studies did not influence the overall pooled results. The details are shown in Supplementary file 2. Fig S14.

The results of meta-regression indicated that the age and gender in both the intervention and control groups showed no statistically effects on the effect size (P>0.05). This suggests that despite significant heterogeneity among four outcomes (length of hospital stay; CD4+T cell; CD8+T cell; CD4/CD8 ratio), age and gender are not the primary sources of heterogeneity. Details of meta-regression are shown in Supplementary file 1. Table S4.

The required information size (RIS) of the primary outcome was estimated to be 343 through TSA. The TSA of the primary outcome showed that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the no-boundary line and reached the RIS, which meant the result of the infectious complication was reliable. The details are shown in Fig.3.

We used GRADEpro to evaluate the certainty of the outcomes. The certainty of evidence for outcomes for infectious complication, CD4+T cell (%), CD8+T cell (%), and CD4/CD8 ratio were moderate. This rating was primarily due to limitations in study design, including the lack of reporting on whether outcome assessments were blinded in some studies. Despite these limitations, the moderate certainty of evidence supports the reliability of our findings for these outcomes, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids intervention is associated with reduction of the occurrence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients and may improve immune function. In addition, the certainty of evidence for in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay (days) was low. This rating was attributed to several factors: (1) the absence of reporting on whether outcome assessments were blinded in most enrolled studies (2), inconsistencies in the results across studies. The low certainty of evidence indicates that these findings should be interpreted with caution, and further high-quality studies with rigorous methodologies are needed to confirm these results. Overall, the overall certainty of evidence for this systematic review and meta-analysis was moderate, reflecting a balance between the strengths and limitations of the included studies. The details are summarized in Supplementary file 1. Table S5.

Gastric cancer patients are susceptible to postoperative complications because the wasting caused by carcinoma, stress of major surgery, inflammatory processes and dysfunctional metabolism after operation [51,52]. In addition, the above conditions also compromise the immune function. Therefore, to alleviate stress and maintain immune functions are crucial to improve the outcome of gastric cancer patients who have undergone operations [51,52]. According to the latest ESPEN guidelines, perioperative or at least postoperative supplements of immunonutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids are recommended. However, this recommendation is weakened by the lack of clear evidence for the sole use of omega-3 FAs vs. standard nutritional supplements in the preoperative period [14].

Our current systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation significantly decreased the incidence of infectious complication (RR = 0.42; 95% CI, [0.32, 0.54];P<0.00001; I2= 0%) and shortened the length of hospital stay (MD=−1.27 days; 95% CI [−2.10, −0.45];P= 0.002; I2= 67%). Trial sequential analysis excluded the presence of false positive results. Considering the influence of the route of interventions, we performed the subgroup analysis based on the nutritional route. Results indicated that omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients both in parenteral (RR = 0.39; 95% CI, [0.28, 0.56];P<0.00001; I2= 0%) or enteral routes (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, [0.30, 0.69];P= 0.0002; I2= 0%). In subgroup analysis of the period of interventions, pooled results showed that omega-3 FAs significantly reduced the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients compared to the control group with an intervention period of <7 days (RR = 0.40; 95% CI, [0.26, 0.60];P<0.00001; I2= 18%) or ≥ 7 days (RR = 0.43; 95% CI, [0.30, 0.61];P<0.00001; I2= 0%). In subgroup analysis with an intervention period of ≤ 10 days, omega-3 significantly reduced the incidence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients compared to the control group (RR = 0.41; 95% CI, [0.31, 0.53];P<0.00001; I2= 0%). But when patients received more than 10 days of interventions, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding infectious complications (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, [0.20, 3.17];P= 0.76; I2= 0%). This observation may be explained by the fact that if a patient still received nutritional support after 10 days of operation, it meant that patient have already developed complications and the his/her clinical conditions became more complex. In addition, prolonged interventional period was accompanied by longer durations of hospital stay, which may increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections. The findings provide new and robust evidence that supports the current guidelines on the recommendations of omega-3 fatty acids for surgical gastric cancer patients. These results also support the potential inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids as part of standard perioperative nutritional treatment, particularly for patients undergoing major cancer surgeries. Omega-3 supplementation should be initiated preoperatively or immediately postoperatively to maximize its anti-inflammatory and anti-infective effects. A supplementation period of 7–10 days is optimal. Both enteral and parenteral routes are effective, and the choice should be tailored to the patient’s clinical condition and tolerance.

There are several published systematic reviews and meta-analyses which evaluated the efficacy of immunonutrition on gastric cancer patients. Adiamah et al.’s study found that preoperative immune modulating nutrition containing omega-3 fatty acids, arginine, and nucleotides could significantly decrease infectious complications and presented a tendency to shorten length of hospital stay [53]. Similarly, in Song et al.’s study, they concluded that arginine, ribonucleic acids, and omega-3 fatty acids could reduce infectious complications and length of hospital stay [54]. But none of these studies reported the effects of immunonutrients on the immune function of patients. In meta-analyses of omega-3 FAs supplementation in postoperative gastrointestinal cancer on immune function, Bai et al.’s and Yu et al.’s studies both indicated that omega-3 FAs increased the level of CD4+and the CD4/CD8 ratio [55,56]. But their conclusions were compromised because of the small sample sizes. Our meta-analysis is the largest one up to date, and demonstrated the improvement in immune function of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with gastric cancer in addition to fighting against infections. Higher levels of CD4+T cell (MD = 4.96%; 95% CI, [3.49, 6.44];P<0.00001; I2= 84%) and CD4/CD8 (MD = 0.37; 95% CI, [0.18, 0.56];P= 0.0002; I2= 96%) in the omega-3 group may play an important role in the recovery of patients after surgery. However, the potential impact of these immune improvements on long-term outcomes, such as cancer recurrence rates or overall survival, remains unclear. Enhanced immune function may theoretically reduce cancer recurrence and improve survival by promoting antitumor immunity [57–60]. Emerging evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may modulate the gut microbiome, which plays a critical role in immune regulation and cancer recovery. Omega-3 FAs supplementation has been shown to promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and reduce inflammation, potentially enhancing immune function and postoperative recovery [61,62]. Future researches are needed to investigate the interaction between omega-3 fatty acids and the gut microbiome in gastric cancer patient. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids is generally safe, but their use in surgical patients should be approached with caution. Potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, coagulation status changing, or interactions with other medications, may occur, particularly in postoperative settings [63–65]. While our analysis did not identify significant adverse events, clinical practitioners should carefully monitor patients for these risks when administering omega-3 supplementation.

This systematic review and meta-analysis have some limitations. Firstly, no study reported long-term outcomes (e.g., the one year or longer survival rate of patients). And we cannot analyze the cost-effectiveness on omega-3 fatty acids intervention because of the lack of relevant data. For the same reasons, we were unable to explore the effects of surgical procedures, patient nutritional status and cancer stages on heterogeneity. In summary, more high-quality studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate our findings.

Omega-3 fatty acids intervention is associated with reduction of the occurrence of infectious complications in gastric cancer patients and may improve immune function.
