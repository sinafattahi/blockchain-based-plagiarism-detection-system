Silicon (Si4+) and selenium selenite (Se4+) exhibit antagonistic effects on cadmium (Cd2+). While plant electrophysiological sensors can quantify intracellular water and nutrient metabolism, the dynamic interactions between silicon and selenium in rice under cadmium stress remain unclear. This study focused on a rice variety (Yixiangyou 876, Enshi, Hubei Province, China), examining growth, photosynthesis, Se and Cd transport, and intracellular water and nutrient metabolism under varying silicon concentrations. Compared to Cd stress alone, the application of MSi (10 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+) increased rice growth, significantly increasing water transfer rate (WTR), nutrient active translocation capacity (NAC), and nutrient transfer rate (NTR) by 148.57%, 192.01%, and 148.57%, respectively. This synergistic treatment promoted Se translocation and decreased Cd concentration. In contrast, HSi (15 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+) suppressed rice growth, decreasing intracellular water holding capacity (IWHC) and NAC by 33.21% and 46.52%, respectively. Thus, 10 mM Si4+in combination with Se4+improved growth, photosynthesis, and intracellular water and nutrient transfer capacity in rice leaves and mitigated cadmium transport. This study provides scientific evidence for Enshi selenium-enriched cadmium-reduced rice. Its core value lies in converting complex physiological processes into quantifiable electrical signals, enabling researchers and farmers to precisely regulate the absorption and metabolism of selenium and cadmium in rice, ultimately achieving the agricultural goal of "high-quality, safe, and efficient" selenium-enriched agriculture.

Rice is a typical silica-loving plant, and both silicon and Se have been shown to counteract Cd transport in rice.7Specifically, silicon not only inhibits the transport of Cd to the shoots,8but also promotes iron translocation in the roots, thereby reducing the bioavailability of Cd in the soil.9,10Additionally, Se can compete with Cd for binding sites, reducing Cd translocation in plants.11While the beneficial roles of silicon and Se in Cd antagonism are evident, the interaction between silicon and Se in dynamic intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism under Cd stress in rice remains unclear.

Previous studies have utilized methods such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),12hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (HG-AFS),13and hyperspectral imaging (HSI)14to examine Cd2+translocation in plant species. However, the dynamic intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism in plants remains unexplored. Fortunately, plant electrophysiological techniques have emerged as innovative tools for investigating dynamic intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism in crops such as tomatoes,15potatoes,16and oilseed rape.17By employing plant electrical sensors, including intrinsic capacitance (ICP), intrinsic resistance (IR), intrinsic impedance (IZ), intrinsic capacitive reactance (IXC), and intrinsic inductive reactance (IXL),18it is possible to assess various aspects of intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism, such as intracellular water holding capacity (IWHC), intracellular water use efficiency (IWUE), intracellular water holding time (IWHT), and water transfer rate (WTR),19as well as nutrient translocation rate (NTR), nutrient translocation capacity (NTC), active transport flow of nutrients (UAF), and nutrient active translocation capacity (NAC).20,21These plant electrophysiological sensors provide a novel approach for understanding silicon‒Se interactions in dynamic intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism in rice under Cd stress.

This study focused on the rice variety Yixiangyou 876, a major rice cultivar from the Se-rich region of Enshi (Hubei Province, China). At varying silicon–Se levels, growth, photosynthesis, total Se and Cd transport, and intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism in rice leaves under Cd stress were investigated using electrophysiological sensors. This study aims to address the following questions: (1) to elucidate the interactions between silicon and Se on rice growth and Cd translocation, and (2) to clarify the intracellular water‒nutrient metabolism at different silicon‒Se levels in rice leaves under Cd stress, based on plant electrophysiological sensors.

After two weeks, the rice seedlings were transplanted, and Si4+, Se4+, and Cd2+were added using SiO2, CdCl2, and Na2SeO3. Six experimental groups were established (n= 3 pots/group, as outlined inTable 1). The Ck group treated rice seedlings without selenium, cadmium, and silicon, rice seedlings were treated with 6 μM Cd2+in the Cd group, rice seedlings were treated with 8 μM Se4+and 6 μM Cd2+in the Sc group, rice seedlings were treated with 3 mM Si4+, 8 μM Se4+, and 6 μM Cd2+in the LSi group, rice seedlings were treated with 10 mM Si4+, 8 μM Se4+, and 6 μM Cd2+in the MSi group, rice seedlings were treated with 15 mM Si4+, 8 μM Se4+, and 6 μM Cd2+in the HSi group and the rice was harvested after 21 d.

Use scissors to cut the roots, stems, and leaves of the rice, wash them, and measure the growth parameters of the rice using an analytical balance (0.0001 g, AR124CN, Shanghai, China) (Including root biomass, stem biomass, and leaf biomass).

After digesting the roots, stems, and leaves of the rice samples, total Se and Cd contents were determined using the ICP-MS method.25,26Additionally, the total Se and Cd transport coefficients, along with the concentration coefficient, were calculated usingEquations 2and3.

Three weeks after rice treatment, rice plants exhibiting consistent growth and overall health under various treatments were selected for testing. The third fully expanded leaves of these plants were placed between parallel plates, with the measurement voltage set to 1.5 volts and the frequency adjusted to 3000 Hz to ensure accurate readings. The parallel capacitance sensors were configured in parallel mode for assessment using an LCR tester (LCR-6100, China,Figure 1).27Under different clamping forces (F), the resistance (R), impedance (Z), and capacitance (CP) of the leaves were measured. For each clamping force, data were collected across 15–20 sets to maintain consistency. Ultimately, fifteen data sets were selected for further calculations to ensure reliable and statistically significant results in evaluating the electrical properties of the leaf tissues under the experimental conditions.

InEquation 4,y0=2∆HU2,a=2VSU2can be adjusted to reflect the variation in C of the plant leaves with respect to F, as described byEquation 2.

Based on the values of R, Z, and Xc, the XLof the plant leaves was analyzed usingEquation 7.

Using the Gibbs free energy equation and the Nernst equation, the models relating R (Z/Xc/XL) to F were derived as shown inEquations 8–11.

When no clamping force (F = 0 N) is applied, the IR, IZ, IXC, and IXLof the plant leaves can be calculated fromEquations 12–15.

The ICP of the plant leaves can be calculated usingEquation 16.

In this experiment, plant electronic technology methods were employed to assess intracellular water and nitrogen metabolism in rice leaves, with equations referenced from previous studies.27,28The IWHC of the plant leaves was calculated usingEquation 17.

The specific effective thickness (d) of the plant leaves was calculated usingEquation 18.

The IWUE of the plant leaves was calculated usingEquation 19.

The IWHT of the plant leaves was calculated usingEquation 20.

The WTR of the plant leaves was calculated usingEquation 21.

The nutrient flux per unit area (UNF) of the plant leaves was calculated usingEquation 22.

Since nutrients are soluble in water, WTR and NTR are conceptually similar. Both rates are interconnected, as nutrient movement relies on water as the transport medium. Consequently, they are often assigned the same value, which is calculated usingEquation 23. Furthermore, NTC represents the total efficiency of nutrient movement within the plant system under specific conditions. It is calculated as the product of UNF and NTR, as detailed inEquation 24.

The UAF can be calculated usingEquation 25. Therefore, NAC is the product of UAF and NTR, as indicated inEquation 26.

The experimental data were evaluated for statistical differences using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey's test (p≤ 0.05) was performed for pairwise comparisons between the different experimental treatments. The results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the figures were designed using Origin 2024 (64-bit).

Using the intrinsic electrical sensors of rice leaves (Figure 4), the intracellular water (Figure 5) and nutrient (Figure 6) metabolism of rice leaves were quantified. As presented inFigure 5, compared to Ck, MSi exhibited the highest levels of IWHC (Figure 5a), IWUE (Figure 5b), and WTR (Figure 5d), with increases of 49.13%, 58.35%, and 148.60%, respectively.

As presented inFigure 6, compared to Ck, Cd had the highest UNF (Figure 6a), with an increase of 106.36%, while MSi exhibited the lowest UNF, with a decrease of 33.85%.

In this study, compared to Cd, silicon-Se treatments promoted the total Se content (Table 4), TF Se, and BCF Se in rice plants (Table 6), while reducing the total Cd content (Table 5), TF Cd, and BCF Cd. The TF Cd of MSi was the lowest, indicating that 10 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+jointly inhibited Cd stress in rice plants. On one hand, Se promotes the formation of SeCd complexes, which inhibits Cd translocation from roots to shoots.31On the other hand, silicon may enhance the formation of selenomethionine (SeMet), which decreases Cd translocation in plant leaves.38Typically, while TF Se and BCF Se were highest at HSi (15 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+), this treatment also exhibited high levels of TF Cd and BCF Cd. This result may be due to the formation of CdCO3–Si(CO3)2rather than CdSe under excess silicon supply,31leading to increased Cd translocation in rice leaves. Therefore, 10 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+effectively decreased Cd translocation in rice leaves in this experiment.

In this study, the highest IWHC, IWUE, and WTR were observed at MSi (8 μM Se4+and 10 mM Si4+), while the lowest IWHT (Figure 5) was attributed to decreased Cd accumulation and increased rice plant growth. Increased biomass and photosynthesis were associated with enhanced intracellular water metabolism in plants.44However, at HSi (8 μM Se4+and 15 mM Si4+), leaf intracellular water metabolism was decreased, exhibiting the lowest IWHC, IWUE, and WTR due to inhibited rice growth and a decrease in Pn.45Additionally, the IWHT at HSi significantly increased, indicating that mesophyll cells alleviated internal water shortage by extending water retention in rice leaves.27Additionally, the intracellular nutrient metabolism in rice leaves was assessed using plant electrophysiological sensors. UNF represented the passive transport uptake capacity, while UAF, NTR, NTC, and NAC represented the active transport uptake capacity.46,47The highest NTR, NTC, UAF, and NAC, along with the lowest UNF, were found at MSi (Figure 6). This was attributed to the significant promotion of growth and water utilization in rice leaves by MSi, suggesting that 10 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+facilitated the formation of binding proteins to increase the PC‒Cd complex and decrease the bioavailability of Cd. At high silicon levels, where vacuole volume is decreased, passive transport becomes the primary mode of nutrient translocation, which helps mitigate growth inhibition in plants.48Thus, at HSi, the highest UNF and the lowest NTR and NAC were observed, indicating that 15 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+inhibited intracellular nutrient metabolism in rice leaves (Figure 7).

This study, utilizing electrophysiological sensors, investigates the interaction between silicon and Se in dynamic intracellular water-nutrient metabolism in rice leaves under Cd stress. MSi promoted rice growth, whereas HSi inhibited it. MSi exhibited higher WTR, NAC, and NTR, enhancing Se translocation and SeCd formation, which in turn decreased Cd accumulation in rice leaves. In contrast, HSi suppressed growth and photosynthesis, likely due to decreased IWHC, NAC, and Se translocation, while potentially promoting the formation of CdCO3–Si(CO3)2in rice leaves. Therefore, 10 mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+increased intracellular water and nutrient metabolism in rice leaves to mitigate Cd stress, while 15  mM Si4+and 8 μM Se4+decreased rice growth by inhibiting leaf water and nutrient metabolism under Cd stress.
