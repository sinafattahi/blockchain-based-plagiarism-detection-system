Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with the translocation of chromosome (6;9)(p23;q34) forms the DEK-NUP214 fusion mRNA, which is a rare subtype (~1%). Owing to the paucity of this AML subtype, comprehensive studies analysing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) outcomes are lacking.

We aimed to evaluate the dynamic evolution ofDEK-NUP214transcripts before and after allo-HSCT as well as the impact of pretransplantDEK-NUP214status on posttransplant outcomes in AML patients in a retrospective, multicentre study (n= 14).

Intermediate- or high-risk AML patients withoutDEK-NUP214transcripts receiving allo-HSCT during the same time period were enrolled as controls. Ten (71.4%) patients showedDEK-NUP214positivity before allo-HSCT. Except for one patient who died early after allo-HSCT, 7 out of the other 9 patients (77.8%) achievedDEK-NUP214negativity after allo-HSCT. The 2-year probabilities of relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukaemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS) were 14.3% (95% CI, 0%–33.6%), 35.7% (95% CI, 9.3%–62.1%), 50.0% (95% CI, 29.6%–84.4%), and 50.0% (95% CI, 29.6%–84.4%), respectively. The incidence of relapse was comparable between AML patients with and withoutDEK-NUP214transcript, but the incidence of NRM, LFS, and OS of patients withDEK-NUP214was poorer compared with those withoutDEK-NUP214transcript.

Thus, this study observed that allo-HSCT could overcome the poor prognosis of persistentDEK-NUP214positivity after chemotherapy; however, new therapies should be further identified to improve the outcomes of AML patients withDEK-NUP214.

Owing to the paucity of this AML subtype, comprehensive studies analysing allo-HSCT outcomes are lacking.[8,9]In 2012, Ishiyamaet al.[9]conducted a matched-pair analysis ofde novoAML patients with and without t(6;9)(p23;q34), using data obtained from the Japanese HSCT data registry. The outcomes were comparable between the two groups, suggesting that allo-HSCT may overcome the unfavorable impact of t(6:9)(p23;q34). In a recent study, Diaz-Beyaet al.[10]reported the largest cohort of 195 patients with t(6;9)(p23;q34) receiving allo-HSCT. For patients transplanted in CR1, the 2-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and OS were 57% and 61%, respectively, which were equivalent to the outcomes of other intermediate-risk AML patients.[11]However, these studies did not identify the dynamic evolution of measurable residual disease (MRD,i.e.,DEK-NUP214transcript) before and after allo-HSCT, or the impact of pretransplant MRD status on posttransplant outcomes.[12]In particular, whetherDEK-NUP214transcript positivity before allo-HSCT influences posttransplant clinical outcomes remain unclear.

Thus, this retrospective, multicentre study aimed to evaluate the dynamic evolution ofDEK-NUP214transcripts before and after allo-HSCT as well as the impact of pretransplantDEK-NUP214status on posttransplant outcomes in AML patients.

This is a multicenter, retrospective study. Consecutive patients with AML andDEK-NUP214fusion receiving allo-HSCT at Institute of Haematology (i.e., TROPHY group) between March 2016 and April 2021 were enrolled. Intermediate- or high-risk AML patients withoutDEK-NUP214fusion receiving allo-HSCT during the same time period were enrolled as controls and propensity-matched (1∶3) to those withDEK-NUP214fusion using the nearest-neighbour method and a 2% calliper. Age, sex, donor type, and disease status were matched by propensity scores. The last follow-up was on May 1, 2023. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating hospital and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The requirement for written informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective nature of the study and lack of intervention in these patients.

Relapse was defined as recurrence of > 5% bone marrow (BM) blasts, reappearance of blasts in peripheral blood, development of extramedullary disease, or recurrence of pretransplantation chromosomal abnormalities. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was defined as death without disease progression or relapse. LFS was defined as survival with continuous CR. OS events were defined as death from any cause.

Frequencies and percentages were used to describe patient characteristics. The Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to calculate the probabilities of survival, and a cumulative incidence function was adopted to calculate the incidence of engraftment, GVHD, relapse, and NRM using a competing risk analysis.[25]Two-sidedPvalues were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R software 4.2.0 (https://www.r-project.org) and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 26.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study (Table 1andTable 2). The distribution of other molecular abnormalities is shown inFigure 1Aand1B. The median follow-up duration was 716 days (range, 7–2562 days). The clinical outcomes of the patients were as follows.

Allo-HSCT: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; MRD: measurable residual disease; MFC: multicolor flow cytometry; N/A: not applicable.

Thirteen (92.8%) patients achieved neutrophil engraftment, and the median time from transplantation to neutrophil engraftment was 12 days (range, 11–20) days. Thirteen (92.8%) patients achieved platelet engraftment, and the median time from transplantation to platelet engraftment was 14 days (range, 9–83 days). The 60-day cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment after allo-HSCT was 92.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.6%–100%).

Ten (71.4%) patients experienced acute graft versus host disease GVHD (aGVHD) after allo-HSCT, and 5 (50.0%), 4 (40.0%), 0, and 1 (10.0%) patients experienced grade I, II, III, and IV aGVHD, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grade I–IV and grade II–IV aGVHD 100 days after allo-HSCT were 71.4% (95% CI, 45.5%–97.3%) and 35.7% (95% CI, 9.3%–62.1%), respectively.

Six (42.9%) patients developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) after allo-HSCT, and 0 and 4 (28.6%) patients experienced moderate and severe cGVHD, respectively. The cumulative incidences of cGVHD and severe cGVHD at 2 years after allo-HSCT were 35.7% (95% CI, 8.7%–62.7%) and 21.4% (95% CI, 0%–44.3%), respectively.

Three (21.4%) patients received maintenance therapy after allo-HSCT (Table 2). Two (14.3%) patients withFLT3mutations receivedFLT3inhibitors as maintenance therapy, and one (7.1%) patient received hypomethylation agents as maintenance therapy.

Ten (71.4%) patients showedDEK-NUP214positivity before allo-HSCT, with a median transcript level of 4.17% (range 0.03%–143.80%). Except for one patient who died early after allo-HSCT, seven of the other nine patients (77.8%) achieved negativity after allo-HSCT, and four (57.1%), two (28.6%), and one (14.3%) achieved MRD negativity at 1, 2, and 3 months after allo-HSCT, respectively.

Two patients exhibited persistent MRD positivity after allo-HSCT. In addition, 1 patient showed MRD positivity again after MRD negativity. Thus, 3 patients showed MRD positivity after allo-HSCT. One of them received both DLI and IFN-α treatment as preemptive intervention but failed. The other two patients died of infection and did not receive preemptive therapies. One patient experienced hematologic relapse without MRD positivity.

Eight (80.0%) patients showed both MFC positivity andDEK-NUP214positivity before allo-HSCT, with a median level of MFC-MRD of 0.55% (range 0.03%–4.50%). All patients achieved MFC negativity, and seven (87.5%) and one (22.5%) achieved MFC negativity at 1 and 2 months after allo-HSCT, respectively.

Two patients experienced relapse at 157 and 273 days after allo-HSCT and died 336 and 410 days after relapse, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse 2 years after allo-HSCT was 14.3% (95% CI, 0%–33.6%) (Figure 2A). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse after allo-HSCT was 10.0% (95% CI, 0%–30.1%) and 25.0% (95% CI, 0%–74.0%) for patients withDEK-NUP214positivity and negativity, respectively, before allo-HSCT (P= 0.528).

Five patients died of NRM. The most common cause of NRM was infection (n= 3), followed by cerebral hemorrhage (n= 1) and heart failure (n= 1). The cumulative incidence of NRM 2 years after allo-HSCT was 35.7% (95% CI, 9.3%–62.1%) (Figure 2B). The 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM after allo-HSCT was 50.0% (95% CI, 16.3%–83.7%) and 0% for patients withDEK-NUP214positivity and negativity before allo-HSCT, respectively (P= 0.100).

The probability of LFS 2 years after allo-HSCT was 50.0% (95% CI, 29.6%–84.4%) (Figure 2C). The 2-year probabilities of LFS after allo-HSCT were 40.0% (95% CI, 18.7%–85.5%) and 75.0% (95% CI, 42.6%–100.0%) for patients withDEK-NUP214positivity and negativity, respectively, before allo-HSCT (P= 0.230).

The probability of OS 2 years after allo-HSCT was 50.0% (95% CI, 29.6%–84.4%) (Figure 2D). The 2-year probabilities of OS after allo-HSCT were 40.0% (95% CI, 18.7%–85.5%) and 75.0% (95% CI, 42.6%–100.0%) for patients withDEK-NUP214positivity and negativity, respectively, before allo-HSCT (P= 0.200).

The characteristics of patients withthe DEK-NUP214transcript and intermediate-or high-risk AML patients withoutthe DEK-NUP214transcript are shown inTable 3. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse after allo-HSCT was comparable between the two cohorts (Figure 3A). However, the 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM after allo-HSCT in patients withDEK-NUP214transcripts was higher than that in patients withoutDEK-NUP214transcripts (Figure 3B). The 2-year probabilities of OS and LFS after allo-HSCT in patients withDEK-NUP214transcripts were poorer than those in patients withoutDEK-NUP214transcripts (Figure 3Cand3D).

Owing to the rarity of AML in patients withDEK-NUP214, multicenter cooperative efforts are required to analyze the specific outcomes and the results of allo-HSCT. In the present study, we observed that the 2-year probabilities of relapse, NRM, LFS, and OS after allo-HSCT were 14.3%, 35.7%, 50.0%, and 50.0%, respectively, in AML patients withDEK-NUP214transcripts. In particular, we observed that more than 75% of patients achieved MRD negativity after allo-HSCT and that pretransplantDEK-NUP214positivity did not influence posttransplant outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first and largest study focusing on the dynamic evolution ofDEK-NUP214positivity before and after allo-HSCT in patients with AML andDEK-NUP214fusion.

Garconet al.[5]reported that patients with AML with t(6;9) (p23;q34) who achieved consistent molecular remission, as assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), showed better survival than patients with persistentDEK-NUP214positivity, implying a pivotal role for MRD monitoring in this AML subtype. In particular, they observed that all patients with persistentDEK-NUP214positivity after chemotherapy died of refractory disease, except for one patient who died of toxicity.[5]In contrast, in the present study, we observed that most patients achieved MRD negativity after allo-HSCT, suggesting that allo-HSCT could overcome the poor prognosis of persistentDEK-NUP214positivity after chemotherapy. This may be attributed to the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.[26]In addition, several studies have reported that allo-HSCT, particularly HID HSCT, could overcome the negative impact of pretransplant MRD positivity on posttransplant outcomes.[27,28,29,30]In the present study, nearly 85% of the patients underwent HID HSCT, which may have also contributed to the high conversion of MRD positivity to negativity.

We observed that the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse after allo-HSCT was only 14.3% in AML patients withDEK-NUP214, which was comparable to that in intermediate- or high-risk AML patients withoutDEK-NUP214. Previous studies showed that the relapse rate of AML patients withDEK-NUP214was > 80% and the 5-year survival rate was only 9% for those who did not receive allo-HSCT.[2,31]Wanget al.[32]reported that the incidence of relapse was approximately 16% in adult patients with AML receiving allo-HSCT at CR1. Thus, allo-HSCT can overcome the effect ofDEK-NUP214on relapse in patients with AML. However, the 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM inthe DEK-NUP214group was 35.7%, which was higher than that in the group withoutDEK-NUP214. In previous studies, the cumulative incidence of NRM in HID HSCT was 11.6%–34.0%.[28,33,34,35]Considering that most patients received HID HSCT in the present study and the bias in the small sample size, our NRM incidence was not significantly higher than that in those who enrolled HID HSCT recipients. On the other hand, we found that the DEK-NUP214 group had a higher ELN risk (P= 0.001). Therefore, we believe it is possible that the high NRM incidence is associated with a high ELN risk baseline in the DEK-NUP214 group.

The maintenance of sorafenib therapy after allo-HSCT could further decrease the incidence of relapse and improve LFS[40,41]of AML patients with FLT3 mutation; however, Xuanet al.[40]reported that male patients who were MRD positivity before or after allo-HSCT could benefit from sorafenib maintenance therapy. Similarly, in MORPHO study,[42]the researchers also observed that the benefits of gilteritinib maintenance was restricted in patients with MRD positivity before allo-HSCT. Thus, the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitor maintenance for patients who were MRD negativity before allo-HSCT should be further identified. Lastly, patients received MRD monitoring regularly after allo-HSCT. Thus, patients who had positive MRD received preemptive therapy in the present study, which might help to prevent relapse in those without maintenance therapies.

This study had some limitations. Firstly, it was a retrospective study. In addition, due to the small sample size, some trends did not reach statistical significance. Further prospective studies or larger multicentre retrospective studies are needed to confirm and supplement our present study findings.

In summary, our study demonstrated that allo-HSCT can overcome the poor prognosis associated with persistentDEK-NUP214positivity after chemotherapy in patients with AML. However, the posttransplant outcomes of AML patients withDEK-NUP214transcripts were poorer than those of patients withoutDEK-NUP214transcript. Future studies should identify better therapeutic strategies to improve the clinical outcomes ofDEK-NUP214subtype in AML.
