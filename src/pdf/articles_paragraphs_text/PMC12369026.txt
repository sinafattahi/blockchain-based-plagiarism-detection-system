This prospective clinical trial aimed to compare the effects of single-layer versus double-layer uterine closure techniques on cesarean scar healing in women undergoing repeat cesarean delivery.

Seventy women aged 18–50 years with a history of at least one prior cesarean delivery were randomized into two groups: single-layer non-locking closure (n= 35) and double-layer non-locking closure with surgical refreshing of the incision edges (n= 35). The primary outcome was residual myometrial thickness (RMT) measured by transvaginal ultrasonography at six months. Secondary outcomes included RMT at six weeks, healing ratios, presence of niche, operative time, transfusion need, infectious morbidity, and hospital stay duration. Sample size was based on preliminary data indicating a mean RMT of 5 mm (SD 0.6 mm). To detect a 0.5 mm difference with α = 0.05 and β = 0.8, 26 participants per group were required; 35 were enrolled per group.

At six months, the double-layer group had significantly greater RMT (5.1 ± 0.4 mm vs. 4.1 ± 0.4 mm;p< 0.001). Similar findings were seen at six weeks. Operative time was shorter in the single-layer group. However, this group required more frequent additional uterine suturing due to suboptimal tissue approximation or bleeding, which did not significantly extend operative duration. Hemoglobin levels and hospital stay were comparable. Transfusion was needed in one patient in the single-layer group and three in the double-layer group.

Double-layer closure with surgical edge refreshing was associated with improved cesarean scar healing based on RMT.

Cesarean section (CS) is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures worldwide, with its rates increasing steadily—especially in high-income countries [1]. In Turkey, more than half of all births occur via CS. Although often life-saving, cesarean delivery carries both short- and long-term maternal risks. Early complications include infection, hemorrhage, and thromboembolism, while inadequate uterine healing can lead to future complications such as uterine rupture and placenta accreta spectrum disorders [2,3]. Additionally, cesarean scar pregnancy and niche formation may result in postmenstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and dysmenorrhea [4].

The global overuse of CS is another growing concern. Non-medical factors—such as maternal request and medicolegal pressures—have driven rates well above the WHO’s recommended threshold, with projections nearing 29% globally by 2030 [5]. This trend contributes to avoidable risks and economic burden.

Advanced maternal age has been consistently associated with a higher risk of cesarean delivery, particularly when compounded by ART conception or coexisting maternal conditions, underscoring the importance of optimizing surgical techniques in this population [6].

Despite the rising frequency of CS, no consensus exists on the optimal uterine closure method. Techniques vary in the number of layers, locking style, and inclusion of the endometrium [7]. Their comparative effectiveness in reducing scar defects remains unclear [8,9]. Meta-analyses have yielded conflicting results: some report increased uterine rupture risk with single-layer locking sutures and better healing with double-layer closure, while others find no significant difference in scar outcomes [10,11].

Other factors such as maternal age, obesity, and repeated CS also influence isthmocele risk, which may exceed 65% in symptomatic cases. Emerging techniques, like the purse-string closure, offer promise but require further validation due to heterogeneity in existing evidence [12,13]. The role of endometrial inclusion is also debated; one trial found no difference in residual myometrial thickness (RMT) or symptoms between closure and non-closure at six months [14]. A recent review reported niche prevalence up to 84% and highlighted its impact on fertility and quality of life, stressing the need for standardized assessment tools [15].

This study aims to evaluate the impact of two different uterine closure techniques—single-layer versus double-layer non-locking sutures—on cesarean scar healing, as measured by RMT. By assessing healing at both six weeks and six months postpartum, this study seeks to contribute clinically applicable, time-specific data to an area of ongoing debate. Unlike previous studies, both techniques exclude endometrial inclusion, and surgical debridement is added in the double-layer group. Blinded ultrasonographic evaluation at defined time points strengthens objectivity. These methodological strengths help clarify the comparative efficacy of standardized closure techniques and add robust, evidence-based guidance to current surgical practice.

This prospective, randomized clinical trial was carried out at the Research Hospital of Atatürk University Faculty of Medicine between April 2018 and April 2019. The study received ethical approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Atatürk University Faculty of Medicine (Approval No: B.30.2.ATA.0.01.00/150; Date: March 29, 2018). Prior to participation, all individuals provided written informed consent. This study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Women aged 18–50 years with at least one previous cesarean delivery were considered eligible to maintain consistency in uterine healing characteristics and to reduce variability related to primary uterine incision. Exclusion criteria included suspected or confirmed placenta previa or placenta accreta spectrum, clinical chorioamnionitis, anterior wall uterine fibroids, a history of non–low transverse uterine incision, and cases with anticipated obstetric hemorrhage.

Eligibility was assessed through clinical history, physical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and laboratory investigations (including complete blood count, biochemical profile, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and blood type). Randomization was performed using computer-generated allocation lists created by a third-party physician who was not involved in the study. Group assignments were sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, which were opened intraoperatively by the principal investigator.

All cesarean deliveries were performed by senior residents under either general or regional anesthesia, selected based on patient preference and anesthesiologist consultation. Preoperative preparations included pubic hair removal, Foley catheterization, and antisepsis with povidone-iodine. A Pfannenstiel skin incision and a low transverse uterine incision were utilized in all cases. After fetal and placental delivery, cord blood gas analysis was performed. The uterus was either exteriorized or repaired in situ, depending on intraoperative assessment.

In the single-layer group, the uterine incision was closed with a continuous, non-locking, single-layer suture without refreshing the edges or including the endometrium. In the double-layer group, surgical debridement of the incision margins was performed prior to closure; the initial layer was sutured continuously in a non-locking, subcuticular-like manner without involving the endometrium, followed by a second continuous non-locking suture applied to the remaining myometrial tissue. In both groups, 1 − 0 polyglactin (Vicryl®) sutures were used.

Additional uterine sutures were placed as needed using 1 − 0 or 2 − 0 Vicryl. The peritoneum was optionally closed with 2 − 0 Vicryl. Fascia closure was performed using 1 − 0 Vicryl, and subcutaneous tissue was sutured when necessary. Skin closure was achieved with a subcuticular 2 − 0 Vicryl suture. Operative time (skin-to-skin) was recorded. Postoperative hemograms were evaluated at 48 h. Patients with stable laboratory values were discharged. Erythrocyte transfusion or intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) was administered based on clinical indications.

Postoperative follow-up was scheduled at six weeks and six months postpartum. At both time points, residual myometrial thickness (RMT) and niche formation were evaluated using transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUSG)(Fig.1).All examinations were conducted in the lithotomy position with an empty bladder, using a high-frequency (7.5–9 MHz) transvaginal probe. Measurements were obtained in the sagittal plane at the cesarean scar site, and RMT was defined as the shortest distance between the endometrial–myometrial junction and the serosal surface. All ultrasonographic assessments were performed by the same experienced examiner, who was blinded to group allocation.

The primary outcome was RMT at 6 months postoperatively, measured via TVUS in millimeters, with each measurement repeated at least three times. Secondary outcomes included RMT at 6 weeks; healing ratio at both follow-ups (calculated as RMT × 100/total myometrial thickness); presence of scar defect, defined as a hypoechoic area ≥ 1 mm in depth on TVUS; total operative time; change in hemoglobin levels (preoperative vs. 48 h postoperative); number of blood transfusion units within 7 days; maternal infectious morbidity within 6 weeks (including endometritis, fever, and wound complications); hospitalization duration within 30 days; and additional intraoperative parameters (e.g., subcutaneous closure, peritoneal closure, uterine exteriorization, and need for supplementary uterine sutures).

The healing ratio was calculated as (RMT × 100/total wall thickness) to reflect the proportional restoration of the myometrial layer in relation to the full thickness of the uterine scar. This normalized index has been used in prior literature to evaluate the quality of scar healing across patients with variable uterine dimensions.

The sample size was calculated to detect a 0.5 mm difference in RMT at 6 months. Preliminary data from a retrospective review of 60 patients who underwent repeat cesarean deliveries at our institution showed a mean RMT of 5 mm (SD: 0.6 mm). Based on α = 0.05 and β = 0.8, a minimum of 26 patients per group was required. To account for potential attrition and non-normal data distribution, 35 participants were enrolled per group, for a total of 70 patients.

All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The normality of data distribution was evaluated using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Depending on the distribution, continuous variables were analyzed using either the Student’s t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were assessed through Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, as deemed appropriate. A p-value less than 0.05 was regarded as indicative of statistical significance. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

During the study period, 90 patients were invited to participate. Of these, 70 met the inclusion criteria and consented to take part in the study. Participants were randomized equally into two groups: 35 patients were allocated to the single-layer group and 35 to the double-layer group. Surgical interventions were conducted as per protocol. Ultimately, 26 patients in the single-layer group and 28 patients in the double-layer group completed the study and were included in the final analysis (Fig.2).

Demographic and obstetric characteristics of both groups are summarized in Table1. Variables such as age, gravida, parity, number of living children, number of abortions, gestational age at delivery, and the number of previous cesarean sections were comparable between the two groups. Most participants had undergone one prior cesarean delivery (range: 1–2). Complications in previous pregnancies and current pregnancy-related conditions were similarly distributed across the groups.

At 6 months postpartum, niche formation was detected in all participants in both groups (100% prevalence), based on the predefined ultrasonographic criteria.

At six weeks postpartum, the double-layer group demonstrated greater values in residual myometrial thickness (RMT), niche depth, and total uterine wall thickness (Table2). Although these measurements decreased over time in both groups, they remained higher in the double-layer group at the six-month follow-up.

The niche-to-total wall thickness ratio at six weeks was comparable between the groups. This ratio increased over time in both groups, and by six months, remained similar between cohorts (Table2).

The healing ratio at six months postpartum, calculated as (RMT × 100/total wall thickness), was significantly higher in the double-layer group (Table2).

The mean duration of surgery was significantly longer in the double-layer group (36 ± 6 min) compared to the single-layer group (31 ± 4 min). Other intraoperative and perioperative parameters—such as type of anesthesia, uterine exteriorization, peritoneal closure, subcutaneous closure, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, length of hospital stay, neonatal birth weight, sex, and APGAR scores—did not differ significantly between the groups.

Additional uterine suturing was required more frequently in the single-layer group (10/26; 39%) compared to the double-layer group (3/28; 11%) (p= 0.017). Blood transfusion (erythrocyte suspension) was administered to one patient in the single-layer group (4%) and three patients in the double-layer group (11%) (p= 0.612). Ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject) was given to one patient in the single-layer group (4%) and four patients in the double-layer group (14%) (p= 0.353).

No major complications were observed in either group. One patient in the single-layer group developed postoperative fever, while two patients in the double-layer group experienced wound dehiscence(Table3).

This prospective randomized trial demonstrated that double-layer non-locking uterine closure with surgical edge refreshing resulted in significantly greater residual myometrial thickness (RMT), niche depth, and total uterine wall thickness at both six weeks and six months postpartum, compared to single-layer closure. Although the double-layer technique was associated with longer operative time, no major differences were observed in clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin drop, transfusion need, or infectious complications. Importantly, niche formation occurred in all patients, regardless of closure technique.

Our findings demonstrated that residual myometrial thickness, as well as niche depth and total uterine wall thickness, were significantly greater in the double-layer group at both 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Although both RMT and niche depth were greater in the double-layer group, this may not indicate a contradiction. Rather, it reflects an overall increase in total wall thickness and improved tissue remodeling. The healing ratio and niche-to-wall thickness ratio were comparable between groups, suggesting that a deeper niche in this context coexisted with thicker residual myometrium due to more robust closure and tissue approximation.

These results are consistent with previous clinical studies suggesting that non-locking double-layer closure yields superior RMT and may therefore be preferable [10]. Roberge et al. assessed three techniques and reported that double-layer, non-locking closure excluding the endometrium resulted in the greatest RMT [7]. Similarly, Sevket et al. found significantly thicker residual myometrial tissue in patients who underwent double-layer closure assessed by hydrosonography six months after cesarean Sect. [16].

Di Spiezio Sardo et al. concluded in a meta-analysis that single-layer closure was associated with significantly thinner RMT, although uterine rupture rates did not differ significantly between the two techniques. This partially aligns with our findings regarding RMT. However, the meta-analyses by Di Spiezio Sardo et al. and Stegwee et al. did not specifically assess operative time as an outcome. Therefore, comparisons regarding surgical duration should be interpreted with caution [2,11].

Kalem et al. reported that double-layer closure may help prevent isthmocele formation by preserving greater residual tissue thickness [17]. In contrast, Yılmaz Baran et al., similar to our study, found no significant difference in niche formation rates between single- and double-layer closures [18]. Notably, a systematic review by Bij de Vaate et al. found larger niche sizes in patients who underwent single-layer closure, a finding that contrasts with our results [1].

However, a recent prospective randomized study using standardized transvaginal ultrasonography reported no significant differences in residual myometrial thickness or scar dimensions between single- and double-layer closure techniques, highlighting the variability in findings across studies. Although double-layer closure was associated with a modestly longer operative time and a slightly reduced postoperative hemoglobin drop, the overall clinical impact of these differences was minimal. Our findings underscore the utility of ultrasonography as a standardized and noninvasive tool for cesarean scar evaluation. However, they also suggest that small differences in anatomical parameters such as RMT or niche depth may not, in isolation, provide sufficient insight into clinical prognosis [19].

This distinction becomes even more apparent when considering symptomatic outcomes. In the 2Close multicenter randomized controlled trial involving over 2,200 patients, double-layer closure was not associated with reduced postmenstrual spotting compared to single-layer closure. Despite minor differences in niche prevalence, clinical symptoms remained largely unaffected. A parallel cost-effectiveness analysis also concluded that the added operative time and resource use of double-layer closure did not yield sufficient clinical or economic benefit to justify universal adoption [20,21].

Moreover, technical aspects such as whether the endometrium is included or excluded during closure may be equally or more important than the number of layers. Recent sonohysterographic data demonstrated that excluding the endometrium from uterine closure significantly reduced the risk of clinically meaningful niche formation. This finding supports the surgical technique employed in our study and may partially explain the overall favorable outcomes seen with our double-layer approach [22].

An important methodological observation in our study was the relatively low standard deviation in ultrasonographic measurements across participants. This may be partially due to the homogeneity of our cohort, composed exclusively of women with a prior cesarean section. It is conceivable that once a uterine scar has formed, subsequent healing responses become less variable, regardless of the closure technique used.

A limitation of the study is the lack of baseline assessment of uterine scar morphology prior to the index pregnancy. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility that some niches observed postpartum may have pre-existed following prior cesarean delivery.

A disadvantage of this study is the employment of conventional transvaginal ultrasonography instead of contrast-enhanced methods like saline or gel instillation sonography, which recent expert opinion deems more sensitive for niche detection. Our objective was to represent conventional procedure, with all measures standardized and conducted by a single blinded operator.

Strengths of this study include the homogeneity of the patient population based on strict inclusion criteria and the consistency in timing and method of ultrasonographic evaluation, which likely enhanced the reliability of scar assessment. Importantly, no major surgical complications occurred in either group.

Both closure techniques employed in this study excluded the endometrium. However, current evidence remains inconclusive regarding the long-term benefits or risks of endometrial inclusion during uterine closure.

It is also critical to recognize that RMT may function more as a surrogate marker than a definitive endpoint for uterine healing. To comprehensively evaluate closure efficacy, future research should focus on long-term outcomes such as uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies, incidence of isthmocele-related gynecologic symptoms, and occurrence of placenta accreta spectrum disorders. Such investigations would require larger patient cohorts and substantial institutional resources, which were beyond the scope of the present study.

However, evidence is emerging that RMT and niche formation may influence not only gynecologic symptoms but also long-term fertility outcomes. According to the 2Close trial protocol, niche-related alterations in endometrial receptivity or intracavitary fluid dynamics could impair implantation or contribute to unexplained subfertility. While our study did not examine fertility parameters directly, the potential reproductive implications of uterine scar quality underscore the broader significance of closure technique decisions [23].

While this study focused on uterine closure in repeat cesarean deliveries, our findings also underscore the broader importance of evidence-based surgical techniques in reducing long-term morbidity. Promoting optimal closure strategies may indirectly support efforts to reduce overall cesarean rates by minimizing complications that lead to repeat CS. Moreover, prevention of primary cesarean delivery remains critical in addressing the global overuse of the procedure.

In conclusion, double-layer non-locking uterine closure with surgical refreshing of the scar edges appears to improve cesarean scar healing, as evidenced by increased residual myometrial thickness, when compared to single-layer non-locking closure.
