With global super-aging, understanding the longitudinal changes in activities of daily living (ADLs) among older adults is critical for maintaining their functional independence, particularly in later life. However, evidence of longitudinal ADL patterns in Asian octogenarians remains limited. This study examined 6-year ADL transition patterns among community-dwelling older adults in Japan aged 85 years or above using latent transition analysis (LTA) to identify dynamic changes and associated factors.

The present study used data from the Tokyo Oldest Old Survey on Total Health study, a prospective cohort of 538 participants aged 85 years or older. ADL was assessed using the Barthel index at baseline, 3 years, and 6 years. Through LTA, latent clusters at each time point were identified, and transition probabilities across clusters were estimated. Cluster characteristics and transitions were examined relative to demographic, physical, cognitive, lifestyle, and biological factors. Random forest analysis was used to identify predictors of longitudinal ADL decline.

Three ADL clusters were identified: “Robust,” “Partially Impaired,” and “Impaired.” Over six years, transitions to worse functional states or mortality were common, particularly among those in the “Partially Impaired” and “Impaired” clusters. Participants in the “Robust” cluster who maintained functional independence demonstrated better physical and cognitive functions, healthier lifestyles, and optimal nutritional and inflammatory profiles. Random forest analysis revealed “Stairs” and “Dressing” as critical predictors of overall ADL deterioration.

The results contribute to the understanding of aging-related functional trajectories and offer actionable insights for healthcare planning and intervention development.

With global super-aging, understanding the longitudinal changes in activities of daily living (ADLs) among older adults is crucial for maintaining their functional independence, autonomy, and quality of life and mitigating economic burden. ADL impairment does not occur independently; rather, it is embedded within a broader framework of geriatric disablement that includes frailty, intrinsic capacity, and disability. Frailty and diminished intrinsic capacity often precede or serve as predictors of the onset of ADL disability among older adults [1–3]. Loss of ADL independence indicates health deterioration. It increases the need for care that affects individuals and national healthcare infrastructures [4,5]. Notably, ADL function is not a binary state (i.e., fully independent or dependent) but rather a continuum reflecting varying degrees of functional capacity. Diminished physical function in individuals aged 65 years or older begins with limitations in squatting, carrying weights, and walking; subsequently, their upper limb mobility and hearing function is limited before becoming completely dysfunctional [6]. Therefore, ADL function monitoring is vital for identifying older adults at risk of adverse outcomes and for designing interventions to preserve independence.

Japan, a country at the forefront of aging societies, provides a unique setting for studying these changes, particularly in the population aged 85 years and older. In 2021, 59.5% of individuals aged 85 years and older were recipients of Long-Term Care Insurance services that provide essential nursing care to older adults and individuals facing debilitating health conditions, including physical, cognitive, and mental impairments [7]. This figure dramatically surpasses the proportions for younger age groups. Evidence from Japan can serve as a foundation for addressing domestic challenges while offering insights for other countries undergoing similar demographic transitions.

Despite its importance, the natural history and variability of ADL transition in the very old population remains poorly understood. Aging is a highly individualized process with notable variability in robustness and resilience that affects the trajectories of functional decline and recovery among older adults [8,9]; however, few studies have employed person-centered analytic approaches that can capture the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of aging. Latent transition analysis (LTA) has recently emerged as a robust methodological framework for examining dynamic processes in longitudinal studies, particularly in the context of aging [10]. LTA models that transition between latent states over time provide deeper insights into the progression of aging-related processes. Large observational studies utilizing longitudinal data identified distinct functional statuses and transition patterns [4,6,11,12]. Among Chinese older adults aged 65 years or older, 71% of those with normal function and 68% of those with high-level impairment remained in the same state over the course of 4 years [11]. It could be hypothesized that even in a similar follow-up period, dynamic changes in physical function can be observed in octogenarians. Indeed, Kim et al. found that among community-dwelling adults aged 80 years and older, many maintained their instrumental ADL (IADL) levels during a 2-year follow-up period, whereas approximately 30% experienced IADL declines [13]. Slaug et al. found that many Western octogenarians demonstrated deterioration in visual or hearing function over a 9-year follow-up period [12]. Further studies are warranted to examine whether physical function level changes with aging in octogenarians and to determine the physical function that can serve as a key indicator for further deterioration.

Previous studies examined the association of LTA-based functional statuses and transition patterns with demographic and lifestyle factors [6,11]. Older age increases the likelihood of transitioning to a more impaired functional status [6,11]. Sex differences exist in the transition probabilities between functional statuses [11]. Social participation plays a protective role against physical function decline [11]. Existing literature shows the importance of blood-based biomarkers as early indicators of the development of future adverse events [14,15]. However, the association of blood-based biomarkers and functional profiles with transitions in later life remain poorly understood.

To address these gaps, this study examined 6-year ADL transition patterns among Japanese community-dwelling adults aged 85 years and older using LTA. Our objectives were to (1) identify distinct latent states of ADL function; (2) understand dynamic transitions over time; (3) determine key ADL functions that can predict worsening status; and (4) explore demographic, lifestyle, and biological predictors of these transitions.

We used longitudinal data from the Tokyo Oldest Old Survey on Total Health (TOOTH) study, a prospective observational cohort study designed to examine the overall health of community-dwelling older adults in Japan aged 85 years or older. Details of participant selection are described elsewhere [16]. Among the 542 participants (women,n= 306; men,n= 236; age, 87.8 ± 2.2 years) who underwent baseline examinations at the hospital and/or home between March 2008 and December 2009 (T1), we selected 538 (women, 56.3%; age, 87.8 ± 2.2 years) who had concurrent data on ADL at T1. Two follow-up examinations were conducted at 3 years (T2) and 6 years (T3) from enrollment. The total number of observations (person visit) was 1,614. The study protocol conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval of the ethics committees of the Keio University School of Medicine (no. 20070047), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The TOOTH study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry under ID UMIN000001842 (4/10/2009).

The Barthel index was used for assessing individual’s levels of independence in basic ADLs [17,18]. The index measures the ability to perform 10 tasks: feeding, bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, mobility, transferring, walking, climbing stairs, and continence. Each task is scored based on the level of assistance required, with higher scores indicating greater independence.

We collected information on vital status through annual phone calls between June 2009 and December 2015. At T2 and T3, we defined vital status into four categories: continuing, declined survey, lost to follow-up, and deceased. For those who were lost to follow-up, we used the later date (either the day of the last contact by annual phone calls or the participant’s last follow-up visit).

We assessed the general characteristics of the participants through face-to-face interviews. We used education (high school and higher education or not) and living arrangement (living alone or not) for the analysis.

Smoking (current smoker or not) and drinking (current drinker or not) habits were evaluated during the interview. We assessed physical activity in the past year using the modified Zutphen Physical Activity Questionnaire, which evaluates the frequency and duration of walking and subjective walking speed (i.e., cannot walk, calm, normal, and firm) as well as exercise and sports (type, duration, and frequency) [19]. We then estimated the total weekly metabolic equivalents (METs*h/w) using the Physical Activity Compendium [20]. The questionnaire was validated using a tri-axial accelerometer and physical functions such as chair stand test, timed-up and go test, and grip strength; the estimated METs*h/w was found to be negatively associated with mortality risk during a 6-year follow-up period in this population [21,22].

Frequencies of three cognitive activities and one social activity in the past year were assessed using a questionnaire (everyday, a couple of days in a week, once in a week, once in a month, less than once a month, and never), which were associated with the mini-mental state examination scores (MMSE) among TOOTH participants [23]. These activities included (1) reading newspapers, magazines, or books; (2) journaling and writing Japanese short poems (hai-ku/sen-ryu) or other types of poems; (3) drawing, painting, making crafts, or knitting; and (4) attending community association meetings or other meetings. As we found very small proportions in some ordinal values, we recategorized the frequencies as follows for further analysis: everyday, weekly, monthly or less, and never.

Body weight was measured while wearing light clothes and standing upright. Cognitive performance was measured using MMSE. For physical functions, hand grip strength measured using a dynamometer (T.K.K. 5401, Grip-D Takei, Tokyo, Japan), timed up and go test, and 30-s chair stand test were considered. These tests are validated and reliable measures for evaluating physical function in older adults [24–26].

Medical history was assessed through structured interviews by well-trained geriatricians and categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision categories. Diagnosed conditions included hypertension [I10], coronary heart disease [I20–I25], stroke [I60–I69], diabetes mellitus [E11], and hyperlipidemia [E78]. We defined diabetes when one or more of the following criteria were met: (1) self-reported diagnosis, (2) administration of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medications, (3) random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, or (4) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%. Hypertension was defined based on self-reported diagnosis or current use of antihypertensive medication. Anemia was defined as sex-specific hemoglobin levels (< 12 g/dL in women and < 13 g/dL in men).

Based on our previous findings in the association between biomarkers and mortality in the very old population, including centenarians, we selected seven biomarkers to examine the association with latent clusters and transition patterns [16,21,27]. Non-fasting blood samples were collected and stored at − 80 °C for subsequent analyses. Plasma levels of NT-proBNP were measured using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method (inter-assay coefficient of variations: 1.57%). High-molecular weight adiponectin concentrations were measured in duplicate using commercially available ELISA kits (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) with an inter-assay coefficient of variation of 11.0%. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha were quantified using high-sensitivity ELISA kits [Quantikine HS (Human IL-6), R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA; Quantikine HS (Human TNF-alpha), R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA; respectively], with inter-assay coefficients of variation of 9.43% and 8.72%, respectively. Plasma cystatin C was analyzed via a colloidal gold immunoassay method, with intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 1.72% and 0.79%, respectively (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Plasma cholinesterase activity was measured using the Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry proposed reference method; the intra-assay coefficient of variance was 1.08%; plasma albumin was quantified via the bromocresol purple method; and hemoglobin concentrations were measured using the automated method (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

Data of participant characteristics were presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (25th−75th percentile) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.

Following Vermunt and Magidson [28], we performed LTA with a three-step approach. First, we performed latent class analysis (LCA) to identify the number of latent clusters using 10 ordinal ADL variables at each time point. Assuming that missing values of ADL variables were missing completely at random or missing at random, we handled these missing values using full information maximum likelihood. We checked model local and global fit by examining bivariate variate residuals (BVR) among ADL variables and chi-square goodness-of-fit. When we found violated pairs of ADL variables, we added a log-linear local dependency term for the violated pairs of indicators one by one to loosen the local independence assumption and then rechecked BVRs among the variables. We ran the LCA model, setting 1 to 9 clusters. The model fit was evaluated using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). In addition, we checked whether the proportion of each cluster was too small and each cluster was distinct and interpretable when comparing ADL variables and participant characteristics. The interpretation of clusters was based on mean scores and probabilities across ADL measures. Furthermore, because numerous studies have consistently reported that age-related deterioration differs by age and sex, we ran conditional LCA models by including age and sex as covariates to examine whether these covariates had direct effects on ADL variables. We included age and sex separately in the selected model. For T2 and T3, after confirming whether the number of clusters remained consistent with those at T1 among participants who joined the follow-up survey, we conducted LCA, including the two known clusters relevant to vital states (i.e., continuing, declined survey, and deceased), ensuring accurate classification of individuals who exited the study due to death or non-participation.

Second, we assessed the plausibility of measurement invariance (MI) across time points. MI was checked by comparing fit indices and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) between two models with and without allowing latent class parameters to vary across time. Third, we ran a first-order autoregressive model to estimate the probabilities of transitioning between latent classes and death or declined survey over the study period.

To better understand major transition patterns, we examined participant characteristics in major transition patterns that accounted for 10% of the participants. To capture the characteristics of participants who stayed “Robust” throughout the follow-up, we compared the “Robust” group throughout the follow-up with the other transition patterns: “Robust” to “Deceased” and “Robust” (healthy longevity group) and “Robust” to “Deceased” (mortality risk group). Group comparisons were performed using a two-sample t-test for normal distribution variables, the Mann–Whitney test for non-normal distribution variables, and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.

Moreover, we ran a random forest algorithm to explore key predictors of longitudinal cluster worsening. Cluster worsening was operationalized as a binary outcome, where a transition to a higher-numbered cluster across time points was defined as worsening (i.e., we coded 1–5, where “Robust” was coded as 1, while “Deceased” was coded as 5), and no change or transition to a lower-numbered cluster was defined as no worsening. The predictors included 10 longitudinally measured Barthel indices. A random forest algorithm, a nonparametric ensemble learning method, was used to model the relationship between the ADL variables and the worsening of cluster status. The random forest algorithm was implemented using 500 trees to ensure the stability of variable importance estimates using therandomForestpackage in R. The number of predictors considered at each split was optimized using the square root of the total number of predictors. To address potential overfitting, out-of-bag error rates were used for internal validation. Variable importance was assessed using the Gini impurity criterion, which quantifies the reduction in node impurity when a specific variable is used to split the data.

We used R version 4.4.2 for building datasets, cluster comparisons, and a random forest; Latent GOLD software version 6.0 for LCA and LTA; and Python version 3.13.1 for creating a Sankey diagram. We set the level of statistical significance at p-value < 0.05 (two-sided) for all analyses, except the multiple comparison described above.

Table1shows the participant characteristics at T1. At T2, 311 of 538 participants (57.8%) joined the follow-up survey, 123 (22.9%) declined the survey, and 91 (16.9%) died before the survey. At T3, 117 participants (21.7%) joined the follow-up visit, 195 (36.2%) declined the survey, and 196 (36.4%) died. At baseline, compared with T1-only participants, participants who visited all time points were younger and were likely to have a drinking habit, large body weight, and improved results on hand grip strength and timed up and go test. They also had higher circulation levels of cholinesterase and lower circulation levels of adiponectin and CRP (Additional file 1).

Additional files 2 and 3 show the fit statistics of 1–9 clusters. Because BVRs indicated high correlation in two pairs of ADL variables (“Feeding” and “Toileting,” 599.4; “Transfers” and “Bladder,” 493.1), we added two log-linear local dependency terms to all models. Then, by running models of the 1–9 clusters, we found the lowest BIC in cluster 3 at T1 and T3 and in cluster 4 at T2. However, the elbow plot of BIC indicated a sharp reduction in the information criteria by cluster 3 and flattened out thereafter. Thus, we chose cluster 3 at T1 and cluster 5 by adding two known clusters at T2 and T3 (i.e., declined survey and deceased). Notably, when we checked whether age and sex had direct effects on ADL indicators at each time point, BVRs between age or sex and ADL indicators were consistently negligible (all values < 3.0; Additional file 4), implying that neither variable had direct effects on ADL indicators.

Additional file 5 shows box plots of ADL items by three clusters. We defined the first cluster as “Robust,” comprising 85.9% participants with the highest scores across most ADL variables. The mean ADL scores indicated high functionality. The second cluster was “Partially impaired,” comprising 10.4% participants with mild to moderate restrictions. ADL scores were distributed with the presence of “5” and some “10” values. The third cluster was “Impaired,” comprising 3.7% participants with severe restrictions. Most scores were “0,” indicating limitations in ADL.

Additional file 6 shows model comparisons between the measurement non-invariance model (MNI) and the MI model. The MNI model not only provided a significantly improved fit to the data based on the LRT but also demonstrated superior performance according to the Akaike information criterion and BIC. In addition, the entropy-based R² values for both models were high (0.954 for MI and 0.953 for MNI), indicating good classification quality across latent classes. Collectively, these parameters indicate that the MNI model offers a better balance between model fit and complexity than the MI model does.

Figure1shows a Sankey diagram to illustrate cluster sizes at each time point and transition probabilities throughout the study period. The transition probabilities between clusters from T1 to T2 indicated significant mobility between functional states. Among individuals classified as “Robust” at T1, while 55.4% remained in the “Robust” cluster at T2, 20.9% transitioned to the “Declined survey” cluster and 22.5% transitioned to the “Deceased” cluster. Only small proportions moved to the “Partially impaired” (3.2%) and “Impaired” clusters. In the “Partially impaired” cluster at T1, most participants (78.5%) remained “Partially impaired” at T2. However, 9.2% transitioned to the “Declined survey” cluster, and 9.3% transitioned to the “Deceased” cluster. Transitions to the “Robust” and “Impaired” clusters were less frequent, corresponding to 3.0% and 0.1% of cases, respectively. Participants classified as “Impaired” at T1 demonstrated strong stability, with 88.9% remaining in the “Impaired” cluster at T2. However, 5.6% transitioned to the “Declined survey” cluster, and another 5.6% transitioned to the “Deceased” cluster. Notably, no transitions were observed from the “Impaired” cluster to either the “Robust” or “Partially impaired” clusters.

Transition patterns between T2 and T3 highlighted the continued progression of functional states over time. In the “Robust” cluster at T2, 41.5% remained “Robust” at T3, while a substantial proportion (57.1%) transitioned to the “Declined survey” cluster. Transitions to the “Partially impaired” cluster were extremely small (1.4%), and no transitions were observed to the “Impaired” or “Deceased” clusters. The “Partially impaired” cluster at T2 exhibited moderate stability, with 50.0% remaining in the same state at T3. However, 46.4% transitioned to the “Declined survey” cluster, and 3.6% transitioned to the “Robust” cluster. No transitions were observed to the “Impaired” or “Deceased” clusters. Among participants classified as “Impaired” at T2, 85.0% remained in the “Impaired” cluster at T3, while 15.0% transitioned to the “Declined survey” cluster. Notably, no transitions occurred to the “Robust,” “Partially impaired,” or “Deceased” clusters from the “Impaired” state. The “Declined survey” cluster at T2 demonstrated bifurcated transition patterns, with 50.0% remaining in the “Declined survey” cluster at T3 and the remaining 50.0% transitioning to the “Deceased” cluster.

We identified 40 trajectory patterns, although most patterns had extremely small sample sizes (Additional file 7). The top five trajectory patterns accounting for approximately 10% each were as follows: (1) stayed “Robust” (n= 92, 17.1%); (2) “Robust” at T1 to “Deceased” at T2 (n= 71, 13.2%); (3) “Robust” at T1 and T2 and then “Declined survey” at T3 (n= 68, 12.6%); (4) “Robust” at T1 and then “Declined survey” at T2 and T3 (n= 61, 11.3%); and (5) “Robust” at T1 and T2, and then “Deceased” at T3 (n= 53, 9.9%). Compared with the mortality risk group, the healthy longevity group was younger, less likely to live alone, more likely to have a drinking habit, and demonstrated better cognitive and lower extremity physical functions. They also had higher physical activity levels, optimal sleep duration, and better nutrition and inflammation profiles, including higher cholinesterase and albumin levels and lower CRP levels.

In the random forest analysis, across the 10 ADL variables, “Stairs” was ranked as the second most important variable by both %IncMSE and IncNodePurity, implying that this ability would affect both the global predictive performance of the model and the local structure of the data (Fig.2). Other ADL variables showed divergent rankings between the two metrics. For instance, “Dressing” was ranked first by %IncMSE, indicating its contribution to global prediction accuracy, whereas “Mobility on level surface” was ranked first by IncNodePurity, indicating its role as a key node-splitting criterion in the decision tree structure.

Understanding the longitudinal transitions in ADL among very old adults is critical for tailoring interventions that support functional independence and reduce healthcare burdens in aging societies. This study provides novel insights into the ADL trajectories of community-dwelling octogenarians in Japan, using LTA to identify dynamic changes and associated factors over a 6-year period. The findings contribute to the limited body of literature on aging-related functional transitions in Asian populations, highlighting both the heterogeneity and predictability of these transitions.

As is typical in prospective cohort studies involving very old adults, TOOTH participants who kept joining the follow-up visits tended to have relatively healthy physical and cognitive functions as well as favorable biomarker profiles. High body weight may reflect better nutritional status as being underweight is often associated with frailty and increased mortality, particularly in older adults [29]. Similarly, although none of the participants were excessive drinkers, moderate alcohol consumption is potentially associated with increased appetite [30]. These findings may facilitate the interpretation of latent profiles and transition patterns in our study.

Our results revealed three distinct ADL clusters at each time point—“Robust,” “Partially impaired,” and “Impaired”—demonstrating varying degrees of stability and transition probabilities over time. Most participants in the “Robust” cluster at baseline remained functionally independent at a 6-year follow-up, although significant proportions transitioned to “Declined survey” or “Deceased” clusters, emphasizing the vulnerability of even the most robust older adults. Another study involving community-dwelling older adults in China (mean age, 85 years) employed a different approach in handling dropout in LTA [6]. The authors treated missing data that included death as missing at random. They argued that most missingness due to death would not bias model estimates. Contrarily, our study explicitly modeled “Declined survey” and “Deceased” as distinct absorbing states in the LTA as attrition is substantial in studies involving this age group. For example, a recent study that included older adults aged 80 years and older reported that more than 40% of the participants dropped out over a 9-year follow-up period [12]. In this age group, treating death or dropout as missing data may underestimate the likelihood of functional decline or overestimate the stability of preserved function.

Participants in the “Partially impaired” or “Impaired” clusters exhibited high stability, with very limited transitions to better ADL states. Our findings highlight the difficulty of recovery from impaired status to robust status among octogenarians once functional decline has occurred. The stability observed within the “Partially Impaired” and “Impaired” clusters suggests that transitions to better ADL states were rare, possibly reflecting the compounded impact of age-related physiological decline, comorbid conditions, and reduced resilience [8,9,31]. This trajectory contrasts with the conceptual framework of frailty, which implies a dynamic and potentially reversible state [32–34]. However, notably, frailty includes multiple domains such as physical, cognitive, and social frailties as well as deficit accumulation, with each domain having its own dynamics and potentiality of reversibility. ADL represents a core component of physical function but does not capture the whole concept of frailty. Therefore, stability or ADL status decline does not necessarily represent all aspects of frailty. Previous studies have reported that even among older adults with functional limitations, interventions have improved certain domains of frailty [35–37]. However, our study captures the natural history of ADL transitions in the absence of interventions. The observed trajectory patterns indicate that once functional decline occurs in octogenarians, recovery of physical function is considerably rare. Instead, our results suggest that functional impairments at an advanced age are likelier to represent a progressive or stable state rather than a reversible condition. These findings underscore the critical importance of early interventions aimed at preventing transitions to impaired states to maintain independence and quality of life in this population.

The transition patterns observed in this study align with previous research in Western populations that used LTA to examine health-related transitions [12]. However, our study extends this knowledge by focusing on ADL, a critical domain of functional health, and by examining a rapidly aging demographic in Japan. Notably, the high mortality rates among “Robust” individuals transitioning to the “Deceased” cluster indicate that functional status alone may not fully capture mortality risk. Indeed, our results highlight the need for comprehensive assessments incorporating physical, cognitive, and biological markers to better predict all-cause mortality. Among the 40 trajectory patterns identified, the five most common accounted for nearly half of the participants. These patterns highlight the importance of demographic, lifestyle, and biological factors in influencing functional trajectories. Compared to those who declined ADL, participants who maintained “Robust” status throughout the study were younger, had better physical and cognitive functions, and demonstrated healthier lifestyle profiles, including higher physical activity levels, optimal sleep duration, and better nutritional and inflammatory profiles. These findings align with studies that emphasize the protective role of these factors in aging [38,39].

Notably, individuals who maintained a robust status throughout the follow-up period tended to have favorable baseline biomarker profiles. These findings have potential relevance for not only mortality risk but also functional status in later life, thus extending previous findings [16,27]. The present results suggest that a preserved cardiovascular system, kidney and liver functions, and lower systemic inflammation potentially contribute to ADL maintenance in the very old population [16,21,27]. As our study focused on the association between baseline biomarker levels and 6-year ADL transitions, it remains unclear whether changes in biomarker levels are associated with ADL transitions. Future studies incorporating repeated biomarker measures are warranted to explore these dynamic relationships.

While the number of clusters was identical through three time points, MNI inclusion improved the model fit, suggesting that latent class parameters vary across time points, reflecting the dynamic nature of aging. Consistent with Ferrucci’s work, the NewCastle 85 + study whose participants were community-dwelling octogenarians highlighted hierarchical patterns of ADLs, demonstrating the order in which specific abilities decline [8,40]. In these previous studies, functional abilities were categorized into four domains: abilities for complex manual dexterity; abilities to walk long distances; abilities for standing balance and good upper limb control; and abilities to maintain good upper limb control with a sitting position. “Stairs” and “Dressing” were categorized into the second and third domains, respectively. While these studies focus on understanding the sequence of ADL loss with a cross-sectional study design, our findings extend this framework in that we identified the ADL declines that serve as markers for future overall ADL deterioration. By examining ADL cluster transitions as the outcome, we found that declines in “Stairs” and “Dressing” were critical predictors of overall functional decline within 3 years. Combined with previous findings, our results suggest that targeted interventions to preserve these specific functions can have broader implications for maintaining overall independence. For instance, exercise programs focusing on lower extremity strength and balance could be integrated into community-based programs to maximize their reach and effectiveness.

An important strength of our study is its longitudinal design, with multiple assessments of the identical ADL questionnaire and comprehensive measurements during the 6-year follow-up period. However, several limitations warrant consideration. First, the reliance on the Barthel index, while widely used, may not capture the full spectrum of ADL capabilities, particularly in culturally specific contexts. Future studies should consider incorporating additional measures of instrumental ADL and environmental factors that influence functional independence. Second, the study population comprised Japanese community-dwelling older adults, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Comparative studies across diverse cultural and healthcare settings are needed to validate and extend these results. Third, during the follow-up period, the proportion of participants who declined survey increased. The reasons varied, such as loss of self-confidence to join the survey or even go outside and family members being concerned about the participant joining the survey. Slaug et al. [12] also reported that 40% of participants aged 80−89 years at baseline dropped out during a 9-year follow-up; the proportion of participants who declined the survey in our study is comparable. Finally, while the random forest analysis identified key predictors of cluster transitions, the underlying mechanisms driving these transitions remain unclear. Future research should explore the interplay between physical, cognitive, and biological factors in shaping functional trajectories.

This study advances our understanding of aging-related functional transitions by characterizing ADL trajectories and their predictors in a cohort of older adults in Japan. The findings highlight the heterogeneity of aging processes and the critical need for tailored interventions to support functional independence. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, this study provides a foundation for future research and practical strategies to address the challenges of super-aging societies.
