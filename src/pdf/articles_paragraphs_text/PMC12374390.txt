Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe anomaly associated with significant pulmonary hypertension (PH) and high mortality, often requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Early prognostic markers are essential to guide clinical decisions. This study evaluated the prognostic value of right-to-left (R-L) shunting in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) during the early postnatal period in predicting ECMO use and mortality in neonates with CDH.

This retrospective cohort study included neonates with CDH admitted between 2013 and 2024. Echocardiographic evaluations within 24 h of birth categorized PDA shunting as left-to-right (L-R), R-L, or bidirectional. Outcomes were analyzed using two models. First, the pure R-L shunt group was compared with the combined L-R and bidirectional shunt groups. Second, bidirectional shunts were subclassified as L-R or R-L predominant based on Doppler spectral area, with the R-L predominant group analyzed together with the pure R-L shunt group and the L-R predominant group analyzed with the L-R shunt group. Primary outcomes were ECMO use or mortality, analyzed using logistic regression.

Among 145 neonates, both models demonstrated that R-L shunting was associated with a higher ECMO requirement or increased mortality rate compared to L-R shunting (p< 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified R-L shunting as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (Model 1: odds ratio [OR] 6.785, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.333–19.730;p< 0.001; Model 2: OR 4.067, 95% CI 1.444–11.455;p= 0.008).

The direction of early postnatal R-L PDA shunt, assessed within 24 h of birth, was significantly associated with ECMO use or mortality in neonates with CDH.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a critical congenital anomaly affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 to 5,000 live births. It is characterized by the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, both mechanical compression and impaired fetal lung development contribute to the disruption of pulmonary and cardiovascular development in CDH [1–3]. Left ventricular hypoplasia further exacerbates pulmonary hypertension (PH), a major determinant of prognosis, significantly increasing the risk of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use and mortality [4–6]. Despite advances in medical and surgical interventions, including ECMO, CDH remains associated with a persistently high mortality rate of approximately 30% [3]. Early and accurate prognostic evaluation is crucial to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes for affected neonates.

Echocardiography is a key diagnostic tool for assessing PH and other CDH-related complications [4,7,8]. It provides non-invasive insights into pulmonary hemodynamics and cardiac function. However, conventional echocardiographic parameters, such as pulmonary artery dimensions and ventricular function, are subject to significant inter-operator variability due to technical difficulties and patient condition [9]. These limitations highlight the need for objective, reproducible, and clinically practical prognostic markers.

The flow direction through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) has emerged as a simple yet powerful diagnostic tool. PDA flow reflects the balance between pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. Right-to-left (R-L) shunting indicates elevated pulmonary pressures and hemodynamic instability, correlating with severe disease and poor outcomes [10]. This parameter is accessible, reproducible, and well-suited for early postnatal assessments.

This study evaluated the predictive value of early postnatal echocardiographic assessment of PDA shunt direction in neonates with CDH. We hypothesize that PDA shunt direction is a practical and reliable marker of disease severity and outcomes, influencing ECMO use and mortality risk. This research aims to support the development of standardized approaches for early risk stratification in CDH management.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center from August 2013 to October 2024. Both left-sided and right-sided CDH cases were included. Exclusion criteria included neonates born before 35 weeks of gestation, out-born neonates, neonates with major congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities, absence of PDA flow on echocardiographic images, and failure to undergo echocardiography within the first 24 h postnatally. Demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic data were collected through a review of medical records. Demographic data included gestational age, birth weight, sex, delivery method, and hospital stay duration. Clinical data included the 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores, CDH laterality, the observed/expected lung-to-head ratio (O/E LHR) measured using the tracing method during the prenatal period, liver herniation, defect size, need for patch, need for ECMO, and mortality. The first measured value was used for analysis in neonates with multiple prenatal O/E LHR measurements to ensure consistency and relevance [11]. Two comparison models were used in this study: Model 1 compared the pure R-L shunt group with the combined left-to-right (L-R) and bidirectional shunt groups. Model 2 further classified bidirectional shunts as L-R or R-L predominant based on Doppler spectral area. The R-L predominant group was analyzed together with the pure R-L shunt group, while the L-R predominant group was included in the L-R shunt group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality or the need for ECMO support during hospitalization.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Asan Medical Center (IRB No. 2024–2412), and the requirement for informed patient consent was waived.

In this study, transthoracic echocardiography was performed by neonatologists within 24 h of birth, with all data subsequently reviewed by a consistent team of pediatric cardiologists. Echocardiography was conducted using a Philips EPIQ 7 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA). Echocardiographic data were retrieved from electronic medical records. In cases with incomplete records, two-dimensional analysis was performed using TomTec®software (TomTec Imaging Systems; GmbH, Unterschleissheim, Germany). PDA shunt flow direction and size were evaluated in the high parasternal short axis view, and patients were categorized into L-R and R-L shunt groups. For bidirectional shunting, the predominance of R-L shunting was determined based on whether the Doppler spectral area of R-L flow exceeded that of L-R flow, indicating a greater net blood volume shunted in the R-L direction over the cardiac cycle.

Patients were managed according to a standardized CDH treatment protocol. Upon birth, patients were immediately intubated in the delivery room, and an orogastric tube was inserted to decompress the bowel. Following admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), patients were initially managed with conventional ventilation, employing permissive hypercapnia while limiting peak inspiratory pressure. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation was introduced for refractory hypercapnia or high peak inspiratory pressures. Pulmonary hypertension was managed with inotropic agents, including milrinone and norepinephrine. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) was administered if the left ventricular function was preserved. ECMO was indicated for infants with a gestational age of ≥ 34 + 0 weeks or a birth weight of ≥ 2,000 g, provided they had no lethal congenital anomalies or severe intracranial hemorrhage. ECMO was initiated based on the following criteria: (1) hypoxic respiratory failure, defined as failure to wean from 100% oxygen or oxygenation index (OI) > 40 for > 6 h; (2) hypercapnic respiratory failure, defined as PaCO2> 70 mm Hg with pH < 7.15 with peak inspiratory pressure > 30 cm H2O, or frequency < 7 Hz with amplitude > 40; and (3) systemic hypotension, defined as mean arterial pressure < 40 mm Hg due to PH unresponsive to fluid and inotropic therapy. Surgical repair was performed following stabilization of PH and ventilation or following ECMO decannulation.

Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 27; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables as absolute numbers and percentages. Comparisons between categorical variables were made using the chi-squared test, while continuous variables were analyzed using independent t-tests. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical and echocardiographic variables, including PDA shunt direction, and outcomes such as ECMO requirement and mortality. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to quantify the strength of associations. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

A total of 248 neonates with CDH were identified. Of these, 103 were excluded: 15 for preterm birth (< 35 weeks of gestation), 29 for major congenital anomalies, 43 for the absence of echocardiographic evaluation within 24 h of birth, and 16 for no visible PDA flow on echocardiography. The final cohort included 145 neonates.

Initial echocardiographic assessment classified PDA shunting as pure L-R (n= 21), pure R-L (n= 43), or bidirectional (n= 81). Among bidirectional shunts, 51 were categorized as L-R predominant and 30 as R-L predominant based on Doppler spectral analysis. In Model 1, the final classification resulted in two groups: the L-R group (n= 102) and the R-L group (n= 43). In Model 2, bidirectional shunts were reclassified, with 72 in the L-R predominant group and 73 in the R-L predominant group (Fig.1).

The baseline characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table1. In both models, significant differences were observed between the L-R and R-L groups for O/E LHR, liver herniation, 1-minute Apgar score, and 5-minute Apgar score (p< 0.001). Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Study Group classification data on defect size were available for 124 patients; missing data corresponded to patients who either did not undergo surgical intervention or lacked available medical records. Significant differences in defect size and the necessity for patch repair were observed between the L-R shunt group and the R-L shunt group in both Model 1 and Model 2. No significant differences were noted in sex, gestational age, birth weight, CDH laterality, delivery method, or hospital stay duration. Risk factors for mortality or ECMO requirement are detailed in Table2, with significant associations identified for O/E LHR, liver herniation, PDA size, and PDA shunt direction.

Among the 145 neonates included in Model 1, 102 were classified into the L-R and bidirectional shunt group. Of these, 17 (16.7%) required ECMO support, with six patients dying despite intervention. One additional patient died without receiving ECMO, resulting in a total of 18 (17.6%) neonates who met the composite outcome of ECMO use or mortality. In contrast, among the 43 neonates with R-L shunting, 25 (58.1%) required ECMO support, of whom 14 died despite intervention. An additional seven patients died without ECMO support, yielding a total of 32 (74.4%) with the composite outcome. R-L shunting was significantly associated with higher odds of ECMO requirement or mortality compared to L-R shunting (OR 13.6, 95% CI 5.8–31.9;p< 0.001; Table3).

In Model 2, nine (12.5%) in the L-R predominant group required ECMO, and three (4.2%) died despite intervention. In contrast, 41 neonates (56.2%) in the R-L predominant group experienced adverse outcomes. Of these, 33 (45.2%) required ECMO, with 17 deaths despite intervention, and eight additional deaths occurred without ECMO, resulting in an overall mortality of 25 (34.2%). R-L predominant shunting was significantly associated with increased odds of ECMO requirement or mortality (OR 8.97, 95% CI 3.88–20.73;p< 0.001; Table3).

Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, liver herniation, and O/E LHR, identified PDA shunt direction as a predictor of adverse outcomes (Model 1: OR 6.785, 95% CI 2.333–19.730;p< 0.001; Model 2: OR 4.067, 95% CI 1.444–11.455;p= 0.008; Fig.2).

This study highlighted the prognostic value of R-L shunting in the PDA among neonates with CDH, demonstrating its significant association with increased ECMO utilization and higher mortality rates. Notably, this association persisted regardless of how R-L shunting was classified, with both analytical models yielding consistent results, further strengthening its clinical relevance. Furthermore, in both models, multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, liver herniation, and O/E LHR, identified PDA shunt direction as a predictor of adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the critical role of PDA shunt direction as a key clinical marker and are consistent with previous studies indicating that severe PH exacerbates hemodynamic instability, often necessitating more aggressive interventions [12,13].

The R-L flow in the PDA reflects an imbalance in pulmonary and systemic pressures, indicating a more critical clinical state. Our findings that neonates with R-L shunting had significantly lower O/E LHR and higher liver herniation rates support the hypothesis that more significant compression of thoracic structures exacerbates PH. These structural and functional alterations likely contribute to the reversal of shunt direction, consistent with earlier studies [14–16].

Previous echocardiographic studies have emphasized the utility of various indices for evaluating PH severity, such as tricuspid regurgitation velocity, interventricular septal flattening, and pulmonary artery acceleration time/right ventricular ejection time ratios [8,17,18]. However, these methods are limited by technical challenges, inconsistent visualization, and lower applicability in critically ill neonates. For instance, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity cannot be reliably assessed in up to 30% of patients with CDH due to poor acoustic windows or diminished right ventricular function [8,19]. Similarly, at our center, we frequently observed that significant TR velocity was undetectable in neonates with CDH despite clinical suspicion of PH. Additionally, the accuracy of pulmonary artery acceleration time measurements in the right ventricular outflow tract can be compromised by flow turbulence, which distorts the spectral Doppler envelope and can obscure the precise identification of peak pulmonary arterial flow velocity, affecting the reliability of these measurements [20].

PDA shunt direction serves as a real-time indicator of hemodynamic compromise, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions regarding the timing of ECMO initiation or modifications in ventilatory support, such as transitioning to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. Its straightforward and reproducible nature makes it well-suited for integration into standardized risk stratification protocols, promoting greater consistency in assessing CDH severity across institutions. This represents a notable strength of our investigation, demonstrating that accurate prognostic assessment can be achieved through the clear differentiation of R-L and L-R shunting patterns using color Doppler imaging, rather than depending on less reproducible parameters.

In both Method 1 and Method 2, patients with R-L shunt demonstrated significantly larger PDA diameters, consistent with previous reports [13]. In typical postnatal transition, the ductus arteriosus constricts in response to increased oxygen tension via smooth muscle contraction. However, in the presence of a R-L shunt, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure may impair systemic oxygenation, potentially delaying ductal constriction compared to L-R shunting.

In the context of the growing use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in NICUs, the direction of the PDA shunt further underscores its clinical utility. Its role in providing hemodynamic insights aligns closely with the simplicity and reproducibility of PDA shunt evaluation [21].

Although the findings of this study are valuable, it is important to address a few limitations. First, as a retrospective, single-center study, the generalizability of the findings is limited. While we included a relatively large cohort, over 100 patients were excluded based on strict criteria, introducing potential selection bias. Importantly, baseline characteristics between included and excluded patients showed no significant differences, aside from prognostic factors, suggesting minimal impact on outcome validity. Second, we did not account for the potential effects of inotropic support on PDA shunt direction. Inotropes could mask underlying R-L shunting by augmenting left ventricular function and systemic pressures. Further prospective studies are needed to disentangle these confounding effects. Third, although a Velocity-time-integral based classification system may reduce inter-operator variability, it was not applied in this study due to technical limitations. However, all echocardiographic assessments were performed by experienced pediatric cardiologists, which minimized the potential for inter-observer variability. Fourth, although multivariate analyses were adjusted for major prognostic factors, residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out due to baseline differences between groups in Apgar scores, O/E LHR, liver herniation status, and diaphragmatic defect size. Fifth, this study was conducted in a clinical context where fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion (FETO) was not performed. While this may limit generalizability to FETO-treated populations, excluding such cases allows for a more accurate evaluation of unmodified CDH physiology and ensures that the observed associations reflect the natural disease course and early postnatal management strategies. Lastly, although R-L shunting was strongly associated with adverse outcomes, a subset of patients in the R-L group survived without ECMO or mortality. This variability underscores the qualitative nature of PDA direction assessment and highlights the need for complementary quantitative measures of PH severity.

Nevertheless, our study has notable strengths. The robust sample size and systematic echocardiographic evaluation process, including initial assessments by neonatologists and thorough reviews conducted by a consistent team of pediatric cardiologists, ensured accurate and clinically impactful findings. This dual-layered evaluation offers a pragmatic approach to early prognostication in CDH and facilitates timely decision-making for ECMO initiation.

In conclusion, this study establishes the role of early postnatal PDA shunt direction as a reliable marker for predicting ECMO requirement and mortality in neonates with CDH. By providing a reproducible and accessible method for early risk stratification, PDA shunt direction can enhance decision-making and outcomes in this high-risk population. The growing use of POCUS further underscores its potential for real-time integration into diagnostic workflows, ultimately improving care in diverse clinical settings.
