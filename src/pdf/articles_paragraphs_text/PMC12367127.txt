Emerging in late 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak rapidly evolved into an unprecedented global public health crisis. While exposing critical health system weaknesses, the pandemic also spurred innovation and investment, including rapid vaccine development. This paper examines Ethiopia’s multi-tiered health system response, exploring the strategies, enabling conditions, barriers, and lessons learned. We conducted a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study across all tiers of Ethiopia’s health system from August to December 2023. Data came from three concurrent components: a quantitative survey of implementers (n = 952), key-informant interviews (n = 80), and administrative data. An additional 233 health workers were surveyed to assess intervention integration. Study tools were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and WHO pillars. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data underwent framework analysis, followed by synthesis and triangulation. Results show Ethiopia rapidly expanded laboratory capacity, increasing RT-PCR sites from one (February 2020) to 72 (June 2020), and developed genomic sequencing. Critical care capacity grew, supported by the acquisition of over 764 oxygen concentrators, 320 mechanical ventilators, and remote workforce training. Rapid vaccine deployment and cold chain expansion facilitated over 68 million people receiving at least one dose. The country gained valuable experience in community engagement and deployed over 3,000 rapid response teams. While initial political will and engagement were strong, it waned over time. Consequently, despite efforts to integrate and institutionalize, some key interventions—including surveillance, laboratory testing, and case management—declined as the pandemic’s urgent phase passed and political engagement diminished. In conclusion, the Ethiopian health system gained experiences and tools in critical care, laboratory testing, rapid vaccine deployment, and community engagement. If institutionalized and sustained, these capacities can significantly strengthen Ethiopia’s health system and enhance its resilience. To fully integrate and institutionalize these platforms for future emergencies, robust monitoring is essential.

Emerging in late 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak rapidly evolved into an unprecedented global public health crisis [1–4]. By April 2023, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it no longer a public health emergency of international concern, the virus had infected over 765 million people and claimed more than 6.9 million lives globally [5]. While the pandemic exposed critical weaknesses in health systems and global coordination, it also spurred innovation and renewed investment in public health infrastructure, including the rapid development and deployment of vaccines [6].

To support national responses, WHO introduced a strategic framework encompassing eleven key response pillars, including coordination, risk communication, surveillance, laboratory testing, and case management [7]. These pillars align closely with core components of primary health care and broader health system functions, highlighting the potential of pandemic response strategies to enhance long-term system strengthening efforts.

In Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported in March 2020 [8]. Despite resource constraints and limited preparedness [9], the government mounted a comprehensive response aligned with WHO guidance. These efforts included establishing multi-sectoral coordination, fostering community engagement, expanding surveillance and testing, improving case management, and launching national vaccination efforts [10]. A national state of emergency was declared, followed by a series of public health and social measures, including school closures, restrictions on gatherings, suspension of religious services, travel limitations, and quarantine protocols. Public awareness campaigns were also launched to promote preventive practices. These interventions aimed to delay virus transmission, reduce strain on the health system, and buy time to scale up the country’s preparedness and response capacity [11].

This study was conducted in Ethiopia shortly after the WHO lifted the global emergency status for COVID-19. It aimed to examine how the country implemented its response across various levels of the health system, exploring the strategies adopted, enabling conditions, barriers encountered, and lessons learned. Particular attention is given to how key interventions were integrated into and sustained by the broader primary health care system. Through this analysis, we aim to contribute to the global evidence base on how health systems can operate and adapt during large-scale public health crises, and leverage these insights to strengthen health systems and health security.

We conducted a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study across all tiers of Ethiopia’s health system. Data came from three concurrent components: a quantitative survey, key-informant interviews, and administrative data. The survey quantified the prevalence and perceived importance of implementation factors (contributors and barriers), while the key informant interviews added rich narratives on challenges, lessons learned and successes. Administrative data offered objective indicators and trends that anchored the other findings, such as changes in the availability of laboratories, critical care facilities, and vaccines.

We adapted the sampling strategy proposed by Peter et al. [12] to identify populations of actors involved in complex and multi-institutional initiatives. This approach consisted of three key steps: identifying the target population or population universe, defining the source population, and drawing samples from the source population. In this context, the target population was defined as all individuals meeting the inclusion criteria, while the source population referred to the practically accessible segment of this target population who could be feasibly reached for data collection. Hence, the target population in Ethiopia comprised individuals who had been directly involved in the implementation of COVID-19-related activities for a continuous period of 12 months or more between January 2020 and April 2023. Implementing activities refer to all aspects of the COVID-19 response, including coordination, resource mobilization, risk communication, surveillance, laboratory testing, case management, logistics and supply chain management, infection prevention and control, continuity of essential services, research, data management, and vaccination efforts.

Sampling was stratified by both the type of activity conducted and the geographic location to ensure representation across all pillars of the COVID-19 response and the major contextual settings of the country: urban, agrarian, and pastoralist areas. The country was first stratified into these three contexts, from which five regions were randomly selected. Within each selected region, institutions leading the COVID-19 response were identified. From these institutions, all individuals involved in implementing the response who met the inclusion criteria were listed. Individuals were then randomly selected from these lists for a quantitative survey. In cases where only one eligible individual was available, that individual was included (Fig 1). A subset of these quantitative survey participants was then purposively selected for key informant interviews.

Our quantitative survey employed a complex sampling design, which included adjustments for the design effect and potential non-response, to estimate the minimum sample size. This estimation resulted in the inclusion of 952 eligible individuals in the study. Of these, 80 participants were also selected for key informant interviews, with their number determined by data saturation. Additionally, 233 health workers were enrolled from health facilities to specifically assess the implementation of key pandemic response interventions within these facilities and examine their integration into the broader health system.

We developed and tested three data collection tools: a structured questionnaire for the quantitative survey, a separate structured questionnaire for individuals working in health facilities, and a semi-structured interview guide for key informant interviews. All tools were developed informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains and designed to cover all WHO pillars of the COVID-19 response. Following tool development, enumerators were recruited and received five days of training, which included pilot testing of the tools outside the study areas. Most interviews were conducted face-to-face; however, a few were conducted virtually via video calls. Virtual interviews were arranged for key individuals who played major roles in the response, were included in the sample, but were unavailable for face-to-face interviews during the data collection period. To ensure data accuracy, all key informant interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data collection was carried out between August and December 2023.

Data analysis was conducted at three levels: quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, and synthesis and triangulation. The quantitative survey data underwent descriptive analysis, identifying barriers and facilitators to the implementation of COVID-19 response interventions. This analysis also assessed the level of adoption of guidelines and practices at the health facility level. Guided by CFIR domains and constructs, the analysis examined determinants across the health system, political, economic, social, and technological environments, incorporating both outer and inner CFIR settings. Additionally, trends in key service indicators were computed from the administrative data.

For the qualitative component—including key informant interviews and document reviews—an initial codebook was developed based on the study objectives, the WHO COVID-19 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework, and the interview guide. The codebook was refined following a preliminary review of KII transcripts. Two independent coders conducted detailed line-by-line coding. A framework analysis approach was applied, using both deductive and inductive methods: predefined themes guided the deductive process, while the inductive approach allowed new insights to emerge directly from the data. Atlas.ti software facilitated systematic organization and retrieval of coded content.

Finally, findings from the quantitative and qualitative strands were triangulated to build a comprehensive understanding of the barriers, facilitators, successes, and lessons learned. Data from all sources were synthesized to enhance interpretation and insight. The robustness of the evidence supporting key findings was assessed across three dimensions: the number of data sources (single vs. multiple), the type of data (perception-based vs. fact-based), and the overall quality of the data.

The Ethiopian Public Health Institute Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (Protocol Number: EPHI-IRB-512–2023). Recruitment of study participants took place from August 7, 2023, to December 15, 2023, in accordance with ethical guidelines. As per IRB approval, verbal consent was obtained from all participants after they received and read the consent form, which detailed the study’s purpose, potential benefits, risks, and possible harms. Participants provided verbal agreement to proceed with the interview, and the interviewer documented consent by marking a designated section on the form. All completed consent forms were securely retained to ensure proper ethical documentation and compliance. Additionally, all data were deidentified and stored on a secured, password-protected device to maintain participant confidentiality and data security.

Table 1presents an overview of study respondents’ engagement across various COVID-19 pillars from January 2020 to April 2023. More than one out of two (56.0%) respondents participated in the Vaccination pillar. This was followed by Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) (52.0%), and Infection Prevention and Control (49.5%).

IPC = Infection prevention and control; RCCE = Risk communication and community engagement.

The government of Ethiopia established a range of directives and regulatory frameworks to facilitate the implementation of the COVID-19 response interventions, particularly during the initial phase of the pandemic, and was able to step-up its efforts to slow down the spread of the virus. The political environment was cited as a key contributor to Ethiopia’s COVID-19 response. As shown inTable 2, respondents identified a conducive political environment as a contributing factor in maintaining essential health services (64.7%), managing points of entry (63.0%), RCCE (62.0%), IPC (61.8%), vaccination (60.4%), surveillance and outbreak investigation (60.4%), case management (56.2%), logistics and supply systems (52.2%), and laboratory testing (46.2%).

There were challenges in the coordination mechanisms specifically at the early phase of the pandemic. Conflict compromised the implementation of the COVID-19 national and sub-national responses, as the public failed to honor directives and government officials were unable to proactively engage in the task force as they prioritized other public demands. Furthermore, following the war in northern Ethiopia, the government’s focus shifted to security, resulting in little engagement in the COVID-19 response. In the Amhara region, a respondent specifically highlighted the significant impact of the war on the COVID-19 response efforts within the region.

Initially, the surveillance and data capture system relied on Excel, leading to issues with missing, inconsistent, and untimely data. However, the Ministry of Health leadership later prioritized digitalization, resulting in a fully digital system with integrated data interfaces, streamlining data from various sources.

Although Ethiopia set up a network of point-of-entry surveillance systems, porous borders and limited cross-border collaboration remained significant challenges. The absence of cross-border surveillance mechanisms further impeded effective outbreak investigations. In areas lacking formal checkpoints, people crossed the borders unchecked, mingling with nearby communities and breaching prevention guidelines.

Despite these initial setbacks, as the pandemic evolved, Ethiopia was able to expand testing centers. The country conducted an inventory of available PCR machines, including those in research centers across sectors like agriculture and higher education. Collaborative platforms were established with these organizations, enabling the repurposing of existing machines and enhancing testing capacity. Moreover, private laboratories in Addis Ababa played a role in expanding testing facilities by offering COVID-19 RT-PCR testing, particularly for travelers. Consequently, the number of laboratories equipped with RT-PCR testing capacity increased from just one in February 2020 to seventy-two by June 2020 (Fig 2).

In the middle of the pandemic, Ethiopia approved and deployed antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in areas where RT-PCR testing was not available. By 2022, 1,442 health facilities were conducting Ag-RDT testing for COVID-19. Over time, the automation of laboratory processes further enhanced daily testing capacity. The advent of rapid diagnostic tests and expansion of RT-PCR testing centers improved access to laboratory testing. In 2021, close to 78% of case management and isolation centers had standard operating procedures (SOPs) to conduct onsite COVID-19 testing, while it steadily declined there after (Fig 3).

In addition, ensuring access for all populations to laboratory services remained challenging due to Ethiopia’s vast geography and the growing number of COVID-19 cases. To address access issues in remote areas without testing centers, samples were collected and transported using existing infrastructure. Ethiopia’s COVID-19 testing strategy utilized the country’s established systems and experiences for sample collection, transport, and testing, which were already in place for diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, and sentinel surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and Influenza-like illnesses.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Ethiopia had limited capacity to manage severe COVID-19 cases, as unanimously noted by all key informants. The country was grappling with a lack of trained health providers, ventilators and other essential equipment and supplies for critical care, although case management centers were established early in the pandemic. To address this, an online training platform was established, and several health providers were trained remotely.

By the end of 2021, the number of case management centers established nationwide reached 155. With the expansion of case management centers, the number of critical care devices also grew. Throughout the pandemic, Ethiopia secured over 764 oxygen concentrators and 320 mechanical ventilators (Fig 4).

As case management centers expanded, the inadequate availability and unsuitability of personal protective equipment (PPE) jeopardized the safety and well-being of frontline health workers, increasing their risk of contracting the virus while treating patients. This shortage also heightened the risk of COVID-19 transmission within health facility premises, further disrupting essential health services in both case management centers and other facilities. In the later stages of the pandemic, improvements in PPE availability and usage, along with increased awareness among health workers and the public, led to a reduction in disruptions to essential services (Fig 5).

A subcommittee under the national COVID-19 task force was established to coordinate logistics and supply availability, focusing initially on items such as PPE, mechanical ventilators, laboratory devices, and, later, vaccines. This committee, composed of members from the Ministry of Health and other sectors, was instrumental in ensuring efficient resource distribution.

The commencement of the COVID-19 vaccination initiative in Ethiopia occurred exactly one year after the country’s first reported COVID-19 case. COVID-19 vaccination started within the established EPI structures and coordination platforms, leveraging their existing functions. These included utilizing pre-existing advisory groups and committees like the Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC) and the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG).

Ethiopia aimed to vaccinate up to 20% of the target population in the first phase of its vaccination initiative [13]. However, the country only managed to vaccinate 3% of the target within six months. While limited vaccine stock was a challenge, an ineffective vaccination strategy was also another barrier at the first stage of the vaccination drive. When the initial approach failed to reach target populations, Ethiopia adopted a hybrid delivery strategy with campaign style approach playing a central role, allowing the program to access underserved groups and substantially increasing the number of people receiving vaccine doses (Fig 6). Beyond increasing vaccine uptake, this approach offered opportunities to integrate other services, such as identifying and reducing the number of zero-dose children.

Moreover, Ethiopia enhanced its cold chain infrastructure, particularly the ultracold chain capacity. With support from development partners, ultracold chain facilities were established in all regions of the country, significantly increasing their availability.

The Ministry of Health developed guidelines and has begun integrating COVID-19 response activities and strategies into the broader health system since 2022. According to these guidelines, all health facilities were expected to incorporate COVID-19 measures into routine services, as the disease had transitioned to an endemic phase. The plan called for integrating laboratory testing with existing services and aligning COVID-19 surveillance with established disease surveillance protocols. Additionally, a national effort documented best practices for sustained use beyond the outbreak. However, these best practices were not done at lower levels. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a steady decline in COVID-19-related activities within health facilities even prior to 2023, when COVID-19 was still considered a public health emergency of international concern. As shown inFig 3, the percentage of facilities equipped with functional lifesaving devices and supplies to manage COVID-19 cases dropped from 79.9% in 2021 to 40.3% in 2023. Similarly, the proportion of facilities with SOPs for laboratory testing and specimen transport for COVID-19 declined from 81.5% in 2021 to 43.3% in 2023.

Ethiopia implemented a comprehensive set of interventions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, despite facing numerous challenges. Key measures included multi-sectoral collaboration and action, point-of-entry screening and quarantine, active case finding and isolation, community engagement, expansion of testing and case management facilities, and later, vaccination efforts. With strong political commitment from the outset, Ethiopia swiftly engaged various sectors and mobilized resources and personnel. Early in the outbreak, the government established 27 points of entry equipped with staff and facilities to screen and quarantine travelers, aiming to prevent the importation and spread of the virus.

At the onset of the pandemic, Ethiopia had limited capacity for laboratory testing and managing severe COVID-19 cases [9]. When the WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, Ethiopia lacked laboratories capable of conducting SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR tests and had insufficient life-saving equipment to manage severe cases. This was a common challenge among many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems were generally weak [14]. In these settings, laboratory testing capacity was low, and critical care facilities were limited in the ability to provide adequate care for severe COVID-19 cases [15].

Despite Ethiopia’s limited laboratory testing and case management capacity, the early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions effectively delayed the peak of COVID-19 transmission. This delay provided critical time to expand testing capacity and prepare for severe cases, all without imposing strict lockdowns. Although the first COVID-19 case was reported in mid-March 2020, the peak was delayed for several months, occurring between late August and early September 2020 [10]. Similar experiences were reported in other countries. Robust point-of-entry measures, along with vigilant surveillance, social distancing, handwashing and case isolation [16], effectively delayed pandemic spread, buying time to scale up case management and laboratory services. Perhaps, the role of these interventions in infectious disease prevention and outbreak containment is well-established [17,18] and are foundational to primary health care systems today. This aligns with historical public health principles. Long before antibiotics were discovered, the germ theory transformed disease prevention, highlighting the importance of hygiene and quarantine measures, which were also key strategies in managing COVID-19.

Across all pillars, Ethiopia’s COVID-19 response leveraged public-private partnerships and collaboration with various sectors, civil society, donors, and international partners for resource mobilization, planning, and funding. Crucially, collaboration between the agricultural sector, higher learning institutions, and the health sector went beyond traditional boundaries, enabling shared resources and access to critical services. Notably, the health sector’s collaboration with universities and agricultural research institutions facilitated the rapid scaling up of laboratory testing, as PCR machines from these institutions were repurposed for COVID-19 testing. Furthermore, universities provided student facilities for quarantine and isolation, highlighting the significant role higher learning institutions played during the pandemic. The importance of multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder collaboration in health is well-documented and forms a core pillar of primary health care systems [19]. Furthermore, public-private partnerships are increasingly recognized for their role in health system development, as shared resources and collaborative efforts help secure essential supplies and foster innovation [20]. The private sector played a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s COVID-19 response, particularly by expanding access to laboratory testing, availing PPE, and other essential facilities, showcasing the important role the private sector can play in public health interventions.

In Ethiopia’s COVID-19 response, public figures played a role in strengthening community trust and promoting adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly physical and social distancing. The involvement of religious leaders and other prominent figures helped build community confidence during a time when misinformation and disinformation were widespread, encouraged broader public engagement, and supported compliance with response guidelines and protocols. Building trust and fostering effective public relations have long been recognized as essential for managing health emergencies and other public health interventions, particularly in primary health care systems [21–23]. Reflecting this, global primary health care guidelines emphasize community engagement, as highlighted in a recent WHO and UNICEF publication on the PHC operational framework [19]. Moreover, evidence shows that those countries effectively controlled COVID-19 without strict lockdowns partly relied on strong community trust, underscoring its critical role in disease prevention and outbreak response [16].

A key pillar of the COVID-19 response was the provision of essential supplies, including PPE and, later, vaccines. During the pandemic, scarcity of these items was a challenge. Shortages of these essential items were partly due to global supply chain disruptions and vaccine nationalism [24,25], and partly due to inefficient supply systems which are a characteristic of weak health systems [26]. Global supply disruptions were overcome by expanding local production capacity in Ethiopia.

The provision of essential medical supplies is recognized as a foundational pillar in both the WHO’s health system building blocks [27] and the primary health care framework [19]. The availability of such critical supplies is essential for the everyday resilience of health systems as well as in mitigating outbreaks. However, LMICs often face persistent gaps in these supplies. While insufficient financing is a contributing factor, inefficiencies in supply chains—particularly in last-mile delivery—pose significant challenges [26]. The global supply chain issues highlighted by COVID-19 emphasize the need to develop local capacity for producing essential medical supplies. By building local production capacity through public-private partnerships, the availability of essential supplies and self-sufficiency can be improved, contributing to stronger primary health care systems.

Manual data recording initially affected data quality, particularly for COVID-19 surveillance and data-driven decision-making in Ethiopia. However, collaborative efforts improved digitalization across the response, streamlining data for surveillance, laboratory testing, and case management. This rapid digital transformation highlighted the potential of digital health solutions in resource-limited settings and has implications for strengthening health systems. Together with previous initiatives, such as the Information Revolution Roadmap [28,29], this experience offers a valuable learning opportunity for the Ethiopian government to advance its health information systems.

Ethiopia has extensive experience in primary healthcare, largely centered on a community health program led by health extension workers. However, recent studies highlight challenges stemming from fragmentation within the program [30]. Launched in 2003, Ethiopia’s community health program was initially designed to empower communities and families in managing their own health, serving as an entry point into the health system [31]. Over time, this focus on community empowerment has diminished as shifting priorities diverted attention from this core objective, leading to fragmented efforts [30,32]. While Ethiopia’s National Health Sector Development Program (HSDP), implemented from the late 1990s to 2015, recognized the community health program led by health extension workers as a flagship component of the health system [30], it notably did not place significant emphasis on involving public figures and other informal community structures as part of its community engagement and trust-building strategy. Instead, community engagement was facilitated through the one-to-five network and the Health Development Army approaches [33], which were not explicitly utilized during the COVID-19 response.

The distinct role of community engagement and multi-sectoral action observed in Ethiopia’s initial COVID-19 response, particularly the involvement of public figures, underscores the value of adapting community engagement strategies for both primary health care and health security. While the Ministry of Health has recently taken steps to optimize the existing community health program [34], valuable lessons from the COVID-19 response remain to be fully integrated. Specifically, engaging communities through public figures and revitalizing multi-sectoral action enhances the implementation of health programs [35,36], builds public trust, and, when combined with other measures, supports the realization of strong primary health care systems.

The COVID-19 response offers other valuable opportunities for the primary health care system in Ethiopia to learn and grow. One key takeaway is the training provided to health workers across various aspects of the response, primarily through an online platform. This platform has established a legacy, serving as a resource for continuous professional development in Ethiopia’s health system. Furthermore, the over 3,000 RRTs deployed during the pandemic gained extensive experience in managing various outbreak response activities. If properly documented, these RRTs could be rapidly mobilized in the event of future emergencies, representing a significant asset for the development of the health workforce.

The other positive legacy of the COVID-19 response in Ethiopia includes significant developments in laboratory testing, critical care, and digitalization. The expansion of molecular laboratories and the establishment of viral genome sequencing capabilities enhance the country’s ability to detect and monitor diseases. In addition, the health system secured critical medical devices and deployed ultracold chain facilities nationwide. Combined with experiences in digitalization, these developments, if integrated into routine healthcare practices, could transform Ethiopia’s health system and ensure resilience.

Over the past decade and a half, Ethiopia’s health system strengthening efforts have focused on WHO’s six building blocks, while health security efforts have centered on IHR core capacities, often overlooking the role of health system strengthening in health security. An additional emphasis on primary health care—though widely recognized as integral to health system development—has further fragmented decision-making, policy, and resource allocation. Some policymakers emphasize health security, downplaying system strengthening, while others champion primary health care as central to health system development [37]. This divergence raises a key question when considering how to integrate COVID-19 response lessons into the broader health system: should these lessons be incorporated into health system strengthening via the six WHO building blocks, the IHR core capacities, primary health care pillars, or all these areas? To harness COVID-19 response lessons and strengthen health systems, Ethiopia needs an integrated, context-informed health system framework that reduces siloed approaches, as the WHO building blocks may not fully address health security needs. As Blanchet et al. noted, a health system’s resilience is its “capacity to absorb, adapt and transform when exposed to a shock such as a pandemic, natural disaster or armed conflict and still retain the same control over its structure and functions” [38]. Integrating lessons from the COVID-19 response into an adapted framework would enable Ethiopia’s health system to fulfill these characteristics and better mitigate future emergencies.

Our analysis showed that while Ethiopia attempted to integrate COVID-19 response experiences into its broader primary health care system for routine practice, the implementation of some of the recommended practices declined even before the pandemic ended. This decline highlights the need for leadership that prioritizes service integration into routine practices, as well as a unified framework to guide implementation and ensure resilience. Without such a framework, these lessons and experiences may not be fully sustained, as system level integration has not materialized, and decision making is fragmented. With fragmented decision-making, oversight and monitoring of these valuable lessons within the broader health system will be limited, hindering efforts to ensure everyday resilience.

There were a few limitations to this study. First, the health facilities selected for the sample were deliberately chosen from those designated as case management and isolation centers, with the purpose of obtaining comprehensive information about the response efforts. Consequently, the findings from these facilities may not fully represent all health facilities across the country. Second, the retrospective nature of the information sought may cause inaccurate recall, which could affect the study’s findings. Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights into COVID-19 response efforts, with data triangulated from multiple sources to enhance data quality and validity.

The Ethiopian health system gained valuable experiences and tools during the COVID-19 response, particularly in health workforce development, critical care, digital data solutions, cold chain systems, point of entry, laboratory testing, and community engagement. If these capacities are integrated and institutionalized into the broader health system—particularly within primary health care—and sustained, they have the potential to significantly strengthen the health system, enhance its resilience in daily operations, and provide a robust foundation for preventing and mitigating future risks. However, we observed a decline in some practices, particularly in surveillance, laboratory testing, and case management after the initial urgency waned. Our findings thus suggest that while COVID-19 investments expanded life-saving interventions, robust monitoring and follow-up mechanisms are essential to fully integrate and institutionalize many COVID-19 response platforms for future emergencies.
