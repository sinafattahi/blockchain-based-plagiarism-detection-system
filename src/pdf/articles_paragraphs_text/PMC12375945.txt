This review focuses on the use of the term inner strength (IS) in empirical studies in a health care context.

After database searches during the period 1990–2024, 64 articles were selected for summative content analysis.

The findings were divided into three groups: Group 1, studies where IS was stated in the aim; Group 2, where IS was not stated in the aim but described as a concept; and Group 3, where IS was used as a lay term. All articles in Group 1 described IS as ‘A connectedness grown in relationship’; several articles described it as ‘An internal powerful resource’, ‘A process of growth and transition’ and as ‘A positive view of life’. These four themes were also found in Group 2, but in this group, IS was also used to describe ‘A characteristic of self’ and ‘A courage to stand up for oneself’. The articles in Group 1 and Group 2 seemed to use IS as a cluster concept, that is, various descriptions might be aspects of a common phenomenon. In Group 3, IS was used as a lay term without further reflection on the meaning of the term.

The use of the term IS indicates that it is a cluster concept involving several aspects. Overall it is described as an important inner resource grown in connectedness with others and developed throughout life in a life worth living.

People survive, grow, mature, resist adversities and endure suffering. The ways they succeed vary according to life circumstances, personal capacities and other resources. Researchers have noticed the importance of people's inner resources often labelled resilience [1], sometimes internal strength and psychological strength [2]. Inner strength (IS) has been studied, for example, in psychology [3]; psychotherapy [4]; medicine [5]; theology [6] and in articles about spirituality and religion [7,8,9]. In nursing, the term IS was first mentioned by Rose [10], who described IS as a dynamic and complex phenomenon.

Two early attempts have been made to formulate a theory and a model of IS in nursing. (1) The Theory of Inner Strength (below referred to as the Theory) [11] based on empirical studies with women living with various chronic illnesses and a meta‐synthesis, which resulted in five constitutive patterns; Knowing and searching; Nurturing through connections; Dwelling in a different place by re‐creating the spirit within; Healing through movement in the present; Connecting with the future by living a new normal, where the essence of IS was described as ‘a central human resource that promotes well‐being’ (p. 86). (2) The Model of Inner Strength (below referred to as the Model) [12] started with study where the scales of Resilience, Sense of Coherence, Purpose in life and Self‐transcendence were used in a group of very old people to detect their perceived physical and mental health [13]. The scores of the scales correlated and seemed to share a common ‘area’ that the authors termed IS [12]. The Model was developed based on the meta‐theoretical analysis of the concepts assessed by the scales and the concept of hardiness [14]. The Model describes IS as being composed of four interrelated dimensions of Connectedness, Firmness, Flexibility and Creativity [12]. In a later publication the term flexibility was changed to Stretchability [15]. These early conceptualizations may have had some influence on the meaning of IS in nursing research. In both paradigms measures have been published: the Inner Strength Questionnaire (ISQ) [16,17] and the Inner Strength Scale (ISS) [18].

Jenkinson and Cantrell [19] reviewed 10 articles about women with chronic illnesses that were connected to the Theory by Roux et al. [11]. They concluded that there are gaps in knowledge of IS. A review of 17 articles described IS as a personal resource and the importance of relationships [20]. Morgan [21] reviewed articles about IS in people ageing with serious illnesses and emphasised the importance of memories of relationships in the past, in the present and expectation for the future. As sometimes the term IS was used with various meanings, we decided to focus our review on how it was used in articles.

Words have both a denotational and a connotational meaning or a reference and a sense [22,23]. The difference between the two kinds of meaning is exemplified when for people the word ‘dog’ can denote the same animal, but the connotative meaning may be different; dogs may be seen as lovely and friendly, or as dirty and dangerous. Words may get different meanings in different contexts.

Words or terms stand for various phenomena; some stand for concepts. The process of building concepts sometimes starts with the analysis of observations. If researchers do not find a concept that fits the observations, they may label the observed phenomenon with a new term. A concept must be linked to data, and a term must signify something that can be defined or exemplified [24]. Scientific concepts need precision, such as definition or description. People may use everyday concepts and terms without special clarification. One term can have a multiplicity of meanings and nuances [24,25] sometimes there is one term for two differing concepts [26], such as the word frailty in oncology and geriatrics. Different terms can be used for the same concept, such as the word depression [27].

To produce evidence‐based knowledge it is important to clarify the use of terms and thus to formulate mature concepts [28,29]. To become a mature scientific concept, some consensus among researchers about the meaning of the concept is needed, manifested when referring to previous studies.

This review focuses on the use of the term IS in health care articles 1990–2024. We check whether authors use the term IS as a lay term or use the term to label scientific concepts [30] and if they refer to previous research on IS. The aim of our study was to describe the use of the term IS in articles with qualitative design in a healthcare context that had the term IS in the findings.

Database searches were performed in Cinahl, Medline, Pubmed and Scopus during the period 1990–2024. IS was used as a search term in abstracts, titles and keywords in peer‐reviewed journals published in English. Inclusion criteria were articles about empirical studies with a qualitative design in a health context that had IS in the findings.

The search resulted in 235 articles; a further 15 articles were found in the authors' own files. After the removal of duplications, 250 abstracts were selected. After the review of the abstracts, 121 articles were excluded and after reading the articles, a further 63 were excluded as they did not fit our inclusion criteria, resulting in 66 articles to be analysed. None of the included 66 articles were judged to have major shortcomings regarding trustworthiness [31].

We discussed the articles and divided them into three groups: Group 1: articles where exploring IS was stated in the aim, Group 2: articles where IS was not stated in the aim but seemed to be used as a concept in the description of the results and Group 3: articles where IS seemed to be used as a lay term in the results as it did not describe any further content of IS.

Characteristics of the participants and included articles of the total sample are shown in Table1. Examples of the participants' described health conditions were chronic illness, cancer, HIV, cardiovascular diseases or healthy. Some participated as family members or healthcare personnel.

Participants, analysis methods, continents where the data collection took place and areas for journals.

The analysis was inspired by the description of summative content analysis. A summative content analysis involves comparisons and counting, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context [32]. We analysed the articles from the three groups separately. In each group, we identified descriptions of IS in findings and extracted these descriptions. In Groups 1 and 2, we compared the descriptions and sorted them based on similarities and formulated themes. Then we checked how many articles contributed content to each theme in order to deepen the understanding of the use of the term inner strength. In Tables2and3we present an overview of the result. From Group 3, only examples are given in the findings as IS was used without further reflection on the meaning of the term.

Themes of Inner Strength in articles with qualitative inductive method and inner strength in the aim,n= 9.

Themes of Inner Strength in articles without inner strength in the aim,n= 27.

First, we present findings from the 14 studies where the term IS was stated in the aim of the study (Group 1). Of these, nine studies had an inductive approach and five had a deductive approach. Of these, three studies used the Theory, and two studies used the Model for analysis. Thereafter, we present findings from 27 studies where IS was not stated in the aim but was used as a concept (Group 2). Finally, examples of the 25 studies where IS was used as a lay term are presented (Group 3).

Descriptions of IS in studies where the term IS was stated in the aim were analysed inductively. This part includes narrated experiences and thoughts of what IS is. Four themes of IS were constructed:A connectedness grown in relationships;An internal powerful resource;A process of growth and transition;A positive view of life.

All articles described IS as aconnectedness grown in relationshipsincluding to feel connected to others [10], to have faith in and be supported by others [37], to draw from nourishing encounters [64], from mutual love and support from family [33] from friends [38,39], from others [34,35], from God [36,38,39], from being part of a greater whole [37] and from being in a balanced harmonious interaction with the environment [38], with animals and nature [37] and being seen as a person by health care personnel [33].

Seven articles described IS asan internal powerful resourceincluding, to know one's purpose [35], to be self‐aware and true to oneself, to experience one's capacity [10,37], to know one's strength [64], to embrace vulnerability, to be quiet and calm [10], to use one's humour [10], to be resourceful, stubborn and wilful [36], to have a strong, positive, playful spirit [38] and to face and take an active part in one's own care and treatment [39]. IS was described as endurance when you must be strong [36] and as a phenomenon that fosters well‐being and healing during illness and hardship [35]. Knowing what you are and what you stand for, feeling competent in yourself yet having faith in others [37], knowing that your decision is right and being able ‘to get on with it’ were described. IS was also seen as a transcendental force within oneself [36].

Seven articles described IS asa process of growth and transitionincluding to strive to balance and assimilate new understandings, meanings and directions in life [34], to understand the whole of situations and the complex reality [10], to confront reality and pick oneself up again [39], to fight for the desire to go on living [36,38], to be the same yet grow into a new garment [37], to have an ability to balance the past, present and future [35,37], to draw strength from past experiences and what one has managed before [35,39] and to envision an active, healthy and strong life in the future [34,36].

Three articles described IS as apositive view of life, including focusing on possibilities [35,37] and having the ability to look on the bright side of life [36,37]. An overview of the themes is shown in Table2.

Koob et al. [65] reported a hermeneutic study about women with multiple sclerosis. The findings validated the Theory [11] and the authors added to the constitutive patterns. Dwelling in a different place by re‐creating the spirit within the theme Being abused—knowing that it hurts. The authors explained that the person becomes stronger by accepting the suffering.

Analysing their previous ethnographic article about health beliefs and practices in rural El Salvador during a period with challenging events [66], Rutherford and Parker [67] found similarities between women's described lifeways and the six defining attributes of IS described in the concept analysis by Dingley et al. [68].

Mendes & Roux [69] performed a grounded theory study based on the Theory [11] about factors related to IS in women during their recovery from coronary stent placement. They describedliving a new normalas a basic psychosocial process used when resolving conflicts caused by changing patterns of fear that occurred in 5 stages: uncertainty in seeking help, rapid changing, evolving patterns, reminiscing the past and spiritual solace.

Two studies where deductive analyses based on the four dimensions Connectedness, Firmness, Flexibility and Creativity of the Model [12] in relation to health were reported. Content analyses of narrated experiences among older women [70] and among middle‐aged men and women [15] were explored. One conclusion from both studies was that the Model was applicable and that the four dimensions could be identified in the narratives, but the wordings of the expressions and hence the themes varied between the studies. Another conclusion was that IS was seen as a health resource for both older women and middle‐aged men and women.

Descriptions of IS from articles where IS was not stated in the aim of the study but used as a concept are presented below. Six themes of IS were identified:A positive view of life;A characteristic of self;A connectedness grown in relationships;An internal powerful resource;A courage to stand up for oneself; andA process of growth and transition.

In 20 articles IS was described as ‘A positive view of life’, including an ability to focus on positive attributes in a world of diminishing prospects [44,45,47] a will to live [59] perceiving the many‐sidedness of life with forbearance [52] and a gratitude for all that life offers, including challenges [71].

IS was also described as being optimistic [40,47], staying positive and focusing on positive changes [48], reframing negative events as positive for oneself and for others, and finding a new normal [60], keeping a positive attitude [51,58] being positive and getting through each day [72], having positive thinking [41,50,53,57] enjoying and valuing good moments in everyday life, not taking life for granted, making small changes in everyday life and distracting from difficult thoughts [61], enjoying the small things in life [49], making the best of the situation [43] and having the ability to deliberately block negative thoughts and never give up [57,73].

In 12 articles IS was described asA characteristic of self. It was described as: a personal quality [55], an intrinsic character trait [62], having a strong belief in oneself [71], increasing self‐determination [60], reaching one's full potential in life [71], being self‐reliant and self‐aware [41], having self‐control [49,50], having a sense of humour [47,48,51], setting attainable goals [51] and having an attitude that one can do most things [72].

In eight articles IS was described as ‘A connectedness grown in relationships’ including meaningful connectedness with others [54,63], asking for help in difficult situations [42], receiving support and comfort from others and helping others [46] feeling involved and belonging, being a significant link in an important context [49] and being a provider for the family [56]. It was also described as having a spirituality [54,59], and having a strong connection to a higher power [40,46] and believing in self and God [72].

In five articles IS was described as ‘An internal powerful resource’, including an inner capacity [58], a resource not earlier known but discovered [42,51], having capabilities such as overcoming anxieties about death and continuing to live [59], promoting wellbeing [52] and, becoming a stronger person through burden of illness [46].

In four articles IS was described as ‘A courage to stand up for oneself’, including having courage to fight adverse events [41], courage to stand up for oneself [40,46] and courage to trust in own potential and body [53].

In two articles IS was described as ‘A process of growth and transition’ including developing through crises and adversities and as a process of moving towards a new normal [60] and transforming thinking and initiating a new approach to life [61]. An overview of the themes is shown in Table3.

IS as a lay term was used to describe various aspects of internal resources, as the discovery of an unexpected inner force [74], a developmental process towards increased maturity [75]. In some articles there was no description of what IS is, but rather descriptions of the sources that enhanced IS, for example believing in God [76] and interacting with others [77]. IS was also described as being something that emerges when living with a chronic illness [78], and some persons described it as needed but not being found [79]. In some articles, the term IS only appeared as a theme/category, or as a part of a theme [80]. Sometimes the term appeared only in a quote [81].

The aim of our study was to describe the use of the term IS in articles with qualitative design in a healthcare context that had the term IS in the findings.

The articles were mostly produced in Western societies and more than half of them were found in nursing journals. Both articles in Groups 1 and 2 used the term IS to describe:A connectedness grown in relationships;An internal powerful resource;A process of growth and transition;A positive view on life. These similarities strengthen that IS consists of these important aspects: an important inner resource, developed throughout life and grown in relations in a meaningful life.

In articles in Group 2, the term IS was also used to describe:A characteristic of selfandA courage to stand up for oneself. These aspects describe expressions of personal capabilities/abilities [50,71] and having courage to stand up for oneself [40,46]. The differences shown between Groups 1 and 2 could be related to the fact that the authors that had IS in their research aims (Group 1) were more acquainted with previous research about IS than the group without that aim (Group 2). Only seven articles out of 27 in Group 2 referred to the Theory or to the Model. Therefore, it seems logical that the researchers' expressions in Group 2 were more heterogeneous and resulted in additional terms/aspects related to the concept of IS. The researchers probably were less influenced by theoretical terms and therefore more open to everyday expressions. Thus, a conclusion is that the early Theory and Model have had some impact on the development of the meaning of IS in nursing.

In 3 articles [65,67,69] the analyses were based on the Theory. Various analyses methods were used, and the authors concluded that their results validated the Theory. The Model was used for deductive analysis of narratives from one group of old women [70] and from one group of middle‐aged men and women [15]. The authors found that it was possible to identify the dimensions of IS in both groups, and that the expressions of IS seemed context dependent, for example related to age and living conditions. Both the Theory and the Model have a nursing perspective and focus on the importance of people's inner resources for well‐being, particularly in relation to living with or recovering from illnesses. They also deem that it is possible to promote and weaken IS. Both conceptualisations also emphasise the importance of relationships with others and the environment in general, for the development and preservation of IS. Some kind of transcendence is also described in both conceptualisations, but perhaps something more obvious in the Theory. The relationship with religion, spirituality and metaphysics is mentioned/emphasised in the Theory, but not in the Model, which contains more drive, purposefulness and flexibility/stretchability.

A salient result of our analysis was that the term IS was in 25 of 66 articles (Group 3) used without further reflection on the meaning of the term or on the context in which it was used. IS was occasionally used to describe, for example, an unexpected force that was found in hardship or sources of what enhanced IS. We understand this as indicating that IS was used as a lay term [30], maybe regarded as something that goes without saying.

Many attempts have been published about the importance to define concepts and find appropriate terms to label them [25,82,83]. We only analysed articles with the term IS in the finding and did not consider articles where words such as inner power, resilience, willpower, empowerments or only strength were used. Kotarba et al. [84] aimed at integrating the nursing concept of IS with ideas from the sociological concept of existential self. Based on interviews with women living with HIV/AIDS, they wrote IS refers to the different ways women with serious illnesses experience and subsequently talk about the deepest, existential resources available to and used by them to manage severe threats to body and self (p. 88).

Concepts can be regarded as inter‐subjective social constructs that gain meaning in conversations [85]. As concepts have ontological and epistemological foundations, they are linked to different ways of understanding life [86,87]. When we identified various aspects of phenomena or concepts labelled IS we considered that the various descriptions might be aspects of common phenomena, that is, cluster concepts [88]. Our analyses of articles where the term IS was included showed that the term was used to label IS as a cluster concept in Groups 1 and 2.

There is always a risk for selection bias in reviews. In this study we searched in the most common databases for nursing, and we consider that we have articles of interest for our aim. None of the included articles were judged to have major shortcomings regarding trustworthiness [31].

For achieving trustworthiness of the findings, the selected articles have been systematically checked and the interpretations have been confirmed among the authors.

We chose to analyse the articles in separate groups, that is, articles with or without the term IS in the aim. These separate analyses enabled us to detect both similarities and differences.

Most participants in the analysed studies were women, which can depend on researchers' intent to especially focus on research visualising women's experiences of how they manage life during exceptional circumstances. One of the research groups in the field of IS has solely women as their target group, for example, [35]. Our review shows a small amount of research on men's IS. More research on men is needed to make comparisons between genders possible.

All articles in Group 1 and some in Group 2 seemed to use IS as a cluster concept and have at least some understanding of research on IS, while other articles (Group 3) showed no knowledge of research on IS and treated the term as a lay term.

Our understanding points to the fact that the cluster concept of IS involves several aspects. Overall it is described as an inner resource grown in connectedness with others in a life that is viewed as worth living. IS develops throughout life.
