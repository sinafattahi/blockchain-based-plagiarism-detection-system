The complete mitochondrial genome ofPennisetum giganteum, an African species, was sequenced and characterized for the first time. The genome is 491,311 bp long and contains 53 unique genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on these genes using maximum likelihood revealed thatP. giganteumis most closely related to Saccharum officinarum and most distantly related toOryza sativa. This study provides essential genomic data that enhances the understanding of the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of this versatile and high-yielding species.

Pennisetum giganteumA. Rich. (Poaceae) is a perennial C4grass native to Africa, widely distributed in tropical to subtropical regions due to its adaptability to warm climates (Fulkerson et al.2007; Xing et al.2023). As a member of the genusPennisetum,P. giganteumhas significant ecological and agricultural value, noted for rapid growth, high biomass yield, and applications in sustainable agriculture (Samson et al.2005; Hayat et al.2020). However, genomic resources forP. giganteumremain scarce, particularly for organellar genomes. While chloroplast data exist for close relatives likePennisetum glaucum(Xu et al.2019), no mitochondrial genome has been reported for anyPennisetumspecies (Zheng et al.2023).

Mitochondrial genomes are pivotal for resolving plant phylogenies due to structural complexity and variable evolutionary rates (Zardoya2020). InPennisetum, taxonomic relationships are complicated by hybridization and polyploidization (Dos Reis et al.2014; Xing et al.2023). Although nuclear and chloroplast markers have been used (Xu et al.2019; Zheng et al.2023), mitochondrial data are critical for evolutionary insights (Shearman et al.2016; Wu et al.2022). Here, we present the first complete mitochondrial genome ofP. giganteum, assembled using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing. This work addresses a genomic gap and provides foundational data for studies on mitochondrial evolution, C4photosynthesis (Fan et al.2022), and phylogenetics in this key genus.

TheP. giganteumwas used in this study. The voucher specimen was identified by researchers and deposited at the Herbarium of Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China, under voucher number XM-W145 (contact: Zhengang Ru;rzgh5819@163.com). Fresh roots ofP. giganteumwere collected from the Botanical Garden of the Wheat Research Center, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, China (113°52′E, 35°30′N) by Man Zhang (Figure 1).

The photos ofPennisetum giganteumwere taken by Man Zhang at the Botanical Garden of the Center of Wheat Research of Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, Henan, China.

A genomic DNA sample was isolated from the roots with a Plant Tissue Mitochondrial DNA Extraction Kit (Genmed Scientific Inc., Arlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and quality control was subsequently carried out on the purified DNA samples. The quality of DNA was assessed using Qubit3.0 and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Highly qualified DNA sample (OD260/280 = 1.8 ∼ 2.0, >6ug) was utilized to construct the fragment library.

To obtain full-length mitochondrial genome sequences, we used both short-read (Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform) and long-read sequencing (Nanopore sequencing platform) technologies in this study. The raw paired-end reads were trimmed and quality controlled by Trimmomatic with parameters (SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:75) (Bolger et al.2014). Clean data obtained through the above quality control processes was used for further analysis.

The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 short reads (6.3 Gb) were used to evaluate the complexity of the genome and correct the Nanopore long reads. First, we used ABySS 2.2.0 (Simpson et al.2009) to perform genome assembly with multiple-kmer parameters and received the optimal results of the assembly. Secondly, blasR (Chaisson and Tesler2012) was used to map the preliminary assembly results to the Nanopore long reads (6.3 Gb). Then, SPAdes-3.15.5 (Prjibelski et al.2020) was used to assemble them (Nanopore and NGS data) together to construct contigs (Scaffolds). Finally, GapCloser v1.12 (Xu et al.2020) software was applied to fill the remaining local inner gaps and correct the single-base polymorphism for the final assembly results.

The mitochondrial genes were annotated through homology alignments and de novo prediction. Gene prediction for tRNAs was performed using tRNAscan-SE 2.0.4 (Chan and Lowe2019) with default parameters. For rRNA and protein-coding genes (PCGs), the assembled mitochondrial genome ofP. giganteum(query) was aligned against the complete mitochondrial genome ofSaccharum officinarum(reference database; GenBank:LC107874)viaBLASTn (BLAST + 2.9.0; Camacho et al.2009). Homologous regions meeting thresholds of ≥80% sequence identity and ≥90% coverage were retained, and gene boundaries were further refined using ORFfinder (v0.4.1; Sayers et al.2024).

Finally, the circular mitochondrial genome assembly and split gene identification were performed and validated using the Plant Mitochondrial Genomes Map (PMGmap) v2.0 (Zhang et al.2024), a tool specialized in structural annotation based on sequence conservation and break-join modeling.

The annotated mitogenome was submitted to the GenBank database under accession numberPQ768538. Then all gene models were analyzed by BLASTp (Camacho et al.2009) against the non-redundant (NR) protein database (Sayers et al.2024), SwissProt (The UniProt Consortium2019), KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto2000), Gene Ontology (GO) (The Gene Ontology Consortium2000), and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) (Tatusov et al.2000) for functional annotation.

To validate the assembly completeness and uniformity, sequencing reads were mapped back to the mitochondrial genome using BWA-MEM v0.7.17 (Li2013) with default parameters. The coverage depth across the genome was calculated using SAMtools v1.18 (Danecek et al.2021) and visualized as a coverage plot (Figure S1)viathe Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.19.1 (Thorvaldsdóttir et al.2013). The average coverage depth of 284.04× indicates sufficient sequencing depth to ensure high-confidence assembly and highlights uniform read distribution, which minimizes potential gaps or misassemblies (Figure S1). Coverage analysis also helps identify repetitive regions or structural variations that may challenge assembly algorithms.

To determine the molecular position ofP. giganteumwith other closely related species, phylogenetic analyses were performed using 11 complete mitochondrial genome sequences (comprising 34 PCGs, 16 tRNAs, and three rRNAs). First, global alignment was conducted with MUMmer v3.23 (Delcher et al.2002) to identify syntenic blocks. Local alignment refinement was performed using BLAT v36 (Kent2002) with default parameters. To ensure alignment quality, ambiguous and divergent regions were filtered using Gblocks v0.91b (Castresana2000) under strict parameters (-t = d -b4 = 5 -b5 = h), retaining only highly conserved blocks suitable for phylogenetic inference. The best-fit nucleotide substitution model (GTR+I + G) was selected using jModelTest 2.1.10 (Darriba et al.2012), and maximum-likelihood trees were constructed with PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al.2010) using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.Oryza sativaJaponica Group (accessionBA000029.3) was selected as the outgroup, as its placement in the evolutionarily distinct Oryzoideae subfamily provides a robust phylogenetic contrast to the Panicoideae subfamily (containingPennisetum), and its well-annotated mitochondrial genome is widely adopted in Poaceae studies.

The assembled mitochondrial genome (491,311 bp; GenBank ID:PQ768538) contains 34 protein-coding genes, 16 tRNA genes, and 3 rRNA genes. This circular map displays the following features from the innermost to the outermost ring: Relationships between dispersed repeats; Distribution of dispersed repeats along the genome (direct repeats shown in yellow, inverted repeats in green).

TheP. giganteummitochondrial genome (GenBank ID:PQ768538) was assembled into a single, circular sequence with a length of 491,311 bp and a GC content of 43.81%.

The mitochondrial genome ofP. giganteumincludes 34 PCGs, 16 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes (Figure 2,Table S1). Most of the PCGs have an ATG start codon, except for nad1 and nad4L, which have an ACG start codon. There are two types of termination codons in the PCGs: TAA and TAG, which correspond to 15 and 19 genes, respectively. Among the PCGs, eight werecis-spliced genes, six of which contained one intron (ccmFc,cox2,rpl2,rps3,trnD-GUC,trnF-GAA), one contained three introns (nad4), and one contained four introns (nad7).nad1,nad2, andnad5weretrans-spliced genes, all of which contained four introns (Figure S2).

The 16 tRNAs ranged from 68 to 89 bp in length.rrn5,rrnL, andrrnSgenes were 120 bp, 3535 bp, and 1967 bp in length, respectively. There were 17 gene duplications, including 9 PCGs, five tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes.

The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed using the complete mitochondrial genome of 11 species. The following sequences were used:Pennisetum giganteum(GenBank:PQ768538),Oryza sativaJaponica Group (GenBank:BA000029.3; Notsu et al.2002),Hordeum vulgare(GenBank:MN127974),Triticum aestivum(GenBank:AP008982; Ogihara et al.2005),Aegilops speltoides(GenBank:AP013107),Thinopyrum obtusiflorum(GenBank:OK120846; Wu et al.2022),Elymus magellanicus(GenBank:OQ086977; Chen et al.2023),Zea maysvoucher SUMG 004 (GenBank:OP832499),Zea maysvoucher SUMG 005 (GenBank:OP832500),Tripsacum dactyloides(GenBank:DQ984517),Saccharum officinarum(GenBank:LC107874; Shearman et al.2016). The phylogenetic tree was rooted with the outgroup (Oryzasativa), with branch lengths scaled to substitutions per site. Numbers next to each node indicate bootstrap support values.

Compared to animal mitochondria, plant mitochondrial genomes exhibit greater structural complexity and variability. Consequently, research has predominantly focused on chloroplasts, leaving many plant mitochondrial genomes unresolved (Zardoya2020). This study presents the first complete assembly and annotation of the mitochondrial genome ofP. giganteum, marking the first reported mitochondrial genome for any species within the genusPennisetum.

The assembly and annotation of theP. giganteummitochondrial genome (491,311 bp) provide critical insights into its genomic architecture. Its moderate GC content (43.81%) aligns closely with mitochondrial genomes of other Poaceae species, such asS. officinarum(43.9%) andZea mays(43.9%), suggesting conserved compositional stability among C4grasses (Clifton et al.2004; Xing et al.2023; Li et al.2025). Notably, the presence of atypical start codons (e.g. ACG fornad1) mirrors findings inElymus magellanicus(Chen et al.2023) andSaccharumspecies (Zhou et al.2022), highlighting potential evolutionary constraints in mitochondrial gene regulation.

Mitochondrial PCGs exhibit significantly slower evolutionary rates, particularly in synonymous substitutions (Wu et al.2020). This high conservation makes them suitable for resolving deep-level phylogenetic relationships, contrasting with chloroplast genomes better suited for lower taxonomic ranks (Lan et al.2024).

The coexistence ofcis-spliced andtrans-spliced genes underscores intricate RNA processing inP. giganteum, aligning with mitochondrial genome plasticity observed in other polyploid grasses (Guo et al.2020). This characterization provides foundational insights into its potential role in supporting C4photosynthetic evolution.

Phylogenetic analysis revealedP. giganteum’s closest relationship withS. officinarum(a C4grass), consistent with morphological and ecological similarities, while showing marked divergence from C3species likeO. sativa. This mitochondrial genome serves as a crucial reference for resolving taxonomic uncertainties, studying polyploid mitochondrial evolution, and developing molecular markers. These findings establish a foundation for future investigations into C4plant mitochondrial-chloroplast interactions and stress tolerance genetics. Integrating mitogenomic data with nuclear and chloroplast genomes will enhance understanding of adaptive evolution in this genus.
