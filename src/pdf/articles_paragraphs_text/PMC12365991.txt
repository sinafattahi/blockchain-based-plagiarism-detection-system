The aim of this study was to investigate changes that may occur in the peripheral vestibular system due to inner ear barotrauma in self‐contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) divers exposed to hyperbaric environments.

This prospective study was conducted on 45 healthy volunteers. In this study, after otologic and audiological examinations were performed on two groups as control (n= 24) and SCUBA (n= 21), cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c‐VEMP) were evaluated for peripheral vestibular system functions. The SCUBA group comprised individuals who had completed a minimum of 75 dives and held a World Confederation of Underwater Activities 2 certificate. Statistical analysis was performed on immittance metric measurements, pure‐tone hearing thresholds (0.5–18 kHz), and P1‐N1 latencies and amplitudes from c‐VEMP tests.

The SCUBA group demonstrated statistically significant differences in pure‐tone low and high frequency thresholds within the normal hearing range compared to the control group (p= 0.001). The c‐VEMP responses showed statistically significant prolongation of P1‐N1 latencies in right ears and N1 latencies in left ears in the SCUBA group (p< 0.05), along with a statistically significant increase in amplitudes (p= 0.0001).

Based on our findings, the increased amplitudes in c‐VEMP responses observed in SCUBA divers exposed to hyperbaric environments suggest enhanced saccular plasticity, likely resulting from barotrauma effects on otolith structures.

This study investigates changes that may occur in the peripheral vestibular system due to inner ear barotrauma in self‐contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) divers exposed to hyperbaric environments. Our findings demonstrate that the significant increase in c‐VEMP response amplitudes among SCUBA divers exposed to hyperbaric environments suggests enhanced saccular plasticity resulting from effects on otolithic structures.

Under normal surface conditions, a state of equilibrium exists between the atmospheric pressure and the air pressure within the body's air‐filled spaces. However, during activities such as scuba diving, this balance is disrupted. The ambient water pressure increases significantly with descent, while the air pressure inside the diver's body cavities, such as the middle ears, sinuses, and lungs, must be actively equalized to match this change [1]. Self‐Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) divers are particularly exposed to these dramatic fluctuations in environmental pressure. As of 2025, the global number of certified scuba divers has surpassed 30 million [2]. While scuba diving is a popular recreational activity, failure to properly manage the pressure differences between the water and the body's air spaces can lead to a type of injury known as barotrauma. This can cause damage to various organ systems, most commonly affecting the ears, sinuses, and, in severe cases, the lungs [3].

Diving‐related disorders commonly include hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, unsteadiness, and dizziness [4,5]. In hyperbaric environments, three main pathological conditions affect the inner ear: inner ear barotrauma (IEB), inner ear decompression sickness (IEDS), and alternobaric vertigo (ABV) [3,4,6]. Inner ear barotrauma results from inadequate equalization of middle ear pressure, leading to inner ear degeneration [3,4]. IEDS is characterized by the formation of gas bubbles in the inner ear vessels during rapid ascent [4]. ABV typically develops when going up or performing the Valsalva maneuver. ABV is a benign condition caused by an imbalance between middle ear pressures, causing a difference in perception in the vestibular system [3,6].

Human balance relies on three fundamental sensory systems: vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive [7]. The vestibular system, which operates in coordination with visual and proprioceptive systems, comprises peripheral and central components [8]. The peripheral sensory structures of the vestibular system include the semicircular canals and the otolith organs (utricle and saccule). Information from these peripheral structures is transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) to the vestibular nuclei in the lower brainstem. This information is subsequently relayed to the cerebellum and cortex for complete processing [7,8].

Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) provide an objective method for evaluating otolith structures and vestibular reflexes [9]. The clinical assessment of vestibular injuries, such as those caused by barotrauma, relies on objective measures of inner ear function. Such pressure‐induced injuries can lead to a range of vestibular symptoms, including vertigo and hearing loss, by damaging delicate structures like the round and oval windows, potentially causing a perilymph fistula [3,4,6,10,11]. To evaluate the integrity of specific parts of the vestibular system after such trauma, clinicians can use cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c‐VEMP) [12,13,14]. This neurophysiological test provides a functional assessment of the saccule and its afferent pathway, the inferior vestibular nerve, by measuring a reflex response in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) [15,16]. Studies have shown that c‐VEMP testing can identify abnormalities in saccular function, and while not specific to barotrauma, it serves as a valuable tool in the diagnostic workup of patients presenting with vestibular complaints post‐diving, helping to localize the site of injury within the vestibular apparatus [12,13,17]. While scuba diving frequently report vestibular symptoms following hyperbaric exposure depend on IEB, these subjective complaints often lack corresponding objective evidence that can localize and quantify the underlying physiological damage. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to use cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c‐VEMP) to objectively evaluate the integrity of the peripheral vestibular system in divers, thereby determining the extent of vestibular damage resulting from barotrauma in hyperbaric environments.

This investigation was conducted at the Trakya University Medicine Faculty, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Audiology Unit between December 2023 and February 2024, following ethics committee approval (Ethic Number: TUTF‐GOBAEK 2022/394; December 16, 2022) and obtaining written informed consent from all participants.

Otorhinolaryngology specialists obtained a comprehensive medical history from each participant. This history included a detailed account of their diving experience (e.g., years certified, total number of dives, typical dive depths), any history of otologic or vestibular symptoms such as vertigo, hearing loss, or tinnitus, previous ear surgeries, and any relevant comorbidities. Following this detailed history‐taking, a complete otoscopic examination was performed on all subjects. Comprehensive hearing and balance examinations were followed by audiological and vestibular assessments by an audiologist. Power analysis was performed using G‐Power software (version 3.1.9.7), bivariate normal model based on Pearson correlation analysis. A required sample size of 42 was calculated for a two‐tailed test, based on the ability to detect a large effect size (r= 0.41) with a desired power (1‐β) of 80% at a significance level (α) of 0.05. The study ultimately included 45 young adults aged 18–45 years, satisfying the calculated sample size requirement.

Inclusion criteria (The SCUBA group) comprised age between 18 and 45 years, normal hearing, diving experience to depths of at least 20 m, individuals who had completed a minimum of 75 dives and held a World Confederation of Underwater Activities 2 certificate (Persons who have previously received a 1 Star badge, have completed at least 20 experience dives, have open water diving experience, can dive to a maximum depth of 30 m and can do night diving), a minimum of 5 years of SCUBA diving experience, and no diving activity within the previous 3 days. Inclusion criteria (Control group) comprised age between 18 and 45 years, normal hearing, and not having diving experience. In both groups, the Amplitude Asymmetry Ratio in the c‐VEMP test was required to be not less than 0.35. Exclusion criteria included (The SCUBA and Control groups): history of dizziness and/or balance disorders, orthopedic or neurological conditions, middle ear pathologies, cervical problems, or use of vestibular suppressant medications that could potentially affect c‐VEMP test results.

Within the scope of immitanc evaluation, “Interacoustics AT23” Tympanometer (Taastrup Denmark) device and TDH‐39 (Telephonics, USA) headphones were used for tympanometry and acoustic reflex measurements. The test was started by placing a probe at the entrance of the external ear canal. The test was performed at 75 dB SPL with a 226 Hz probe tone. The ipsilateral acoustic reflex threshold was evaluated in the range of 500–4000 Hz. The peak curve in the pressure range of +100 and −50 daPa was evaluated as a normal tympanogram with a compliance value between 0.39 and 1.69 mL as “Type A,” and these individuals were included in the study [18].

Audiological evaluation was performed in a standard soundproof booth according to ANSI standards, following audiologic evaluation procedures. Air conduction (0.5‐ 18 kHz) and bone conduction (0.5–4 kHz) hearing thresholds were assessed using the Interacoustics AC40 Clinical Audiometer (Denmark). Thresholds were determined using the Hugoson‐Westlake procedure [19]. Telephonic TDH‐39 (Telephonics, USA) supra‐aural headphones were used to determine the air conduction threshold, and B‐71 (Radioear, USA) bone vibrator was used to determine the bone conduction threshold. Pure tone average was calculated by the arithmetic average of air conduction hearing thresholds at four frequencies (0.5–4 kHz), and individuals with a pure tone average of 25 dB and below were considered to have normal hearing [20]. Individuals with bilateral hearing of 25 dB and below were included in the study. High frequency thresholds were evaluated between 8 kHz and 18 kHz.

Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials test battery was performed using the c‐VEMP module of the Eclipse EP 25 Evoked Potentials (Interacoustics‐Denmark). Since the SCM muscle should remain contracted during the test, the participants were asked to turn their heads in the opposite direction of the tested side during the test period. Then, the ground electrode was placed on the forehead, the reference electrodes were placed on the middle 1/3 of the SCM muscle on both sides, and the active electrode was placed on the sternum bone. Care was taken to ensure that the impedance values of the electrodes were in the range of 0–5 kΩ. During the test, a 500 Hz Tone Burst stimulus, rarefaction polarity, 5.1 Hz stimulation frequency, and 95 dB SPL sound was sent to the participant using insert headphones. Recording was performed with 200 sweeps and taking two traces for both ears. The recording was made from the SCM muscle on the ipsilateral side of the ear to which the signal was sent, and the electromyography (EMG) value was accepted in the range of 45–95 μV [15]. P1‐N1 latencies and amplitudes were evaluated by calling the first positive wave P1 and the first negative wave N1. In healthy subjects with an Amplitude Asymmetry Ratio (AAR) less than 0.35, the reliability of the results was optimized by considering the difference between right and left side SCM contractions to be less than 20 μV [21].

Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The selection of appropriate statistical tests was determined by the distribution characteristics of the data. Specifically, the Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the distribution for all continuous variables. For data that followed a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk testp> 0.05), Independent Samplest‐tests were applied for group comparisons. Conversely, for data that did not follow a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilkp< 0.05), the non‐parametric Mann–WhitneyUtest was employed. Descriptive statistics are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed variables, median (minimum‐maximum) for non‐normally distributed variables, and as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Relationships between numerical variables were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients, with a Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. Ap‐value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In addition to group‐level comparisons, an individual analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of abnormal findings. Each participant's c‐VEMP results were compared against established clinical cut‐off values. Based on foundational literature, P1/N1‐amplitudes, an AAR greater than 35% and/or P1/N1 latencies exceeding means + 2 SD from the normative mean were classified as abnormal [21,22,23,24].

The SCUBA group comprised 15 males (71.5%) and 6 females (28.5%), while the control group consisted of 14 males (58.3%) and 10 females (41.7%). The mean diving duration was 7 ± 2.14 years in the SCUBA group. The mean age was 29.45 ± 5.78 years for the SCUBA group and 26.80 ± 2.63 years for the control group.

Bilateral Type A tympanograms and stapedial reflex thresholds were obtained from all study participants. Audiological evaluation revealed statistically significant elevations in both pure‐tone averages (0.5–4 kHz)—while within normal hearing limits—and high‐frequency thresholds (8–18 kHz) in both ears of the SCUBA group compared to the control group (p= 0.001, Table1).

Comparison of c‐VEMP SCM muscle contractions between right and left ears revealed no statistically significant differences in either the control or SCUBA groups (p> 0.05, Table2). The c‐VEMP Amplitude Asymmetry Ratio (AAR) values were less than 0.35 in all participants.

Statistically significant differences were observed in P1‐N1 latencies of right ears and N1 latencies of left ears when comparing the SCUBA group with the control group. The c‐VEMP latencies were significantly prolonged in the SCUBA group compared to the control group (right ear P1 latency:p= 0.037; right ear N1 latency:p= 0.003; left ear N1 latency:p= 0.039). No significant difference was observed in P1 latencies of left ears (p> 0.05; Table3).

Statistically significant differences in c‐VEMP amplitude values were observed when comparing the control and SCUBA groups for both right and left ears (right ear P1‐N1 amplitude:p= 0.001; left ear P1‐N1 amplitude:p= 0.001; Table4). The SCUBA group demonstrated remarkably increased c‐VEMP amplitude values.

The frequency of abnormal c‐VEMP findings was assessed for each group. For right ear latency, the proportion of abnormal P1 latencies in the Control group (8.3%) was not significantly different from the SCUBA group (14.3%) (p= 0.63, Fisher's Exact Test). The proportion of abnormal N1 latencies in the SCUBA group (14.3%) was not significantly different from the Control group (4.2%) (p= 0.30, Fisher's Exact Test). For left ear P1 latencies, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of abnormal findings between the Control group 3/24 [8.3%]; SCUBA: 0/21 [12.5%] (p= 0.23, Fisher's Exact Test). Similarly, for left ear N1 latencies, the difference in the proportion of abnormal findings between the Control: 1/24 [4.2%]; SCUBA: 2/21 [9.5%] was not statistically significant (p= 0.59, Fisher's Exact Test). A significantly higher proportion of participants in the SCUBA group exhibited an abnormal amplitude compared to the Control group (R‐Amplitudes, Control: 3/24 [8.3%]; SCUBA: 16/21 [76.2%],p< 0.0001, L‐Amplitudes, Control: 1/24 [4.2%]; SCUBA: 16/21 [76.2%], Fisher's Exact Test, Fisher's Exact Test).

This study aimed to investigate potential alterations in the peripheral vestibular system resulting from inner ear barotrauma in SCUBA divers exposed to hyperbaric environments, utilizing c‐VEMP testing. To this end, P1‐N1 latencies and amplitudes in c‐VEMP responses were analyzed. Our findings suggest that the observed prolongation of P1‐N1 latencies and particularly the increased amplitudes in c‐VEMP responses of SCUBA divers exposed to hyperbaric environments may reflect changes in saccular function due to effects on otolithic structures.

Barometric pressure at sea level is 100 k Pascals (kPa) and increases linearly with each 10 m of descent underwater, adding 100 kPa. As depth increases, the diver breathes increasingly concentrated gas, while the diving equipment provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide [3,6]. Increased depth and pressure also result in a decrease in the volume of gas and an increase in the amount of gas dissolved in body tissues [6,25]. Otologic conditions of barotrauma, decompression, and alternobaric vertigo that can result from SCUBA diving are related to the changing gas behavior under pressure as the diver descends [3,6]. Barotrauma is the most common medical problem in scuba diving and can involve any structure that causes gas to become trapped in an enclosed space [4,6]. Inner ear barotrauma is the most serious form of barotrauma because of the potential for permanent damage to the cochleavestibular system, which can lead to permanent hearing loss and/or vestibular dysfunction [25]. Divers may complain of severe headache, blurred vision, double vision, dysarthria, dizziness, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo, as well as changes in mental status and personality [3,4,26].

Campos et al. [27] conducted a cross‐sectional study in a coastal village in southern Chile, examining 125 male shellfish divers. They assessed hearing loss through audiometric testing between 500 and 3000 Hz, categorizing results as sensorineural, conductive, unilateral, or mixed hearing loss. Their findings revealed a high prevalence of hearing impairment among professional shellfish divers, with more than 50% of affected individuals exhibiting audiograms consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. Similarly, our study demonstrated statistically significant elevations in hearing thresholds—though still within normal limits—among SCUBA divers compared to controls across a broad frequency spectrum (PTA kHz,p= 0.001; 8–18 kHz,p= 0.001). This statistically supported increase suggests potential early development of sensorineural hearing loss, consistent with previous literature.

Inner ear barotrauma and/or decompression sickness can cause acute vestibular symptoms in SCUBA divers and result in irreversible damage to the peripheral and central vestibular systems [28]. Goplen et al. [29] conducted a study evaluating the vestibular system among 230 open‐water divers and 166 controls and showed that the prevalence of dizziness (28%), rotating vertigo (14%), and unsteady gait (25%) was significantly higher in divers than in controls. In this study, they found that inner ear barotrauma and decompression sickness can cause acute vestibular symptoms in divers. The vestibular system effects can lead to conditions such as vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance. Vestibular system evaluations can be made with vestibular tests. The VEMP test studies initiated by Colebatch and his colleagues in 1992 [30], which provide valuable information in terms of evaluating the vestibular system, have been used frequently in clinics in recent years. Although there are a limited number of c VEMP studies, in this objective test method, which evaluates otolith functions, it has been shown that there are changes in the sacculocolic reflex due to adaptation in the hyperbaric environment [17].

In a study by Lavon et al. [17] c‐VEMP was employed to assess saccular function in 12 professional divers immediately post‐diving and after a minimum 24‐h recovery period, revealing decreased N23 latency. They proposed that long‐term adaptation of the sacculocolic reflex to underwater conditions necessitates enhanced reflex sensitivity to compensate for decreased linear velocity and acceleration with reduced otolith stimulation. In contrast to previous findings, our study observed prolonged right ear P1‐N1 and left ear N1 latencies in SCUBA divers exposed to hyperbaric environments while evaluating hearing thresholds across a broad frequency spectrum. The statistical differences in hearing threshold responses suggest potential delays in sacculocolic reflex responses due to decreased otolith stimulation. This highlights the importance of comprehensive audiometric evaluation across a wide frequency range, even within normal hearing limits, particularly when utilizing auditory stimuli for VEMP testing. Our study found significantly higher c‐VEMP amplitudes and, individually, a greater prevalence of abnormal amplitude responses observed bilaterally in the SCUBA diver group compared to controls. This robust increase in amplitude likely represents a neurophysiological adaptation to the recurrent stress of hyperbaric exposure. We propose that this finding is evidence of adaptive saccular plasticity, where the sacculocolic reflex becomes heightened or sensitized. Clinically, this finding is significant because it demonstrates that c‐VEMP can detect subclinical, adaptive changes in the vestibular system. While not indicative of a disease state on its own, this enhanced amplitude serves as an objective biomarker of the cumulative physiological load that diving places on the inner ear.

Conversely, a hypobaric study [31] reported that spaceflight (exposure to microgravity) alleviates the gravitational load normally imposed on the utricular epithelium, resulting in decreased synaptic density. Similarly, Ross et al. [32,33] reported that under microgravity conditions, ribbon synapse density in the utricular epithelium initially increased, while in the saccular epithelium, density initially decreased before subsequently increasing in later stages. These findings collectively demonstrate synaptic modifications in both utricular and saccular epithelia in response to altered environmental conditions.

In contrast to the decreased synaptic density observed in saccular and utricular maculae under hypobaric conditions (particularly in space environments), we hypothesized that synaptic density would increase in hyperbaric environments. Despite limited research in this area, based on our findings, we propose that the enhanced amplitude responses observed in SCUBA divers exposed to hyperbaric environments likely result from heightened sacculocolic reflexes, reflecting adaptive saccular plasticity. As a limitation, our assessment focused exclusively on the saccule via c‐VEMP. A more comprehensive vestibular test battery, including o‐VEMP for utricular function and v‐HIT for semicircular canal function, would have provided a more complete perspective of the effects of diving on the entire inner ear. In addition, we are observing experienced divers at a single point in time, not tracking changes as they develop. A prospective, longitudinal study that follows divers from their initial certification over several years would be invaluable. This would allow for the tracking of c‐VEMP changes from a baseline and provide stronger evidence for a causal link between diving and vestibular plasticity. To build a more holistic understanding, future studies should incorporate a full battery of vestibular tests (c‐VEMP, o‐VEMP, vHIT, calorics) to simultaneously assess the function of the otolith organs and the semicircular canals.

Sharoni et al. [34] evaluated vestibular function in professional divers using the Smooth Pursuit test. Their results demonstrated significantly decreased pursuit speed values in professional divers compared to controls, which they attributed to neural plasticity processes. A study by Shambhu et al. [35] investigated the effects of yoga practice on sacculocolic pathway function using c‐VEMP. They evaluated 40 regular yoga practitioners and a control group of non‐practitioners, comparing P1‐N1 complex amplitudes, asymmetry ratios, and P1‐N1 latencies between groups. Results revealed significantly increased P1‐N1 complex amplitudes and decreased latencies in the yoga group. The authors attributed these changes to plasticity within the vestibular system and enhanced muscle strength resulting from regular yoga practice. Similarly, another study comparing c‐VEMP responses between 40 professional dancers and 80 non‐professionals demonstrated statistically significant increases in P1‐N1 amplitudes and decreased P1‐N1 latencies among professional dancers. These differences were likewise attributed to plasticity within the sacculocolic pathway developed through dance training [36].

This study utilized c‐VEMP to identify objective neurophysiological changes in the peripheral vestibular systems of SCUBA divers. The primary finding was a statistically significant increase in c‐VEMP amplitudes in the diver group compared to controls. We propose that this reflects adaptive saccular plasticity, where the sacculocolic reflex is heightened in response to prolonged exposure to hyperbaric environments. Furthermore, the observed prolongation of P1‐N1 latencies and the elevation of hearing thresholds—even while within normal clinical limits—suggest the presence of subclinical stress on the cochleovestibular system, likely due to repeated inner ear barotrauma. Taken together, these findings indicate that c‐VEMP testing is a sensitive tool capable of detecting early, adaptive, and potentially pathological changes in vestibular function in divers before significant clinical symptoms may be present.
