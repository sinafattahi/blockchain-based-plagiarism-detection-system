Amid profound shifts in the global energy landscape, increasing attention is being paid to the causal relationships among geopolitical risks, government governance, and energy transition. Based on data covering 39 countries from 2002 to 2020, this study explores the long-term causal relationships between geopolitical risks, governance quality, and energy transition. The analysis applies cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity tests, the CADF unit root test, second-generation cointegration methods, Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimation, Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), and Granger causality tests. The results yield three key findings. Firstly, governance quality is negatively associated with energy transition, while geopolitical risks have a positive effect. Secondly, MMQR shows that these effects are more pronounced at higher quantiles of the energy transition distribution, meaning countries further along in the transition process are more responsive to changes in governance and geopolitical conditions. Thirdly, heterogeneity tests indicate that geopolitical risks exhibit a more pronounced long-term positive contribution to energy transition in economically high-growth and highly urbanized countries. These findings challenge dominant assumptions in the literature, particularly the presumed uniformly positive role of governance. The results suggest that the influence of governance and geopolitical risks on energy transition is context-dependent and nonlinear. This study provides new empirical evidence and theoretical insights to inform energy policy under geopolitical uncertainty.

Global climate change presents a profound and escalating threat to ecological systems, economic development, and social welfare [1]. This growing crisis, primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption, has drawn extensive attention from the international community [2]. In response, many countries have committed to carbon neutrality and have begun to transform their energy systems by shifting from fossil fuels toward low-carbon and renewable alternatives [3]. This transformation, commonly referred to as energy transition, is a central component of global strategies aimed at achieving sustainable development and mitigating climate risks [4].

Although the necessity of energy transition is well recognized, its realization remains uneven across countries. While previous studies have focused on technical, economic, and environmental drivers of energy transition, the roles of geopolitical uncertainty and institutional capacity remain insufficiently explored [5]. In particular, recent geopolitical disruptions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have brought renewed attention to how geopolitical risks shape national energy policies and influence the pace of transition [6,7]. These risks can affect energy security, investment environments, and international cooperation, thereby either impeding or accelerating progress toward low-carbon systems.

The literature presents divergent perspectives on the effects of geopolitical risk. Some scholars argue that rising geopolitical instability discourages renewable energy investment due to increased macroeconomic uncertainty and policy volatility [8]. Others contend that geopolitical crises can catalyze energy diversification by exposing the strategic vulnerabilities of fossil fuel dependence, as seen in Europe’s push for renewable energy following the breakdown of its energy ties with Russia. These contrasting views highlight the need for systematic empirical research that evaluates the long-term causal impacts of geopolitical risk on energy transition.

In parallel, the role of government governance in the energy transition process warrants closer examination. Governance, in this context, refers to the institutional capacity of the state to design, implement, and sustain coherent energy and climate policies. Effective governance enhances regulatory credibility, reduces transaction costs, and promotes policy coordination, all of which are essential for long-term investment in clean energy. During periods of geopolitical volatility, high-quality governance can also mitigate risk exposure by ensuring adaptive policy responses [9]. However, the theoretical and empirical linkages between governance quality and energy transition remain fragmented in the current literature. Few studies have rigorously conceptualized how governance mediates or moderates the effects of geopolitical risks on energy transition outcomes.

Although some research has addressed the role of energy pricing or environmental regulation, few studies have investigated the dynamic and long-term relationships between energy transition, government governance, and geopolitical risks [10]. Moreover, much of the existing work focuses on bivariate or unidirectional causality, which fails to capture the complexity of interactions among these factors. This gap is particularly notable in cross-national contexts, where heterogeneity in governance structures and geopolitical exposure is likely to influence energy trajectories in diverse ways.

Recent empirical studies have employed wavelet-based and nonparametric methods to investigate relationships among energy-related variables [11,12]. While these techniques are effective in capturing short-term dynamics, they are susceptible to spurious regression when applied to non-stationary or cointegrated data without appropriate econometric controls. As highlighted by Phillips and Pesaran, failing to account for cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity in macro-panel data may lead to biased or inconsistent estimates, limiting the reliability of such approaches in long-term causal analysis [13,14].

To overcome these limitations, this study adopts a robust empirical framework based on second-generation panel econometric techniques. Using balanced panel data for 39 countries from 2002 to 2020, we apply cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity tests, the CADF unit root test, and the Westerlund cointegration test to establish long-run equilibrium relationships. The Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator is employed to assess long-term associations, while the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) model captures heterogeneous effects across the energy transition distribution. In addition, Granger causality analysis is used to explore bidirectional dynamics. This integrated approach ensures greater robustness and generalizability in identifying structural relationships among energy transition, governance, and geopolitical risk.

This study contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, it moves beyond unidirectional analysis by assessing the bidirectional causal relationships between geopolitical risk, governance, and energy transition. This approach reveals the interdependence and feedback mechanisms that are often overlooked in previous studies. Secondly, the study introduces MMQR to assess how the effects of governance and geopolitical risk vary across different levels of energy transition performance. This quantile-based approach accounts for country-level heterogeneity and identifies asymmetries in policy responsiveness. Thirdly, by employing a large and diverse dataset covering 39 countries over nearly two decades, the study offers more generalizable insights into global energy transition processes. Finally, it provides theoretical and empirical clarity on the role of institutions in shaping energy futures under conditions of geopolitical uncertainty, generating implications for energy governance, investment policy, and climate strategy.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After this introductory section, the following section provides a comprehensive review of prior literature on energy transitions, government governance, and geopolitical risks. Subsequently, the research data and methodology are introduced in details. The empirical findings are then presented, followed by robustness tests confirming the stability of the primary results. Next, heterogeneity across subgroups is examined. Finally, we draw the key conclusions, discuss the policy implications, and outlind the future research directions. To illustrate the research steps vividly, we draw the research framework graph, which is shown in Fig.1.

Research on energy transition has increasingly acknowledged the significance of geopolitical risks and government governance in influencing national energy strategies. However, most existing studies focus on individual or paired relationships between these variables and seldom examine how they interact in shaping long-term energy trajectories. This section reviews the existing literature in three thematic areas, aiming to clarify empirical findings, identify conceptual gaps, and establish the basis for this study’s analytical framework.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has brought renewed attention to the role of geopolitical uncertainty in energy systems [15]. A substantial body of research suggests that geopolitical risks negatively affect renewable energy development by creating policy uncertainty, discouraging investment, and prompting short-term reversion to fossil fuels. For example, Bashir et al. demonstrate that in emerging economies, rising geopolitical tensions significantly suppress renewable energy consumption [16]. Similarly, Zhao et al. find that in OECD countries, increased geopolitical risk reduces the demand for clean energy due to risk aversion among policymakers and investors [17].

In contrast, other studies offer an opposing view, suggesting that geopolitical crises can catalyze structural shifts in energy strategies. Sweidan provides evidence that countries facing geopolitical shocks may accelerate renewable energy deployment to reduce dependence on volatile external suppliers [6]. Wang et al. support this perspective by showing that heightened GPR can increase institutional and public support for long-term energy diversification [18]. These contradictory findings suggest that the influence of GPR on ET is likely context-dependent and potentially asymmetric.

Recent developments in energy finance further highlight the complexity of this relationship. Cheng et al. use a Bayesian pdBEKK-GARCH model with regime switching to analyze the gold-oil dynamic relationship under geopolitical shocks, revealing that risk regimes shift significantly in response to conflict events [19]. Although this research focuses on financial asset markets, it underscores the transmission channels through which GPR affects energy price volatility, investor sentiment, and, by extension, the feasibility of clean energy transitions.

Government governance usually refers to the ability of a government to designate and implement good policies effectively [9,20]. In the context of energy markets, particularly under conditions of heightened geopolitical risk, governance plays a crucial role in shaping national responses. While few studies explicitly explore the direct relationship between geopolitical risks and governance systems, there is growing empirical evidence that governance quality moderates the effects of geopolitical disruptions on economic and policy outcomes. Stronger governance structures have been shown to mitigate the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on cross-border investments [21], while also safeguarding macroeconomic stability in the face of external shocks [22]. These studies suggest that governance structures can serve as institutional buffers, absorbing external shocks and facilitating more stable and predictable policy environments.

However, most of this literature remains disconnected from the broader discourse on energy transition. What is often missing is a conceptual linkage between governance capacity and the management of long-term energy system transformations. Governance determines how countries design, prioritize, and adapt energy transition policies, especially under uncertainty. In periods of geopolitical volatility, states with higher governance quality are better positioned to maintain consistent regulatory frameworks, attract green investment, and implement adaptive policy tools [20]. Conversely, weak governance may exacerbate volatility by creating regulatory vacuums, delaying strategic planning, or undermining public trust.

From this perspective, governance is not simply a contextual factor but a central mechanism through which geopolitical risks influence energy transition trajectories. Yet, few studies examine how governance and geopolitical risks jointly affect energy policy evolution, or how these relationships unfold over time. This gap is particularly evident in the lack of empirical research investigating the long-run and potentially bidirectional causality between governance, geopolitical risk, and energy transition outcomes. Addressing this void is critical for constructing a more comprehensive analytical framework, and constitutes a core motivation of the present study.

Government governance plays a pivotal role in enabling and sustaining energy transition. Effective governance supports the formulation and implementation of consistent energy policies, mobilizes long-term investments, ensures regulatory stability, and fosters institutional resilience [23]. In the context of transitioning to low-carbon systems, these functions become particularly critical [24,25]. Strong governance enhances policy coherence and improves institutional responsiveness to evolving climate and energy challenges.

Many studies have shown that governance quality correlates positively with decarbonization outcomes, often through channels such as legislation enforcement, regulatory effectiveness, and coordination across sectors [26]. For instance, legal and institutional strength can amplify the effect of climate laws on renewable energy deployment, while weak governance may undermine the credibility or continuity of energy reforms. Some perspectives argue that liberalized markets may advance transition under certain conditions, but others highlight that inclusive and participatory governance is essential for maintaining social legitimacy and managing long-term systemic shifts [27].

However, existing research seldom considers how governance performance evolves under external pressures, particularly during geopolitical instability. It remains unclear whether the institutional mechanisms that facilitate transition in normal times can also buffer the disruptive effects of geopolitical shocks, or whether such shocks instead compromise institutional trust and reorient priorities toward short-term energy security [28]. The literature has yet to establish whether governance serves merely as an enabler in stable contexts or also acts as a stabilizer under crisis.

Although prior studies have investigated bilateral relationships among government governance (GOV), geopolitical risks (GPR), and energy transition (ET), limited attention has been paid to their integrated analysis. However, the novelty of this study is not solely derived from combining these variables, but from the theoretical and empirical importance of examining their dynamic interdependence.

Theoretically, the transition to sustainable energy systems is shaped by both internal institutional capacities and external geopolitical pressures. Geopolitical risks, manifested through conflict, trade disruptions, or regional instability, introduce uncertainty that can either hinder or accelerate the energy transition depending on the policy environment. Government governance functions as a critical moderating mechanism as it shapes regulatory coherence, supports investment in renewable energy infrastructure, and enables adaptive policy responses under conditions of uncertainty. Ignoring these interdependencies risks overlooking how states navigate energy reform processes in volatile global contexts. Empirically, the existing literature tends to treat the variables in isolation, which limits a comprehensive understanding of how energy transitions unfold under geopolitical pressure. Studies often concentrate on narrowly defined samples or utilize static models that do not reflect long-run interactions or feedback mechanisms. Consequently, there is limited insight into how governance and geopolitical factors jointly influence energy policy effectiveness and sustainability outcomes.

This study addresses these limitations by employing a comprehensive empirical framework that examines the long-term relationships and causal interactions among GPR, GOV, and ET using panel data from 39 countries over the period 2002 to 2020. By incorporating second-generation econometric techniques, the analysis accounts for cross-sectional dependence and structural heterogeneity, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of its findings. Conceptually, it positions governance not as a peripheral condition but as an active institutional force that mediates the effects of geopolitical volatility on energy transition outcomes. This integrated perspective contributes both to scholarly understanding and to the formulation of resilient, evidence-based energy policies.

This study investigates the long-run relationships among government governance (GOV), geopolitical risks (GPR), and energy transition (ET). Government governance is measured using a composite index based on the six dimensions of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI): voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption [20]. The WGI compiles data from over 30 international sources, offering a broad and comparable assessment of institutional quality across countries. Each sub-index is normalized to a [0,1] scale using the min-max method to ensure comparability. The entropy weighting method is then applied to endogenously determine the relative importance of each dimension based on its informational contribution, thereby minimizing subjectivity. This approach has been validated in recent cross-country studies on governance and sustainability [22]. The resulting GOV index reflects the overall institutional capacity of a country. It serves not only as a determinant of energy policy effectiveness but also as a moderating factor in the face of geopolitical risk, supporting this study’s analysis of long-run relationships and bidirectional causality among governance, geopolitical tensions, and energy transition.

Geopolitical risk (GPR) is measured using the index developed by Caldara and Iacoviello, which quantifies the intensity of geopolitical tensions based on the share of newspaper articles referencing adverse events such as military threats, nuclear risks, war escalation, or terrorist acts [29]. The index is constructed from automated text analysis of ten major international newspapers, capturing both geopolitical threats and realized acts. While the original index is reported at the monthly level, we compute annual averages to align with the temporal frequency of our macro-level panel data and to mitigate the influence of short-term volatility. The GPR index has been widely adopted in the literature as a proxy for exogenous geopolitical shocks affecting economic policy and energy security [30], making it particularly suitable for assessing the external risk environment in the context of energy transition.

This study initially sums the extracted monthly geopolitical risks data for 43 countries and regions into an annual data, which are then matched with the data on the level of electricity generation from renewable energy and the data on government governance scores calculated using the entropy method. Finally, given the availability of data and the requirements of the research methodology for balanced panel data, we selected 39 countries (see Appendix1) and developed a balanced panel covering each of the 39 countries from 2002 to 2020. This paper uses Stata 17.0 to carry out all empirical analyses.

Initially, in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of the study, we first performed a logarithmic transformation on the balanced panel data obtained above. Then, we report the scatter plots of ET and GPR, ET and GOV, as showed in Figs.2and3. The figures show that the renewable energy electricity generation of most countries range from − 5.0 to 5.0, while the geopolitical risk of large majority of countries is between − 2.0 and 2.0. We observe for each country that the two variables in time are enough to have the same trend and make a fitted line to the trend for all countries. Furthermore, the fitted line between ET and GPR indicates a positive-going association between GPR and ET. Similarly, we find that the Government governance mainly between − 2 and 0, and the fitting line shows an opposite correlation between ET and GOV. this paper conducts the further investigation to reveal the long-run cointegration linkages and causal relationships between these three variables.

Then, we perform descriptive statistics on GPR, GOV, and ET and present the results in Table2. We list the observations (N), mean (Mean), standard deviation (SD), minimum (Min), median (median) and maximum (Max) for each -variable separately. As presented in Table2, the mean value, maximum value, and minimum value of GPR are 0.064, 4.028, and − 3.396, respectively. These results suggest that geopolitical risk varies considerably across countries. The mean value, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of GOV are − 0.760, -0.042, -2.262, and 0.558, respectively. This indicates that the level of government governance is more balanced in terms of performance. As for ET, the standard deviation and mean value are 3.057 and 1.912, respectively, suggesting that there is a great deal of variation in the energy transitions of these countries.

The study explores the link between government governance, geopolitical risks, and energy transition using balanced panel dataset. Given the global scope of the data, it is likely that cross-sectional dependence (CSD) exists due to regional linkages and common global shocks [31]. To address these issues, the analysis first applies CSD and slope heterogeneity tests to properly diagnose panel properties. Second-generation unit root and cointegration tests that account for CSD are then used to enhance the reliability of long-run equilibrium inference. The long-term relationships among the variables are estimated using the PMG approach, and the MMQR method is applied to capture distributional heterogeneity. Finally, the Granger causality test is conducted to explore the direction of causality among the variables. Figure4presents the research methodology process.

In line with previous research [42], this study aims to examine the impact of GOV and GPR on ET from both short and long-term perspectives. To address the challenges of non-stationarity, cross-sectional dependence (CSD), and slope heterogeneity, the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator is employed. This approach is appropriate for macro-panel data, as it allows for country-specific short-run dynamics and error variances while imposing homogeneity on long-run coefficients [43]. Such a structure is consistent with the theoretical expectation that countries may exhibit different short-run responses due to institutional or economic disparities, but converge toward similar long-run trajectories under common global pressures such as climate agreements or governance reforms [44].

In additional, to examine how the effects of government governance and geopolitical risks on energy transition vary across different distributional levels of the dependent variable, this study employs the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) developed by Machado and Santos Silva [46]. Unlike traditional quantile regression, which estimates effects conditional on covariates, MMQR captures unconditional quantile effects, offering a broader view of distributional heterogeneity [47]. This feature is particularly useful in our context, as it allows the analysis to go beyond average effects and reveal whether governance and geopolitical risks exert stronger influence in countries with relatively low or high levels of renewable energy development. Given the asymmetric policy and institutional environments across countries, a method capable of capturing such variation is essential.

Although panel data usually has significant dependence, if we ignore it, the validity of the estimation is severely reduced. Therefore, to assess the presence of cross-sectional dependence, we perform the Pesaran tests [33,34]. The outcomes of the CSD tests are displayed in Table3.

Firstly, the Pesaran (2004) test indicates that GPR demonstrates CSD, with a statistically significant result of 24.49 at the 1% level [33]. And the statistic of CSD test for ET is also significant at the 1% level with the CSD statistic of 37.92 but the statistic of CSD test for GOV is -0.51 and not significant, which shows the variable of GOV doesn’t exhibit the CSD. Furthermore, the findings of Pesaran (2015)’s CSD statistic for GPR, GOV, and ET are 3.131, 116.874, and 36.573, respectively [34]. All of the variables are significantly at the 1% level, which shows that three variables exist the characteristics of the weak CSD. This suggests the presence of CSD in the panel data, which is something we have to consider in the subsequent analytical methods we employ.

Moving on, in Table4, the SH test is highly significant. This demonstrates that there is slope heterogeneity existing in the panels.

Considering that all variables in panel data exist the problem of CSD and existence of heterogeneity, it suggests that conventional unit root and cointegration tests may make mistakes. In contrast to conventional unit root and cointegration tests, this research employs the second-generation panel CADF unit root test and the cointegration test developed by Westerlund and Edgerton [41].

This research utilizes the IPS test and CADF test to investigate the presence of unit roots in the panel data. The results are presented in Table5. The IPS unit root test and the second generation CADF unit root test yielded the following results. In the IPS test, the statistic of GOV is 1.161 and the statistic of ET is 1.450, which do not reach the 10% level of significance. However, the statistic of GPR is significant at 1% level. But the significance statistics of GPR, GOV, and ET after first-order difference all pass the 1% level. Similarly, the results of CADF test have the same significance levels as the IPS test, which confirm that all variables are stationary after the first difference. The results of the IPS and CADF tests indicate that there is a unit root in the original series and the data are non-stationary. While the series after first-order differencing is stationary, indicating that all three variables obey the same order of monotonicity and can continue to be tested for cointegration.

After finding that three variables have the characteristics of CSD and I (1) progress, this paper conducts Kao (1999) test, Pedroni (2004) test, Westerlund (2005) test, and Westerlund and Edgerton (2007) cointegration test, which takes CSD into account. The cointegration tests for three variables are presented in Table6. The ET is considered as the dependent variable, whereas GPR, GOV, and GPR and GOV are the independent variables, respectively. As shown in Table6, although the statistics of Kao (1999) test and Westerlund (2005) test are insignificant, the statistics of Pedroni (2004) test almost all pass the significance level at 10% level, and similar results are observed in Westerlund and Edgerton (2007) test, which to some extent reveals that GOV, GPR, and ET exhibit a long-term cointegration. The results of the above tests indicate that the three variable series have a common trend and there is a long-run equilibrium relationship.

In this particular section of our analysis, we specifically examine the correlations between three variables in both the short and long term. By utilizing PMG estimation, we effectively present the outcomes of our study, which are displayed in Table7.

The findings highlight the long-run effects of GOV and GPR on ET. The coefficient for GOV is -0.788 and statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating a negative association between governance quality and renewable energy transition in the long term. This result contrasts with prior studies that generally find a positive link, and it warrants closer conceptual scrutiny [20]. One plausible interpretation is that in countries with highly efficient and established governance systems, energy sectors are often deeply embedded within legacy industrial and regulatory frameworks. These systems may favor incumbents in fossil fuel-intensive industries, leading to institutional inertia that slows structural change despite formal governance capacity [52]. In such contexts, robust governance may preserve existing energy regimes rather than facilitate transition, especially in the absence of strong environmental mandates.

Conversely, in countries with relatively weaker governance, limited state capacity may leave energy supply more exposed to market forces. In these settings, the expansion of renewable energy may occur not through deliberate state-led intervention but as a pragmatic response to energy insecurity, volatile fossil fuel prices, or international donor influence [53]. Therefore, the negative long-run relationship observed in this study could reflect differentiated pathways of transition, where high-governance countries face stronger structural resistance to change, while lower-governance countries experience bottom-up or externally induced shifts. These findings suggest that governance quality alone does not unconditionally accelerate energy transition. Instead, the institutional configuration, policy priorities, and stakeholder influence embedded within governance systems may critically shape the direction and pace of decarbonization.

As shown in Table7, the coefficient of GPR stands at 0.307 and demonstrates statistical significance at the 1% level, providing empirical evidence that geopolitical risks play a facilitating role in energy transition over the long term. This result aligns with recent empirical evidence that geopolitical instability prompts countries to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and to enhance domestic renewable energy capacity [18,54]. As energy security becomes more uncertain, especially during international conflicts or trade disruptions, governments may adopt proactive policies that encourage the deployment of alternative energy sources.

The short-run estimation results are also provided in Table7. The coefficient of the error correction term (ECM) is -0.158 and statistically significant at the 1% level. The coefficient of the error correction term (ECM) is -0.158 and statistically significant at the 1% level, confirming that deviations from long-run equilibrium are gradually corrected over time and indicating the presence of a stable adjustment mechanism. In contrast, the short-run coefficients for ΔGOV (-0.399) and ΔGPR (0.039) are statistically insignificant, suggesting that neither governance quality nor geopolitical risk has an immediate effect on energy transition. This implies that their influence operates primarily through long-term institutional shifts or cumulative policy adaptations rather than short-term shocks. The direction of these coefficients, however, suggests potential suppressive effects of governance and marginally positive impacts of geopolitical uncertainty, although not robust in the short term. These findings may reflect structural frictions in the transition process. For instance, governments must often manage the competing interests of traditional energy sectors and emerging renewable industries, which can delay short-term adjustments. Similarly, the impact of geopolitical risks may be mitigated by diversified energy import strategies, limiting their immediate influence on transition outcomes [55]. These results have the consistent tendency with the scatter plot. It is obvious that long-run effects are more important when we consider the impact of geopolitical risks and government governance.

Overall, the PMG results underscore the importance of temporal dynamics in understanding the drivers of energy transition. While geopolitical shocks can expose vulnerabilities in fossil-fuel reliance and accelerate long-run adaptation, the role of governance appears more complex, potentially shaped by regulatory inertia, stakeholder resistance, and institutional design. These results highlight the need for a more nuanced framework to assess how institutional capacity and external disruptions jointly shape the path toward decarbonization.

To further probe distributional heterogeneity, this study employs the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) model. This approach complements the PMG results by revealing how the effects of GOV and GPR on ET vary across different levels of energy transition, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation of average relationships. The results are presented in Table8and demonstrate how the effects of governance and geopolitical risk vary across the distribution of energy transition.

The increase in the percentage of GPR results in a significant increase in ET by 0.0975%, 0.3247%, and 0.4396% at,, andscales, respectively. This indicates that the positive impact of geopolitical risk has a tendency to increase at the higher quantiles. For one reason, high-quartile geopolitical risks could spur innovation and technological development and drive acceleration of the energy transition [30]. Countries and enterprises are likely to seek more competitive and reliable energy solutions, leading to technological innovation and development that will drive the energy transition. For another reason, when energy supplies are threatened in countries with high geopolitical risk, governments may be forced to take measures to reduce energy dependence on geopolitically unstable regions and shift to more sustainable and secure energy options [8]. In contrast, at, GPR’s effect is negative and statistically insignificant, indicating that countries with low levels of ET may lack the capacity or policy mechanisms to respond effectively to geopolitical shocks. On the whole, GPR has the positive promotion on ET, which is consistent with the PMG findings.

The outcomes for GOV present a negative impact on ET and only the value ofdoes not pass the 10% significance test. And with the statistic from − 0.0510% to -1.1866%, the impact has the tendency to increase at the higher quantiles. Countries with higher levels of government governance are likely to be more conservative or maintain inertia in the allocation of resources and funds, resulting in lower support for energy transition and limiting the process of energy transition. These quantile results corroborate the PMG estimates and provide further insight. Although both GOV and GPR have significant long-run effects, their magnitude and direction vary across countries. The interaction between institutional capacity and geopolitical exposure influences not only the average pace of energy transition but also its distribution across different national contexts.

Above impacts of the variables are shown visually in Fig.5. The graph presents that as the quartile rises, GPR has an increasing positive contribution to ET and GOV has an increasing negative contribution to ET. It graphically describes the information in Table8.

Following the aforementioned series of tests, we proceed to investigate the causal relationships among the variables by employing the Granger causality test. To accomplish this, we utilize the Dumitrescu & Hurlin (2012) causality test, which is recognized in the field [51]. The lag order is determined based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), with a value of 1 chosen for our analysis. The outcomes are depicted in Table9. Besides thep-value of GPR to GOV, otherp-values passed the test at 10% level of significance, which indicates that there are two-way causal relationships between GOV and ET, GPR and ET, and there is a single causal relationship between GOV and GPR. Governments may have strong mechanisms to monitor and assess geopolitical risks and take measures to mitigate their adverse effects on national governance. As a result, the causal effect of geopolitical risks on government governance is relatively weak or insignificant. These tests all confirm the long-term impacts of geopolitical risks and government governance on energy transition. Figure6graphically shows the relationship.

Firstly, this paper adopts the entropy topsis method, which synthesizes the weights and interrelationships of the evaluation indicators, as well as the distance of the program from the ideal and anti-ideal solutions, to provide accurate, objective and interpretable decision results, to measure the quality of government governance, which is calculated with entropy method before. The scores (GOVT) replaced the original GOV are used as the proxy variable for government governance. Table10shows the new results obtained from the PMG estimation. We can see that GOVT significantly exerts a negative impact and GPR significantly exerts a positive impact on ET in the long term, and other empirical results are similar to the results in Table7, which support that our previous results have the reliability.

Furthermore, this study adopts the renewable energy consumption as a proportion of total energy consumption (REC) as a proxy variable for energy transition [56]. Due to differences in reporting frequency across countries, linear interpolation is applied to construct a balanced annual panel. Interpolation is a common and practical approach in macroeconomic and energy studies where data gaps are typically small and trends evolve gradually over time. Although interpolation may smooth short-term fluctuations, its impact on the estimated long-run relationships is expected to be minimal given the focus of this study on structural and persistent effects rather than high-frequency dynamics. To further mitigate concerns, interpolated values were cross-checked to ensure they remained consistent with reported data trends, and the REC variable was used primarily for robustness testing rather than as the main measure of energy transition. The outcomes of PMG estimation with new variables are presented in Table11. In the long-run, GOVT significantly exerts a negative impact on REC, but GPR also significantly inhibits REC, which is consistent to previous results. According to Shahbaz, Wang, et al. (2022), geopolitical risks exerts a negative impact on renewable energy consumption and the potential reasons maybe that fossil energy satisfy the immediate demands and geopolitical risks lead to an increase in the cost of living expenditures of the population and the decrease in the consumption of renewable energy [20]. The robustness test is conducted through alternative variables, and these two results further confirm the reliability of the previous findings of this paper.

To ensure robustness, we not only alter the variables, but also group them for testing. Based on the median of each variable’s data, we divide the sample into subsamples. For the groups where the level of energy transition is greater than the median of the energy transition, we label these groups as High-ET groups, and those where the values of the energy transitions are lower than the median of the energy transition are labeled as Low-ET groups. We do the same for the other two variables in the same way, so that we get six subsamples (See Appendix2). To investigate the existence of a long-term connection within the subsample data, our initial approach involves conducting the CADF unit root test. This test evaluates the stability of ET, GOV, and GPR after implementing first-order differencing. The results confirm their stability. Next, we conduct the Kao (1999) test, Pedroni (2004) test, Westerlund (2005) test, and Westerlund and Edgerton (2007) cointegration test to allow us to check for possible long-run cointegration in the subsampled data.

The results of the subsample cointegration analysis are reported in Tables12a-12f. Overall, the tests confirm the presence of long-run cointegration relationships between government governance, geopolitical risks, and energy transition across most subsamples, which is consistent with the main findings. Based on these results, PMG estimation was conducted for each subsample. However, it is notable that the direction and magnitude of the estimated coefficients exhibit some heterogeneity across subsamples, particularly between countries with higher and lower levels of energy transition, governance, and geopolitical risk. In some cases, the sign of the coefficients differs from the full-sample results, raising questions about internal consistency.

This heterogeneity likely reflects underlying structural and contextual differences across country groups. For example, in countries with high governance quality and advanced energy systems, institutional inertia and established industrial interests may hinder rapid transition, resulting in a negative association between governance and renewable energy adoption. Conversely, in lower-governance settings, market-driven adjustments or external donor influence may lead to a positive association, even in the absence of strong state intervention [57]. Similarly, the impact of geopolitical risk may depend on countries’ energy import dependence, diversification capacity, and strategic priorities, which vary significantly between groups.

While these findings underscore that the relationships between governance, geopolitical risks, and energy transition are not uniform, the general long-run patterns identified in the baseline model remain evident in most subsamples. The observed inconsistencies highlight the importance of considering country-specific institutional and geopolitical contexts when interpreting the results. Future research could further explore these mechanisms using more granular data and alternative identification strategies to better account for heterogeneity across settings.

To further examine heterogeneity, the PMG estimation is applied to subsamples, with results reported in Table13. The long-run estimates exhibit variation across groups, and some coefficient directions differ from the baseline results, which warrants cautious interpretation. In the high-ET group, the coefficients of GOV and GPR are − 0.034 and − 0.018, respectively, and neither is statistically significant at conventional levels. In contrast, in the low-ET group, the coefficients of GOV and GPR are 1.045 and 0.298, both significant at the 1% level, indicating that governance and geopolitical risks are associated with stronger energy transition dynamics in countries with lower initial transition levels.

The high-GOV group shows positive long-run coefficients for both GOV and GPR, although only GPR is statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that geopolitical risks can promote energy transition even in highly governed settings. In the low-GOV group, the GOV coefficient is − 0.859 and significant at the 1% level, while the GPR coefficient is 0.158 and significant at the 5% level. Similarly, in the high-GPR sample, GOV has a significant negative effect and GPR has a significant positive effect on energy transition, whereas in the low-GPR sample, neither coefficient is statistically significant.

Although the sign of the GOV coefficient in certain subgroups diverges from the full-sample estimate, this may reflect context-specific institutional dynamics and nonlinear effects. For example, in low-ET and high-GOV contexts, governance structures may facilitate transition through targeted interventions, while in high-GPR settings, the institutional inertia associated with governance could outweigh its facilitative role. These results highlight the complexity of institutional and geopolitical interactions and suggest that the influence of governance and risk factors is not uniform across country contexts.

In addition, Table13also lists the short-term PMG values for six subsamples. The results indicate that, within the subsamples, neither GOV nor GPR exhibits a statistically significant influence on ET in the short term. This further validates the accuracy of the benchmark results.

Overall, while the heterogeneity analysis reveals variation in coefficient signs and significance across subgroups, the general patterns remain consistent with the baseline results, and the robustness checks underscore the importance of contextual factors in shaping the relationship between institutional quality, geopolitical uncertainty, and energy transition.

To further assess the robustness of the main findings, the study employs a system GMM estimator as an alternative approach to address potential endogeneity and dynamic panel bias. Table14reports the results of the GMM estimation, where the lagged dependent variable is included to capture persistence in energy transition. The coefficient of the lagged dependent variable is 0.534 and highly significant, indicating strong path dependence in energy transition processes, which is consistent with theoretical expectations that structural energy shifts evolve gradually over time.

Importantly, the estimated effects of governance (GOV) and geopolitical risk (GPR) remain statistically significant and retain their directions, corroborating the baseline PMG results. Specifically, governance exhibits a negative and significant impact on energy transition, with a coefficient of -0.107. This suggests that even when accounting for endogeneity and dynamic adjustment, stronger governance is associated with slower progress in energy transition, possibly reflecting institutional inertia and the influence of entrenched stakeholders in well-governed economies. Geopolitical risk continues to demonstrate a positive and significant effect, with a coefficient of 0.043, further supporting the view that external shocks create incentives for diversifying away from fossil fuel dependence.

The diagnostic tests support the validity of the GMM specification. Thep-values for the Arellano-Bond AR(1) and AR(2) tests indicate no second-order serial correlation in the residuals, and the Hansen test statistic suggests that the instruments used are valid and not overidentified. Overall, the GMM estimation reinforces the reliability and internal consistency of the study’s main conclusions. It confirms that the observed long-run inhibitory effect of governance and the promoting effect of geopolitical risk on energy transition are not artifacts of model specification or omitted dynamics, but rather reflect robust empirical patterns across the panel of countries.

Firstly, we distinguish between countries exhibiting diverse rates of economic growth. Based on previous research, we utilize gross domestic product per capita as a surrogate measure for economic growth [56]. To conduct PMG estimation, this study adopts the median as a criterion to categorize sample countries into high and low growth classifications. The PMG results are presented in Table15. In high-growth countries, the GPR coefficient is estimated at 0.280 and is statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating that geopolitical risks have a long-run positive effect on energy transition. The GOV coefficient in this group is 0.078 but not statistically significant. In contrast, in low-growth countries, the GOV coefficient is -0.956 and significant at the 1% level, suggesting that stronger governance significantly inhibits energy transition in these contexts. This finding may reflect that low-growth countries face economic development pressures that constrain fiscal resources available for investing in energy transition. Furthermore, their greater dependence on traditional energy sources may reduce the political and economic incentives for governments to actively promote renewable energy development.

To examine whether the effects of GPR and GOV on ET vary with the degree of trade openness, the sample is divided into trade-open and trade-constrained countries based on their trade-to-GDP ratios [58]. The findings from the PMG estimation are presented in Table16. Across all sub-samples, the GPR demonstrates a significant positive effect on ET in the long run. After comparing the estimated coefficients, it becomes apparent that GPR plays a more significant role in facilitating ET in trade-open countries. In trade-open countries, GOV promotes ET, Conversely, in trade-constrained countries, GOV suppresses ET.

Notably, variations exist in the degree to which government governance impacts the energy transition across different trade-open countries. As we all know, countries that are more open to trade are usually subject to competitive pressures from other countries, so in order to enhance competitiveness, governments should implement measures aimed at promoting the transformation and upgrading of their respective industries. Increased trade openness facilitates the transition from partially non-renewable to renewable energy sources [27].

The heterogeneity with respect to urbanization is examined by using the share of urban population in the total population as the measure of urbanization to distinguish between countries [59]. In Table17, this paper presents the findings of the PMG estimation. For countries with high urbanization, the coefficient on GPR is statistically significant at the 1% level, with a value of 0.340. Likewise, the coefficient on GOV is -0.689, which also surpasses the threshold of statistical significance. This suggests that in countries with high levels of urbanization, GPR has a facilitating effect on ET while GOV has a dampening effect on ET. In contrast, for low-urbanization samples, the coefficient of GOV has a more pronounced negative impact on ET, with a value of -2.988 and statistical significance at the 1% level. Thus, these findings suggest that the hindering effect of GOV on ET is stronger in less urbanized countries.

This study analyzes balanced panel data from 39 countries over the period 2002 to 2020. The analysis first applies second-generation unit root and cointegration tests, which account for cross-sectional dependence, and confirms the existence of a long-run cointegration relationship among government governance (GOV), geopolitical risks (GPR), and energy transition (ET). Both short- and long-run effects are then examined using the Pooled Mean Group estimator, the Method of Moments Quantile Regression, and the Granger causality test. The robustness of the results is further verified through alternative variable specifications and subsample analyses, and heterogeneity tests are conducted to assess whether the relationships among GOV, GPR, and ET differ across groups of countries.

The findings confirm that the CADF and second-generation cointegration tests support the existence of a stable long-run relationship among GPR, GOV, and ET. The PMG estimation shows that, in the long run, GPR significantly promotes ET, while GOV significantly inhibits it. In the short run, neither variable has a significant effect, which suggests that their influence on ET emerges over time. The MMQR results indicate that the positive effect of GPR on ET becomes stronger at higher quantiles, and the negative effect of GOV on ET also intensifies at higher quantiles. The Granger causality test suggests bidirectional causality between GOV and ET, as well as between GPR and ET, while GOV also has a unidirectional effect on GPR. These results support the validity of the long-run findings from the PMG estimation.

The heterogeneity analysis based on economic growth, trade openness, and urbanization levels shows that the effects of GPR and GOV on ET vary across country contexts. The promoting effect of GPR on ET is stronger in countries with high economic growth, low trade openness, and high urbanization. In contrast, GOV promotes ET only in trade-open countries, while it dampens ET in countries with low economic growth, low trade openness, and low urbanization.

This study provides several actionable policy implications, grounded in the empirical findings. Firstly, the results show that geopolitical risks exert a positive long-run effect on energy transition, while government governance tends to inhibit it over time. Policymakers should therefore recognize that geopolitical shocks, while disruptive, can also act as catalysts for accelerating the shift away from fossil fuel dependence. Governments should proactively leverage periods of heightened geopolitical risk by introducing targeted regulations and incentives to support renewable energy deployment, rather than solely prioritizing short-term energy security concerns. For countries with strong governance systems, it is particularly important to address institutional inertia and entrenched interests that may slow the adoption of renewable energy, by strengthening environmental mandates and reforming regulatory frameworks to better align with decarbonization goals.

Secondly, the heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the effects of geopolitical risk and governance on energy transition vary significantly depending on economic growth, trade openness, and urbanization. This underscores the need for differentiated policy approaches. In high-growth and highly urbanized economies, policymakers should focus on removing structural barriers and mobilizing investment to scale up renewable energy. In contrast, in low-growth or trade-constrained economies, where renewable energy often fills gaps left by insufficient fossil fuel supply, governments should create enabling environments that allow market-driven renewable energy expansion, while maintaining sufficient policy support to sustain progress.

Thirdly, the findings also reveal that government governance has both the capacity to dampen and to facilitate energy transition depending on context. Policymakers should therefore actively reform governance practices that preserve the status quo and instead design policies that lower entry barriers for renewable technologies, foster innovation, and enhance stakeholder participation. Strengthening financial mechanisms, such as concessional lending, public–private partnerships, and targeted subsidies, is also critical to overcoming investment constraints identified in low-income and low-governance contexts.

Finally, since the empirical evidence shows that both geopolitical risks and governance quality influence energy transition in the long run, governments should adopt a more forward-looking and resilient policy strategy. This includes improving institutional flexibility to adapt to external shocks, fostering closer collaboration between high-tech industries and the energy sector, and building robust networks with financial institutions to ensure adequate capital flows into renewable energy projects. Enhanced innovation incentives and stronger policy guidance will also help to accelerate the conversion of research outcomes into practical applications, supporting structural upgrades of the energy sector.

To be honest, our study also has some limitations. Firstly, we only focus on these three variables, other related variables are not included, and less attention is paid to geopolitical risk and government governance. Secondly, there are different treatments for the data on government governance that will yield different indicators, and we just used the entropy method to do so, which is also worth exploring further in subsequent studies. Furthermore, due to the limited number of years between data, we have only examined global data from 2002 to 2020. As a result, our conclusions may lack some degree of accuracy in describing the current international situation. Finally, we propose two outlooks for future research. First, scholars can further study the intrinsic relationship between GOV and GPR based on the causal relationship between the two in this paper. The second is that researchers can expand the number of years of study and try to add the latest years of data, especially in the year 2023 when the sixth Israeli-Palestinian conflict has had a great impact on both the global economy and the energy market.
