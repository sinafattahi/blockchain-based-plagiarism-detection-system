The prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in pediatric dentistry has gained significant importance recently. Students are expected to care for children and adolescents as part of their professional training. To prevent serious complications, it is crucial to possess a comprehensive understanding of NSAID management. This study aimed to explore whether sociodemographic and academic factors are associated with Peruvian students’ knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry.

This cross-sectional analytical study assessed the knowledge of NSAID management in pediatric dentistry among 381 Peruvian dental students using a 20-item questionnaire, divided into the following dimensions: D1 (general knowledge about NSAIDs), D2 (NSAID dosage in pediatric dentistry), D3 (NSAID concentration in oral suspension for pediatric use), and D4 (indications and contraindications of NSAIDs). A chi-square test was employed for bivariable analysis, while a Poisson regression model with robust variance was utilized for multivariable analysis to identify associated factors. The significance level was established atp< 0.05.

A total of 17.6% of students demonstrated poor knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry, while 65.1% exhibited a fair level of knowledge and 17.3% showed good knowledge. Furthermore, third- and fourth-year students were 51% and 48% less likely, respectively, to possess a good level of knowledge compared to fifth-year students (PR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27–0.90 for third-year students; PR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.98 for fourth-year students). Additionally, age, sex, marital status, and place of origin were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge on this topic (p> 0.05).

Only a small percentage of dental students demonstrated good knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry. Furthermore, the findings revealed that students in their third and fourth years of study were less likely to possess a good level of knowledge in this area. On the other hand, factors such as age, sex, marital status, and place of origin did not appear to have a significant association with their knowledge.

One commonly utilized class of medications is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are known for their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties [1,2]. These attributes contribute to NSAIDs being among the most frequently prescribed and widely used medications globally across a range of clinical scenarios [2]. For this reason, NSAIDs are included in the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines due to their proven effectiveness in healthcare for the general population [3,4].

It is estimated that approximately 30 million people worldwide take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) daily [5]. According to Onder (2004), as cited in Wongrakpanich et al. (2018), NSAIDs account for 5–10% of all prescriptions issued annually [6]. Despite their effectiveness in managing various clinical conditions, NSAID use is associated with significant complications. Straus (2001), cited in Van den Bogert et al. (2017), reported that in the United States alone, NSAID-related adverse events result in over 100,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths annually, incurring healthcare costs of approximately $2 billion [7].

Evidence from various countries highlights the widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), often without medical supervision. In Pakistan, a study on the perception and practice of self-medication revealed that medical university students were the most frequent users of NSAIDs for self-medication [8]. In Australia, NSAIDs were prescribed during hospitalization and used at home on the first day following emergency dental extractions in patients under 18 years of age [9]. In Romania, the most commonly used NSAIDs were diclofenac, ketoprofen, and indomethacin [10]. Similarly, in Ecuador, the purchase of medications without a prescription was widespread, with NSAIDs being the most frequently acquired drug group [11]. In northern Peru, NSAIDs were mainly consumed in capsule form, with ibuprofen being the most preferred drug, followed by sodium naproxen [12]. In Metropolitan Lima, self-medication was also common, with NSAIDs among the drugs most frequently used by respondents [13]. These findings underscore the importance of reinforcing academic training on the safe and rational use of NSAIDs, particularly among future dental professionals, in order to reduce risks associated with misuse and self-medication practices [13,14].

In the dental setting, serious medical emergencies may arise, such as allergic or adverse reactions to medications. Therefore, it is essential for every dentist to be well-versed in therapeutic dosages and appropriate clinical procedures, particularly when treating pediatric patients, in order to prevent or minimize complications [15]. However, research indicates that a considerable percentage of dental students lack adequate knowledge about prescribing practices and the rational use of medications in dentistry [2,14].

It is essential for students aspiring to be healthcare professionals to understand the unique characteristics of pediatric patients. These differences necessitate a distinct approach compared to adult care. The complexity involved in determining the appropriate dosage for a child highlights the importance of a strong foundation in pharmacology [16,17]. Consequently, future dentists must develop both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, as these are critical for their professional performance. Effective medication management can prevent complications and enhance clinical outcomes [17,18].

It is important to note that this study is grounded in the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition, which describes the progression of individuals from novice to expert through successive stages. In this model, the development of competence depends on the complexity of the skill being acquired, the frequency of practice, the gradual increase in challenges, and the availability of a mentor who provides guidance and role modeling [19,20]. Therefore, this model is particularly relevant in the field of dentistry, as it helps to explain the acquisition of clinical skills and to analyze how factors such as age, sex, year of study, marital status, and place of origin may influence students’ knowledge development and competence in managing NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry within the Peruvian context [19–21].

On the other hand, several studies on pharmacological management knowledge have identified associations with sociodemographic and academic factors. For instance, in Peru, Flores-Montalvo et al. reported that younger age (< 24 years), studying in the capital, and academic year were significantly associated with knowledge levels on pharmacological management in pregnant patients. Similarly, Montuori et al. in Italy found that sex, age, and educational level were associated with consumers’ knowledge of NSAIDs [22,23]. Although these findings do not imply causality, they highlight potential disparities that merit further investigation. Given the limited literature on NSAID use in pediatric dentistry —particularly among dental students in Peru— this study aimed to explore whether sociodemographic and academic factors are associated with Peruvian students’ knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry. The null hypothesis proposed was that there is no association between sociodemographic or academic factors and students’ knowledge in this area.

This cross-sectional, observational, and analytical study was conducted between April and May 2023 at the School of Stomatology of the Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista (UPSJB), Lima, Peru, by the guidelines of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) [24].

The dependent variable in this study was the level of knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry, with “good knowledge” being the category of interest within the regression model. Conversely, the independent variables included age [22], sex [2,22], year of study [2,22], marital status [22], and place of origin [22].

An instrument on knowledge of the management of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in pediatric dentistry [25], previously applied in a study with 30 Peruvian dental students, was adapted. The wording of the questions was improved in such a way as to standardize the answers for each item with Yes/No/Don’t know (See supplementary material). Initially, the content of the 20-items questionnaire was validated by three experienced judges who were specialists in pediatric dentistry, achieving an acceptable Aiken’s V coefficient of 0.83. Subsequently, following a methodological adaptation of the content, the instrument was revalidated by three experienced researchers—a PhD in Dentistry with a specialization in stomatological public health, a PhD in Public Health, and a statistician—yielding an improved Aiken’s V coefficient of 0.87. The 20-item questionnaire was divided into four dimensions: D1: general knowledge about NSAIDs (Q1 - Q3), D2: dosage of NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry (Q4 - Q11), D3: concentration of NSAIDs in oral suspension for pediatric dentistry (Q12 - Q14), and D4: indications and contraindications of NSAIDs (Q15 - Q20). The correct score for each question was 1 point. Based on the principal components factor analysis with Varimax rotation, there were four dimensions. The metrics were good, with a determinant of 0.15, a Kayser-Mayer-Olkin measure of adequacy of 0.73, and Bartlett’s sphericity of < 0.001 [26]. Reliability analysis using Cronbach’s alpha was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62–0.71), which was considered acceptable. The total scores of the 20-item questionnaire were divided into four dimensions were categorized from 0 to 7 points (poor knowledge), 8 to 13 points (fair knowledge), and 14 to 20 points (good knowledge). These categories were established using the Stanones scale [mean total score ± 0.75 (standard deviation)] [22,27]. The cut-off point was set as poor/fair knowledge = 0 and good = 1 to dichotomize the dependent variable and assess the factors associated with the level of good knowledge. Livingston’s K2coefficient validated this cut-off point, yielding an acceptable 0.81.

We shared the 20-item questionnaire was divided into four dimensions in person. For those who could not be reached in person, a link was provided online to connect them to the 20-item questionnaire created on the virtual platform Google Forms®. We shared this link through WhatsApp®three times within a three-week period. The virtual invitation and face-to-face data collection were carried out by the principal investigator (N.A.C). Informed consent was requested prior to participation. In addition, they were provided with the principal investigator’s contact information, and the participant had access to the email address and name of the chairperson of the institutional ethics committee. Participants had the option to reject the invitation or choose not to fill out the 20-item questionnaire if they wished. We stored the data on a secure digital device protected with a password to maintain confidentiality. We accepted only one complete response per student. The virtual survey was designed to accept only one response per associated email address to prevent duplicate responses. Participants did not receive any incentive for their involvement and had access from October 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023.

The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 28.0 was utilized for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were presented as absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative variables, while the mean and standard deviation were reported for the quantitative variable. For bivariable analysis, we applied the chi-square test of homogeneity with Bonferroni correction. For multivariable analysis, a Poisson regression model with robust variance was used, using the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR). Statistical significance was established atp< 0.05.

The Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista approved the research with letter No. 9-2022-CIEI-UPSJB on January 17, 2022. All participants gave their informed consent voluntarily, assuring they would not be exposed to unnecessary physical and psychological risks. This study followed the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki, which include respect, freedom, nonmaleficence, justice, and confidentiality [28].

A total of 381 participants were included in the study. Of these, 58.3% were 25 years old or younger, 59.3% were female, 45.7% were in their fifth year of study, 88.2% were single, and 70.6% were from the capital city (Table1).

A total of 17.6% (95% CI: 13.8–21.4%) of students demonstrated poor knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry. Additionally, 65.1% (95% CI: 60.3–69.9%) and 17.3% (95% CI: 13.5–21.1%) exhibited fair and good levels of knowledge, respectively (Fig.1).

In terms of general knowledge regarding NSAIDs, a significant majority of women (p= 0.014) and fourth and fifth-year students (p< 0.001) answered Q2 incorrectly. Conversely, a significant majority of married students answered Q3 correctly (p= 0.006) (Table2).

Regarding knowledge of NSAIDs dosage in pediatric dentistry, most women answered Q4 significantly correctly (p= 0.005). Most 4th and 5th-year students answered Q5 significantly correctly (p= 0.027). The majority of 5th-year students answered Q8 (p= 0.009), Q9 (p= 0.020), and Q10 (p= 0.003) significantly correctly. The vast majority of married students answered Q9 significantly correctly (p= 0.009), and the vast majority of provincial students answered Q8 significantly correctly (p= 0.023) (Table3).

Regarding knowledge of NSAIDs concentration in oral suspension for pediatric dentistry, the vast majority of married students responded Q12 significantly correctly (p= 0.045) (Table4).

f: frequency, * Based on chi-square of homogeneity (*p< 0.05, significant differences). I: incorrect answer; C: correct answer.

Regarding knowledge of NSAIDs indications and contraindications, the vast majority of married students answered Q15 significantly correctly (p= 0.042). Most 5th-year students answered Q16 (p= 0.001) and Q17 (p= 0.006) significantly correctly. Most females answered Q16 (p= 0.004) significantly correctly. Finally, the vast majority of students aged 25 years or younger and from the 4th year of study answered Q20 (p= 0.001) and Q17 (p= 0.006) significantly incorrectly (Table5).

According to a Poisson regression model with robust variance, using knowledge of NSAID management in pediatric dentistry as the dependent variable (coded as 0 = poor/fair [reference category] and 1 = good [category of interest]), it was observed that the 3rd and 4th year students were 51% and 48% less likely to have a good level of knowledge on the management of NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry, compared to the 5th year students (PR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27–0.90 and PR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.98; respectively). In addition, age group, sex, marital status, and place of origin were not determining factors for good knowledge of NSAID management in pediatric dentistry (p> 0.05) (Table6).

Prescribing medications for pediatric patients has emerged as a critical topic in dental schools, as part of the professional training for stomatology students involves providing healthcare services to children and adolescents. It is essential for these students to possess a thorough understanding of the risks associated with prescribing medications to prevent serious complications, particularly with NSAIDs. These medications can lead to adverse reactions, and in Peru, they are available without a prescription [16,17]. This study aimed to explore whether sociodemographic and academic factors are associated with Peruvian students’ knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry, which led to the rejection of the null hypothesis.

The results of this study indicate that the students’ knowledge level regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry was predominantly fair. This finding differs from those of Requejo-Bustamante and Perona-Miguel de Priego [2], who reported that most of the final-year dental students had insufficient knowledge about the prescription of these medications. This result may be attributed to the fact that the students in this study had a staged clinical training, through courses such as Pediatric Dentistry I (third year), Pediatric Dentistry II (fourth year), and Hospital Internship (fifth year). This curricular structure facilitated the development of competencies to make accurate diagnoses and formulate comprehensive treatment plans that address the specific needs of pediatric patients, as well as to select and administer appropriate pharmacological treatments for children [29]. This specialized training enabled them to develop a robust understanding of pharmacotherapy, equipping them to effectively tackle challenges in clinical practice [29]. However, the proportion of correct answers obtained from the questionnaire shows that knowledge regarding the pharmacological management of NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry was not consistent across all students, even among those in higher academic years. Although these students performed better in several key questions, the pattern was not uniform, suggesting the need to strengthen certain aspects of the curriculum to ensure a more comprehensive and equitable acquisition of competencies in this area. The study conducted by Requejo-Bustamante and Perona-Miguel de Priego [2] revealed that the curricular plan of their students has not been updated since 2011 [30]. It is essential to recognize that regularly updating a curricular plan is vital not only for aligning it with technological advancements and current labor market demands [30], but also for incorporating updated scientific evidence, current clinical guidelines, and improvements in teaching strategies and safe medication management, which are essential for effective and current clinical training. Therefore, curriculum updates should go beyond technological advances in pharmacology to ensure students acquire relevant and up-to-date clinical competencies. Furthermore, social determinants may have influenced the students’ knowledge in the study by Requejo-Bustamante and Perona-Miguel de Priego [2]. The location of their university in a Peruvian province may limit access to educational resources and training opportunities, which in turn could impact educational quality [31]. Additional factors, such as the university’s resources (availability of equipment, access to virtual libraries, information and communication technologies, practical simulators, clinical workshops, teaching provided by specialized professors, constant training, and active methodologies), could also influence the students’ knowledge [18,32]. Moreover, these results differ from those reported by Al Masoudi et al., who found a higher level of knowledge among university students in Jordan. This difference could be explained by the fact that, in Al Masoudi et al.‘s study, a considerable portion of the sample consisted of medical students, who, due to the nature of their training and curriculum content, take more pharmacology-related courses compared to Peruvian dental students, who have a more limited education in this area. Additionally, most of the students in that study were in advanced stages of their studies, and a significant proportion had taken pharmacology courses and were familiar with NSAIDs [33].

In terms of general knowledge about NSAIDs, the vast majority of women and fourth- and fifth-year students answered significantly incorrectly regarding whether the main mechanism of action of NSAIDs is solely to inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme. This result is likely due to the higher frequency of self-medication among women [34–36], which leads to the habitual use of these drugs without a clear understanding of their pharmacological mechanisms. This lack of understanding contributes to incorrect answers about the drugs’ mechanism of action [34,35,37]. The significantly incorrect answers from fourth- and fifth-year students may stem from their heightened focus on practical and clinical aspects compared to third-year students. Final-year students likely prioritize the application of cognitive and technical skills over specific theoretical details, such as the mechanisms of drug action [38,39]. NSAIDs work by blocking cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), which change arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. These prostaglandins are key mediators in inflammatory processes, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin synthesis, NSAIDs relieve pain and inflammation. However, the inhibition of COX-1 may link their use to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects [40].

The results indicated that most students aged 25 or younger, as well as the majority of fourth-year students, incorrectly stated that diclofenac is contraindicated during lactation. This result could be attributed to the fact that younger students and those in their fourth academic year are unfamiliar with its prescription, given its infrequent use in pediatric dentistry [17], which translates into a lack of knowledge of its effects on breastfeeding. Several studies indicate that the use of diclofenac during breastfeeding is safe because low concentrations have been detected in breast milk, which reduces the risk to the infant. In addition, it has a half-life of two hours, and its metabolites are inactive [41,42].

On the other hand, the vast majority of married students answered correctly and significantly regarding the fact that dexamethasone is not an NSAID and that diclofenac should not be administered every 9 h to children. Additionally, they correctly identified the concentration of pediatric ibuprofen oral suspension at 100 mg/5 ml as an indication for inflammatory processes. This result could be related to the fact that many married students are also likely parents, which may motivate them to seek reliable information on child health and, consequently, deepen their knowledge and awareness regarding the use of these medications. However, the underlying reasons why marital status influences pharmacological knowledge are not fully explained by current learning theories, and further research is needed to explore possible social or psychological factors. This information is consistent with what was reported by Al-Akhfash et al. [43], who pointed out that the majority of parents have heard of NSAIDs, a significant proportion have administered them to their children under 14 years old, and approximately one-third are aware of their side effects. In pediatric dentistry, dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties [44,45]; diclofenac is used to prevent and control pain during and after surgery, with a dose of 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day, every 8–12 h [17]; and ibuprofen is one of the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs because it lowers fever, reduces inflammation, relieves pain, and is available in suspension with a concentration of 100 mg/5 ml [17,46].

According to the multivariable regression analysis, third- and fourth-year students were 51% and 48%, respectively, less likely to have a good level of knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry compared to fifth-year students. This variation could be attributed to the fact that third- and fourth-year students have less clinical experience, limited integration of theory and practice, and insufficient training in pediatric pharmacology. In contrast, fifth-year students benefit from increased opportunities to engage with pediatric patients through clinical rotations and hospital internships, where hands-on prescribing experience allows them to develop essential competencies [22,47].

Although the effect size of the Poisson regression model with robust variance was small, the statistical power of the model was adequate given the total number of participants and the number of predictors included. This contributes to the robustness of the findings and supports the reliability of the identified associations. While certain associations reached statistical significance, the model explains only a small portion of the variance in knowledge, indicating that other unmeasured factors may play a substantial role. Another strength of this study is the use of multivariable regression analysis to explore potential factors associated with students’ knowledge of NSAID management in pediatric dentistry, as associations identified through bivariate analysis do not necessarily imply causality or influence [48,49].

The findings of the present study are noteworthy and should be taken into account by faculty members responsible for teaching various subjects in dental education, particularly pharmacology, which is a fundamental component of the dental curriculum. Integrating pharmacology effectively can substantially enhance both the educational quality and the professional development of dental students [22]. In Peru, dental programs currently include courses such as pharmacology, therapeutics, and others like pediatric dentistry and clinical practice, which broadly cover medication use—including NSAIDs—in clinical settings. However, the depth and emphasis of this training can vary significantly between public and private institutions, as well as across different regions of the country, contributing to disparities in students’ knowledge and competencies regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry.

To address these inconsistencies, dental schools could strengthen and update pharmacology and therapeutics curricula by incorporating dedicated modules on the rational use of NSAIDs in children and adolescents. This could include practical workshops, pharmacology-based clinical case discussions, and clinical simulations designed to enable students to apply NSAID management protocols in real or simulated pediatric scenarios [17,50].

In their future professional roles, dental students will assume legal and ethical responsibilities for prescribing drugs—including managing dosages, adverse effects, drug interactions, storage conditions, and contraindications—particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, where pharmacological responses can differ markedly from other life stages [22,51]. NSAIDs are widely used medications with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. However, they are also associated with a range of adverse effects, including skin rashes, gastritis, renal dysfunction, reversible inhibition of platelet function, impaired bone growth and healing, and increased cardiovascular risk [52]. Therefore, it is essential for dental students to be well-trained in both the basic and applied aspects of NSAID prescription to minimize these risks and ensure safe, effective, and responsible care for pediatric patients [52,53].

One limitation of the present study is the lack of existing literature regarding factors associated with the level of knowledge about NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry [2,54], which restricts the ability to compare our findings with those of previous research. Additionally, as a cross-sectional study, we were unable to determine whether the students’ knowledge of NSAID management in pediatric dentistry improved over time. Another limitation is the data collection method; numerous students were surveyed in person, and for those who could not participate in this manner, a link to the virtual form was provided via WhatsApp. To control for non-response bias, the questionnaire was designed in a clear and simple manner, using closed-ended questions, which facilitated both understanding and participation from the respondents. Furthermore, students who did not complete the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation to preserve the validity of the results obtained.

The present study was limited in scope, as it evaluated students from a single university, which restricts the generalizability of the findings to the broader population of dental students in Peru and Latin America. Nevertheless, the results help identify gaps in knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry, particularly during the academic years when clinical courses are undertaken. Future multicenter studies could address this limitation by including institutions with diverse curricula, teaching approaches, and levels of clinical exposure. Such research would allow for the assessment of whether differences in knowledge are shaped by curricular structure or institutional context, thereby enhancing the external validity of the findings. To address the identified knowledge gap, it is essential to strengthen pharmacology training within dental curricula, in alignment with prescription guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health (MINSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). This should involve a comprehensive review and enhancement of existing course content, including the appointment of specialist faculty members with expertise in pediatric dentistry. These educators can play a key role in reinforcing knowledge about the rational use of medications in children, following classification systems such as that of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is recommended that future research include both public and private universities from various regions of the country and Latin America, with different curricula. This would enable more representative and generalizable results, as well as the identification of differences associated with institutional, curricular, and contextual factors in the knowledge and management of NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry. Furthermore, studies should assess whether students have had prior practical exposure to the use of NSAIDs in pediatric dentistry or have participated in related workshops, as these experiences could significantly influence their level of knowledge. Additionally, future research should focus on evaluating the knowledge of postgraduate students from various specialties regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry. Employing multivariable regression models will provide a more thorough assessment of this important topic.

Only a small percentage of dental students demonstrated good knowledge regarding NSAID management in pediatric dentistry. Furthermore, the findings revealed that students in their third and fourth years of study were less likely to possess a good level of knowledge in this area. On the other hand, factors such as age, sex, marital status, and place of origin did not appear to have a significant impact on their knowledge. Therefore, it is recommended to integrate applied pharmacology into real and simulated clinical contexts in the curriculum, as well as to conduct periodic updates to ensure its relevance in relation to scientific advancements and professional demands.
