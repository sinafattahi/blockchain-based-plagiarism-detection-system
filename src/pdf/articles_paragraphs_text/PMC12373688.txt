VEXAS syndrome (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic) is a recently identified clonal disorder caused by somaticUBA1mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, leading to bone marrow failure (BMF) and systemic inflammation. We screened 1771 patients with BMF who underwent unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation in Japan between 1995 and 2020 using multitarget real-time PCR. The diagnoses included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS,n= 1139), myeloproliferative neoplasms (n= 125), plasma cell neoplasms (n= 23), acquired BMF (n= 395), and congenital BMF (n= 89). PathogenicUBA1mutations were detected in two male patients with MDS (aged 48 and 63 years), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.11% in the overall cohort and 0.18% in MDS cases; an additional 70-year-old male was diagnosed outside of the cohort. All three underwent unrelated bone marrow transplantation following fludarabine and busulfan-based conditioning. The first and third patients died of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome 5 and 28 months after transplantation. In the third patient,UBA1-mutant cells persisted at low frequency in skin graft-versus-host disease tissue despite clearance from his blood. The second patient survived without relapse or graft-versus-host disease at 28 months. Although VEXAS syndrome is rare among unrelated HCT recipients with malignant and non-malignant BMF in the historical cohort, HCT is positioned as a potentially curative, yet high-risk strategy. Additional studies are essential to refine patient selection, optimize transplant timing, and improve management strategies to mitigate risk and enhance survival. Therefore, the role of tissue-residualUBA1-mutant clones in post-transplant complications warrants further investigation.

The prevalence of pathogenicUBA1mutations, independent of selection bias for inflammatory symptoms, is approximately 0.02% (1 of 4269) in men and 0.004% (1 of 26,238) in women over 50 years of age.11The prevalence rate among MDS patients is reported to be higher (0.5–1.3%).10,12Data on benign BMF without dysplasia or inflammatory symptoms remain unexplored.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and outcomes of VEXAS syndrome among patients with benign and malignant BMF disorders who underwent unrelated HCT, using historical registry data and archived biological samples.

Patients with MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms, plasma cell neoplasms, and acquired or congenitally benign BMF who underwent unrelated HCT between 1995 and 2020 in Japan were enrolled. Pre-transplant blood DNA and clinical data were sourced from the Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (JDCHCT).37Informed consent for future genetic analyses was obtained from all participants at the time of their registration in the transplant registry. The present study protocol, including the opt-out option, was publicly disclosed on the JDCHCT website in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was granted by the Human Genome/Gene Analysis Research Ethics Committee of Kanazawa University.

A multitarget real-time PCR assay was developed to simultaneously detect three pathogenicUBA1mutations, p.Met41Leu (c.121A > C), p.Met41Val (c.121A > G), and p.Met41Thr (c.122 T > C), along with the wild-typeUBA1. The assay design included a primer pair, three variant-allele-specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes labeled with fluorescein, an LNA probe specific to the wild-typeUBA1allele labeled with SUN fluorochrome, and a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamping probe complementary to wild-typeUBA1. The PNA probe was incorporated to suppress wild-typeUBA1amplification, while enhancing the detection of variant alleles. An analysis was conducted using a QuantStudio Pro 6 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Variant allele fractions (VAFs) were quantified using the QX200 droplet digital PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) or the QuantStudio Absolute Q digital PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the same primers and LNA probes employed in the real-time PCR assay. Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with PNA clamping, as previously described,38using a distinct primer pair and a PNA probe. Sensitivity was validated by serial dilution of the synthesized mutant controls with genomic DNA from a healthy male donor.

The diagnoses included MDS (n= 1139), myeloproliferative neoplasms (n= 125), plasma cell neoplasms (n= 23), acquired BMF (n= 395), and congenital BMF (n= 89). The distributions of the disease type, age, and sex across these diagnoses are summarized in Table1.

A serial dilution analysis established the detection limits for multi-target real-time PCR as follows: 0.13% for p.Met41Leu (c.121A > C), 0.5% for p.Met41Val (c.121A > G), and 0.5–1.0% for p.Met41Thr (c.122 T > C) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

In the cohort study, pathogenicUBA1mutations were identified in two of the 1771 patients (0.11%): p.Met41Val (VAF 1.5%) and p.Met41Leu (VAF 6.9%) (Fig.1).

These low-frequency mutations were undetectable by conventional Sanger sequencing but were subsequently confirmed using PNA clamping. Both patients were male MDS patients of 48 and 63 years of age (Cases 1 and 2, Table2). Additionally, we report another case of VEXAS syndrome with a p.Met41Thr mutation in a patient who underwent unrelated BMT at our hospital in 2022, outside the study period (Case 3).

Based on the 2 registry cases, the prevalence of pathogenicUBA1mutations was 0.18% among MDS patients (2 of 1139) and 0.38% among male MDS patients over 45 years of age (2 of 525).

A 48-year-old man with MDS (increased blasts-1, trisomy 8) received induction chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. The patient underwent BMT from an unrelated female donor who was mismatched at one of the eight HLA loci. Reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and busulfan was administered because of preexisting arrhythmia and cardiac/pulmonary dysfunction. Engraftment with complete donor chimerism was achieved. Post-transplant complications included stage 2 acute skin GVHD, which was resolved without systemic therapy, and varicella zoster virus reactivation, which was treated effectively with acyclovir. However, the patient died five months after BMT due to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome.

A 63-year-old man with MDS (low blasts, normal cytogenetics) achieved a partial hematologic response to azacitidine therapy. Although he developed an invasive fungal infection, he successfully recovered and underwent BMT from an HLA-matched unrelated male donor 29 months after the diagnosis, following myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine and busulfan. Engraftment with complete donor chimerism was also confirmed. The patient remains alive without relapse, GVHD, or major complications at 28 months after BMT.

A 70-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a one-year history of recurrent fever, erythema nodosum of the extremities (Fig.2a), and macrocytic anemia that initially responded to systemic corticosteroid therapy but recurred upon tapering. The patient subsequently became transfusion-dependent for red blood cells and developed progressive thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 × 109/L). Histological examination of the skin biopsy showed lymphocyte-predominant perivascular inflammation in the superficial dermis (Fig.2b, Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). Bone marrow evaluation revealed dysplastic changes with significant vacuolations in myeloid and erythroid precursors (Fig.2c), a blast count of 2.5%, and trisomy 8 in 15 of 20 metaphases, consistent with a diagnosis of MDS with low blasts.

UBA1analyses identified a p.Met41Thr mutation with a VAF of 35% in the peripheral blood (Fig.2d, e). This mutation was predominantly present in myeloid cells (granulocytes and monocytes) but was almost absent in lymphocyte subsets (T cells, B cells, and NK cells; Fig.2f, Supplementary Fig. 3a–f), consistent with previous reports.1A further genomic analysis revealed no myeloid neoplasm-related somatic gene mutations. The sameUBA1mutation was also detected in the skin biopsy specimen, with a VAF of 16% (Supplementary Fig. 3g).

Oral prednisolone at 10 mg/day was required to control the fever and skin lesions but had no hematologic effects. The patient remained transfusion-dependent, requiring red blood cell transfusions approximately every one to two weeks. Eight months after the diagnosis, the patient underwent BMT from an HLA-matched unrelated male donor following reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine, busulfan, and total body irradiation, with continued prednisolone administration (Supplementary Fig. 4). No significant early toxicities occurred after HCT, except for a neutropenic fever due toCorynebacterium jeikeiumbacteremia on day 14, which resolved prior to neutrophil engraftment on day 19.

On day 48, the patient developed grade II acute GVHD with stage 3 skin involvement (Fig.3a, b, Supplementary Fig. 2d), which responded well to an increased prednisolone dose (20 mg/day). During the steroid tapering process, the patient developed pneumocystis pneumonia, Epstein–Barr virus reactivation without rituximab therapy, cytomegalovirus reactivation causing retinitis, and recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which were managed with antibacterial therapy. He ultimately died from respiratory failure secondary to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome 28 months after BMT.

A post-transplant digital PCR analysis of his blood obtained on day 20 and in subsequent assessments up to day 271 demonstrated the complete clearance ofUBA1variant clones (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, the skin biopsy specimen from acute GVHD obtained 48 days after BMT suggested a reduced, but persistent presence ofUBA1-mutant cells, with a VAF of 2.5% (Fig.3c).

Our study is the first to systematically evaluate the prevalence of pathogenicUBA1mutations across a broad range of acquired and inherited BMF disorders in a large nationwide unrelated HCT cohort. We identified pathogenicUBA1mutations in two patients with MDS from the registry cohort as well as a third case diagnosed outside the cohort, all of whom underwent unrelated BMT.

Despite employing a sensitive detection method, the observed prevalence of 0.2% among patients with MDS in our transplant registry was slightly lower than the previously reported rate of 0.5–1.3% but remained significantly higher than that observed in the general population.10–12The low prevalence of VEXAS syndrome in our cohort likely reflects its typical clinical presentation as low-risk MDS in elderly patients who are generally less likely to receive unrelated HCT. Moreover, prior chemotherapy may selectively eliminateUBA1-mutant clones,20–23,26,27,29thereby reducing the detectability of mutations. Indeed, the two cases identified after chemotherapy exhibited low VAFs, which were undetectable by Sanger sequencing.

In addition, we demonstrated that VEXAS syndrome is absent in benign BMF. This finding aligns with previous observations that pathogenicUBA1mutations are associated with distinct clinical features and characteristic bone marrow morphologic changes,1minimizing the likelihood of misdiagnosis as non-malignant BMF.

Based on our findings, routine screening forUBA1mutations may be unnecessary in unrelated HCT recipients. However, testing should be performed with a low threshold in patients with relevant clinical features, such as macrocytic anemia, skin rash, or bone marrow vacuolations, as various targeted therapeutic options are emerging. Furthermore,UBA1mutation screening is simple, rapid, and minimally invasive, as demonstrated in this study.

The skin is the most commonly affected organ in VEXAS syndrome, characterized by leukocytoclastic vasculitis, neutrophilic dermatosis, or perivascular dermatitis,1,42and is also a primary target of GVHD. We hypothesized that residualUBA1-mutant cells in the skin, such as macrophages, contribute to localized inflammation that mimics or triggers GVHD and other transplant complications. Indeed, we confirmed the persistence of these clones in the skin GVHD tissue specimens. These findings not only suggest that targeted therapies againstUBA1-mutant clones, such as Janus kinase pathway inhibitors or hypomethylating agents, could offer clinical benefit in managing post-transplant complications but also raise the possibility that idiopathic pneumonia syndromes, the causes of death in two cases, may be attributed to persistentUBA1-mutant clones in the lung tissue, although autopsies were not performed in these patients.

At the time of clinical decision making for Case 3, no treatment had demonstrated proven efficacy for VEXAS syndrome, except for several case reports of successful HCT. Because the patient had severe anemia and thrombocytopenia and an HLA-matched unrelated donor was available, HCT was selected as the most appropriate treatment option.

Experience with HCT for VEXAS syndrome has largely been limited to small case series,43,44and prospective trials are currently underway.45Infection is the primary cause of post-HCT mortality, likely due to immunosuppression resulting from prior corticosteroid therapy and lymphopenia or dysfunctional immune responses associated with VEXAS syndrome itself.46–48Additionally, theUBA1p.Met41Val mutation may correlate with severe infections and worse outcomes.5,46In our study, one deceased patient carried the p.Met41Val mutation and another had undergone prolonged corticosteroid therapy both before and after transplantation, both of whom developed opportunistic infections and subsequently died from idiopathic pneumonia syndromes.

Our multi-target real-time PCR method provides substantial practical advantages over conventional detection techniques. It is simple, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and compatible with the widely available two-color real-time PCR systems. Additionally, the short amplicon length enables the analysis of fragmented DNA from older archival samples such as paraffin-embedded tissues or bone marrow smears, as demonstrated in our skin tissue analysis, which can be challenging for traditional sequencing methods.

Despite its strengths, our method has several limitations. Accurately quantifying VAFs without digital PCR is difficult, and confirmatory analyses using either single-probe PCR or Sanger sequencing are required to identify the mutation type. Furthermore, our assay did not target minorUBA1variants outside the methionine-41 codon, such as splice site mutations, which account for approximately 4–7% of VEXAS syndrome cases.8,12,13,15,49–53Future improvements may include multiplexing with multiple fluorochromes and additional targets or incorporating digital PCR from the initial diagnostic stage.

In conclusion, although VEXAS syndrome is rare among unrelated HCT recipients with malignant and non-malignant BMF disorders in the historical cohort, HCT is positioned as a potentially curative, yet high-risk strategy. Additional studies are essential to refine patient selection, optimize transplant timing, and improve management strategies to mitigate risks and enhance survival. The role of tissue-residualUBA1-mutant clones in post-transplant complications therefore warrants further investigation.
