SCORE2-Diabetes estimates 10-year risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), categorizing individuals according to low (<5%), moderate (5% to <10%), high (10% to <20%), or very high (≥20%) risk (1). However, it does not account for other nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes such as heart failure (HF) or atrial fibrillation (AF) (2). We investigated whether SCORE2-Diabetes also predicts HF and AF in newly diagnosed T2D.

We included all T2D patients newly diagnosed between 2006 and 2015 in the Swedish National Diabetes Register (n= 121,135) and followed them for HF and AF until 2016. SCORE2-Diabetes was calculated at the first recorded visit (baseline), and patients with complete data were included (n= 69,846). After exclusion of individuals <40 years old or with established cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease), the final population comprised 54,851 individuals. Information on comorbidities and HF/AF outcomes was retrieved from the National Patient Register (NPR). HF was defined according to ICD-10 codes I50, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2, I25.5, K76.1, I42, or I43 and AF I48. Individuals with prior HF (n= 2,788) or AF (n= 4,890) were excluded from the respective analyses.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for HF and AF. Proportionality assumptions were verified with Schoenfeld residuals, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to depict cumulative incidence. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell’s C-index for time-to-event outcomes, and calibration was evaluated using decile-based plots comparing observed versus predicted risks (3). Statistical analyses were performed with STATA, version 18.

Of the 54,851 patients, 8.8% were categorized low risk, 28.0% moderate risk, 48.6% high risk, and 14.7% very high risk. Higher-risk groups were older and predominantly male, with worse cardiovascular profiles and more microvascular complications. During follow-up, 3,826 HF and 4,473 AF cases occurred. Cumulative incidence of HF and AF across different risk groups is presented inFig. 1.

Cumulative incidence and HRs for HF (A) and AF (B) with stratification by risk group according to SCORE2-Diabetes.

In comparisons with the group with low risk, HRs for HF were 2.6 (95% CI 1.8–3.7) for those with moderate risk, 6.0 (4.2–8.5) for high risk, and 15.6 (11.0–22.3) for very high risk (Fig. 1). For AF, HRs were 1.9 (1.5–2.6) for moderate risk, 5.0 (3.8–6.6) for high risk, and 9.7 (7.3–12.8) for very high risk, respectively (Fig. 1). SCORE2-Diabetes showed moderate discrimination with C-indices of 0.678 for HF and 0.659 for AF. Calibration plots indicated a linear relationship between observed and predicted risks, although the observed risks were lower than predicted.

For independent replication, we used a different cohort of 228,509 Swedish patients with T2D with a median diabetes duration of 6 years (interquartile range 2–12). Results were consistent: HRs for HF were 2.4 (95% CI 2.1–2.8) for moderate risk, 6.7 (5.8–7.7) for high risk, and 18.5 (16.0–21.3) for very high risk. For AF, HRs were 2.8 (2.4–3.2) for moderate risk, 7.2 (6.3–8.3) for high risk, and 14.6 (12.7–16.7) for very high risk. C-indices were 0.700 for HF and 0.667 for AF, confirming the robustness of the findings. Calibration plots also showed a linear relationship between observed and predicted risks, with excellent calibration for AF and slightly lower observed risks than predicted for HF.

Notably, approximately two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed T2D were classified as high or very high risk. Compared with the risk for those in the low-risk group, risk of HF for those in the high-risk and very-high-risk groups was increased by up to 16-fold and of AF up to 10-fold. These findings suggest that SCORE2-Diabetes, though originally developed to predict classic atherosclerotic events, also effectively identifies individuals at risk for broader cardiovascular complications. Given that SCORE2-Diabetes includes age and sex—both strong predictors of HF and AF—some degree of risk discrimination was anticipated. Nevertheless, the clear gradient of HF and AF risk across SCORE2-Diabetes categories, consistently observed in two large cohorts, underscores its broader prognostic utility.

Current guidelines from diabetes and cardiology societies emphasize the need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk stratification, including screening for AF and HF (4,5). The 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines (5) recommend GLP-1 receptor agonists and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for patients identified to be at high and very high risk with use of SCORE2-Diabetes. Our results support SCORE2-Diabetes as a practical tool for identifying individuals who may benefit from early initiation of therapies such as sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown efficacy across a range of cardiovascular outcomes, including reducing the risk of HF and AF.

In conclusion, SCORE2-Diabetes predicts not only cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke but also HF and AF in newly diagnosed T2D. Its application in clinical practice can improve risk stratification, screening, and targeted interventions.
