To understand current practices and identify barriers and facilitators to implementing guideline-recommended core osteoarthritis (OA) treatments in China.

Public and private clinical institutions across mainland China.

A total of 498 healthcare professionals participated. The qualitative phase included semistructured interviews (n=15) and a qualitative survey (n=181). The quantitative phase consisted of a survey with 302 respondents across 19 provinces, representing seven health professions.

Five themes identified as barriers during the qualitative phase: misconceptions about OA; limitations in current medical insurance policies; insufficient multidisciplinary collaboration; lack of workplace support and low patient adherence to self-management. Three themes identified as facilitators: telehealth and community-based delivery pathways; professional training and patient education resources; and personalised services with positive feedback. Quantitative findings showed that physical agent therapy (56%) and traditional Chinese medicine (22%) were the most frequently used OA treatments, while exercise therapy was implemented in only 9% of cases. The average OA knowledge score was 31.2 (±8.9) out of 55, with the lowest self-rated confidence in interdisciplinary collaboration (3.4±0.1, ‘somewhat confident’). The most applicable factors impacting the implementation of core OA treatments included patient comorbidities, knowledge of pain science and exercise therapy, and financial support (all 2.8±0.8, ‘applicable’).

The uptake of core OA treatments in China remains suboptimal, constrained by limitations in insurance coverage, workforce capacity and interdisciplinary integration. Enhancing telehealth accessibility, strengthening professional training and refining policy incentives may help bridge this evidence-practice gap and improve OA management in China.

The study employs a mixed-methods design, integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide comprehensive insights into the unique challenges within China’s healthcare system, which can inform locally relevant interventions.

The inclusion of various healthcare professionals, including rehabilitation specialists, general practitioners and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, enhances the generalisability of the findings and ensures diverse perspectives on osteoarthritis management.

The study highlights China-specific healthcare system challenges, offering novel insights not covered in international literature.

Limited representation of certain specialties, such as orthopaedic surgeons, may affect the comprehensiveness of the clinical perspectives captured.

Given these challenges, this study aims to: (1) identify the barriers and facilitators experienced by Chinese healthcare professionals in implementing core OA treatments and (2) understand the current clinical practices in OA management within the Chinese clinical context.

Participants in this study were selected based on the healthcare professionals targeted by Chinese clinical guidelines for OA. To ensure representation of diverse specialties contributing to OA care, healthcare professionals managing OA across mainland China were recruited without limitations on specific disciplines or institutions. Demographic variables of participants were collected for all phases, including the type of medical institution (public or private), professional specialty, years of professional experience, OA-related certifications or qualifications, and other relevant information. The detailed selection process for participants in each phase is summarised below.

This phase aimed to initially explore the barriers and facilitators to implementing exercise therapy for patients with OA.

Participants: Participants at this phase were recruited through professional networks, including direct email invitations, messages shared in professional WeChat groups, and personal contacts, between September 2023 and November 2023. Inclusion criteria required participants to have a minimum of 2 years of clinical experience in OA-related care and without conflict of interests with the research group. Potential participants were screened via phone call to confirm their professional background and the frequency with which they managed OA patients. During the recruitment, we confirmed that all participants regularly treated OA patients, with most reporting a caseload of at least one OA patient per week. We purposively recruited healthcare professionals with diverse roles, geographical locations and institutional affiliations to ensure variation in clinical experience and practice settings. There were no further exclusion criteria.

Data collection: For phase 1, we approached 20 clinicians and of these, 15 agreed to participate, 5 declined due to scheduling conflicts. Data saturation was achieved after the 13th interview, with two additional interviews confirming no new themes. The interviews were guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), which offers a structured approach to examining behavioural determinants in healthcare,40with minor adaptations to question wording to better reflect the context of OA management in China. Interview questions were designed to elicit in-depth responses on participants’ experiences with implementing evidence-based OA practices, barriers encountered and strategies perceived as facilitators in their clinical settings. The interview guide was included in theonline supplemental material 1and was reviewed by two OA experts and one qualitative research specialist to ensure content validity, cultural appropriateness and alignment with the TDF. Individual interviews were conducted by a trained qualitative researcher (ZW), either in person or via online meetings depending on availability. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim by ZW. Field notes were taken during and after the interviews to capture contextual details. Each interview lasted approximately 40 min.

Data analysis: We analysed the data using framework analysis,41facilitating the systematic organisation of data into themes that reflected participants’ clinical experiences and perspectives. Two researchers (XC and SD) independently coded the transcripts using NVivo software (V.14). Coding consistency was maintained through iterative comparison of codes, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion until agreement was reached, with arbitration by a third researcher (ZW) when necessary. ZW mapped the finalised themes deductively to the domains of the TDF. Recruitment continued until data saturation was achieved, defined as the point at which no new themes were identified in subsequent interviews. To minimise potential bias from the research team’s clinical backgrounds, all coding decisions and theme interpretations were discussed collaboratively to ensure interpretations remained grounded in participants’ narratives.

This phase aimed to validate and complement the findings from individual interviews, and to inform the design of further quantitative survey.

Participants: Participants for this phase were recruited through flyers with QR code linking to the survey, which were posted in professional WeChat groups for healthcare practitioners, public accounts of national professional societies (eg, rehabilitation, geriatric, orthopaedics), and networks across hospitals, community and private sectors from November 2023 to January 2024. The sample size for this phase was determined using the principle of data saturation, whereby recruitment ceased when no new themes or patterns were identified from the open-ended responses.

Data collection: An online qualitative survey with open-ended questions was conducted to expand the sample size and capture perspectives from a broader group of practitioners across various disciplines in China. Exercise-focused items were prioritised in the survey because phase 1 identified exercise implementation as the most prominent gap in core OA treatments. In addition to demographic questions, participants were asked to respond to several key questions: (1) ‘What factors hinder your delivery of exercise-based therapies for your OA patients?’; (2) ‘What factors facilitate your delivery of exercise-based therapies for your OA patients?’ These were followed by a non-mandatory question: (3) ‘If you do not agree with exercise-based therapies, please provide the reasons behind your decision’. Lastly, participants were asked: (4) ‘What are your usual treatment options for your OA patients?’ and (5) ‘What are your main treatment principles/goals when selecting treatments for your OA patients?’ Participants were required to provide their answers in written text. In phase 2, around 300 practitioners received the qualitative survey invitation, with 181 completing it (response rate 60%).

Data analysis: Two researchers (XC and SD) independently conducted the analysis using summative and deductive content analysis. Summative content analysis was used to quantify the frequency of key terms and patterns within responses, while deductive content analysis involved categorising responses into predefined themes derived from the research questions and theoretical frameworks. This combined approach ensured both thematic frequency and theoretical depth, which are suitable for analysing large amounts of open-ended survey data.42 43Summative content analysis identified and quantified key terms and patterns related to barriers, facilitators and treatment options for OA. Deductive content analysis then categorised responses into predefined themes derived from the research questions and theoretical frameworks. NVivo software was used to manage and organise data, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. A senior researcher (ZW) reviewed the final themes to ensure validity and reliability.

This phase aimed to evaluate the applicability of the themes and common practices identified in the qualitative phase by quantifying the most frequently mentioned themes and the most common OA practices in clinical settings.

Participants: Participants in this phase were recruited using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling from February 2024 to May 2024. The sample size was determined based on descriptive results reported in a similar international study,25which reported barriers related to knowledge and skills with proportions ranging from 37% to 88%. At a 95% confidence level, a minimum sample size of 141 was calculated for adequate precision. To allow for subgroup analyses and greater accuracy, a more conservative estimate with a maximum variability of 50% and a 5% margin of error resulted in a required sample size of up to 384 participants.

Bespoke questions about core OA treatment usage: Respondents answered four questions using a 5-point Likert scale to indicate the frequency of implementing exercise, education, weight management and support for self-health management. The response options were: ‘never’, ‘occasionally’, ‘half of the time’, ‘often’ and ‘always’. Higher scores for each question indicate a higher frequency of implementation, with scores calculated separately for each question.

Factors impacting the implementation of best practices: Respondents evaluated the applicability of factors impacting best practice implementation using a matrix question with four response options: ‘not applicable’, ‘somewhat applicable’, ‘applicable’ and ‘highly applicable’. These factors included time allocation, team-based care, resource availability, guideline accessibility and patient-related factors, among others.

Chinese version of the OAKS44: This scale assesses respondents’ knowledge of OA management. It consists of 11 items, each rated on a 5-point Likert scale: ‘false’, ‘possibly false’, ‘unsure’, ‘possibly true’ and ‘true’. The total score ranges from 11 to 55, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge about OA.

Items evaluating self-reported confidence in OA care: Based on the OA core capability framework,45respondents rated their confidence in 13 specific capabilities using a 5-point Likert scale: ‘not confident at all’ (1 point), ‘not very confident’ (2 points), ‘somewhat confident’ (3 points), ‘confident’ (4 points) and ‘very confident’ (5 points).

Data analysis: Data were analysed using RStudio (V.4.2.0). Descriptive statistics were applied to summarise demographic characteristics, frequencies and proportions of the quantitative responses. All data were anonymised, with informed consent provided on the opening page, and securely stored, and accessible only to the research team.

The detailed demographic characteristics, including their professional backgrounds of the participants for all three phases, are summarised intable 1. Detailed individual-level demographic characteristics for phase 1 participants (semistructured interviews, n=15) are presented inonline supplemental material 3.

In this initial phase, four themes were identified as barriers and five as facilitators using framework analysis, with the detailed findings presented according to the major TDF domains.

Participants frequently reported challenges in accessing and integrating evidence-based guidelines. Many described a reliance on traditional practices or personal experiences due to a lack of formal training and regular updates. This issue was particularly pronounced in resource-limited settings.

Insufficient time, funding and infrastructure were recurring themes that limited the delivery of evidence-based care. Participants highlighted issues such as low reimbursement rates for exercise therapies and a lack of dedicated rehabilitation facilities.

Resistance to exercise-based interventions, particularly among surgical and pharmaceutical-focused health professionals, was identified as a significant barrier. This scepticism often stemmed from a preference for quicker or more invasive solutions.

Misunderstanding the role of exercise in OA management was a significant patient-level barrier. Participants noted that many patients associated exercise with potential joint damage or pain, leading to poor adherence to prescribed therapies.

Structured training programmes and peer mentoring were recognised as essential for building confidence and competence in implementing evidence-based practices.

The integration of telehealth platforms, mobile applications and exercise videos was highlighted as a valuable facilitator, particularly in under-resourced settings. These tools enhanced patient education and adherence by providing accessible and visual guidance to improve patient understanding of exercise programmes.

Support from healthcare institutions, such as prioritising rehabilitation services and providing financial incentives for non-surgical interventions, was seen as a crucial facilitator.

Multidisciplinary collaboration was frequently cited as a facilitator for implementing OA care. Teams that included physicians, therapists and support staff were more likely to achieve consistent and effective care delivery.

Effective communication strategies are considered key drivers in improving patient adherence and treatment outcomes. Participants emphasised the importance of tailoring the content of information according to the needs of individual patients, using simple, empowering language and success stories to motivate patients and strengthen the doctor-patient alliance.

The identified barriers and facilitators were organised into themes based on the relevant TDF domains to ensure a structured analysis.Table 2presents examples of barriers and facilitators mapped to each domain.

The qualitative survey (n=181) largely validated the barriers and facilitators identified in phase 1, while also providing additional insights. For instance, within the ‘Beliefs About Consequences’ domain, participants highlighted that patients’ unrealistic high expectations regarding the speed of symptom relief often led to frustration and early discontinuation of exercise. This finding extended the earlier observations about misconceptions related to exercise. For the ‘Environmental Context’ domain, participants identified a lack of localised easily understood educational resources tailored to rural populations with low education levels, which exacerbated existing disparities in access to evidence-based care. Within the ‘Social/Professional Role’ domain, participants emphasised the importance of clearer task/responsibility allocation and more defined roles within multidisciplinary teams as a facilitator. Additionally, within the ‘Reinforcement’ domain, respondents highlighted the value of incorporating real-world examples of successful delivery to motivate and inspire both patients and healthcare professionals.

Synthesising the findings from phase 1 and phase 2, five themes were identified as key barriers based on their frequency and relevance. These included widespread misconceptions about OA among patients, healthcare professionals and society at large; limitations in medical insurance policies for non-pharmaceutical services alongside broader economic constraints; insufficient multidisciplinary collaboration with unclear task allocation; a lack of workplace support; and low patient adherence to self-management strategies. Similarly, three themes were identified as facilitators. These included the potential of telehealth and community-based delivery models, the availability of professional training and patient education resources, and the implementation of personalised services supported by positive delivery feedback.

Analysis of the text-based responses identified five frequently mentioned themes representing the goals of OA treatment. These themes include pain management, aimed at alleviating patient discomfort; functional recovery and muscle enhancement to improve joint mobility and strength; repair and nourishment techniques focused on cartilage and joint health; anti-inflammatory and swelling reduction strategies; and maintaining overall health through behavioural and lifestyle interventions.

Usual care for OA was also categorised into five main treatment approaches based on the responses. These included physical modality therapies, such as electrotherapy, ultrasound and similar modalities; TCM practices, including acupuncture and herbal treatments; exercise therapies, emphasising joint mobilisation, functional training and strengthening exercises; pharmacological treatments, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucosamine; and injection therapies, including corticosteroids and platelet-rich plasma.

Participants from 19 provinces in China completed the quantitative survey, with Fujian province accounting for half of the total respondents. As shown intable 1, only 33% of participants completing the survey held a relevant professional healthcare qualification. Among these, 70% held a specialist certification, while the remaining 30% held a physician’s licence. The most commonly used OA treatments were physical agent therapy (56%) and TCM (22%), while exercise therapy was used in only 9% of cases. Pharmaceutical treatments and injections accounted for 8% and 4%, respectively.

The most frequently reported frequency of managing OA patients in clinical practice was reported as ‘often/at least once per week’. More than half of the participants reported a delivery frequency of no more than ‘half of the time’ for exercise/physical activity (73.2%), patient education (65.5%) and self-management support (68.2%). The average OA knowledge score was 31.2 (SD=8.9) out of 55, with 96% of the participants believing that joints wear down with daily use (mean score=2.1, out of 5), while the role of scans in diagnosing OA was rated the lowest (mean score=2.0). Among the 13 domains of the OARSI core capability framework, self-rated confidence was lowest for ‘referrals and interdisciplinary collaboration’ (mean score=3.4, ‘somewhat confident’), with none of the domains reaching the level of 4 (‘confident’).

Guided by themes and codes from the qualitative results, we identified the most relevant factors that participants believe impact the implementation of core OA care in their practice, using a 4-point Likert scale (ranging from ‘not at all applicable’ to ‘highly applicable’).Table 3presents the average rating of each factor, sorted in descending order from high to low.

Many factors were rated highly including: patient comorbidities (such as obesity, mental health problems and other chronic diseases) (2.8±0.8); patient knowledge of pain science (2.8±0.8) and exercise therapy (2.8±0.8); financial support for both practitioners (2.8±0.8) and patients (2.7±0.9); multidiscipline networks and referral systems (2.7); patient access to appropriate care and support (2.7) and the time available for each consultation (2.7). Personal bias towards guidelines (1.9) and practices of other working colleagues (1.8) was rated as less applicable.

The quantitative results demonstrated strong alignment with the qualitative results. For example, patient misconceptions, resource constraints and insufficient multidisciplinary collaboration—initially identified in interviews—were also among the highest-rated factors in the quantitative survey. Similarly, facilitators such as professional training and telehealth solutions were consistently supported by both qualitative and quantitative findings.

This study is the first to identify Chinese healthcare professionals’ views on the barriers and facilitators to implementing core OA treatments (exercise, patient education and weight management) through a mixed-methods design. It also explored usual OA clinical practices in Chinese healthcare settings and professionals’ confidence levels in relevant core capabilities. The findings provide a solid basis for informing further interventions to optimise high-value OA health service delivery in China.

Similar to findings from other countries worldwide,16 46 47OA management in China remains suboptimal, with few healthcare professionals actively delivering first-line core treatments. Instead, physical modality therapy (eg, electrotherapy) and TCM were the most commonly used approaches among the participants in our study. A report published in 201348highlighted that physical therapy in China was dominated by these two treatments at that time, suggesting little change in OA clinical practice over this time. A similar trend of little change over a decade was observed among Australian general practitioners (GPs).46Our findings also revealed that most participants, including many rehabilitation specialists, lacked confidence in their ability to deliver recommended OA treatments. In contrast, a multinational (Australia, New Zealand, Canada) interprofessional study49found that all disciplines, except nurses, reported moderate levels of confidence. This discrepancy may highlight a gap in confidence among our participants. A validated OA Knowledge questionnaire revealed a low level of knowledge in our sample of healthcare professionals in China, showing certain bias and misconceptions towards OA concepts and management that have also been observed in other countries.50Given existing evidence-practice gaps in current OA practices in China, it is important to develop strategies to optimise the timely use of core treatments, by addressing the barriers and facilitators identified.

Our exploratory sequential design demonstrated convergence across phases. Themes from the qualitative phases informed the development of the quantitative survey items, while quantitative results provided back-validation and a measure of the prevalence of these barriers and facilitators. This iterative approach ensured that the findings were both grounded in real-world experiences and generalisable across a larger sample. The barriers and facilitators identified in this study are mainly consistent with those observed in other countries, which typically fall into three meta-themes: personal factors (including both patients and healthcare professionals, knowledge/skills), workforce environment (resources and training), and system-level factors (society and policy).24 25 51For example, the most frequently mentioned and common barrier identified in this study was the widespread misconceptions about OA and exercise therapy among society, patients and healthcare professionals, which is a common issue worldwide. Therefore, China should develop knowledge dissemination initiatives, such as a toolkit52with essential components and practical resources for healthcare professionals and patients.

Environment-level barriers identified in this study are shaped by China’s unique healthcare context. First, restrictions in medical insurance policies for non-pharmaceutical services have led to insufficient funding support for rehabilitation within the healthcare system. The identified issue of multidisciplinary collaboration by our participants is also tied to the limited influence of rehabilitation departments in public hospitals, making referral systems and the role of first assessors/first contact practitioners focused on conservative treatments less effective. This aligns somewhat with a study53in Australia, which found that the likelihood of GPs referring patients to physiotherapists is low for certain health conditions. As the first assessor often plays a central role in managing OA,35optimising referrals to rehabilitation-led care could be an important way to promote better patient health outcomes. In public hospitals, exercise-based services bring minimal financial incentives, thus rehabilitation departments focus more on TCM than on exercise interventions, which makes organisational leadership support for exercise-based therapies essential.

Facilitators identified in this study highlight the potential importance of telehealth and CHCs. As CHCs have gradually become major primary care providers in China, and OA is a complex chronic health condition requiring long-term self-management support, developing a community-based model of OA care in the future could help alleviate outpatient workload stress in public hospitals.54Regarding the use of telehealth in OA care, recent evidence55has shown that telerehabilitation with a physiotherapist can be as effective as in-person care for the non-surgical management of OA. Improving access to core treatments is particularly important, as there is a persistent shortage of rehabilitation specialists in China, and the uneven distribution of rehabilitation resources remains a significant challenge.33Most rehabilitation resources are concentrated in large cities and hospitals, while rural and underdeveloped areas lack sufficient rehabilitation services, even though symptomatic knee OA is more common in rural China.56Telehealth, therefore, has the potential to bridge this gap and make core treatments more accessible to underserved populations. To facilitate its implementation, relevant training programmes should be continuously provided for Chinese to upskill their telehealth knowledge and practices.

This study has several limitations. First, due to the network recruitment process, participants in the quantitative phase were primarily rehabilitation doctors and therapists from Fujian province, which may introduce certain perspective biases, as surgeons or orthopaedic doctors might hold different views. Additionally, Fujian, particularly its capital city Xiamen, is a sports-friendly city with strong government support for exercise, which could further influence responses. However, in the preceding qualitative phase, participants were more evenly distributed. Second, different healthcare work environments may present distinct barriers, potentially influencing participants’ beliefs. Since we did not collect detailed information about their specific workplaces, we cannot ensure that the participants’ work settings were evenly represented. Third, this study focused primarily on the management of OA, without addressing other chronic diseases or cases with multiple comorbidities. Finally, we did not collect cost-related economic data in this study, as most participants lacked access to their institutions’ health insurance systems. This aspect will be targeted in future interventional studies.

Core OA treatments are infrequently implemented in China, reflecting significant evidence-practice gaps. Targeted efforts are needed to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration, develop adaptive Chinese OA educational resources for all stakeholders, and provide systematic workplace support for practitioners. Improving accessibility through innovative approaches such as telehealth and community-based care is particularly critical for addressing disparities in resource-limited areas. Future interventions addressing these gaps will optimise evidence-based OA care delivery and improve patient outcomes in China.
