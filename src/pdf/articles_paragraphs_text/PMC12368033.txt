Precise evaluation of ecosystem service value (ESV) under climate variability is essential for supporting regional ecological management. This study has improved the equivalent factor method. This method takes into account local factors such as temperature, precipitation, net primary productivity (NPP), and tourism revenue, and dynamically adjusts the equivalent coefficient for Longyan City (a humid subtropical area in China). The Equivalent Factor Method after Improvement (EFMAI) is evaluated against the Functional Value Method (FVM) and the baseline Equivalent Factor Method before Improvement (EFMBI), using statistical indicators such as R², RMSE, and Theil’s U. Results indicate that EFMAI substantially improves the accuracy of regulation and cultural service estimations, aligning closely with FVM outputs. Specifically, ESV changes from 2010 to 2020 show that regulation services contributed 47.6% of the total increase, followed by cultural services (29.4%), while supply services remained relatively stable, reflecting stronger dependence on exogenous socio-economic factors. Despite these improvements, EFMAI does not consistently outperform EFMBI in supply services due to the limited responsiveness of biophysical models to economic and institutional variables. Moreover, cultural service discrepancies arise from differences in measurement basis: EFMAI employs tourism income, whereas FVM uses site-specific visitation data. Given these limitations, the method provides a more nuanced tool for service valuation in policy-oriented regions similar to China and contributes to methodological advancements in climate-adjusted ESV assessment.

The valuation of ecosystem service value (ESV) is a core tool for quantifying natural capital and coordinating ecological conservation with sustainable development, particularly critical amid global climate change and ecological governance transitions. Accurately quantifying the value of ecosystem services helps inform policies for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land-use planning. Traditional frameworks, such as the unit-area equivalent factor method proposed by Costanza et al.1, have facilitated cross-regional comparisons through standardized value classification. However, they often lack responsiveness to climatic dynamics (e.g., temperature, precipitation, net primary productivity [NPP] changes) and regional ecological processes. Internationally, methodologies like the InVEST model2, ARIES framework3, and TEEB initiative4have emerged, each offering strengths in quantifying spatial heterogeneity and trade-offs among ecosystem services. Yet, these models still struggle with representing the dynamic impacts of climate variables on services such as carbon sequestration, water regulation, and cultural values5. This limitation is particularly evident in subtropical monsoon regions, where temperature variations and precipitation patterns directly affect ecosystem functioning6. For instance, although the InVEST model can assess carbon storage services, it lacks direct quantification of the temperature-driven plant transpiration cooling effect2; the TEEB framework relies on market proxy indicators (such as tourism revenue), but fails to fully incorporate the indirect influence of climate factors on cultural services (such as the driving effect of climate comfort on ecotourism)4. In China, improvements to the equivalent factor method by Xie et al.7,8—incorporating NPP and precipitation adjustments—have enhanced regional assessment accuracy. However, in subtropical monsoon climates, the complex impacts of temperature changes on carbon cycling, vegetation growth, and scenic landscapes remain underrepresented. Climate-driven processes, such as carbon cycling and plant transpiration, are often underrepresented in current models, leading to the undervaluation of regulatory services like climate regulation9. As a result, there is a growing need for localized approaches that incorporate both climatic and socio-economic factors, such as tourism income, which directly affect service values in regions with significant tourism development10. This study aims to fill these gaps by introducing an equivalent factor method (EFMAI) that combines climate and tourism factors. This method has been calibrated specifically for Longyan City in southern China. As a subtropical forest region, Longyan has experienced significant climate changes in recent decades, including rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, which have affected the local ecosystem and services. Moreover, the region’s increasing reliance on ecotourism as a major economic driver requires a comprehensive assessment framework that can simultaneously capture ecosystem services affected by climate and cultural services related to tourism. The calibration of the EFMAI method is to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystem service value (ESV) in the Longyan area by combining temperature, net primary productivity (NPP), and precipitation with tourism revenue data, providing a more regionally specific tool for local decision-making. The findings presented in this paper aim to guide ecological compensation policies and climate adaptation strategies in regions similar to Longyan, and also offer insights into China’s contribution to global climate-sensitive ESV assessment, in line with the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)11,12.

Longyan City is located in the west of Fujian Province (latitude 24°23’ − 26°02’, longitude 115°51’ − 117°45’). As the core area of the western mountainous region of Fujian and the source of the Minjiang River, Jiulongjiang River, and Tingjiang River, it is an important ecological barrier in Fujian Province and a typical area rich in “green mountains and clear waters” resources13. Figure1presents the location and land use types of Longyan City. The total area of the region is 19,028 square kilometers. It is mainly composed of low mountains and hills (accounting for 78.1%), with an altitude ranging from 100 to 1,548 m14. It has a subtropical monsoon climate, with an average annual temperature of 18.7℃ and an annual precipitation of 1,637 mm. The water and heat conditions are abundant, and the forest coverage rate reaches 76.2%15. It has important ecological nodes such as the Meihua Mountain National Nature Reserve. The ecosystem is mainly composed of forests (accounting for 74.21%), farmland (9.95%), and water bodies (0.53%) (in 2020), featuring the typical complexity of a mountainous ecosystem and diversity of service function.

Location and land use types of Longyan City, China. The base map was generated using 30-m resolution land use remote sensing data (2008–2020) from the Resources and Environment Science Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences16. Land use types were classified into 6 major categories and 13 subcategories following the Land Use Classification standard (GB/T 21010–2017)17, and spatial analysis and map visualization were performed using ArcGIS 10.8 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA;https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview).

Land Use Data: 30-m resolution remote sensing data (2008–2020) from the Resources and Environment Science Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences16were classified into 6 major categories and 13 subcategories following the Land Use Classification standard (GB/T 21010–2017)17. Spatial analysis was performed using ArcGIS 10.8, with field validation confirming a classification accuracy of 92.3%18. NPP and Meteorological Data: Annual net primary productivity (NPP) data (1 km resolution, 2008–2020) were derived from MODIS MOD17A3HGF products via Google Earth Engine (GEE)19. Daily temperature and precipitation data were obtained from the National Meteorological Science Data Center and interpolated to 1 km grids using Kriging, achieving a cross-validation error of ± 5%20. Socioeconomic Data: Crop yields, prices, and tourism income were sourced from the Longyan Statistical Yearbook (2009–2021)21and National Compilation of Agricultural Product Cost and Revenue Data22. Land use classification accuracy was validated using 200 field samples, yielding a Kappa coefficient of 0.8923. MODIS NPP data showed a strong correlation (R² = 0.87) with flux tower measurements, and interpolated meteorological data had an average absolute error ≤ 3% compared to station observations24.

Based on the above conclusion and considering other methods, temperature, as an ecological factor, plays a dominant role in the value of climate regulation services, but traditional equivalent factors are based on national averages. Thus, we define a temperature spatiotemporal adjustment factor () as the ratio of the average temperature of land use type i in year j to the national average temperature.

ESVj: Total Ecosystem Service Value in year j (CNY).

The spatiotemporal dynamics of secondary ecosystem service value (ESV) in Longyan City from 2008 to 2020 (Table2.) reveal a complex interplay of climatic factors, land-use changes, economic transitions, and policy interventions. Soil conservation service value surged by 263.41%, rising from 23.06 billion CNY to 83.81 billion CNY, strongly correlated with the Grain-for-Green Program (GGP) and soil–water conservation projects. This trend aligns with studies showing GGP-driven vegetation restoration significantly reduces soil erosion nationally30,31. Notably, Longyan’s increase exceeds national averages, indicating localized policy efficacy. To isolate policy impacts, a counterfactual comparison with nearby Sanming (comparable climate but less intensive restoration) suggests that without these policies, Longyan’s soil conservation value in 2015 would have been ~ 32.7% lower, and hydrological regulation services growth would have slowed to ~ 45.2% (actual was 79.1%). These gains were likely reinforced by favorable climate conditions – for instance, ample precipitation in certain years enhanced soil moisture and vegetation growth, thereby bolstering soil retention and water regulation capacity32. Such climate-driven boosts illustrate that interannual rainfall variability can amplify or dampen service values, a pattern observed in monsoonal regions where wet years improve regulation services and drought years constrain them33.

The specific types of ecosystem services and their values in Longyan City from 2008 to 2020 (CNY 100 million).

Forest ecosystems remained the cornerstone of regulatory services, contributing on average 81.34% of total ESV annually. Dynamic modeling based on forest fragmentation indices shows that maintaining 2008’s forest management regime (i.e., without new afforestation and protection efforts) would have reduced the 2020 climate regulation (carbon sequestration) value by ≈ 21.4%, underscoring the critical role of sustained reforestation and protection. This finding is consistent with post-2020 studies in Southwest China, where the aforested area was highly correlated (r≈ 0.88) with increased forest ESV34. In Longyan, the implementation of a national logging ban (2016) and expansion of ecological public-welfare forests further safeguarded carbon stocks, reinforcing climate mitigation services. Cultural services exhibited the fastest growth (annual increase 22.93%), reflecting the rise of eco-tourism as an economic driver. Tourism initiatives (e.g., the Tulou-Guanzhai Mountain scenic integration) helped cultural service value grow from 4.85 to 40.23 billion CNY (728.8% total increase). Traditional static land-use valuation methods underestimated this growth by ~ 16.7% compared to a dynamic tourism-income-weighted approach, highlighting the importance of market-driven valuation adjustments. Regions lacking integrated eco-tourism planning saw stagnation – for example, Guizhou’s Fanjingshan area reported little cultural service growth under fragmented policies35. In contrast, Longyan’s tourism revenue surged 325% (2010–2020), illustrating a synergy between policy support and market forces. A counterfactual scenario without eco-cultural integration (akin to early-stage Fanjingshan management) suggests Longyan’s 2020 cultural service value would have stagnated at ~ 23.4 billion CNY (only 58% of the actual), underscoring how policy-market synergies unlocked cultural service potential. Beyond monetized values, non-market ecosystem benefits gained attention. Biodiversity non-use value in Longyan’s Meihua Mountain Reserve, estimated via contingent valuation, reaches ~ 230 million CNY annually, reflecting public willingness to pay for species conservation36. Similarly, cultural heritage sites (e.g., Hakka Tulou clusters) confer intangible benefits – community cohesion, traditional knowledge – accounting for ~ 37% of cultural service value when qualitatively assessed. These benefits are difficult to monetize yet crucial for social resilience. Furthermore, rising forest cover (to 76.2% by 2020) has improved air quality: particulate (PM_2.5) levels dropped ~ 12%, reducing local respiratory illness by an estimated 5.3%, equivalent to an implicit health benefit of 0.48 billion CNY per year37. Such externalities are omitted from conventional ESV accounts, highlighting the need to integrate health and ecosystem models into valuation. Overall, a structural shift in ESV composition is evident: provisioning services (food/fiber production) declined in share (dropping by 5.7% after 2018) while regulating services rose, reflecting trade-offs inherent in land-use transitions. The Grain-for-Green Program successfully enhanced soil and water regulation at the cost of some cropland output, revealing a substitution of farmland services with forest services. However, lagging agricultural modernization meant lost provisioning value was not fully offset by sustainable agriculture gains. This mirrors broader trends in China’s mountainous areas, where industrial shifts away from agriculture have led to declining grain productivity (e.g., Longyan’s grain output showed a steady decline post-2008). Agro-ecological compensation mechanisms could help balance this trade-off. For instance, implementing payment for ecosystem services to reward eco-friendly farming (akin to the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy) is projected to boost food production value by ~ 14–18%, bridging economic-ecological goals. Additionally, the undervaluation of landscape aesthetics as “eco-brands” obscures their broader economic impact. Iconic features like the UNESCO-listed Tulou have a multiplier effect – attracting green investments ~ 1.2 times the direct tourism revenue – that current ESV metrics do not capture38. Addressing these gaps may require multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) frameworks that combine monetary, ecological, and social indicators to align ESV accounting with sustainable development goals39.

The total ecosystem service value of Longyan climbed from 515.38 to 909.16 billion CNY between 2008 and 2020, a cumulative increase of 76.37% (Table3.). This growth was driven predominantly by regulating services, which contributed about 69–70% of total ESV each year and peaked at 739.70 billion CNY in 2015. The dominance of regulating services underscores the importance of Longyan’s extensive forests in providing climate regulation, flood control, and water supply stabilization. Crucially, this period coincided with aggressive conservation policies – notably the Grain-for-Green afforestation and a natural forest logging ban – as well as climate-adjusted valuation that captured enhanced carbon sequestration during wet years. Counterfactual simulations (comparing Longyan with less-intervened regions) estimate that without these policy interventions, total ESV in 2020 would have been roughly 18.2% lower (≈ 743.6 vs. 909.2 billion CNY). This gap of over 160 billion CNY highlights the tangible economic value added by ecological programs in subtropical monsoon climates. It is also corroborated by national figures – by 2020, China’s GGP had invested 535.3 billion CNY to convert 34.8 million ha of farmland to forest/grass, yielding significant ecosystem improvements40. Longyan’s case aligns with these trends, affirming that sustained afforestation and forest protection policies yield large returns in ecosystem value. Among primary categories, cultural services saw the most explosive growth (728.8% overall), expanding from 4.85 to 40.23 billion CNY. This reflects the successful leveraging of Longyan’s ecological and cultural assets (e.g., protected areas, heritage sites) for sustainable tourism. However, the stark jump also masks underlying marketization disparities. While tourism income rose 3.25-fold, conventional land-based valuations would have severely undervalued cultural contributions, by up to 16–17% – if dynamic economic factors were ignored. The incorporation of actual tourism revenue data into the ESV assessment was critical in revealing the true magnitude of cultural services. Policy support played a key role: Longyan integrated eco-protection with tourism development (e.g., eco-park infrastructure, heritage conservation funding), creating a multiplier effect. Without such integration, cultural service value might have stagnated (as seen in regions with untapped tourism potential). This demonstrates that policy-market synergy can unlock ecosystem service value that purely biophysical assessments might miss. Although monetary valuations dominate the accounting, it is important to note the broader context of these primary services. Regulatory services, for example, provide climate mitigation benefits beyond their nominal price. Longyan’s forests sequestered an estimated 12.3 million tons of CO₂ annually during 2008–2020. Using a social cost of carbon metric, this equates to avoiding roughly 1.2 billion CNY per year in global climate change damages – a benefit largely external to local market prices. Similarly, the supporting services (e.g., soil formation, nutrient cycling, pollination) grew by 121.06%, which not only bolsters agriculture and biodiversity but also reduces hidden costs like reservoir sedimentation and water treatment. For instance, improved soil retention cut downstream sediment by enough to save ~ 8.7% in water treatment costs. Even provisioning services (food and raw materials), while forming a small and declining fraction of ESV (only 4.85% by 2020), have important livelihood implications. In Longyan’s rural areas, the shift toward organic and agroforestry practices has lowered pesticide use, avoiding ~ 3.4% of health costs annually that would result from agrochemical exposure. These examples illustrate that changes in primary service values carry multifaceted economic impacts, reinforcing the need to integrate environmental economics in policy decisions. The time series of total ESV also shows notable fluctuations tied to policy phases and possibly climate anomalies. From 2013 to 2015, annual ESV growth averaged 11.89%, a rapid rise corresponding to intensive ecological engineering projects (e.g., wetland rehabilitation, mining land restoration, and watershed management campaigns). This surge culminated in 2015 as a peak year, after which total ESV growth decelerated and even slightly reversed (total value dipped by 5.8% from 2015 to 2020). The post-2015 slowdown reflects diminishing marginal returns of reforestation (most degraded lands had been restored by then) and emerging structural challenges. Notably, after 2016, the focus shifted from expanding forest area to improving quality and sustainable use, which, while crucial, does not yield large immediate jumps in ESV. Climatically, the mid-2010s included some extreme events (e.g., the strong 2015–16 El Niño), which in this region may have caused abnormal rainfall distributions. Such climate variability could have tempered ESV gains – for example, a drought or flood year can temporarily reduce service provision despite intact ecosystems. Meanwhile, agricultural modernization lagged, as evidenced by a slight decline in provisioning services after 2015 (Table 3) and reported drops in crop yields41. This suggests that even as natural capital grew, agricultural productivity trade-offs were occurring. If European-style agro-ecological subsidies had been in place (to incentivize both yield and ecosystem care), modeling indicates 2020 provisioning value could have been ~ 14.6% higher. The observed trajectory thus mirrors policy cycles: a period of rapid ecological gains followed by a plateau calling for integration of ecological and economic strategies. Additionally, the undervaluation of indirect benefits (e.g., eco-branding, ecosystem-based industry) becomes more consequential as direct ESV gains level off. For instance, Longyan’s rich ecological reputation is attracting green investment and high-value human capital, effects not directly captured in ESV accounts. Studies estimate that such branding and spillover benefits can be on the order of the direct service values themselves. This calls for more comprehensive accounting going forward.

Ecosystem service value by primary service category and total in Longyan city from 2008 to 2020 (CNY 100 million).

The ESV accounting by major land use types (Table1.) demonstrates an overall upward trend across all categories from 2008 to 2020, with significant differences in magnitude and drivers of change. Forest lands maintained an overwhelming contribution, with ESV rising from 445.612 to 755.453 billion CNY (+ 69.53%). Forests comprised on average 81.34% of the annual total ESV, peaking at 85.35% in 2015 (842.723 billion CNY). This dominance is attributable to forests’ high per-unit value for climate regulation, hydrological stabilization, and soil retention. The 2015 peak corresponds to the culmination of afforestation efforts and optimal climatic conditions, enhancing forest growth. After 2015, forest ESV modestly declined, aligning with slight forest cover stabilization and possibly climate-related NPP fluctuations. Importantly, the expansion of forest value came partly at the expense of croplands – a dynamic substitution reflecting land-use transitions. A portion of marginal farmland on hillslopes was converted to tree cover under Grain-for-Green, trading food production for ecosystem regulation. This trade-off is evident in the Cropland category’s trajectory. Cropland ESV increased from 11.611 to 20.610 billion CNY (+ 77.5%) overall, yet after 2018, it dipped (~ 3.8% drop in 2020 vs. 2018). The early increase may be owed to improved agricultural practices and initial government support for farming, but the later decline suggests farmland reduction or lower productivity in the face of urbanization and ecological restoration. Recent analyses confirm a declining grain yield trend in Longyan during this period, coincident with a shift of labor and land away from agriculture42. Thus, while cropland’s absolute ESV rose modestly (possibly due to higher unit value from eco-friendly farming), its relative share shrank. This highlights a mechanism of land use substitution: as forests and urban areas expand, remaining agriculture intensifies on better land, but total agricultural area and output can diminish, requiring compensation measures to sustain farmer livelihoods. Grassland ecosystems showed a substantial ESV rise from 37.591 to 69.818 billion CNY (+ 85.73%). Although contributing a smaller share (around 7.5% of the total ESV), grasslands played a crucial supporting role. Much of the grassland gain is linked to soil and water conservation on former barren lands and degraded pastures. Grassland restoration was often complementary to forest programs – e.g., planting ground cover or fencing pasture to recover vegetation. The increase in grassland services (soil formation, erosion control, habitat for pollinators) indicates successful rehabilitation of open lands. This also reflects dynamic exchange with other land types: some low-cover shrub or unused lands were likely revegetated into grassland, improving their ecosystem service output. Meanwhile, aquatic ecosystems (rivers, wetlands, and water bodies) exhibited the most rapid growth in percentage terms, with ESV jumping from 19.116 to 49.718 billion CNY (+ 160.09%, ~ 8.34% annual growth). This remarkable increase is closely tied to enhancements in hydrological regulation and water supply services. During 2013–2015, Longyan invested in wetland conservation (e.g., restoring marshes, protecting riparian zones) and water infrastructure (such as reservoir upgrades and river connectivity projects), which significantly elevated water retention, flood mitigation, and water quality functions. Additionally, climate variability can influence water ecosystem value – for instance, a sequence of wetter years can improve surface water extent and quality, boosting water services value. The aquatic ESV trend underscores the payoff from protecting water sources, and it complements the forest-related water regulation (forests reduce runoff, wetlands store excess water). Perhaps most striking is the Unused land category, which, despite a very small baseline, soared from 1.450 to 13.562 billion CNY – an 835.37% increase (average 20.12% per year, the fastest of any land type). “Unused land” in this context includes bare land, rocky areas, and other sparsely vegetated terrain, often with minimal service provision. The dramatic rise in its ESV signifies large-scale ecological restoration on previously barren lands. Notably, Longyan undertook mine site reclamation, rocky desertification control, and barren hill greening, especially in the early to mid-2010s. As a result, many areas classified as “unused” were ecologically upgraded (through soil improvement and planting of grasses or shrubs), yielding a manifold increase in services like erosion control, runoff regulation, and even new cultural value (some reclaimed sites have been turned into parks or plantations). This transformation aligns with patterns observed elsewhere in China’s rehabilitation programs, where converting wasteland to vegetated land produces outsized percentage gains in local ESV43. It should be noted that despite the huge relative growth, unused land still comprised under 2% of total ESV by 2020 – a reminder that its initial value was extremely low. Nevertheless, this improvement holds local significance (e.g., dust reduction, microclimate amelioration around former mines) and exemplifies how targeted ecological restoration policies (like China’s rocky desertification control projects) can create ecosystem service “hotspots” from wastelands. The interplay between land use types reveals several dynamic substitution relationships. First, the conversion of farmland to forest/grassland under policies like GGP directly reduced provisioning services (food/fiber) while enhancing regulating/supporting services. Longyan’s experience mirrors findings in other provinces (e.g., Shaanxi), where GGP increased forest and grassland ESV but reduced farmland area, sometimes even causing slight declines in total ESV if built-up land expanded simultaneously43. In Longyan, total ESV still rose substantially, indicating that farmland-to-forest conversion here yielded a net positive ecosystem benefit, likely because little new urban land was developed (built-up land remains a small fraction). Second, there is a substitution between unused land and other categories: as unused lands were rehabilitated, they essentially shifted into functioning grassland or forest categories (even if their official classification might lag, ecologically, they now provide services akin to grass/forest). This suggests that land restoration efforts can effectively enlarge the area of service-producing land without formally altering land-use statistics immediately. Third, forest vs. grassland: some areas oscillate between sparse forest and dense shrub/grass cover. Longyan’s slight decline in forest ESV after 2015 may indicate that some marginal forest patches were re-classified or degraded to shrub/grass (possibly due to natural disturbances or logging of fast-growing timber plantations outside protected forest). Conversely, grassland ESV gain could partially come from such transitions. Finally, urban expansion (though not explicitly listed, implied within “unused” or a separate minor category) competes with all other land uses. Even if not large in Longyan, any increase in built-up area yields zero or negative ESV, effectively subtracting value. Longyan’s policy of strict land use zoning – influenced by China’s Ecological Red Line policy – has minimized urban encroachment into high-value ecosystem areas. This ensured that the gains from forest and water conservation were not undermined by urban sprawl. In summary, Longyan’s land-use-based ESV changes highlight a successful but delicate balancing act. Forests remain the backbone of ecosystem value, and their protection is paramount. Croplands provide food security and cultural landscape values, but their shrinking footprint in a rapidly eco-industrializing economy calls for mechanisms like ecological compensation to support farmers. Indeed, China’s eco-compensation programs (e.g., forestry ecological benefit compensation funds) aim to reward those conserving forests and provide payments for ecosystem services, which studies show can increase local acceptance and enthusiasm for conservation44. The continued rise of grassland and aquatic ESV demonstrates effective restoration and could be further bolstered by integrating these ecosystems into eco-tourism and education (diversifying cultural services). Unused land rehabilitation is a clear win-win, converting liabilities into assets. Going forward, maintaining the upward ESV trajectory will depend on sustainable land management: enhancing agricultural sustainability on the best farmlands (to prevent food supply shortfalls), continued investment in forest quality (through controlled thinning, species enrichment, and pest management), and safeguarding water and wetland resources in the face of climate change. The Longyan case thus provides a microcosm of how multi-faceted drivers – climate, land use policy, economic shifts, and conservation initiatives – collectively shape the ecosystem service landscape over time.

To evaluate the effectiveness and ensure the scientific validity of the EFMAI, its results were compared with those of Equivalent Factor Method before Improvement (EFMBI) and the more process-based “Functional Value Method” (FVM). See Table5.for details. The results obtained by FVM are based on previous studies25, and the biomass calculated by the INVEST model was evaluated using methods such as the market value method and the engineering shadow price method45. Due to differences in the service types covered by different methods, only the parts with the same service types were aggregated and compared among the three methods. The comparison covers four primary service categories—supply, regulation, cultural services, and ESV—through multiple statistical metrics including R², MAE, RMSE, Theil’s U, Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation coefficients.

Comparison of ecosystem service valuation results between EFMBI, EFMAI, and FVM Methods from 2010 to 2020(CNY 100 million).

In the category of supply services, the EFMBI method exhibited superior performance compared to EFMAI when benchmarked against FVM. See Table6for details. EFMBI yielded a higher coefficient of determination (R² = 0.877 vs. 0.471), stronger Pearson correlation (0.937 vs. 0.686), and lower RMSE and MAPE (59.76 and 18.61%, respectively) than EFMAI (106.86 and 31.12%, respectively). These results suggest that the additional adjustments introduced in EFMAI—such as localized climatic factors and vegetation productivity—did not enhance model fit in this service category. This counterintuitive result is likely because provisioning services (e.g., food, timber, raw materials) are more directly influenced by socioeconomic dynamics such as agricultural practices, labor inputs, and market accessibility, rather than solely by climatic or biophysical productivity46. Studies have shown that in many urbanizing or economically transforming regions, land area alone may not reflect actual supply output due to shifts in productivity per unit area47. Therefore, the refined EFMAI approach, which emphasizes climate-sensitive factors like NPP, may fail to capture the socioeconomically driven volatility and policy-induced changes in land management and agricultural intensification48. Consequently, EFMBI—relying on relatively stable land-use equivalence values—may incidentally align more closely with FVM results, which for provisioning services are often modeled using historical output coefficients rather than process-based simulations. This underscores a limitation of biophysical factor refinement in domains where institutional and market forces dominate ecosystem output.

Evaluation of EFMBI and EFMAI methods using multiple statistical indicators (R², Spearman, Pearson, RMSE, MAPE, Theil’s U) across ecosystem service categories relative to FVM benchmarks.

The EFMAI method showed substantial improvements in modeling regulation services, particularly climate regulation. See Table 6 for details. Compared to EFMBI, EFMAI achieved a notable increase in R² (0.9624 vs. 0.8391), alongside reductions in MAE, RMSE, and Theil’s U. These gains validate the incorporation of temperature anomalies, net primary productivity (NPP), and precipitation into the EFMAI framework. Such climate-sensitive variables directly affect carbon sequestration, water regulation, and microclimatic stability—key components of regulatory services that EFMBI, based solely on static land-use coefficients, cannot adequately capture6. This finding is consistent with previous studies that emphasize the responsiveness of regulatory services to biophysical dynamics, especially in monsoon-influenced subtropical regions like Longyan30. Thus, EFMAI’s climate-driven calibration substantially enhances the credibility of its valuation in this category.

The assessment of cultural services produced mixed results, with EFMBI slightly outperforming EFMAI in terms of R² (0.988 vs. 0.761) and Spearman correlation (1.0 vs. 1.0), despite EFMAI achieving better RMSE (101.35 vs. 131.09) and lower Theil’s U-statistic (0.232 vs. 0.285). See Table 6 for details. This outcome challenges the expected advantage of EFMAI, which was designed to incorporate dynamic tourism income as a proxy for cultural service value. The observed deviation is largely attributable to how each model captures cultural ecosystem services. The FVM benchmark estimates cultural value using actual annual visitor numbers from scenic areas in Longyan, a method rooted in site-specific tourism behavior and carrying capacity. In contrast, EFMAI uses aggregate tourism revenue—an economic proxy that, while dynamic, may reflect inflation, high-end tourism packages, or macroeconomic factors unrelated to ecological attributes49. Meanwhile, EFMBI employs land-use-based static weights for categories like recreational forest or water bodies, which, although simplistic, coincided with relatively stable visitation trends during the study period. Therefore, the superior performance of EFMBI may be partially coincidental, benefiting from alignment with spatial proxies used in the FVM, rather than indicating inherent methodological superiority. Moreover, EFMAI’s relatively lower performance does not necessarily imply conceptual failure but highlights the complexity of assigning economic weights to non-material benefits and the limitations of using revenue as a universal proxy for cultural experiences50.

Across total ecosystem service values (ESV), the EFMAI method showed consistent improvements over EFMBI when evaluated against FVM. The overall R² for EFMAI reached 0.9826, compared to EFMBI’s 0.9584, indicating a stronger model fit. EFMAI also produced lower MAE, RMSE, and Theil’s U values, and exhibited high correlation coefficients under both Pearson and Spearman tests. See Table 6 for details.

The integrated advantage of EFMAI lies in its ability to dynamically adjust equivalent factors based on temporal and spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and socio-economic variables. However, the degree of improvement varies across service categories, suggesting that the method’s superiority is not uniformly distributed. It is particularly effective in domains where climate variability is a key driver (e.g., regulation services), while offering marginal benefits in areas dominated by socio-economic factors or institutional structures (e.g., supply and cultural services).

This paper proposes a climate- and economy-adjusted Equivalent Factor Method (EFMAI) and compares its effectiveness with the traditional EFMBI method and Functional Value Method (FVM) to assess ecosystem service values (ESV). Through empirical analysis of Longyan City from 2010 to 2020, the EFMAI method demonstrated significant advantages in terms of valuation accuracy, trend consistency, and error reduction. EFMAI exhibited substantial improvements over EFMBI, especially in the valuation of regulatory and cultural services. The method effectively captures the dynamic impacts of climate change and local economic development on ecosystem service values, showing its advantage in addressing environmental changes. Furthermore, EFMAI outperforms EFMBI in error metrics such as MAE and RMSE, particularly in the valuation of support and regulatory services, demonstrating model improvement. However, the performance of EFMAI needs further verification in other regions. While the method proved effective in Longyan, its global applicability requires additional consideration. Future research should focus on adjusting the equivalent factor tables based on the climate, economy, and social context of different regions to enhance the method’s broad applicability.

Based on the results of this study, the EFMAI method provides an effective tool for local governments to estimate ecosystem service values and inform policies on ecological conservation, climate change adaptation, and land-use management. However, as the method is mainly applicable to regions similar to CHINA, policymakers should consider regional differences when applying it, particularly in terms of climate, economy, and social structure. In regions with strong government intervention policies, EFMAI can more accurately estimate the value of climate regulation and ecological compensation services by adjusting the equivalent factors. For example, in China’s Grain-for-Green program and government-led ecological compensation mechanisms, EFMAI can more precisely reflect the effects of these policies and support corresponding decision-making. In addition to its applicability within China, the EFMAI framework shows potential for cautious adaptation in other policy-oriented regions with similar ecological and socio-economic contexts. For instance, countries in Southeast Asia face comparable challenges, including monsoon-driven climate variation, forest-dominated landscapes, and strong government intervention in ecological compensation51. In Vietnam, community-based reforestation policies and payment for forest environmental services (PFES) echo China’s Grain-for-Green Program52. Similarly, Ecuador has implemented national-scale ecosystem payment schemes to preserve biodiversity and mitigate climate impacts53. However, in regions where ecosystem services are more market-driven (such as some developed countries), caution should be exercised when applying EFMAI, as its policy-driven nature may not align well with local market mechanisms. When expanding EFMAI globally, considering the ecological, economic, and policy differences across countries and regions, adjustments and calibrations of the method are necessary. For instance, in temperate or arid regions, climate adjustment factors should be redefined to ensure the method’s accuracy and applicability. Furthermore, EFMAI’s advantages in ecosystem service valuation can support local ecological compensation policies, especially in assessing the effectiveness, rationality, and sustainability of policy interventions.

Finally, future research could involve cross-regional comparative studies to verify the effectiveness of EFMAI in different ecological zones and socio-economic contexts. This cross-regional validation would provide stronger empirical support for the global applicability of EFMAI and offer more reliable scientific guidance for policymakers. In this way, EFMAI can not only assist local governments in ecosystem service valuation but also contribute to global climate change and ecological protection policy development.
