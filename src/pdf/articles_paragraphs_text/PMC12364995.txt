Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) are major global health concerns, with a rising prevalence worsened by the COVID‐19 pandemic. The interplay between these chronic conditions and COVID‐19 presents a unique public health challenge, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries such as Bangladesh. This study aimed to (1) determine the prevalence of DM and HT among individuals affected by COVID‐19 pandemic in Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh, and (2) explore associations with sociodemographic and biological factors.

This cross‐sectional study was conducted in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh between April and August 2021. Data was collected from 390 COVID‐19‐positive patients using a structured questionnaire and physical measurements, focusing on sociodemographic and biological factors associated with DM and HT. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors.

Among participants, 12.05% had DM, 15.89% had HT, and 7.95% had both. Older age ( > 50 years) was significantly associated with higher prevalence of both conditions (p<  0.001). Females were more likely to have DM (16.6% vs. 9.2%), HT (19.2% vs. 13.8%), and both (10.6% vs. 6.3%) than males (p<  0.05). Private or self‐employed individuals had a significantly higher risk of both DM and HT (RRR: 7.66, 95% CI: 4.26–12.37,p<  0.001). Obesity (BMI ≥ 25) was linked to increased prevalence of DM (13.2%), HT (21.0%), and both (10.2%). Elevated SBP and DBP were strongly associated with comorbidity (p<  0.001), and tobacco use increased the odds of DM (AOR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.13–5.29,p=  0.02).

Targeted interventions, such as community‐based education, improved chronic disease management, and culturally tailored strategies, are recommended to address these conditions effectively. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure and conducting longitudinal research to explore causal pathways will be critical in mitigating the impact of these comorbidities and improving pandemic preparedness in resource‐limited settings.

Natural disasters and pandemics are stressful occurrences that occur worldwide and have a substantial impact on people's personal, socioeconomic and well‐beings [1,2,3]. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on March 11, 2020, it was declared a pandemic [4]. Since the far less severe 2002–2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), COVID–19 is the most concerning atypical pneumonia outbreak [5]. It has infected over 777 million people worldwide as of January 2025, resulting in over 7 million casualties [6]. The most common comorbidities associated with increased risk or severity of COVID‐19 are diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension (HT), obesity, and chronic lung disease. In a 2021–2022 hospital‐based study, DM was present in 82.7% of severe cases, CKD in 43%, HT in 25.7%, and obesity in 23.6%, with severe forms of these conditions significantly increasing mortality risk [7]. Another large multi‐hospital study found that DM, obesity, and HT were consistently linked to higher infection rates, severity, and death, while renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression further increased severity and fatality [8]. These findings underscore the critical impact of these comorbidities on COVID‐19 outcomes and highlight the importance of targeted prevention and management strategies for affected individuals.

Globally, DM, especially type 2, has been rising rapidly, with prevalence estimates reaching 6.28% of the world's population and affecting hundreds of millions, while causing over a million deaths annually [9]. In Bangladesh, the prevalence of DM among adults increased from 12.1% in 2011 to 14.4% in 2017/2018, with urban areas showing higher rates (10.8%) compared to rural areas (7.4%) [9,10]. Among lower‐educated adults in Bangladesh, DM prevalence is about 9.3%, and overall, approximately 10% of adults are affected [11]. HT is another leading global health concern, affecting over a billion people worldwide and contributing significantly to cardiovascular disease and mortality, with global deaths attributable to high blood pressure estimated in the millions each year [12]. In Bangladesh, the burden is substantial, with recent studies reporting a HT prevalence of 25.1% to 28.6% among adults, and even higher rates (up to 31%) among lower‐educated populations [11,12]. Among adults aged 18–49 years, the prevalence is 19.8%, and it rises with age, education, and wealth, particularly in urban areas [12].

This study draws inspiration from prior studies, which have highlighted a significant prevalence of DM and HT in COVID‐19 patients. For example, a comprehensive analysis revealed an overall prevalence of DM and HT among COVID‐19 patients to be 12% and 17% respectively, with these conditions linked to poor outcomes in severe COVID‐19 cases [13]. Another study conducted on a large cohort in the United States echoed these findings, showing that 43% of COVID‐19 patients had HT and 12% had DM. This study further underscored the impact of the level of control of these conditions on COVID‐19 severity [14]. Among COVID‐19 patients, several overlapping risk factors contribute to adverse outcomes related to both DM and HT. These include older age, female gender, obesity or elevated body mass index, poor glycemic and blood pressure control, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease [15,16,17]. Additional factors such as insulin treatment and higher COVID‐19 severity are particularly associated with DM‐related complications, while smoking is more closely linked to HT‐related risks [15,16,18]. Moreover, a substantial proportion of COVID‐19 infections may have gone undetected due to asymptomatic presentation or limited access to testing during peak transmission periods [19]. Recent evidence also suggests a link between pre‐existing conditions such as DM and HT, and the risk of developing COVID‐19, underscoring the need to monitor cardiometabolic health in postinfection populations [20].

Non‐communicable diseases (NCDs) such as stroke, heart disease, and cancer are the leading causes of mortality in Bangladesh, accounting for approximately 67% of all deaths [21,22]. The country is undergoing an epidemiological transition from communicable to non‐communicable diseases, a shift further complicated by the COVID‐19 pandemic. As of May 2025, Bangladesh reported over 2 million COVID‐19 cases and more than 29,000 fatalities [23]. Factors such as high population density, inadequate hygiene practices, limited access to healthcare resources, and high unemployment rates worsen the population's vulnerability to the virus. While several studies have established that DM and HT are common comorbidities among COVID‐19 patients and are associated with increased severity, hospitalization, and mortality, most existing research in Bangladesh has focused on clinical outcomes, risk factors, and the general prevalence of these comorbidities in hospitalized or ICU patients. However, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the precise prevalence of DM and HT among COVID‐19 positive individuals at the divisional level, particularly in community‐based or nonhospitalized populations. As a result, the main goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of DM and HT among individuals diagnosed with COVID‐19 in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh. Additionally, the study aimed to explore the association of sociodemographic factors (age, sex, education, occupation, and income) and biological factors (body mass index (BMI), tobacco usage, blood glucose level, and blood pressure) with the prevalence of DM and HT among COVID‐19 positive patients.

The current study was a cross‐sectional design to find the prevalence of DM and HT among COVID–19 patients and association with sociodemographic, and biological variables.

The information about the research and call for participants was widely shared through social media. Data was collected in Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh between April, and August 2021, during the COVID–19 pandemic's post–wave. Data was acquired with the help of Research Assistants (RAs). RAs were the medical college students who had access to the participants as required. They measured the participants' weight, blood glucose level, and blood pressure professionally besides other information. Before collecting data, they informed the participants about the context of the study, the purpose, the procedures, the confidentiality agreement, and consent.

The inclusion criteria for this study were participants being Bangladeshi citizens aged 18 or older, had a confirmed positive test for COVID‐19 within the last 6 months and had DM or HT or both. The exclusion criteria included a lack of awareness of personal health‐related data, incomplete or inadequate survey responses, and information sourced from biased or unreliable means.

The primary outcomes of interest are the presence of DM and HT. The independent variables included – 1) COVID‐19 status, which is the central focus of this study, 2) Sociodemographic variables – age, sex, education, occupation, and monthly income, captured in the first section of the questionnaire; 3) Biological variables – body mass index (BMI), tobacco usage, blood glucose level, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, obtained through physical measurements and recorded in the second section.

The sex variable was categorized as male or female, exclusively, due to the absence of participants identifying outside these categories. The participants' average age wasM= 38.73 (SD = 16.263 years), with a range of 18 to 100 years. For educational background, the initial category was ‘Below HSC’, representing participants who had not successfully completed the higher school certificate (HSC) exam at the 12th standard. This category included individuals with varying levels of education, ranging from those without formal education to those who had completed primary (5th standard) or secondary school (10th standard). Regarding occupation, students and unemployed individuals were grouped together under a single category, recognizing their common financial dependence on others and lack of personal income.

We calculated BMI from height and weight, and it was classified according to Asia–Pacific guidelines: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–22.9 kg/m2), overweight 23.0–24.9 kg/m2), or obese (≥ 25 kg/m2). We merged the underweight and normal weight categories in the BMI classification due to a limited number of participants in the underweight group, which necessitated combining these categories for statistical robustness and meaningful analysis.

Per the criteria established by the Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, diabetes classification encompasses three tiers: normal, defined by an HbA1c level below 5.7% (equivalent to < 39 mmol/mol); prediabetes, characterized by an HbA1c ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol); and diabetes, diagnosed when HbA1c levels are 6.5% or higher (≥ 48 mmol/mol). In this analysis, the categorization was streamlined by consolidating the blood glucose statuses into two primary groups: ‘Diabetic’, comprising those with HbA1c levels indicative of diabetes, and ‘Nondiabetic’, which includes both the normal and prediabetic HbA1c ranges.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) delineates the classification of blood pressure in adults into distinct categories: Normal (SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg), Pre‐HT (SBP = 120–139 mmHg or DBP = 80–89 mmHg), Stage 1 HT (SBP = 140–159 mmHg or DBP = 90–99 mmHg), and Stage 2 HT (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg). In this study, this classification was simplified by categorizing blood pressure levels into ‘Normal’ and ‘Elevated,’ with the latter category combining the Pre‐HT, Stage 1, and Stage 2 HT categories into a single group, thereby facilitating a more streamlined analysis of blood pressure trends among the study population.

COVID‐19 status was defined based on a confirmed positive test result within the past 6 months. Participants self‐reported their COVID‐19 status, which included results from RT‐PCR or government‐approved rapid antigen tests. To ensure accuracy, RAs verified these reports by checking that they were issued by recognized diagnostic laboratories or confirmed through official government notifications, such as text message alerts or digital certificates issued by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of Bangladesh.

The questionnaire inquired into self‐reported tobacco usage, which encompassed cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, etc. This aspect of the study was particularly critical, as it aimed to identify and control potential confounding factors. While tobacco usage is a known risk factor for HT, the study sought to isolate its impact from that of COVID‐19, acknowledging that COVID‐19's direct influence on HT is not a primary consideration.

Selection bias was minimized through well‐defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and random selection of participants with 61.3% of them being male. Information bias was addressed by verifying COVID‐19 test results through authenticated sources and using RAs who are medical students for collecting biological data. We limited the recall period to 6 months to reduce recall bias. Additionally, a range of sociodemographic and biological variables were included to adjust for potential confounders. Statistical analyses, including multivariable logistic regression, were utilized to further control for these confounders, ensuring a robust and reliable interpretation of the relationship between COVID‐19 and the prevalence of DM and HT.

If the disease's prevalence is expected to be between 10% and 90%, a precision of 5% is sufficient, and so d = 0.05. This precision will give the width of 95% CI as 10%, for example, 30%–40%, or 60%–70%. However, there is little research to base this on; hencep= 0.5 was initially chosen. According to the calculation, a sample size of 384 was determined. After removing incomplete or ineligible data from the 450 responses submitted, 390 were reviewed.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant characteristics. Variables were reported as frequencies and percentages with chi‐square test statistics andp‐value. Associations between categorical variables (e.g., presence of DM or HT and covariates) were assessed using Pearson's chi‐square test of independence. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with the presence of DM and HT separately, yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Additionally, a multinomial logistic regression model was fitted to assess associations with mutually exclusive categories of DM only, HT only, and both, compared to no condition. Covariates considered included age, sex, education, occupation, income, BMI category, tobacco use, blood pressure, and blood glucose level. Variables not statistically significant in univariate analysis (p≥ 0.05) were excluded from multivariable models, while known confounders (e.g., age, sex, BMI, tobacco use) were retained. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and relative risk ratios (RRR) with 95% CI were reported for multivariable models. All statistical tests were two‐sided, and ap‐value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), directed acyclic graph were created using DAGitty, and citations were managed with Zotero.

Table1represents the associations between participant characteristics and the prevalence of DM, HT, both conditions, and their absence. Among the participants, 25.6% were aged over 50, a demographic that exhibited the highest incidence of HT, DM, or both, with statistical significance (p< 0.001). The study comprised with male participants (61.3%), with a greater tendency towards HT, whereas females (38.7%) showed a higher tendency to DM, a dichotomy that reached significance (p= 0.007). BMI emerged as a significant determinant of health status (p= 0.066). Educational attainment was notably correlated with health outcomes; those with master's degrees or higher were predominantly affected by HT, and this correlation was statistically significant (p= 0.001). Occupational role (p< 0.001) and monthly income (p= 0.033) also served as significant predictors of health status. HT was primarily observed in government employees, while DM was more common among individuals in the private sector or self‐employment. A majority of participants (58.7%) reported a monthly income below the average, with the highest HT prevalence observed within this income bracket. Conversely, 68.2% of these lower‐income participants did not suffer from DM or HT. Additionally, both SBP and DBP were significantly associated with the participants' health conditions (p< 0.001 for both).

Table2shows a binary logistic regression analysis, stratified into unadjusted and adjusted models, to find factors associated with the diabetic status of participants. In the unadjusted model, it appears that being male, younger age (18–35), and having normal or underweight BMI are factors associated with lower odds of DM (OR < 1), indicating potential protective effects. Conversely, certain occupations and tobacco usage present higher odds (OR > 1), suggesting these are risk factors for DM. In the adjusted model, which accounts for confounders, some changes in significance and effect size are noted. The protective effect of being younger remains robust after adjustment (OR for 18–35 age group: 0.09 to 0.58), reinforcing the strength of this association. However, the initially observed lower odds for males and certain occupational categories are no longer significant, indicating these may have been confounded by other variables in the model.

Despite its lack of significance in the unadjusted model, education was included in the adjusted model because of its potential as a social determinant of health that may impact DM risk. In this study, however, education did not show a statistically significant association with DM in the unadjusted model (pvalues > 0.17 across educational categories) nor in the adjusted model (pvalues > 0.57 across educational categories). Tobacco usage stands out in the adjusted model with a significantly increased risk of DM (AOR: 1.13 to 5.29), maintaining its role as a clear risk factor. This finding is consistent and warrants public health attention. The unadjusted model initially suggested a protective effect for normal SBP, but this association does not hold in the adjusted model. Since the 95% CI in the adjusted model crosses 1, the initial association with normal SBP could be attributed to confounding factors that are accounted for in the adjusted model.

Table3illustrates the findings from a binary logistic regression analysis where the outcome of interest is elevated SBP, with ‘normal’ SBP serving as the reference category. The analysis was conducted using both unadjusted and adjusted models to identify factors that are associated with the likelihood of having elevated SBP. Sex was excluded due to insignificant results in the unadjusted model.

The younger age group of 18–35 shows a protective effect against elevated SBP (95% CI for AOR: 0.18–1.09,p= 0.08), although thepvalue is marginally above the conventional threshold for significance. In this population, education does not appear to significantly affect the likelihood of having elevated SBP, with the adjusted model showing no significant association across different levels of education attainment. Regarding occupation, being a private employee or self‐employed is associated with a higher likelihood of elevated SBP (95% CI for AOR: 1.96–16.37,p< 0.001), suggesting an important area for intervention. Income level below average is not significantly associated with elevated SBP once adjusted for other factors (95% CI for AOR: 0.42–3.01,p= 0.81).

For individuals with underweight and normal BMI categories, there is a suggestion of a protective effect, but this is not statistically significant in the adjusted model (95% CI for AOR: 0.27–1.03,p= 0.06). Tobacco usage, which is often a key variable of interest due to its known health risks, shows no significant association with elevated SBP in the adjusted model (95% CI for AOR: 0.59–2.14,p= 0.73). This finding suggests that, in the context of this study population, tobacco usage does not independently predict elevated SBP when controlling for other variables. This is an interesting result, as tobacco use is typically associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes, including elevated blood pressure. It's possible that the effects of tobacco might be mediated through other factors not adjusted for in this model, or that the sample size or the population characteristics might limit the detectability of its effect in this specific analysis. Having a nondiabetic blood glucose status is associated with lower odds of elevated SBP in the unadjusted model (OR: 0.31–0.87,p= 0.01), but this association does not persist in the adjusted model (95% CI for AOR: 0.47–1.88,p= 0.87), indicating that the initial finding may be confounded by other variables. Additionally, having elevated DBP is a strong predictor of elevated SBP, with a significant association in both unadjusted and adjusted models (95% CI for AOR: 0.05–0.18,p< 0.001), which is expected given the physiological relationship between SBP and DBP.

Table4presents the analysis of factors associated with elevated DBP, utilizing both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models. Sex, monthly income, tobacco usage, and blood glucose level, while included in the unadjusted model, are not present in the adjusted model, indicating that they do not have a significant independent effect on DBP when other factors are considered.

While age was a significant predictor in the unadjusted model for the 18–35 category (p= 0.01), this significance is not maintained in the adjusted model (p= 0.22), which could suggest that the initial association may have been confounded by other variables. Government employees, who appear to have higher odds of elevated DBP in the unadjusted model (p< 0.001), do not retain this association in the adjusted model (p= 0.93). Similarly, the bachelor's level of education shows a significant protective effect in the unadjusted model (p= 0.003), but this effect is not observed after adjustments (p= 0.15). This lack of significance in the adjusted model may be due to confounding factors being accounted for or the interplay between different variables. In the adjusted model, underweight and normal BMI categories are significantly associated with reduced odds of elevated DBP (95% CI for AOR: 0.05–0.22,p< 0.001), as is the overweight category (95% CI for AOR: 0.05–0.20,p< 0.001). This indicates that, relative to individuals categorized as obese, those with a lower BMI are less likely to have elevated DBP, highlighting the protective effect of a lower BMI against elevated DBP. The association between elevated SBP and elevated DBP is robust, with elevated SBP being a strong predictor of elevated DBP in both models (95% CI for AOR: 0.06–0.20,p< 0.001), underscoring the relationship between these two measures of blood pressure.

Table5showcases the results from an adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, evaluating factors associated with DM, HT or having both conditions, with ‘None’ as the reference status for the participants.

Adjusted multinomial logistic regression model of the status of the participants and associated factors.

In assessing the risk factors associated with DM in the adjusted model, sex, age, and education does not seem to play a statistically significant role. But the occupational status indicates that government employees have a lower association with DM compared to the reference group (OR < 1,p= 0.05). Interestingly, monthly income less than 35000 BDT is associated with DM (RRR < 1,p< 0.03), suggesting a socioeconomic dimension to DM prevalence. Tobacco usage and blood pressure do not present a significant association with DM, with p‐values of 0.21 and 0.13, respectively. When examining HT, male participants show a significant association (RRR < 1,p< 0.001), indicating that sex is a determinant factor in HT prevalence. Age shows a significant inverse relationship with HT, with respective p‐values of 0.01 in both cases and RRR < 0.67 across all categories. As the 95% CI includes 1 andp> 0.05, BMI and occupation does not emerge as a significant factor in relation to HT status. Education level, and tobacco usage does not significantly predict HT, similar to the findings for DM.

In evaluating the risk factors for the simultaneous presence of DM and HT, sex does not play a significant role, with a p‐value of 0.55. For age, a reverse association is observed in the younger cohort (18–35 years) compared to those over 50 (95% CI = 0.00 – 0.46,p= 0.01). BMI, education, and monthly income, do not show a significant association, with p‐values above 0.5 across categories. Occupational status is a predictor of having both, with government employees and private employees/self‐employed individuals showing a strong association with the combined conditions, with RRR > 2.54 across all categories and p‐values of < 0.001. This means, participants who are earning money are more likely to have DM and HT together compared to students and unemployed. Tobacco users are more likely to have both conditions (RRR > 1 andp< 0.03). On the other hand, nondiabetic individuals are significantly less likely to have both conditions (RRR < 0.01 andp< 0.001). Elevated systolic and DBP levels do not show a significant association with the combined outcome, with p‐values of 0.2 and 0.41, respectively.

This study examined the prevalence of DM and HT among COVID‐19 patients in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh, focusing on their associations with sociodemographic and biological factors. The findings revealed that 12.05% of participants had DM, 15.89% had HT, and 7.95% had both conditions. Sociodemographic characteristics, including sex, age, and occupation, as well as biological factors such as BMI, blood pressure, and tobacco use, were significantly associated with these comorbidities. To comprehensively assess these relationships, three complementary statistical approaches were employed: chi‐square tests (Table1), binary logistic regression (Tables2,3,4), and multinomial logistic regression (Table5). The chi‐square analysis identified significant bivariate associations, such as older age, female sex, obesity, and occupational status with increased prevalence of DM and HT. Binary logistic models further demonstrated that younger age and normal BMI were protective against both conditions, while tobacco use significantly increased the odds of DM (AOR: 2.45,p= 0.02). Multinomial logistic regression provided nuanced insights into overlapping risks, revealing that private or self‐employed individuals were substantially more likely to experience both DM and HT (RRR: 7.66,p< 0.001), a finding consistent with existing literature linking occupational stress to chronic disease burden during the pandemic. Together, these layered analyses underscore the complex interplay of demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors in chronic disease vulnerability, reinforcing the need to address both sociodemographic and biological determinants in the management of DM and HT among COVID‐19 patients. Figure1shows the directed acyclic graph of this study which will help to understand the relationship among factors.

Pandemics are influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental conditions, population density, and social behaviors [25]. Key elements such as climate, pollution, and age distribution can significantly impact the transmission rates of infectious diseases [26]. Additionally, socioeconomic disparities, healthcare infrastructure, and global interconnectedness also play vital roles in shaping pandemic dynamics [27]. In the case of COVID‐19, the virus spread rapidly due to factors like international travel, urban crowding, and delayed public health interventions [28,29]. Moreover, social determinants such as economic inequality and access to healthcare further exacerbated the outcomes of the pandemic [26].

Studies indicate that male sex is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID‐19 outcomes, potentially due to differences in immune responses and comorbidities, including DM and HT [25,26]. Males with DM and HT also show a greater likelihood of hospitalization and complications, highlighting sex as an important determinant in these conditions during the pandemic [29]. In the current study, males are significantly less likely to have HT compared to females, which contrasts with global trends where males generally exhibit higher susceptibility to HT during COVID‐19. It could be attributed to sociodemographic or cultural factors in the study population, such as differing healthcare access or health‐seeking behaviors between males and females, which may influence the diagnosis and management of HT. Age plays an important role in maintaining our health and physical activities. Studies have consistently shown that age plays a significant role in the prevalence and severity of DM and HT, with older adults being at higher risk due to physiological changes and cumulative exposure to risk factors [30,31]. In the current study, younger age groups were significantly less likely to have HT compared to those aged ≥ 50. Similarly, for DM, individuals aged 18–35 had a significantly lower likelihood compared to those aged ≥ 50. This aligns with global data showing increased susceptibility to chronic diseases among individuals aged 50 and above [32]. Occupation and income levels are well‐documented social determinants of health, influencing the prevalence and management of DM and HT due to disparities in access to healthcare and lifestyle factors [25,26]. Studies show that individuals in high‐stress occupations or with lower income levels are at greater risk of chronic diseases due to lifestyle behaviors and limited resources [29,33]. In the current study, private employees and self‐employed individuals had significantly higher odds of elevated SBP. Additionally, individuals with below‐average income were significantly less likely to have DM or HT compared to those earning > 35,000 BDT. These findings may reflect the impact of occupational stress and economic barriers in managing chronic diseases effectively.

BMI is a crucial determinant of health, strongly associated with the risk of developing DM and HT. Obesity, as indicated by a high BMI, is linked to increased insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, all of which exacerbate the risk of DM and HT [34,35]. Conversely, underweight individuals may also have distinct risks, such as poorer nutritional status and weakened vascular integrity, which could contribute to specific health challenges [36]. In the current study, individuals who were not obese had reduced odds of having elevated DBP compared to their obese counterparts. These findings align with global trends, where obesity is associated with increased DBP due to its effects on vascular resistance and cardiac output [37]. Tobacco use has been identified as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes in individuals with COVID‐19, DM, and HT. A systematic review and meta‐analysis found that both current and former smokers have a higher risk of severe COVID‐19 symptoms and mortality compared to never smokers [38]. Additionally, smoking is associated with increased insulin resistance and poor glycemic control, exacerbating DM, and contributes to the development and progression of HT through vascular damage and increased arterial stiffness [39]. In the current study, tobacco users were significantly more likely to have DM. This finding aligns with existing literature indicating that smoking exacerbates insulin resistance and impairs glycemic control, thereby increasing the risk of developing DM [39].

Elevated blood pressure is closely linked to both DM and HT, with SBP and DBP serving as critical indicators of cardiovascular health. SBP measures the pressure in arteries during heartbeats, while DBP measures the pressure between beats. Elevated SBP is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events, whereas elevated DBP is also associated with increased risk, particularly in younger individuals [14]. The relationship between SBP and DBP is complex; isolated systolic HT (elevated SBP with normal DBP) is common in older adults due to arterial stiffness, while isolated diastolic HT (elevated DBP with normal SBP) is more prevalent in younger populations [40,41]. Both forms are linked to an increased risk of developing DM and HT, as HT can lead to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction [42]. COVID‐19 has been shown to adversely affect blood pressure control, with studies indicating that patients with poorly controlled blood pressure before infection are at higher risk for severe outcomes, including hospitalization and mortality [43]. The virus's impact on the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system may contribute to BP dysregulation, further complicating management in patients with pre‐existing HT and DM [44]. In the current study, individuals with elevated DBP were significantly less likely to have elevated SBP. This inverse relationship may reflect a specific pattern of BP regulation in the study population, possibly influenced by factors such as medication adherence, lifestyle, or genetic predispositions. Further research is needed to explain the underlying causes of this finding.

In conclusion, this study underscores the multifactorial interplay between sociodemographic, biological, and behavioral determinants in shaping the epidemiological burden of DM and HT among COVID‐19 patients in the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh. The analysis highlights that endocrine dysregulation, psychosocial stressors (including anxiety and depression), and insufficient familial and spousal support significantly contribute to the pathophysiology and progression of HT. Similarly, the prevalence and glycemic control of DM are modulated by pathophysiological factors such as insulin resistance, neuroendocrine imbalances, and stress‐mediated metabolic disruptions, compounded by modifiable behavioral determinants like sedentary lifestyle, suboptimal dietary patterns, and limited access to preventive and curative healthcare services. These findings underscore the interaction between chronic NCDs and infectious diseases such as COVID‐19, particularly in resource‐constrained settings. They reinforce the necessity for precision public health strategies and integrated chronic disease management frameworks. Targeted interventions should prioritize high‐risk subpopulations, including older adults, males, individuals with high BMI, and tobacco users, through culturally tailored health promotion, community‐based screening, and strengthened primary healthcare delivery systems to mitigate adverse health outcomes during pandemics and beyond.

A major strength of this study lies in its focus on a regional population, providing critical, population‐specific insights that are highly relevant for local public health planning. The use of structured questionnaires and direct physical measurements enhances data reliability, minimizing measurement errors and strengthening the validity of the findings. While the study centers on COVID‐19, its insights may also be applicable to future pandemics involving respiratory viruses, especially in resource‐limited settings. The observed associations between chronic conditions and sociodemographic factors underscore enduring vulnerabilities that are likely to persist across similar public health emergencies.

However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The cross‐sectional design of this study limits the ability to infer causal relationships between risk factors and the prevalence of DM and HT. While logistic regression was employed to control confounding variables, unmeasured factors such as dietary habits, physical activity levels, genetic predispositions, psychosocial stress, medication adherence, and pre‐existing comorbidities (e.g., dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease) may still influence the results. The reliance on self‐reported data for variables like tobacco use, income, and stress levels introduces the potential for recall or reporting bias. Additionally, the sample may not fully represent the broader Bangladeshi population due to its regional focus, and voluntary participation. Future research using nationally representative, longitudinal designs with larger and more diverse samples is recommended to address these limitations and strengthen the evidence base.
