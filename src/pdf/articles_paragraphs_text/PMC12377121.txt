Thalassemia, a prevalent monogenic inherited disorder, represents a significant public health concern in southern China. This comprehensive study retrospectively analysed prenatal diagnostic data for thalassemia over an 11-year period in Guangdong Province, a high-prevalence region in southern China.

Prenatal diagnosis (PND) of thalassemia was performed on 22,127 foetuses from at-risk pregnancies, following standardized protocols for invasive sampling, foetal sample collection and laboratory processing. Thalassemia mutations were identified using PCR-based molecular techniques.

The analysis revealed that 16,812 cases (75.98%) were diagnosed with thalassemia, including 12,636 cases (57.11%) identified as α-thalassemia, 3961 cases (17.90%) as β-thalassemia and 215 cases (0.97%) as co-inheritance of α- and β-thalassemia. Among these, 5769 cases (26.08%) were diagnosed with intermedia or severe thalassemia genotypes, of which 2593 underwent pregnancy termination. Additionally, our study detected 275 cases of rare thalassemia variants. The retrospective analysis encompassed critical aspects including the timing of PND, genotype spectrum and rare variant identification, complemented by a synthesis of clinical practice insights.

This large-scale study provides substantial epidemiological data and clinical insights that significantly contribute to the enhancement of thalassemia prevention and control strategies in Guangdong Province.

Thalassemia, recognized as one of the most prevalent monogenic disorders, exhibits particularly high prevalence rates across Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia and southern China [1]. Epidemiological data reveal a substantial disease burden in China, where approximately 30 million individuals are estimated to be thalassemia carriers, with nearly 300,000 patients requiring medical intervention due to thalassemia major (TM) or intermedia [2]. The geographical distribution of thalassemia in China follows a distinct pattern, with the heaviest disease burden concentrated in regions south of the Yangtze River, particularly in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan provinces, which represent the highest prevalence areas [3].

Currently, the national strategy for thalassemia prevention and control in China focuses on two primary objectives: (1) the identification of high-risk couples through comprehensive carrier screening programs and (2) the reduction of diagnostic errors, including missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses. Invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) is generally preferred and has proven effective in preventing the birth of neonates with severe thalassemia [4]. Since establishing our thalassemia genetic diagnosis and PND program in 1996, our centre has developed extensive expertise in this specialized field. This single-centre, retrospective study analyses data from 22,127 foetuses derived from thalassemia at-risk pregnancies over an 11-year period. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to evaluate the outcomes of our intervention strategies while sharing valuable clinical insights gained from our substantial case experience.

This retrospective study analysed pregnancies at risk for thalassemia referred to our hospital between 2013 and 2023. Initial haematological and haemoglobin components testing were employed to detect individuals exhibiting phenotypic traits, with subsequent definitive genetic analysis for individuals with positive haematological indices. At-risk couples were defined as those in which both partners tested positive for thalassemia mutations, with a potential genetic risk of conceiving offspring affected by intermedia or severe thalassemia genotypes, such as Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis (homozygous α0-thalassemia), Hb H disease, homozygous β-thalassemia (β0or β+), Hb E-β-thalassemia, compound heterozygous β-thalassemia (β0/β0or β+/β+or β0/β+), unstable haemoglobin variants, etc. Following comprehensive genetic counselling, all participating couples provided written informed consent before undergoing invasive PND procedures for foetal sampling. Foetal sampling was performed using three standard techniques, all conducted under ultrasound guidance: (1) chorionic villus sampling (CVS) during 11 – 13 weeks of gestation, (2) amniocentesis at or beyond 18 weeks of gestation and (3) cordocentesis after 24 weeks of gestation. Concurrent with foetal sampling, parental peripheral blood samples were collected for maternal contamination exclusion and pedigree analysis. Our study population included both locally collected samples and referred cases from multiple healthcare facilities across Guangdong Province. The retrospective analysis encompassed 22,127 foetal samples that underwent thalassemia PND at our centre during the study period. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital (Approval No. [20251085]). This study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Prior to DNA extraction, all samples underwent pretreatment procedures tailored to their type. For chorionic villi samples, meticulous washing was performed using normal saline (twice) to eliminate potential maternal cell contamination (MCC). Under low magnification, parts of villi were carefully selected using tweezers for foetal DNA extraction, while the remaining tissue was preserved in saline solution and stored at −80 °C. Amniotic fluid samples were processed differently based on their visual characteristics. For samples without visible blood contamination, direct pretreatment was conducted. This involved centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min to separate amniotic fluid cells, followed by supernatant removal and pellet resuspension for DNA extraction. Conversely, blood-tinged amniotic fluid samples required prior culturing before pretreatment. These samples were cultured and harvested following the standard protocols. Cord blood samples were processed most directly, with 50 μL samples being immediately used for DNA extraction without additional pretreatment steps. This differential approach ensured optimal sample preparation for each tissue type while maintaining the integrity of the genetic material for subsequent analysis.

Haemoglobin components analysis was performed on cord blood samples obtained through cordocentesis using an automated capillary electrophoresis system (Capillarys 2, Sebia, Lisses, France), which was used to exclude MCC and facilitate clinical decision-making for complex cases. For genetic analysis, parental DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Lab-Aid 820 automation system (Zee San Biotech Company, Xiamen, China), while foetal DNA was extracted from chorionic villus, amniotic fluid or cord blood samples using the Qiagen DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA quality and concentration were quantitatively assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). MCC was systematically evaluated using short tandem repeat (STR)-based quantitative fluorescence-PCR (QF-PCR) [5]. For the molecular diagnosis of thalassemia, PCR-based methods were performed to detect twenty-three common α- and β-thalassemia mutations in southern Chinese populations, abnormal haemoglobin variants, rare single nucleotide variations (SNVs), rare deletions and copy number variants (CNVs), following established protocols [5–7].

To document the maternal and foetal outcomes, initial follow-up was conducted via telephone interviews one month post-PND. For pregnant women proceeding with pregnancy, including those with normal genotypes, silent carriers, trait carriers, and cases of intermedia or severe thalassemia genotypes who made informed decisions to continue gestation, additional follow-up was performed postnatally to monitor neonatal outcomes and clinical progression.

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Descriptive statistical methods were employed to characterize the distribution and frequency of thalassemia genotypes identified in the study population. For cases without risk of thalassemia intermedia (TI) or major genotypes, as well as those with inadequate foetal risk assessment data, the data were also analysed if PND was still performed.

During the study period, a total of 22,127 foetal samples were consecutively obtained. Of these samples, seven samples (including four amniotic fluid samples and three chorionic villus specimens) were excluded from analysis due to maternal contamination. Ultimately, 22,120 samples comprising CVS (n= 7398, 33.44%), amniotic fluid (n= 14,146, 63.95%) and cord blood (n= 576, 2.60%) were further examined. The annual distribution of PND procedures is presented inTable 1andFigure 1(A). As shown inFigure 1(A), PND procedures increased yearly, reaching their peak in 2017, followed by a subsequent decline. As demonstrated inFigure 1(B), the proportion of cases opting for CVS showed a marked upward trend, with its proportion increasing from 26.23% to 47.38% during the study period. Conversely, amniocentesis cases exhibited a steady annual decline beginning in 2017, while cordocentesis cases demonstrated a significant reduction, ultimately accounting for less than 1% of total procedures.

(B) Proportional distribution of invasive PND procedures conducted for thalassemia identification from 2013 to 2023. (C) Annual proportion of cases involving unnecessary PND requests and those with inadequate data for fetal risk assessment from 2013 to 2023. (D) Annual PND rates for rare thalassemia, including the number of at-risk couples and the number of foetuses diagnosed as positive for rare thalassemia variants from 2013 to 2023.

The study evaluated cases where PND was performed unnecessarily and with inadequate data for foetal risk assessment, as summarized inFigure 1andSupplementary Table 1. Specifically, 76 foetuses (0.34%) were identified as unnecessary PND cases due to both couples carrying silent thalassemia, while 66 cases (0.3%) were classified as having inadequate data for foetal risk assessment, primarily because one partner had unknown parental mutations. As illustrated inFigure 1(C), the annual proportion of PND requests showed an overall declining trend, despite some fluctuations observed during the study period.

Among the total 22,120 samples analysed, 16,812 cases (76%) tested positive for thalassemia. These included 12,636 (57.12%) cases of α-thalassemia, 3961 (17.91%) cases of β-thalassemia and 215 (0.97%) cases of co-inheritance of α- and β-thalassemia. The remaining 5308 cases (24%) were identified as normal foetuses (Figure 2(A)). In the α-thalassemia cohort, the genotypes were distributed as follows: 1522 (12.04%) were classified as thalassemia silent (TS), 6811 (53.90%) as thalassemia trait (TT), 1435 (11.36%) as TI and 2868 (22.70%) as TM (Figure 2(B)). Among the 3961 β-thalassemia cases, the genotypic distribution included 22 (0.56%) TS cases, 2554 (64.47%) TT cases, 467 (11.79%) TI cases and 918 (23.18%) TM cases (Figure 2(C)). For the 215 cases of co-inheritance of α- and β-thalassemia, the combinations were as follows: 134 cases (62.33%) involved α-TS combined with β-TT, α-TT combined with β-TS or α-TT combined with β-TT; 43 cases (20%) involved α-TI combined with β-TT, α-TS combined with β-TI, α-TT combined with β-TI or α-TI combined with β-TI; 38 cases (17.67%) involved α-TM combined with β-TT, α-TS combined with β-TM, α-TT combined with β-TM, α-TI combined with β-TM or α-TM combined with β-TM (Figure 2(D)). Overall, the study identified 11,043 (49.92%) thalassemia carriers (TS and TT), 5769 (26.08%) affected foetuses (TI and TM) and 5308 (24%) normal foetuses.

Table 1lists a comprehensive summary of the genotypes and their frequencies in thalassemia cases. Among the 12,636 α-thalassemia samples analysed, a total of 56 genotypes were identified. The most prevalent genotype was - -SEA/αα, detected in 6660 samples (52.71%), followed by - -SEA/- -SEA, which was observed in 2849 samples (22.55%). For β-thalassemia, a total of 107 genotypes were identified. The most frequent genotype was βCD41-42/βN, accounting for 25.50% (1010/3961) of cases. Other common genotypes included βIVS-count/βN(14.62%), β−28/βN(8.96%) and βCD17/βN(7.52%). In cases of co-inheritance of α- and β-thalassemia, 82 genotypes were identified. The most common genotype was - -SEA/αα combined with βCD41-42/βN(28/215, 13.02%), followed by - -SEA/αα combined with β−28/βNand -α3.7/αα combined with βCD41-42/βN, each representing 6.98% (15/215) of cases.

A total of 493 at-risk couples carrying rare thalassemia variants were identified, resulting in a PND rate of 2.23% (493/22,120). The annual PND rates for rare thalassemia, along with the number of at-risk couples and positive foetuses from 2013 to 2023, are illustrated inFigure 1(D). Between 2013 and 2018, the annual PND rate for rare thalassemia fluctuated between 1.13% and 1.90%, consistently remaining below 2%. The number of PND cases peaked in 2020 with 67 instances, while the PND rate reached its highest level of 4.07% in 2022. Among the 493 at-risk couples, 275 foetuses were identified with rare variants, including 156 foetuses with α-globin gene variants and 119 foetuses with β-globin gene variants. The most prevalent alleles of the α- and β-globin gene were HKαα (53/156, 33.97%) and ChineseGγ+(Aγδβ)0(48/119, 40.34%), respectively. Additionally, this study identified 45 samples with 17 genotypes exhibiting abnormal haemoglobin variants, including nine variant types in theHBA1orHBA2genes and six variant types in theHBBgene. The most frequently detected variant was Hb Q-Thailand, representing 53.33% of all abnormal haemoglobin variants.

All 13,235 cases sampled at our hospital were successfully followed up. Among these, 2593 pregnancies were terminated in time following PND, including 1542 cases of Hb Bart’s disease, 486 cases of β-TM, 300 cases of haemoglobin H disease, and 265 cases of β-TI. All pregnancies involving normal foetuses, as well as those carrying TS or TT genotypes, were continued. Additionally, 419 foetuses diagnosed with haemoglobin H disease and 16 foetuses with β-thalassemia (15 with β-TI and one with β-TM) also chose to continue their pregnancies. The second postpartum telephone follow-up revealed varying degrees of anaemia and jaundice in 13 infants with haemoglobin H disease. Among these, two infants required blood transfusions (genotypes: - -SEA/-α4.2and - -SEA/αQSα), two infants died postnatally (genotypes: - -SEA/-α4.2and - -SEA/αQSα) and a case (genotype: - -SEA/-α3.7) presented with growth delay, delayed motor development, fatigability and poor physical condition. In the β-thalassemia cohort, none of the infants with β-TI exhibited thalassemia-related phenotypes at follow-up. However, the one infant with β-TM exhibited signs of growth delay and required monthly blood transfusions. The patient subsequently underwent stem cell transplantation in 2023.

Thalassemia is highly prevalent in Guangdong province, with a carrier rate of 16.8% reported by Yin et al. [8]. Given Guangdong’s population of approximately 126.01 million (as per the seventh Chinese population census), 21.17 million individuals are estimated carriers. The disease imposes a significant burden on families and society, with patients requiring blood transfusions every 26.7 days on average and annual treatment costs exceeding $13,000 [2]. National and provincial programs focusing on carrier screening, genetic counselling and PND for at risk families [2,8 – 11]. In recent years, these efforts have led to a decline in the birth of neonates with moderate to severe thalassemia. In this study, we identified 11,043 carriers (TS and TT) and 5769 affected foetuses (TI and TM), confirming PND’s efficacy.

From 2013 to 2017, the number of PND procedures increased steadily, but a decline was observed after 2017. This trend may be attributed to the establishment of additional PND institutions, reducing the need for referrals to our centre, as well as a declining birth rate in the population. Our analysis also revealed a shift in the timing of invasive PND procedure. CVS has become increasingly preferred, while amniocentesis and cordocentesis declined. By the end of the study period, CVS and amniocentesis were equally utilized, with cordocentesis accounting for only a small proportion of procedures. This contrasts with findings from Fujian province, where amniocentesis remains the predominant method [12]. CVS, initially underused due to technical complexity [13], now shows similar safety to amniocentesis [14,15]. At our centre, CVS has been employed as a PND method for thalassemia since 1996. CVS enables earlier diagnosis, reducing psychological and physical trauma from late-term terminations. At our centre, cordocentesis is now used sparingly in clinical practice due to its limitations of late gestational application and elevated foetal loss rates [16,17]. It remains useful for third-trimester cases or ambiguous genetic results. For instance, third-trimester pregnancies requiring rapid Hb electrophoresis when severe thalassemia is suspected. Furthermore, for complex β-thalassemia cases (homozygous or compound heterozygous with variants of uncertain significance (VUS)) with inconclusive ultrasound findings, Hb electrophoresis results from cordocentesis can offer critical insights to guide clinical decision-making. These applications demonstrate its continued role in managing late-presenting or complex thalassemia cases.

Our routine PND practice revealed cases not meeting established criteria, including unnecessary procedures for silent thalassemia couples and those with insufficient data for foetal risk assessment. While genetic counselling generally addresses for non-severe thalassemia risks, some providers’ limited expertise continues to drive unnecessary PND, despite documented complications [18,19]. Some pregnant women may request concomitant thalassemia gene testing during prenatal procedures for other indications (e.g. chromosomal analysis), leading to thalassemia PND. A prior study [20] found that only 27.5% of such cases resulted in a diagnosis of severe thalassemia, emphasizing the need to confirm parental thalassemia genotypes before proceeding with PND. Notably, improved provider training has reduced both unnecessary PND and inadequate data cases, reflecting optimized genetic counselling protocols and better thalassemia management practices.

Molecular testing of invasive PND requires critical avoidance of MCC. Our centre has extensive sample pretreatment experience to minimize MCC risk. This includes meticulous selection and micro-dissection of villi with tweezers to remove suspected maternal tissue. For amniotic fluid samples with visible blood contamination, a previous study recommended multiple centrifugation and washing steps as a simple, feasible MCC reduction method [21]. However, these steps are subjective and may lead to sample loss. Based on our experience, cell culture is essential for processing blood-contaminated amniotic fluid samples. We also recommend testing both foetal and maternal DNA to detect MCC. These measures have proven effective in mitigating MCC and ensuring accurate and reliable molecular analysis results.

Our genotypic findings show higher α-thalassemia prevalence than β-thalassemia, consistent with prior Guangdong and Fujian research [22,23]. Conversely, Guangxi research reported slight difference between α-thalassemia (55.77%) and β-thalassemia (43.00%) carrier rates [24], highlighting significant regional variations in genotype distribution. While the overall thalassemia prevalence in our study was lower than a 2022 Guangdong epidemiological survey (82.55%) [22], our results may be more reliable due to the larger sample size. Specifically, we identified 11,043 carriers (49.92%, TS/TT), 5769 affected foetuses (26.08%, TI/TM) and 5308 normal foetuses (24%). These proportions closely match the 2:1:1 theoretical ratio expected for a recessive genetic disorder. The molecular basis of thalassemia exhibits complexity and variability across populations. Our study found the most frequent α-thalassemia genotypes included - -SEA/αα, - -SEA/- -SEAand - α3.7/αα, consistent with other southern Chinese regions [12,21,22]. For β-thalassemia, the most prevalent mutations were βCD41-42/, βIVS--42β-/, β−28/and βCD17, consistent with southern Chinese mutation frequency patterns [2]. Leveraging the substantial sample size of this study, we identified a broader spectrum of α- and β-thalassemia co-inheritance genotypes. A total of 82 co-inherited genotypes were documented. These findings underscore the value of large-scale studies in revealing broader genotype spectrum.

Genetic analysis techniques such as multiple gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR), reverse dot-blot (RDB) assay and PCR-flow fluorescence hybridization technology are commonly used for detecting common thalassemia mutations [5]. However, approximately, 2% of rare variants in globin genes may be missed, potentially causing misdiagnosis/missed diagnosis [1]. Thus, accurate genetic diagnosis of suspected rare cases is crucial for effective rare thalassemia PND. Advances enable techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Sanger sequencing and long-read single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing in our centre. Despite utility, these methods have limitations [25]. For example, while advantageous, SMRT sequencing still has shortcomings. Our team found SMRT sequencing may rely on the MLPA results to design primers and amplify target regions for sequencing [26]. This 11-year study involved 493 at-risk couples with rare variants undergoing PND. Before 2019, the annual PND rate for rare types was less than 2%, still exceeding than earlier studies [25]. After 2019, the rate increased significantly, largely due to adopting advanced techniques. We identified diverse rare variants, including relatively common types in southern China (e.g. HKαα/, - -THAI/, ChineseGγ+(Aγδβ)0, Hb Q-Thailand, SEA-HPFH and Hb New York) and novel or complex variants. Detailed pedigrees were reported, including SNVs, rare deletions, structural variants in the globin gene cluster, and unstable haemoglobin variants [5,6,27 – 30]. Different variants require specific methods, our work highlights combining multiple techniques for accurate diagnosis. In clinical practice, two major challenges persist in the genetic counselling and PND of thalassemia. First, avoiding misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of rare cases. Clinicians must proactively identify these cases during genetic counselling, especially when genotypes cannot explain the haematological indices. Here, supplementary molecular testing is needed to avoid misdiagnosis or missed PND. Second, counselling patients with novel rare variants in globin genes. Without relevant literature, assessing carriers’ haematological phenotypes in the family provides insights. Additionally, as above, Hb electrophoresis results from cord blood samples can aid in clinical decision-making for complex cases. In brief, precise genetic diagnosis is essential for guiding clinicians in PND and reproductive genetic counselling.

As the largest thalassemia PND study in Guangdong Province to date, our findings show progress in key areas. First, targeted health education improved thalassemia knowledge/awareness among healthcare professionals and the public. Second, widespread screening during premarital, prepregnancy and prenatal exams increased the detection rates of carriers and affected individuals. Third, technical capacity for invasive PND and genetic testing advanced, improving tertiary and primary healthcare. Finally, national and provincial prevention and control programs supported carrier screening and PND services, ensuring accessibility for Guangdong residents.

Despite achievements, study limitations exist. For instance, pregnancy outcome follow-up data were mainly collected through telephone interviews, potentially missing clinical outcomes or long-term effects. Additionally, samples in this study were primarily from high-prevalence region. Although thalassemia carriers exist elsewhere, our limited geographic scope prevents comprehensive analysis of thalassemia gene carrier distribution and public health implications across these areas. In conclusion, this retrospective study, encompassing all foetuses prenatally diagnosed with thalassemia between 2013 and 2023, provides valuable insights into Guangdong’s thalassemia prevention and control. The data provide a scientific basis for developing targeted prevention and control strategies.
