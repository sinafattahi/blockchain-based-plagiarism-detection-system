Accurate quantification of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is essential for regulatory compliance, especially under threshold-based labeling policies. In this study, we developed and validated twelve event-specific duplex chamber- or chip-based digital PCR (cdPCR) methods using microfluidic array plates to quantify GM maize events approved in South Korea. In contrast to conventional real-time PCR, the cdPCR approach allows for absolute quantification without standard curve calibration and incorporates event-specific zygosity ratio correction to improve accuracy of the measurement. The method was evaluated at GMO content levels of 0.9%, 3.0%, and 5.0%. It demonstrated high sensitivity and robustness, with trueness, precision, and reproducibility satisfying the minimum performance criteria recommended by international guidelines. Comparative analysis with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed comparable accuracy; however, cdPCR provided advantages in cost-efficiency and operational simplicity. These findings support the applicability of duplex cdPCR as a practical and reliable tool for GMO quantification, particularly in national regulatory laboratories and for enforcement of labeling thresholds such as Korea’s 3.0% rule.

As an alternative, digital PCR (dPCR) has emerged as a next-generation method for absolute quantification of nucleic acids. In dPCR, the reaction mixture is partitioned into thousands of independent reactions, and after amplification, each partition is classified as positive or negative. The absolute quantity of the target is then calculated using Poisson statistics.16,17One major advantage of dPCR over qPCR is that it enables absolute quantification without the need for standard curve calibration, thereby improving reproducibility and reducing operator dependency, particularly when working with low target concentrations.18,19Due to these advantages, dPCR has been widely applied to the detection and quantification of GMOs in recent years.

The objective of this study is to develop and validate a duplex cd PCR method for the absolute quantification of twelve GM maize events approved in South Korea. The selection of the 12 GM maize events in this study was based on their regulatory approval for food, feed, or industrial use in South Korea and their relevance to ongoing domestic monitoring programs. The assay aims to support regulatory enforcement of the 3.0% labeling threshold for GMOs4by enabling precise quantification without calibration curves and by incorporating experimentally determined zygosity ratios for each GM event. We applied the QuantStudio Absolute Q™ system, which simplifies the dPCR workflow by using pre-manufactured microfluidic chamber plates. Furthermore, our method was evaluated through blind sample testing at regulatory threshold levels (0.9%, 3.0%, and 5.0%) using both cdPCR and qPCR. The results demonstrate that duplex cdPCR is a robust and practical approach for accurate GMO quantification in support of national monitoring and inspection efforts.

Twelve GM maize events – DAS01131-3, DAS40278-9, DP004114-3, DP023211-2, DP051291-1, DP098140-6, DP202216-6, MON87403-1, MON87411-9, MON87429-9, MON87460-4, and MON88017-3—and their corresponding non-GM reference materials were provided by the respective developers for in-house method verification conducted at the Biosafety Division of the NIAS, South Korea. Detailed information on each GM maize event, including the approval year in South Korea, intended use (food, feed, or industrial), trait characteristics, and developer, is provided in Supplemental Table S1.

Maize seeds (both GM and non-GM) were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted and purified using the Maxwell RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and double-stranded DNA content was quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Event-specific primers and probes, as well as those targeting the endogenous reference genehigh mobility group a(hmg, GenBank accession no.AJ131373.1), were provided by the respective applicants in accordance with the national regulatory requirements under the LMO ACT of South Korea, which obliges GM developers to submit molecular characterization and detection information for official method verification. The Sequences and target regions are listed inTable 1. They are also publicly available in international databases such as International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) and EUginus. For certain GM maize events such as DP004114–3 and DP023211–2, the primers and probes used in this study differ from those specified in the EURL-GMFF validated methods (e.g., QT-EVE-ZM-035 and QT-TAX-ZM-008). Probes targeting GM events were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), whilehmgprobes were labeled with either FAM or VIC. The 3′ ends of the probes were modified with either TAMRA or non-fluorescent quencher-minor groove bindeer (NFQ-MGB). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, South Korea).

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using the QuantStudio 1 Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher, Foster City, CA, USA) to establish calibration curves for the DP023211–2 event. Each 25 μL reaction contained 12.5 μL of 2X Qplex Master Mix (CellSafe, Yougin, South Korea), primers, probes, 10 μL of template DNA, and nuclease-free water. The reagents are detailed in Supplemental Table S2. Two zygosity ratios were applied to calibrate the DNA mixtures: 0.42 (provided by the applicant) and 0.13 (experimentally determined by cdPCR in this study), to simulate 10% GM content based on copy number ratios. The calibration curves were established on at five samples with four experimental replicates. The first point of the calibration curve (S1) was established for a sample containing 10% maize DP023211–2 DNA in a total of 300 ng of non-GM maize DNA. Standards S2 to S5 are prepared by serial dilutions (dilution factor 4 for S2, S4 and S5, and dilution factor 3 for S3). The corresponding amount of DNA in reaction and copy numbers for standard curves are listed in Supplemental Table S3.31Thermal cycling conditions were 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The same thermal protocol was used for both the DP023211–2 andhmgassays. Blind samples containing 0.9%, 3.0%, and 5.0% GM content were prepared by mixing DP023211–2 DNA with non-GM maize DNA at the corresponding copy number ratios. Copy numbers were calculated from Ct values based on the standard curves. GMO content was expressed as the ratio of DP023211–2 tohmgcopy numbers. Accuracy was evaluated as relative bias, and precision was assessed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) from four technical replicates.

Simplex and duplex cdPCR assays were performed using the QuantStudio Absolute Q™ Digital PCR System (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher) with 16-well microfluidic array plates (MAP). Reaction mixtures followed the manufacturer’s protocol. For simplex assays, each 9 μL reaction included 2 μL of 5X Absolute Q™ DNA Digital PCR Master Mix, 5 μL of template DNA (1 ng/µl), 0.9 μL of primer mix (10 μM), 0.25 μL of probe (10 μM), and 1.4 μL of distilled water. For duplex assays, the same master mix and DNA volumes were used, with two sets of primers and probes (total 2.3 μL), and 0.7 μL of water. Each well was loaded with 9 μL of reaction mixture and overlaid with 15 μL of separation oil (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A52730), followed by placement of a sealing gasket. Each well contained 20,480 fixed microchambers. Thermal cycling was carried out at 96°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 96°C for 5 s and 60°C for 15 s. Fluorescence signals were analyzed using the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR instrument and QuantStudio Analysis Suite Cloud Software. Zygosity ratios for each GM event were calculated using duplex cdPCR by measuring the ratio of event-specific target copy number tohmgcopy number in GM DNA samples. Blind DNA mixtures at 0.9%, 3.0%, and 5.0% GM content were analyzed to evaluate the method’s performance in quantifying low-level GMO content using cdPCR. Four experimental replications were run for each cdPCR analysis.

GMO quantification is based on the ratio of transgene to endogenous gene copy numbers. Therefore, simultaneous detection within a single reaction mixture using duplex PCR is both practical and cost-effective. To evaluate this, we compared the performance of simplex and duplex cdPCR for two GM maize events:DAS01131–3 and DP910521–2. In the simplex assay, the FAM reporter dye was used to detect both the transgene and thehmgendogenous gene. The measured copy numbers forDAS01131–3 and DP910521–2 transgenes were 439.09 and 427.45 copies/μL, respectively, whilehmgcopy numbers were 1048.41 and 1174.39 copies/μL (Table 2). To assess any dye-related bias,hmgquantification was performed using both FAM and VIC dyes. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the two fluorophores (FAM, 1048.41 copies/μL; VIC, 1077.4 copies/μL), as determined by a Student’s t-test (p> .05), indicating that dye selection did not influencehmgquantification.

Accurate digital PCR requires efficient partitioning. The MAP 16 Digital PCR Plate used in this study contains 20,480 fixed microchambers per well. The observed positive chamber counts exceeded 20,400, indicating even partitioning. In duplex cdPCR, FAM was used for transgene detection and VIC forhmg. The resulting copy numbers were statistically comparable to those obtained from simplex assays, with no significant difference observed based on Student’s t-test (p> .05), confirming that amplification efficiency was not influenced by dye type or reaction format. These findings validate the use of duplex cdPCR for GMO quantification.

Determination of the zygosity ratio of the non-GM maize is critical for expressing GM content as a haploid genome copy ratio, as emphasized in EU guide lines.32–34Maize has a complex tissue structure with variable DNA contributions from maternal and paternal genomes, depending on the hybrid type. The zygosity ratio can vary depending on the donor parent of the transgene and specific seed tissue composition, such as the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat.35Corbisier et al.34reported that the copy number ratios between GM event-specific targets and taxon-specific reference genes varied notably among 17 certified GM maize reference materials using ddPCR. The observed conversion factors ranged from 0.34 to 0.68, depending on the parental origin of the transgene (male vs. female donor), endosperm contribution, and potential differences in DNA extractability from seed tissues. In line with these findings, our study also showed the zygosity ratio ranged from 0.134 (DP023211–3) to 0.625 (DP202216–6) (Table 3), indicating hemizygous GM maize materials.

Our results were compared with zygosity ratio values available in the applicant’s reference protocols and the validation report of the GM maize event by the EURL-GMFF (Supplemental Table S4). Among the 12 GM maize events tested, the most notable discrepancies between experimentally determined and reference zygosity ratios were observed in DP023211–2 and DP202216–6. For DP023211–2, the duplex cdPCR method yielded a zygosity ratio of 0.134 (mean of four replicates), while the applicant’s documentation reported a value of 0.42. Similarly, DP202216–6 showed experimentally determined ratios of 0.625, compared to values of 0.99 reported by the EURL-GMFF. In these cases, the reference values were provided as single figures without replicate data or accompanying measures of variability (e.g., standard deviation), precluding formal statistical comparison (e.g., t-test). Nevertheless, the relative differences – ranging from 36% to over 68%—are substantial and analytically meaningful. These discrepancies likely reflect differences in seed batch composition, parental genotype, hybrid type, or tissue-specific DNA content, all of which can influence the effective zygosity ratio observed in quantitative PCR-based analyses.34To account for such variation, this study applied duplex cdPCR to determine zygosity ratios directly from seed-derived DNA, enabling a material-specific correction for each event. This approach ensures more accurate quantification when CRMs are unavailable, not matrix-matched, or exhibit batch-to-batch variability.

To further investigate the impact of the zygosity ratio on quantification, we established a standard curve using qPCR with DNA templates adjusted to match the expected copy ratios corresponding to the two distinct zygosity ratios of DP023211–2. The average slope of the standard curve should range from −3.1 to −3.6, corresponding to an efficiency between 90% and 110%, and the R2coefficient should be ≥ 0.99, according to the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL) method acceptance criteria (2008). When using the zygosity ratio of 0.43 provided by the applicants, the slope, R2, and efficiency values met the ENGL criteria. However, the Ct value showed high variation at the lowest concentration (S5) of DP023211–2 (Supplemental Fig. S1D). In contrast, when using the zygosity ratio of 0.13 measured via cdPCR in this study, the slope, R2, and efficiency values met the ENGL criteria, and the Ct value exhibited less variation across the five concentrations (Figure 1(B,E)). These results indicate that a zygosity ratio of 0.43 led to an underestimation of GM quantity, affecting PCR amplification efficiency, particularly at the lowest concentration.

(E) DP023211–2 blind samples expected transgene contents of 0.9%, 3.0%, and 5.0% on the DP023211–2 standard curve. A zygosity ratio of 0.13 was applied to calculate the copy number ratio. Data were means from four replicates.

The DP02311–3 event-specific andhmgqPCR analyses were performed to quantify blind DNA samples with GM levels of 5.0%, 3.0%, and 0.9% (expressed as the % copy number ratio of DP02311–3 tohmg). The measured copy numbers of the DP02311–3 event-specific target andhmg, as well as the % copy number ratio of DP02311–3 tohmg, are shown inTable 4. The measured GMO % was determined as the ratio of the average copy number of DP02311–3 to that ofhmg.

aEach value is an average of four experimental replications, except for Bias and RSD. Bias, deviation from expected value; RSD, relative standard deviation.

According to the minimum performance requirements for GMO analytical methods, the measured value must have a relative bias of ± 25% (trueness) and precision in terms of a relative standard deviation (RSD) of ≤ 25%.26,28The measured % copy number ratios were 0.87%, 3.01%, and 5.09%, which were close to the expected values (Table 4). For all blind samples, the % bias and % RSD of the measured copy number ratios were below 5%. The measured copy numbers and Ct values of the DP02311–3 event-specific target in blind DNA samples were well-aligned with the standard curves ofhmgand DP02311–3 (Figure 1(C,E)), indicating that the qPCR assays precisely measured the % copy number ratio in blind samples.

Unlike qPCR, digital PCR (dPCR) enables absolute quantification of the target without the need for a standard curve. Several studies demonstrated that ddPCR platforms provide high analytical performance for regulatory testing of GM events in maize, soybean, and canola.15,22,36–39For instance, Dobnik et al.21developed two multiplex ddPCR assays to quantify up to twelve GM maize events simultaneously, achieving limit of quantification (LOQ) as low as 0.058% and bias within ± 25%. Li et al.38developed an event-specific duplex ddPCR in DBN9936 maize, demonstrating accurate quantification across blind matrix and genomic DNA samples with RSD and bias within ± 25%. While the ddPCR method typically require emulsification steps and specialized droplet readers, in this study the cdPCR method utilizes pre-fabricated microfluidic plates and eliminates droplet generation, thereby reducing operational complexity.

Quantification of the DP023211–2 blind samples using cdPCR analysis. DNA samples from DP023211–2 positive and negative control were mixed to obtain final transgene contents of 100%, 5.0%, 3.0%, and 0.09%. The mixed DNA samples were used as a template to amplify the transgene (A) andhmg(B) on the cdPCR platform.

Both DP02311–3 andhmgqPCR and duplex cdPCR accurately quantified GMO content (Table 4). However, the results of this study differ from previous reports suggesting that dPCR exhibits higher precision than qPCR in GMO quantification.24,38In this study, qPCR quantification was conducted after multiple independent runs to adjust DNA concentration, as well as primer and probe concentrations and ratios, to meet the acceptable criteria set by the ENGL.28In contrast, cdPCR analysis was performed without such optimization trials, which may explain the higher precision observed in the qPCR results. Additionally, the amount of template DNA used for the blind samples (5.0%, 3.0%, and 0.9%) in qPCR was 150 ng, 90 ng, and 27 ng, respectively, which was significantly higher than the 0.225 ng, 0.135 ng, and 0.0405 ng used in cdPCR. Therefore, duplex cdPCR is a more cost- and time-efficient method without the need for standard curves or extensive optimization steps. Moreover, it enables accurate quantification even in samples with low GMO content, demonstrating its practical applicability. Schematic representations of the developed qPCR and duplex cdPCR analyses to quantify GM maize content were presented inFigure 3.

The established cdPCR method was further applied to quantify the GM maize blind samples (0.9%, 3.0%, and 5.0%) in eleven maize events. The results for the target genes (DAS01131-3, DAS40278-9, DP004114-3, DP051291-1, DP098140-6, DP202216–6, MON87403-1, MON87411-9, MON87429-9, MON87460–4, and MON88017-3) andhmgcdPCR quantification are shown inTable 5. The GM content was determined as the ratio of the average copy number of the transgene to that ofhmg, divided by the zygosity ratio (Table 2). The measured GM % for each maize event was similar to the expected value. The precision and trueness of quantification were within the limits established by the ENGL,28except forDAS01131–3 and MON88017–3. The 0.9%DAS01131–3 sample was measured as 0.721%, with an RSD of 27.89% and a bias of −19.88%, while the 0.9% MON88017–3 sample was measured as 0.669%, with an RSD of 30.38% and a bias of −16.41%. Increased % RSD and % bias in PCR-based GMO quantification analyses were observed in samples with concentrations approaching the minimum value tested, which is consistent with previous reports.8,15,38Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine whether increasing the template amount for the 5.0%, 3.0%, and 0.9% blind samples in cdPCR reduces % RSD and % bias. Nevertheless, this study showed that cdPCR achieved accurate and precise quantification of GM content at 3.0%, a GMO labeling threshold in South Korea4without optimization trials, while qPCR required multiple optimization steps (e.g. DNA input, primer/probe concentration) to meet ENGL criteria (data not shown).

Additionally, GM content was calculated using a zygosity ratio of 0.5, assuming that maize is in the market predominantly as a hybrid trait (Supplemental Table S5). For some GMO contents ofDAS01131–3, DP04114–3, DP023211–2, DP051291–1, DP202216–6, MON87411–9, and MON88017–3, the % RSD and % bias did not meet the acceptance criteria, indicating that accurate determination of the zygosity ratio is crucial for precise GMO quantification.

In conclusion, duplex cdPCR demonstrated comparable performance to qPCR in quantifying DP023211–3. Determination of the zygosity ratio of GM DNA samples was crucial for accurate quantification of GM content. The duplex cdPCR method achieved accurate quantification of twelve GM maize events at GMO levels as low as 0.9% and successfully quantified 3.0% and 5.0% GM content with good precision and trueness. These findings demonstrate the duplex cdPCR method is straightforward and does not require additional optimization trials, unlike qPCR, which requires standard curve establishment. While the present study focused on key performance metrics such as accuracy and precision, we acknowledge that a comprehensive in-house validation will be necessary to support broader regulatory application. Future work will therefore include a full validation of the method in accordance with ENGL and other international guidelines, addressing essential parameters such as limit of detection (LOD), LOQ, robustness, and reproducibility. We also plan to explore participation in inter-laboratory ring trials to further assess the method’s reliability and transferability.
