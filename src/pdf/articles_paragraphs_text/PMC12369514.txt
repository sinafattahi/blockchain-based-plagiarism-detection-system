We have read with great interest the article by Wu et al. on the impact of rocuronium–sugammadex in orthognathic surgery [1]. The aim of optimizing postoperative recovery is commendable. However, our review of the manuscript has revealed several significant and concerning inconsistencies in the reporting of key outcome data, which preclude a clear interpretation of the study’s results and conclusions.

The most troubling inconsistency pertains to the data for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Before propensity score matching, the rocuronium/sugammadex group (n= 77) is reported to have 15 PONV cases (19.5%). After matching, this group was reduced to a subset of 73 patients, yet the number of PONV cases is reported to have increased to 21 (28.8%). This is a mathematical impossibility, as a subset cannot contain more instances of an event than its parent set. This suggests a fundamental error in data reporting that requires immediate attention.

This issue appears to be part of a wider pattern of inconsistent data reporting across other key outcomes. For instance, the median length of hospital stay for the rocuronium/sugammadex group is cited as 3 days in the abstract but as 4 days in Table 2 of the original article and throughout the post-matching analysis. Similarly, the sevoflurane consumption values and their statistical significance presented in the results text (10.63 mL/h for the sugammadex group,p= 0.002) do not align with the data presented in Table 2 of the original article (12.24 mL/h,p= 0.044). This pattern of conflicting information undermines confidence in the entire dataset.

Furthermore, even if these data errors were to be corrected, the study’s conclusions are challenged by significant unmeasured confounding factors inherent in its design [2]. The self-pay model for sugammadex introduces a critical socioeconomic confounder. It is highly plausible that patients with the financial means to select a self-pay reversal agent would also opt for other advanced, self-pay technologies, such as Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring for anesthetic depth. The use of BIS would offer a direct mechanistic explanation for the observed finding of lower sevoflurane and higher opioid consumption in the sugammadex group, as clinicians could more confidently titrate volatile anesthetics downward [3]. The authors, however, did not report on the use of any anesthetic depth monitoring, leaving this critical potential confounder unaddressed.

This lack of methodological transparency is mirrored in the evaluation of other key outcomes. For instance, the study provides no standardized discharge criteria, making the "length of stay" outcome highly subjective and susceptible to the same socioeconomic biases that likely influenced the choice of monitoring.

Therefore, we believe it is crucial for the authors to provide a clarification and, if necessary, a formal correction of these data. Until such clarification and correction are provided, we suggest that the study’s conclusions should be interpreted with considerable caution.
