Rebamipide is a gastric mucosal protectant used to relieve gastritis symptoms. Real‐world evidence on the comparative effectiveness of rebamipide monotherapy versus combination therapy with proton‐pump inhibitors (PPIs) in routine clinical settings is limited. This study evaluated the effect of rebamipide in reducing subjective gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms among patients with gastritis symptoms using a patient‐focused approach. This multicenter, observational study enrolled patients aged 19 years and older who were prescribed rebamipide for gastritis symptoms across 81 local clinics and hospitals. Patients received rebamipide twice daily for 2 weeks, with an optional 4‐week extension. GI symptom severity and frequency were collected via patient‐reported outcomes at baseline and posttreatment. Patients were categorized into a rebamipide monotherapy group and a combination therapy group, with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) applied to adjust for baseline confounding. Statistical analyses included ANCOVA for symptom score changes and chi‐square tests for categorical symptom improvement. Of the 2209 patients included in the analysis, 1946 were in the monotherapy and 263 were in the combination therapy. Both treatment groups showed significant posttreatment reductions in GI symptom scores, and there was no significant difference between the two groups in severity, frequency, and total score before and after IPTW (p> 0.05). The symptom improvement rate (≥ 50% reduction) was 71.5% in the monotherapy group and 71.4% in the combination therapy group, with no significant difference between the two groups (p= 0.976). Rebamipide monotherapy provided similar levels of GI symptom relief compared to combination therapy with PPIs in a real‐world clinical setting.

Gastritis is defined as an inflammation of the stomach lining, which can be either acute or chronic based on its onset or duration [1,2]. In routine clinical practice, however, the diagnosis of gastritis is primarily made based on patient‐reported clinical symptoms rather than endoscopic or histological findings. Often presented with symptoms like heartburn, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, gastritis is one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions in adult patients, with the prevalence increasing over time. There are various therapeutic options available for treating gastritis as follows: globally marketed drugs include mucosal protectants, antacids, histamine‐2 receptor antagonists, and proton‐pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Rebamipide is a commonly prescribed gastric mucosal protectant to treat gastritis [3]. It promotes the synthesis of prostaglandins and mucin glycoproteins, thereby inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines, and suppressing leukocyte activity, which in turn facilitates the healing of gastric mucosa [4,5,6,7,8]. Conventionally, rebamipide dosage for adults was 100‐mg tablet(s) three times daily; a rebamipide sustained‐release (SR) tablet was developed to reduce the dosing frequency to twice daily, aiming to improve treatment outcomes by reducing the burden of frequent dosing and improving patient compliance.

The PPIs, on the other hand, are widely used to inhibit gastric acid secretion, which in turn protects the gastric mucosa and alleviates the symptoms of gastritis. However, long‐term use of PPIs can increase the risks of certain adverse effects such as atrophic gastritis and argyrophil cell hyperplasia inHelicobacter pylori‐positive patients [9]. To address these limitations, mucosal protective agents such as rebamipide are often used as adjunctive therapies. Studies have suggested that combination therapy with PPIs and rebamipide may further accelerate ulcer healing and provide comprehensive symptom control for gastritis [10].

In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was passed in the United States of America, which was designed to help accelerate medical product development and approval by incorporating patient perspectives in drug development and regulatory processes and modernizing clinical trials [11]. The Act strongly encourages the use of Real‐World Data (RWD) and Real‐World Evidence to improve drug development efficiency and to aid the regulatory decision‐making process. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), RWD refers to data related to patient health status and/or healthcare delivery, routinely collected from various sources. Examples of RWD include data obtained in real clinical settings, such as electronic medical records and electronic health records, administrative and healthcare claims data, personal life logs (e.g., personal records, biometric data), or registries [12].

Recently, the importance of patient‐focused drug development, a systematic approach to helping ensure that patients' experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development and evaluation, has been emphasized as a critical aspect of the drug development process [13,14,15]. Patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) are defined as measurements based on reports that come directly from the patient about the status of a patient's health condition without interpretation of the patient's response by a clinician or anyone else [13,16]. A PRO can be measured by self‐report or by interview, provided that the interviewer records only the patient's response. Symptoms or other unobservable concepts known only to the patient can only be measured by PRO measures. For example, for a gastritis patient, the symptoms, functions (e.g., cognitive function), and quality of life perceived by the patient are critical factors in determining the effectiveness of treatment; therefore, all these factors can be considered as PROs.

Despite the potential benefits of combination therapy of rebamipide with PPIs, it remains unclear whether rebamipide monotherapy alone could relieve gastritis symptoms at comparable levels to the combination therapy with PPIs in real‐world clinical settings. Most clinical trials emphasize endoscopic or histological outcomes, often underestimating patient‐centered symptomatic improvements. Our study has utilized PROs to assess subjective symptoms in gastritis patients under routine clinical care instead of endoscopic or histological endpoints. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rebamipide monotherapy compared to combination therapy of rebamipide and PPIs in managing gastritis symptoms, using real‐world data.

This study was designed as a multicenter, prospective observational study. We enrolled patients aged 19 years and above with subjective symptoms who were prescribed rebamipide SR tablets for treating acute or chronic gastritis at 81 local clinics and hospitals in South Korea. All patients received 150‐mg rebamipide SR tablets (Mucotra SR Tablet; Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) twice daily for 2 weeks as part of routine medical care, with the option to extend the treatment up to 4 weeks. In this study, the diagnosis of gastritis was based on clinical symptoms reported by patients, without the use of endoscopic or histological confirmation. Acute gastritis was defined as newly developed gastrointestinal symptoms lasting < 3 months, whereas chronic gastritis was defined as symptoms persisting for 3 months or longer.

Electronic PROs were used before and after rebamipide SR treatment to assess patients' subjective gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. PROs data were collected at two consecutive clinic visits: before treatment initiation (baseline) and at the follow‐up visit, which occurred 2–4 weeks of treatment. During each visit, patients received a survey link via text message and completed the self‐administered questionnaire on their personal mobile devices while at the clinic. As this was an online, self‐reported survey, responses reflected the patients' subjective symptom experiences. Self‐reported GI symptoms included epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea/vomiting, reflux, abdominal distention, anorexia, heartburn, and belching. The severity of each GI symptom was rated on a scale from 0 to 3, as follows: 0 for absence, 1 for no interference, 2 for minimum interference, and 3 for marked interference with normal daily activities or sleep. The frequency of GI symptoms was also rated from 0 to 3, as follows: 0 for absence, 1 for once a week, 2 for two or three times a week, and 3 for more than three times a week. Symptom scores were calculated as the sum of the severity and frequency scores, with a maximum score of 48. Improvement in GI symptoms was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from the initial GI symptom scores [17].

Information on concomitant gastrointestinal medications, such as PPIs, H2blockers, and propulsives, was collected from the prescription data to evaluate their effects. This included the specific type, dose, regimen, and duration of the prescribed medication. While a variety of agents were available—including esomeprazole, rabeprazole, dexlansoprazole, omeprazole, tegoprazan, fexuprazan—the prescribed regimen was found to be remarkably homogenous. Specifically, over 90% of patients in the combination therapy group were prescribed esomeprazole 20 mg once daily. Data on height, weight, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, smoking, caffeine intake, pregnancy status, andH. pyloriinfection status were also collected as part of routine clinical care.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study received approval from the Public Institutional Review Board designated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (P01‐202203‐01‐022, P01‐202204‐01‐021, P01‐202205‐01‐021, P01‐202206‐01‐026). All patients provided written informed consent.

This study performed a post hoc analysis on data from the prospective observational study described above. The analysis was driven by the specific hypothesis that combination therapy with rebamipide and PPIs would be superior to rebamipide monotherapy in improving gastritis symptoms. To test this hypothesis, patients who received 150‐mg rebamipide SR tablets twice daily for 2 weeks as part of routine medical care—with the option to extend the treatment up to 4 weeks—and who had both baseline and follow‐up PROs on subjective GI symptoms were included. These patients were then categorized into two treatment groups: a rebamipide monotherapy group and a combination therapy group of rebamipide with PPIs. To enhance internal validity, patients who administered other GI medications, such as H2 blockers or prokinetics, were excluded. This approach was designed to isolate the effect of PPIs on the effectiveness of rebamipide SR and to minimize potential confounding.

Descriptive statistics for patient‐reported symptom scores were presented by treatment group and classified into severity, frequency, and total score. The data in this study were collected at two time points—before and after treatment—for each subject, forming a pre‐post structure without repeated longitudinal observations. Therefore, changes in symptom scores from baseline to posttreatment were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the baseline score as a covariate. Model diagnostics for ANCOVA assumptions were performed by residual diagnostics, including residual‐versus‐fitted plots for linearity,Q–Qplots, and the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality in FigureS2and TableS1. These evaluations confirmed that key model assumptions were reasonably met. Furthermore, GI symptom improvement (defined as ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) was treated as a categorical variable and analyzed using chi‐square tests.

Missing data, including those in PRO variables, were addressed using multiple imputation. Multiple imputation was performed using the MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) method in R to generate 20 imputed datasets (m= 20), with all variables included in the final analyses used in the imputation model. Regression analyses were conducted separately in each imputed dataset; results were pooled using Rubin's Rule to account for imputation uncertainty.

To control for potential confounding between treatment groups, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied [18]. Propensity scores were estimated separately in each of the 20 imputed datasets using logistic regression models, including covariates such as age, sex, height, weight, alcohol consumption, smoking status, caffeine intake, type of gastritis, and healthcare institution type. IPTW weights were calculated based on the estimated propensity scores in each dataset and applied accordingly.

To evaluate covariate balance after weighting, weighted group‐wise comparisons were performed using linear and logistic regression models for each covariate in each imputed dataset. Since pooling standardized mean differences (SMDs) across multiply imputed datasets is methodologically complex, we instead pooledpvalues obtained from regression analyses using Rubin's Rule, which is a common alternative in real‐world data analysis. Additionally, for visualization, a Love plot based on the first imputed dataset was constructed to display the distribution of SMDs before and after IPTW.

All analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The “mice,” “twang,” “survey,” and “cobalt” packages were used for multiple imputation, propensity score modeling, weighting, and diagnostic evaluation.

The study enrolled 2814 patients who presented with acute or chronic gastritis symptoms suggestive of gastritis, as shown in Figure1. A total of 2209 patients were included in the analysis, with 1946 patients in the rebamipide monotherapy group and 263 patients in the combination therapy group receiving both rebamipide and PPIs. Table1presents the baseline characteristics before and after applying IPTW. The rebamipide monotherapy group had 937 males (48.2%) and 1009 females (51.8%), while the combination therapy group had 120 males (45.6%) and 143 females (54.4%). The mean age of patients in the rebamipide monotherapy group was 49.9 years, while the mean age in the combination therapy group was 51.3 years. The IPTW adjustment improved covariate balance across treatment groups, as reflected by increasedpvalues for most covariates. The adjusted weighted sample sizes were 1946.0 in the rebamipide monotherapy group and 1430.8 in the combination therapy group, ensuring balanced comparisons across key covariates.

Acute gastritis was predominant in both groups, affecting 76.8% of the monotherapy group and 66.5% of the combination therapy group before IPTW adjustment, with an improved balance (SMD = 0.039) after IPTW. Patients were treated across various healthcare settings, with 62.7% receiving care in general hospitals and 37.3% in local clinics in the monotherapy group, compared to 66.2% and 33.8% in the combination therapy group. After IPTW, the distribution across hospital types showed a nearly identical balance between groups (SMD = 0.001), supporting comparable baseline characteristics across treatment settings.

Figure2and Table2summarize the changes in patient‐reported subjective GI symptom scores—Severity, Frequency, and Total Scores—between treatment groups, both before and after IPTW. At baseline, the Total GI Symptom Score was 19.40 for the monotherapy group and 19.78 for the combination therapy group, with no significant difference between groups (p= 0.604). Following treatment, both groups demonstrated a marked reduction in symptoms. Posttreatment scores for Severity, Frequency, and Total Symptoms in both groups showed no significant differences either before (pvalues: 0.592, 0.798, and 0.885, respectively) or after IPTW adjustment (pvalues: 0.313, 0.312, and 0.653, respectively).

Least‐square (LS) means were calculated using an ANCOVA model to assess differences in subjective GI symptom scores between the rebamipide monotherapy and combination therapy groups, both pre‐ and posttreatment. The LS means difference in total scores was −0.04 (p= 0.920) before IPTW and −0.24 (p= 0.653) after IPTW, showing no statistically significant differences in treatment effect between groups. Severity and frequency scores also showed no significant differences, with LS means differences of 0.09 (p= 0.687) and −0.13 (p= 0.551) before IPTW, and −0.23 (p= 0.398) and −0.01 (p= 0.962) after IPTW, respectively.

Table3summarizes the ≥ 50% improvement rates in patient‐reported subjective GI symptom scores between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups, both before and after IPTW. Before IPTW adjustment, the improvement rates for severity, frequency, and total scores were 71.7%, 67.8%, and 71.6% for the monotherapy group and 69.6%, 69.2%, and 71.9% for the combination therapy group, respectively, with no statistically significant differences between groups (pvalues: 0.478, 0.655, and 0.938). After IPTW, the rates for severity, frequency, and total scores were 71.7%, 67.6%, and 71.6% in the monotherapy group and 67.9%, 67.6%, and 69.3% in the combination therapy group, with no significant differences observed (pvalues: 0.252, 0.837, and 0.506). Overall, these findings indicate no statistically significant differences in > 50% improvement rates for severity, frequency, or total symptom scores between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups, suggesting that monotherapy may be as effective as combination therapy with PPIs in achieving symptom relief in gastritis patients.

To further investigate potential differences in treatment response, we analyzed the continuous change scores in subjective GI symptom domains, both before and after IPTW adjustment. As shown in Table4, no statistically significant differences were observed between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups in any domain, including severity, frequency, and total scores. These findings were consistent with the binary outcome results.

Covariate balance was evaluated using three complementary approaches. First, covariate balance was assessed usingpvalues obtained from weighted comparisons before and after applying IPTW. As presented in Table1,pvalues increased for most covariates following IPTW, indicating improved balance between the treatment groups. Second, we assessed the distribution of IPTW weights to verify the stability and appropriateness of the weighting process. Both the histogram and density plot demonstrated that the majority of weights were concentrated around 1, with very few exceeding the range of 3–5 (FigureS1). Although some extreme values were present, they were rare and unlikely to meaningfully influence the overall analysis. Third, a Love plot was constructed based on the first imputed dataset to visualize the SMDs before and after IPTW. As shown in Figure3, most covariates showed reduced absolute mean differences after weighting, with nearly all falling below the conventional threshold of 0.1. This further confirms that IPTW effectively improved covariate balance between the treatment groups. Collectively, these findings indicate that the IPTW methodology successfully achieved covariate balance and enhanced comparability between the treatment groups, thereby minimizing potential confounding bias.

This real‐world, multicenter observational study evaluated the effectiveness of rebamipide SR tablets in patients with acute or chronic gastritis, focusing on PROs to assess subjective GI symptom improvement. As a result, there were significant reductions in subjective GI symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, and abdominal distention, with no substantial differences between the rebamipide monotherapy group and the combination therapy group. The improvement rate of GI symptoms in the present study is also similar to the results of previous studies on rebamipide, eupatilin, or fexuprazan use in patients with gastritis [19,20,21,22,23].

While our study found no significant differences between monotherapy and combination therapy with PPIs, other researchers have suggested potential additive benefits when rebamipide is administered in combination with PPIs. For instance, Du et al. [21] reported that combining rebamipide with sucralfate inH. pylori‐positive patients enhanced anti‐inflammatory effects, suggesting that in specific populations, combination therapies might offer additional clinical advantages. This discrepancy found between our study and other research may suggest the need for further stratified analyses based on patient profiles, particularly in patient populations withH. pyloriinfection or chronic nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.

Several factors may account for the observed differences between our findings and those of previous studies. Variability in patient characteristics—such as age, comorbidities, NSAID use, andH. pyloriinfection status—could affect treatment responses. Differences in study design, including sample size, treatment duration, and follow‐up periods, could also contribute to these discrepancies. Notably, prior studies often relied on endoscopic or histological findings as primary endpoints, whereas our study evaluated symptom relief using PROs, which reflect patient‐centered outcomes in real‐world clinical settings. Furthermore, regional variations in healthcare systems, medication formulations (e.g., sustained‐release vs. immediate‐release), patient adherence behaviors, and genetic factors such as CYP2C19 genotype distribution—known to influence PPI efficacy—may have impacted treatment effectiveness. Although IPTW adjustment likely reduced potential imbalances, the absence of genotype data remains a limitation, emphasizing the need to interpret real‐world evidence within its specific clinical and methodological framework.

The utilization of PROs in this study highlights the importance of patient‐centered outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for gastritis symptoms [24,25,26]. Given that gastritis symptoms treatments are administered to alleviate subjective symptoms, direct patient feedback on the severity and frequency of symptoms provides valuable insights into the real‐world effectiveness of drugs like rebamipide SR. This approach is consistent with current FDA guidelines, which emphasize the role of PROs in evaluating the effectiveness of symptomatic treatments [16].

One of the strengths of this study is that patients were primarily recruited from local clinics rather than larger, research‐focused hospitals. This means that the findings of our study are more generalizable because the real‐world population typically encountered in everyday clinical practice can be represented more accurately. Local clinics serve a wide range of patient populations and can reflect the actual treatment environment for most gastritis patients. This broader recruitment allows our results to be more readily applicable to community‐based care, which is essential for understanding the effectiveness of rebamipide SR in diverse populations under routine medical care. Although diagnostic and treatment procedures such as endoscopic evaluations could be more helpful in collecting and assessing more information about gastric healing, this study prioritized symptom relief as the primary endpoint to maintain feasibility and real‐world applicability. Future studies could consider including other evaluation methods to corroborate patient‐reported symptom improvements.

Previous studies have demonstrated rebamipide's effectiveness in promoting gastric mucosal healing and reducing inflammation by inhibiting ROS and inflammatory cytokines [27]. Our study's findings also show significant symptom relief over a short‐term treatment period. Unlike controlled trials, which often exclude patients with comorbidities or concomitant medications, our observational study design reflects routine clinical practice and shows the generalizability of the results.

Rebamipide is frequently administered as an alternative to, or in combination with, PPIs, especially in patients who need mucosal protection without acid suppression. In addition to its clinical utility, rebamipide is a safer and more tolerable treatment option compared to long‐term PPI use, due to its favorable safety profile for chronic administration and reduced dosing frequency if used as an SR formulation. This study contributes valuable evidence regarding rebamipide's role in gastritis symptom relief, which can be a suitable treatment for patients who cannot tolerate PPIs; also, rebamipide could be an option for those who prefer a cost‐effective treatment. The widespread clinical use of rebamipide in South Korea and other East Asian countries also supports our decision to choose it as the mucosal protectant in this study. In these regions, rebamipide is commonly preferred over sucralfate, either as monotherapy or combined with PPIs, due to its better tolerability, greater patient convenience (twice daily dosing compared to the multiple daily doses required for sucralfate), and wider availability. By contrast, sucralfate is more frequently prescribed in Western countries, such as the United States, but requires multiple daily administrations on an empty stomach and may interfere with the absorption of other medications, potentially affecting adherence. Although direct comparative studies between rebamipide and sucralfate remain limited, existing evidence suggests that rebamipide offers similar mucosal protective efficacy, along with improved patient adherence and fewer drug interactions.

While some studies have suggested that combining rebamipide with PPIs may have a synergistic effect on mucosal healing, our findings did not show significant differences in symptom improvement between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups. This suggests that rebamipide SR alone may be sufficient to achieve substantial symptom relief, which is particularly relevant for patients who want to minimize the amount and duration of medication administration [28].

This study has several limitations that must be considered. Firstly, our study was designed as an observational study and not a randomized clinical trial, which could introduce selection bias despite the use of IPTW to adjust for confounding variables [29]. Nevertheless, the possibility of residual confounding from unmeasured factors (such as specific genetic predispositions) cannot be excluded. Secondly, the diagnosis of gastritis was based on patient‐reported clinical symptoms rather than on objective diagnostic criteria such as endoscopic or histological findings. While this approach reflects the realities of routine clinical practice—where endoscopy is not routinely performed for the diagnosis of gastritis—it may lead to potential misclassification bias. Without objective confirmation, accurately assessing the severity and chronicity of gastric inflammation is challenging, potentially leading to underestimation or overestimation of the treatment effect of rebamipide SR tablets. Thirdly, although our sample size was relatively large and diverse, the follow‐up period was short, limiting the assessment of the long‐term effects of rebamipide SR on chronic gastritis symptoms. Fourthly, adverse events (AEs) were not systematically collected, limiting our safety evaluations. Fifthly, it was not feasible to analyze the impact of concomitant medications on treatment outcomes. Although we collected data on all drugs prescribed, the variety of these medications was vast. The sample size was therefore insufficient to conduct meaningful subgroup analyses for each type of drug. Sixthly, patient adherence to the prescribed regimen was not systematically tracked with high‐precision methods. While prescription histories were monitored during patient visits, this approach provides only a limited assessment of adherence. Future studies should consider more robust methods, such as electronic monitoring systems or patient diaries, to obtain more accurate adherence data and evaluate its impact on long‐term outcomes. Finally, the reliance on PROs was valuable for assessing symptom relief, but PROs are inherently subjective and may not fully reflect the histological improvements [30].

Further research is warranted to investigate the long‐term effects of rebamipide SR, particularly in populations with chronic gastritis. Randomized controlled trials comparing rebamipide SR monotherapy with combination therapy of rebamipide and PPIs could provide more evidence of any potential synergistic effects. Additionally, studies exploring objective biomarkers, such as histological changes in gastric mucosa, would add valuable depth to our understanding of rebamipide SR's therapeutic impact.

Our study also emphasizes the critical role of RWD and PROs in evaluating treatment effectiveness. RWD and PROs offer comprehensive insights into patient‐centered outcomes in routine clinical practices. Such approaches are crucial in understanding the full therapeutic impact of treatments for diseases with specific symptoms like gastritis. The inclusion of a broad network of local clinics further enhances the external validity of our findings, reflecting treatment outcomes for gastritis symptoms across diverse healthcare settings in Korea and affirming the relevance of RWD and PROs for evidence‐based clinical practice.

This study utilized real‐world data collected from local clinical institutions in South Korea. While this enhances internal consistency and relevance to domestic clinical practice, it may limit the generalizability of the findings to other healthcare systems or populations. Differences in clinical guidelines, prescribing behaviors, and patient demographics across countries may influence the effectiveness of the treatment. Future studies involving more diverse international populations are needed to confirm the external validity of our results.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that rebamipide SR tablets effectively reduce GI symptoms in patients presenting with gastritis symptoms, with no additional benefit in symptom relief when administered in combination with PPIs. The twice‐daily dosing regimen and favorable safety profile make rebamipide SR a reasonable option for the routine clinical management of patients with gastritis symptoms. Furthermore, PROs can be used in various research to evaluate the effectiveness of gastritis treatments in real‐world settings.
