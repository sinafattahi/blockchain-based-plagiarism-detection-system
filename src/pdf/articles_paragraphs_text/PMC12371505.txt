In this study, morpholinoethoxy-attached cationic tetra-substituted
phthalocyanines (Pcs), including metal-free (HQH2Pc), zinc (HQZnPc),
and indium (HQInPc) derivatives, were synthesized following
established protocols. Their structures were confirmed by using standard
spectroscopic techniques. The photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy
of these compounds was evaluated against head, neck, and colon cancer
cell lines. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by PDT with
cationic Pcs were quantified by using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate.
To elucidate the mechanisms of action, ROS generation was assessed
at two distinct time points: 30 min (immediate response) and 24 h
(delayed response) post-PDT. The cellular death mechanisms induced
by Pc-mediated PDT in cancer cell lines were investigated using fluorescence
staining with Apopxin Green, CytoCalcein Violet 450, and 7-AAD to
differentiate apoptotic and necrotic pathways and provide insights
into the mode of cell death. The results indicated that the Pcs exhibited
minimal cytotoxicity in the absence of light, confirming their safety
as photosensitizers. Cationic Pcs, particularlyHQZnPc, showed high PDT-induced cytotoxicity and ROS production, primarily
inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines, with FaDu cells exhibiting
the highest sensitivity. These results highlightHQZnPc’s strong potential for cancer therapy and underscore the
need for further research into its delivery and mechanisms in complex
tumor models.

PDT relies on
three essential components: a light source, a photosensitizing
agent, and molecular oxygen, which interact to produce cytotoxic reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and singlet oxygen, leading to the targeted destruction
of tumor cells.−The first step of PDT involves the administration
of a photosensitizer, which preferentially accumulates in the tumor
tissues. Upon exposure to light at a specific wavelength, the photosensitizer
is activated and transitions to an excited triplet state, triggering
photochemical reactions primarily with molecular oxygen. Photophysical activation of ground-state oxygen
in PDT occurs via two distinct pathways. The type I pathway involves
the transfer of electrons or protons from the excited photosensitizer
to molecular oxygen, producing ROS that causes localized cellular
damage. Alternatively, the type II pathway involves direct energy
transfer to oxygen, generating singlet oxygen. The short lifespan (10–350 ns) and limited diffusion range
(∼10–55 nm) of singlet oxygen ensure that its cytotoxic
effects are highly localized, minimizing harm to nearby healthy tissues.,PDT induces cell death through various mechanisms, including apoptosis,
necrosis, or a combination of both, depending on factors such as light
dosage, subcellular localization of the photosensitizer, and the type
of cancer cells. Lower light doses in
PDT typically trigger apoptosis, a controlled and programmed form
of cell death, whereas higher doses tend to induce necrosis, likely
due to the suppression of caspase enzymes and other proteins involved
in the apoptotic pathway.,The precision and versatility
of PDT highlights its potential as a minimally invasive and highly
targeted cancer treatment.

According to the current state of the art, the complexation
of
Pcs with different ions can affect the PDT activity. Even open-shell
paramagnetic ions can reduce the activity. Therefore, the photodynamic activities of Pcs with different central
metal ions need to be further investigated. In addition to the metal
ion located in the Pc center, substituents are also important in PDT
activity. Some substituents, especially amino groups, have been reported
to affect the fluorescence and ROS production. Moreover, quaternary
ammonium groups further enhance the interaction of drugs via electrostatic
interaction, which is beneficial for cellular uptake. Inspired by both the investigation of the effect of different
metal ions and the findings obtained from the studies on morpholine
groups in the literature, this paper focuses on morpholinoethoxy group-substituted
cationic Pcs having different central metal ions. In our previous
study, we tested thein vitrophototoxicity and cytotoxicity
behaviors of quaternized Pcs against the cervical cancer cell line
called HeLa in order to evaluate their suitability for cancer treatment
by the PDT method.−The binding properties of cationic Pcs to CT-DNA
were also investigated by fluorescence and UV–vis spectrophotometric
methods. Here, in this study,in vitroPDT activities
of tetra-substituted cationic metal-free (HQH2Pc), zinc (HQZnPc), and indium
Pcs (HQInPc) carrying morpholinoethoxy groups were evaluated
against different cancer cell lines: submaxillary salivary gland epidermoid
carcinoma (A253), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29), and pharyngeal
squamous carcinoma (FaDu). Additionally, PDT-induced ROS generation
and cell death mechanisms activated in response to Pc-mediated PDT
were evaluated.

Tetra-substituted cationic Pcs (HQH2Pc,HQZnPc, andHQInPc) were synthesized in parallel with the previous study. First, neutral Pcs were obtained by cyclotetramerization
of phthalonitrile compound in the presence of metal salt and 8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]­undec-7-ene
(DBU) base (no metal salt was used in the synthesis of metal-free
Pcs). Then, by treating the obtained neutral Pcs with excess methyl
iodide, cationic derivatives (HQH2Pc,HQZnPc, andHQInPc) were
prepared with 60–75% yields (Figure). While neutral Pcs were soluble in many
organic solvents, their cationic derivatives were only soluble in
DMF, DMSO, and water, as expected.

Preparation of tetra-substituted cationic
phthalocyanines.

The structures of the obtained cationic Pcs were
confirmed by spectroscopic
methods. In the FT-IR spectra of cationic Pcs (HQH2Pc,HQZnPc, andHQInPc), aromatic stretching vibrations were observed around
3000 cm–1, while aliphatic stretching vibrations
were detected in the range of 2870–2950 cm–1. In the IR spectrum of metal-free Pcs (HQH2Pc), vibrations belonging to the inner-NH
groups were additionally detected at 3289 cm–1.

In the1H NMR spectra of cationic Pcs taken in DMSO-d6, aromatic protons were observed in the range
9.50–7.80 ppm, and aliphatic protons were in the range of 5.10–3.30
ppm. In addition, protons belonging to methyl groups were detected
around 3.50 ppm. Pcs were characterized by characteristic B and Q
bands in the UV–vis spectrum. In the spectra of cationic Pcs
(HQH2Pc,HQZnPc, andHQInPc) taken in DMF, Q bands were recorded in
the range of 670–700 nm, and B bands were recorded between
340 and 360 nm (Figure).

Low cytotoxicity in the absence of light
is an essential characteristic of an effective photosensitizer in
PDT applications. The colorimetric WST-1 assay was utilized to evaluate
the dark- and PDT-induced cytotoxicity of the morpholinoethoxy-containing
metallo- and (HQInPcandHQZnPc) metal-free
(HQH2Pc) Pcs on
the A253, FaDu, and HT29 cells (Figure). The results indicated that, at concentrations up
to 10 μM, the Pc molecules exhibited no significant cytotoxicity
in the absence of light across all three cell lines, confirming that
these molecules are nontoxic in dark conditions, a fundamental requirement
for effective photosensitizers. PDT using the metallo Pc molecules
(HQInPcandHQZnPc) resulted in substantial
cell death across all cell lines, with cell viability decreased to
below 50%, whereas metal-free Pc (HQH2Pc) did not induce a comparable reduction across
all tested cell lines and concentrations (FigureA,D,G), indicating limited photodynamic efficacy.
In A253 cells, treatment withHQInPcat 10 μM reduced
the viability to 44% (FigureB), whileHQZnPcat 1 μM achieved a reduction
to 49% (FigureC).
In HT29 cells, viability decreased to 36% and 45% following treatment
withHQInPc(10 μM) andHQZnPc(1
μM), respectively (FigureH,I). The most pronounced phototoxic effect was observed
in FaDu cells, withHQInPc(10 μM) andHQZnPc(0.1 μM) reducing viability to 20% and 46%, respectively (FigureE,F). Notably, HQZnPc
demonstrated a greater cytotoxicity thanHQInPcat lower
concentrations, suggesting superior photodynamic efficiency. These
results demonstrate the promise ofHQZnPcas a more effective
photosensitizer, particularly in PDT-responsive cell lines, such as
FaDu.

Dark- and PDT-induced cytotoxicity of Pcs. PDT with the Pcs molecules,
(A,D,G)HQH2Pc,
(B,E,H)HQInPc, and (C,F,I)HQZnPc, induced
a dose-dependent cytotoxicity with varying degrees, without affecting
cell viability in the absence of light in (A–C) A253, (D–F)
FaDu, and (G–I) HT29 cells.HQH2Pc-PDT ledto
moderate cytotoxicity only at high concentrations; in contrast,HQZnPccaused significant phototoxicity even at lower concentration,
in all the studied cell lines. Results are shown as means ± SD
of three independent experiments. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, and ***p< 0.001.

In order to assess the specificity and safety profile
of the photosensitizers,
the noncancerous fibroblast cell line L929 was utilized as a negative
control. Importantly, L929 cells exhibited no detectable cytotoxicity
under either dark conditions or following photodynamic treatment with
any of the Pc derivatives across all tested concentrations. The absence
of phototoxic effects in the noncancerous L929 cell line reinforces
the selective nature of the photosensitizing compounds toward cancerous
cells, underscoring their potential for targeted PDT with minimal
off-target effects.

Axially or core-substituted closed-shell
Pcs, especially AlPc,
SiPc, and ZnPc derivatives, are known to be suitable for applications
in cancer PDT. The main advantages of
closed-shell transition metal Pcs for PDT applications lie in their
easily tunable optical properties and triplet state formation. These
are responsible for the effective singlet oxygen production required
for the photodynamic effect. Especially recently, interesting studies
have been conducted on the biological and anticancer applications
of polycationic zinc Pcs (ZnPcs). This
is because cationic groups provide electrostatic interactions with
the negatively charged cell membrane and enhance phototoxicity through
better interaction with cellular components. In our study, consistent
with the literature,HQZnPcdisplayed better cell death
thanHQH2PcandHQInPcin all cells studied at both low and high doses due
to the closed-shell effect.

The generation
of ROS upon activation of the photosensitizer by light triggers irreversible
oxidation of critical cellular components, leading to tissue damage
and constituting the primary mechanism of PDT. Molecular oxygen is
essential in this process as ROS-mediated cellular damage primarily
arises from energy transfer between excited Pc molecules and nearby
oxygen molecules.

PDT-induced ROS levels were measured using
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) at two distinct time
points: 30 min (immediate) and 24 h (delayed) post-PDT.HQH2Pc-mediated PDT produced minimal
ROS in FaDu (FigureD) and HT29 (FigureG) cells, with no significant changes in A253 cells (FigureA) compared to the untreated
control. In contrast, the metallo-PcsHQInPc(FigureB,E,H) andHQZnPc(FigureC,F,I) generated significantly higher ROS levels across all cell
lines, with HQZnPc inducing the most substantial ROS production, particularly
in FaDu cells (FigureF). Additionally, ROS production exhibited a clear dose- and time-dependent
increase, peaking at 24 h post-PDT. Zn-centered Pc consistently generated
the highest ROS levels across all cell lines, highlighting the enhanced
efficacy ofHQZnPc. The strong correlation between ROS
levels and cytotoxicity confirms that PDT-induced cell damage is primarily
driven by ROS generation. The higher delayed ROS levels compared with
immediate levels indicate prolonged ROS activity, leading to sustained
oxidative stress within the cells. These findings underscore the significant
effect of the central metal ion in Pc molecules on ROS formation and
its critical contribution to the effectiveness of PDT. In the case
of metallo-Pcs, it is clear thatHQZnPc has the highest
level due to the closed-shell effect. When the studies conductedin
the literature, especially on metal-free and ZnPcswere examined,
it was reported that ZnPcs gave more positive results, as expected.,The results obtained from this study are consistent with those of
studies in the literature.

PDT-induced ROS production mediated by the Pcs
molecules, (A,D,G)HQH2Pc, (B,E,H)HQInPc, and (C,F,I)HQZnPc, in (A–C) A253,
(D–F) FaDu, and (G–I) HT29 cells. Results are means
± SD of three independent experiments. *p<
0.05, **p< 0.01, and ***p<
0.001. PDT light dose: 20 J cm–2.

The cellular death mechanisms induced by Pc-mediated PDT in cancer
cell lines were examined by using fluorescence staining with Apopxin
Green, CytoCalcein Violet 450, and 7-AAD. PDT-induced ROS production
drives cellular damage, resulting in apoptosis, necrosis, or both.
A hallmark of early apoptosis is the externalization of phosphatidylserine
(PS) from the inner to outer plasma membrane leaflet. Apopxin Green
binds to these exposed negatively charged PS residues, identifying
apoptotic cells (green), while CytoCalcein Violet 450 marks viable
cells (blue), and 7-AAD stains necrotic cells (red). The results indicated
that PDT with the metal-free Pc (HQH2Pc) exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, inducing only
a small fraction of apoptotic cells, consistent with its limited therapeutic
potential (Figure). In contrast, PDT with metallo-Pcs (HQInPcandHQZnPc) induced significant cell death across all tested cancer
cell lines, predominantly through apoptotic pathways. In A253 (Figure) and HT29 cells
(Figure), apoptosis was the primary mode of cell death, with necrosis
occurring at lower but notable levels. Similarly, the majority of
FaDu cells (Figure) exhibited apoptotic cell death, with necrosis observed in a negligible
fraction.

Many factors, such as the degree of binding of
Pc, their substituent
groups, the nature of the central metal atom, and their aggregation
state, significantly influence their absorption within the optical
transmission window of biological tissues.,Analysis of the cellular death mechanisms revealed that the nature
of the central metal in Pcs with identical substituent groups plays
a pivotal role in their effectiveness. Consistent with the literature,
ZnPcs, despite varying substituents, consistently demonstrated superior
results, attributable to the electronic configuration of the zinc­(II)
ion.,−Compared to clinically
established photosensitizers such as Photofrin, Verteporfin, and Temoporfin,
which have been extensively studied for their PDT efficacy, the cationic
Pc derivatives developed in this study exhibit promisingin
vitroprofiles. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a highly
tumor-specific photosensitizer precursor for PDT. IC50values
of 5-ALA have been reported in the range of 35–70 μM.,Due to its hydrophilic nature, ALA exhibits limited cellular and
tissue penetration, reducing its efficacy in treating deep or poorly
vascularized tumors. Photofrin, a first-generation
FDA-approved photosensitizer, typically demonstrates IC50values ranging from 0.3 to 8 μM in various cancer cell lines.,While effective and requiring relatively lower concentrations compared
to 5-ALA to induce cytotoxicity, it is associated with limitations
such as prolonged cutaneous photosensitivity due to its extended retention
in tissues. Verteporfin and Temoporfin,
second-generation photosensitizers, demonstrate higher PDT potency,
often achieving IC50values in the range of 0.5–2
μM in various cancer cell lines,,but their
clinical applications are hindered by poor aqueous solubility, rapid
photobleaching, and limited selectivity.,In contrast, HQZnPc displayed potent phototoxicity at a 1 μM
concentration, resulting in over 90% cell death in FaDu cells, accompanied
by elevated ROS levels and apoptosis. The morpholinoethoxy substituents
and quaternized cationic nature of HQZnPc are likely to contribute
to enhanced water solubility and cellular uptake, thus improving the
pharmacodynamic properties relative to traditional agents. These findings
underscore HQZnPc’s strong potential as a next-generation photosensitizer
for PDT. To advance its clinical application, future studies should
focus on improving the tumor selectivity and pharmacokinetics ofHQZnPc.In addition to apoptosis and ROS-related mechanisms,
alterations in cell cycle progression are also critical indicators
of cellular responses to PDT. Although cell cycle analysis was not
included in the current study, it represents a valuable approach for
understanding whether photosensitizer-induced stress leads to specific
cell cycle arrest or disruption. Given that many photosensitizers
exert their cytotoxic effects by interfering with DNA replication
or mitotic machinery, determining the
precise phase at which these Pc derivatives exert their action may
provide deeper mechanistic insight. Therefore, comprehensive cell
cycle profiling will be an important component of future investigations,
enabling a more complete characterization of the therapeutic effects
and molecular mechanisms of these compounds. Investigating its subcellular
localization will be pivotal for understanding its mechanism of action
and achieving precise cancer cell targeting. The intracellular localization
of photosensitizers is a critical determinant of PDT efficacy given
the highly localized nature of ROS-mediated damage. Since ROS exhibit
limited diffusion, their biological effects are strongly influenced
by the subcellular compartments where photosensitizers accumulate.
Several studies have reported that Zn­(II)-Pcs preferentially localize
to mitochondria and lysosomes, organelles that play central roles
in apoptotic signaling and cellular stress responses.−This organelle-specific targeting has been associated with enhanced
PDT-induced apoptosis and is thought to underlie the superior efficacy
of Zn­(II)-Pcs relative to that of their metal-free counterparts. The
amphiphilic and cationic structural modifications of HQZnPc suggest
a high likelihood of mitochondrial and lysosomal targeting, as reported
for similar compounds. Future work aiming to experimentally validate
these hypotheses through colocalization studies using organelle-specific
fluorescent markers may enable a more comprehensive understanding
of the intracellular behavior of HQZnPc and its impact on PDT outcomes.
Furthermore, the rational design of Pc derivatives with optimized
substituent groups could enhance their tumor specificity and overall
photodynamic efficiency. Although the present study demonstrates the
promising potential of morpholinoethoxy-substituted cationic Pcs,
particularly HQZnPc, in 2Din vitrocancer models,
further investigations are warranted to enhance clinical translation.
Future studies should focus on evaluating these compounds in three-dimensional
(3D) tumor spheroid models, which better mimic the tumor microenvironment,
including gradients of oxygen, nutrients, and cellular heterogeneity.
Moreover,in vivostudies in suitable animal models
are crucial to assess the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, tumor
selectivity, and systemic toxicity of HQZnPc. These advanced models
will provide deeper insights into the therapeutic window, optimize
light delivery strategies, and validate the long-term antitumor efficacy
and safety profile required for potential clinical applications.

The PDT-induced cytotoxicity,
ROS generation, and cell death mechanisms
of cationic tetra-substituted metal-free (HQH2Pc) and metallo-Pcs (HQInPcandHQZnPc), synthesized and characterized in accordance
with the literature, were comprehensively studied. Neither the metal-free
(HQH2Pc) nor the
metallo-Pcs (HQInPcandHQZnPc) exhibited
cytotoxicity in the absence of light across the studied cell lines,
confirming their nontoxic nature under dark conditions. Upon light
activation, these Pcs demonstrated significant cytotoxicity, particularly
in FaDu cells, underscoring their effectiveness as photosensitizers.
Metallo-Pc-mediated PDT induced substantial ROS production in a dose-
and time-dependent manner across all cell lines, strongly correlating
with the cytotoxicity results, emphasizing the pivotal role of ROS
in PDT. Furthermore, this study revealed that PDT with metallo-Pcs
predominantly induced apoptosis as the primary cell death mechanism.
The results from PDT-induced cytotoxicity and ROS generation demonstrate
the promising potential of metallo-Pcs, particularlyHQZnPc, for cancer therapy. To enhance the clinical applicability of Pcs,
further studies should focus on optimizing ZnPc formulations, investigating
subcellular localization, and exploring their mechanisms of action
in more complex and clinically relevant tumor models.

A253 and HT29 cells
were cultured in McCoy’s 5A modified medium, supplemented with
FBS (10%, v/v) and penicillin streptomycin (1%, v/v). FaDu cells were
cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle with Joklik modification
supplemented with FBS (10%, v/v) and penicillin–streptomycin
(1%, v/v).

Dark cytotoxicity
assessments were carried out using a wide concentration range of Pc
molecules (0.1–100 μM). Based on these results, the concentrations
that showed no cytotoxic effects under dark conditions in the tested
cell lines were selected for PDT assays. Therefore, the PDT efficacy
was specifically evaluated at two representative concentrations within
this nontoxic range to isolate light-induced effects. Following the administration of Pc molecules at two concentrations
(1–10 μM), the cells were incubated in a humidified incubator
(37 °C and 5% CO2) for 1 h to facilitate the cellular
uptake of the Pc molecules. PDT application was conducted using ceLED
(CETONI, Germany) equipment with a light dose of 20 J cm–2at the appropriate wavelength (650–670 nm).

The cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (5 × 103cells/well), and cultured for 24 h in a humidified incubator (37
°C, 5% CO2). After incubation, varying concentrations
of Pc molecules were administered to the cells and shielded from light.
PDT group was subsequently exposed to 20 J cm–2of
radiation at 650–670 nm, then incubated in a humidified incubator
(37 °C, 5% CO2). Following 24 h of treatment, cell
viability was determined using the WST-1 assay.

PDT-induced ROS production in the cells was determined using 2′,
7′-DCFDA. The cells were seeded
onto the wells of a 96-well plate (104cells/well) and
incubated for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). After, Pc molecules
(1–10 μM) were administrated to the cells, PDT (20 J
cm–2, 650–670 nm) was applied, and the cells
were incubated for 30 min (immediate ROS production) and 24 h (delayed
ROS production) in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Following the incubation, the cells were treated with DCFDA (20
μM in HBSS), incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. ROS levels
were measured quantitatively by recording the fluorescence emission
at 529 nm (λ_ex = 504 nm) using a Cytation 5 microplate reader
(Agilent, United States).

PDT-induced
cellular death mechanisms were determined using the Apoptosis/Necrosis
Detection Kit (Abcam,Ab176749) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cells were seeded onto the wells of a 96-well plate
(104cells/well) and incubated for 24 h (37 °C, 5%
CO2). Afterward, Pc molecules (1–10 μM) were
administered to the cells, PDT (20 J cm–2, 650–670
nm) was applied, and incubated for 24 h in a humidified incubator
(37 °C, 5% CO2). Then, the cells were stained with
CytoCalcein Violet 450, Apopxin Green, and 7-ADD, and incubated for
60 min, and images were taken using Cytation 5 (Agilent, United States).
The quantitative analysis was carried out by counting the number of
apoptotic and necrotic cells from the captured images using Gen5 software
(Agilent, United States).
