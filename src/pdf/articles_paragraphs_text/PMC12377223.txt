This study aimed to design and synthesize a prostate-specific membrane antigen inhibitor (PSMA-P1) and to formulate a freeze-dried kit for radiolabeling with Technetium-99m (99mTc) to improve prostate cancer detection. A molecular docking study was carried out to calculate affinity parameters against four targeted protein structures (PDB IDs: 2ZCH, 2XW1, 2OOT, and 2XV7) to provide a comprehensive understanding of ligand–receptor interactions, along with structural features of synthesized PSMA to explain their QSAR. PSMA-P1 was efficiently synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), which served as the basis for its chemical synthesis. The freeze-dried kit of PSMA-P1 was formulated for the easy preparation of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 with high radiochemical purity (≥99%). [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 showed strong binding affinity (Ki= 69.14 μM) with PDB ID: 2OOT. The [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 demonstrated high stability (≥95% up to 4 h)in vitroin serum, hydrophilicity (logD7.4= −2.55 ± 0.130), and strong PSMA binding affinity (Kd= 16.14 ± 1.452 nM). The accumulation of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (1.68 ± 0.16% ID g−1) was prominently observed at 4 h post-injection in the 22Rv1 tumor model. The co-injection of 2-PMPA significantly inhibited the uptake of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 to PSMA-expressing tumors and tissues, indicating that PSMA selectively mediates these uptakes. The SPECT/CT results are consistent with thein vivobiodistribution. The first single-patient study further revealed that [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 is an efficient imaging agent for PSMA-expressing tumors. This will be a promising candidate for prostate cancer.

This study aimed to design and synthesize a prostate-specific membrane antigen inhibitor (PSMA-P1) and to formulate a freeze-dried kit for radiolabeling with Technetium-99m (99mTc) to improve prostate cancer detection.

Technetium-99m (99mTc) is widely used in diagnostic imaging because of its favorable physical characteristics (γ= 141 keV with 89% abundance), easy availability (99Mo/99mTc generators), limited radiation toxicity, excellent coordination chemistry, making it highly suitable for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging.13,14Furthermore, its half-life (T1/2= 6 h) is adequate for99mTc radiopharmaceutical preparation in hospitals pharmacy allowing ample time for quality control, administration to patients, and image acquisition.15,16Several urea-based small [99mTc]Tc-PSMA tracers including [99mTc]Tc-MAS3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE),17, [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1417,18, [99mTc]Tc-PSMA I&S,19, [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1405,20[99mTc]Tc-MIP-1340 (ref.21) [99mTc][Tc]-PSMAT4 (ref.22) have been clinically evaluated for SPECT/CT imaging of PCa.

[99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-ALUG has emerged as a valuable imaging agent and demonstrated successful utility in the initial staging of 227 PCa patients.23This development also led to creating a freeze-dried kit for [99mTc]Tc HYNIC-ALUG,24simplifying preparation and clinical implementation. However, its pharmacokinetic profile presents certain challenges. Studies have reported high renal uptake and prolonged retention, which may interfere with image interpretation and increase radiation exposure to non-target organs. Furthermore, notable accumulation in the intestines and gallbladder suggests hepatobiliary involvement in excretion, leading to non-ideal clearance patterns. These challenges highlight the need for structural modifications to optimize pharmacokinetics while maintaining high PSMA binding affinity.25In this present study, we focus on thein silicoevaluation and solid phase synthesis of PSMA-P1, incorporating phenyl (Phe) as the linker moiety, and HYNIC as the ligand. This modification was introduced to optimize receptor binding by engaging the hydrophobic pocket within the PSMA S1 site, potentially enhancing affinity and specificity. Additionally, the new molecular structure was designed to reduce renal retention and minimize hepatobiliary excretion, thereby improving imaging performance. Moreover, the lyophilized kit formulation was developed to facilitate the efficient preparation of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 at the hospital pharmacy. The targeting potential of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-P1 for imaging prostate cancer was evaluated in an animal model. The first patient study further provides the effectiveness of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 in the clinical setting.

The solid phase synthesis of PSMA-P1 is shown in Scheme S1. Initially, 2-CTC resin (1.55 mmol, 1 g) was soaked for 30 min in dry DCM (3 mL) followed by the addition of Fmo-Lys (Alloc)-OH (2.8 g, 6.2 mmol), and DIPEA (6 mL, 37 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred gently for 18 h to produce lysine-immobilized resin 3. After the completion of the reaction resin was washed with DCM (3 × 20 mL) and unreacted CTC groups were blocked by reacting it with a mixture of methanol and DIPEA (1 : 1) for 30 min. Fmoc was removed by treating with 10 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF. A solution of bis(t-Bu)-l-glutamate hydrochloride (1.8 g, 6.2 mmol) and DIPEA (4 mL, 24 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (90 mL) was mixed to triphosgene (0.6 g, 2.3 mmol) in DCM (30 mL) over a period for 4 h at 0 °C and stirred for 30 min to obtain 5. Subsequently, lysine immobilized resin (3) (1 g, 1.55 mmol) was added at once and the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hours at room temperature. After the completion of reaction resin was washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL) and DCM (3 × 10 mL) to get 6. The alloc protecting group was removed by reacting the resin with TTPP (0.5 g, 0.46 mmol) in the presence of morpholine (13.8 mmol, 6.6 mL) in DCM for 3 h in darkness. Washing of the resin was carried out with (5 × 3 mL) sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (0.5% solution in DMF) and subsequently with DCM (5 mL × 3) to produce 7.

Fmoc-Phe-OH (2.3 g, 6.2 mmol) was added to 7 which was activated by HOBT (0.4 g, 3.1 mmol) and HBTU (0.99 g, 3.1 mmol) in DMF with the presence of DIPEA (6 mL, 37 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight (20 h) and washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL) and DCM (3 × 10 mL) respectively to yield 8. Fmoc deprotection was performed using 20% piperidine in DMF, yielding compound 9. Fmoc-6-Ahx-OH (2.1 g, 6.2 mmol) was dissolved in DMF, and DIPEA (6 mL, 37 mmol), HOBT (0.4 g, 3.1 mmol), and HBTU (0.99 g, 3.1 mmol) were added. After stirring for 30 min compound 9 was added and reacted overnight to produce 10. The Fmoc group was removed to yield compound 11. The conjugation of HYNIC-BOC to compound 12 was performed by the addition of DIPEA, HOBT (0.4 g, 3.1 mmol), TBTU (0.99 g, 3.1 mmol) and reacted overnight. After the completion of the reaction the resin was cleaved by adding TFA : DCM (1 : 1) and stirred for 3 h then filtered to obtain compound 13 (PSMA-P1) in 42% overall yield. The crude obtained was purified by semi prep RP-HPL and confirmed by LC-MS (Fig. S5) and1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO)δ7.98–7.93 (d,J= 21 Hz, 1H), 7.7–7.69 (d,J= 10 Hz, 1H),7.24–7.21 (t,J= 7 Hz, 3H), 7.18–7.16 (d,J= 8.5 Hz, 3H), 6.86–6.85 (d,J= 7.5 Hz, 1H), 6.33–6.27 (d,d,J= 7 Hz, 1H), 4.02–4.14 (q,J= 17 Hz, 2H), 2.96–2.94 (q,J= 8 Hz, 8H), 2.27–2.04 (q,J= 10 Hz, 2H) (Fig. S6),13C-NMR (125 MHz, DMSO,δ= ppm) 176.74, 175.47, 174.72, 173.60, 167.86, 158.44, 157.32, 150.15, 140.34, 137.68, 129.38, 129.05, 127.15, 123.31, 113.43, 107.48, 86.21, 55.05, 53.82, 52.76, 30.47, 26.90, 24.26, 22.24, 19.83 (Fig. S7).

A series of wet99mTc-labeling of PSMA-P1 was conducted to optimize the quantities and concentrations of reagents, as well as the optimized temperature and labeling time served as the basis for developing the dry kit formulation. In the preformulation study for the kit, EDDA, tricine, andd-mannitol were subjected to optimized freeze-drying conditions for 24 h in a freeze dryer. This involved freezing the vial at −40 °C for 6 hours, followed by primary drying for 12 h and secondary drying at 0 °C for 2 hours and 20 °C for 4 h, after which the product was sealed under vacuum. The final kit formulation contains EDDA (10 mg), tricine (20 mg),d-mannitol (50 mg), stannous chloride dihydrate (50 μg), and PSMA-P1 (20 μg) in PBS buffer at pH 7.

Na[99mTcO4−] (370–555 MBq, 1 mL) was added to the PSMA-P1 kit, and the vial was vortexed for 1 min to ensure mixing. The vial was placed in a boiling water bath at 100 °C for 20 minutes, then allowed to cool to room temperature. The radiochemical purity was assessed using ITLC-SG and radio-HPLC. The radio-HPLC analysis was employed the mobile phase consisting of 0.1% TFA in water (A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (B), with a gradient from 0% to 100% B over 30 minutes at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. Radio-TLC was performed according to the reported method.38The proposed structure of the complex is given inScheme 1.

Thein vitrostability of the [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was evaluated in saline and human serum. [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (37 MBq, 100 μL) was added to saline (500 μL) and human serum (500 μL) separately, and stability was monitored over a period of 4 h. Aliquots of 100 μL were collected at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours and mixed with an equal volume (100 μL) of ethanol and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was analyzed, and quality control was performed as described in Section 2.4.

The cellular uptake assay was carried out in 22Rv1 cells. Approximately 2 × 105cells were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. After incubation, the wells were washed once with HBSS buffer (2 mL) to remove non-adherent cells. The cell was incubated with [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (0.3 μCi per well) for 4 h at 37 °C. Specific uptake was determined by blocking the cells with 100 μM of 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA). Following the incubation, the wells were washed twice with HBSS buffer (3 mL) to remove unbound radiotracer. Finally, the cells in each well were lysed using 0.5 mL of 0.5% SDS solution to analyze the bound radiotracer.

To determine the binding affinity (Kd), a saturation binding assay was carried out of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1. The 22Rv1 cells (1 × 105 cells per well, 1 mL) were plated into a 24-well flat-bottom plate and allowed to form adherent for 24 h before the binding experiment. The medium in each well was then replaced with HBSS supplemented with 1% BSA, containing serial dilution of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 in increasing concentration. Cells were incubated with the [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 at 37 °C for 1 hour. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 3 mL of HBSS to eliminate unbound radioactivity. The cells were then lysated by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate in PBS (0.5%, 500 μL) to each well and gently mixed before transferring to plastic tubes. The radioactivity of each sample was counted by γ-counter (PerkinElmer Wizard2automatic γ-counter), alongside reference samples representing the total amount of radioactivity initially added. Non-specific binding was assessed by co-incubating cells with 250 μM 2-PMPA, while specific binding was obtained by subtracting non-specific from total binding. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined using a one-site binding modelvianon-linear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Seoul National University Hospital. The institution is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC International), and all procedures were conducted by relevant guidelines and regulations.

All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, which is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC International, 2007). Thein vivobiodistribution of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 has been evaluated in male nude mice with 22Rv1 tumors. [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was injected into each mouse using a lateral tail vein. The mice expired at 4 h post-injection. The necessary organs and tissues were removed and preserved. To ensure the specific absorption, mice received a co-injection of 100 μg of 2-PMPA. The mean standard deviation is used to express values (SD).

SPECT/CT imaging was performed 4 hours after intravenous administration of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (11 MBq/200 μL)viathe tail vein in BALB/c male nude mice bearing 22Rv1 tumors. To determine whether tumor uptake was PSMA-dependent, mice were co-injected with 100 μg of the potent inhibitor 2-PMPA. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and imaging was conducted using the NanoSPECT/CT system. The SPECT scanning parameters include γ-ray energy of 140 keV ± 10%, a matrix size of 256 × 256, five projections per angular step of 18°, and data acquisition using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with nine iterations. CT imaging was conducted using a tube voltage of 45 kV and an exposure time of 1.5 seconds per projection, with images reconstructedviacone-beam filtered back-projection. A Gaussian reconstruction filter was applied to the SPECT/CT images, and intensity scaling was adjusted to enhance visualization of the target organs.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of Karachi Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine, Karachi (KIRAN, Karachi) and experiments were approved by ethical committee at KIRAN, Karachi. Informed consent was obtained from human participant of this study. One patient was successfully administered an intravenous injection of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (370 MBq). Whole-body planar imaging was performed, followed by targeted SPECT-CT imaging of the pelvic region 2 hours post-injection. The acquisition parameters for SPECT were set at 10 min, with a peak energy of 140 keV, 10 seconds per projection, a matrix size of 128 × 128, and a zoom factor of 1. For CT, the parameters included an acquisition time of 2–3 minutes, a matrix size of 512 × 512, a DFOV of 50, 120 kV, 160 mA, and a slice thickness of 3.75 mm.

PSMA-P1 interactions and docking inside the active pocket of receptor protein PDB ID: 2OOT represented in ribbon form, a human glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) established marker for prostate-cancer seeFig. 1while remaining PSMA-P1 and [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 docking with receptor proteins (PDB ID's: 2OOT, 2XW1, 2ZCH and 2XV7) and their adjustment inside the active pockets magnified form is represented in Fig. S3 and S4. Which is further elaborated in 2D diagrams to represent ligand and protein bonding and nonbonding interactions.Fig. 2 (A)shows that PSMA-P1 interacted with receptor protein PDB-ID 2OOTviahydrogen bonding with residuesi.e.GLY 548, TYR 234, ASN 698, LYS 207.

Docking simulation procedure validated through reference compounds HYNIC-ALUG and [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-ALUG and docked with PDB ID: 2OOT receptor is shown in Fig. S5. Furthermore, the experimental logP(−2.55 ± 0.130) is close to the calculated values (clogP−4.177 and clogS−1.007), supporting the validity ofin silicostudies. Toxicity risk calculations also predicted no mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive toxicities (Tables S3 and S4). PSMA quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) calculations were performed for the PSMA-P1 ligand and [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 complex. The HOMO–LUMO energy gap was found 0.17292 eV for the PSMA-P1 ligand and 0.01085 eV for [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 indicating more reactivity of the complex as compared to the non-labeled molecule, as shown inFig. 3.

Compound 2 was synthesized by reacting 2-CTCresin with Fmoc-Lys(Alloc)-OH (1) followed by removal of Fmoc group generated 3. The core PSMA-binding motif (compound 6) was synthesized by reacting compound 4 (t-Bu-Glu·HCl) with triphosgene and DIPEA at 0 °C to form intermediate isocyanate 5, which was then coupled with 2-CTC-Lys (Alloc) to yield compound 6. The allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) protecting group was removed by Pd[P(C6H5)3]4catalyst to give 7 and followed by the reaction with Fmoc-Phe-OH using coupling reagents such as TBTU & HOBT to obtain 8. The Fmoc group was selectively deprotected from 8 using 20% piperidine/DMF and produced 9. Similarly, Fmoc-6-Ahx-OH conjugated to compound 9, followed by removing the Fmoc group generated 11 by following the same protocol described above. To obtain compound 12, compound 11 was reacted with HYNIC-Boc in the presence of the coupling agents HOBT and TBTU. Subsequently, 2-CTC resin, and other bulky functional groups (Boc andt-Bu) were simultaneously removed by 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of TFA and DCM was employed for the synthesis of compound 13. PSMA-P1 (Scheme S1). The final compound 12 was purified by prep-HPLC (Fig. 4) and confirmed by LC-MS (Fig. S8), and1H-NMR,13C-NMR (Fig. S9 and S10).

[99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was prepared using a straightforward one-step kit-based labeling method. Radiochemical purity was evaluated using both radio-TLC and radio-HPLC techniques. Analysis by radio-thin layer chromatography (radio-TLC) involved two systems to effectively differentiate [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 complex from impurities including [99mTc]NaTcO4(Free99mTc) and [99mTc]TcO2·nH2O (Colloid). The radio-TLC chromatogram for the labeled complex and these impurities in both systems is shown inFig. 5. In acetone, [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 complex stayed at baseline (Rf= 0.1–0.2) and the solvent carried free99mTc toward the front (Rf= 0.9–0.1) (Fig. 5A). Using ACN : H2O (1 : 1) as the developing solvent, [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 migrated with the solvent front (Rf= 0.9–1.0) and free Na[99mTcO4] remained at the origin (Rf= 0–0.1) (Fig. 5B). Moreover, radio-HPLC analysis showed a retention time of 14.5 minutes from the [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (Fig. 6). Both radio-TLC and radio-HPLC confirmed a radiochemical purity ≥99%. Furthermore, the proposed structure of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1, illustrating the coordination of the ligand with99mTc is depicted inScheme 1.

Thein vitrostability of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was evaluated in both saline and human serum at 37 °C and demonstrated high stability for up to 4 hours (Fig. 7). This result indicates that ≥95% of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 remains intact and stable under physiological conditions, which is crucial for its potential use in diagnostic imaging. Additionally, to assess its lipophilicity, the partition coefficient (logD) of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 involved partitioning the compound between octanol and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The logDvalue obtained was −2.55 ± 0.130, indicating its hydrophilic nature, which may support its biodistribution in targeting tissues with minimal off-target uptake. These characteristics underscore the promise of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 forin vivoimaging applications.

The cell uptake results for [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 in the 22Rv1 cell line, presented inFig. 8A, indicate a marked difference between the non-blockade and blockade conditions. In the non-blockade condition, [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 exhibited a high uptake of 22%. However, when cells were pre-treated with 2-PMPA to block PSMA receptors, uptake significantly decreased to 5%, representing a substantial 77% reduction. Saturation binding assays with 22RV1 cells were conducted to evaluate the binding affinity of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1. [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 exhibited strong binding to 22Rv1 cells confirming high affinity for PSMA. The saturation binding curve is shown inFig. 8B. The estimated dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated using nonlinear regression (16.14 ± 1.452 nM) highlights the effectiveness of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 for targeted imaging in prostate cancer diagnostics.

In 22Rv1 tumor-bearing BALB/c male mice, [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was administered at 1 and 4 hours post-tail vein injection (Table 1).[99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 demonstrated tumor uptake of (1.91 ± 0.91% ID g−1) at 1 hour and (1.68 ± 0.16% ID g−1) (P≤ 0.001) decreased at 4 h post injection. As predicted, the kidney showed a low concentration of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 conjugate at 1 h and further decreased at 4 h post-injection as compared to [99mTc] Tc-HYNIC-ALUG. After co-injection of 2-PMPA, the kidney uptake was prominently reduced to (5.70 ± 0.67% ID g−1) at 1 hour and (3.86 ± 0.65% ID g−1) at 4 hours after injection, respectively. However, the study is limited by the small sample size and the use of a single tumor model. Additionally, inter-animal variability in tracer uptake introduces some imprecision in the quantification of biodistribution results.

Data are presented as % ID g−1(mean ± SD;n= 4). Blocking studies were conducted by co-injecting 100 μg of 2-PMPA. Statistical significance was denoted as *p≤ 0.001; *** high uptake.

To assess thein vivoPSMA-targeting potential of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 imaging, whole-body SPECT/CT scans were conducted at 4 hours post-injection in BALB/c male nude mice bearing 22Rv1 tumors.[99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 exhibited enhanced tumor-to-background contrast and was eliminatedviathe kidneys (Fig. 9A). Tumor uptake was entirely inhibited when co-injected with 2-PMPA (Fig. 9B).

A preliminary clinical evaluation of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was performed in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). SPECT/CT imaging is shown inFig. 10following an injection of 370 MBq of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1. The images demonstrated physiological tracer uptake in various organs, consistent with expected biodistribution. Notably, there was distinct uptake observed in the D9 vertebra and the left median lobe of the prostate, indicating areas of PSMA expression. The imaging also highlighted [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 sensitivity in identifying lymph node metastases, underscoring its potential as a promising PSMA-targeted SPECT radiotracer for detecting metastatic PCa. This initial result supports the compound's further exploration for broader clinical use in PCa imaging, providing a specific and effective tool for detecting PSMA-positive lesions.

Specific and strong interaction of the Glu-Urea-Lys motif with PSMA has been confirmed through PET/CT imaging techniques. The recent development of cadmium–zinc–telluride (CZT) semiconductor detectors has improved the image quality of SPECT/CT, enhancing resolution and reducing scanning time. Given widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and favorable physical properties,99mTc is well-suited for SPECT/CT,40particularly in setting where PET/CT is not available providing an effective alternative for diagnosis of cancer.

Urea-based99mTc-labeled PSMA inhibitors have been developed by using variety of different linkers and chelator to tumor targeting potential for PCa imaging. Hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC) has emerged as a valuable bifunctional chelator for99mTc due to its capacity to bind in one or two coordination sites, making it necessary to add coligand ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine to stabilize the99mTc-core. This approach enhances radiochemical yield and stability, inspiring further research into HYNIC-labeled PSMA agents, such as [99mTc]Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA,41, [99mTc]-PSMA-T4,22which have shown improved imaging and better pharmacokinetics.

Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of newly designed PSMA-P1 (Tables S3 and S4). The ligand PSMA-P1 and radiolabeled complex [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 were analyzed to check the interaction with prostate-specific receptors models (PDB code: 2ZCH, 2XW1, 2XV7, and 2OOT), revealing binding affinities of −0.55, 0.85, −2.79, −4.98 kcal mol−1, respectively (Table S1). The PSMA receptor model 2OOT showed the strongest binding affinity with [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1, having a docking score of −4.98 kcal mol−1and an inhibition constant (Ki) of 69.14 μM, and comparable to previous,24demonstrating a slightly higher binding affinity for [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-P1 (−4.98 kcal mol−1)versusthe non-labeled peptide, PSMA-P1 (−4.46 kcal mol−1), indicating successful binding and structural suitability. [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-ALUG was also simulated with the 2OOT model (Fig. S4), facilitating direct comparison. PSMA-P1 showed a binding affinity of −2.79 kcal mol−1with aKiof 222.81 μM (Table S1), which was slightly higher than HYNIC-ALUG binding energy of −2.19 kcal mol−1andKiof 253 μM (Table S2). Notably, theKiof [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 was found to be lower (69.14 μM) than that of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-ALUG (80.2 μM), suggesting a tighter binding. The enhanced binding energy of the labeled peptide [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 (−4.98 kcal mol−1) relative to the unlabeled PSMA-P1 (−4.46 kcal mol−1) further supports the docking's effectiveness. In the QSAR analysis, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (0.01085 eV) and dipole moment (7.0141 debye) demonstrated significant bioreactivity and polarizability for the [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1. The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MESP) analysis, illustrated inFig. 1, identified a highly electrophilic zone (highlighted in red) around the99mTc-labeled regionFig. 2, suggesting enhanced reactivity compared to the non-labeled section inFig. 1, making it well-suited for forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues.

The SPECT/CT image (Fig. 10) illustrates the distribution of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 in a prostate cancer patient, with notable uptake detected in the kidneys, salivary and lacrimal glands, intestines, and urinary bladder and PSMA expression in specific areas (Fig. 10A) which is concordance with the [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-4.42InFig. 10B–E, SPECT/CT images reveal a marked accumulation of the radiotracer in the D9 vertebra, which is consistent with metastatic involvement. This localization supports the use of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-P1 in detecting skeletal metastases, as PSMA is often overexpressed in metastatic lesions. Significant uptake in both lobes of the prostate gland, indicating elevated PSMA expression within the primary tumor site (Fig. 10F and G). This localized tracer accumulation in the prostate confirms its value in identifying areas with high PSMA expression. (Fig. 10H and I) Demonstrate a PSMA-avid area specifically within the left median lobe of the prostate, suggesting focal PSMA expression in this region. Overall, this distribution pattern supports the utility of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 for effectively targeting PSMA-expressing cells in primary tumor sites and potential metastatic locations, and further extended for evaluation in more patients.

The PSMA-P1 ligand was designed, successfully synthesized, and labeled with99mTc to develop [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1. Molecular docking studies indicated that both PSMA-P1 and [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 exhibited a strong binding affinity. The [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1 displayed excellentin vitrostability (≥95% for up to 4 h) and high PSMA-specific affinity. A stable, reproducible, lyophilized kit was developed for easy preparation for [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-P1. The biodistribution and small animal SPECT/CT showed high tumor uptake and retention. A first patient study demonstrated its effectiveness as a diagnostic agent for PSMA-expressing lesions, with further clinical evaluation needed to confirm its broader applicability.
