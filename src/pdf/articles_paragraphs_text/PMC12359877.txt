Delayed neurological sequelae (DNS) caused by carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning remain a significant problem.

A 50-year-old man was admitted to his base hospital with an impaired consciousness level (day X). His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3, and the fraction of carboxyhaemoglobin on arterial blood gas analysis was 51.2%. He was referred to our hospital for treatment with a diagnosis of CO poisoning. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where he received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and steroid pulse therapy (SPT). On day X + 3, his level of consciousness noticeably improved. The patient was discharged on day X + 14. Outpatient follow-up was conducted, and the patient had no complications, including DNS, until day X + 49.

This case suggests that the combination of SPT and HBOT may not only improve acute neurological recovery but also help prevent the development of DNS after CO poisoning.

Delayed neurological sequelae (DNS) caused by carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning remain a significant problem. DNS can occur after CO poisoning and present with neurological symptoms following acute consciousness disturbances. These symptoms include memory impairment, disorientation, apraxia, agnosia, gait disturbances, and Parkinson-like symptoms [1]. Currently, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the only intervention recognised to be effective in preventing the development of DNS after CO poisoning [2]. In addition, there are no established treatments for acute-phase consciousness disturbances or DNS caused by CO poisoning. Recently, the use of HBOT in combination with steroid pulse therapy (SPT) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach. Herein, we report the case of a patient with severe acute-phase impaired consciousness due to CO poisoning, who underwent HBOT and SPT.

The patient was a 50-year-old man with no relevant medical history. He used a blowtorch to thaw the frost in the large refrigerator of a grocery store that he managed from 5 PM on day X. A coworker found the patient unconscious in the large refrigerator 7 h after entering. Upon arrival at the first hospital, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 3 (eye, 1; verbal, 1; motor, 1). Physical examination revealed a body temperature of 32.2 °C, sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 111 beats/min, normal haemodynamic parameters with a blood pressure of 121/72 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on supplemental oxygen with a 10 L reservoir mask. Head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the first hospital are shown in Fig.1(a-c).

Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severely high carboxyhaemoglobin levels and lactic acidosis with a fraction of carboxyhaemoglobin (FCO-Hb) of 51.2%, pH of 7.052, and a lactate level of 174 mg/dL. On head MRI, high-signal-intensity areas were observed in the bilateral globus pallidus on both diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Based on these results, the patient was referred to our hospital for CO poisoning treatment after rewarming.

Upon arrival at our hospital 15 h after exposure, his GCS score was 10 (eye, 3; verbal, 2; motor, 5). His body temperature had improved to 35.8 °C, and no other vital signs showed any notable abnormalities. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, heart rate of 110 beats/min, and no abnormalities, including the absence of J waves.

The patient was then admitted to the intensive care unit. We decided to administer SPT in addition to HBOT. HBOT was administered at 2 ATA for 60 min, twice daily from the first hospitalisation day to the second hospitalisation day, and once daily from the 5th hospitalisation day to the 9th hospitalisation day and from the 12th hospitalisation day to the 14th hospitalisation day, for a total of 10 days. Additionally, 1000 mg of methylprednisolone was administered from the 2nd hospitalisation day to the 4th hospitalisation day, followed by oral prednisolone for tapering. On the third day of hospitalisation, his level of consciousness improved, with a GCS score of 15 (eye, 4; verbal, 5; motor, 6). However, the patient, who originally spoke quickly and loudly, began to speak much more slowly and softly. Additionally, his movements became sluggish, and tremors were observed in his limbs. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale test revealed a score of 66, indicating mild intellectual disability. The patient experienced no side effects of the HBOT or SPT and was discharged home on the 14th hospitalisation day. His treatment course is summarised in Fig.2.

After discharge, outpatient follow-up was conducted to gradually reduce and discontinue the steroids, which were continued until 49 days after CO exposure without any complications, including DNS.

Despite growing attention to the prevention of DNS following CO poisoning, no standardised treatment protocols have been established. HBOT remains the only widely accepted intervention for acute management and DNS prevention [2].

In this case, HBOT was initiated promptly after the patient’s transfer to our hospital. However, due to hypothermia and severe lactic acidosis at the referring facility, a broader differential diagnosis for the impaired consciousness was likely considered. HBOT was also unavailable at the referral hospital. Although the CO-Hb level and clinical presentation would have warranted urgent HBOT, these factors might have contributed to the prolonged work-up. This highlights the importance of early HBOT initiation, widely supported in the literature as critical for improving neurological outcomes in cases involving unconsciousness and elevated COHb levels [3].

Pathophysiologically, CO exposure induces immune-mediated demyelination through oxidative damage to the myelin basic protein (MBP) [4]. Animal studies and clinical reports suggest that corticosteroids may mitigate this process by reducing inflammation and preventing CD4 + cell apoptosis [4,5]. Elevated MBP levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with DNS, and steroid therapy has been shown to reduce MBP levels and improve outcomes [6].

For example, Xiang et al. demonstrated that patients receiving HBOT plus dexamethasone had significantly lower CSF MBP levels and improved cognitive scores compared to those receiving HBOT only [7]. Another prospective study reported a lower incidence of DNS among patients treated with intravenous dexamethasone [8].

However, the referenced study was retrospective in nature and involved a shift in treatment strategies, introducing potential biases such as selection and temporal confounding [8]. The reduced DNS incidence may have been influenced by other factors, including increased HBOT use or improved overall care. As with all retrospective studies, the findings should be interpreted with caution, and prospective randomised trials are needed to confirm the results.

SPT may also benefit CO-related encephalopathy through dual mechanisms: suppressing cytokine-mediated inflammation and reducing vasogenic oedema by stabilising the endothelial tight junctions [9]. These effects are also relevant to other inflammatory brain conditions such as encephalitis and autoimmune encephalopathy [10–12].

Nevertheless, corticosteroids may, in some cases, induce or exacerbate encephalopathy [10]. This dual nature underscores the complexity of their role in neurological disorders and highlights the need for careful patient selection and close monitoring when using steroids in CO poisoning.

CO toxicity involves the high-affinity binding of CO to haemoglobin and inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, leading to cellular hypoxia and cerebral oedema [13,14]. In this context, SPT may help reduce inflammation and brain oedema, potentially improving outcomes [15].

This case presentation suggests that SPT, as an adjunct to HBOT, may reduce the risk of DNS following CO poisoning.　These therapies target key mechanisms of injury-impaired oxygen delivery, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oedema. While this case is suggestive, causality cannot be established due to its single-patient nature. Further prospective studies are required to confirm therapeutic efficacy and define optimal protocols.
