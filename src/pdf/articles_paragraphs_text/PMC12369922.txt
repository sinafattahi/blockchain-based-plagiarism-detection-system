The response to ruxolitinib after 6 months (RR6) model allows early identification of ruxolitinib‐treated myelofibrosis (MF) patients with poorer overall survival (OS); however, it is less applicable to lower‐risk patients.

To further explore this, the authors performed a subanalysis of the “RUX‐MF” study (NCT06516406) with an aim to validate the RR6 and to develop a score specific for intermediate‐1 DIPSS/MYSEC‐PM risk patients.

Among the 776 evaluable patients, 34.4%, 47.8%, and 17.8% were at low, intermediate, and high RR6 risk, with 5‐year OS of 64.1%, 51.8%, and 44.5%, respectively (p< .001). In the 428 intermediate‐1 patients, the RR6 model did not discriminate between intermediate and low‐risk patients (5‐year OS: 74.4% vs. 72.0%,p= .24). The intermediate‐1 specific RR6 (iRR6) model was therefore developed by incorporating new variables: underdosed ruxolitinib with respect to platelet count at one or more time points (hazard ratio [HR], 3.91;p< .001), absence of palpable spleen reduction by ≥50% at 6 months (HR, 1.45;p= .02), and red blood cell transfusion requirement at all time points (HR, 1.85;p= .01). The iRR6 model stratified patients into three risk categories: low (score 0, 20.3%), intermediate (score 1–2, 45.8%), and high‐risk (score >2, 33.9%), with 5‐year OS of 84.8%, 76.4%, and 56.6%, respectively (p< .0001). The iRR6 model was validated in a cohort of 95 intermediate‐1 risk patients from the Moffitt Cancer Center, yielding stratification into the same three risk categories, with 5‐year OS of 83.3% (low‐risk), 71.7% (intermediate‐risk), and 54.5% (high‐risk) (p= .01).

The iRR6 model provides a more refined tool for the identification of intermediate‐1 MF patients who may benefit from early therapy shift.

The RR6 model allows for early identification of ruxolitinib‐treated myelofibrosis patients at higher risk for poorer overall survival but is less applicable to lower‐risk patients. A subanalysis of the Italian “RUX‐M” study, validated by a cohort from the Moffitt Cancer Center, led to the development of the intermediate‐1 specific RR6 (iRR6) model, which is specific for intermediate‐1 risk patients and may complement the RR6 score, offering a more granular risk stratification in patients with less advanced disease.

At the time of data cutoff for the current analysis (February 2024), the retrospective study “RUX‐MF” collected 1055 MF patients, treated with ruxolitinib outside clinical trials, that were used as training cohort to validate the RR6 model.

Inclusion criteria in this subanalysis consisted of ≥6 months of follow‐up after initiation of ruxolitinib and available information on complete blood count, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements, spleen length by palpation and ruxolitinib dose at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of ruxolitinib therapy. At initiation of ruxolitinib, all patients had platelet count >50 × 109/L and spleen palpable at ≥5 cm below the costal margin (BCM).

Subsequently, we focused on intermediate‐1 risk patients, to evaluate early predictors of worse overall survival in this specific population. A validation cohort comprising 95 patients with intermediate‐1 risk MF treated with ruxolitinib at the Moffitt Cancer Center (Florida) was also employed.

The RUX‐MF study (NCT06516406) was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional review boards of the participating centers and the standards of the Helsinki Declaration. The promoter of this study was the IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero‐Universitaria S. Orsola‐Malpighi, Bologna, which obtained approval from the Area Vasta Emilia Centro Ethics Committee (approval file number: 048/2022/Oss/AOUBo). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of participating centers (protocol code: RUX‐MF) and has no commercial support.

Continuous variables are expressed as medians and ranges or means and standard deviations, whereas categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. We used the Wilcoxon‐Mann‐Whitney rank‐sum test or thet‐test for comparisons between groups, and associations between categorical variables (2‐way tables) were tested using the Fisher exact test or the χ2test, as appropriate.

These variables were selected based on their mechanistic relevance to disease biology and treatment response in ruxolitinib‐treated MF patients. In particular, changes in hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts over time were evaluated as indicators of disease evolution or therapy‐related cytopenias. The requirement for RBC transfusion was included as a marker for persistent anemia and bone marrow dysfunction, both of which are known to have an adverse impact on prognosis.27Underdosing of ruxolitinib relative to platelet count was tested in place of absolute dosing, to account for treatment intensity normalized to patient‐specific hematologic tolerance. This definition reflects adherence to the approved prescribing information and is more consistent with previous data showing that ruxolitinib underdosing may impact treatment outcomes.28Finally, spleen response was assessed using a stricter cutoff (≥50% reduction by palpation), which was hypothesized to better reflect meaningful disease control in intermediate‐1 risk patients, who are more likely to achieve spleen shrinkage than high‐risk individuals. All variables were selected a priori based on clinical plausibility and were uniformly available across the study population.

Survival analysis comparing risk categories were performed using Kaplan–Meier curves, and differences were evaluated using log‐rank test. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of ruxolitinib start, to either death, last contact, or ASCT.

Tests were two‐sided, andpvalues <.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed using STATA/SE software version 18.0 (StataCorp).

At the start of ruxolitinib, 55.2% of the patients were at intermediate‐1 risk. The median baseline hemoglobin level was 11.2 g/dL, with 132 (17.0%) patients having RBC transfusion requirement. The median platelet count was 265 × 109/L (range: 56–1887), and 49.9% of the patients had splenomegaly palpable at ≥10 cm below the costal margin. Additionally, 58.0% of patients were highly symptomatic, with a TSS ≥20.

The distribution of the RR6 variables was as follows: 33.4% of the patients received a ruxolitinib dose <20 mg twice daily at baseline, a proportion that increased to 64.2% at 3 months and 74.6% at 6 months. RBC transfusion requirement was recorded in 17% of patients at baseline, increasing to 34% at 3 months and remaining stable at 32.6% at 6 months. Approximately one‐third (31.7%) of patients failed to achieve a spleen reduction by at least 30% compared to baseline (SR30) at 3 months, with 37.6% not achieving SR30 at 6 months.

The RR6 model was first applied to the entire cohort. The RR6 model stratified patients into three risk groups: low‐risk (score 0,n= 267, 34.4%), intermediate‐risk (score 1–2,n= 371, 47.8%), and high‐risk (score >2,n= 138, 17.8%). The 5‐year OS rates were 64.1% for low‐risk patients, 51.8% for intermediate‐risk patients, and 44.5% for high‐risk patients (p< .0001), with statistically significant differences across all the risk categories (low vs. intermediate,p= .003; intermediate vs. high,p= .02; low vs. high,p= .0001) (Figure1).

Of the total cohort, 428 patients were classified as intermediate‐1 risk according to DIPSS or MYSEC‐PM at ruxolitinib start (Table1).

The distribution of the RR6 variables within the intermediate‐1 cohort was found to be consistent with that observed in the entire cohort: 57.0% of patients were receiving a ruxolitinib dose <20 mg twice daily at baseline, increasing to 69.4% at 3 months and 71.5% at 6 months. RBC transfusion requirement was recorded in 4.2% of patients at baseline, increasing sharply to 16.7% at 3 months, and 15.7% at 6 months. Approximately 41.4% of patients failed to achieve SR30 at 3 months, with 33.1% not reaching SR30 at 6 months (TableS1).

In univariate analysis, RBC transfusion requirements at all time points (HR, 2.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30–5.40],p= .007) and RBC transfusion requirement at 3 and 6 months (HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.10–2.17],p= 0.011) were significantly associated with a worse OS, whereas ruxolitinib dose <20 twice daily (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.73–1.44],p= .50) and failure to achieve SR30 at 3 and/or 6 months (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.90–1.52],p= .08), did not correlate with a worse prognosis. In multivariate analysis, only RBC transfusion requirement at all time points remained significantly associated with OS (HR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.10–4.40],p= .05). Ruxolitinib dose <20 mg twice daily at all time points (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.80–1.52],p= .49) and failure to achieve SR30 at 3 and/or 6 months (HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 0.98–1.99],p= .06) did not show significant predictive value for survival in this specific cohort (FigureS2).

When the RR6 model was applied to the intermediate‐1 cohort, the 5‐year OS was 74.4% in the low‐risk group (n= 121, 28.3%) and 72.0% in the intermediate‐risk group (n= 223, 52.1%), indicating no significant difference between the two categories (p= .24). However, the high‐risk group (n= 84, 19.6%) showed a significantly poorer 5‐year OS of 57.4% (vs. low‐risk,p= .004; vs. intermediate‐risk,p= .009) (Figure2).

New variables were tested in both univariate and multivariable analyses to improve risk stratification in intermediate‐1 patients (Figure3). The following factors were found to be significant in multivariate analysis: underdosed ruxolitinib at any time point (HR, 3.91 [95% CI, 2.61–5.85],p< .001); absence of SR50 at 6 months (HR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.06–1.99],p= .02); RBC transfusion requirement at all time points (HR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.16–2.94],p= 0.01). RBC transfusion requirement at two time points was significant just in univariate analysis (univariate: HR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.05–4.36],p= 0.05; multivariate: HR, 1.74 [95% CI, 0.84–3.59],p= 0.14).

Variables associated with overall survival in the intermediate‐1 risk cohort. CI indicates confidence interval; Hb, hemoglobin; HR, hazard ratio; RBC, red blood cells; RUX, ruxolitinib; WBC, white blood cells.

Based on these findings, the intermediate‐1 RR6 (iRR6) model was developed, with the following point assignment: 2 points for underdosed ruxolitinib at any time points; 1.5 points for absence of SR50 at 6 months and for RBC transfusion requirement at all time points; and 1 point for RBC transfusion requirement at two time points.

The distribution of these variables in the intermediate‐1 cohort showed that: 40.0% received underdosed ruxolitinib at baseline, increasing at 45.6% and 41.8% of patients at 3 and 6 months respectively; 52.1% failed to achieve SR50 at 6 months; 18.7% required RBC transfusions at two time points, and 15.7% required transfusions at all time points (TableS1).

The iRR6 model was then applied to the intermediate‐1 cohort, effectively stratifying patients into three risk groups: low‐risk (score 0): 20.3% (n =87) of patients with a 5‐year OS of 84.8% (median OS: not reached); intermediate‐risk (score 1–2): 45.8% (n =196) of patients with a 5‐year OS of 76.4% (median OS: 9.24 years; 95% CI, 6.63–not reached); high‐risk (score >2): 33.9% of patients with a 5‐year OS of 56.6% (median OS: 5.77 years; 95% CI, 4.80–6.29) (p< .0001) (Figure4).

To evaluate its performance across distinct prognostic classifications, we also applied the iRR6 model separately to PMF and SMF patients. In both the intermediate‐1 DIPSS‐defined PMF cohort and the MYSEC‐PM‐defined SMF cohort, the iRR6 model consistently identified three prognostic categories with significantly different overall survival (PMF: low‐risk, median OS: not reached; intermediate‐risk, median OS: 9.25 years; 95% CI, 5.93–not reached; high‐risk, median OS: 4.66 years; 95% CI, 3.42–5.77,p< .0001; SMF: low‐risk, median OS: not reached; intermediate‐risk: 9.58 years; 95% CI, 6.64–not reached; high‐risk, median OS: 6.29 years; 95% CI, 5.47–7.27,p< .0001) (FigureS3).

To validate the iRR6 model, it was tested on a separate cohort of 95 intermediate‐1 patients from the Moffitt Cancer Center. The median age of this cohort was 63.4 years (range: 25.1–87.3) and 55.8% were male. Their baseline characteristics were comparable to those of the RUX‐MF cohort (TableS2).

The distribution of iRR6 variables in the Moffitt cohort was similar to the RUX‐MF cohort: 53.7% of patients received ruxolitinib underdosed at baseline, falling to 41.1% and 37.9% at 3 and 6 months, respectively; 55.8% failed to achieve SR50 at 6 months; 17.9% needed transfusion requirement at two time points, and 5.3% at all time points (TableS1).

The iRR6 model was successfully applied to the Moffitt cohort, yielding significant stratification into the same three risk groups: low‐risk: 16.8% (n= 16) of patients with a 5‐year OS of 83.3%; intermediate‐risk: 34.7% of patients (n= 33) with a 5‐year OS of 71.7%; high‐risk: 48.4% of patients (n= 46) with a 5‐year OS of 54.5% (p= .01) (FigureS4).

The primary result of the present study is the validation of the RR6 model. In contrast to previous validations, in which intermediate and low‐risk patients exhibited nonsignificantly different survival rates, our cohort demonstrated that the RR6 effectively distinguished three categories with distinct survival expectations. This was likely attributable to the substantial patient sample size, which may have counterbalanced the inherent limitations of retrospective data collection.

The limitations of this study are acknowledged, including its retrospective nature, the suboptimal reliability of palpation for the assessment of spleen response, and the lack of information on patient adherence to ruxolitinib. Another limitation of this study is the incomplete availability of molecular data. As the RUX‐MF registry included patients treated from 2013 onward, next‐generation sequencing was not systematically implemented in clinical workflows at that time and was performed in only a subset of cases. Therefore, risk stratification at baseline was conducted using DIPSS or MYSEC‐PM, in alignment with real‐world clinical practice. Although we acknowledge that current prognostic models increasingly incorporate molecular features, our analysis focused on dynamic projection after 6 months of therapy, aiming to identify early indicators of long‐term outcome in intermediate‐1 risk patients. Prospective studies with comprehensive genomic profiling may further enhance the integration between molecular and treatment‐based risk models.

Despite these limitations, the validation of the iRR6 model in an independent cohort from the Moffitt Cancer Center lends further support to the generalizability and reliability of the model. Furthermore, a high degree of similarity was observed in the distribution of iRR6 variables between the Moffitt cohort and the original RUX‐MF cohort, suggesting that the iRR6 model can be applied broadly to intermediate‐1 patients treated with ruxolitinib, regardless of geographic or institutional disparities.

The iRR6 score does not contradict the original RR6 model but rather integrates it. The RR6 score continues to serve as a valuable tool for identifying patients who are likely to experience poorer outcomes during ruxolitinib therapy and its use in clinical practice must be encouraged. The iRR6 score has been developed to complement it, offering a more granular risk stratification in patients with less advanced disease, with the potential to mitigate the risks associated with prolonged ineffective therapies and delayed transitions to alternative treatments in this setting.

Further investigation is required to determine whether and which early interventions may ultimately improve outcomes. This should be the subject of future studies.
