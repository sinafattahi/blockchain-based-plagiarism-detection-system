Scrub typhus, also known as Tsutsugamushi disease (TD), is an acute febrile illness that poses a significant public health threat to nearly one billion people in the Asia‐Pacific region. The disease is caused byOrientia tsutsugamushi(OT) and is primarily transmitted through the bite of chigger mite larvae. Due to its nonspecific clinical manifestations, early diagnosis is challenging, often leading to misdiagnosis or untreated cases. Yunnan Province, located on China's border, reports the highest annual incidence of scrub typhus, highlighting the need to better understandOTinfection in both human patients and small mammals in this region.

In this study, clinical data on scrub typhus cases in Xiangyun County People's Hospital were retrospectively collected. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and semi‐nested PCR were used to amplify the 56‐kDa type‐specific antigen (TSA) from samples collected from 64 patients and 93 small mammals, representing six genera and nine species, in Xiangyun County, Yunnan Province, China. Complete sequences of the 56‐kDa TSA for each genotype were obtained through primer‐walking and subjected to evolutionary and recombination analyses.

A total of 377 scrub typhus cases were enrolled at Xiangyun County Hospital from July 2015 to November 2020. The detection rates ofOTin patients and small mammals were 28.13% (18/64) and 13.98% (13/93), respectively. Nine full‐length 56‐kDa TSA genes were identified, comprising four distinct genotypes: Karp‐like (n= 3), Kato‐like (n= 3), Gilliam (n= 2), and TA763 (n= 1). Patients infected with the Karp‐like exhibited significantly more severe clinical symptoms, and the Karp‐like genotype of patients was relatively common in Xiangyun County of Yunnan Province. The Gilliam‐like and Karp‐like genotypes were detected in the infected small mammals, andApodemus chevrieriis a dominant species in cultivated fields. Recombination analysis revealed genetic overlap among strains of similar or different genotypes, suggesting that genetic diversity may contribute to the increased incidence of scrub typhus.

At least four genotypes ofOTwere present among patients, and it was infected byOTthat at least four species of  infected small mammals in cultivated areas and at least three species of infected small mammals in residential areas from Xiangyun County, Yunnan Province. The diversity ofOTgenotypes and infected small mammals, which causes frequent genetic recombination, is the main reason for the adaptive selection due to the genetic evolution ofOT.

Scrub typhus is caused byOrientia tsutsugamushi(OT). In this study, the detection rates ofOTin patients and small mammals were 28.13% (18/64) and 13.98% (13/93), respectively. Nine full‐length 56‐kDa TSA genes were identified, comprising four distinct genotypes: Karp‐like (n= 3), Kato‐like (n= 3), Gilliam (n= 2), and TA763 (n= 1).

Tsutsugamushi disease (TD), commonly known as scrub typhus, is an acute febrile disease caused by the bacteriumOrientia tsutsugamushi(OT). This disease is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of chigger mite larvae. Chigger mites are currently the only known vector of scrub typhus. Their life cycle consists of seven distinct stages: egg, prelarva, larva, nymphochrysalis, nymph, imagochrysalis, and adult. Only the larval stage (chigger) is ectoparasitic. Yunnan Province exhibits significantly higher species diversity of chigger mites compared to other regions in China and in other countries. Small mammals serve as the most common hosts for these mites (Jain et al.2024; Kurup et al.2013). Scrub typhus is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions across the Asia‐Pacific region, spanning from Afghanistan in the west to Japan, the Philippines and New Guinea in the east, and from northern Australia in the south to southern Russia in the north—a region known as the ‘tsutsugamushi triangle’ (Watt et al.2003; Watt and Parola2003). The disease is characterized by a range of clinical manifestations, including fever, eschar (a distinctive ulcer), lymphadenopathy, and rash. In severe cases, scrub typhus can lead to significant organ damage or even the fatal (Liu et al.2009). Due to its subtle early symptoms, scrub typhus is often misdiagnosed and underestimated. Each year, scrub typhus affects at least 1 million people, with a fatality rate that can reach up to 15% in cases where the disease is misdiagnosed or untreated (Bonell et al.2017; He et al.2024).

OTis an intracellular, obligate parasitic bacterium with a short rod shape, measuring ∼0.3–0.5 µm in width and 0.8–2.0 µm in length. It is classified as a Gram‐negative bacterium (Atwal et al.2022). Owing to the pronounced disparities in cell–wall structure, chemical composition, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequence, and distribution ofOTrelative to other rickettsiae, as early as 1995, Turmura et al. (1995) put forward the proposition of reclassifyingOToutside the genusRickettsiae. The specificity ofOTantigens is primarily determined by the 56‐kDa type‐specific antigen (56‐kDa TSA), an outer membrane protein with an open reading frame (ORF) of ∼1600 base pairs (Yang et al.2019). Variations in the 56‐kDa TSA have been observed amongOTstrains in different endemic regions worldwide, reflecting genetic diversity among epidemic strains (Jeong et al.2012).

Traditional serotyping ofOTis complex, time‐consuming, and susceptible to cross‐contamination. However, advancements in molecular biology techniques and the increased clinical awareness have revealed substantial diversity among strains. A growing number of new genotypes and subtypes have been identified in patients and rodents from various scrub typhus endemic regions. Notable strains or genotypes include Gilliam (JG), Karp (JP), Kato, Kawasaki, Kuroki, Saitama, and Shimokoshi in Japan, as well as Boryong in Korea and TA763, TA678, TA686, TA716, and TH1817 in Southeast Asia and Australia (Ramaiah et al.2018). Recent reports of scrub typhus in the Middle East, Africa, and South America—the so called non‐traditional tsutsugamushi triangle—underscore the fact that our understanding ofOTis still incomplete. The global genotype of scrub typhus has expanded and become increasingly complex (Walker and Mendell2023; Weitzel et al.2018).

Yunnan Province, a high‐risk area for scrub typhus, reports the highest annual prevalence of the disease in China (Tian et al.2024; Wu et al.2016; Zheng et al.2019). Understanding the epidemiology and genetic diversity ofOTis important for improving rapid diagnostic methods and developing effective vaccines in endemic regions. To address this need, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity ofOT. Furthermore, we analyzed and compared the 56‐kDa antigen of differentOTgenotypes from patients and small mammals identified in Xiangyun County, Yunnan Province, China.

We retrospectively collected and analyzed clinical data from 377 scrub typhus cases in Xiangyun County People's Hospital from July 2015 to November 2020.

Inclusion criteria were as follows (G. Kim et al.2017): (1) clinically suspected scrub typhus cases with acute febrile illness and compatible symptoms (such as eschar, rash, or lymphadenopathy); (2) laboratory‐confirmed cases meeting at least one of the following: positive IgM of the specific antibodies, PCR detection ofOTDNA, or fourfold IgG titre rise in paired sera; and (3) complete clinical data available. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) confirmed alternative diagnoses (such as malaria, dengue, or bacterial sepsis); (2) incomplete laboratory confirmation or missing critical clinical information; and (3) prior antibiotic use potentially affecting test results. In addition, the blood samples (n= 64 cases) were collected from hospitalized patients between June and November 2020 using standardized vacuum blood collection tubes containing sodium citrate or heparin for subsequent laboratory analysis.

All enrolled patients underwent a thorough clinical evaluation using a standardized case report form that systematically collected data on demographic characteristics, epidemiologic history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings.

Small mammal samples were collected from the residential areas (where people lived and kept livestock) and cultivated areas (living crop and vegetable cultivation) in four towns: Xiangcheng, Shalong, Yunannyi, and Midian, within Xiangyun County (Figure1). Sample collection was facilitated using fried food as bait and live traps (20 × 12 × 10.5 cm, Xiangyun Hong Jin Mouse Cage Factory, Dali, Yunnan, China). Each day, 200 traps were set, generally every 5 m, in the evening and collected the following morning for ∼6 days at each site (Tian et al.2024). Captured small mammals were transported to the laboratory for morphological identification as previously described (Guo et al.2023; Han et al.2024; Huang et al.2023; Tang et al.2024). Anaesthesia was administered in an induction chamber with cotton embedded with isoflurane (1 mL per 500 mL chamber volume) (Acosta‐Jamett et al.2020; Tian et al.2024). Following anaesthesia, the small mammals were euthanized on a warming blanket to reduce stress. Dissections were performed to collect heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and intestinal tissues, which were placed in 2‐mL cryogenic vials (CORNING, Shanghai, China) and stored at −80°C for further analysis. Molecular identification was performed through PCR amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (mt‐Cytb) gene from liver tissue DNA extracts, using commercially available reagents (Bio‐Gener, Hangzhou, China) and the primersL14724andH15915(TableS1) (Guillen‐Servent and Francis2006; Irwin et al.1991). Data on the species, geographical location, altitude (measured with Beidou Navigation Satellite System, China), and air humidity (measured with Peakmeter, Shenzhen, China) of the captured small mammals were recorded.

Antibody detection in patient sera was conducted using the Rapid Tsutsugamushi Immunoglobulin G/Immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) Combo Test Card (NovaBios, USA). The procedure was performed following the manufacturer's instructions.

DNA was extracted from each specimen using the QIAamp DNA Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and semi‐nested PCR were employed to amplify the 56‐kDa type‐specific antigen (TSA) from patients and rodents. Genotype‐specific amplification was achieved through primer‐walking, with primers designed based on the known genome sequences ofOTavailable from NCBI (TableS1) (Long et al.2020; Ohashi et al.1992; S. Zhang et al.2010). For patient samples, nested PCR was used to amplify the 56‐kDa TSA gene. The first round of PCR was performed using ST56K‐F1 and ST56K‐R1 primers with 1 µL of DNA template. The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95°C for initial denaturation, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 47°C for 15 s, 72°C for 20 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. In the second round of PCR, 1 µL of the first‐round product was used as the template with ST56K‐F2 and ST56K‐R2 primers. The cycling conditions were similar to the first round, except that the extension time was reduced to 10 s. For small mammal samples, the 56‐kDa TSA segment was amplified as described in reference using primers pair 3 and pair 4 (Long et al.2020). PCR amplicons were purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (OMEGA Bio‐tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and subsequently sequenced by T‐A cloning or PCR products through Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), with all samples analyzed in triplicate.

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted by using the MEGA‐X software. Sequences from the present study and reference sequences obtained from the NCBI GenBank database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) were aligned by using ClustalX2 and subsequently trimmed to the appropriate size. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by applying the neighbour‐joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications. Sequence homologies were calculated with the DNAstar Lasergene 7.1.0 software package. Geographic mapping ofOTgene distributions was performed by utilizing geographic information software. Statistical analysis was conducted using the SAS software version 9.4. Descriptive data were presented as mean (standard deviation, SD) or median (range). Statistical differences were assessed by applying the chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test.

Recombination events in gene fragments and entire ORF sequences were detected using the RDP4 software (Martin et al.2010). Recombination events were considered significant if thepvalue was <0.05 in more than six detection methods. Further verification of these potential recombination events was conducted using the SimPlot software version 3.5.1.

From July 2015 to November 2020, a total of 377 scrub typhus cases were enrolled at Xiangyun County Hospital. The majority of these samples were from Midian town (125/377, 33.16%) and Xiangcheng town (117/377, 33.03%) (Figure1). Of the 377 patients, 286 (75.86%) were transferred directly from local health centres, while 91 (24.14%) were referred from other hospitals. The patient cohort included 201 males (53.32%) and 176 females (46.68%), with a mean age of 51.06 ± 18.53 years. Most patients (350/377, 92.84%) resided in rural areas, and a substantial proportion (333/377, 88.33%) were employed as farmers. The peak incidence of scrub typhus occurred between August and October, accounting for 291 cases (77.19%), reflecting a typical autumn–winter pattern for the disease. All patients exhibited fever (≥37.30°C), with the highest recorded temperature reaching 41.50°C. The most common clinical symptoms included headache (308/377, 81.70%), shivering (284/377, 75.33%), nausea (301/377, 79.84%), and eschar (273/377, 72.41%). Complications were reported in 312 patients (82.76%) and included liver damage, respiratory failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The median delay from symptom onset to treatment was 7 days, with a range of 6–11 days (Table1).

Demographic information, signs and symptoms, and laboratory results for 377 patients enrolled in a study of scrub typhus, Xiangyun County People's Hospital, July 2015–November 2020.

We measured IgM and IgG antibodies in admission serum samples from 64 enrolled patients by employing colloidal gold assays, and identifiedOTin patient blood through 56‐kDa nested PCR between June and November 2020. Among these, 35 samples (54.69%) tested positive forOTantibodies, with 25 samples positive for IgM, three positive for IgG, and seven positive for both IgM and IgG. Additionally, 18 samples (28.13%, 18/64) were amplified by 56‐kDa nested PCR, which was used for further analysis (χ2= 15.769,p< 0.001).

In the small mammal survey conducted across four sites in Xiangyun County, a total of 93 individuals from six genera and nine species were captured. In residential areas, the prevalence ofOTwas 19.05% (4/21) among Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) (n= 9), Asian house rats (R. tanezumi) (n= 8), and Indo‐Chinese forest rats (R. andamanensis) (n= 4). In cultivated areas, the prevalence was 18.06% (13/72) among Chevrier's field mice (Apodemus chevrieri) (n= 52), large Chinese voles (Eothenomys miletus) (n= 5), Cook's mice (Mus cookii) (n= 5), Indo‐Chinese shrew‐like mice (Mus pahari) (n= 3), Asian grey shrews (Crocidura attenuata) (n= 4), and tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) (n= 3). Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference inOTprevalence between infected small mammals in residential and cultivated areas (p> 0.05) (Figure1and Table2).

We detectedOTfrom 64 patient samples and 93 rodent samples, with detection rates of 28.13% (18/64) and 13.98% (13/93), respectively. Eighteen sequences with amplification were used for phylogenetic analysis, including 12 patients and six small mammals. Reference sequence information was retrieved, including NCBI accession numbers, strain names, isolation hosts, locations, countries, and years (TableS2) (Long et al.2020). Given the genotypic diversity ofOT, we generated nine complete TSA 56 ORF sequences from 31 positive samples based on no more than three samples of the same genotype with similar sequences through gene‐walking. These included three samples from the Karp‐like group (XYP3/4/7, accession numbers:ON745806–ON745808), thee samples from the Kato‐like group (XYP15/40/54, accession numbers:ON745804/ON745802/ON745803), two samples from the Gilliam group (XYP50/59, accession numbers:ON745800/ON745801), and one sample from the TA763 group (XYP41, accession number:ON745805). Phylogenetic analysis classified the samples into Karp‐like, Kato‐like, Gilliam, and TA763 groups. The Karp‐like genotype were predominant among both patients and rodents in Xiangyun County (Figure2).

Squares indicate animal samples, while circles indicate patient samples. The phylogenetic tree, constructed using MEGA‐X with 1000 bootstrap replications and the neighbour‐joining method, shows nucleotide substitution at each site. A bootstrap value greater than 70% is considered a reliable evolutionary branch.

In our study, the majority of sequences were closely related to the Karp‐like genotype, with similarities ranging from 91.90% to 98.13% among themselves and 90.92% to 100% compared to other Karp‐like genotype. Additionally, three samples (4.69%) (XYP54, XYP15, XYP40) were identified as Kato‐like genotype, exhibiting similarities of 85.71%–99.56%. These Kato‐like genotype were generally most similar to strains from Taiwan, China and formed three distinct branches. Furthermore, two samples (3.13%) from patients (XYP50, XYP59) and one from rodents yielded Gilliam amplicons, showing sequence similarities of 92.93%–99.50% with the HL1004b strain from Taiwan, China and FPW2049 from Thailand. One sample from the TA763 group (XYP41) also showed a high identity of 97.73% to the Taitung‐4 strain from Taiwan, China. Interestingly, the majority of sequences from both rodents and humans clustered within the Karp‐like branches, with nucleotide similarities ranging from 88.45% to 99.37% (TableS3). Notably, comparative analysis of clinical manifestations among the four genotypes revealed that fever was a consistent feature in all cases. However, patients infected with the Karp‐like genotype seem to exhibit significantly more severe clinical symptoms, such as hepatic dysfunction and respiratory failure, compared to those infected with other genotype (TableS4).

To explore the genetic diversity ofOT, we conducted recombination analysis using ORF sequences. We analyzed 21 samples (TableS5), which included 12 representative proto‐genotype strains from GenBank and nine samples representing the Karp, Kato, Gilliam, and TA763 genotypes in our study. Our multi‐genotype recombination analysis revealed recombination events between both identical and different genotypes, including those represented in our sequenced data (Figure3). Notably, cross‐genotype overlapping events were observed in various regions of the ORF, involving Karp and Kato/TA763/Gilliam genotypes (Figure3A,D). In particular, we identified a sequence in XYP54 with partial identity to multiple strains from different genotypes, indicating several recombination events (Figure3B,C). Additional recombination events were also detected in other sample sequences (Figure3C). These findings suggest that the genetic diversity ofOTis likely driven by frequent point mutations and genetic recombination among different genotypes.

The diagram illustrates the putative primary and secondary parent sequences (color‐coded) and the predicted breakpoints for each genotype. Recombination events are demonstrated using Simplot and Bootscan plots for each sample.

Yunnan Province, situated in southwest China, has garnered significant scientific interest due to its complex terrain, unique altitude gradient, and high biodiversity. Notably, this region is home to five of the six primary vectors of scrub typhus in China (Peng et al.2016). Factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and adequate precipitation contribute to an elevated risk of scrub typhus in this area. The study demonstrates thatOTgenotypes in Xiangyun County exhibit high genetic diversity and wide‐spread geographical distribution.

Our findings indicate that 72.41% of scrub typhus patients exhibited eschar, a hallmark clinical sign of the disease that aids in identifying suspected cases (Perumalla et al.2019). Lymphadenopathy, a common manifestation of scrub typhus (Liu et al.2007), was also prevalent. Previous studies have noted a higher incidence of lymphadenopathy in scrub typhus patients compared to those with other conditions (Su et al.2016). Importantly, our study identified 15 scrub typhus patients (3.98%) as young children. This highlights a significant risk forOTinfection in this vulnerable group, whose weakened immune systems can lead to severe outcomes if the disease goes undiagnosed. Evidence suggests that children with scrub typhus are at increased risk for meningoencephalitis, which can result in severe neurological complications or death (Rose et al.2017; Wangrangsimakul et al.2020). The virulence of distinct serotypes is influenced by multiple determinants, including the immunological profile of the local population and the specific species of chigger mites involved. Consequently, establishing a definitive virulence hierarchy among serotypes remains challenging (D. M. Kim et al.2006; Vallee et al.2010).

Early detection of scrub typhus, particularly in regions with limited medical resources, is crucial for protecting children in endemic areas (Damodar et al.2023). Strengthening surveillance and increasing awareness of scrub typhus among high‐risk populations, especially children in warm and humid regions with extensive farmland and grassland coverage in Yunnan Province, are essential for mitigating the impact of this disease.

Before 1985, scrub typhus was endemic only in regions south of the 31°N latitude in China. However, since 1986, new natural foci ofOThave been identified north of the Yangtze River. In China, the primaryOTgenotypes are Gilliam, Karp, and Kato. Gilliam is more commonly found in areas north of the Yangtze River, whereas Karp predominates in southern China (Xiangrui et al.1991). Yunnan Province, in particular, has the highest annual prevalence of scrub typhus in China, with Karp being the most common genotype, followed by Gilliam (Yao et al.2019). Despite its significant impact, scrub typhus remains a neglected disease in Yunnan Province, partly due to a lack of genotyping data and inadequate national surveillance systems (Paris et al.2013; L. J. Zhang et al.2007). We identified theOTgenotypes in Xiangyun County, a known endemic area in Yunnan Province, by analyzing the variable regions and complete sequences of the 56‐kDa antigen gene. In this study, four genotypes were found to reflect the diversity ofOTgenotypes among the patients and infected small mammals, and the dominant genotypes of scrub typhus are considered Karp‐like. Notably, the TA763 sequence identified demonstrates remarkable similarity to sequences previously reported in Taiwan of China, which can be considered thatOTmay have migrated over long distances. Different genotypes ofOThave a tendency to spread within ‘tsutsugamushi triangle’ (Richards and Jiang2020). These findings underscore the significance of 56 kDa gene sequence analysis in establishing epidemiological connections for cross‐border emerging infectious diseases.

Our study revealed multiple intra‐gene recombination events, indicating that genetic diversity may contribute to the rising incidence of scrub typhus. The presence of the 56‐kDa TSA in geographically distant locations, such as Taiwan of China, suggests potential transmission and spread of scrub typhus genotypes across regions. The classification ofOTgenotypes has been primarily on the sequence variation of the 56‐kDa TSA. This gene is unique toOT, and its high variability in amino‐acid content stems from the presence of multiple variable domains. The extracellular domain of the 56‐kDa TSA protein encompasses highly variable regions, along with numerous antigenic domains (Banerjee and Kulkarni2021). Therefore, intragenic recombination, which is commonly observed among diverse genotype sequences, can cause significant alterations in both genetic variation and antigenicity. Consistent with these facts, a study utilizing a variety of informatics tools reported similar outcomes (G. Kim et al.2017). The study revealed multiple intragenic recombination events and a considerably higher mutation rate compared to other house‐keeping genes. These findings suggest that genetic diversification inOTtakes place through frequent point mutations and subsequent genetic recombination.

As with the majority of studies, the design of the current study is subject to limitations. The patient information collected in this study was derived from a retrospective design, which may introduce recall bias. Additionally, due to time and geographical limitations, the sample size of infected small mammals collected was relatively small, potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, rigorous quality control measures were implemented throughout the study, including double‐entry verification of patient data. Despite the limited sample size of infected small mammals, the samples were representative of the endemic areas in Xiangyun County. These findings offer valuable insights into the prevalence and diagnostic aspects of Tsutsugamushi disease.

In conclusion, we identified the predominant genotypes and clinical characteristics of scrub typhus in Xiangyun County, Yunnan Province. Karp‐like genotype were the most common, followed by Kato‐like, Gilliam, and TA763 genotype. The observed antigen diversity has significant implications for vaccine development. Additionally, our study assessed the role of rodents as potential reservoirs ofOTand explored the relationship betweenOTand human disease. Further research is needed to refine serological diagnostics and isolate specific strains. Understanding the local antigen diversity is essential for developing region‐specific vaccines and diagnostic tools.
