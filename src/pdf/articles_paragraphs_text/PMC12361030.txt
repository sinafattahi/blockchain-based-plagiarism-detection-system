Following publication of the original article (Guo et al.2020), the authors found two inadvertent errors in Fig.5b and Fig. S2D. In Fig. 5b, Fig. 6a was mistakenly duplicated during the figure assembly process, and in Fig. S2D, MDCK parental cell AYM data (from Fig. S2B) were incorrectly used as HepaRG parental cell AYM data during plotting. The authors have revisited the original data and have prepared revised versions of Fig.5and Fig. S2. It should be noted that in Fig. S2D, due to differences between the current GraphPad software version (GraphPad Prism 10) and the previously used version, the horizontal positions of some scatter points within the 380 Pa, 3.5 kPa, 40 kPa, and coverslip substrate stiffness groups exhibit slight positional variations, while the vertical axis distribution (cell AYM) remains consistent with that of the previous version. The errors were entirely unintentional and do not affect the corresponding conclusion of the study, the authors sincerely apologize and hope a smooth corrigendum to ensure its rigor.

The original article (Guo et al.2020) has been corrected.
