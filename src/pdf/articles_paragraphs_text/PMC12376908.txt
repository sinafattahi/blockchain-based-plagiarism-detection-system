This study successfully developed synthetic pathways for novel pyrimidine-based compounds for their potential anti-diabetic α-amylase inhibitory activity, aiming at potential antidiabetic applications. Molecular docking techniques showed that compounds 1, 6, and 8 showed the highest molecular dockingin silicobinding affinity, followed byin vitroestimation. Compound 1 showed the strongest inhibitoryin vitroamylase effect, in comparison to the reference drug acarbose. According toin silicoandin vitrocombination, a novel radiolabeled compound,131Iodine-Compound 1, was chosen for further labeling study. The radiolabeling factors, including ligand concentration, pH, and reaction time, were adjusted to achieve maximum radiochemical yield and stability. For thein vivobehavior, biodistribution studies were estimated in mice up to a 36 hours period. The labelled compound showed significant and prolonged accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach and intestine, consistent with its proposed mechanism of enzyme inhibition. A gradual increase in muscle uptake was observed, raising possible insights into side effects reported with similar drugs. These results suggest that compound 1 not only possesses potent amylase-blocking and related effective antidiabetic activity but also holds promise as a molecular probe for molecular dynamic imaging for the GIT system.

An131I-labeled α-amylase inhibitor shows exceptional stomach retention (59.6% ID per g) and sustained intestinal uptake, highlighting its promise as a GI-targeted antidiabetic agent and potential GI imaging probe.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is recognized as one of the most significant global public health challenges. It is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.1,2There are two main types: Type I diabetes, in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, and Type II diabetes, where the body becomes resistant to insulin or fails to use it effectively. Although insulin is often still produced in type II cases, its proper utilization is impaired. The variability in insulin response remains an open research question, but contributing factors include obesity, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition. Type II DM is associated with several comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, increasing the risk of both acute and chronic complications, including premature mortality.3While lifestyle modifications and weight loss are essential for disease control, maintaining these changes long-term is challenging, and the risk of diabetes may persist even after successful weight management.4,5One therapeutic strategy for DM management involves inhibiting the enzyme α-amylase, which is responsible for catalyzing the breakdown of starch into glucose. Effective α-amylase inhibitors must possess suitable structural features to bind to the enzyme's active site and suppress its catalytic function. Several antidiabetic medications such as metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin, and GLP-1 analogs are widely used, yet most are associated with side effects and fail to achieve optimal glycemic control in many patients.6Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing new antidiabetic agents with improved safety and efficacy profiles. Heterocyclic pyrimidine derivatives have shown promise as bioactive scaffolds due to their diverse biological properties.7–12Pyrimidine rings, being fundamental components of nucleic acids, hold particular importance in medicinal chemistry, and several pyrimidine-based compounds have been investigated as potential enzyme inhibitors for diabetes treatment.

Molecular docking andin silicomodeling can help elucidate the mechanism of action of novel pyrimidine derivatives by predicting their binding interactions with target proteins. Previous studies13–19have employed molecular docking to examine protein-ligand interactions at the atomic level, aiding in the rational design of drug candidates. In this study, synthesized pyrimidine-based compounds were docked against the α-amylase active site (PDB ID: 5E0F)20aiming to identify promising inhibitors.

To further support the biological relevance of the most active compound, a novel radiolabeled derivative (131I-pyrimidine) was synthesized. Key radiolabeling parameters, including ligand concentration, pH, reaction temperature, and incubation time, were optimized to ensure high radiochemical yield andin vitrostability.In vitroα-amylase inhibition assays were conducted to evaluate antidiabetic potential, whilein vivobiodistribution studies in normal mice were carried out to investigate tissue uptake, pharmacokinetics, and gastrointestinal targeting of the radiolabeled compound.21–26This integrative study combining synthetic chemistry, computational modeling, biological assays, and radiotracing techniques aims to identify and characterize novel pyrimidine-based α-amylase inhibitors with potential dual roles as therapeutic agents and diagnostic imaging probes for diabetes management.

1,1′-(5,8-Dihydroxy-2-oxo-6a-phenyl-2,3,3a1,6a-tetrahydro-1H-perimidine-6,7-diyl)bis(ethan-1-one), a novel perimidine derivative, was successfully synthesized in this study using a one-pot multicomponent reaction that involved 5-benzylidene barbituric acid, acetylacetone, and TiO2nanoparticles as a nanocatalyst under reflux in dimethylformamide (DMF). The final polyfunctionalized heterocyclic scaffold is the result of a sequential Michael addition, intramolecular cyclization, and 1,3-sigmatropic rearrangement, as shown in the suggested scheme. Because of the nanomaterial's high catalytic effectiveness and increased surface area, which facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups and promote the synthesis of intermediates, the introduction of TiO2nanoparticles greatly raised the reaction yield (98%) and decreased the reaction time,Scheme 1. Several spectroscopic methods were used to validate the synthesized compound's structure. The O–H and N–H stretching vibrations are represented by the distinctive absorption bands in the infrared spectra, which were found at 3492 cm−1and 3190 cm−1, respectively. While the peaks at 1561 and 1492 cm−1verify the presence of aromatic CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C bonds, the strong bands at 1752 cm−1and 1679 cm−1are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated carbonyl (CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O) and imine (CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019N) functionalities. Acetyl methyl and methine groups were detected by the1H NMR spectra (DMSO-d6), which showed singlets atδ= 2.06 ppm (6H, CH3) andδ= 2.88 ppm (1H, methine proton). The aromatic protons resonated as a multiplet in the range ofδ= 7.11–7.35 ppm (5H), whereas the olefinic protons showed up as singlets atδ= 6.89 ppm (2H). Downfield signals atδ= 8.70–8.77 ppm (2H, NH) andδ= 11.67–11.78 ppm (2H, OH) verified that the heterocyclic ring included hydrogen-bonded protons. Additionally, signals corresponding to methyl (δ= 34.44, 36.62), methine (δ= 50.16), aromatic/olefinic carbons (δ= 109.00–143.11), imine, and carbonyl carbons (δ= 148.82–172.36) were found in the13C NMR spectra, which confirmed the given structure. The ESI+mass spectrum's molecular ion peak, which is detected atm/z= 378.33 (M+), validates the target compound's effective synthesis by confirming the product's molecular weight.

Using 5-benzylidene barbituric acid as the primary substrate, a number of pyrimidine derivatives were effectively produced by multicomponent reactions that were TiO2nanocatalyzed. Target compounds (2–5) are produced under moderate circumstances utilizing TiO2nanoparticles (1.5 mg) as an effective and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst in DMF at reflux for 6 hours, as shown in the schematic approach 2. Because of their large surface area, Lewis acidity, and superior dispersion in polar fluids, TiO2nanoparticles were essential in increasing reaction speeds and yields (96–98.6%). Through the processes of Knoevenagel condensation, Michael addition, and intramolecular cyclization, these properties promoted the creation of pyrimido[4,5,6-ij][2,7]naphthyridine and perimidine frameworks by effectively activating carbonyl and nitrile groups. The presence of multiple carbonyl functionalities was confirmed by the characteristic IR absorption bands for NH (3112 cm−1), aliphatic/aromatic C–H (3057–2837 cm−1), and strong carbonyl stretches (1752, 1702, 1679 cm−1) displayed by compound 2, diethyl 2,5,8-trioxo-6a-phenyl-2,3,4,5,6,6a,7,8-octahydro-1H-perimidine-6,7-dicarboxylate. Ethyl groups were represented as triplets and quartets in the1H NMR spectrum atδ1.05–2.50 ppm, while aromatic protons were seen as a multiplet atδ7.13–7.32 ppm. NH groups were detected in two singlets atδ11.46 ppm. The structure was further validated by13C NMR, which showed distinctive signals for aliphatic, aromatic, and carbonyl (δ∼172–209 ppm) carbons. 8-Hydroxy-2,5-dioxo-6a-phenyl-2,3,4,5,6,6a-hexahydro-1H-pyrimido [4,5,6-ij] is compound 3. The stretching vibrations of hydroxyl (3473 cm−1), NH (3219–3317 cm−1), aromatic/aliphatic C–H (3054–2929 cm−1), and nitrile (2200 cm−1) were clearly visible in [2,7]naphthyridine-6,7-dicarbonitrile. The cyclization and nitrile substitution were verified by the IR and NMR. A tricyclic naphthyridine system was supported by the1H NMR spectra, which revealed a downfield singlet for OH atδ13.34 ppm and extra NH protons atδ9.14 and 10.85 ppm. The effective insertion of amide functionalities was demonstrated by Compound 4, a dihydroxy-dicarboxamide derivative, which showed IR absorptions for OH (3473 cm−1), NH and NH2groups (3351, 3159 cm−1), and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O (1615 cm−1). In addition to aromatic protons, the1H NMR verified this with singlets atδ7.18 ppm for NH2andδ11.53 ppm for hydroxyl groups. The high yield (96%) and melting point provided additional evidence of the nanocatalyst's effectiveness in creating highly functionalized heterocycles. In addition to a prominent nitrile band at 2221 cm−1and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O at 1677 cm−1, compound 5, the diamino-dicyano derivative, showed IR bands for NH and NH2at 3383 and 3281–3132 cm−1. NH atδ9.98 ppm, aromatic multiplet atδ7.43–7.51 ppm, and NH2protons atδ6.50 ppm were all visible in the1H NMR spectrum. Signals for nitrile, carbonyl, and aromatic carbons were detected by13C NMR. The estimated molecular ion peak and the mass spectrum (m/z= 346.81) agreed, indicating molecular integrity (Scheme 2).

Using 5-benzylidene barbituric acid as a crucial intermediate and a variety of nucleophilic partners, including dimedone, cyclopentanone, urea, and hydrazine hydrate, a multicomponent reaction was used to create a number of new fused heterocyclic systems (compounds 6–9). TiO2nanoparticles (1.5 mg) were used as an effective nanocatalyst. For six hours, reactions were conducted in DMF under reflux conditions. Because of their large surface area and improved catalytic qualities, which allow for efficient interaction with reactants and facilitate bond formationviaKnoevenagel–Michael-type sequences and intramolecular cyclizations, TiO2NPs greatly increased yield (96.8–98.9%) and decreased reaction time. IR revealed a wide NH band at 3152 cm−1and significant CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O absorptions at 1761 and 1678 cm−1for compound 6, which was created by interaction with dimedone. In addition to a singlet for NH at 9.89 ppm, the1H NMR spectra verified the existence of four methyl groups (δ= 0.88 ppm, 12H), methylene protons (δ= 2.05, 2.23 ppm), and aromatic protons (δ= 7.15–7.22 ppm). A molecular ion peak atm/z458.61 was visible in the MS spectra, which was in line with the predicted mass. The IR bands for NH (3191 cm−1), aromatic/aliphatic C–H (3022–2957 cm−1), and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O (1683 cm−1) were seen in compound 7, which was created using cyclopentanone. The cyclopentyl CH2protons (δ= 2.67–3.50 ppm) were found to have complex multiplets in1H NMR, coupled with aromatic protons and a downfield NH signal at 11.45 ppm. The aliphatic CH2, quaternary carbons, and carbonyl groups were represented by peaks in the13C NMR spectra, which supported the production of a fused dicyclopenta[a,j]phenalene skeleton. In the IR spectra, compound 8, which was the result of a reaction with urea, had a high NH absorption at 3398 cm−1and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O at 1614 cm−1. Multiple NH protons in a polyazaphenalene framework were indicated by the distinctive NH signals atδ= 9.14, 9.38, and 10.60 ppm in the1H NMR spectra. The appearance of aromatic protons occurred aroundδ= 7.96–8.07 ppm. The hexacyclic trione structure was supported by the13C NMR spectra, which verified the existence of carbonyl carbons, heteroaromatic rings, and sp2carbons. In the infrared spectra, compound 9, which was made using hydrazine, displayed a CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O band at 1646 cm−1and a single NH stretch at 3160 cm−1. Aromatic protons atδ= 7.15 ppm and a singlet NH at 8.71 ppm were detected by the1H NMR. The development of a hexaazacyclopenta[cd]indene framework was confirmed by the carbon spectra, which showed peaks atδ= 89.15 and 102.10 ppm that corresponded to freshly produced heterocyclic carbons together with aromatic and carbonyl carbon signals (Scheme 3).

All 7 targets associated with anti-diabetic illness were docked separately with each medication. These compounds have extraordinarily high binding affinities for all 7 anti-diabetic targets compared to the docked ligand [Acarbose and Evogliptin] as a reference for anti-diabetic evaluation using human pancreatic alpha-amylase in complex with mini-montbretin A (PDB ID: 5E0F). Two commercial drugs [Acarbose and Evogliptin] are powerful anti-diabetic drugs that inhibit 5E0F, as shown inTable 1. Acarbose binds in a pocket dummy atom binding site, interacting with ASP 300 (A) and GLU 233 (A) with 3 hydrogen bonds and also establishing a pi-H with 5-ring TRP 59 (A), 6-ring TYR 62 (A), and 5-ring HIS 101 (A). While Evogliptin binds in a pocket dummy atom binding site, interacting with TYR 62 with pi-H.Fig. 2depicts Acarbose and Evogliptin's binding location to 5E0F in 2D and 3D. All compounds, especially 1, 6, and 8, bind to the human pancreatic alpha-amylase in complex with mini-montbretin A (PDB ID: 5E0F) active site similarly to the native ligand, as shown inTable 1. As depicted inTable 1, target 1 was bound to the active site with docked scores of −6.047 (kcal mol−1). Whereas compound 6 exhibited the highest docking score of −6.6096 (kcal mol−1). Their re-docking poses were illustrated inFig. 3.

To validate the docking protocol, a redocking study was performed using the native ligand (5J7) present in the crystal structure of human pancreatic α-amylase (PDB ID: 5E0F). The ligand was extracted and re-docked into the active site under the same docking conditions used for the test compounds. The obtained RMSD value for the native ligand was 1.966 Å, which is within the generally accepted threshold of ≤ 2 Å, confirming the reliability of the docking parameters.

Further validation was performed by docking two commercially available and well-characterized α-amylase inhibitors, Acarbose and Evogliptin. These inhibitors were docked under identical conditions, and their binding scores (−8.399 kcal mol−1and −6.450 kcal mol−1, respectively), RMSD values (1.470 Å and 1.603 Å, respectively), and interaction profiles with key catalytic residues (Asp300, Glu233, Tyr62, Trp59, His101) were compared with those of the synthesized compounds. Several synthesized compounds, particularly compounds 1, 6, and 8, exhibited comparable or favorable binding affinities and similar binding modes to the reference ligands, interacting with the same critical residues in the active site (Table 3).

These validation steps redocking of the native ligand and comparison with known inhibitors confirm that the docking protocol is robust and thein silicoresults are credible.

To enhance the radiolabeling efficiency of 131-iodocomp 1, the experimental conditions were systematically adjusted, including the concentrations of comp 1 and CH-T, as well as the pH, reaction duration, and temperature (Fig. 4). The highest radiochemical yield (RCY) achieved was 94.3 ± 1.1%, as measured by paper chromatography. This optimal result was obtained when the reaction used 200 μg ml−1of comp. 1 and 100 μg of ChT, conducted at pH 4 for 30 minutes at room temperature (25 °C),Fig. 4.

The α-amylase inhibition activity was estimated for compounds 1, 6, and 8, with acarbose as the standard. InFig. 5, all tested compounds showed inhibitory potential to different degrees. Compound 1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity, with an IC50of 34.60 ± 1.43 μg ml−1. This result agrees with the compound's structural characteristics, forming favorable binding site activity of α-amylase, as thein silicofindings show.

Thein vivobehavior of the highest amylase inhibitor compound 1 was studied using [131I]-labeled mice. Radioactivity levels were measured in major organs at different time points (1 to 36 hours post-injection), and results were expressed as % injected dose per gram of tissue,Fig. 6. Following administration, a marked initial accumulation was seen in the stomach (59.58% ID per g) and intestine (11.70% ID per g) at the 1 hour post-injection. Gastric levels decreased slowly, while intestinal uptake increased, reaching a maximum at 16 hours (34.93% ID per g). This distribution profile is indicative of gastrointestinal slow release, which is potentially attributed to the compound's α-amylase affinity and possibly species differences in gastric retention in mice. These findings are comparable with compounds that block carbohydrate digestion enzymes, such as acarbose, and may indicate slow intestinal clearance (enterohepatic circulation) or mucosal interaction.52The stable blood levels from 12.13% ID per g at 1 hour to 8.72% ID per g at 36 hours indicate evidence of low systemic clearance, possibly enhancing the compound's availability for therapeutic action through re-excretion to the intestine. There was a continuous increase in muscle uptake with time, reaching 20.15% ID per g at 36 hours, indicating progressive peripheral uptake. This muscle uptake retention highlights a potential link to muscle-related side effects (e.g., weakness, fatigue) reported with acarbose, though the mechanism is unclear. It is possible that amylase-binding-related compounds like this may be retained in muscle tissue, either through passive diffusion or transport mechanisms related to glucose metabolism or unknown mechanisms.53Liver uptake reaches maximum at 8 hours, indicating early hepatic metabolism. This uptake is similar for compounds showing phase I/II metabolism. Kidney uptake increased continuously, indicating some renal clearance as a possible primary elimination route. The slow increase in thyroid uptake (2.38% ID per g at 36 h), bone, and spleen radioactivity may highlightin vivodeiodination, a known equilibrium of radioiodinated tracers, leading to radio uptake of free [131I] in iodine-avid tissues. Such deiodination limits imaging specificity but could be minimized by modifying the compound to resist enzymatic degradation or by using alternative radionuclides with greaterin vivostability.54Accordingly, Compound 1 demonstrated the highest α-amylase inhibitionin vitroand a favorable biodistribution profile, particularly with regard to prolonged intestinal residence. The slow gastric clearance and prominent intestinal and muscle uptake highlight its potential as a gastrointestinal-targeted antidiabetic agent, as well as a radiotracer for GI imaging probes. The continuous muscle accumulation observed may give a new glimpse of the muscle-related side effects that were found with amylase inhibitors. Further studies are needed to find out the mechanisms attributed to side effects and to explore the clinical perspective of this compound as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent.

Thein vivobiodistribution profile of131I–Compound 1 demonstrated marked gastrointestinal (GIT) specificity and stability when compared with control data. Free131I is known to accumulate predominantly in the thyroid due to iodide trapping; however,131I–Compound 1 exhibited minimal thyroid uptake (<3% ID per g), confirmingin vivostability and reduced deiodination.55Notably, stomach retention was significantly higher (59.58 ± 3.2% ID per g at 1 h) than literature-reported values for the α-amylase inhibitor acarbose (∼15% ID per g at 4 h).52Sustained intestinal accumulation (34.93% ID per g at 16 h) was approximately threefold greater than in muscle, indicating selective GIT targeting. This slow intestinal clearance aligns with prolonged luminal α-amylase inhibition, which is advantageous for maintaining therapeutic concentrations at the primary enzymatic site while minimizing systemic exposure.

The pronounced accumulation of the radiolabeled pyrimidine derivative in the stomach (59.58% ID per g) and intestine (34.93% ID per g) is consistent with the luminal localization of α-amylase, a digestive enzyme predominantly secreted into the gastrointestinal tract.21This preferential uptake suggests that the compound can achieve high local concentrations at the primary site of enzymatic activity, potentially enhancing inhibitory efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure. Such targeted distribution supports its theranostic potential, enabling simultaneous enzyme inhibition and imaging within the gastrointestinal environment.

The findings of this study demonstrate the successful development of a pyrimidine-based compound with dual therapeutic and diagnostic potential for diabetes management. Several synthesized derivatives exhibited strongin silicobinding affinities toward α-amylase, with compound 1 emerging as the most promising candidate. Guided by molecular docking andin vitroenzyme inhibition assays, compound 1 was radiolabeled with iodine-131, and key parameters, including ligand concentration, pH, and reaction time, were optimized to achieve high radiochemical yield and stability. Notably, compound 1 displayed both potent α-amylase inhibitory activity and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Its high accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract underscores its potential role in regulating postprandial glucose levels. Moreover, its gradual uptake in muscle tissue suggests possible systemic effects that may provide insight into muscle-related outcomes associated with α-amylase inhibitors. The compound's stable radiolabeling and prolonged tissue retention further support its utility as a potential molecular imaging agent for gastrointestinal applications, alongside its therapeutic promise. Nevertheless, additional studies are warranted to refine its molecular structure, improve specificity, and minimize off-target distribution.
