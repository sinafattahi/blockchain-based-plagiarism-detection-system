PseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis is a relatively rare disease, and it is very easy for clinicians to misdiagnose. It is particularly necessary for the patient presenting with recurrent pyrexia and hemoptysis in the absence of clear‐cut pulmonary radiological findings to receive a bronchoscopy.

InvasiveAspergillustracheobronchitis represents an uncommon manifestation ofAspergillusinfection, localized predominantly to the tracheobronchial tree with significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges [1]. Unlike classical invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which primarily affects the lung parenchyma in profoundly immunocompromised hosts, invasiveAspergillustracheobronchitis—particularly its pseudomembranous variant—occurs sporadically and often evades timely diagnosis due to nonspecific symptoms and absence of characteristic radiological findings. This entity manifests histopathologically as fungal hyphal invasion beneath a necroinflammatory pseudomembrane, frequently complicating conditions, such as prolonged corticosteroid use, hematologic malignancies, or solid organ transplantation [2,3]. Notably, emerging evidence suggests invasiveAspergillustracheobronchitis may also afflict patients with milder immune perturbations, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, or viral respiratory infections [4]. Despite advances in antifungal therapies, pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis remains prone to misdiagnosis as endobronchial tuberculosis or bacterial bronchitis, often delaying appropriate intervention. Bronchoscopy with histopathological confirmation thus constitutes a critical diagnostic tool in such scenarios. Herein, we present a case of pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis in a diabetic COPD patient with influenza coinfection, highlighting the pivotal role of bronchoscopic evaluation in atypical presentations of recurrent fever and hemoptysis [5].

A 63‐year‐old male was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a week of recurrent pyrexia and minimal hemoptysis. The patient had a documented history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was receiving long‐term treatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol. The patient has previously suffered from type 2 diabetes and has long‐term oral administration of metformin tablets (500 mg twice daily). However, glycemic control remained suboptimal during the week preceding admission, with blood glucose levels fluctuating between 9.1 and 22.6 mmol/L.

Upon admission, laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with a count of 12.4 × 109/L, neutrophilia at 9.6 × 109/L, and a hemoglobin level of 117 g/L. The highly sensitive C‐reactive protein level was notably elevated at 182 mg/L. Thoracic computed tomography showed findings consistent with pulmonary emphysema and bullae. Additionally, the patient displayed febrile symptoms, and a pharyngeal swab tested positive for influenza A nucleic acids. Upon hospital admission, the patient's blood glucose was 21.9 mmol/L. Subsequent in‐hospital monitoring revealed fluctuations ranging from 10.2 to 25.8 mmol/L. The patient's glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value is 9.8%. Consequently, oral metformin therapy was discontinued, and intensified subcutaneous insulin therapy was initiated with the following regimen: regular human insulin (4 units before breakfast, 6 units before lunch, 6 units before dinner) and neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (6 units at bedtime). The initial diagnoses included an acute exacerbation of COPD and influenza A infection. Despite the administration of intravenous ceftriaxone (2000 mg once daily for 6 days) for the patient's continued pyrexia and production of yellow, purulent sputum, along with the initiation of antiviral therapy using oseltamivir phosphate capsules (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) and hemostatic intervention with intravenous tranexamic acid (1000 mg once daily for 5 days), the patient continued to experience persistent minor hemoptysis. Subsequently, bronchoscopy was performed, revealing the presence of a yellow–white pseudomembrane on the tracheal and bronchial surfaces, which appeared friable and bled upon contact (Figure1A–E). Tracheal lavage and mucosal biopsy of the tracheal lesions were then carried out. Examination of the lavage fluid at high magnification identified fungal spores andAspergillushyphae (Figure2). Furthermore, histopathological analysis of the tracheal mucosal biopsy confirmed the presence ofAspergillushyphae (Figure3). The patient was finally diagnosed with pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis. During the hospitalization, intravenous voriconazole therapy was initiated with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 h on day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg twice daily. Concomitantly, inhaled voriconazole (40 mg once daily for 7 days) was administered. Following treatment, the patient became afebrile and hemoptysis markedly reduced.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis stands out as the most prevalent fungal infection affecting the lungs in immunocompromised individuals, typically centered on the lung parenchyma, while tracheal and bronchial involvement remains an infrequent occurrence. Specifically,Aspergillustracheobronchitis denotes anAspergillusinfection localized within the trachea and bronchi, presenting as a rare subset of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [6].

In this case, the patient was diagnosed with pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis mainly relying on the presence ofAspergillushyphae by mucosal biopsy and yellow–white pseudomembrane on the tracheal and bronchial surfaces by bronchoscopy. PseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis is a type of tracheobronchial aspergillosis. PseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis is relatively rare, which makes it easy for doctors to misdiagnose as endobronchial tuberculosis. Therefore, we wish to raise clinicians' awareness by reporting this case. Tracheobronchial aspergillosis is presently classified into three distinct clinical patterns: obstructive tracheobronchitis, characterized by thick secretions and mycelial masses with minimalAspergillusmucosal infiltration; ulcerative tracheobronchitis, where fungal hyphae aggressively invade the tracheobronchial mucosa, resulting in ulcerative lesions; and pseudomembranous or necrotizing tracheobronchitis, characterized by a pseudomembrane composed ofAspergillushyphae and necrotic debris [7,8].

PseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis commonly afflicts patients with compromised immune function, including those undergoing prolonged corticosteroid therapy, organ transplant recipients, individuals with malignancies, AIDS patients, or those experiencing malnutrition post‐major surgery. Nonetheless, instances also sporadically manifest in patients with mild immunosuppression stemming from conditions like diabetes and COPD [2,9,10]. Furthermore, the patient was diagnosed with influenza A after admission. Studies have shown that influenza has emerged as an independent risk factor for invasive aspergillosis. Recent investigations have underscored the pivotal role of airway epithelium damage and disruption of the tracheal epithelial barrier in the development of invasiveAspergillustracheobronchitis among influenza patients [11]. Additionally, the influenza virus may disrupt host immune regulation by impeding the NADP oxidase (NOX) complex, thereby compromising tracheal defenses againstAspergillus[12]. In the context of this case involving a patient with type 2 diabetes, susceptibility toAspergillusin diabetic individuals may be linked to intra‐ and extracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies have indicated that heightened intracellular ROS levels correlate closely with neutrophil and lung tissue damage, while reduced extracellular ROS levels diminish the bactericidal capacity of neutrophils [13]. Moreover, hyperglycemia could impede the expression of HIF‐1α, an anti‐inflammatory hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α, thereby disrupting the NLRP3/IL‐1β signaling pathway and influencing T lymphocyte differentiation, thereby compromising the body's anti‐inflammatory response againstAspergillus[14]. The patient's blood sugar was not well controlled and was always in a state of high blood sugar before admission. Therefore, the recent hyperglycemia may also be an important factor leading to his pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis.

Regarding therapeutic strategies, voriconazole stands as the principal antifungal agent for managingAspergillustracheobronchitis. In this case, the patient began the treatment of voriconazole after diagnosis of pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis, and the trachea and bronchial recovered significantly after 2 months of treatment. This shows the importance of voriconazole in the first‐line treatment of pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis. However, there is currently no standardized therapeutic protocol for pseudomembranous Aspergillus tracheobronchitis. In clinical practice, most pseudomembranous Aspergillus tracheobronchitis cases are empirically managed according to treatment guidelines for IPA. Voriconazole dosing and treatment duration similarly align with IPA therapeutic standards [15,16,17,18]. In cases where voriconazole is contraindicated, alternatives such as liposomal amphotericin B and other triazole antifungals can be considered [19]. Noteworthy expert opinions suggest that intratracheal administration of voriconazole may yield beneficial effects in managingAspergillustracheobronchitis in patients unable to receive intravenous formulations [7,19,20].

In conclusion, given the elusive nature of pseudomembranousAspergillustracheobronchitis in diagnosis, maintaining a vigilant bronchoscopic approach becomes paramount. This becomes especially crucial in patients presenting with recurrent pyrexia and hemoptysis in the absence of clear‐cut pulmonary radiological findings, necessitating heightened surveillance for potential tracheobronchial abnormalities. Currently, the preferred therapeutic approach forAspergillustracheobronchitis involves the use of voriconazole, administered either intravenously or orally. Additionally, the potential benefits of intratracheal voriconazole instillation in managingAspergillustracheobronchitis warrant consideration.
