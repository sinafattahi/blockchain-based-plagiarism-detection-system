The factors associated with extrahepatic recurrence (EHR) after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have rarely been investigated. This study examined the pre- and postoperative predictors of EHR after curative resection in HCC patients over a ten-year follow-up period.

A retrospective review was conducted on treatment-naïve HCC patients who underwent curative resection between 2004 and 2019 at four tertiary hospitals in South Korea. The cohort of 1,069 patients was divided into a derivation cohort (n= 683) and a validation cohort (n= 386) based on participating institutions.

In the derivation cohort, the mean age was 59.8 years, and 85.7% were male. The majority of patients (98.7%) had compensated liver cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis B was the prevalent etiology (72.9%). EHR developed in 107 patients (15.7%) and was associated with younger age, advanced tumor stages, and histological features including larger tumor size, a higher number of tumors, the presence of microvascular invasion, serosal nvasion, intrahepatic metastasis, and necrosis. According to multivariable Cox regression analyses, younger age, a higher modified Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage, exceeding the Milan criteria, and an albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade ≥ 2 were independently significant preoperative factors associated with EHR. Similarly, age, tumor number, the presence of microvascular invasion, necrosis, exceeding the Milan criteria, and an ALBI grade ≥ 2 were independently significant postoperative factors. Kaplan–Meier plots clearly differentiated EHR-free survival among the risk groups stratified by our EHR-preop and EHR-postop models. The EHR-preop and EHR-postop models, developed in the derivation cohort, were applied to the validation cohort and showed clear separation among risk groups.

Our study developed and validated predictive models (EHR-preop and EHR-postop) to identify the risk of EHR after curative HCC resection. The models could potentially enhance clinical decision-making by identifying patients at elevated EHR risk thus advancing personalized HCC care.

Studies on the factors associated with extrahepatic recurrence (EHR) following curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been limited. We have identified significant predictors and developed predictive models using a derivation cohort. These models were subsequently validated in an independent cohort, enabling the identification of patients at increased risk of EHR and calculation of the probability of EHR before and after resection. This novel tool offers clinicians a way to enhance decision-making and tailor personalized care for HCC patients.

Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the sixth most prevalent form of cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality [1]. In 2020, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was responsible for more than 900,000 new diagnoses. Future projections suggest that annual mortality rates attributed to HCC could exceed 1 million by 2030 [2]. In South Korea, HCC is the seventh most common cancer and has the second-highest mortality rate after lung cancer [3]. Alarmingly, it is the principal cause of death among economically active individuals in their forties and fifties, resulting in a substantial disease burden [4].

Detected early, HCC can be cured, but the prognosis remains poor for advanced stages, despite medical advances [5,6]. In South Korea, approximately 45% of HCC patients are diagnosed early enough for potential curative treatment [7]. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system recommends liver resection for patients with early-stage and/or single tumors and those with preserved liver function [8]. However, the post-surgical outlook is concerning with a 5-year survival rate of nearly 50% and a recurrence rate, predominantly intrahepatic, reaching as high as 80%. The prognosis for extrahepatic recurrence (EHR) is particularly grim [9,10].

Recent advances in HCC management have emphasized the importance of predictive models to assess the post-surgical risk of recurrence [11]. These models—incorporating tumor characteristics, liver function, cirrhosis status, and surgical margins—have proven pivotal in guiding postoperative surveillance and adjuvant therapy decisions. Notably, the ERASL score, which includes variables such as gender, ALBI grade, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and both tumor size and number, is relatively accurate in predicting HCC recurrence [12]. The ALBI score, a simple yet effective metric based on serum albumin and bilirubin levels, was initially identified in Japan in 2015 as a prognostic tool for overall survival post-hepatectomy and has since gained widespread acceptance [13,14]. More recently, predictive models utilizing deep learning and artificial intelligence have been introduced with mixed results [15–17].

Despite advances in surgical techniques and postoperative care, the high incidence of EHR followed by curative HCC resection remains a major concern. The development of EHR not only marks HCC progression but also limits therapeutic options, necessitating meticulous pre- and postoperative assessments to identify potential patients. However, research into the factors associated with EHR remains limited. This study investigates the occurrence of EHR in the ten years after curative HCC resection, analyzing both pre- and postoperative risk factors.

We conducted a retrospective review of data from treatment-naïve HCC patients and enrolled patients who underwent curative HCC resection from 2004 to 2019 at four tertiary hospitals in South Korea. We excluded patients with previous treatment history for HCC or concurrent malignancies; those who previously received multi-modality treatments, non-curative resection, perioperative mortality, or liver transplantation; and those with incomplete clinical data. Patients diagnosed with EHR within 60 days after surgery were also excluded, in consideration of the possibility that recurrence may have been present at the time of surgery. This study protocol followed the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by each hospital’s institutional review board. Written informed consent was waived by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions due to the retrospective nature of the study.

We examined recurrence characteristics post-resection and identified predictors of EHR in HCC patients following curative surgery. Diagnoses adhered to the Korean Liver Cancer Association’s and the National Cancer Center’s guidelines [18,19]. We primarily used the modified Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system, with the BCLC staging system acting as a supplementary tool. The modified UICC staging system classifies HCC based on tumor size, number, vascular invasion, and lymph node involvement, and is considered a standard staging method in Korean clinical practice [18,19]. Follow-up appointments were conducted from the surgery date (index date), with CT or MRI every three months according to institutional guidelines. Demographic and liver cancer data included modified UICC stage, BCLC stage, AFP levels, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) levels, indocyanine green retention test (ICGR15) results, and Milan criteria status. Liver function was assessed through clinical chemistry tests, the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score, and ALBI grade. Tumor characteristics—such as size; number; Edmonson–Steiner grade; histologic type; and presence of microvascular invasion, serosal invasion, bile duct invasion, capsule formation, intrahepatic metastasis, and necrosis were evaluated. EHR was defined by radiological evidence of cancer cells spreading to organs other than the liver and forming masses. EHR sites and clinical characteristics at diagnosis were also analyzed.

To evaluate the reproducibility and potential generalizability of the models, we performed an institution-based cohort division. Patients from two centers were assigned to the derivation cohort for model development, while patients from the remaining two centers formed the validation cohort. The EHR-preop and EHR-postop models were developed using multivariable Cox regression analyses in the derivation cohort, and the resulting β-coefficients were used to construct risk scores. Risk groups were defined based on the 50th and 85th percentiles of the derivation cohort’s risk score distribution and were subsequently applied to the validation cohort.

Data are presented as means ± standard deviations or as counts (percentages). Continuous or categorical variables across groups were compared using the t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA. Cox regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with EHR, leading to the development of a risk prediction scoring system based on Cox regression coefficients. Risk scores (EHR-preop and EHR-postop) were calculated as the sum of each variable multiplied by its corresponding β-coefficient derived from the multivariable Cox regression models. A higher total score reflected a greater risk of extrahepatic recurrence. The Kaplan–Meier method assessed cumulative overall mortality rates, with differences evaluated via the logrank test. Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 23.0). Significance was determined by two-tailed tests, with P-values < 0.05 deemed significant.

A total of 1,069 HCC patients treated with surgical resection were enrolled. Figure1presents a flow chart detailing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 683 patients comprised the derivation cohort for model development, and 386 patients were assigned to the validation cohort. In the derivation cohort, the mean patient age was 59.8 years, and 85.7% of patients were male. Most (98.7%) had compensated liver function, and the most common etiology for their chronic liver disease was chronic hepatitis B (72.9%). The study identified 107 cases of EHR. Table1compares the baseline characteristics of the EHR and non-EHR groups. No significant differences in gender, chronic liver disease etiology, or CTP scores were observed. A higher proportion of patients in the EHR group had an ALBI grade of ≥ 2. The EHR group also exhibited more advanced disease stages according to the modified UICC and BCLC staging systems, with a significantly greater number of patients not meeting the Milan criteria. Laboratory values, including white blood cell count, prothrombin time, bilirubin, AFP, and PIVKA-II levels, showed no significant variation between the groups.

As described in Table2, the EHR group exhibited larger tumor sizes (3.9 ± 2.5 non-EHR vs. 5.2 ± 3.4 EHR) and a statistically significant increase in tumor number. Higher Edmonson–Steiner grades were more prevalent in the EHR group, indicating advanced tumors. There was also a greater incidence of serosal and bile duct invasion in the EHR group. Notably, there was a marked difference in the presence of microvascular invasion (12.0% non-EHR vs. 37.4% EHR). Higher rates of serosal invasion and necrosis were also observed in the EHR group.

Among the entire cohort, 175 patients developed HER. Of these, 65 (37.1%) experienced their first recurrence as EHR, and the mean duration of EHR was 34.6 ± 32.4 months. EHR occurred in 92 patients (52.6%) within two years of curative resection; late recurrence (more than two years after resection) was observed in 83 patients (47.4%). The characteristics of EHR and their respective sites are detailed in Supplementary Table (1) The lung was the most common site of metastasis, followed by bone and abdominal lymph node. The clinical characteristics at the time of EHR diagnosis are summarized in Supplementary Table (2) The most common diagnostic method for EHR was abdominal CT (110 cases), followed by chest CT, spine CT or MRI, and PET/CT. In the majority of patients, elevated AFP and PIVKA-II levels were observed in the last test before EHR diagnosis.

In the univariable Cox regression analysis, nine risk factors were identified as significant predictors of EHR, including age, tumor size and number, staging according to modified UICC and BCLC guidelines, ALBI and CTP grade, AFP levels, and Milan criteria status. Multivariable analysis refined these factors, strongly associating with EHR younger age, high modified UICC stage, an ALBI grade ≥ 2, and exceeding the Milan criteria (Table3).

Utilizing the coefficients from the Cox regression analysis, we developed a scoring system, dubbed the EHR-preop score, to predict EHR. The formula for calculating the EHR-preop score is − 1.470 × ln(Age) + 0.806 × (modified UICC stage) + 0.699 × Exceeding the Milan criteria (0: no, 1: yes) + 0.663 × ALBI grade (0: Grade 1, 1: Grade 2 or 3).

Utilizing the EHR-preop score and employing cutoff values of 50% and 85% (score thresholds of −2.59 and − 1.70), we classified HCC patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories for developing EHR. This stratification allowed for detailed survival analysis using Kaplan–Meier plots, as illustrated in Fig.2A.

We linked 15 postoperative risk factors to EHR, of which 12 were significant. Six factors were crucial in the stepwise multivariable analysis: age, tumor number, microvascular invasion, necrosis, Milan criteria status, and ALBI grade (Table4). We formulated the EHR-postop score to predict EHR-free survival, and using cutoffs of 50% and 85% with thresholds of −3.96 and − 3.22, we categorized patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on Kaplan–Meier plots (Fig.2B). EHR-postop score = − 1.139 × ln(Age) + 0.637 × tumor number (0: 1 tumor, 1: 2–3 tumors, 2: >3 tumors) + 0.979 × Microvascular invasion (0: no, 1: yes) + 0.439 × Necrosis (0: no, 1: yes) + 0.696 × Exceeding the Milan criteria (0: no, 1: yes) + 0.602 × ALBI grade (0: Grade 1, 1: Grade 2 or 3).

The predictive performance of the EHR-preoperative (EHR-preop) and EHR-postoperative (EHR-postop) models was evaluated in the validation cohort (n= 386) using the β-coefficients derived from the derivation cohort. Patients were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on the 50th and 85th percentiles of the risk score distribution from the derivation cohort, and these cut-off values were applied to the validation cohort. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated distinct differences in EHR-free survival across the three risk groups in the validation cohort (Fig.3).

We initially analyzed the difference in overall survival rates based on the presence of EHR and found that the prognosis in the EHR group was statistically significantly worse, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Next, using the EHR-preop and EHR-postop scores, we analyzed the overall survival rates according to the EHR-pre and EHR-post categories. In the derivation cohort, these risk categories significantly distinguished overall survival in HCC patients (Supplementary Fig. 2), and the results were similarly validated in the independent validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. 3).

HCC remains a critical global health issue, with its prognosis heavily reliant on early detection and effective treatment strategies. Curative resection, the primary treatment for early-stage HCC, offers a potential cure [20]. However, the risk of postoperative recurrence, including EHR, significantly worsens prognosis and survival outcomes. While past studies have investigated recurrence following HCC, EHR has rarely been their focus. Prior research has identified that not all HCC patients develop EHR, only in some. An observational study over nine years reported that approximately a quarter of HCC patients developed EHR [21]. Therefore, understanding the characteristics and assessing the risk factors associated with EHR are crucial for enhancing patient management, refining follow-up protocols, and ultimately, improving survival rates.

Previous studies have analyzed intrahepatic reoccurrence and EHR following curative resection for HCC as early and late recurrence based on a two-year criterion [22,23]. Others have analyzed EHR risk through clinically usable blood tests and tumor characteristics [24–26]. Further studies have employed diagnostic imaging, with one reporting that PET/CT scans can help predict EHR [27]. Our study is significant in that it involved over 1000 patients, incorporating clinical, imaging, and histological findings to identify pre- and postoperative EHR risk factors, thereby developing a scoring system to predict risk. By comprehensively analyzing the predictors of EHR, this research contributes to the development of predictive models, which could help clinicians better assess patients’ risk, enabling personalized treatment plans and follow-up schedules, reducing the incidence of EHR overall.

Histological findings included in the EHR-postop scores could help predict HCC recurrence. Blood tests and diagnostic imaging studies are the current predominant predictors, but adding pathological data can increase prediction accuracy. The use of digital pathology coupled with machine learning has proven to be a good model for predicting HCC recurrence [28,29]. However, histological findings are only known after surgery, so distinguishing between pre- and postoperative risk factors can be helpful in clinical application.

Based on the variables for predicting EHR after curative resection for HCC, we investigated the pre- and postoperative risk factors. In the derivation cohort, our results revealed that younger age, a high modified UICC stage, exceeding the Milan criteria, and an ALBI grade ≥ 2 were independently significant preoperative EHR predictors. Similarly, younger age, multiple tumors, the presence of microvascular invasion and necrosis, exceeding the Milan criteria, and an ALBI grade ≥ 2 were independently significant postoperative EHR predictors. To assess model performance, we applied the EHR-preop and EHR-postop models developed in the derivation cohort to a separate validation cohort. Both models showed consistent risk stratification in the validation cohort, supporting their external applicability.

Age is recognized as a risk factor for most cancers, and in the context of liver transplantation, old age is a relative contraindication and risk factor. Age reportedly impacts outcomes more than other tumor factors following liver resection, particularly for patients over 70 [11]. However, the effect of age on EHR might be reversed; an analysis of EHR in 285 patients who received locoregional therapy for HCC showed higher recurrence rates in those aged under 65 [30]. Our study similarly observed a tendency for the hazard ratio to decrease with increasing age. One possible explanation for the decrease in recurrence rates with increasing age could be the biological behavior of tumors in older patients. As individuals age, there might be changes in tumor biology, such as slower growth, meaning older patients are less likely to develop aggressive forms of cancer that are prone to metastasize.

The modified UICC staging system for HCC incorporates tumor size and number, reflecting the impact of these factors on prognosis [1]. Studies have shown that larger and more numerous tumors elevate the risk of intrahepatic metastasis and poorer outcomes, and they also influence the likelihood of EHR [7,24]. Since 2002, the Milan criteria have been a benchmark, endorsed by the United Network for Organ Sharing, for selecting HCC patients for liver transplantation. Whether patients who do not meet these criteria are suitable for liver resection is debated. Evidence suggests that such patients typically face worse recurrence-free survival rates [31]. A study by the HCC East–West group, analyzing data from nine centers globally, showed that patients who do not meet the Milan criteria, without significant vascular invasion, had a 5-year overall survival rate of 57% and a disease-free survival rate of 27% [32]. Our findings similarly indicate a heightened risk of EHR after surgery in patients exceeding the Milan criteria. Finally, the ALBI grade, a validated liver function metric, emerged as a prognostic factor for HCC; an ALBI grade ≥ 2 correlates with an increased risk of EHR.

Vascular invasion, especially microvascular invasion, is a well-known prognostic indicator of HCC. Prior research has documented the association between vascular invasion and the likelihood of recurrence following resection or alternative locoregional therapeutic interventions [33–35]. Previous studies have also highlighted the significance of vascular invasion in the context of EHR [22,36]. Notably, portal vein invasion has been associated with a twofold increase in EHR [21]. Yang et al. found that vascular invasion, intrahepatic metastasis, and advanced HCC stages significantly raise the risk of EHR [10]. Another recent study linked tumor necrosis to more advanced stages of HCC, a higher HCC recurrence, and worse survival rates after curative resection for HCC [37]. Our study also associated these factors with a high rate of EHR.

Our findings have significant clinical application; they offer a robust framework to enhance the personalized management of HCC. The EHR-preop and EHR-postop models developed in this study can be applied in clinical practice to estimate an individual patient’s risk of developing EHR. By integrating our predictive models into routine clinical practice, healthcare professionals can more accurately identify HCC patients at elevated risk of EHR following curative resection. Clinicians can input relevant clinical or pathological variables into the respective formulas to calculate individualized risk scores, which can be used to estimate the probability of extrahepatic recurrence and stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups based on predefined cut-off values.

For instance, the EHR-preop score can assist in determining surgical eligibility, particularly in borderline cases, by providing objective risk estimates before resection. Conversely, the EHR-postop score, which incorporates pathological findings, may guide postoperative surveillance intensity and identify candidates for adjuvant therapies. A notable strength of our study is the ability to predict recurrence using both preoperative and postoperative factors. This dual-model approach enables early risk assessment prior to surgery and more accurate prognostication after histological information becomes available. This advancement allows for tailored follow-up strategies and interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes by proactively addressing their risk of EHR.

The study, while providing valuable insights into predictors of EHR, has limitations. Its retrospective nature and the inclusion of data from only four tertiary centers hinder the generalizability of the findings. Although we performed validation using a separate cohort based on participating institutions, further external validation using broader, more diverse cohorts is necessary to confirm their applicability and reliability in different clinical settings. Acknowledging these limitations is crucial for interpreting the study’s results and for the cautious application of the predictive models in practice. Prospective studies could further refine these models and evaluate their predictive accuracy in real-time clinical decision-making. Additionally, distinguishing between early and late EHR, as well as differentiating between initial EHR occurrences and progression to EHR following locoregional recurrence, would provide deeper insights into the disease’s behavior. This distinction could inform more targeted surveillance and treatment strategies, potentially improving patient outcomes.

This study highlights the importance of comprehensive pre- and postoperative evaluations in predicting EHR in HCC patients following curative resection. By identifying significant predictors, the developed predictive models enable the identification of patients at increased risk of EHR and calculation of the probability of EHR before and after resection. These models, upon further validation, could significantly refine clinical decision-making, contributing to personalized HCC management and potentially improving patient outcomes by targeting high-risk individuals for more intensive monitoring or adjuvant therapy.
