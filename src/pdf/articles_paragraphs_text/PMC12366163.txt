Porcine astrovirus (PAstV) poses a major risk to the pig industry by causing diarrhea in suckling piglets. Despite its global prevalence and five genotypes, the virus’s pathogenic mechanism is not well understood due to difficulties in isolating and culturing it in vitro. Studying PAstV from clinical samples and its interaction with host cells is crucial for understanding its pathogenesis and developing antiviral treatments.

To isolate porcine astrovirus (PAstV) from clinical specimens, fecal samples from PAstV-positive pigs were collected in August 2018, inoculated into PK-15 cells, and subjected to three successive blind passages. The in vitro growth characteristics of the isolated strain were subsequently evaluated, and the morphology of the virus particles was examined through electron microscopy. The complete genome sequence of the isolated strain was determined, followed by sequence alignment, homology analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and recombination analysis. To investigate the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in PK-15 cells infected with the isolated strain, the cells were infected, and ROS production was quantified using the MitoSOX probe. Furthermore, the expression levels of the antioxidant factors Nrf2 and HO-1 were analyzed via Western blotting. Mitochondrial damage resulting from PAstV infection was observed using transmission electron microscopy, and the effect of PAstV infection on mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the JC-1 probe. Finally, the impact of ROS on PAstV replication was explored using IFA and RT-qPCR.

In this study, a strain of PAstV was isolated from porcine fecal samples, demonstrating an ability to adapt effectively to PK-15 cells with a viral titer reaching up to 10^7.85 TCID50/mL. Genetic evolution analysis classified the isolated strain as PAstV5, revealing high genetic homology with other representative PAstV5 strains. The isolated strain was designated as PAstV5-GX2. Sequence alignment identified 11 consecutive amino acid deletions at the 3’ end of ORF1a in the PAstV5-GX2 strain, resulting in alterations to the three-dimensional structure of the nsp1a/4 protein. Further investigation indicated that PAstV infection in PK-15 cells enhances mitochondrial ROS production and diminishes the protein expression levels of the antioxidant molecules Nrf2 and HO-1. Concurrently, PAstV infection induces mitochondrial swelling, cristae rupture, and vacuolization, along with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. Through the application of H2O2and NAC to modulate cellular ROS levels, it was determined that ROS can facilitate viral replication.

Our study successfully isolated a novel strain of PAstV5 characterized by an 11-amino acid deletion in the nsp1a protein, leading to significant alterations in the three-dimensional structure of the nsp1a/4 protein. This strain was observed to induce the production of mitochondrial ROS, downregulate the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1, and cause mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, the generation of mitochondrial ROS was found to facilitate the replication of PAstV. These findings offer valuable insights into the genetic evolution and pathogenic mechanisms of PAstV.

Astroviruses (AstV), members of theAstroviridaefamily, are non-enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses capable of infecting a diverse range of animal hosts, including humans, pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, and geese [1]. Among these, human astrovirus (HAstV) is considered one of the three major pathogens causing diarrhea in children [2]. Based on their host specificity, AstV are classified into two genera:Mamastrovirus(MAstV), which infects mammalian species, andAvastrovirus(AAstV), which infects avian species [1]. The genome of AstV spans approximately 6.2–7.8 kilobases (kb) and comprises three distinct open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1b are situated at the 5’ end of the viral genome and encode nonstructural proteins, including serine protease, viral genome-linked protein (VPg), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In contrast, ORF2 is located at the 3′ end of the viral genome and primarily encodes the viral capsid protein, which is implicated in virus-cell receptor binding and the induction of neutralizing antibodies [3]. In recent years, a novel open reading frame (ORFX) located within the ORF2 region has been identified in human astrovirus (HAstV) and porcine astrovirus (PAstV). This ORFX has been implicated in the egress of the virus through viroporin activity; however, its impact on viral replication appears to be minimal [4,5].

PAstV was initially identified through electron microscopy in fecal samples from pigs exhibiting diarrhea in 1980 [6]. Currently, PAstV comprises five distinct genotypes (PAstV1-5), exhibiting significant variability in prevalence across different geographical regions. For instance, the PAstV positive rate in Greece and India was found to be 95.4% and 17.6%, with PAstV3 and PAstV4 being the predominant genotypes, respectively [7,8]. In our previous study, a PAstV positive rate of 56.4% was observed in Guangxi province, China, where all five genotypes of PAstV strains are commonly present in pig populations [9]. PAstV infection predominantly causes degeneration and necrosis of the small intestinal villi in suckling piglets, leading to diarrhea and impaired growth [10]. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the virus can infect tissues beyond the intestinal tract, resulting in encephalitis and respiratory distress in affected individuals [11–13], thereby highlighting its complex pathogenic mechanisms.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a category of short-lived, reactive, and unstable partially reduced derivatives of oxygen that primarily arise from oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria. Under physiological conditions, a homeostatic balance is maintained between ROS and the antioxidant defense system, which regulates ROS levels to prevent excessive accumulation [14]. However, when cells encounter various stressors, such as viral infections, they may produce ROS in quantities that exceed the capacity of the body’s antioxidant defenses, leading to a state of oxidative stress [15]. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) serves as a pivotal transcription factor in the regulation of the antioxidant defense response. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 resides in the cytoplasm, sequestered by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Upon exposure to elevated levels of ROS, the Keap1–Nrf2 complex dissociates, allowing Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences, thereby initiating the transcription of target genes. Subsequent activation of Nrf2 leads to the upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which plays a critical role in scavenging free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative stress [16]. Consequently, the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway is intricately involved in the regulation of ROS production in the context of viral infections [17].

Porcine astrovirus (PAstV) is widely prevalent in pig populations globally; however, the pathogenic mechanisms, particularly the molecular interactions between the virus and host cells, remain inadequately understood. This knowledge gap is largely attributable to the challenges associated with isolating and culturing the virus in vitro. To date, only two strains of PAstV have been successfully isolated in vitro: PAstV5-AH29-2014 and PAstV1-GX1 [10,18]. Notably, the PAstV1-GX1 strain was isolated by our laboratory in previous studies and has since been extensively employed in experimental research. In this study, we successfully isolated a novel PAstV5 strain from fecal samples of diarrheic piglets, designated as PAstV5-GX2, and performed a comprehensive whole genome sequence analysis. Subsequently, we compared the in vitro growth characteristics of the PAstV5-GX2 strain with those of the PAstV1-GX1 strain, and examined the relationship between their in vitro replication and the induction of mitochondrial ROS production in host cells. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic evolution and pathogenic mechanisms associated with PAstV.

PK-15 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). PAstV1-GX1 strain was isolated and stored in our laboratory [10]. Fluorescein (FITC)–conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (SA00003-2), CoraLite®Plus 594-Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (RGAR004), Anti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibodies (16396-1-AP), and Anti-HO-1 polyclonal antibodies (10701-1-AP) were purchased from Proteintech (Wuhan, China). Anti-PAstV1 nsp1a/1, nsp1a/3 and nsp1a/4 polyclonal antibodies were produced in our laboratory.

In August 2018, a fecal sample was collected from a suckling piglet exhibiting symptoms of diarrhea from a pigery in Guilin City, Guangxi Province, China. This sample was subsequently analyzed for the presence of PAstV using the RT-PCR method as previously described [9]. For the purpose of virus isolation, supernatants from the fecal sample that tested positive for PAstV were filtered through 0.22 μm filters. Following filtration, 500 µL of the supernatants were inoculated into PK-15 cells cultured in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. After incubation, the cell supernatants were discarded, and 2 mL of DMEM containing 1‰ tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin were added to the cells, which were then further incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. Following three cycles of freezing and thawing, the cell supernatants were collected and subjected to blind passage for three generations in PK-15 cells. The successful isolation of PAstV in PK-15 cells was confirmed using the RT-PCR method as previously described [9].

To obtain the complete genome sequence of the isolated virus, ten pairs of specific primers, as detailed in Table1, were designed to target the conserved regions of the genome of PAstV5 strains. Total viral RNA was extracted from the suspension of PAstV5-GX2-infected third-generation cells, and cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Vazyme) with specific downstream primers corresponding to each fragment. PCR amplification was conducted in a 50 µL reaction mixture, which comprised 25 µL of 2 × Phanta Max Master Mix (Vazyme), 1 µL of each 10 µM primer, 2 µL of cDNA, and 21 µL of double-distilled water (ddH2O). The PCR products were purified and subsequently cloned into the pMD™18-T vector. Following this, the constructs were sent for bidirectional Sanger sequencing (Sangon). The 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR genes were amplified utilizing the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, the complete genome sequences of the PAstV5-GX2 strain were assembled using SnapGene software. Sequence alignments and homology analyses were performed using DNASTAR software (Version 7.1). The 3D structure of nsp1a/4 and nsp1a proteins was predicted using the Alpha Fold Server online website(https://golgi.sandbox.google.com).

Reference sequences for diverse astrovirus species were sourced from the GenBank database. Phylogenetic trees were generated utilizing full-length genome sequences and ORF2 gene sequences through the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA; version 11) software, with the incorporation of 1000 bootstrap replicates to ensure robustness. The visualization of the phylogenetic tree was executed using the Chiplot online platform (https://www.chiplot.online/tvbot.html), with the process being conducted under the advisement of the website’s developer (30). Recombination analysis was conducted utilizing the RDP4 software, with a maximum acceptable p-value set at 0.05. The recombinant events within the PAstV5-GX2 genome were further validated through analysis with SimPlot v3.5.1 software (JHK University, Baltimore, MD, USA), employing default parameters.

To determine the virus titer, the virus suspension was subjected to a 10-fold serial dilution in serum-free DMEM, ranging from 10− 1to 10− 10. These dilutions were subsequently inoculated into PK-15 cells cultured in 96-well plates, with each dilution tested in six replicate wells. Following a 1-hour adsorption period, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with DMEM supplemented with 1‰ TPCK-treated trypsin for a duration of 5 days. The number of wells exhibiting cytopathic effects at each dilution was recorded. The virus titers, expressed as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), were calculated using the Reed and Muench method [19]. To examine the in vitro growth characteristics of isolated PAstV, PK-15 cells cultured in 6-well plates were infected with PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 at a MOI of 0.01. After a 1-hour adsorption period, the cells were subjected to two washes with PBS and subsequently incubated in DMEM supplemented with 1‰ TPCK-treated trypsin. Supernatant samples (200 µL per well) were collected from the infected cells at 12-hour intervals until 72 h. The viral titers in the collected samples were quantified using a TCID50titration assay conducted inPK-15 cells, as described above. A growth curve was constructed with the time post-infection (hpi) represented on the x-axis and the corresponding viral titers at each time point represented on the y-axis.

PK-15 cells were infected with PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 at a MOI of 0.01. At 24 hpi, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. Following fixation, the cells were washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) and subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h. Subsequently, the PAstV1-GX1 strain nsp1a/1, nsp1a/3, and nsp1a/4 polyclonal antibodies kept in the laboratory were used as primary antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed five times with PBS and then incubated with either Fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) or CoraLite®Plus 594-Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) for 1 h at 37 °C. After an additional five washes with PBS, DAPI antifade (Solarbio, Beijin, China) was applied for nuclear staining. The cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope (ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA).

The virus particles and mitochondrial morphology were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To observe viral morphology, thirty milliliters of viral samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were filtered through 0.22 μm filters, combined with 7.5 mL of 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000), and stirred overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 h, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitated viruses were resuspended in 500 µL of Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The viral particles were then prepared for TEM analysis. For the observation of mitochondrial morphology, 1 × 106PAstV-infected cells were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 1% (v/v) osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 1 h and then dehydrated using absolute ethanol prior to embedding in Epon resin. Ultra-thin sections were then examined using TEM.

PK-15 cells were either mock-infected or infected with PAstV, subsequently harvested and lysed using RIPA buffer supplemented with 1% PMSF (Solarbio) at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein supernatant was collected and taken for protein concentration determination by BCA method and then mixed with 5×loading buffer, followed by denaturation through boiling at 100 °C for 10 min. The collected protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE protein electrophoresis, and then protein transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Solarbio) membrane was performed at 10v, 200 mA. The membranes were closed at 37 °C for 2 h using 5% skim milk and after three washes with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST). Following this, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4℃ with primary antibodies specific to Nrf2, HO-1, PAstV1 nsp1a/4 or β-actin. After an additional three washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein visualization was achieved using the BeyoECL Plus kit (Beyotime).

PK-15 cells cultured in 96-well plates were subjected to infection with PAstV or treatment with H2O2(Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA). Following the removal of cell supernatants, the cells were washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were stained with 1 µM MitoSOX (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, protected from light. After staining, the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM. The red fluorescence intensity, indicative of mtROS levels, was then analyzed using fluorescence microscopy.

The mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed utilizing the JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Kit (Beyotime). PK-15 cells were infected with PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 strains. At 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hpi, the cell supernatants were removed and replaced with JC-1 staining working solution, followed by incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2for 20 min. After incubation, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with JC-1 staining buffer before adding 2 mL of DMEM. Finally, the cells were examined using fluorescent microscopy, where JC-1 monomers were detected at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and JC-1 aggregates were detected at an excitation wavelength of 525 nm.

To establish a SYBR Green I real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method specifically for PAstV5-GX2, a pair of specific primers was designed based on the PAstV5-GX2 ORF2 gene using Primer Premier 6 software (Premier Biosoft International), with the forward primer sequence being 5′ -GACGCAACACGCACCTAATC-3′ and the reverse primer sequence being 5′-GACGCGCTTCATAAACCACC-3′. The resulting amplified fragments were subsequently cloned into the pMD™18-T vector (Takara) to produce standard plasmids. These plasmids were subjected to serial dilutions in 10-fold increments. Under optimized conditions for quantitative PCR amplification, a positive recombinant plasmid with dilutions ranging from 1.1 × 10− 3to 1.1 × 10− 8was selected as the standard template for the establishment of a standard curve for PAstV5-GX2. Viral total RNA was extracted utilizing the QiAMP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by reverse transcription using the Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The quantification of the PAstV5-GX2 copy number in PK-15 cells was conducted employing the qPCR method developed in this study, while the copy number of PAstV1-GX1 was determined according to previously established protocols [20].

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 using one-way ANOVA to evaluate differences among groups. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation, with significance indicated as follows: *,P< 0.05; **,P< 0.01; ***,P< 0.001; ****,P< 0.0001.

To isolate PAstV, clinical fecal samples from diarrheic piglets that tested positive for PAstV were inoculated into PK-15 cells. Following three generations of blind passage, distinct cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed. Subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, coupled with sequencing of a partial RdRp gene [9], preliminarily confirmed the successful isolation of a PAstV5 strain in PK-15 cells, designated as PAstV5-GX2. The isolated strain demonstrated stable passage in PK-15 cells for over 10 generations, achieving a virus titer of up to 10^7.85 TCID50/mL. To compare the in vitro growth characteristics of PAstV5-GX2 with PAstV1-GX1, which was previously isolated in our study [10], PK-15 cells were inoculated with the 10th passage of PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Observational data revealed that both viral strains induced mild cytopathic effects (CPE) starting at 24 h post-infection (hpi), characterized by cell aggregation and shrinkage. More pronounced CPE, including cell detachment and fragmentation, were observed at 48 hpi (Fig.1A). The presence of both viral strains in PK-15 cells was confirmed using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with polyclonal antibodies targeting PAstV1 non-structural proteins nsp1a/1, nsp1a/3, and nsp1a/4 as the primary antibodies (Fig.1B). The results of the multi-step growth curve analysis indicate that PAstV5-GX2 exhibits growth kinetics comparable to those of PAstV1-GX1 in PK-15 cells. During the initial stages of infection (6–18 hpi), PAstV5-GX2 replicates to a higher level than PAstV1-GX1, achieving a peak titer of 10^7.50 TCID50/mL at 60 hpi, while PAstV1-GX1 reaches a peak titer of 10^6.90 TCID50/mL at 48 hpi (Fig.1C). Additionally, electron microscopy revealed the presence of typical virus-like particles in PAstV5-GX2, with a diameter of approximately 30 nm (Fig.1D).

To obtain the complete genome sequence of PAstV5-GX2, a set of ten specific primers was designed, as outlined in Table2. The full-length genome was subsequently amplified utilizing an overlapping RT-PCR approach. The resulting sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numberPP968017. The genome of strain PAstV5-GX2 is 6,448 nucleotides long and contains three open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a (2,586 nt, positions 89-2674), ORF1b (1,452 nt, positions 2695–4146), and ORF2 (2,340 nt, positions 3992–6331). ORF1a is translated into non-structural protein 1a (nsp1a), which is subsequently produce four cleavage products through a protease cleavage mechanism. The 3 C-like serine protease domain within the nsp1a polyprotein was identified utilizing the Phyre2 online tool. Based on the cleavage site reference from the nsp1a polyprotein of HAstV1 [21], potential cleavage sites within the nsp1a of PAstV5-GX2 are predicted to occur at residues A169/W170, L414/A415, and T580/M581. These cleavage sites are anticipated to facilitate the processing of the nsp1a of PAstV5-GX2 into four non-structural proteins: nsp1a/1, nsp1a/2, nsp1a/3, and nsp1a/4, with nsp1a/3 being specifically designated as the 3 C-like serine protease. The ORF1b region is translated into non-structural protein 1b (nsp1b), which serves as the RdRp. Meanwhile, the ORF2 region is translated into the capsid protein, which can subsequently be cleaved by protease into Vp27, Vp34, and other proteins. These ORFs are flanked by a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of 88 nt (positions 1–88) and a 3′ UTR of 117 nt (positions 6332–6448). A conserved heptanucleotide frameshift signal (AAAAAAC) is at the 3′ end of ORF1a, and a stem-loop structure is found within the 3′ UTR (Fig.2). The PAstV5-GX2 strain exhibits 73.0–91.0% whole-genome identity with other published PAstV5 strains in GenBank (as detailed in Table2), showing the highest identity with the China strain PAstV5-AH29-2014. A comparative analysis of the ORF regions among PAstV5-GX2 and various reference strains revealed that ORF1b exhibits the highest degree of conservation, followed by ORF1a, while ORF2 demonstrates the greatest variability.

Notably, among the 22 complete genome sequences of PAstV5 submitted to GenBank, eight strains, including PAstV5-GX2, exhibited a consecutive deletion of 11 amino acids (LQSHPGPVEPT) at the 3′ end of ORF1a, with this deletion being entirely situated within the nsp1a/4 region. (Fig.3A). All eight strains with this deletion originated from Asia (specifically China and Japan), whereas strains without the deletion were predominantly from Europe and America (Fig.3B). This phenomenon of continuous deletion in ORF1a appears to be unique to PAstV5 and is not observed in other PAstV genotypes. To investigate the implications of this deletion on the structural characteristics of the viral protein, we employed the AlphaFold Service’s protein 3D structure visualization model to simulate the three-dimensional structure of the viral nsp1a/4 protein, using PAstV5-GX2 as a representative of the deletion strain and strainJF713711.1as a representative of the non-deletion strain. The results revealed that the continuous deletion region exhibited β-folding in the nsp1a/4 protein. In the non-deletion strain, this region maintained a 180° angle; however, in the deletion strain, the angle shifted from 180° to 60°. Furthermore, this deletion induced notable alterations in the orientation and spatial positioning of the peptide chain of nsp1a/4 (Fig.4).

To study the genetic evolution of PAstV5-GX2 compared to other PAstV strains, 89 complete genome sequences from PAstV1 to PAstV5 were obtained from GenBank for phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that all PAstV strains formed five distinct clades, with PAstV5-GX2 in the PAstV5 clade (Fig.5A). Pairwise sequence identity analysis indicated that the identity scores among different PAstV genotypes were below 60%, reflecting low genetic similarity (Fig.5B). To further explore the evolutionary relationships among various species of astroviruses, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the full-length ORF2 gene. Consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome, the different genotypes of PAstV strains are categorized into distinct branches, with PAstV5-GX2 clustering alongside other PAstV5 strains. Our findings show a surprising genetic link between different PAstV genotypes and other species of astrovirus. PAstV2 is closely related to bovine astrovirus, with an evolutionary distance of 1.27 to 1.72, placing them on the same narrow phylogenetic branch. In contrast, PAstV1 is on the same major branch as human, canine, and feline astroviruses, being closer to feline (1.06–1.15) and human astroviruses (1.07–1.32). PAstV3 and PAstV4 are closely related to bat and rodent astroviruses (1.87–2.26), while PAstV5 shows a more independent evolution, with distances over 2 from other strains. This indicates that different PAstV genotypes may have unique genetic evolution patterns (Fig.5C).

The complete genome sequences of the PAstV5-GX2 strain were subjected to recombination analysis utilizing the RDP4 and Simplot software packages. The analysis revealed a recombination event occurring between nucleotides 5438 and 6388 in the PAstV5-GX2 genome, which is located within the ORF2 region. The recombinant fragment is predicted to have originated from the recombination of the PoAstV5/JPN/HgTa2-1-3/2015 and PoAstV5/Swine/CHI/FB016/2017 strains. (P-value = 3.618 × 10 − 13; Fig.5D).

ROS serve as crucial intracellular signaling molecules within the cellular system, with mitochondria recognized as essential organelles responsible for their production. To evaluate the levels of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in cells infected with PAstV, MitoSOX Red, a specific fluorescent indicator for mtROS, was employed. The results demonstrated that infection with PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 in PK-15 cells significantly increased mtROS production, particularly within the 6 to 12 hpi interval (Fig.6A). Furthermore, PAstV infection resulted in the degradation of essential antioxidant signaling molecules, Nrf2 and HO-1. This was evidenced by significantly reduced expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 infected cells compared to uninfected control cells (Mock) at 24 and 36 hpi. However, treatment of infected cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was observed to restore Nrf2 and HO-1 levels (Fig.7), indicating PAstV infection induces cell oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is known to damage mitochondria, to assess the effects of PAstV infection on cellular morphology and mitochondrial structure, PK-15 cells were infected with the PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 strains. Following infection, the cellular and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed utilizing electron microscopy. The results showed that cells in the negative control group had normal cellular and mitochondrial morphology and structure. However, PK-15 cells infected with PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 strains resulted in pronounced cellular and mitochondrial damage. Specifically, cells infected with the PAstV5-GX2 strain exhibited characteristic apoptotic features, including cell membrane ectopia and the formation of apoptotic vesicles, while those infected with the PAstV1-GX1 strain demonstrated extensive vacuolization. Notably, both strains induced significant mitochondrial damage, characterized by swelling, cristae rupture, and vacuolization (Fig.8). The JC-1 probe was used to evaluate mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) after PAstV infection. High ΔΨm leads to red fluorescence from JC-1 aggregates, while low ΔΨm results in green fluorescence from monomers. Our results demonstrate that with an increase in the duration of infection, there is a corresponding decrease in ΔΨm, evidenced by a progressive decline in red fluorescence and a concomitant rise in green fluorescence. Both PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 exhibited this same trend (Fig.9). These findings suggest that PAstV infection induces oxidative stress, which subsequently contributes to mitochondrial damage.

The findings presented above indicate that PAstV infection induces oxidative stress. To facilitate a more thorough investigation into the effects of oxidative stress on PAstV replication, PK-15 cells infected with the PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 strains were subjected to treatment with NAC or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to inhibit or induce oxidative stress, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy observations indicated that treatment with NAC suppressed mtROS production and PAstV replication, thereby mitigating cellular damage associated with viral infection. In contrast, exposure to H2O2increased mtROS production, facilitated PAstV replication, and intensified virus-induced cellular damage (Fig.10A). Additionally, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results indicated that the NAC-treated group exhibited significantly lower viral copy numbers compared to the virus infection alone (p< 0.0001), while the H2O2-treated group displayed an increase in viral copy numbers (p<0.01) (Fig.10B). These results suggest that oxidative stress promotes the replication of PAstV. Treatment with NAC alone significantly reduced mtROS production, inhibited the replication of PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1, and alleviated cellular stress.

At present, multiple genotypes of PAstV are widely distributed among swine populations, primarily causing diarrheal symptoms in suckling piglets, which poses a significant threat to the swine industry. However, there are no effective pharmacological treatments or vaccines available to address this viral infection. In comparison to other porcine diarrhea viruses, research on PAstV is relatively limited, with a predominant focus on epidemiological and genetic evolution studies. As a result, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PAstV remain inadequately characterized. Currently, successful isolation of PAstV has been reported by only two laboratories, one of which is our own. In previous studies, our laboratory successfully isolated a strain of PAstV type 1 from feces, designated PAstV1-GX1, and established a reverse genetic system for this strain [22,23]. Subsequent research utilizing PAstV1-GX1 has demonstrated its ability to induce mild diarrhea, growth retardation, and damage to the villi of the small intestinal mucosa in seven-day-old suckling piglets [10]. Furthermore, this strain has been shown to stimulate the production of interferon-beta (IFN-β) through the IRF3-regulated signaling pathway in PK-15 cells [20]. Another isolate of PAstV, designated PAstV5-AH29-2014, belongs to the PAstV5 type and was obtained from a tissue sample infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) [18]. However, no further foundational research has been conducted using this strain to date. In the present study, a novel strain of PAstV5 was successfully isolated from fecal samples of diarrheic piglets. This isolated strain demonstrated stable passage in PK-15 cells, achieving a viral titer of 10^7.85 TCID50/mL. This advancement is highly advantageous for our future investigations into PAstV.

The PAstV5-GX2 was clustered within the PAstV5 branch on the phylogenetic trees and exhibited a complete genome homology ranging from 73.0 to 91.0% with other PAstV5 strains. A notable observation is the identification of an 11-amino-acid deletion within the nsp1a/4 region of PAstV5 strains originating exclusively from Asia. In contrast, strains without this deletion were predominantly identified in Europe and America. This suggests that PAstV may exhibit distinct evolutionary trajectories in different geographical regions. Furthermore, this deletion resulted in significant alterations to the three-dimensional structure of nsp1a/4. The nsp1a/4 protein has been characterized as a phosphoprotein that colocalizes with the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with the viral polymerase [24,25], suggesting a potential role in viral replication. Future research will employ reverse genetic techniques to examine the impact of deleting 11 consecutive amino acids in nsp1a/4 on the replication and pathogenicity of PAstV.

The phylogenetic analysis based on the complete ORF2 gene indicates that the five genotypes of PAstV exhibit significant divergence in genetic evolution; however, they demonstrate closer genetic relationships to other species of astroviruses, including human astrovirus, feline astrovirus, and bovine astrovirus. This suggests that the different genotypes of PAstV may possess distinct ancestral origins. The phenomenon of recombination is frequently observed in astroviruses. For instance, Walter et al. identified a recombinant HAstV strain that contained the ORF2 region from HAstV-5 and the ORF1b region from HAstV-3 [26]. Our recent investigations have also revealed recombinant variants in bovine and goose astroviruses, respectively [27,28]. Notably, the PAstV5-GX2 strain isolated in this study exhibited a recombination event occurring between nucleotides 5438 and 6388 within the full-length genome. This finding suggests that gene recombination may serve as a significant mechanism facilitating the evolution of astroviruses.

ROS serve as crucial signaling molecules influencing a range of cellular responses. Under normal physiological conditions, ROS are continuously generated, yet the antioxidant defense system is typically adequate to prevent ROS-induced damage. Conversely, under pathological conditions, excessive ROS production surpasses the capacity of the endogenous antioxidant system, leading to a cascade of oxidative injuries [29]. Our findings indicate that infection with the PAstV5-GX2 and PAstV1-GX1 strains leads to a significant increase in mtROS production, while simultaneously promoting the degradation of essential antioxidant signaling molecules, namely Nrf2 and HO-1. This dual effect contributes to the establishment of an oxidative stress environment within the cells. If the oxidative stress induced by ROS is not alleviated in a timely manner, it may result in further mitochondrial damage [30]. Our findings further corroborate that PAstV infection leads to mitochondrial swelling, vacuolization, cristae rupture, and a reduction in membrane potential. These observations imply that PAstV may facilitate mitochondrial damage by inducing oxidative stress.

ROS are typically recognized as toxic byproducts during viral infections [31]; however, certain viruses have evolved mechanisms to modulate ROS production to facilitate their own replication. For instance, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) enhances mtROS production via its GP5 protein, thereby promoting viral replication [32]. Similarly, infection with the dengue virus (DENV) leads to alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and induces mtROS production at later stages of infection. Inhibition of mtROS has been shown to reduce DENV replication, highlighting the role of ROS in the viral life cycle [33]. Our studies indicate that the administration of NAC to inhibit mtROS production effectively suppresses the replication of PAstV. Conversely, the induction of mtROS production via H2O2enhances viral replication. These findings indicate that oxidative stress also promote the replication of PAstV; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms require further investigation.

In summary, this study successfully isolated a novel PAstV5 strain utilizing PK-15 cells. Whole genome sequencing identified 11 consecutive amino acid deletions at the 3′ terminus of ORF1a, as well as gene recombination within the ORF2 region. These results suggest that PAstV5 may have a different genetic evolutionary direction than other genotypes. Further analyses demonstrated that infections with both PAstV5 and PAstV1 in PK-15 cells induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, thereby promoting viral replication. These findings enhance the foundational understanding of the genetic evolution and replication mechanisms of PAstV.
