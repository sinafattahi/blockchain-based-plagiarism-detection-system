Sheath rot disease, caused bySarocladium oryzae, is a severe problem in rice cultivation and can result in significant yield loss worldwide. In this study, we analyzed the function ofLOC_Os09G23084, encoding an endoglucanase-1 precursor, through gene overexpression. Two single T-DNA insertion homozygous overexpression lines, 1–16 S and 4–10 S, derived fromOryza sativacv. TNG67, were used for functional characterization. In field conditions, overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084resulted in a decrease in rice development and an increase in susceptibility to sheath rot disease at the harvest stage. The overexpression lines showed delayed maturation, reduced internode and panicle neck length, deformed and less protruded vascular bundles, lower lignin content, and decreased yield. To verify the susceptibility of the overexpression lines to sheath rot disease, we set up a leaf-cutting inoculation method on seedlings. Lesion length was used to assess disease severity and was confirmed by fungal colonization using a GFP-taggedS. oryzaetransgenic strain. The data confirmed that the overexpression lines were more susceptible toS. oryzaethan wild-type lines. The reduced internode length and panicle neck length, less protruded peripheral vascular bundles, and low lignin content might contribute to the susceptibility to sheath rot. In this study, we provide insights into the potential function and mechanism of the endoglucanase geneLOC_Os09g23084in rice susceptibility to sheath rot disease. Additionally, we demonstrated thatLOC_Os09G23084plays a crucial role in rice growth and development.

Rice (Oryza sativaL.) is the staple food for half of the world’s population. However, rice cultivation is threatened by various pathogen attacks, from the nursery to the paddy field. Recently, rice sheath rot, caused bySarocladiumspecies, has become a severe problem during flowering and grain-filling stages, resulting in significant yield loss (Peeters et al.2021; Sakthivel2001).Sarocladiumis a seed-borne pathogen transmitted by wind and insects such as the rice tarsonemid mite and the brown planthopper (Peeters et al.2021). Wounds and stomata are necessary forSarocladiumconidia to germinate and invade the hosts (Bigirimana Vde et al.2015). Subsequently, mycelia colonize in vascular, mesophyll, and leaf sheath tissues (Hittalmani et al.2016). Infection on the flag leaf sheath can cause emerging lesions that spread to the young panicle. The necrotic lesions may extend to the entire flag leaf sheath, inner stem, and panicle, resulting in sheath rotting and discoloration, empty and sterile grains, and fungal toxin contamination in rice endosperm (Bigirimana Vde et al.2015; Hittalmani et al.2016; Ou et al.2020; Peeters et al.2020).Sarocladium attenuatumandS. oryzaeare two common pathogens of sheath rot in rice fields that can cause 3–85% yield loss per harvest in Taiwan, especially in the second cropping season with high growth temperature (Lin et al.2018; Ou et al.2020).

There is not much information available on rice resistance or susceptibility toSarocladium, which may be partially related to pathogen inoculation. The common inoculation method forSarocladiuminvolves a standard grain inoculum technique or injecting conidial suspension on rice tissues, and disease severity is evaluated on the flag leaf sheath or injected rice tissues 7 days to 1 month after the inoculation (Ngala1983; Peeters et al.2020; Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam1987; Saravanakumar et al.2008). Additionally, a large rice plant, approximately 11-week-old plants at flag leaf stage, is usually required for inoculation. These inoculation methods can lead to some difficulties, such as taking more than 2 months to screen new breeding-resistant varieties. Therefore, developing a technique forSarocladiuminoculation and disease evaluation on seedlings might facilitate a large-scale screening for disease resistance.

Disease resistance breeding is one of the important strategies in disease management in rice. In Taiwan, TNG67 is an imperative variety because it has tolerance to high fertilizer and lodging, resistance to rice blast, and slight resistance to bacterial blight and brown planthopper (Huang1979; Syu et al.2023). These traits make TNG67 frequently used in genome analysis experiments to identify useful functional genes, such as establishing the Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutant (TRIM) library. In the TRIM library, gene functions can be investigated through library screening, followed by the identification of affected gene(s) and then the functional demonstrations of the target genes. In our previous study, a TRIM line (M0050164) was found to be slightly resistant toPythium arrhenomanes. Two genes,LOC_Os09g23084andLOC_Os09g23070, encoding endoglucanase-1 precursor and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, were up-regulated in this TRIM line and might be involved in rice resistance toPythiuminfection (Syu et al.2023). The functions of these two genes have not been characterized yet.

LOC_Os09g23084, also named as Os09g0394300 in RiceXPro, encodes an endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase (EC3.2.1.4) predicted in Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.uga.edu/index.shtml). It belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 9 family (GH9) with cellulose hydrolase activity. Cellulose is a polymer of disaccharide units of D-glucopyranose in a β(1→4) glycosidic linkage and is a key component of the cell wall of plants and oomycetes, such asPythiumspecies.LOC_Os09g23084is located on chromosome 9 of rice. The expression profile ofLOC_Os09g23084shows a relatively broad expression pattern, with high expression in the stem, internode pith parenchyma, whole internode, stigma, and embryo sac (Kundu and Sharma2016). During development, the transcripts ofLOC_Os09g23084are mainly detected in the leaf, panicle, and developing seed (Kundu and Sharma2016). In studies related to plant-pathogen interactions,LOC_Os09g23084expression is associated with rice resistance to the rice blast pathogenMagnaporthe oryzaeand the plant parasitic nematodeHirschmanniella mucronatethrough transcriptomic analysis. In the rice blast-resistant Pi21-RNAi transgenic rice line,LOC_Os09g23084expression is upregulated (Zhang et al.2016). InH. mucronate-resistant and susceptible rice varieties,LOC_Os09g23084(Os09g0394300,OsGH9B11) is highly expressed in the resistant variety (Sun et al.2019). However, the true function ofLOC_Os09g23084in rice development and resistance to biotic and abiotic factors has not been characterized yet.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the function ofLOC_Os09g23084by overexpressing it in the rice variety TNG67 and analyzing the effects of its overexpression on rice development, yield, and disease resistance. After multiple field trials, we found that the overexpression (OE) lines were more susceptible to rice sheath rot. Furthermore, we set up an artificial inoculation system to verify the susceptibility ofLOC_Os09g23084overexpression lines toSarocladiuminfection at the seedling stage. Additionally, overexpressingLOC_Os09g23084affected multiple phenotypes related to plant development, yield, and disease susceptibility to root rot caused byPythium. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the potential function and mechanism ofLOC_Os09g23084in rice susceptibility to sheath rot disease.

The rice varietyOryza sativa Japonicacv Tainung 67 (TNG67) was used in this study to generate gene overexpression lines. TNG67 and transgenic seeds were harvested from the same season for each assay. TRIM lines derived from M0050164 were obtained as indicated by Syu et al. (2023). Seeds were soaked in water for 3–4 days, a process referred to as seed soaking, after surface sterilization as described previously (Syu et al.2023; Tu et al.2023). The soaked seeds were planted in a hydroponic solution for assays as indicated or sowed in a nursery tray for transplanting in a paddy field. Rice lines grown under field conditions were planted with one seedling per planting and 24 plants in a block (3 × 8) per line at the Beigou agricultural experimental farm of the National Chung Hsing University in Taichung City from 2019 to 2022 with two crops per year. The central plants in the block, such as 15 plants (3 × 5) and 18 plants (3 × 6), were used for phenotyping.

The coding region ofLOC_Os09g23084was PCR amplified using primers (Supplementary Table S1) from the cDNA of the homozygous TRIM line 164 H (164-homo) (Syu et al.2023) and cloned into the UMP vector to be driven by the maize ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter (Lee et al.2009) after digestion with SpeI and EcoRV. The construct was transferred into TNG67 viaAgrobacterium-mediated transformation as described previously (Lee et al.2009). To screen the transgenic lines, hygromycin selection was conducted first. The hygromycin selection medium was used to culture the seeds using 1/2 MS selection medium [2.2 g Murashige & Skoog medium (Duchefa, Netherlands), 10 g agar in 1 L H2O] containing 50 ppm Hygromycin. Potential lines were selected for Southern blotting.

Total rice genomic DNA was extracted from the seedling shoots using the CTAB method as described previously (Syu et al.2023). DNA was digested with restriction enzyme SacI or HindIII, and the hygromycin resistance gene was used as the probe. After SacI or HindIII digestion, a single DNA fragment larger than 2412–2457 bp, respectively, would be detected in the single insertion event inLOC_Os09g23084-overexpression lines. The restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA (20 µg) was mixed with a dye solution containing xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue, and separated by 200 ml 8% agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern bolting was conducted as described previously (Kuo et al.2021).

Total RNA was extracted from the rice seedlings using Trizol solution. RNA was converted to cDNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) after treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Promega). Gene expression was analyzed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and the actin gene (LOC_Os03g61970) was used as an internal control. The PCR cocktail contained 2 µl of 10X PCR buffer (Bee Taq buffer), 0.4 µl dNTP (each 10 mM), 0.4 µl forward primer and reverse primer (each 10 µM; Supplementary Table S1), and 0.4 µl Bee Taq DNA polymerase (Fanyuan Co., Taiwan), and sterilized Milli-Q (MQ) water was added to a final volume of 20 µl. PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94 ℃, 28 to 32 cycles of amplification reaction (94 ℃ for 30 s, annealing temperature for 30 s, 72 ℃ for 30 s), and additional extension at 72 ℃ for 7 min. PCR products, 2 µl per sample, were detected by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products amplified from TNG67 cDNA under different cycle numbers were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the optimal number of cycles for unsaturated amplification, as described by Lee et al. (2010). As shown in FigureS1, 32 cycles were selected for semi-quantitative RT-PCR across all tested lines. This method effectively demonstrated significant gene overexpression but did not allow for precise quantification of fold changes in gene expression among the different lines. Therefore, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using the comparative CTmethod was employed to determine the fold change in expression levels, as described previously (Yu et al.2017).

A total of 2.5 g seeds were surface sterilized and placed in a 5.5-cm-diameter petri dish with ten ml reverse osmosis (RO) water for seed-soaking, with the RO water changed every day, for four days (Tu et al.2023). Approximately 100 seeds per replicate with three replicates for each line were investigated in each experiment. Seed germination was categorized into four levels based on shoot and root formation: no shoot or root formation, shoot or root length < 0.7 cm, shoot or root length between 0.7 and 1.4 cm, and shoot or root length > 1.4 cm.

To measure seedling growth, water-soaked seeds were grown in a hydroponic system with 5 seedlings per well and 3 replicates per line (Syu et al.2023). The shoot and root lengths of 10-day-old seedlings were measured using ImageJ.

Several diseases were commonly observed in the field, such as sheath rot, sheath blight disease, rice blast, brown spot, and white panicle damaged by pink stem borer or rice stem borer. Therefore, these naturally occurring diseases in the fields were investigated during harvest for five cropping seasons from 2019 to 2021. A total of 15 plants per line were investigated in a cropping season for each disease.

where N is the total number of plants in each rating scale, Nt is the total number of plants, and Snis the total rating scale. The brown spot was recorded using disease scales as follows: scale 0 for 1 to 3 lesions, scale 1 for 4 to 15 lesions, and scale 2 for more than 15 lesions shown on the flag leaves of each examined plant. The disease severity index of brown spot was calculated using the same formula as that used for panicle blast.

Rice plant height was measured at the tillering stage from 2019 to 2021. The tallest rice tiller per plant and 18 plants per line were measured. The length of the internode, panicle, and panicle neck was measured during harvest. The thickest and central position stalk of each plant was selected to calculate the length, with 15 plants per rice line. Tiller numbers, panicle numbers, and grain weight per plant were counted. The panicle length was measured from the base of the panicle to the first internode. The panicle neck length was measured from the panicle base to the top of the flag leaf sheath. At least 15 plants per line were detected in each cropping season. Grains were collected and dried at 37 ℃ for 1 week in an oven. The mean of grain weight per plant from four cropping seasons (2019-I, 2020-I, 2020-II, and 2021-I) in each line was then calculated and presented.

Rice tissues were embedded in 3–4% agarose and sliced into 40 μm sections using a Microslicer (DTK-1000 N, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan) with three to five plants per line. At least two sections from each line were used for vascular size measurement or staining assay. The size of the vascular bundles was measured using ImageJ software. For lignin analysis, a phloroglucinol-HCl staining method was employed, as previously described by Weng et al. (2010). The sections were stained with a solution containing 1% phloroglucinol (w/v) in 12% HCl for 5 min and subsequently examined under a microscope. For cellulose staining, the Calcofluor White staining was utilized, following the procedure described by Ursache et al. (2018). The sections were treated with 0.1% Calcofluor White for 15 min, followed by a gentle wash with MQ water. Staining observations were conducted using an excitation wavelength of 405–445 nm and emission detection at 430–490 nm. Lignin content was quantified based on color intensity, measured using the Histogram function in ImageJ. The brightness levels obtained from the histogram were used as an indicator of lignin abundance. Darker red coloration, corresponding to higher lignin content, produced lower intensity values, while brighter regions with lower lignin content yielded higher intensity values. The average histogram intensity was used as a proxy for relative lignin levels.

The endo-1,4-β-glucanase activity was determined using the Cellulase Assay Kit (Megazyme, Ireland) with the CellG5 method (Mangan et al.2016). Leaves from 3- or 21-day-old rice seedlings were used for enzyme activity detection following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, leaves collected from ten seedlings per line were grounded into powder in liquid nitrogen and a 100-mg powder was used for the assay. A standard curve for endo-1,4-β-glucanase was created using a known enzymatic unit ofTrichodermacellulase provided in the kit. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).

The glucanase activity of germinated seeds was assessed following the method described by Horvath et al. (2000) with modifications. Seeds were germinated for 72 h, heated for 1 h at 45℃, cut in half, and placed endosperm-side down on Murashige-Skoog medium containing 2 g/L carboxylmethyl cellulose, then incubated at 37℃ for 24 h. The zymogram was developed after staining with 0.2% Congo red for 30 min and de-staining in 1 M NaCl solution for 5 min. Five seeds per line were used in the assay and the sizes of clear zones were measured using ImageJ.

P. arrhenomanesinoculation and disease severity assay were conducted as described previously (Syu et al.2023). Seeds harvested from 2019 to 2021 were used. In each experiment, five seedlings per inoculation and three inoculations per line were conducted.

Sarocladium oryzaestrain SA3-8, provided by Dr. Chi-yu Chen, Dept. of Plant Pathology, National Chung Hsing University, was isolated from a diseased rice plant (Ou et al.2020). Conidia collected from the SA3-8 colony grown on PDA for 2 weeks were resuspended in water and filtered through a layer of miracloth (MERCK). The suspension was adjusted to 2 × 106and 2 × 107spores/ml for leaf-cutting inoculation on rice leaves of seedlings that were 3 weeks old. Rice leaf tips were cut off with sterile scissors to remain 2 to 3 cm long, and the cut surface was soaked in the spore suspension or sterilized water for 10 min. The seedlings were kept in a moist environment for 1 week. The lesion length was measured using ImageJ. Seeds harvested from 2020 to 2021 were used in this experiment, and 15 seedlings per line were inoculated. The lesion length was measured from the cut side (the inoculation site) to the lesion margin, which was confirmed withS. oryzaecolonization assay as mentioned below.

The GFP-taggedS. oryzaestrains were generated using theAgrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transformation method to transfer plasmid p1300-CT74(F) intoS. oryzaestrain SA3-8, as described previously (Kuo et al.2021). The generated SA3-8 GFP1 and SA3-8 GFP2 strains were selected to verifyS. oryzaecolonization on the inoculated leaf using the leaf-cutting inoculation method.

The colonization ofS. oryzaeon the inoculated leaves was assayed. After inoculation for 7 days, the leaves were collected and fungal colonization was detected by microscopic examination and by cultivating leaf fragments on water agar (WA). For microscopic examination, the inoculated leaves were sliced, and examined for fungal hyphal colonization under a fluorescence microscope. For cultivation on WA, the inoculated leaves were sterilized in 75% ethanol for 1 min, then in 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, and washed three times with sterilized RO water. The sterilized leaf was cut into small pieces with 2 mm in length starting from the inoculation site. These pieces were then placed sequentially on WA containing 10 ppm chloramphenicol. Hyphae grown out from the leaf pieces were examined under a dissecting microscope. Rice leaf pieces colonized withS. oryzaehyphae were used to confirm the colonization distance (lesion length) from the inoculation site to the lesion margin in each leaf. All inoculated leaves were assayed forS. oryzaecolonization.

Statistical Package for Social Science software, version 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics 20) was used for data analysis. The significance of the difference between the OE line and its segregated wild-type line was determined by the Independent Student’st-test between the two groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan test (P< 0.05) was used to identify differences between more than two groups. All experiments were performed at least twice. Data were presented with sinaplot and boxplot using ggplot2 and ggforce packages or presented with means and their associated standard deviations.

LOC_Os09g23084andOs09g0394300are the same genes reported in two different databases, the Rice Genome Annotation Project and RiceXPro, respectively. However, the two genes are indicated with different sizes of the coding region and generate protein sizes of 441 amino acids and 556 amino acids, respectively. A 115-amino acid region was missed in the N-terminus ofOs09g0394300(Gene symbol LOC4346968 in NCBI). Therefore, we amplified the 5’ region of the cDNA generated from this gene for sequencing to verify whether the 115 amino acids are present in the LOC_Os09g23084 of TNG67. Our data showed thatLOC_Os09g23084of TNG67 carries the additional 115 amino acids at the N-terminus. The CDS length ofLOC_Os09g23084is 1671-bp made up of three exons in TNG67 (Fig.1A). Analysis of the protein sequence using Interpro indicates thatLOC_Os09g23084encodes an endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase, containing a secreted signal peptide at the N-terminus and a GH9 domain at the C-terminus.

The cDNA ofLOC_Os09g23084amplified from TNG67 was cloned under the control of the Ubi promoter to generate overexpression transgenic lines. A total of 32 transgenic lines were generated. Hygromycin selection medium and Southern blotting were used to identify theLOC_Os09g23084overexpression homozygous (OE) and segregated wild-type (sWT) lines. Southern blotting identified single T-DNA insertion homozygous OE lines 1–16 S and 4–10 S and their associated sWT lines 1–11 sWT and 4–6 sWT, respectively (Fig.1B). The single band size of 1–16 S was different from 4–10 S, indicating that they are two independent homozygous lines with T-DNA insertion in different positions. Therefore, they were selected for further analysis.

The expression ofLOC_Os09g23084was detected using semi-q-RT-PCR, and the data from two independent experiments were showed in Supplementary Figure S1. The results revealed that 1–16 S and 4–10 S exhibited significantly higherLOC_Os09g23084expression levels than TNG67 and their sWT lines. In addition, gene expression levels were further quantified using qRT-PCR (Fig.1C). The data verified the overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084in the OE lines 1–16 S and 4–10 S. In addition, the mRNA level ofLOC_Os09g23084was significantly higher in the OE lines than in theLOC_Os09g23084-activated homozygous TRIM line 164-homo (164 H) (Fig.1C and Supplementary Figure S1).

Seed germination ability was assayed by measuring the length of the embryonic shoot and root after seed soaking. All rice lines had no significant differences in the percentage of seeds without root formation, indicating that their germination abilities are similar. However, the OE lines showed significant differences in root development. Compared to the sWT lines, the OE lines have a higher percentage of seeds with root lengths shorter than 0.7 cm and a lower percentage of seeds with root lengths longer than 1.4 cm (Fig.2A), indicating that root growth was inhibited in the OE lines. There was no significant difference in shoot development between the OE lines and their sWT lines (Fig.2B). In 10-day-old seedlings, the two OE lines had shorter shoot and root lengths than TNG67 and their sWT lines, but the difference was not found in theLOC_Os09g23084-activated homozygous TRIM line 164 H (Supplementary Figure S2A).

The OE lines also showed a significant delay in growth in field conditions. In the nursery tray, the OE lines showed shorter plant height than TNG67 and their sWT lines (Supplementary Figure S2B). In the paddy fields, the growth and panicle development of the OE lines were noticeably delayed compared to those of the wild-type lines (Fig.3A). The plant height of the two OE lines was shorter than their sWT lines and TNG67 at the tillering stage(Fig.3B), indicating that the OE lines had delayed growth compared to the sWT lines.

To understand ifLOC_Os09g23084overexpression affects rice production, grain weight per plant was calculated from four harvest seasons from 2019 to 2021 (Fig.3C). OE lines had significantly less grain weight per rice plant than their sWT line and TNG67, but no difference in tiller numbers per plant was found. OE line 1–16 S decreased by 30.8% in grain weight per plant compared to TNG67 and by 33.4% compared to 1–11 sWT; OE line 4–10 S decreased by 21.7% compared to TNG67 and decreased by 26.3% compared to 4–6 sWT.

LOC_Os09g23084exhibits high expression in the internode pith parenchyma, whole internode, and stigma of rice plants (Kundu and Sharma2016). To investigate the impact ofLOC_Os09g23084overexpression on rice internode development, the lengths of different internodes at the mature stage were measured. The length of the first internode (the uppermost internode; IN1) in the OE lines was found to be significantly shorter compared to their sWT lines (Fig.4A). No consistent differences were found between OE lines and their corresponding sWT lines in the lengths of the second internode (IN2), the third internode (IN3), and the panicle. In addition, the panicle neck of the OE lines was frequently covered with the flag leaf sheath. The panicle neck length, from the panicle base to the top of the flag leaf sheath, of the OE lines was significantly shorter than that of the TNG67 and sWT lines (Fig.4B).

The cross-section analysis of IN1 revealed a significantly lower level of protrusion of peripheral vascular bundles in OE lines compared to the wild-type lines (Fig.5A). Additionally, a distinct difference was observed in the shape of the vascular bundle between the OE lines and wild-type lines. The OE lines exhibited longer inner vascular bundles and shorter peripheral vascular bundles compared to wild-type lines (Fig.5B). The length-to-width ratio of the vascular bundle was calculated, and the data demonstrated that LOC_Os09g23084 OE lines had a significantly lower length-to-width ratio of peripheral vascular bundles and a higher length-to-width ratio of inner vascular bundles compared to the WT lines (Fig.5C).

The cellulose and lignin content of IN1 were measured. No differences in cellulose content were observed between the OE lines and their sWT lines (Fig.6A). However, lignin contents appeared to be lower in the OE lines than in their sWT lines (Fig.6B). For lignin content, the red color intensity was measured in vascular bundles and sclerenchyma cells. Higher intensity (brightness) indicates a blighter red color, indicating lower lignin content. In contrast, lower intensity (brightness) represents a darker red color, indicating higher lignin content. As shown in Fig.6C, the OE line had significantly lower lignin contents than their sWT lines, especially in vascular bundles.

In field conditions, five rice diseases were commonly observed. Throughout five cropping seasons from 2019 to 2021, severe sheath rot disease was observed in the OE lines (Fig.7and Supplementary Figure S3). This disease often occurred on the flag leaf sheath (Fig.7A). It could reduce grain quality and cause grains to become discolored especially when the infected flag leaf sheath covered the panicle (indicated by red arrows in Fig.7A). Representative data on disease incidence from the 2021-II crop are shown in Fig.7B. The incidence of sheath rot disease in the OE lines was significantly higher than that in TNG67 and their corresponding sWT lines in each season (Supplementary Figure S3). The average disease incidence from the five harvests was 17.66% and 1.63% for 1–16 S and 1–11 sWT lines, respectively, 12.32% and 1.11% for 4–10 S and 4–6 sWT lines, respectively, and 1.50% for TNG67 (Fig.7C).

Additionally, four other diseases, namely sheath blight, rice blast, brown spot, and white head caused by stem borers, were investigated over two seasons. However, no associations were observed betweenLOC_Os09g23084overexpression and disease severity or incidence for these four diseases (Supplementary Table S2).

To confirm the observations that OE lines were more susceptible to sheath rot disease in field conditions, an in-vitro inoculation assay was set up. The inoculation with a spore suspension of 2 × 107spores/ml caused necrosis on the cutting edge of TNG67 at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi). The early symptom was browning that developed along the leaf veins at the cutting edge at 3 dpi (central panel in Fig.8A). On the cutting surface, mycelia grew out from the infected veins (indicated with an arrow in the bottom panel of Fig.8A). Almost all vascular bundles of the pathogen-treated leaf had turned brown color, which was not observed in the control leaf (Fig.8B). The lesion length was used as a measurement to detect the susceptibility of rice lines toS. oryzae. By 7 dpi, the necrotic lesion expended and became measurable (Fig.8C). However, some small leaves after cutting could wilt (marked with a white arrow in Fig.8C), which was not highly distinguishable from the long necrotic lesion examined with the naked eye. Therefore, the lesion length was verified with mycelium growth on water agar (marked with yellow lines on the agar plates in Fig.8D). The lesion length of OE line 1–16 S was significantly longer than that of 1–11 sWT and TNG67. The OE line 4–10 S also showed larger lesions than 4–6 sWT (Fig.8E).

The pathogen colonization of the inoculated leaves was also confirmed by a GFP-tagged transformant. Mycelial growth from the infection site was observed under a microscope. GFP fluorescence of this transformant was observed in the infected leaf on water agar under a fluorescent microscope (Fig.7F).

TheLOC_Os09g23084activated TRIM line M0050164 of TNG67 was shown to slightly increase resistance to the rice seedling damping-off pathogenPythium arrhenomanes(Syu et al.2023). Therefore, theLOC_Os09g23084OE lines were assayed for their resistance toP. arrhenomanesinoculation. The reduction percentage of primary root length in thePythiumtreatment compared to that in the water treatment was used to evaluate the disease severity ofPythiuminfection. No consistently significant difference was found between the OE and the wild-type lines in multiple independent inoculation assays. The data from two independent inoculation assays using seeds collected from 2020-I and 2021-I were presented (Supplementary Figure S4).

TheLOC_Os09g23084-activated homozygous TRIM line 164 H expressedLOC_Os09g23084mRNA at a lower level than the OE lines and a higher level than the wild-type lines (Fig.1C and Supplementary Figure S1). Compared to the wild-type lines,LOC_Os09g23084-activated TRIM line 164 H did not show a significant difference in seedling growth, plant height, and grain yield (Supplementary Figure S2; Syu et al.2023) as well as the length of internode, panicle, and panicle neck (Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). In addition, no significant difference in sheath rot incidence was detected inLOC_Os09g23084-activated TRIM line 164 H compared to the wild-type lines (Supplementary Figure S7).

Total endoglucanase activity was detected using the CellG5 method. OE lines showed slightly higher enzyme activity than their sWT in 3-day-old seedlings, but the difference was not detected in 21-day-old seedlings. By Congo red staining, the embryos of OE lines showed slightly higher cellulase activity compared to their sWT lines and TNG67 (Supplementary Figure S8).

Various rice diseases occurred in the field causing severe yield loss, and potentially leading to a food crisis worldwide. Rice breeding for disease resistance is a crucial approach to reduce this loss. By screening the TRIM library for disease resistance toPythium, one line with two up-regulated rice genes showed slight resistance toPythium arrhenomanes(Syu et al.2023). However, the function of these two genes has not been characterized. In this study, we overexpressed one of these genes,LOC_Os09g23084, in rice to analyze its function. We found that overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084resulted in increased susceptibility to sheath rot disease and decreased development, including delayed maturation, reduced internode length, deformed vascular bundles, reduced lignin content, and decreased yield. Artificial inoculation demonstrated the increased susceptibility of the OE lines to the sheath rot pathogen. The deformed vascular bundles and low lignin content might contribute to the susceptibility to sheath rot.

Plant cellulases, primarily endoglucanases, are classified in the GH9 family. This family is further divided into three structure subclasses (A, B, C) based on the presence of transmembrane domains, the signal peptide, and the carbohydrate-binding module CBM49, in which only subclass A contains transmembrane domains (Urbanowicz et al.2007). Twenty-five riceGH9genes (OsGH9) have been classified according to this domain presence classification, withLOC_Os09g23084annotated as GH9B11 based on the nomenclature of the GH9 family inArabidopsis(Xie et al.2013). In the same year, Kundu and Sharma annotatedLOC_Os09g23084as a member of the GH9C group using ANN predictor, which is based on machine learning with sequence features and 3D structures. Endoglucanases play roles in cellulose biosynthesis and degradation, as well as in modifying the association of cellulose microfibrils with other wall polysaccharides, or in wall loosening during cell elongation (Perrot et al.2022). Therefore, theOsGH9gene family is likely to play roles in rice growth and development. Two membrane-bound endoglucanase genes,OSGLU1andOSGLU3, are known to be involved in plant growth.OSGLU1affects plant internode elongation (Zhou et al.2006), whileOSGLU3is required for root cell elongation and division in rice (Zhang et al.2012). Functional studies ofOsGH9genes are primarily related to biofuel production (Huang et al.2017; Huang et al.2019; Nigorikawa et al.2012; Sharma et al.2013; Xie et al.2013). For example, the overexpression of rice exoglucanase EXG1 leads to various abnormalities in leaves and enhanced saccharification of rice straws (Nigorikawa et al.2012). Additionally, overexpressing twoOSGH9genes (OsGH9B1andOsGH9B3) enhances saccharification and increases bioethanol production, with a slight impact on plant growth (Huang et al.2019). In this study, overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084influenced root and shoot elongation during plant growth. The slow growth appeared to delay the maturation of rice and affect grain yields.LOC_Os09g23084was found to be expressed at a moderate level in roots and old stems, and at a relatively high level in young stems, mature leaves, internodes, radicles, embryosacs, and endosperm (Kundu and Sharma2016; Xie et al.2013), which correlates with the phenotypes observed in the overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084. Overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084inhibited root growth during seed germination and seedling growth, as well as shoot and internode growth at the seedling and vegetative stages, respectively. However, compared to the wild-type lines, theLOC_Os09g23084-activated TRIM mutant 164 H did not show differences in root and shoot growth at the seedling stage or in plant growth in the field, indicating that the growth retardation of OE lines is likely caused by the constitutive overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084.

The internodes of rice plants do not elongate significantly during vegetative growth. Elongation of internodes begins during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, allowing the panicle formed at the stem apex to be pushed upward (Hirao et al.2001; Nagai and Ashikari2023). In this study, we observed that the OE lines showed retardation in the growth of the first internode (IN1), resulting in the panicle neck being almost fully covered by the flag leaf sheath. This phenomenon might affect grain production and the occurrence of sheath rot (see below).LOC_Os09g23084is highly expressed in the internode pith parenchyma, whole internode, and stem (Kundu and Sharma2016; Xie et al.2013). Consistent with these expression patterns, our data demonstrate thatLOC_Os09g23084overexpression plays an important role in internode elongation. Genes such asOsGLU1, phosphatidylserine synthase, and gibberellins homeostasis are involved in culm development and internode length in rice (Ma et al.2016; Wang et al.2017; Zhao et al.2021; Zhou et al.2006). In addition toOsGLU1,LOC_Os09g23084might be the secondOsGH9gene found to be involved in internode elongation in rice.

OverexpressingLOC_Os09g23084affects vascular bundle development and causes deformation of peripheral and inner vascular bundles. Additionally, it results in a decrease in lignin content but no significant change in cellulose content. These changes may be related to long-term alterations in cell wall construction in the OE lines. Lignin content can impact the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials, thereby affecting cell wall construction and reconstruction (Phakeenuya et al.2020). The protrusion level of the peripheral vascular bundle of IN1 is less pronounced in the OE lines, which may lead to changes in the shapes of both the peripheral and inner vascular bundles in the OE lines. The loss-of-function ofOSH15, a member of the knotted1-type homeobox gene family, and the overexpression ofOsOFP, a transcription factor of Ovate Family Protein, have been shown to alter the arrangement of rice vascular bundles (Sato et al.1999; Schmitz et al.2015). The positioning of vascular bundles might be influenced by the presence of capped sclerenchyma fibers and the composition of lignin in the cell wall (Marcelo et al.2017).

Rice cell wall composition plays a potential role in determining the degree of horizontal resistance to the rice sheath rot pathogenSarocladium(Joe and Manibhushanrao1995; Mvuyekure et al.2017; Zhang et al.2021).Sarocladiumsecretes cell wall-degrading enzymes and toxins to colonize hosts (Manibhushanrao et al.1986; Pearce et al.2001; Peeters et al.2020; Sakthivel et al.2002). In this study, we observed that the cell wall composition of the OE lines differs from the wild-type, with lower lignin in the OE lines. The lower lignin content might contribute to the higher susceptibility of the OE lines toSarocladium. Lignin is crucial for the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials and then may influence the infection ofSarocladium. In addition to lignin contents, the lower protrusion level of the internode vascular bundle and the coverage of the panicle neck with the flag leaf sheath also contribute to the susceptibility of the OE lines to sheath rot. Sheath rot lesions are commonly found on sheaths covering IN1, and infection of IN1 can lead to the abortion of emerging panicles and the development of unfilled grains (Bigirimana Vde et al.2015; Ou et al.2020; Sakthivel et al.2002). In the field, rice sheath rot disease is mainly transmitted by the tarsonemid mite (Steneotarsonemus spinkiSmiley) (Ayyadurai et al.2005). The female mite is 222–350 μm in length and 84–108 μm in width, while the male mite is 217–244 μm in length and 109–122 μm in width (Hummel et al.2009; Kayal et al.2021). Their bodies are larger but their cheliceral stylets are much shorter than the protruded vascular bundles, which might affect their efficacy in injecting the epidermis of rice tissues. Overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084results in less protruding vascular bundles that might increase the injection efficacy of mites into the rice tissues and subsequently enhance the transmission of the pathogen, thereby increasing disease incidence.

Sarocladiumrequires wounds and stomata to enter rice, and all growth stages of rice can be infected by the sheath rot pathogen (Peeters et al.2021). The typical inoculation method forSarocladiumspecies involves injecting a spore suspension into the flag leaf sheath or the stem, with a limitation on plant age of 11 weeks (Ngala1983; Ou et al.2020; Saravanakumar et al.2008). Lesions caused by this method appear as oblong or irregular spots (Bigirimana Vde et al.2015; Peeters et al.2020). Besides, this method takes over 7 days for a lesion to appear and 14 days to develop a large lesion for evaluation, making it challenging to rapidly estimate disease severity. In this study, a leaf-cutting method using seedlings as inoculation materials was developed. This method significantly reduces rice cultivation time and avoids irregular lesion formation. However, a drawback of this method was identified that some leaf slices with yellowing and necrosis symptoms were not colonized by the pathogen. This could be due to the young seedling leaf being more susceptible to the toxins produced bySarocladium oryzaeor to the wounding caused by cutting damage.S. oryzaecan produce toxins during rice infection (Bigirimana Vde et al.2015; Peeters et al.2020,2021). Using this inoculation method, the growth time of rice for inoculation can be largely reduced from 11 weeks to 3 weeks, which is important for rice breeding for resistance to sheath rot disease.

In a previous study, theLOC_Os09g23084-activated TRIM line was shown to be slightly resistant toP. arrhenomanes(Syu et al.2023). However, theLOC_Os09g23084OE lines in this study were not resistant toPythium. One reason for this discrepancy may be the poor root growth ability in the OE lines. Our data indicate that cellulase activity is elevated in the germinated seeds of the OE lines, which may facilitate shoot emergency and elongation but adversely affect root growth.P. arrhenomanesprimarily attacks young roots and germinated seeds with longer embryonic roots exhibit greater resistance toPythiuminfection (Chun and Schneider1998; Syu et al.2023; Toda et al.2015). Faster-growing roots might have a shorter susceptibility period to the infection ofPythiuminfection (Chun and Schneider1998; Syu et al.2023; Tu et al.2023). Shorter roots were observed in the seedlings of OE lines, which could contribute to their susceptibility toPythiuminfection. It is possible that the constitutive overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084inhibits embryotic root development and then influences the susceptibility of the OE lines toP. arrhenomanes. The overexpression lines exhibit significantly higher levels ofLOC_Os09g23084expression compared to theLOC_Os09g23084-activated TRIM line (164-Homo in Fig.1C), which may differentially affect root development processes, such as primary root elongation and cell wall modification, and consequently lead to varying levels of susceptibility toPythiuminfection. The function ofLOC_Os09g23084in the slight resistance of theLOC_Os09g23084-activated TRIM line toP. arrhenomanesremains unclear.

Gene silencing or knockout approaches, such as RNA interference (RNAi) or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, are widely used for functional characterization of genes. However, several limitations must be considered when applying these techniques. LOC_Os09g23084 is a member of a large gene family, raising the possibility of off-target effects and functional redundancy. In RNAi-based silencing, incomplete knockdown may result in residual gene expression, complicating phenotypic interpretation. Similarly, CRISPR/Cas9 may generate off-target mutations or fail to fully eliminate gene function due to compensatory expression from homologs. In this study, we employed a gene overexpression strategy to investigate the potential function of LOC_Os09g23084. While this approach revealed phenotypic consequences associated with elevated expression, it does not allow us to determine whether LOC_Os09g23084 is strictly required for these phenotypes. Further reverse-genetics analyses, such as precise knockout and complementation studies, are needed to establish its necessity in these biological processes.

Plant susceptibility to pathogen attack can result from multiple biochemical and structural factors. These include impaired pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) due to ineffective recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), weakened effector-triggered immunity (ETI) caused by the absence or dysfunction of resistance (R) genes, disrupted hormonal signaling and inappropriate hormone crosstalk, activation of susceptibility (S) genes, insufficient reinforcement of the cell wall, limited capacity to detoxify pathogen-derived toxins, accumulation of metabolites that favor pathogen proliferation, and suppression of host defense compound biosynthesis and pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression (Dong and Ronald2019; Gorshkov and Tsers2022; Lapin and Van den Ackerveken2013; Miedes et al.2014; Van Esse et al.2020). Additionally, modifications to cell wall structure can affect plant immunity triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which include molecules released from the plant cell wall (e.g. wall-derived glycans) and peptides (Bacete et al.2018; Souza et al.2017). In the present study, we show that constitutive overexpression ofLOC_Os09g23084significantly increases susceptibility to sheath rot disease in rice. This phenotype is accompanied by developmental alterations, including reduced internode and panicle neck length, diminished protrusion of peripheral vascular bundles, and decreased lignin accumulation, all of which may compromise physical barriers against fungal invasion. Regarding the biochemical analysis, the OE lines exhibited higher cellulase activity in germinated seeds but did not show significantly elevated activity in larger seedling. Variability in the observed total cellulase activity may be attributed to the enzymatic assay method, the developmental stage of the sampled plants, and the complexity of the cellulase gene family in rice. To further elucidate the underlying biochemical mechanisms, additional targeted analyses are warranted. These includes comprehensive analysis of cell wall composition in the flag leaf sheath and first internode, quantification of fungal toxin accumulation at infection sites, assessment of toxin detoxification responses in infected plants, evaluation of antimicrobial compound production, expression profiling of genes involved in cellulose and lignin metabolism as well as defense-related genes, and characterization of immune signaling pathways. Collectively, these investigations may provide mechanistic insight into howLOC_Os09g23084modulates the rice immune landscape and facilitates fungal pathogenesis.
