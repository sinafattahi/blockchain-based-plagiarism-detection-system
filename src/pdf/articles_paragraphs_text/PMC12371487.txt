The present study investigates the potential anti-infective
and
antibacterial properties of phenylalkyl acetophenones and anacardic
acids isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the leaves of Knema
oblongifolia, along with synthetic derivatives that were generated.
As antibiotic resistance grows, the discovery of new anti-infective
agents becomes crucial. The study utilizes a phenotypic screening
approach, employing a 3R infection model with (Mm) and (Dd) as proxies for and human macrophages. This model helps to distinguish between general
antibiotics and specific anti-infectives that inhibit bacterial growth
inside host cells. A previous screening carried out on a collection
of 1600 plant natural extracts revealed as a significant source of anti-infective compounds. The ethyl acetate
extract of this plant exhibited a strong inhibition of Mm intracellular
growth in the infection model while minimally affecting bacterial
growth in broth. HPLC bioactivity profiling of this extract based
on a high-resolution microfractionation strategy uncovered that the
activity was associated with different LC-peaks spread over the chromatogram.
LC–MS-based metabolite profiling of the extract revealed that
they shared common substructural elements. Based on such information,
fractionation of the extract at a larger scale led to the isolation
of 12 bioactive natural products (NPs): four newly described acetophenone
NPs and eight salicylic acid derivatives (three of which were new).
These NPs were further tested for their activities against Mm (antibacterial
and anti-infective), , and . Additionally,
the study involved de novo synthesis of derivatives based on the backbones
of the isolated acetophenones to enhance their bioactivity. Hemisynthesis
on one of the isolated natural acetophenone was also carried out and
resulted in an increase in potency but no increase in selectivity
toward the inhibition of Mm intracellular growth. Overall, biological
activity assessments revealed that some of the synthetic analogues
generated were better candidates in terms of both selectivity and
potency, with an improved activity profile compared to natural analogues.
The best synthetic candidate reached an IC50of 0.59 μM
for the inhibition of intracellular bacterial growth during infection
(anti-infective activity).

Antibiotics have had a paradigm-changing
impact on medicine since
their discovery in the middle of the 20th century, saving innumerable
human lives since their introduction into commercial use. Yet, the efficacy of those “magic bullets”
has been gradually eroded due to overconsumption and injudicious use
in clinical contexts. While their effects have largely been taken
for granted by the public, this hides a looming threat in the emergence
of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR) bacterial
pathogens. It was estimated that by 2050, about 10 million people
each year would be dying from antibiotic-resistant infections, which
would make it the largest cause of death globally.,One
bacterial pathogen that is particularly worrying for the future of
antibiotic treatments is (Mtb), with an estimated death toll of 1.3 million people as of
2022.

Historically natural products
(NPs) have been a rich source of
chemical diversity, with about 50% of all drugs approved in the past
four decades having been derived from nature. Several methods, mostly phenotypic-based, have been established
to assess antimicrobial activities of NPs, notably disk well diffusion,
agar dilution, or broth dilution, to name a few. The era of target-based drug discovery, which started in
the 1990s, has generally failed to deliver significant progress in
the discovery of antimicrobials. Phenotypic screening approaches have
therefore returned to fashion recently, especially as they increasingly
enable the discovery of new targets.−This renewed attention
toward phenotypic screening was enabled by the development of more
complex and specific phenotypic models, notably models which capture
the intracellular nature of Mtb’s pathogenicity.,In the current study, a 3R-infection model that mimics the behavior
of Mtb when it infects human macrophages was established, using (Mm, ATCC BAA-535) and (Dd, ATCC MYA-4120), respectively,
as stand-ins for Mtb and macrophages.−The goal of this assay
is to find “anti-infective” samples that would affect
only the growth of the bacteria in the infection model and would therefore
be less prone to resistance mechanisms. To distinguish between anti-infectives
and antibiotics, a second assay where Mm was cultured in broth was
carried out.

This approach also
provided a double readout on the growth of both
the bacteria and the amoeba, making it possible to distinguish between
“strict anti-infectives” (only inhibiting bacterial
growth in infection) and “anti-infective Dd inhibitors”
(inhibiting the growth of both bacteria and amoeba).

In addition to stringent biological assays, it is
also crucial
to have access to a large source of chemical diversity to tackle the
challenges of antibiotics resistance. For this, an internal collection
of 1600 registered Natural plant Extracts (NEs) previously described,
which contains species that encompass about 30% of all known botanical
families, was screened for anti-infective
activities with the Dd-Mm anti-infective assay.,Based on that screening, this work focused on the phytochemical
investigation of the ethyl acetate extract ofKnema oblongifolia(King) Warb., Myristicaceae (leaves), which was highlighted as a
strong anti-infective. The aim was then to identify its active principles,
obtain a series of structurally related natural and synthetic derivatives,
characterize their activities, and determine structural features possibly
responsible for the observed activity.

The investigation included
high-resolution bioactivity profiling
to target bioactive compounds, large-scale isolation of anti-infective
entities, and synthetic derivatization of the backbone of some of
the identified NPs. In addition to the anti-infective potency assessment
of the isolated NPs, antibacterial assays on one strain of (Sa, Gram-positive) and one strain of (Pa, Gram-negative),were also carried out to assess general antibacterial activities
and contextualize them with the antimycobacterial activities.

The biological screening,of a 1600 NE collection
previously described initiated this study.
For this, a model based on the infection of the amoeba host Dd by
Mm was used.,Two readouts were obtained from
this anti-infective assay: “anti-infectives” were the
samples that reduced the growth of Mm by at least 50% during infection,
while “Dd inhibitors” were those that reduced the growth
of Dd by at least 50%. A second assay to assess the antibiotic activity
of samples was also carried out with Mm grown in broth (without any
host). This approach allowed for the discrimination of antibiotics
from anti-infectives, with the latter acting predominantly during
infection. NEs were therefore considered hits if they were anti-infectives
but not antibiotic. Extracts classified as “anti-infective
Dd inhibitors” were also considered hits, despite the ideal
scenario being that of “strict anti-infectives”. Indeed,
components responsible for the anti-infective effect in an extract
might not necessarily be the same as those responsible for inhibiting
the growth of the amoeba.

Among the hit extracts that this screening
yielded, the ethyl acetate extract of leaves (King) Warb., Myristicaceae (Q5438126) was one of the anti-infective
Dd inhibitors with a striking anti-infective activity but also affecting
the growth of the amoeba. To our knowledge, no phytochemical investigations
were reported for this species at the time of writing (see WikiData
query), it was therefore chosen as the focus of the current study.

The ethyl acetate extract of leaves strikingly inhibited (by 155%)
the intracellular growth of Mm during infection compared to the DMSO
control (FigureC,D)
while leaving the bacteria almost unaffected in broth (FigureA,B). Note that a growth inhibition
of over 100% effectively corresponds to a reduction of the initial
Mm load present inside Dd at the start of the infection, which means
that the extract is bactericidal. The extract also decreased the cell
mass of the amoeba compared to the initial value, which indicates
cytotoxicity (FigureE,F). Despite the latter “red flag”, the extract was
nevertheless considered for further study because it exerted selective
anti-infective activity without activity against the bacteria in broth.
The hope was also for the anti-infective and the cytotoxic activity
to be disentangled during fractionation.

tested at 25 μg/mL. 50% growth inhibition is the threshold (represented
by a dotted line in B, D, and F) set for a NE to be considered bioactive
in each respective category. The dotted lines in panels A, C, and
E represent the median of luminescence/fluorescence of all wells at
time 0. Each experiment was carried out in 3 biological replicates,
1 technical replicate.

In order to disentangle the activities of the
various NPs in the extract, an HPLC bioactivity profiling method was used to monitor the activity on the Dd-Mm
model. For this, the extract was subjected to generic metabolite profiling
by UHPLC-PDA-CAD-HRMS/MS. The UV-PDA trace revealed that the extract
was rich in UV-active NPs. The Charged Aerosol Detection (CAD) trace,
which is known to provide a semiquantitative readout, revealed that
it fitted well with the UV trace at 329 nm. Indeed, for almost all
CAD-detected peaks, a proportional UV peak was detected, UV detection
was therefore well adapted to study this plant extract (Supporting InformationFigure 1).

Dereplication
based on tandem MS spectra (MS2) recorded by data-dependent
analysis using the computational MS framework software SIRIUS was largely inconclusive.

The HPLC bioactivity
profiling was done by a microfractionation
into a 96-well plate in a single chromatographic run on an aliquot
of 13 mg. Individual microfractions were dried, all diluted in a conserved
volume, and tested for anti-infective activities. Following the color
patterns established inFigure, individual values for bacterial growth in infection for
each microfraction are displayed in red on the chromatogram, the growth
of the amoeba in green, and the bacterial growth in broth in purple
(Figure).

that were tested for their anti-infective activities in infection
(in red), their effect on the host in infection (in green) as well
as antibiotic activitiesin broth(in purple) with
3 biological replicates, and 1 technical replicate for each experiment.
Ten zones (hit microfractions) with distinctm/zvalues detected and with inhibitory activities above 50%
can be observed. Two more microfractions with distinctm/zvalues and inhibitory activities close to 50%
(but not above) were also considered hits (M08 and M31). The 30 min
chromatogram was truncated between 0 and 21 min to focus on bioactive
regions.

A total of 16 microfractions (M) among
the 92 collected
from the EtOAc extract of displayed over 50% inhibition of intracellular bacterial growth
and were flagged as anti-infective. Subsequent UHPLC-PDA-CAD-HRMS/MS
analyses of these microfractions and adjacent ones revealed 12 distinct
target [M-H]−MS features (m/z@ RT), two of which came from adjacent microfractions
that were close to passing the 50% bioassay cutoff (M08andM31with 57% and 65% inhibition of intracellular
bacterial growth, respectively). These two microfractions were considered
due to their low toxicity toward the amoeba (in red,Figure), since it appeared that many
of the active microfractions were also affecting the growth of the
amoeba.

Dereplication based on tandem MS spectra (MS2) recorded
by data-dependent analysis of the 12 bioactive microfractions using
SIRIUS (in both PI and NI modes) was largely inconclusive. The annotations were generally of low confidence
according to their associated quality scores (by CSI/FingerID), and the proposed structures did not correspond
to those expected based on phytochemical reports on the genus (Knema) level. Nevertheless, molecular formulas (MF) could
be established with confidence at the MS1 level based on HRMS data
in both positive- (PI) and negative-ion (NI) mode (seeTable). Three of them could be matched
with NPs reported in the literature of the genusKnema.M25-26corresponded to kneglobularic
acid B, previously isolated fromKnema globularia, along with kneglobularic acid A which corresponded toM30-31. Khookerianic acid
A was matching the molecular formula found inM29-30and was reported in . All of them were derived from a common
salicylic acid scaffold and belong to the family of anacardic acids.

For each microfraction of interest:m/zin positive (PI) and negative ion mode (NI), molecular
formulae, and characteristic fragment found in the MS2spectrum
and the associated compound number corresponding to eventually purified
compound.

Manual inspection of MS2spectra then revealed
some
fragmentation patterns that appeared across the different fractions.
Two fragment ions were found repeatedly and in a mutually exclusive
manner in the different fractions targeted (Table), one with anm/zof 149.0597 (C9H9O+)
and another with anm/zof 107.0491
(C7H7O+). This observation suggested
that the main compounds highlighted as being bioactive exhibited repeated
structural patterns. The C7H7O+fragment
is in fact a plausible fragment of anacardic acids and was found in
all three sets of microfractions (M25-26,M29-30, andM30-31) annotated as anacardic acid derivatives (Table).

Several bioactive HPLC peaks could
not be fully dereplicated at
this level, and several MF were not previously reported in theKnemagenus. To establish biological activity for individual
compounds and unambiguously determine their structure, targeted isolations
were carried out to purify all of the NPs of interest listed inTable.

For complete de
novo structural identification and bioactivity characterization, isolation
of compounds corresponding to MS2spectra highlighted by
HPLC bioactivity profiling was necessary. This was done at a larger
scale using flash-UV chromatography (0.5 g of extract used against
13.05 mg used for the HPLC bioactivity profiling process). First,
the standard conditions were optimized at the analytical scale using
an HPLC before being geometrically transferred to the flash-UV chromatography scale. Using this approach,
12 NPs were isolated in amounts ranging from 2.4 to 38 mg (Figure).

Full de
novo structure identifications of the isolated compounds revealed
that they were acetophenone and anacardic acid derivatives. A total
of five structures among those inFigurewere known (8–12). As expected from previous dereplications, khookerianic
acid A (8,M29-30) and khookerianic
acid C (10,M30-31) were previously
isolated from (Q5457252). Kneglobularic acid B (9,M25-26) and kneglobularic acid A (other name
for10) were previously isolated from (Q5399660). Anagigantic acid (11) was first isolated from the pericarp
ofAnacardium giganteum(Q9673175) and 6-tridecylsalicylic acid (12) was isolated
from the brown algaeCaulocystis cephalornithos(Q29146806).

Additionally, seven new structures were
identified and were named
knemolone A–D (1–2,4–5) and knemolic acid A–C (3,6–7) based on characteristic 2D-NMR correlations
(Figure).

acid scaffolds (3). Blue: HMBC correlations, green: COSY correlations,
and red: ROESY correlations.

Knemolone A–D (1–2,4–5) were isolated as yellow oils with [M-H]−ofm/z327.1237/283.1337/311.1651/277.1808
corresponding to MF of C19H20O5(error
−0.31 ppm)/C18H20O3(error
−1.06 ppm)/C20H24O3(error
−0.64 ppm)/C17H26O3(error
−0.36 ppm), respectively. The1H and13C NMR data (TableandSupporting InformationS1.3./S2.3./S4.3./S5.3.
and S1.4./S2.4./S4.4./S5.4.) displayed evidence of the resacetophenone
moiety in these four compounds being reminiscent of that described
in khookerianone A. Similarly, the alkyl
chain connected to the aromatic ring at C-6 with correlations described
in that report was also observed in the data of all the new knemolones.

Differences appeared in the lengths of the alkyl chains
and its
termination. Knemolone A (1), B (2), and
C (4) all showed evidence of the other end of the alkyl
chain being connected to another aromatic ring at the C-1a position
(δC136.0/142.1/142.7), with HMBC
correlations between H-4′ (δH2.56/2.64) and H-6′ (δH2.60) and C-2″ (δC108.3/128.5/128.4)
and C-6″ (δC121.2/128.5/128.4).
This aromatic ring appeared to be trisubstituted in1as opposed to monosubstituted and terminal in2and4(see δHinTable). Compound1was
substituted at C-3′’ and C-4″ with a dioxolane
cycle, evidenced by the HMBC correlations between the dioxolane OCH2O (C-1‴, δH5.92)
and C-3″ (δC147.7) and C-4″
(δC145.8). Knemolone D (5), on the other hand, had no second aromatic ring, instead having
a terminal methyl group at the end of a longer chain of 9 carbons
at C-9′ (δH0.88) correlating
with C-8′ (δC22.8) and C-7′
(δC32.0).

Knemolic acids
A–C (3,6–7) were isolated
as light green amorphous powders with [M-H]−ofm/z313.1079/341.1391/297.1495
corresponding to MF of C18H18O5(error
−0.64 ppm)/C20H22O5(error
−0.88 ppm)/C19H22O3(error
−0.34 ppm), respectively. The1H and13C NMR data (TableandSupporting InformationS3.2./S6.3./S7.3.
and S3.3./S6.4./S7.4.) for knemolic acid A was in fact similar to
that of knemolone A (1), except for positions 1–7.
Instead of a tetrasubstituted resacetophenone scaffold, compound3showed evidence of a trisubstituted anacardic acid scaffold.
C-7 (δC174.0) has a chemical shift
in line with that of a carboxylic acid, which is much lower than that
of the previously observed ketone. This carboxylic acid group was
positioned on C-1 (δC110.5) as
it was the last available point of substitution of the aromatic ring
not yet assigned. The chemical shift of C-1 was also in agreement
with the presence of an acid group and a neighboring hydroxyl group
on C-2 (δC163.8). Chemical shifts
on that aromatic ring were also in line with those reported for khookerianic
acid C.

In the end, 4 new acetophenone derivatives (1–2,4–5) and 8 salicylic acid
derivatives (3,6–12), of which 3 were newly described NPs (3,6,7), were isolated. Once the structures were elucidated,
it became clear that the C9H9O+fragment
(Table) was characteristic
to all the acetophenone derivatives, while the C7H7O+fragment was characteristic to all salicylic
acid derivatives.

The purity of each identified NP was assessed
using an NMR-based
process (described inSupporting InformationFigure 2), which revealed varying levels of impurities for the 12
isolated NPs (Supporting InformationTable
1). The following part on biological results was refined to focus
on compounds that were considered pure (at least 90% purity according
to the described metric, leaving compounds7and8,Table),
but all 12 samples containing the NPs have been tested, and the full
data with associated purity scores can be found inSupporting InformationTable 2. Additionally, a commercial
standard of similar chemical structure (anacardic acid) was also tested
to confirm that the anti-infective activities observed were indeed
associated with the studied chemical structures. For all compounds,
the level of impurities did not preclude their unambiguous structural
identification (by NMR and HRMS).

Anacardic was added as a standard
of the same chemical class as some isolated NPs, rifabutin as the
positive control for antimycobacterial activity against Mm, and vancomycin
for antibacterial activities against (Sa).

Most of the isolated
compounds followed a similar pattern of activity when it came to their
effects on Mm. They were broadly inactive against the bacterium alone
(“in broth”), while in the infection model, most of
them affected both Mm and the host Dd in a similar manner (Table). This followed the
initial pattern of activity observed at the extract level, with no
separation of the anti-infective effect from the unwanted inhibition
of the amoeba growth. Salicylic acid derivatives were generally more
active than the acetophenones on bacterial growth in infection.

All 12 compounds were also tested against Gram-negative (Pa) and Gram-positive (Sa). While none of them displayed specific
activity against Pa, most of them showed some activity when tested
against Sa with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) reaching
as low as 8 μg.mL–1(Table). Readouts on those two additional bacteria
seemed to suggest that Mm in broth behaved more closely toward Pa
than toward Sa in the case of these isolated NPs.

Anacardic
acid was already reported as active against Sa at a dose of 25 μg mL–1, which
is broadly in line with the experimental MIC value observed
at 16 μg mL–1(Table).

Synthetic derivatization was pursued using the acetophenone scaffold,
which offered a balance between moderate anti-infective properties
and good antibacterial activity against Sa for certain derivatives.
We opted to introduce halogen atoms (chlorine and bromine in particular)
into this scaffold, as such substitutions can boost biological activities.−Halogen bonding is the typical type of interactions halogens can
build with a target, where they behave as Lewis acids (driven by a
positively charged region known as a “σ-hole”
on the halogen) and can interact with Lewis bases. For these derivatizations, cheaply available and abundant
2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (13,Figure) was used as the starting material.

Compounds synthesized
from derivatization of the 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone
scaffold.

The first step of halogenation reaction was chosen to alter the electronegativity of
the 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone
cycle. Both chlorine and bromine could be added in a nonselective
manner through an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) mechanism
on positions 3- and/or 5- of the starting material13. Bioactivity measurements on the halogenated acetophenone derivatives
suggested that chlorination (15–17) increased the potency of compounds on both anti-infective and Dd-inhibition
(Table). Bromination
(18–20) did not seem to affect activity
readouts in a significant manner.

In the second step, an aldolization reaction was carried
out on
the ketone moiety to introduce a phenyl-containing side chain in analogy
to compounds2and4. It seemed at first
that this addition even on nonhalogenated starting material13generated toxicity toward the amoeba, with compound14having a similar effect on both the amoeba and the bacteria.
This was also reflected in all halogenated derivatives that have undergone
aldolization (15–20vs21–27), where the absolute anti-infective activity
had increased but so did the activity on the growth of the amoeba.
Eventually, the 5-chloro-chalcone scaffold (22) was chosen
for further derivatization based mainly on higher yields during the
chlorination reaction (39.3%) compared to the dichlorinated analogue
(23, 3.54%).

Derivatizing the aldehyde moiety used
in the aldolization reaction was another
method used to reduce the toxicity
observed with compounds derived from benzaldehyde. Both naphthaldehyde
and anthracene-carboxaldehyde were chosen as more bulky alternatives
to benzaldehyde that would retain the same types of π–π
stacking interactions. In practice, the naphthalene group did not
reduce the toxicity toward the amoeba for compound26compared to its benzaldehyde-derived analogue22. The
bulkiness of the anthracene-carboxaldehyde moiety, however, appeared
to have a positive effect as it reduced toxicity toward the amoeba
to an IC50of 15.87 μM for compound27(Table). In the
end, compound27was the best candidate with improved
activity compared to its natural analogues, with an IC50of 0.59 μM on intracellular Mm and 15.87 μM against
Dd growth, representing a 25-fold specificity window, making it a
promising strict anti-infective candidate for further investigations.

As all NPs previously introduced were inactive against Pa, synthetic
derivatives were not tested against that strain. However, they were
all tested against Sa and some showed improved activity, with the
overall best candidate also being compound27. Interestingly,
in the case of , there was
a difference in activity between the monochlorinated chalcone derivatives
(21and22with MICs at 32 μg mL–1) and the dichlorinated chalcone (23),
which had significantly lower MICs at 4 μg mL–1. This distinction was not observable with Mm in infection, where
all three patterns of chlorination yielded identical IC50values (1.76 μM).

Additional
experiments to correlate biological readouts between NPs and synthetic
analogues were made through hemisynthesis. The same chlorination reaction
was carried out on an isolated aliquot of compound4,
resulting in both its 3-chloro- (28) and 3,5-dichloro-derivatives
(29) being successfully isolated (Figure,Table). No monochlorinated 5-chloro-derivative was observed
in sufficient quantity to be isolated, which can be explained by strong
para-directing effects in the EAS mechanism exerted by the hydroxyl
groups present in the molecule. In that
respect, the hydroxyl group at position 6 had the most notable effect
in directing the chlorination at position 3 as it was unsubstituted.
The formation of the dichlorinated analogue (29) was
likely due to some excess chlorinating reagent being involved in the
second EAS step on position 5 of monochlorinated product28.

Hemisynthetic chlorinated derivatives of compound4.

Chlorination of4resulted in an increase
of potency
for both anti-infective activity and Dd inhibition, while the activity
on Sa remained largely unchanged. This difference in bioactivity between
both experiments (anti-infective on Mm vs antibacterial on Sa) suggested
that the compounds may be acting through different mechanisms of action.

This bioguided study eventually led to the
identification of 12
NPs as a first phytochemical report on the species , among which 7 structures were newly
described. The two prominent structural backbones found in the plant
(2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone and salicylic acid) were associated with
growth inhibition of both Mm and Dd, but limited to the infection
model, with no activity observed on the naked mycobacteria. Both scaffolds
were also active on Gram-positive Sa, which is in line with extensive
reports of such antibacterial activities especially for anacardic
acid derivatives.,In terms of anti-infective activities,
however, the unmodified NPs presented limited selectivity toward Mm
as they were equally active to reduce the growth of Dd.

Subsequent
synthetic derivatization of the 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone
scaffold resulted in a series of derivatives with improved inhibitory
activity on both Mm in infection and. The chlorination of the acetophenone had a beneficial effect on
the anti-infective activity, as did the reduction of size of the aliphatic
chain compared to natural analogues and the increase in size of the
aromatic unsubstituted parts of the NPs. Compound27was
the best candidate for both models, having an IC50of 0.59
μM on Mm (with an improvement in its selectivity against Mm
as the IC50on the amoeba stood at 15.87 μM) as well
as an MIC of 2 μg mL–1on Sa. Such activities
recorded on a low MW molecule (374 g·mol–1)
held promise in terms of room for further functional improvements
in structure–activity relationship investigations. This compound
is also a promising candidate for the relatively simple chemistry
and a cheap two-step synthetic route it relies on.

Chlorination
on the NP4also showed a beneficial
effect in improving both its absolute value of IC50against
Mm and its therapeutic window compared to the host growth inhibition
(dichlorination mostly). It seemed though that fully synthetic analogues
inspired from the isolated NPs showed more potential in terms of anti-infective
activities.

NMR data were collected
on a Bruker Avance III HD 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a
QCI 5 mm cryoprobe and a SampleJet automated sample changer (Bruker
BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Chemical shifts are presented in
parts per million (δ), referencing the residual CDCl3(for NPs, δH 7.26; δC 77.0) or DMSO-d6(for synthetic molecules, δH 2.50; δC 39.5)
signals as internal standards for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively, with
coupling constants (J) reported in Hz. Full assignments were determined
through 2D NMR experiments (COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC). HRMS data
were acquired using an Orbitrap Exploris 120 mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific, Germany) with a heated electrospray (H-ESI) source. Fraction
contents were monitored using a multidetection UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS platform
(Waters) equipped with a single quadrupole detector and heated electrospray
ionization. Analytical HPLC utilized an Agilent Model 1260 system
with a photodiode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Semipreparative HPLC was conducted on a modular system (puriFlash-MS
4250, INTERCHIM, Montluçon, France) equipped with a quaternary
pump, a UV detector module, and a fraction collector.

The plant containing the compounds of
interest was (King)
Warb. This plant belongs to the Pierre Fabre Laboratories (PFL) collection
with over 17,000 unique samples collected worldwide. The PFL collection
was registered with the European Commission under accession number
03-FR-2020. This registration certifies that the collection meets
the criteria set out in the EU ABS Regulation, which implements at
the EU level the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol regarding access
to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
arising from their utilization (Sharing nature, 2022). PFL supplied
all of the vegetal material (ground dry material). The plant material
was dried for 3 days at 55 °C in an oven; then the material was
ground and stored in plastic pots at controlled temperature and humidity
in PFL facilities. The leaves were the chosen plant part used for
the plant studied, with their following unique IDs within the PFL
collection: V113295 ( leaves).

The plant material was extracted in
a Thermo Scientific Dionex ASE 350 Accelerated Solvent Extractor.
The roots of (35.78
g) were extracted in a 100 mL pressure-resistant stainless steel extraction
cell using the ASE system. At the bottom and top of the cell, a cellulose
filter (Dionex) was added to prevent solid particles from reaching
the system. The cell was loaded in the tray then pressurized and extracted
with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol, respectively. The rinse
volume was set at 60% and the temperature at 40 °C, with 3 cycles
for each solvent (6 cycles for the ethyl acetate extracts) and a static
time set at 5 min. The resulting extracts were collected in round-bottom
flasks, combined and evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator
(Büchi Rotavapor R114 Labortechnik AG, Switzerland) for each
solvent to constitute the final extracts. The following extraction
yields were obtained: hexane 659.4 mg (1.84%), ethyl acetate 628.1 mg (1.76%), and methanol
1.1617 g (3.25%).

Aliquots (50
μL) of fractions were analyzed by UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS. The conditions
for the ESI (Waters Acquity QDA Detector) were set as follows: capillary
voltage 0.8 kV (negative ion mode) or 1.2 kV (positive ion mode),
cone voltage 15 V, probe temperature 600 °C, source temperature
120 °C. Detection was performed in negative (NI) then positive
ion mode (PI) with anm/zrange
of 150–1250 Da. The separation was done on an Acquity UPLC
BEH C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm inner diameter, 1.7 μm; Waters)
at 0.6 mL/min, 40 °C with H2O (A) and MeCN (B) both
containing 0.1% formic acid. The following gradient was applied for
the separation: from 5 to 100% of B from 0 to 7 min, 1 min at 100%
B, and a re-equilibration step of 2 min. The ELSD was set at 45 °C,
with a gain of 3. The PDA detector (Waters Acquity) was set in the
range from 190 to 500 nm, with a resolution of 1.2 nm. Sampling rate
was set at 20 points/s.

Analyses were performed with a Waters Acquity UHPLC system coupled
to a Corona Veo RS Charged Aerosol Detector (CAD, Thermo Scientific,
Germany) and an Orbitrap Exploris 120 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
Germany). The Orbitrap employed a heated electrospray ionization source
(H-ESI) with the following parameters: spray voltage: +3.5 kV; ion
transfer tube temperature: 320.00 °C; vaporizer temperature:
320.00 °C; S-lens RF: 45 (arb units); sheath gas flow rate: 35.00
(arb units); sweep gas (arb): 1; and auxiliary gas flow rate: 10.00
(arb. units). Control of the instruments was done using Thermo Scientific
Xcalibur software v. 4.6.67.17. Full scans were acquired at a resolution
of 30,000 fwhm (atm/z200) and
MS2 scans at 15,000 fwhm in the range of 100–1000m/z, with 1 microscan, time (ms): 200, an RF lens
(%): 70; AGC target custom (Normalized AGC target (%): 300); maximum
injection time (ms): 130; microscans: 1; data type: profile; Use EASY-IC­(TM):
ON. The settings for dynamic exclusion mode were customized; exclude
after n times: 1; exclusion duration (s): 5; mass tolerance: ppm;
low: 10, high: 10, exclude isotopes: true. Apex detention: Desired
Apex Window (%): 50. Isotope exclusion: assigned and unassigned with
an exclusion window (m/z) for unassigned
isotopes: 8. The intensity threshold was set to 2.5 × 105, and a targeted mass exclusion list was used.

The centroid
data-dependent MS2 scan acquisition events were performed in discovery
mode, triggered by Apex detection with a trigger detection (%) of
300 with a maximum injection time of 120 ms, performing 1 microscan.
The top 3 abundant precursors (charge states 1 and 2) within an isolation
window of 1.2m/zwere considered
for MS/MS analysis. For precursor fragmentation in the HCD mode, a
normalized collision energy of 15, 30, and 45% was used. Data was
recorded in profile mode (Use EASY-IC­(TM): ON).

The chromatographic
separation was done on a Waters BEH C18 column
(50 × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm, Waters, Milford, MA) using the
following gradient (time (min), %B): 5%B from 0 to 0.5 min; from 5%B
to 100%B between 0.5 and 7 min; 100%B from 7 to 8 min, from 100%B
to 5%B from 8 to 8.10 min; and 5%B from 8.10 to 10 min. The mobile
phases were (A) H2O and (B) acetonitrile, both containing
0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was set to 600 μL/min, the injection
volume was 2 μL, and the column was kept at 40 °C. The
PDA detector was used from 210 to 400 nm with a resolution of 1.2
nm. The CAD detector was kept at 40 °C, with 5 bar of N2and power function 1 for a data collection rate of 20 Hz.

The analysis was carried out using an HP 1260 system equipped with
a diode-array detection unit from Agilent Technologies in Santa Clara,
CA, United States. An INTERCHIM puriFlash HQ C18 column (250 ×
4.6 mm inner diameter, 15 μm, Montluçon, France) was
employed. Detection was performed using a PDA, with UV wavelengths
set at 220, 254, 280, and 329 nm. UV spectra between 190 and 500 nm
were recorded with a threshold of 10 mAU and setting increments of
2 nm. HPLC conditions involved a mobile phase of H2O (A)
and MeOH (B), both containing 0.1% FA. The flow rate was set at 1
mL/min, with an injection volume of 10 μL. The separation temperature
was maintained at 25 °C, and the sample concentration was 10
mg/mL dissolved in MeOH. The gradient of the mobile phases was programmed
as follows: an initial hold of 3 min at 70% B, followed by a gradient
flow of 70%–87.5% of B over 39 min, followed by 3 min during
which the gradient was kept at 87.5%, then another gradient flow of
87.5%–100% of B over 19 min, ending with a 6 min washing step
with 100% B. These optimized HPLC analytical conditions were geometrically
transferred by gradient transfer to the flash-LC scale.

The ethyl
acetate extract of (leaves)
was purified with a Büchi Flash chromatography system (Büchi
Pump Module C-605, UV Photometer C-640, Control Unit C-620, Fraction
Collector C-660), using an INTERCHIM puriFlash HQ C18 column (120
g, 210 × 30 mm i.d., 15 μm, Moluçon, France). 0.5
g of extract was mixed in the stationary phase (C18 Zeoprep 40–63
μm) and sand (50–70 mesh particle size) in a proportion
of 1:1:1 and then introduced in a dry load cell. The detection was
performed by a UV Photometer with the parameters set as follows: UV
wavelengths were 220, 254, 280, and 329 nm. The mobile phase was composed
of H2O (A) and technical grade methanol (B), both containing
0.1% F.A (flow rate of 30 mL/min). The gradient slope was set as follows:
an initial hold of 4 min at 70% B, a gradient flow of 70%–87.5%
of B in 56 min, followed by a hold of 4 min at 87.5%, then another
gradient flow of 87.5%–100% in 27 min, followed by 9 min of
washing at 100% B. The separation yielded 70 fractions of 50 mL each
(F01–F70) that were dried using a multiunit evaporator (Multivapor,
Büchi Labortechnik AG, Switzerland). The following compounds
were identified after HRMS and NMR analyses for confirmations:1(F08, 2.9 mg, RT 12 min),2(F09, 2.8 mg, RT

This
procedure was inspired by that described in Wu et al. (2020). To a solution of 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (5
g, 1 equiv) in EtOH (50 mL) was added con. H2SO4(1 equiv) at room temperature; the mixture was stirred for 5 min.
Then, N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (1 equiv)
was added to the mixture. The reaction was monitored by using an UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS
instrument. With NBS, the reaction was generally instantaneous, while
with NCS, the reaction was left to stir for 24 h. The mixture was
evaporated to dryness and redissolved in EtOAc (500 mL). The organic
layer was washed with H2O (2 × 500 mL) and then brine
(500 mL), before being dried with MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness
to obtain 6.3314 g (with NCS) and 4.8777 g (with NBS) of the product
as a white solid (NCS)/yellow solid (NBS) mixture of 3 compounds (2
monohalogenated isomers +1 dihalogenated compound).

For the
chlorination reaction, a mass of 2.92 g of the mixture was then subjected
to flash chromatography using a BGB Scorpius C18e-HP column (155 g,
220 × 48 mm i.d., 30 μm, Bockten, Switzerland). The mobile
phases were (A) H2O and (B) technical grade methanol, both
containing 0.1% F.A (flow rate of 50 mL/min). The gradient slope was
set as follows: an initial hold of 2 min at 20% B, a gradient flow
of 20%–40% of B in 59 min, followed by a gradient flow of 47
min from 40%–65%, then another gradient flow of 65%–100%
in 16 min. The separation yielded 112 fractions of 50 mL each (F01–F112)
that were combined according to their respective peaks and evaporated
to dryness. The following compounds were identified after HRMS and
NMR analyses for confirmations:15(F46–59, 990.2
mg, 35.0%, RT 43–57 min),16(F61–78, 1.1116
g, 39.3%, RT 57–73 min), and17(F81–87,
100 mg, 3.54%, RT 75–81 min).

For the bromination reaction,
a mass of 4.6 g of the mixture was
then subjected to flash chromatography using a BGB Scorpius C18e-HP
column (155 g, 220 × 48 mm i.d., 30 μm, Bockten, Switzerland).
The mobile phases were (A) H2O and (B) technical grade
methanol, both containing 0.1% F.A (flow rate of 50 mL/min). The gradient
slope was set as follows: an isocratic gradient of 65% B during 74
min, followed by a gradient flow of 12 min from 65%–100% followed
by an isocratic washing step at 100% B for 17 min. The separation
yielded 103 fractions of 50 mL each (F01–F103) that were combined
according to their respective peaks and evaporated to dryness. The
following compounds were identified after HRMS and NMR analyses for
confirmations:18(F28–47, 1.7603 g, 24.7%, RT
30–49 min),19(F49–88, 1.2801 g, 18.0%,
RT 50–89 min), and17(F90–92, 622.4 mg,
6.52%, RT 90–92 min).

This procedure was inspired by that described in Devakaram et al.
(2011). To a solution of ketone (200
mg, 1 equiv) in MeOH (10 mL), an aldehyde (1 equiv) was added, then
10 mL of a solution of 60% KOH in water was added, and the reaction
was left to stir for 24 h. The reaction was monitored using an UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS
instrument. Once over, the reaction was quenched with a cold 1 M HCl
solution (100 mL), and the mixture was extracted with DCM (2 ×
20 mL). The organic layer was dried with MgSO4before being
evaporated under reduced pressure to result in 248.9 mg of the aldolized
product as a yellow powder (93%).

This procedure was inspired by that described
in Wu et al. (2020). To a solution of
Knemolone C (4, 3.05 mg 1 equiv) in EtOH (0.5 mL) was
added con. H2SO4(0.549 μL, 1.05 equiv)
at room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. Then,
N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) (1.304 mg, 1 equiv) was added to the mixture.
The reaction was monitored using an UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS instrument (reaction
was left to stir for 24 h). The mixture was evaporated to dryness
and redissolved in EtOAc (10 mL). The organic layer was washed with
H2O (2 × 10 mL) and then brine (10 mL), before being
dried with MgSO4and evaporated to dryness to obtain 2.07
mg of the product as a white solid mixture, which was then dissolved
in 200 μL of EtOAc and subjected to HPLC microfractionation
using a XBridge BEH C18 OBD Prep column (130 Å, 250 × 10
mm, 5 μm, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The mobile phases
were (A) H2O and (B) HPLC grade acetonitrile, both containing
0.1% F.A (flow rate of 4.7 mL/min). The gradient slope was set as
follows: an initial hold at 50% of B during 1 min, followed by a gradient
flow of 19 min from 50%–80% followed by a gradient flow from
80%–100% of B for 5 min, and finally a washing step of 5 min
at 100% B. The separation yielded 96 fractions (A01–H12) that
were combined according to their respective peaks and evaporated to
dryness. The following compounds were identified after HRMS and NMR
analyses for confirmations:28(E3–E4, 0.81 mg,
23.9%, RT 16 min) and29(E11–E12, 0.25 mg, 6.74%,
RT 19 min).

Plant extracts, fractions,
or isolated compounds were stored at −20 °C and wrapped
in aluminum foil if necessary. All manipulations with extracts, fractions,
or compounds were performed under a sterile hood. Extracts, fractions,
and compounds were resuspended throughout in DMSO to best solubilize
extracts with diverse constituents. Extracts, fractions, or compounds
were added to the assay plate in a 1:100 dilution. Assay solutions
of extracts, fractions, and compounds were prepared in 96-well plates,
stored at −20 °C, and thawed before the experiment at
room temperature or warmer with or without shaking/vortexing to obtain
a clear assay solution. Extracts were tested at 25 μg/mL and
purified compounds in a dose–response curve of 6 concentrations
with 100 μM being the top concentration and a 1:3 dilution step
between each testing concentration. Since fractions were not weighed
individually, the injection mass was used to calculate an average
mass per fraction and thus a nominal mass concentration. Fractions
were tested at a nominal concentration of 10 μg/mL.

As
described in Nitschke et al. and Mottet
et al., Dd Ax2­(ka) expressing mCherry
from the act5 chromosomal locus was infected
with Mm M strain expressing the lux operon (luxCDABE),by spinoculation.

Briefly, the day before the experiment,
Mm was cultivated in 7H9
broth (Becton Dickinson, Difco Middlebrook 7H9) supplemented with
10% OADC (Becton Dickinson) and 0.05% tyloxapol (Sigma-Aldrich) and
50 μg/mL kanamycin at 32 °C overnight with continuous shaking.
Additionally, the day before the experiment, 107amoebae
were plated in HL5-C in a 10 cm Petri dish (Falcon). On the day of
the experiment, a volume of the Mm culture corresponding to a multiplicity
of infection of 25 with respect to the number of amoebae in the Petri
dish was added to the semiconfluent amoebae monolayer. Subsequently,
the Petri dishes were centrifuged twice at 500g,
as described in Mottet et al. To remove
extracellular bacteria, dishes were rinsed with fresh HL5-C, and the
infected cell population was resuspended in HL5-C with 5 U/mL penicillin
and 5 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) to inhibit the extracellular
growth of bacteria during the course of the experiment.

For
testing fractions and purified compounds, 20 μL of infected
cell suspension was plated into each well of a 384-well plate (Interchim
FP-BA8240) to an effective cell number of 1 × 104cells
per well. Fractions or compounds including a vehicle control (0.3%
DMSO final concentration) and a positive control (rifabutin, 10 μM
final concentration) were added using an electronic multipipette (Sartorius).
Subsequently, the well plates were sealed with a gas impermeable membrane
(H769.1, Carl Roth), briefly centrifuged, and intracellular bacterial
growth was monitored using an Agilent BioTek H1 plate reader and an
Agilent BioTek BioStack plate stacker by recording luminescence over
72 h at 25 °C with readings taken every hour. Fluorescence was
also recorded to monitor amoeba growth.

For testing bacteria
in broth, the preculture was diluted to a
bacterial density of 3.75 × 105bacteria per mL in
7H9 medium. Plating bacteria and compounds or fractions was performed
analogously to the infection assay described above. Bacteria growth
was monitored with the Agilent BioTek H1 plate reader by recording
luminescence at 32 °C.

For both assays, growth curves were
obtained by measuring the luminescence
and fluorescence as a proxy for bacterial growth and host growth,
respectively, for 72 h with time-points taken every hour. The “normalized
residual growth” was computed by calculating the area under
the curve (AUC, trapezoid method) and normalizing it to the vehicle
control (0.3% DMSO, set at 1) and a baseline curve (set at 0). The
baseline curve was calculated by taking the median of the first measurement
of all wells in a plate and extrapolating it over the complete time
course. The threshold for hit detection was arbitrarily fixed at a
cutoff of normalized residual growth ≤0.5. Normalized values
were averaged over technical and biological replicates (all experiments
on isolated compounds have at leastn= 3 andN= 3, whereas the primary extract screening and microfractions
testing had values ofn= 1 andN= 3).

This procedure was also applied to screening extracts
with slight
modifications. The day before the experiment we preplated 10 μL
of HL5-C using a dispenser (Thermo Multidrop), subsequently we preplated
2.2 μL of dissolved extracts from 96-well plates into quadrants
1, 2, and 3 of 384-well plates, whereas quadrant 4 was used for positive
and vehicle controls. Preplating of extracts was performed using a
liquid handler (Agilent Bravo). In total, 24 extract plates were distributed
in triplicate into eight 384-well plates, amounting to 24 assay plates.
The prepared plates were sealed and stored at 4 °C overnight.
On the day of the experiment, nine 10 cm Petri dishes were infected
(as described before) and grouped into three pools. The cell suspension
was adjusted to 106cells/mL, and 10 μL was plated
into the 24 assay plates, resulting in 104cells per well,
as used for conventional infection experiments. Plates were sealed
and placed in the plate stacker that supplied the plate reader. The
same procedure was used to screen the same extracts on Mm in a broth.
For both assays, the first time points and a time point after 72 h
were recorded. Subsequently, we normalized the end point, first with
the median of the full assay plate at the first time point and second
with the end point of the vehicle controls in the respective assay
plate.

For IC50estimation, we used a rudimentary
approach
of interpolating the sample concentration between the two normalized
residual growth values, which were closest to a value of 0.5.

MICs were determined
in Mueller–Hinton (MH) broth according to CLSI guidelines and were repeated at least on three different
occasions.

The Newman strain of and the UCBPP-PA14 strain of were used
in this study.
