Variations in host species significantly impact bacterial growth traits and antibiotic resistance, making it essential to consider host origin when evaluating the zoonotic potential of pathogens. This study focuses on multipleBrucellaspecies, which share highly similar genetic material, to explore the relationship between host origin and zoonotic potential by integrating pan-genome-wide association studies (pan-GWAS) with machine learning (ML). Our results present an open pangenome ofBrucellaspp. derived from the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 991 strains and identify 268 genes potentially associated with the zoonotic potential ofBrucella. Integrating these genes into an ML model based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm allows us to predict the zoonotic potential of variousBrucellastrains with high accuracy. Our findings reveal that zoonotic potential varies by host origin:Brucella melitensisstrains isolated from humans exhibit higher zoonotic potential than those isolated from cattle, goats, and sheep, whileBrucella suisbiovar 2 strains isolated from domestic pigs display higher zoonotic potential than those isolated from wild boars. Our study proposes a method for predicting and quantifying the zoonotic potential of closely related bacterial pathogens from different host origins, providing valuable insights for risk assessment and public health strategy.

This study proposed a method for identifying the host origins for zoonotic pathogens by integrating pan-genome-wide association studies with machine learning algorithms. The application of the proposed method on theBrucellaspecies revealed diverse zoonotic host origins and potentials.

Bacteria exhibit an exceptionally broad distribution across natural environments, occupying nearly all ecosystems, including soil, aquatic systems, and the internal environments of plants and animals1. This extensive distribution underscores the diverse survival strategies of bacteria, enabling them to persist within a variety of hosts and to form intricate interactions with hosts2–4. Numerous pathogenic bacteria display distinct host specificity, thriving and reproducing solely within defined specific hosts, while some bacteria demonstrate the ability to infect a wide range of host species5,6. Furthermore, the phenomenon of host jump among bacteria has drawn increasing attention, as it enables bacteria to cross species boundaries, potentially leading to the emergence of novel infectious diseases7. The transition of pathogenic bacteria from one host to another, particularly when shifting from animal hosts to humans, poses a substantial threat to public health. Consequently, the surveillance and investigation of bacterial host adaptability and their potential for interspecies transmission are critical for the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks in future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the significant challenges that novel pathogens pose to global public health, highlighting that zoonotic pathogen spillovers into human populations can act as precursors to new pandemics. In this context, accurately predicting the zoonotic potential of pathogens has become critically important. The current approach to predicting the zoonotic potential of closely related bacterial pathogens primarily relies on phylogenetic analysis8. However, the phylogenetic analysis often lacks the resolution required for high-precision zoonotic risk assessments9. This limitation restricts our ability to reliably forecast the zoonotic potential of closely related bacterial pathogens, consequently hampering the design of effective intervention strategies. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more refined and accurate assessment tools capable of rapidly identifying and mitigating the threats posed by closely related bacterial pathogens to human health.

Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by members of the genusBrucellathat can be transmitted from livestock and wildlife to humans. The genusBrucellaconsists of highly homogenous species of bacteria with minimal genetic variation, which comprises six classicalBrucellaspecies and six atypicalBrucellaspecies10,11. For a considerable period of time, only six classical species were recognized within the genusBrucella, including the main causative pathogens for human brucellosis:Brucella melitensis,B. abortus, andB. suis12,13. Except for the threeBrucellaspecies as above that are highly harmful to both humans and their natural hosts,B. canisandB. neotomaehave been reported to cause human brucellosis, which are also members of the classicalBrucellaspecies14,15. It is noteworthy thatB. neotomaewas previously classified as a non-zoonotic species among classicalBrucellaspecies, but recent evidence suggests thatB. neotomaemay have zoonotic potential12,16. In recent years, several new atypical species ofBrucellahave been described, includingB. ceti,B. pinnipedialis,B. microti,B. inopinata,B. vulpis, andB. papionis. Nevertheless, the zoonotic potential of these atypicalBrucellaspecies remains largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the zoonotic potential of variousBrucellaspecies within the genusBrucellato provide valuable data for the control and prevention of brucellosis.

The number of publicly available whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for the genusBrucellais continually increasing due to advancements in next-generation sequencing technology17, providing a prerequisite for assessing the zoonotic potential ofBrucellabased on WGS data. However, it is challenging to extract meaningful information from the large complex WGS data ofBrucellausing conventional statistical methods18. Machine learning (ML) has the ability to classify, cluster, and recognize patterns for large amounts of data19. It can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning depending on the need for human intervention during the training process20. Supervised ML uses labeled datasets to train algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DTC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict output based on labeled input data21–23. There have been numerous studies using ML as a tool to investigate the correlation between pathogenic genetic information and virulence or host preference24–27. This showcases the immense application potential of ML.

In this study, we performed pangenome-wide association studies (pan-GWAS) on 991Brucellagenomes to identify specific genes associated with zoonotic phenotypes. These genes were then employed as features in ML models. Subsequently, we conducted various ML models using different algorithms, and compared their performances in evaluating the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains in the test dataset. The SVM algorithm was selected for developing the prediction model due to its optimal performance among these ML algorithms. The strong generalization ability of the SVM prediction models facilitated its broad applicability across various strains within the genusBrucella. Furthermore, the SVM models provided a more refined evaluation of the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains from diverse host origins. This capability enables high-resolution predictions of zoonotic potential for strains within the sameBrucellaspecies. Model explanations have identified important genes for the evaluation of the SVM prediction models, and these genes may contribute to the zoonotic potential of strains fromBrucellaspecies.

To examine the genomic features ofBrucella, we used 11 differentBrucellaspecies of publicly available genomes to characterize and define its pangenome. Core genes were defined as a set of genes shared with all 991 strains, accessory genes presented in at least two strain genomes or up to n-1 strain genomes (n: 991, total number of genomes), and the genes presenting only in one strain genome were defined as unique genes. The pangenome was constructed with the dataset consisting of 582 core genes, 4,121 accessory genes, and 2,462 unique genes from 991Brucellaspp. strains. Functional annotation of genes in the pangenome was conducted utilizing the Clusters of Orthologous Genes database (COGs), with the results revealing a distinctive distribution of functional categories across the three different pangenome subsets (Fig.1A). Unique genes in the pangenome exhibited a higher ratio of genes annotated to the L category (Replication, recombination, and repair) than core and accessory genes (13.3% vs. 2.3% and 5.6%), with the majority of unique genes that belonged to the L category originating fromB. inopinata(73.6%) (Supplementary Fig.1). Furthermore, we found that the partial L category genes ofB. inopinatawere related to DNA modification, such as DNA adenine methylation, ISP type restriction/modification enzyme and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase, indicating thatB. inopinatamay possess substantial epigenetic plasticity to aid in niche shift.

ATheBrucellaspp. pangenome can be divided into three gene subsets: (i) core gene (the gene is present in n genomes, where n represents the total number of genomes), (ii) accessory gene (the gene is present in a number of genomes ranging between 2 and n-1), and (iii) unique gene (the gene is exclusively present in a single genome). The annotation and categorization of genes were performed by the COGs. COG categories encompass the following: Information storage and processing, which encompasses J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis), A (RNA processing and modification), K (Transcription), L (Replication, recombination and repair), and B (Chromatin structure and dynamics); Cellular processes and signaling, including D (Cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning), V (Defense mechanisms), T (Signal transduction mechanisms), M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis), N (Cell motility), Z (Cytoskeleton), W (Extracellular structures), U (Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport), and O (Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones); Metabolism, including C (Energy production and conversion), G (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism), E (Amino acid transport and metabolism), F (Nucleotide transport and metabolism), H (Coenzyme transport and metabolism), I (Lipid transport and metabolism), P (Inorganic ion transport and metabolism), and Q (Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism); Poorly characterized, including S (Function unknown).BThe pangenome accumulation plot showed the change in pan genes (purple) and core genes (cyan) with the increasing size of the number of genomes.CThe scatter plot displayed the number of accessory genes (X-axis) and unique genes (Y-axis) possessed by 991Brucellastrains, with the color of the points representing the species of each strain.

Pangenome can be classified into two different types based on openness: open pangenome and closed pangenome. A highly open pangenome indicates that species inhabiting diverse environments possess the ability to exchange genetic material through various mechanisms, while species occupying the strained ecological niches find it challenging to acquire exogenous genes, resulting in a closed pangenome28,29. Heap’s law was used to characterize the pangenome openness ofBrucella, and γ > 0 indicated an open pangenome forBrucella. ForBrucella, we calculated that the relationship between pangenome size (P) and the number of genomes (N) was P = 1260.58*991^0.25, γ equals 0.25, and the pangenome size increased with the addition of new genomes (Fig.1B), indicating thatBrucellahad an open pangenome and the pangenome repertoire of these 11Brucellaspecies was unable to be completely characterized using only the 991 genomes. Subsequently, we counted the number of accessory and unique genes within each strain ofBrucella, and the result revealed that the majority ofBrucellastrains had a low number of unique genes, ranging from 0 to 100. Only five strains, including both twoB. inopinatastrains, had more than 100 unique genes. The number of accessory genes in mostBrucellastrains was around 2300. It is worth noting that bothB. neotomaestrains possessed a relatively low number of accessory genes, and theB. neotomaeNCTC10070 strain had 1891 accessory genes, which is significantly lower than in otherBrucellastrains (Fig.1C). This lower count is probably ascribed to the comparatively small size of the genome of this particular strain, which has a size of 2.9 Mbp.

This was a phylogenetic tree of 991Brucellastrains, reconstructed using a maximum-likelihood algorithm (raxml-ng) based on core gene alignment. Different species strains were labeled according to different colored dots. The red (zoonotic) and blue (non-zoonotic) background colors designated the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains.

To acquire suitable input data for ML, we classifiedB. ovis,B. suisbiovar 5,B. abortus104 M strain, andB. suisS2 strains as non-zoonoticBrucellastrains. Conversely, the zoonoticBrucelladataset encompassed all strains ofB. melitensis,B. abortus, and part of theB. suisstrains (B. suisbiovar 1 andB. suisbiovar 3), while excluding the aforementioned non-zoonotic strains. In total, 883Brucellastrains were manually annotated with zoonotic labels, among which 861 were classified as zoonotic pathogens and 22 as non-zoonotic pathogens. 268 genes with statistically significant associations to zoonotic or non-zoonotic phenotypes (P.adjust<0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg method) were identified as features through pan-GWAS analysis (Supplementary Data1).

We initially employed the PCA algorithm to analyze data from all 991 strains, and PCA plots revealed the presence of non-zoonotic strains that were intermingled with zoonotic strains (Fig.3A). To ascertain the optimal parameter for the K-Means model, the Elbow method and silhouette coefficient were performed to determine the optimal value for the number of clusters in the unsupervised ML algorithm K-Means, and the results revealed that the optimal number of clusters was three (Supplementary Fig.2). The K-Means algorithm classified all strains into three clusters, although most non-zoonotic strains were split into cluster 3, while clusters 1 and 2 contained a mixture of both zoonotic and non-zoonotic strains (Fig.3B). The performance of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm was inadequate in distinguishing between zoonotic strains and non-zoonotic strains (Supplementary Fig.3). These findings implied that unsupervised ML algorithms encountered challenges in discerning the distinction between zoonotic and non-zoonotic strains with precision.

The green dashed line signified the admixture of zoonoticBrucellastrains with non-zoonoticBrucellastrains.BThe K-Means plot of theBrucellastrains. The border lines display the ranges of the three clusters.

Due to the limited performance of unsupervised ML algorithms in distinguishing between zoonotic and non-zoonotic strains, five different supervised ML algorithms (RF, DTC, SVM, KNN, and MLP) were used to develop models for predicting the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains. Briefly, we divided 883Brucellastrains manually annotated with zoonotic labels into training and test datasets using random stratified sampling to ensure that both datasets maintained a proportional representation of zoonotic and non-zoonotic strains. The training dataset was then utilized to train each ML model and assessed the effectiveness of the models by stratified 3-fold cross validation. This entire process was repeated 100 times, and the results were averaged to obtain a more factual quality score for the models. The results showed that the models constructed with supervised ML algorithms achieved exceptional performance, with accuracy, recall, F1, and AUPRC mean scores all over 0.90, indicating that the supervised ML models were able to distinguish between zoonotic strains and non-zoonotic strains. Further analysis showed that the SVM ML model obtained the highest mean scores for all metrics except for the AUC and AUPRC score. Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score is a reliable metric for evaluating the quality of ML model in an imbalanced dataset. Among the five different ML models, the SVM model obtained the highest mean MCC score (0.78), and its MCC score distribution was more concentrated than that of the other ML models. These results suggested that SVM was the most appropriate algorithm for supervised ML model construction forBrucellazoonotic and non-zoonotic strain classification (Fig.4A-F).

The performance of five algorithms was demonstrated by accuracy score (A), recall score (B), F1 score (C), AUC score (D), AUPRC score (E), and MCC score (F). The box plots marked the median, upper and lower quartiles, and 1.5× inter-quartile range (whiskers); outliers were shown as points (n = 100 for each violin plot).

As the most suitable ML algorithm, we retrained the models using the hyperparameters of SVM models with the top 10% MCC score previously. To predict the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrain, the output results of these retrained SVM models were averaged to obtain decision value for quantifying the zoonotic potential of the strain.

The SVM prediction models were designed to generate decision values representing the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains on a continuous scale, with zero established as the threshold. This predictive framework allowed for the classification of zoonotic potential, where positive values indicated zoonotic potential and negative values denoted non-zoonotic potential. Moreover, the magnitude of the decision value reflected the strength of the corresponding classification, providing a quantitative measure of zoonotic potential. As shown in Fig.5A, most of theBrucellastrains from the zoonotic subset of the test dataset obtained decision values above +0.3, while certainB. suisstrains demonstrated substantially lower decision values than others within the zoonotic subset. One strain ofB. suisbv. 1 from the zoonotic test subset was erroneously assigned a decision value of -0.37 (below the threshold of zero), resulting in its misclassification as a non-zoonotic pathogen. (Fig.5A).

The red and blue points represented zoonoticBrucellastrains (A) and non-zoonoticBrucellastrains (B), respectively. The position of the point on the X-axis represented the zoonotic potential of the strain, and the points to the right of zero were predicted to be zoonoticBrucellastrains, while those positioned to the left were predicted to be non-zoonoticBrucellastrains. The red and blue background colors indicated the zoonotic probability density and the non-zoonotic probability density, respectively. The intensity of the background color correlated with the magnitude of zoonotic potential.

In addition, the SVM prediction models accurately predicted the zoonotic potential of the non-zoonotic subset in the test dataset. The decision values for all non-zoonoticBrucellastrains were below the threshold of zero. Notably, the SVM predictive models accurately predicted that theB. ovishad minimal zoonotic potential.B. ovisare generally recognized as non-zoonotic bacteria, exhibited decision values lower than -0.70, which further supported their classification as non-zoonotic bacteria. Two strains ofB. suisbv. 5 were assigned decision values of -0.26 and -0.25, respectively, which were higher than those ofB. ovisstrains, indicating that their non-zoonotic potential was comparatively weaker than that ofB. ovisstrains (Fig.5B).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serves as a crucial virulence factor inBrucella, playing a pivotal role in the intracellular survival ofBrucellawithin host cells.Brucellaspp. are classified into smooth or rough phenotypes depending on whether O-polysaccharide (O-PS) is present on the LPS, and the rough phenotypeBrucellastrains frequently exhibit significantly attenuated virulence compared to the smooth phenotypeBrucellastrains, such asB. melitensisandB. abortus36. The natural rough phenotype ofBrucellaincludesB. ovisandB. canis37. AlthoughB. canisis currently the only species withinBrucellaspp. sharing the same LPS asB. ovis, there have been several reports of human infected byB. canisin recent years, indicating its zoonotic potential15,38,39.

While the SVM prediction models demonstrated excellent predictive performance in the test dataset, it is essential to further evaluate their generalization ability.B. canis, which is the only zoonotic species sharing the absence of O-PS with the non-zoonoticB. ovisspecies inBrucellaspp., provided appropriate data for assessing the generalization ability of SVM prediction models. Therefore, we utilized the SVM prediction models to predict the zoonotic potential of 26 strains ofB. canis. The mean decision value forB. caniswas +0.49. Among the strains ofB. canis, the highest positive decision value was +0.70. Notably,B. caniswas not included in the training dataset of the SVM prediction models. The prediction results suggest thatB. canisexhibits an intermediate zoonotic potential, which is in correspondence with the current understanding of this pathogen. The result indicated that the SVM prediction models demonstrated a strong generalization ability and can be utilized to estimate the zoonotic potential of other species strains within the genusBrucella(Fig.6).

The color and position of the points indicated the species and predicted zoonotic potential of the strains, respectively. The red and blue background colors indicated the zoonotic probability density and the non-zoonotic probability density, respectively. The intensity of the background color correlated with the magnitude of the zoonotic potential.

The high similarity (~97%) at the genomic level within the genusBrucellaallows for the utilization of our pan-GWAS-based SVM prediction models among different species ofBrucellastrains and various host-derived isolates of the same species. The marine mammal-derivedBrucellae, includingB. cetiandB. pinnipedialis, have been demonstrated to have potential zoonotic capacity40. Here, nine strains ofB. cetiwere evaluated for zoonotic potential using the SVM prediction models with an average decision value of +0.36. The highest decision value of +0.57 was obtained from aB. cetistrain isolated from a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), while the lowest decision value of +0.10 was obtained from aB. cetistrain isolated from common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). Similarly, forB. pinnipedialis, the strains of this species exhibited an average decision value of +0.32. The highest decision value of +0.53 was observed in aB. pinnipedialisstrain isolated from hooded seal (Cystophora cristata), while the lowest decision value of +0.11 was observed in aB. pinnipedialisstrain isolated from harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). These findings highlight the necessity of surveilling zoonotic potential of marine mammalBrucellae. (Fig.6).

B. neotomae, first isolated from desert woodrats (Neotoma lepida) in the United States in 1957, was previously considered a non-zoonotic bacterium. However, two cases ofB. neotomaeinfected human were reported in 201714, indicating that humans may be part of its host range. The SVM prediction models predicted an average decision value of +0.17 for fiveB. neotomaestrains. Among these strains, the highest decision value was at +0.26, and the lowest decision value was at +0.03 (Fig.6).

B. microtiis the only known species capable of surviving in soil within theBrucellaspp.41. In this study, two strains ofB. microtiwere predicted to have zoonotic potential, one strain was isolated from a vole (Microtus arvalis), while the other was found in a pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae). These strains had an average decision value of +0.37. Notably, the strain ofB. microtiderived from the vole exhibited a higher decision value of +0.54 compared to the strain isolated from the pool frog, which obtained a decision value of +0.21 (Fig.6).

Apart fromB. ceti,B. pinnipedialis, andB. microti, the atypicalBrucellaspecies includeB. vulpisandB. inopinata10. Two strains ofB. vulpiswere assessed for their zoonotic potential by the SVM prediction models. The two highly similar strains ofB. vulpiswere isolated from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in 200842. As a result of their similarity, the decision values for both strains were identical, with a value of +0.15. This lack of variation in decision value made it impossible to construct a kernel density plot forB. vulpis.

A strain ofB. inopinataBO1 was isolated from the breast implant wound fluid of a 71-year-old female patient in 200843, and its zoonotic potential was predicted to be +0.076 based on the SVM prediction models. Despite theB. inopinata141012304 strain being isolated from a bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura lymma), its predicted zoonotic potential was slightly higher at +0.080 compared toB. inopinataBO1 ( + 0.076) isolated from the human patient (Fig.6).

B. suisis divided into 5 various biovars, withB. suisbv 1, 3, and 5 being used to construct the SVM prediction models. The zoonotic potential ofB. suisbv. 2 was subsequently predicted using the SVM prediction models, with an average decision value of +0.26. Additionally,B. suisbv. 4 strains obtained an average decision value of +0.42. Two distinct strains ofB. suisbv. 4 strains isolated from a reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and a wild boar were assessed for their zoonotic potential, yielding decision values of +0.29 and +0.54, respectively (Fig.6).

Statistical analysis further corroborated that the SVM prediction models provided species-specific and host-specific zoonotic potential forBrucellastrains. The results revealed that the zoonotic potential ofB. abortusandB. melitensisis significantly higher than that of most otherBrucellaspecies. Notably, the SVM prediction models provided species-specific decision values forB. melitensisstrains in the test dataset based solely on the gene features of the training samples, even in the absence of the input species information for all theBrucellastrains, which is the most virulentBrucellaspecies for humans32. Conversely, the zoonotic potential ofB. oviswas significantly lower compared toB. abortus,B. melitensis,B. suis,B. canis,B. neotomae, and marine mammalBrucellaspp. (Fig.7A, B).

AScatter plot showed the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains in the test dataset and variousBrucellaspecies strains derived from different hosts, the color of each point indicating the decision value for eachBrucellastrain.BStatistical significance of the decision value across 8Brucellaspecies. The single asterisk (*, yellow), double asterisk (**, blue), triple asterisk (***, red), and “ns” indicated statistically significant, very significant, extremely significant, and nonsignificant differences, respectively, from the permutation test.CBox plot showed the predicted zoonotic potential ofB. melitensisstrains derived from various hosts. Statistical significance of the decision values was determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test (**, P.adjust<0.01; ***, P.adjust<0.001).DBox plot showed the predicted zoonotic potential of theB. suisbv. 2 strains derived from swine or wild boar. Statistical significance of the decision values was determined by the independent samples t-test (**, P < 0.01).

Additionally,B. melitensisstrains isolated fromHomo sapiensexhibited significantly higher zoonotic potential than those isolated fromBos taurus,Capra hircus, andOvis aries(Fig.7C). Among theB. suisbv. 2 strains, the highest decision value was +0.65, isolated from a swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), while the lowest decision value was -0.04, isolated from a wild boar (Sus scrofa) (Fig.6). The considerable difference between the highest decision value and the lowest decision value indicated a need to compare the zoonotic potential ofB. suisbv. 2 strains derived from different hosts. We compared the decision values ofBrucellastrains isolated from different hosts and found that those isolated from swine exhibited significantly higher zoonotic potential than those isolated from wild boars, despite both belonging to theSus scrofaspecies (Fig.7D).

Model explanations were conducted using the SHAP method on a set of 268 genes, which served as the features for constructing the SVM prediction models. The SHAP method offers two distinct perspectives for explaining the impact of features on ML model outputs: a global explanation and a local explanation. As shown in Fig.8A, all 268 features were ranked according to the mean absolute SHAP values in the global model explanation, identifying the ten most influential features on the predicted results (Fig.8A). Furthermore, the SHAP dependence plot showed how variations in feature values (genepresent orgeneabsent) affected the predictions forBrucellastrains. The featuregroup_2874was the most significant contributor to the output of SVM prediction models, resulting in predictions towards zoonotic direction when absent and towards non-zoonotic direction when present, with a greater distance of the shift than that observed in the absence ofgroup_2874. It has been preliminarily identified as an uncharacterized protein, and currently, there is no definitive functional characterization available. This indicated thatgroup_2874was more likely to be associated with a diminished zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains (Fig.8B).

ASHAP summary bar plot showed the top 10 features in descending order of the mean SHAP absolute values.BSHAP dependence plot showed the impact of 10 features on the decision value output of the SVM prediction models. Each dot represented a singleBrucellastrain in the test dataset, with red or blue indicating that the feature was present or absent in the genome of theBrucellastrain, respectively.CSHAP force plot showed the impact of all features on the predicted results for eachBrucellastrain in the test dataset. The x-axis represented each sample, and the y-axis represented the predicted zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains, with the larger part in red indicating greater zoonotic potential of theBrucellastrains.D,ESHAP waterfall plot showed the local explanations for the typical zoonotic pathogenB. melitensis16 M strain and the non-zoonotic pathogenB. ovisATCC 25840 strain.

The predicted results for eachBrucellastrain in the test dataset were explained in Fig.8C. The upper x-axis represented each sample, while the y-axis represented the contributions of features to the predicted results. As the blue part of the sample increased, the likelihood of theBrucellastrain being pathogenic to humans was decreased (Fig.8C). In addition, the local explanation of twoBrucellastrains, including the typical zoonoticBrucellastrain (B. melitensis16 M strain, GCA_000740415.1) and non-zoonoticBrucellastrain (B. ovisATCC 25840 strain, GCA_000016845.1), provided a personalized analysis of the predicted results. For instance, the absence ofgroup_2974resulted in an increase in the predicted zoonotic potential of theB. melitensis16 M strain. In contrast, the presence ofgroup_2974in theB. ovisATCC 25840 strain decreased its predicted zoonotic potential. The local explanation clearly demonstrated the roles that various features play in the zoonotic potential prediction process for individualBrucellastrains (Fig.8D, E).

The construction of the pangenome ofBrucellaspp. provided a finer resolution insight into the genetic diversity of this zoonotic intracellular pathogen. The pangenome ofBrucellaspp. consisted of 582 core genes, 4121 accessory genes, and 2462 unique genes. The proportion of genes annotated to the L category among the unique genes was higher than that of core and accessory genes (Fig.1A). This was likely due to individualBrucellastrains facing distinct selective pressures, necessitating the retention of genes that are beneficial for their genetic information transfer, thereby ensuring their survival under such conditions. This result reflected the diversity of ecological niches inhabited byBrucellastrains. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that these 11Brucellaspecies possessed an open pangenome (Fig.1B), which was consistent with the ongoing expansion of the genusBrucella, indicating once again that pathogens belonging to theBrucellaspp. inhabited the varied ecological niches44. The coexistence of specialistBrucellastrains (such asB. melitensisandB. abortus) infecting livestock or wildlife and generalistBrucellastrains (such asB. microti) living extensively in the environment underpinned the movement of diverseBrucellastrains among the environment, animals, and humans.

Given the largely unknown zoonotic potential of novel species ofBrucellaand the emergence of human brucellosis caused byBrucellastrains previously thought to lack zoonotic capability, such asB. neotomaeconsidered a non-zoonotic species over the past years45, the understanding of the zoonotic potential ofB. neotomaehas been changed by the isolation ofB. neotomaefrom the cerebrospinal fluid of two patients diagnosed with human brucellosis in Costa Rica46. This finding necessitates a reconsideration of its host range and implications for public health. It was necessary to develop a prediction model to further characterize the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains. To establish the most effective prediction model, we conducted a comparative analysis of three distinct methods, encompassing phylogenetic analysis, unsupervised ML model, and supervised ML model. Our findings revealed that both phylogenetic analysis and unsupervised ML model were ineffective in distinguishing between artificially categorized zoonotic and non-zoonoticBrucellastrains. Conversely, supervised ML models successfully discriminated between zoonotic and non-zoonoticBrucellastrains in the test dataset. The SVM-based model exhibited superior discriminative performance on the validation dataset compared to other supervised ML models (Fig.4). Consequently, we developed SVM prediction models to obtain quantitative indicator decision values, which were then utilized for assessing the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains.

The generalization ability of ML model is a crucial metric for evaluating its performance47. This ability determines whether the developed model can maintain suitable performance for dealing with unseen data. In this study, we assessed the generalization ability of the SVM prediction models usingB. canisstrains. The SVM prediction models yielded an average decision value of +0.49 forB. canisstrains (Fig.6), ranking closely behind zoonoticBrucellaspeciesB. melitensis(+1.11) andB. abortus(+0.91) in the test dataset (Fig.5A). This precise prediction of the zoonotic potential of unseen data fromB. canisstrains indicated the strong generalization ability of the SVM prediction models. Furthermore, the SVM prediction models demonstrated a surprising efficacy in evaluating the zoonotic potential characteristics ofBrucellaspecies at both interspecific (among different species) and intraspecific (among strains of the same species) levels. Among the variousBrucellaspecies,B. melitensisis recognized as the most pathogenic, thereby establishing itself as a critical focus for zoonotic potential assessments32,48. Notably, the SVM prediction models exhibited the capability to accurately differentiateB. melitensisfrom other zoonoticBrucellaspecies, even in the absence of any species-related input data (Fig.7A, B).

Holzapfel et al. addressed the virulence ofBrucellaspecies isolated from different hosts, revealing that theB. melitensisstrains isolated from various hosts did not exhibit any host-specific characteristics. This research focused onB. melitensisstrains identified as clones, isolating these pathogens from multiple hosts during the same outbreak over a span of one year. The relatively short isolation period of merely one year may present challenges forB. melitensisin achieving effective host adaptation. This limitation may have influenced the observed relationship between host factors and the characteristics ofBrucellastrains49.Brucellahave been isolated from several bodily fluids such as urine, semen, breast milk, and blood of infected patients50–52. The transmission routes ofBrucella, such as maternal transmission, sexual contact, and blood transfusion, have been described53–55. Our findings further suggest thatB. melitensisstrains isolated from humans exhibit a higher predictive zoonotic potential. Consequently, this highlights the critical need for further investigations into the impact of diverse hosts on the virulence and zoonotic potential of strains within the sameBrucellaspecies. In addition to accurately assessing the zoonotic potential of differentBrucellaspecies, the SVM prediction models have also effectively distinguishedB. melitensisisolates from human and differentiated betweenB. suisbv. 2 strains isolated from swine and those isolated from wild boars, despite the lack of host information of isolates (Fig.7C, D). These results provide valuable insights into the impact of the host on the characteristics ofBrucellastrains.

The circulation at the wildlife-livestock interface is a prominent characteristic forB. melitensis, B. abortus, and B. suis56. As previously described, the distribution ofB. suisbv. 2 is progressively expanding from wild boars and hares to domestic pigs; this transition is particularly concerning because domestic pigs have a significantly closer association with human communities compared to wild boars, turning this pathogen, which is rarely infective to humans, into a significant public health concern57–59. Our SVM prediction models indicated that the zoonotic potential associated withB. suisbv. 2 from domestic pigs is greater than that from wild boars. Therefore, it is essential to implement continuous monitoring ofB. suisbv. 2 within animal husbandry to find the potential risk of host jumps targeting humans in the future. These findings indicate that the predictions made by the SVM prediction models are informative.

The zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains varies among different species. Human brucellosis is commonly caused by threeBrucellaspecies transmitted from animals to humans:B. melitensis,B. abortus, andB. suisbv. 1 and 3. However, the zoonotic potential of novel members of the genusBrucella, such asB. ceti,B. pinnipedialis,B. inopinata,B. microti,B. vulpis, andB. suisbv. 2 and 4 remains largely unknown, despite the fact that some strains of certainBrucellaspecies have been isolated from patients with brucellosis. The predicted zoonotic potential indicated the necessity for ongoing monitoring among theseBrucellaspecies. Due to the limited number of available genomes for theseBrucellaspecies, the prediction results generated by the SVM prediction models may not fully characterize the true zoonotic potential of these species. In the future, the performance of the SVM prediction models could be enhanced by increasing the WGS data forBrucella.

As an effective ML model explanation tool, the SHAP method identified 10 genes that are most important to evaluate the zoonotic potential of theBrucellastrain in SVM prediction models. The genegroup_1020encodes a protein belonging to the pentapeptide MXKDX repeat protein family, and this gene was annotated as “Reduced virulence” (http://www.phi-base.org), which suggests that the gene may enhance the virulence of pathogen. The genegroup_1603was predicted encodes ATPase component belong to ABC-type transport system and was also annotated as “Reduced virulence”, ABC transporter plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis and virulence60. In addition to the top 10 genes, the genegroup_4450encodes urea transporter, which has been observed to be up-regulated during the acid stress response forB. melitensis16 M61. Given that the consumption of contaminated food is a common transmission route forBrucella, this observation suggests thatgroup_4450may play an important role in aidingBrucellastrains in resisting the acidic environments within the host stomach, thereby facilitating the establishment of infection.

The dataset used for training the SVM prediction models is imbalanced, with the number of zoonoticBrucellastrains exceeding that of non-zoonoticBrucellastrains. This discrepancy may result in an overestimation of the predicted zoonotic potential forBrucellastrains62. To mitigate the sample imbalance, SVMSMOTE was performed to alleviate the skewed class distribution of the training dataset. Furthermore, the MCC score was adopted to assess the performance of ML models, thereby improving the reliability of the results. Although there remains a risk of overestimating zoonotic potential for SVM prediction models, it is more important from a public health perspective to avoid misclassifying zoonoticBrucellastrains as non-zoonotic; such errors may result in undetected brucellosis outbreaks and pose a serious threat to public health.

Currently, the prediction of zoonotic potential based on ML utilizing genomic data is typically conducted within the same species for bacteria63,64. Our study achieves cross-species zoonotic potential predictions using ML on multiple highly conservedBrucellaspecies, demonstrating the applicability of ML to predict zoonotic potential in bacterial pathogens with greater genetic variability. However, an anticipated challenge is that as genetic variability increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to capture sufficient information from the genomes. Relying solely on the presence or absence of genes may become inadequate for predicting zoonotic potential in bacterial pathogens with greater genetic variability. It is therefore necessary to provide ML with more information at the nucleotide-level, which can capture additional genetic variations such as Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Insertions and Deletions (Indels). SNPs have been shown to grant bacteria the ability to infect new host species or acquire antibiotic resistance65,66, highlighting the risk that gene-level analyses may miss important trait-associated information. Thus, integrating both gene-level and nucleotide-level features in future studies may improve the accuracy of zoonotic potential prediction for bacterial pathogens with high genetic variability.

In conclusion, we successfully combined pan-GWAS with ML to predict the zoonotic potential of closely related bacteria within the genusBrucella. Among the 11Brucellaspecies, most strains were predicted to be potential zoonotic pathogens. The SVM prediction models delivered species-specific and host-specific predictions of zoonotic potential for these closely related bacteria isolated from various hosts. This technical framework offers a viable analytical method for predicting the zoonotic potential of the closely related bacterial pathogens at the host resolution.

A total of 1042 assembled genomes from 11 differentBrucellaspecies were downloaded from NCBI Assembly database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly). The quality of these genomes was checked byQUAST, and a total of 991Brucellagenomes were considered to be of acceptable quality67. The visualization of species and host source information pertaining to these 991Brucellastrains was generated using the CNSknowall platform (https://cnsknowall.com), a comprehensive web service for data analysis and visualization (Supplementary Table1). The annotation of 991 quality-passed genomes was performed using Prokka, a bioinformatics tool for annotating prokaryotic genome (https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)68. The pan-genome analysis was performed by Roary (https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary)69. The COG annotation was conducted using the online web service eggNOG-mapper v2 (http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de)70. A Python script was used to calculate Heap’s law to characterize the openness of theBrucellapangenome (Supplementary Data2). To classifyBrucellastrains according to their zoonotic potential,B. abortus,B. melitensis, and part ofB. suis(biovar 1 and biovar 3) strains were assigned to the zoonotic group71.B. ovisandB. suisbiovar 5 strains were assigned to the non-zoonotic group17,72. Additionally, the vaccine strainsB. abortus104 M andB. suisS2 were also assigned to the non-zoonotic group73,74. Subsequent to annotating the zoonotic potential information for theBrucellastrains, the pan-GWAS tool Scoary was used to identify statistically significant associated genes with either zoonotic or non-zoonotic groups (P.adjust<0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg method) and these genes were used to build the input binarized dataset (Supplementary Data1)75.

The maximum-likelihood tree based on the core genes was constructed using raxmlGUIv2.0 (https://antonellilab.github.io/raxmlGUI)76, the model was set to GTR + G and the reliability of the internal branch was evaluated using 200 bootstrap replicates. The resulting phylogenetic tree was modified using tvBOT (https://www.chiplot.online/tvbot.html)77. The PCA on the input binarized dataset was performed using the Scikit-learn Python package (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). The K-Means clustering and DBSCAN clustering models were built on the PCA transformed input binarized dataset using the Scikit-learn and SciPy Python package (https://scipy.org). All figures were plotted using the Matplotlib Python packages (https://matplotlib.org).

The binarized dataset was used to develop a supervised ML model aimed at generating predictions for the zoonotic potential ofBrucellastrains. Five different supervised ML algorithms (RF, DTC, SVM, KNN, and MLP) were used to build the prediction models. Due to the limited number of non-zoonoticBrucellastrain samples, a stratified sampling approach was employed to allocate training and test datasets in a 50-50% split for the input binarized dataset. To tackle the class imbalance problem, the imbalanced-learn Python package was utilized to perform SVM Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SVMSMOTE) for oversampling on the training dataset, ensuring an adequate representation of non-zoonoticBrucellastrain samples for training the ML model. Hyperparameter optimization for the ML model was carried out using a grid search with 3-fold cross-validation, with the evaluation score set as the MCC score. The ML model was trained on the training dataset using the optimal hyperparameters identified from the grid search: H1(class_weight = ‘balanced’, C = 0.005, degree = 0, kernel = ‘rbf’), H2(class_weight = ‘balanced’, C = 0.005, degree = 10, kernel = ‘poly’), and H3(class_weight = ‘balanced’, C = 0.005, degree = 1, kernel = ‘poly’). Its performance was then evaluated on the test dataset. To mitigate potential random sampling errors, the sample split, model establishment, and validation process were repeated 100 times for different algorithms. The performance of the ML models established with different algorithms was evaluated based on various metrics, including Accuracy score, Recall score, F1 score, AUC score, AUPRC score, and MCC score, calculated as the average of all 100 repetitions. The sample split and ML model establishment were executed using the Scikit-learn Python package.

After identifying SVM as the algorithm for establishing the zoonotic potential prediction model, the hyperparameters of the models with MCC scores in the top 10% were extracted from the results of the grid search. Three distinct SVM prediction models were subsequently developed using these optimal hyperparameters: H1, H2, and H3. For eachBrucellastrain sample, the decision value is calculated as the average of the raw decision_function outputs from these three SVM models. The SciPy Python package was used to conduct Gaussian kernel density estimation of predicted probabilities for the strains in the test dataset and various species of the genusBrucella. The kernel density plot was generated using the Matplotlib Python package.

The oversampled training dataset was clustered into 100 weighted samples via K-Means clustering and employed as background samples for the SHAP method. Each SVM prediction model used the kernel SHAP method to explain decision values, followed by averaging SHAP values across all models to derive the final output. Feature importance was assessed by ranking the averaged SHAP values, and both global and local explanations were constructed using the shap Python package (https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest). The pathogenicity of genes was annotated using PHIB-BLAST on the Pathogen-Host Interactions database (PHI-base,http://www.phi-base.org).

Statistical significance was determined by independent samples t-test for the decision values ofB. suisbiovar 2 strains isolated from swine or wild boar, which conformed to normal distribution. Since the decision values of the eightBrucellaspecies did not all conform to normal distribution and someBrucellaspecies have small sample sizes, permutation test was performed to determine interspecies statistical significance, with p values were corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The decision values forB. melitensisstrains isolated from different hosts did not conform to normal distribution, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine statistical significance with p values were corrected by the Bonferroni method. All p values described in the study are two-sided. The independent samples t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Bonferroni method were performed using BONC DSS Statistics 25 software. The permutation test and Benjamini-Hochberg method were performed using SciPy Python package.
