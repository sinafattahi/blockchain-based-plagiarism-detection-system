Poplar 741has significant ecological and economic value and is widely used. This study developed an efficient regeneration system using sterilePoplar 741leaves as explants to directly induce adventitious buds. The effects of exogenous hormone concentration (6-Benzylaminopurine: 0, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/L), type, Thidiazuron pre-treatment duration, culture medium type, and leaf position (upper, middle, or lower) on leaf regeneration were investigated. Endogenous hormone content, physiological indices, microscopic observations, and transcriptome sequencing analyses were conducted.Results showed that the highest adventitious bud induction was achieved in Murashige and Skoog medium with 1.0 mg/L 6-BA, 0.05 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid, and 0.01 mg/L TDZ, reaching an 85% adventitious bud adventitious bud induction rate. Upper leaves pre-treated with TDZ for 6 days were most effective. Endogenous hormone content and microscopic properties under different treatments matched the regeneration system. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. Core genes identified werePTI5,LBD1, andWERfor 6-BA, TDZ, and leaf position treatments, respectively. Cellular status during pre-culture showed the highest Synthesis phase cell proportion on day 3, with Gap 2/Mitosis phase cells appearing from day 4. Key cell cycle S-phase gene expression peaked on day 3. β-Glucuronidase staining was highest on days 0, 2, and 3. Day 3 of pre-culture was identified as the optimal time for genetic transformation, with a transient transformation efficiency of up to 68%. This study provides a theoretical and technical basis for poplar regeneration and genetic transformation, offering insights for future forestry biotechnology applications.

In molecular biology and genetics studies of woody plants,Populusserves as a model genus owing to its ease of in vitro manipulation and relatively small genome size [1,2].Poplar 741constitutes an improved cultivar amenable to genetic transformation, characterized by reduced catkin production, superior wood properties, rapid volumetric growth, straight trunks, and broad adaptability to diverse planting zones [3–5]. This establishes its utility for ornamental landscaping, roadside greening, and fast-growing timber plantations.An efficient regeneration system is foundational forPoplar 741genetic transformation, enabling enhancement of desirable traits through molecular breeding. Regeneration efficiency depends critically on explant selection, culture medium composition, and the homeostasis between exogenous and endogenous hormones, with explant developmental stage critically determining regeneration capacity [6,7]. Tissue culture success is predominantly governed by basal medium selection. Commonly employed basal media include Woody Plant Medium (WPM), Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, and ½MS medium– all providing essential​inorganic nutrients. Medium modifications are contingent upon experimental objectives and explant type [8]. Moreover, regeneration efficiency is profoundly influenced by exogenous hormone concentrations, types, and combinatorial ratios. Hormonal requirements for adventitious shoot induction depend on endogenous hormone equilibrium, with both systems coordinately regulating fundamental processes including cell division, differentiation, elongation, root formation, germination, abscission,anddormancy [9].Genetic transformation efficiency in Populus exhibits direct correlation with pre-culture duration, which establishes an optimal cellular competency window. The plant cell cycle—spanning from mitosis completion to subsequent division—comprises two principal phases: interphase (G1, S, G2) [10] and mitotic phase (M phase) [11,12].Critically, genetic transformation efficiency correlates directly with pre-culture duration, defining an optimal cellular receptivity period. Empirical evidence demonstrates species-specific variation: peak efficiency occurs after 3-day (leaves) and 4-day (stems) pre-culture inPopulus×euramericana'84 K', compared to 2 days inNicotiana tabacumleaves [13] .

Differential developmental trajectories in explant-derived leaf bud primordia contribute to transformation variability. Transformation efficiency shows significant correlation with cellular developmental stages in explants, reaching maximum efficacy when shoot primordia cells enter S-phase. Given the phase-specific influence of target cell cycle stages across plant species, precise temporal monitoring of cellular development during pre-culture—exemplified by flow cytometry—is essential [14–16]. Notably,Poplar 741transformation faces three persistent bottlenecks: low leaf regeneration capacity, suboptimal transformation efficiency, and protracted genetic modification timelines.

The hybridPoplar 741is obtained through sexual hybridization as follows: {Populus alba×Populus davidiana+Populus simonii]} + {Populus tomentosa}). Explants ofPoplar 741were collected from the nursery of the West Campus of Hebei Agricultural University.Collect sprouting stem segments (5-8 cm in length and 2-3 mm in diameter) during the spring new shoot germination period, and select young, fresh green leaves without wilting or browning of the incision as explants.After sterilization of the segments and their tissue culture propagation, sterile seedlings were obtained.

Based on the optimal plant growth regulator conditions (Sect. 2.2.1.1), TDZ treatments of different durations (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days) were set. The explants were cultured as described in Sect. 2.2.1.1 to determine the optimal duration for adventitious bud induction inPoplar 741leaves. This experiment employed a single-factor experimental design, with 20 explants per treatment and three replicates. The bud adventitious bud induction rate was calculated 30 days after inoculation.

Based on the optimal culture conditions determined in Sect. 2.2.1.1, we tested woody plant medium(WPM), Murashige and Skoog(MS), and Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) media for their ability to induce adventitious bud formation inPoplar 741leaves. The explants were cultured as described in Sect. 2.2.1.1. A single-factor experimental design was used, with 20 explants per treatment and three replicates. The bud adventitious bud induction rate was calculated 30 days after inoculation.

Fully expanded leaves from the apical bud of tissue-cultured, rootedPoplar 741seedlings were designated as position 1, with subsequent leaves numbered sequentially downward (position 2, 4, 6, etc.). A single-factor experimental design was employed, with 20 explants per treatment and three replicates. The bud adventitious bud induction rate was calculated 30 days after inoculation.

Samples were collected from leaves subjected to different 6-BA concentrations, leaf positions, and TDZ treatment durations at the onset of bud point emergence. A single leaf was selected per treatment, with three biological replicates. Three representative samples were used to determine the optimal 6-BA concentration, as follows: 0 mg/L (B1), 1.0 mg/L (B2), and 2.0 mg/L (B3). For TDZ treatments, three representative samples were selected to test durations of 0 days (T1), 6 days (T2), and 10 days (T3). Leaf positions included the second leaf (L1), fourth leaf (L2), and sixth leaf (L6). Hormone contents were detected externally in all samples by Suzhou GenThink Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, China).

Poplar 741leaves that were fully expanded, slightly thick, of similar size, and located just below the apical bud of the rooted seedlings, were selected. The leaves were removed from the culture vessel, their tips were cut off, and a portion of the petiole was retained. The remaining leaf tissue was cut transversely along the midrib to create two wounds, placed flat on the pre-culture medium, and cultured under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. The culture temperature was maintained at 23 ± 2 °C. Samples were collected on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 at the same time point each day, with the 0-day treatment considered as the control group.

The processed leaves were inoculated onto the pre-culture medium and cultured for 0–4 days. Changes in the leaf wounds and petioles at different culture times were observed using a stereomicroscope. Each treatment included 20 leaves, with three replicates.

Flow cytometry was used to distinguish the cell cycle phases. Three to five leaves were collected, and the tissue surrounding the wounds was cut off and chopped. The samples were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with the nucleic acid dye propidium iodide. Fluorescence detection was performed using a flow cytometer. Interphase (G1, S, and G2 phases) and the mitotic zone (M phase) were identified using Flomax 2.8 software.

The tissue surrounding the leaf wounds was excised from leaves in each treatment group and ground in liquid nitrogen. This process was repeated three times. Cyclin gene primers (PtoCYCD6, PtoCDKD1, PtoCDKB1, and PtoCYCH1) were designed using Primer Premier 6.0 software, using PtoActin as the internal reference gene. RNA was extracted from leaves cultured for different durations and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using RNA extraction and reverse transcription kits (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, qRT-PCR was performed using cDNA as the template. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method.

Three key factors during the regeneration process, the 6-BA concentration, TDZ pre-treatment duration, and leaf position, were selected for transcriptome sequencing. The seven treatments were as follows: B1 (0 mg/L 6-BA), B2 (1.0 mg/L 6-BA), B3 (2.0 mg/L 6-BA), T1 (0 days of TDZ pre-treatment), T2 (6 days of TDZ pre-treatment), W1 (middle leaves), and W2 (lower leaves). Each treatment contained three leaf replicates, resulting in 21 sequenced samples. The leaf selection criteria were consistent with those described in Sect. 1.2.3. Library construction and transcriptome sequencing analysis were completed externally by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China).

Raw sequencing reads obtained through Illumina sequencing were filtered to obtain high-quality clean reads. The expression levels of all genes in each sample were calculated using RSEM software and expressed as fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments (FPKM). DEGs between groups were identified using DESeq2, based on the criteria|log2(fold change)|> 1 and a false discovery rate < 0.05. A functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed using annotation information from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases.

The regulatory relationships between transcription factors and genes were explored by constructing multilayer gene regulatory networks associated with leaf budding under three different treatments, following methods described in previous studies [17]. DEGs from key pathways identified in transcriptome analysis were used as input genes at the bottom layer, and all differentially expressed transcription factors were used as input genes at the top layer. A bottom-up Gaussian graphical model (GGM) algorithm was employed to construct the networks. This approach allows the integration of multiple layers of molecular data and the reconstruction of intricate regulatory networks.

Leaf regeneration, transformation, and physiological data were statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 and visualized using Origin 2021. Transcriptome analysis was performed using the Omicsmart online tool. Gene co-expression network diagrams were constructed using Cytoscape.

Leaves from differentiated seedlings were inoculated onto nine different culture treatments according to the study’s L9 orthogonal array design(Supplementary Table 1). The results of adventitious bud induction obtained from the leaves after 30 days of culture are shown in Fig.1A and Supplementary Table 2. The induction of leaves from differentiated seedlings was poor, with a adventitious bud induction rate of zero for all treatments except H5 and H7. The highest adventitious bud induction rate (41.33%) was obtained in treatment H5. These results indicated that leaves from differentiated seedlings are not conducive to adventitious bud induction.

Leaves from 20-day-old rooted seedlings were likewise inoculated onto nine different culture treatments according to the L9 orthogonal array design. The results of adventitious bud induction from the leaves are shown in Fig.1B and Supplementary Table 3. There were significant differences among the treatments, with the highest adventitious bud induction rate (82.33%) obtained in treatment F3. The total number of adventitious buds (80.67) in that treatment was significantly higher than in all other treatments, indicating significant effects of 6-BA, IAA, and TDZ on bud induction in Poplar 741. Thus, the optimal combination of exogenous hormones for adventitious bud induction in Poplar 741 leaves was 1.0 mg/L 6-BA + 0.05 mg/L IAA + 0.01 mg/L TDZ (Fig.1D).

Because the optimal combination was not included in the nine treatments of the orthogonal array design, a comparison experiment was conducted between this combination (F3 +) and the best combination derived from the nine treatments (F3) (Fig.1C). The adventitious bud induction rate obtained with F3 + reached 85%, with more and greener adventitious buds obtained than in F3. Therefore, the optimal medium for adventitious bud induction in Poplar 741 leaves was MS + 1.0 6-BA mg/L + 0.05 mg/L IAA + 0.01 mg/L TDZ.

Previous experiments showed that TDZ played a significant role in the differentiation of Poplar 741 leaves. Adventitious bud induction was promoted by an appropriate pre-treatment duration, but was inhibited when that time frame was greatly exceeded. Our results showed a significant increase in the leaf adventitious bud induction rate with increasing TDZ pre-treatment duration (Fig.2A, B). Leaf adventitious bud induction rates and the total number of adventitious buds differed significantly among the treatments. For TDZ (0.01 mg/L), the optimal pre-treatment duration was 6 days, which resulted in a leaf adventitious bud induction rate of up to 83.67% and 103.33 adventitious buds. The buds were relatively small and exhibited white callus formation and leaf swelling.

To determine the effect of culture medium type on leaf differentiation, results were compared for three common media (WPM, MS, and LS). Under the same hormone combination, a maximum leaf adventitious bud induction rate of 84.67% and 88.67 adventitious buds were obtained with MS medium (Fig.2C, D). The buds were mostly solitary, with longer stems and swollen cuts. The leaf adventitious bud induction rate and total number of adventitious buds were significantly higher in MS than in LS medium. Considering the adventitious bud induction rate, the number of differentiated buds, and the growth state of the buds, the optimal culture medium was MS + 1.0 6-BA mg/L + 0.05 mg/L IAA + 0.01 mg/L TDZ.

The second, fourth, and sixth leaves (L2, L4, L6) were selected from 20-day-old rooted seedlings of Poplar 741 and inoculated into the optimized culture medium. After 30 days of culture, a maximum adventitious bud induction rate of 84.67% and 87.33 adventitious buds were obtained with L2 (Fig.2E, F). These values were significantly higher than those obtained with the other leaves. The adventitious buds were mostly clustered, with swollen cuts and earlier bud point appearance.

In summary, during the induction of adventitious buds in Poplar 741 leaves, optimal results were achieved by culturing the second leaf from the morphological upper end (L2) in MS medium, with 10 days of TDZ pre-treatment (T10).

The concentration of exogenous 6-BA significantly influenced endogenous hormone levels during leaf regeneration. The cytokinin zeatin (ZT) promotes cell division, delays plant senescence, and maintains cell vitality. The effects of different 6-BA concentrations on endogenous ZT levels in leaves are shown in Fig.3A. The ZT content increased as the 6-BA concentration increased and was lowest in the B1 treatment (0 mg/L 6-BA) and highest in the B3 treatment (2.0 mg/L 6-BA). Differences in ZT content among the three treatments were significant. These findings suggested that 6-BA promotes the synthesis of ZT in leaves.

The division of cambial cells is stimulated by the auxin IAA. The impact of the 6-BA concentration on the leaf IAA content is shown in Fig.3B. As the 6-BA concentration increased, the IAA content initially increased and then decreased. The IAA content was lowest in the B1 treatment (0 mg/L 6-BA) and highest in the B2 treatment (1.0 mg/L 6-BA). Differences in the IAA content among the three treatments were significant. These results indicated that IAA synthesis in leaves was promoted by 6-BA but inhibited by excessively high 6-BA concentrations.

Abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits plant growth, suppresses cell division, and accelerates plant senescence. The effects of 6-BA concentration on leaf ABA content are shown in Fig.3C. As the 6-BA concentration increased, the ABA content initially decreased and then increased. The ABA content was lowest in the B2 treatment (1.0 mg/L 6-BA) and highest in the B1 treatment (0 mg/L 6-BA). Thus, while 6-BA treatment inhibited ABA synthesis in leaves, the inhibitory effect was weaker at higher 6-BA concentrations.

Microscopic observations of the effects of 6-BA concentration on leaf regeneration are shown in Fig.3D–F. On day 9, callus formation was observed at cut sites on B2 leaves (Fig.3E), whereas no callus formation was observed in B1 leaves (Fig.3D) or B3 (Fig.3F). On day 12, bud primordia were visible in B2 leaves, whereas they appeared later in B1 and B3 leaves. By day 27, adventitious buds were longer and more numerous in B2 leaves than in B1 and B3 leaves, which resulted in fewer and shorter adventitious buds.

Our comprehensive analysis revealed that among the different treatments, the B2 treatment showed high ZT content, the highest IAA content, and the lowest ABA content. During regeneration, callus and bud primordium formation occurred earlier in the B2 treatment, and more and longer adventitious buds were produced. Therefore, a 6-BA concentration of 1.0 mg/L was deemed the optimal concentration for leaf regeneration in Poplar 741.

The effects of different TDZ pre-treatment durations on endogenous hormone content during leaf regeneration differed significantly. The ZT content increased gradually with increasing TDZ pre-treatment days (Fig.4A), with the lowest content obtained in the T0 treatment and the highest in the T10 treatment. This result indicates that TDZ pre-treatment promotes the synthesis of ZT. The IAA content first increased and then decreased as the number of TDZ pre-treatment days increased (Fig.4B), with the lowest content in the T0 treatment and the highest in the T6 treatment. This result suggests faster leaf differentiation in the T6 treatment than in the T0 treatment, because TDZ pre-treatment promotes IAA synthesis. The ABA content decreased sharply with increasing TDZ pre-treatment duration (Fig.4C). Significant reductions in ABA in the T6 and T10 treatments and the highest ABA content in the T0 treatment indicated that TDZ pre-treatment accelerates leaf differentiation by inhibiting the synthesis of ABA.

Microscopic observations of the effects of different TDZ pre-treatment durations on leaf regeneration are shown in Fig.4D–F. On day 9, callus formation was observed at the cut sites of leaves treated with T6 (Fig.4E), whereas no callus formation was observed in leaves treated with T0 (Fig.4D) or T10 (Fig.4F). On day 12, bud primordia were visible in T6-treated leaves, but they appeared later in T0- and T10-treated leaves. By day 27, T6 leaves had produced more adventitious buds than T0- and T10-treated leaves.

Our comprehensive analysis revealed that in the T6 treatment group, the ZT and IAA contents were higher and the ABA content was lower than in the other treatments, although differences between the T6 and T10 groups were not significant. During regeneration, callus and bud primordia formation occurred earlier in the T6 treatment, which resulted in more and longer adventitious buds. Therefore, 6 days was deemed the optimal TDZ pre-treatment duration for leaf regeneration in Poplar 741.

The effects of leaf position on endogenous hormone content during leaf regeneration were significant. The ZT content initially increased but then decreased from upper to lower leaves (Fig.5A). The ZT content was lowest in the L6 treatment and highest in the L4 treatment, indicating that middle and upper leaves were more conducive than lower leaves to ZT synthesis. The IAA content increased progressively from upper to lower leaves (Fig.5B), and was lowest in the L2 treatment and highest in the L6 treatment. These results indicate the accumulation of auxin from the top downward toward the base. The ABA content also increased progressively from upper to lower leaves (Fig.5C), and was lowest in the L2 treatment and highest in the L6 treatment. Thus, lower leaves were more conducive to ABA synthesis than middle and upper leaves.

Microscopic observations of the effects of the leaf position on leaf regeneration are shown in Fig.5D–F. On day 9, callus formation was observed at the cut sites of L2 leaves (Fig.5D), but not in L4 and L6 leaves (Fig.5E, F). On day 12, bud primordia were visible in L2 leaves but appeared later in L4 and L6 leaves. By day 27, L2 leaves had produced more adventitious buds than L4 and L6 leaves.

Our comprehensive analysis revealed higher ZT content and lower IAA and ABA contents in the L2 group. During regeneration, callus and bud primordia formation occurred earlier in L2 leaves, accompanied by the production of more and longer adventitious buds. Therefore, the second leaf from the top (L2) was optimal for leaf regeneration in Poplar 741.

During the Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of woody plants, the physiological state of the cells plays a crucial role in their uptake of foreign genes. Determination of the optimal time frame for transformation can significantly enhance transformation efficiency. In this study, green, robust rooted Poplar 741 leaves were selected, the leaf tips were removed, and part of the petiole was retained. Two transverse cuts were made along the midrib, after which the leaves were cultured on pre-culture medium and morphological changes were observed at different time points (Fig.6A). The results showed that from 0 to 2 days, the Poplar 741 leaves remained flat and moist, with green cut sites. On day 3, the cut sites of the apical buds gradually turned red, and on day 4, they began to show signs of drying and curling.

Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle stages of Poplar 741 leaves cultured for different durations (Fig.6B). At 0 days of treatment, G1- and S-phase cells accounted for 96.15% and 3.85% of cells, respectively. As the culture duration increased, the proportion of S-phase cells increased and then decreased, with the highest proportion (8.94%) observed on day 3. G2/M-phase cells began to appear on day 4, accounting for 3.93%, while the proportion of S-phase cells declined to 8.77%.G2/M-phase cells, representing cells entering mitosis, first appeared on day 4 (3.93%), suggesting the initiation of cell division after initial adaptation to the culture conditions.

These findings indicate that the optimal pre-culture duration for genetic transformation in Poplar 741 leaves is 3 days, as it resulted in the highest proportion of S-phase cells and thus efficient genetic transformation.

The expression levels of four key genes associated with the S-phase of the cell cycle were analyzed using qRT-PCR in Poplar 741 leaves during 0–4 days of differentiation culture. As shown in Fig.7, the expression patterns of these genes varied across different time points. Expression of the cyclin gene PtoCYCD6 increased on day 1, decreased on day 2, rapidly rose again on day 3, and declined on day 4. PtoCDKD1 expression decreased on day 1, gradually increased on days 2 and 3, and then decreased on day 4. PtoCDKB1 decreased from day 0 to day 2, rapidly increased on day 3, and sharply declined on day 4. The expression of PtoCYCH1 rapidly increased on day 1, decreased on day 2, and then increased again. Despite the diverse expression patterns of these genes during the pre-culture of Poplar 741 leaves, all reached peak expression levels on day 3. This finding suggests that day 3 is a critical period for S-phase gene expression, during which leaf mesophyll cells likely reach an active physiological state.

Circular leaf discs (diameter: 6 mm) punched from Poplar 741 leaves were placed on pre-culture medium and cultured for 0–4 days. The PBI121 overexpression vector containing the GUS gene was used for genetic transformation,uninfected 741 wild-type leaves were used as controls (Fig.8A). Transient transformation efficiency was evaluated based on GUS staining, where β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme activity cleaves the substrate X-Gluc to produce a blue insoluble product, allowing visual detection of T-DNA transient expression(Fig.8B). Uninfected 741 leaves did not turn blue, whereas infected leaves exhibited clear blue staining at callus sites, with the most intense coloration observed at the vein cut sites of the callus. The staining rates were highest on days 0, 2, and 3 (70%, 73.33%, and 68%, respectively) and lowest on day 4 (54.70%) of pre-culture.

Preliminary observations of hormone content and microscopic analysis of leaf regeneration under different treatments in Poplar 741 showed that regeneration was influenced by 6-BA concentration, TDZ pre-treatment duration, and leaf position. Therefore, dynamic changes in gene expression that occurred in response to the respective treatments were investigated through transcriptome analysis using high-throughput sequencing technology. The nine treatments included B1–B3 (0, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/L 6-BA, respectively), T0, T6, and T10 (0, 6, and 10 days of TDZ pre-treatment, respectively), and L2, L4, and L6 (second, fourth, and sixth leaf, respectively). Each treatment contained three leaf replicates. After data filtering, the clean data accounted for 99.09–99.50% of the raw data, with Q20 > 96.55%, Q30 > 91.01%, and GC content ranging from 43.20% to 44.43%. The alignment rate of each sample sequence with the Poplar 741 reference genome was > 96.44. These reliability and quality control results allowed for subsequent analysis.

Differences in gene expression in leaves under different 6-BA concentrations, TDZ pre-treatment durations, and leaf positions were explored in a DEG analysis conducted across six comparison groups (B2 vs. B1, B3 vs. B1, T10 vs. T0, T6 vs. T0, L2 vs. L4, and L2 vs. L6) (Fig.9A, C, E). Shared and unique DEGs among the groups were also examined (Fig.9B, D, F). DEGs were identified using DESeq2 (v1.34.0) with|log₂FC|≥ 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as thresholds.The 6-BA treatments had the most DEGs, followed by the TDZ and leaf position treatments. DEG annotations for the different treatments in Poplar 741 were further explored in GO and KEGG enrichment analyses.

DEGs from the six groups were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, and the top 20 enriched pathways were determined by ranking P values from lowest to highest (Supplementary Figs.1and2). KEGG enrichment analysis showed that all six groups were enriched in the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, metabolic, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways (Fig.10). Several key pathways, such as plant hormone signal transduction, ZT biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis, were also enriched in multiple comparison groups.

GO enrichment analysis showed that catalytic activity was enriched in all groups except L2 vs. L6. Multiple groups were enriched in carbohydrate and small-molecule metabolic processes.

In two of the 6-BA comparisons, the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, plant MAPK signaling, and cysteine and methionine metabolism KEGG pathways were enriched. The plant hormone signal transduction, ZT biosynthesis, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways were enriched in the B2 vs. B1 group, and ABC transporters, photosynthesis, and cutin, suberine, and wax biosynthesis were enriched in the B3 vs. B1 group. GO enrichment analysis revealed that two comparison groups were significantly enriched in carbohydrate, sulfur, and small-molecule metabolic processes. Oxoacid, organic acid, and carboxylic acid metabolic processes, as well as L-phenylalanine and erythrose 4-phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid catabolic processes and photosystem II oxygen evolving complex were significantly enriched in the B3 vs. B1 group.

KEGG pathway analysis also showed that plant hormone signal transduction, ZT biosynthesis, and plant MAPK signaling pathways were enriched in two of the TDZ comparisons. Flavonoid, tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, as well as plant circadian rhythm processes were enriched in the T6 vs. T0 group, and vitamin B6 and selenocompound metabolism, as well as photosynthesis antenna proteins were enriched in the T10 vs. T0 group. GO enrichment analysis showed that two groups were significantly enriched in tyrosine and small-molecule metabolic processes and alpha-amino acid catabolic processes. The T6 vs. T0 group was significantly enriched in tyrosine metabolic and catabolic processes, as well as small-molecule catabolic process, and the T10 vs. T0 group was enriched in tyrosine, sulfur compound, and alpha-amino acid metabolic processes.

Among the leaf position comparisons, KEGG pathways related to starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were enriched in two groups. Pathways related to carotenoid, flavone, and flavenol biosynthesis and tryptophan metabolism were enriched in the L2 vs. L4 group, and those related to flavonoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism were enriched in the L2 vs. L6 group. GO enrichment analysis showed that two groups were enriched in oxidoreductase, hydrolase activity, oxygen as an electron acceptor, enzymes acting on metal ions and glycosyl bonds, and O-glycosyl compound hydrolysis. In the L2 vs. L4 group, cellular ion and chemical homeostasis and endosperm development were enriched, and in the L2 vs. L6 group, positive and negative regulation of helicase activity and negative regulation of DNA duplex unwinding were significantly enriched.

Key pathways identified in the KEGG enrichment analysis were investigated further to identify the critical regulatory genes underlying changes in leaf physiology under the different treatments. In several treatment groups, DEGs in plant hormone signal transduction pathways were significantly enriched (Fig.11), including signal transduction processes, tryptophan metabolism, and ZT and carotenoid biosynthesis, all of which are closely related to auxin, cytokinin, and ABA activity.

Tryptophan metabolism is closely related to auxin synthesis, as tryptophan is an important precursor for auxin biosynthesis in plants. More DEGs were identified in the B2 vs. B1 group than in the B3 vs. B1 group (Fig.11); in both, multiple auxin response factor-related genes, including AUX1, AUX/IAA, GH3, and SAUR, were significantly downregulated. ARF-related genes were differentially expressed only in the B3 vs. B1 group. In the TDZ group, more ARF-related DEGs were upregulated in the T6 vs. T0 group than in the T10 vs. T0 group. Among leaf position comparisons, DEGs related to AUX1 and AUX/IAA were detected only in the L2 vs. L6 group, and all were downregulated.

ZT is an important cytokinin, and its signal transduction plays a significant role in plant cell division. A-ARR (a negative regulator of cytokinin) was downregulated in the 6-BA groups. In the TDZ groups, CRE1 (a cytokinin receptor) and AHP (a phosphotransfer protein in the cytokinin signaling pathway) were upregulated in T6 vs. T0, whereas A-ARR was downregulated. In the T10 vs. T0 group, AHP was downregulated and A-ARR was upregulated.

The signal transduction process of carotenoid biosynthesis involves ABA receptors and is closely related to ABA synthesis. In the B2 vs. B1 group, the ABA receptors PYR/PYL were downregulated, as were multiple SnRK2s, which are positive regulators in ABA signaling, while PP2C, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, was upregulated. In the B3 vs. B1 group, the opposite expression trend was observed. In the TDZ groups, one SnRK2 was downregulated in the T6 vs. T0 group, whereas one ABF (an ABA signaling regulator) was upregulated in the T10 vs. T0 group.

ZT is the most active and widespread naturally occurring cytokinin, and the ZT biosynthesis pathway is involved in leaf initiation and bud differentiation. In this study, ZT-related DEGs in the 6-BA groups were enriched in processes related to the synthesis of enzymes such as isoprenoid diphosphate synthase (IPT), cis-zeatin O-glucosyltransferase (CISZOG), and cytokinin oxidase (CKX). IPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in ZT biosynthesis, CISZOG is essential for cis-zeatin synthesis, and CKX is the primary enzyme for cytokinin degradation. In the 6-BA groups, two IPT-related genes were initially downregulated but then upregulated. Multiple CKX3, CKX6, and CKX7 genes were upregulated, with significant upregulation of several CKX1 and CKX5-related DEGs in the B2 group (Fig.12).

In the TDZ pre-treatment duration groups, ZOX1 (a positive regulator of cytokinin deficiency) and CKX-related DEGs were downregulated.

Based on the identification and functional annotation of DEGs, a three-layer, bottom-up regulatory network diagram was constructed using the GGM algorithm. In the 6-BA groups, genes related to starch, sucrose, cysteine, and methionine metabolism and the plant MAPK signaling pathways were enriched (Fig.13A). Nine transcription factors (WRKY40, HDG5, WRKY70, ZAT10, DOF1, SCL14, BHLH162, JA2L, and ZAT11) were located in the second layer of the network, while PTI5 was positioned at the top layer, suggesting its significant function in the response to 6-BA. Similar expression trends were determined for two transcription factors, and both increased in parallel with the 6-BA concentration. Therefore, PTI5 may play a positive regulatory role in budding (Fig.13D).

In the TDZ groups, genes related to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and glutathione and cyanoamino acid metabolism pathways were enriched at the bottom of the network (Fig.13B). Eight transcription factors, including BHLH162, NAP2, and ERF1B, were located in the middle of the network, indicating their important regulatory roles. LBD1, a transcription factor crucial for shaping plant architecture, was positioned at the top of the network. LBD1 expression decreased as the duration of TDZ treatment increased, suggesting a negative regulatory effect of LBD1 on budding (Fig.13D).

In the leaf position groups, only the cyanoamino acid metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways were enriched (Fig.13C). BHLH130 was located in the middle layer of the network, and WER, a MYB transcription factor, was located in the top layer. WR expression was highest in L2, followed by L6, and lowest in L4, the most developmentally mature leaf of the tissue culture seedlings (Fig.13D). Low WER expression in L4 implied a positive correlation between WER expression and leaf tenderness.

Our results point to PTI5, LBD1, and WER as core genes in leaf regeneration and budding processes in Poplar 741.

This study established an efficient direct bud regeneration system using leaf explants derived from in vitro-cultured Poplar 741 seedlings. To determine the optimal leaf transformation window, we systematically tracked cell cycle progression at wound sites under varying pre-culture conditions. Through integrated physiological assays, endogenous hormone profiling, and high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we analyzed dynamic changes in hormone levels and annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during bud induction across treatment regimes. Further exploration of molecular mechanisms revealed key regulatory networks driving leaf regeneration, enabling identification of core treatment-responsive genes. This optimized regeneration system and its molecular characterization provide a critical foundation for genetic transformation of Poplar 741, while offering mechanistic insights to advance regeneration and transformation protocols in woody plants.

This investigation employed leaves from differentiated and rooted Poplar 741 seedlings as dual explant sources to assess regeneration capacity. Identical orthogonal array designs implemented across media treatments revealed divergent organogenic competencies: Differentiated seedling leaves demonstrated severely compromised regenerative potential. Hormonal treatments largely failed to induce bud formation, with sporadic adventitious buds exclusively localized near petioles (max induction: 41.33%). This limitation is mechanistically linked to structural fragility and rapid oxidative browning during differentiation.Rooted seedling leaves exhibited robust morphogenic responses. The optimal formulation (MS + 1.0 mg/L 6BA + 0.1 mg/L NAA) achieved 85% adventitious bud induction with dense green bud clusters.

The strategic selection of exogenous hormones constitutes a critical determinant of regeneration efficacy.While 6-BA and IBA demonstrate competence in direct adventitious bud induction,But some other combinations of exogenous hormones can further improve the regeneration efficiency [18], this study reveals that combinatorial regimens incorporating judicious concentrations of 6-BA, IAA, and TDZ significantly enhance organogenic outcomes. Crucially, species-specific responses to 6-BA necessitate tailored optimization [19,20], with TDZ emerging as a superior cytokinin due to its unique capacity to inhibit cytokinin oxidase and prolong bioactive cytokinin persistence [21]. Empirical evidence consistently indicates that TDZ deficiency yields negligible bud induction [22], whereas its calibrated application elevates rates substantially. However, concentration thresholds remain biologically constrained: prolonged exposure or excessive doses (> 1.0 mg/L) trigger vitrification (translucent, water-soaked tissues), aberrant morphogenesis [23,24], and petiole swelling that arrests organogenic initiation. To reconcile efficacy with safety, our protocol implemented pulsed TDZ preconditioning followed by decisive transfer to TDZ-free media for uncompromised bud development.

Inorganic salts stimulate plant cell growth, with species-specific optimal concentrations necessitating precise selection of culture media for plant organ cultivation. Among commonly used basal media (MS, WPM, LS) [25], MS medium yielded the highest regeneration efficiency due to its elevated inorganic salt/ion concentrations compared to WPM and LS, balanced nutrient composition, appropriate reagent ratios, and inherent stability meeting physiological and nutritional requirements [26,27]. Leaf positioning directly influences differentiation outcomes, as regeneration capacity in poplar varies with tissue ontogeny. Specifically, the second leaf from the apex of 20-day-old rooted seedlings achieved maximal differentiation rates in Poplar 741, attributable to accelerated growth kinetics and enhanced endogenous hormone secretion in juvenile versus basal leaves. Consequently, an optimized regeneration system was established using: the second leaf from 20-day-old rooted seedlings as explant, 6-day in vitro pretreatment with TDZ, and differentiation medium containing MS supplemented with 1.0 mg/L 6-BA, 0.05 mg/L IAA, and 0.01 mg/L TDZ.

Plant growth and development are regulated by key phytohormones, with ABA suppressing cell division and promoting senescence. In this study, ABA content exhibited a biphasic response to increasing 6-BA concentrations—initial decrease followed by increase. Specifically, 1.0 mg/L 6-BA (B2 treatment) inhibited ABA synthesis, thereby promoting leaf differentiation. Conversely, ZT content increased progressively with 6-BA concentration elevation, demonstrating that 6-BA-induced ZT synthesis enhances differentiation capacity.IAA displayed concentration-dependent effects: low levels stimulate cambial division while high levels inhibit growth. Under 6-BA gradients, IAA content peaked then declined, with B2 treatment enhancing IAA synthesis to induce bud differentiation.Prolonged TDZ pretreatment duration progressively decreased ABA while increasing ZT accumulation. which accelerated leaf differentiation beyond other treatments. The observed efficacy aligns with meristematic tissue hyperactivity during regeneration [28], where elevated endogenous IAA and ZT in juvenile tissues facilitate callus induction.As TDZ pretreatment duration increased, IAA content exhibited an initial increase followed by decrease, indicating that TDZ pretreatment promotes IAA synthesis and accelerates leaf differentiation. Multiple phytohormones including abscisic acid (ABA) interactively regulate callus differentiation [29]. In Poplar 741, ABA content progressively increased from apical to basal leaves, suggesting apical leaves more effectively inhibit ABA synthesis, thereby accelerating differentiation. Zeatin (ZT) content peaked in middle/apical leaves then declined basally, consistent with preferential ZT synthesis in younger tissues that facilitates adventitious bud induction. IAA content was highest in basal leaves, yet differentiation occurred faster in middle/upper leaves, indicating basal leaf senescence compromises regeneration.

Genetic transformation provides a powerful molecular biology tool. Using the established optimal direct bud induction medium (MS + 1.0 mg/L 6-BA + 0.05 mg/L IAA + 0.01 mg/L TDZ), Poplar 741 leaves were pre-cultured to define the transformation window. Pre-culture stimulated callus proliferation, expanding transformable cell populations. Cell cycle distribution analysis across differential pre-culture durations, validated by transient transformation with the PBI121 overexpression vector, identified 3-day pre-culture as optimal—eliciting peak cell cycle gene expression and maximal transformation efficiency. Consequently, 3-day pre-culture is recommended for Poplar 741 genetic transformation. Implementing this protocol with optimal explants (second apical leaf) and induction medium yielded 21.5% stable transformation efficiency, demonstrating the method's efficacy for direct bud induction and genetic modification.

Transcriptome sequencing of Poplar 741 leaves under differential treatments revealed through RNA sequencing that plant hormone signal transduction and zeatin (ZT) biosynthesis pathways constitute key regulatory networks during bud formation. During organogenesis, these pathways form intricate hormonal interaction networks, with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in plant hormone signaling—particularly those governing tryptophan metabolism along with ZT and carotenoid biosynthesis—directly modulating auxin, cytokinin, and ABA dynamics.

Tryptophan metabolism (Plant hormone signal transduction) involved significant downregulation of 6-BA responsive genes including early auxin response markers (AUX1, AUX/IAA, GH3, and SAUR) [30]. Under B1 treatment, these genes showed declining expression, likely reflecting 6-BA driven mesophyll differentiation that suppresses auxin synthesis. Conversely, B2 treatment upregulated early auxin response genes, indicating high 6-BA concentrations promote leaf senescence and impair differentiation. In TDZ groups, multiple growth response genes were downregulated while the growth response factor ARF [31] was upregulated, demonstrating distinct regulatory mechanisms between TDZ and 6-BA in mesophyll modulation, with TDZ dynamically maintaining hormonal homeostasis. Leaf positional treatments showed DEGs exclusively in L2 vs L6 comparisons, confirming reduced auxin in juvenile leaves enhances differentiation competence.

During zeatin biosynthesis (Plant hormone signal transduction), expression of A-ARR (a cytokinin signaling repressor) [32] was downregulated in 6-BA treatment groups, demonstrating 6-BA's capacity to promote ZT biosynthesis and initiate leaf differentiation. TDZ groups exhibited more complex regulation: in T6 vs T0, expression of cytokinin receptor CRE1 [33] and AHP was upregulated while A-ARR-related genes were downregulated; conversely, T10 vs T0 showed contrasting AHP and A-ARR expression patterns, indicating treatday-dependent signal transduction dynamics. Beyond modulating endogenous cytokinins, TDZ may stimulate growth through adenine/phenylurea cytokinin receptors, evidenced by minimal organogenesis without TDZ [34,35]. Cytokinin-regulated cell proliferation and bud regeneration increased proportionally with TDZ concentration.

Carotenoid biosynthesis (Plant hormone signal transduction) employs a dual negative regulatory system comprising PYR/PYL, PP2C, and SnRK2. Normally, PP2C inhibits SnRK2; ABA binding to PYR/PYL/RCAR forms complexes that inhibit PP2C, thereby activating SnRK2 [36]. This enables rapid ABA-responsive growth modulation. Under B2 treatment, decreased PYR/PYL expression, increased PP2C, and reduced SnRK2 collectively inhibited ABA synthesis. Conversely, B3 treatment reversed this pattern, indicating high 6-BA concentrations promote leaf senescence through ABA accumulation. In TDZ groups, SnRK2 downregulation in T6 vs T0 indicated optimal TDZ duration enhances differentiation, while ABF upregulation in T10 vs T0 aligned with prolonged TDZ's inhibitory effects.

In zeatin biosynthesis pathways, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enrichment was observed across 6-BA and TDZ treatments. IPT5 (a rate-limiting enzyme in cytokinin synthesis) [37] exhibited biphasic expression in 6-BA groups: initial downregulation followed by concentration-dependent upregulation, peaking in B2 treatment which achieved maximal differentiation efficiency. However, elevated 6-BA concentrations inhibit differentiation, as confirmed by endogenous hormone profiles. Contrasting regulatory patterns emerged in cytokinin degradation pathways, where CKX expression increased proportionally with 6-BA concentration [38]. Under B3 treatment, profound CKX upregulation accelerated cytokinin degradation, reducing differentiation efficiency—aligning with hormonal assays. Conversely, B2 treatment downregulated CKX, elevating cytokinin levels and enhancing mesophyll differentiation. TDZ groups showed consistent downregulation of CKX-related genes in T6 and T10 treatments, evidencing TDZ-mediated cytokinin activation. Notably, TDZ concurrently downregulated ZT biosynthesis genes and upregulated degradation genes, demonstrating exogenous cytokinin application suppresses endogenous synthesis. Both 6-BA supplementation and TDZ preconditioning in juvenile leaves likely achieve hormonal homeostasis by inhibiting IPT5 while promoting CKX expression [39–41]. These physiological and transcriptomic insights elucidate leaf regeneration mechanisms, though complex interactions between exogenous hormones and explant selection necessitate further investigation.

Based on differentially expressed genes selected from multiple pathways under three treatments, the Gaussian Graphical Model algorithm identified core regulatory genes. In 6-BA treatment groups, expression levels of PTI5 increased progressively with 6-BA concentration elevation, indicating these transcription factors positively regulate bud induction in Poplar 741 leaves. PTI5 belongs to the Ethylene Response Factor family, playing pivotal roles in ethylene signaling and plant hormone crosstalk within complex regulatory networks [42]. Tissue culture-induced leaf wounding likely activated PTI5 expression, paralleling its wound-responsive immune regulation in solanaceous crops through hormone pathways [43]. As 6-BA initiates differentiation, PTI5 may function as a crucial positive regulator in Poplar 741 tissue culture systems. Previous research on PTI5 primarily focused on stress resistance in crops like tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum), leaving its tissue culture functions underexplored—thus warranting further investigation in Poplar 741.

In TDZ treatment groups, LBD1 merged as the key transcription factor. Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain genes critically shape plant architecture by governing stem, leaf, and root formation during early development and regeneration [44]. For instance, Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs (AtLBD16, AtLBD17, AtLBD18, AtLBD29) drive callus initiation, highlighting LBD1's potential role in Poplar 741 organogenesis under TDZ exposure.Conversely, suppression of LBD gene expression inhibits callus formation [45]. LBD genes are responsive to plant hormone signal transduction pathways [46], exhibiting species-specific regulatory patterns: in Arabidopsis thaliana, LBD40 is downregulated by gibberellin [47] while LBD20 responds to jasmonic acid [48]; in Camellia species, distinct LBD members show differential responses to gibberellic acid, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, and ethephon treatments [49]. In this study, LBD1 mediated bud induction in Poplar 741 leaves through TDZ-responsive signaling within mesophyll cells. Critically, prolonged TDZ exposure progressively decreased LBD1 expression levels, demonstrating its dual regulatory function as a positive regulator of bud formation and negative regulator of callogenesis in Poplar 741.

In leaf position treatments, WER (a MYB-family transcription factor) was identified as a core regulatory gene. As callus formation during hormone-induced regeneration shares developmental parallels with lateral root initiation, WER may mediate hormone-responsive leaf regeneration. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate WER regulates root epidermal cell differentiation [50], while in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) GhWER activates ethylene signaling genes and modulates auxin/gibberellin pathways [51]. Although prior research focused on WER’s roles in crop stress tolerance, its functions in woody plants remain largely unexplored. Further investigation of these core genes under genetic transformation will elucidate molecular mechanisms governing regeneration in Poplar 741.

In this study, the optimal differentiation medium forPoplar 741leaves was shown to comprise MS + 1.0 mg/L 6-BA + 0.05 mg/L IAA + 0.01 mg/L TDZ, which resulted in an adventitious bud induction rate of adventitious buds of up to 85%; The optimal preprocessing time for TDZ was 6 days, and the most favorable explant site forPoplar 741leaf differentiation was the second leaf. With this efficientPoplar 741leaf regeneration system, the optimal time window for genetic transformation was 3 days of pre-culture; under this condition, the transformation efficiency reached 68%. Transcriptome and interaction network analyses showed that most of the DEGs were enriched in pathways related to plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, suggesting their ability to influencePoplar 741leaf differentiation. The core genes identified in the 6-BA, TDZ, and leaf position treatments werePTI5,LBD1, andWER, respectively. These transcription factors may play key roles in inducing adventitious buds.
