In this work, we report the results of a theoretical–computational
analysis of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth and degradation
dynamics occurring in lithium metal batteries during cycling. We use
ab initio-kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to generate a synthetic
data set, which is analyzed by machine learning methods. We aim to
determine: (i) how modifications in interfacial interaction energies
between solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) blocks and between Li ions
and SEI facets impact the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the battery
and (ii) what factors, including reactions, microscopic transport,
and other interfacial events, may lead to cell performance “failure”
during prolonged charge and discharge cycles, signaled as a sharp
decay in the CE over cycling. The demonstration of our approach is
done on a cell including a Li metal surface interfacing with a previously
introduced state-of-the-art electrolyte, and the idea can be applied
to any electrochemical system. Outcomes include the identification
of the leading chemical, physical, and structural variables causing
cell failure and relating them to the electrolyte formulation, thus
paving the way to future more refined analysis and electrolyte design.

Li metal anodes are among the most promising
negative electrodes
for rechargeable batteries, which is due to lithium having the lowest
electrochemical potential (−3.04 V vs standard hydrogen electrode)
and an extraordinarily high specific capacity (3860 mA h/g). However, mainly because of Li very high reactivity,
practical implementations of Li metal batteries encounter numerous
challenges, including dendrite formation,
solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films with undesired chemical and
physical properties, and cross-talk events with various cathode materials,
all these leading to short battery lifetimes, cumulative degradation
events, and catastrophic failure translated in a sudden drop in the
specific battery capacity during cycling. Various strategies to mitigate these issues include electrolyte
design, artificial SEIs, anode alloying, or combining with other materials
to enhance chemical, electrochemical, and/or mechanical stability.

A crucial topic that may help elucidate
battery degradation behavior
is related to the interfacial phenomena taking place at the anode/electrolyte
interface, including SEI formation, growth, and evolution, along with
simultaneous Li plating, stripping, as well as ionic and molecular
diffusion. Advances in current surface
and interfacial experimental characterization methods allow elucidating
both SEI formation and Li evolution morphologies during cycling.,First-principles, atomistic-based modeling at various time/length
scales has shown to provide additional insights that enhance fundamental
understanding and can offer fresh design principles targeting not
only high but also sustained battery capacity.

Thus, we combined AI-kMC and ML methodologies to analyze and
extract
new information related to battery degradation and the factors that
may cause battery failure. We report a detailed analysis of results
from a theoretical–computational study of SEI growth and degradation
dynamics occurring in lithium metal batteries during cycling. We use
AI-kMC simulations to generate a synthetic
data set for a Li metal/electrolyte system that we studied in detail
in previous work. The data set is used
in part for training and in part for testing of machine learning (ML)
models for predicting factors affecting the Coulombic efficiency (CE),
taken as a measurement of the battery decay. We analyze how changes
in interfacial interaction energies between Li ions and SEI blocks
and between SEI blocks impact the battery CE over cycling and elucidate
the main chemical and environmental factors leading to cell performance
“failure,” signaled as a sharp decay in the CE over
prolonged cycling. By detecting specific interfacial microscopic events
(reactions, diffusion) and identity of SEI chemical species and their
mobility properties most likely to induce cell failure, we relate
this knowledge not only to the electrolyte formulation but also to
the cell level, thus facilitating future more refined electrolyte
design and battery operation features.

The methodology in this research
uses data generated by AI-kMC
simulations,,emulating the electrochemical
reactions and diffusion events occurring in a simulated electrochemical
cell cycling between charge and discharge. The potential energy surfaces
and activation barriers used in the AI-kMC model were obtained from
first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The electrochemical performance
in the simulated electrochemical system is defined by the calculated
CE at each discharge–charge cycle obtained from AI-kMC simulations.
Based on the generated data, ML algorithms are employed to characterize
factors that affect the CE, using ML techniques such as SHAP explanatory
analysis and Bayesian optimization. The electrochemical system investigated,consists of a Li metal anode slab in contact with an electrolyte
solution of composition 1.2 M lithium bis­(fluorosulfonyl) imide salt
(LiFSI) dissolved in a 6.5 M fluorinated ether solvent: 1-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)
ethane (F5DEE). The DFT calculated electrolyte decomposition mechanisms
are depicted inFigure.,Initially, we used our AI-kMC algorithm, which models
a series of chemical and electrochemical microscopic events occurring
at the anode side during battery cycling, including electrolyte decomposition
reduction reactions, adsorption and diffusion of all involved species
governing the initial growth and aggregation of SEI blocks of individual
chemical organic and inorganic species, and the plating and stripping
reactions of Li ions arriving and leaving the metal anode surface,
respectively, at each cycle. The cathode is not explicitly modeled;
however, the electrolyte is cycled between the anode and the cathode
during each charge–discharge cycle.

for the most relevant pairs in the system of study. Note that interfacial
ionic mobilities are calculated from the DFT pair-bonding energies
calculated at a given interface. We conducted
380 AI-kMC simulations. In each simulation, we varied 19 pair-bonding
interaction energies (listed inTable) within the range of 0 to 1.5 eV, using fixed increments
of 0.1 eV. In the first set, each interaction was modified individually
(one at a time), while in the random simulation set, multiple interaction
energies were changed simultaneously in a random manner, still maintaining
the 0.1 eV increment step for each. The rationale behind this design
is 2-fold: the fixed 0.1 eV increments allow us to isolate
and observe the effect of each interaction in a controlled manner,
while the randomized multivariable simulations better reflect the
complex and correlated variations likely to occur in realistic systems,
where several bonding environments evolve simultaneously.

Each AI-kMC simulation was run for 100 cycles of charge
and discharge
(switching the voltage between 4.4 and 2.8 V, respectively) with the
given electrolyte formulation, at a constant temperature of 298 K.,The structural framework is formed by a tetragonal simulation cell,

boundary conditions are applied in all three directions. Usinga0= 4.47 Å allows the crystal to accommodate
either FCC or BCC like motifs, reproducing the range of Li+coordination environments that occur at the Li/SEI interfaces.

efficiency.

Bayesian optimization (BO) was employed
to identify optimal configurations of the most important pair-bonding
interactions identified previously by SHAP. BO was implemented in
Optuna using its Tree-Structured Parzen
Estimator (TPE) sampler, which builds a nonparametric surrogate model
of the objective function at each iteration. Gaussian Process (GP)
has been successfully tested for nonparametric and flexible models
in lithium battery systems. The study
was scheduled for 150 trials but converged in approximately 40 evaluations,
making it computationally efficient. These optimal values were compared
with the theoretical ones from the DFT predictions shown inTable.

Furthermore, a deep analysis regarding the battery
“failure”
was made using the same synthetic data set. This part of the analysis
was divided into 2 parts. The first one consisted of the study of
the same reaction, mobility, and morphology evolution features at
intervals of specific CE. At each interval, every parameter was compared
using classical statistical measures (standard deviation, average,
variance, etc.) to observe possible changes that may cause a decrease
in the CE. The results were embodied in heatmaps to facilitate the
interpretation. In the second part of the analysis, we divided the
simulation results into failure and nonfailure regions, and, similar
to the first part, we compared both regions to detect possible changes
that may cause drops in the CE. Moreover, since not all combinations
of every pair-bonding interaction lead to battery failure before 100
cycles, we trained several binary classifiers, including Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, and XGBoost. We evaluated the model’s performance using metrics
such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves and
AUC values, in order to select the best
model. These methods have been successfully applied in similar battery
degradation studies, for instance, Wang et al. used multiple classifier methods to accurately predict
the battery end-of-life for commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite
cells. Once the optimal classifier was identified, we employed the
SHAP method to find which pair-bonding interaction contributes to
premature failure.

Both analyses provide new insights regarding
the evolution and
degradation of the SEI in lithium metal batteries, offering an example
of the development of robust predictive tools to guide the design
and optimization of future advanced battery-based energy storage technologies.

FigureandTableshow that the best-performing models according to
the metrics RMSE, MSE, andR2are, in
descending order, 4 layers DenseNN (512, 256, 128, and 1 neurons),
MLPRregressor, XGBoost, and Extra Trees. The correlation coefficient
of DenseNN is close to 1, which means an excellent fit with the data
set. Furthermore, the parity plots inFigureconfirm a good fit and nonoverfitting, since
the points are homogeneously distributed along the 1:1 line, with
accumulation near 100% CE.

Predicted vs observed CE according to four models:
(a) Dense Neural
Network, (b) MLPRegressor, (c) XGBoost, and (d) Extra Trees achieve
nearly perfect training fits; the Dense Neural Network exhibits the
smallest prediction errors and tightest test-set clustering, followed
closely by the MLPRegressor; XGBoost performs well with a slightly
higher variance at high CE.

Figureshows that
while all four modelsDense Neural Network, MLPRegressor, XGBoost,
and Extra Treesachieve nearly perfect training fits, the Dense
Neural Network exhibits the smallest prediction errors and tightest
test-set clustering, followed closely by the MLPRegressor; XGBoost
performs well with a slightly higher variance at high CE.

Figureshows a beeswarm plot of the SHAP values for the most important
interfacial features in the system of study obtained from the DenseNN
model. The horizontal SHAP value is expressed in percentage points
of CE, where 0 means the average value of CE. Each dot is one simulation,
colored red when the feature value is high and blue when it is low.
Thus, a red (blue) cluster far to the right signals that larger (lower)
values of that variable consistently improve CE, whereas a red (blue)
cluster to the left shows that higher (lower) levels harm it. A dense
cluster occurs when many simulations share the same feature value,
so their dots overlap; a feature can therefore look as if it has only
a few points even though it is present in every record. If a feature’s
dots are close to 0 value, it means that the feature has a negligible
effect on the objective variable prediction (CE). The horizontal SHAP
axis uses the same units as the objective variable (percentage points
of CE), so each SHAP value represents how much that feature shifts
the predicted CE for a given simulation. Dense clusters of points
arise when a feature takes nearly identical values across many simulations,
which means that their SHAP contributions are almost the same and
thus overlap visually, whereas a spread of points indicates that the
feature varies widely and produces a broader range of impacts. Sometimes,
a feature appears to have very few points, not because it is missing
data, but because it only yields a small set of unique values, causing
many overlapping points to merge into what looks like a single marker.
Features are ranked in descending importance order from top to bottom.

SHAP analysis
from the Dense Neural Network model. (a) Chemical
process features where Li stripping, solv_IDP3, and salt_IDP1 are
the strongest positive drivers of CE, while salt_IDP2 and N3–/S2–formation negatively impact it. (b) Mobility
parameters for FSI–, F5DEE, and SFO correlate positively
with CE, whereas excessive Li0or S2–mobilities are detrimental. (c) Most critical pair-bonding interactions,
indicating that optimum Li-X interaction values are small.

Figurea shows
that Li stripping is the most important parameter, which is chemically
consistent, since stripping is the main contribution to the discharge
reaction, the termQdis(eq). According to our simulations,
the amount of the F5DEE solvent decomposition product (solv_IDP2)
is too small; thus, it can be disregarded (as shown inTable), consistent with the NMR operando
results of May et al., which reveal that
late-stage fragmentation of fluorinated ether is kinetically limited
under practical current densities.Figurea also reveals a clear positive impact to
the CE from the solvent decomposition intermediate product vinyl fluoride
(solv_IDP3), but a clear negative impact (but less important due to
its hierarchy in the vertical order of SHAP values) for the early
solvent decomposition product 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-[2-(2-fluoroethoxy)
ethoxy] ethane (solv_IDP1), suggesting that the presence of high concentrations
of solv_IDP3 tends to improve the battery performance. This means
that the CE would be favored if the solvent is further decomposed
beyond solv_IDP1 and remains as solv_IDP3 without further defluorination.

Mean, standard deviation, minimum,
maximum, and 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Mobility is quantified
as the number of molecules undergoing positional changes per charge/discharge
cycle, whereas the other parameters denote the number of reactions
or events occurring within each cycle. Variables are defined inFigureandTable.

This takes us to the next point, which is the presence
of LiF,
a well-known and, in many cases, desired SEI component. Interestingly,
the results inFigurea indicate that the F–generation, which would
result in fluorinated compounds starting with LiF, yields an impact
on the CE that changes from positive to negative as the concentration
of LiF increases. At short times, LiF comes from salt defluorination;
however, at longer times, the amount of LiF may increase considerably
for this electrolyte due to F5DEE decomposition (reactions b1, b3,
b4,Figure). Therefore,
the SHAP analysis implies that deep F5DEE fragmentation decreases
CE. This could be explained because excessive LiF concentrations may
increase the ionic resistance, limiting the Li+transport,
augmenting the interface polarization, and promoting lithium dendrite
growth.,On the other hand, Jia et al. suggested that moderate levels of LiF in SEI
improve ionic conductivity and electronic insulation. Furthermore,
our results also agree with those of reports of other fluorinated
ether solvents. For instance, Zhang et al. indicated that partial cleavage to fluoro-alkoxy species passivates
Li, improving cycling stability and boosting CE and oxidation stability.
Lee et al. indicated that LiF-rich SEI
contributes to improved electrochemical performance and reversibility
of lithium metal anodes. Additionally, vinyl fluoride (solv_IDP3)
could in situ polymerize into poly­(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF),
forming a matrix that ensures an even distribution of lithium, which
leads to stable Li+flux.

Exploring the LiFSI decomposition products via SHAP analysis (Figurea), we find that
the first salt defluorination yielding bis­(fluorosulfonyl)­imide anion
(salt_IDP1) shows a positive impact in the low-to-moderate concentration
range, which implies that moderate FSI–and LiF
coverage fosters a more stable SEI and suppresses the formation of
lithium dendrites.,By contrast, the presence of
the decomposition product fluorosulfonylimide dianion (salt_IDP2)
exerts a negative impact on CE. In fact, the negative impact on CE
due to the presence of large quantities of salt_IDP2 corresponds to
the second most important feature in the model. Thus, according to
the mechanism inFigure, the product salt_IDP2 should continue reduction, forming further
LiF from the second salt defluorination.

All of the previous
electrochemical reactions required the presence
of e–from the anode to be formed, which byQchdefinition reduces CE. Besides F–, the further reduction of salt_IDP2 gives products such as S2–, O2–, N3–, which
could easily trap incoming Li ions. Note that the SHAP analysis points
to S2–, O2–negatively influencing
the CE. This can be understood based on previous work showing that Li2O reduces the Li+transport due to high interfacial interaction energy (>2.5 eV),
which can negatively affect the cell performance. Moreover, according
to Jaberi et al., the relatively low
Li+conductivity in Li2O can potentially hinder
Li transport during the SEI formation. Also, despite Li2S is known for enabling fast Li+transport because of
its high conductivity, some studies suggest that crystal orientation influences
the Li deposition behaviors. Thus, unfavorable Li2S crystal
facets during SEI aggregation may negatively impact the CE. Li et
al. showed that Li3N exhibits
high ionic conductivity and thermodynamic stability against lithium
metal; its relatively high electronic conductivity (2.6 × 10–7S·cm–1for α-Li3N) exceeds the desirable threshold
for dendrite suppression. In addition, the low concentration of Li
and N vacancies results in limited ionic conductivity and poor resistance
to dendrite formation under elevated current densities, ultimately
leading to restricted cycling life and diminished capacities.

The results also show that the adsorption
of F5DEE over Li2O and further decomposition positively
impact the CE. This
behavior could be explained due to the formation of LiOH adsorbed
over Li2O (Figure), which, according to previous reports, could further react
with Li0to form LiH, increasing the SEI stability. In addition, F5DEE decomposition yields LiF
over the Li2O surface. The beneficial effect of LiF therefore
appears to depend on its provenance, which could explain the positive
impact of F–observed in SHAP graphs, as discussed
above. Tan et al., employing Bader charge
analysis, found that the interfacial F5DEE-Li2O reaction
does not require external flow charge. Furthermore, when analyzing
the full range of cycles, F5DEE appears more likely to decompose via
the surface adsorption pathway. This is supported by the data inTable, where the number
of F5DEE decomposition events closely matches the number of LiF formation
events, and byFigures S1 and S2, which
show that LiF production peaks during the final cycles coincide with
a higher frequency of F5DEE adsorption events.

Regarding ion mobility,
it is widely known that fast Li+transport is necessary
for optimal battery performance. However,
the mobility mechanisms of other species
within the SEI have not been thoroughly investigated. Our findings,
shown inFigureb,
reveal that once compounds like Li2S, Li2O,
and Li3N form and integrate into the SEI, their mobility
is relatively low (seeTable); however, their enhanced mobility could increase the CE,
possibly because their redistribution helps form a more uniform SEI.
In contrast, LiF exhibits larger mobility during SEI formation, which
may allow it to reorganize dynamically within the interphase. This
behavior could influence both the mechanical properties and ion conduction
pathways of the SEI, indicating a need to increase LiF, Li2S, Li2O, and Li3N mobilities to maintain a
more homogeneous interphase. This could be attributed to the fact
that composition, thickness, and structure of the SEI are not static
after the initial formation, i.e., during
the SEI aggregation stage. Furthermore,Figureb shows that the mobility of FSI–anions and solvent molecules (such as F5DEE and its decomposition
products) is relevant. The high mobility of these species ensures
efficient ion transport and uniform SEI formation and favors the increase
of both plating and stripping, which are vital for achieving high
CE.,However, our SHAP and Bayesian optimization
(BO) results also indicate that low mobility of the salt decomposition
products (e.g., salt_IDP1 to salt_IDP7) is desirable. When these products
migrate excessively, they may disrupt ion pathways or destabilize
the SEI. Instead, they should stay in place and react to form the
inorganic salt products. Therefore, our findings suggest the following
strategy: promote the localized reactivity of salt-derived intermediate
species and allow sufficient mobility among key inorganic SEI components
(such as LiF, Li2O, and Li2S) so they can reorganize
within the interphase and evolve toward more stable and cohesive structures.

These mobility characteristics are intrinsically linked to the
interactions between Li ions and other chemical species. Our analysis
indicates that interactions involving lithium have the most significant
impact on CE (Figurec), whereas interactions among other species have a minimal effect.
Specifically, weaker interactions between Li and other components
facilitate higher Li+mobility at the respective interfaces,
enhancing Li ion transport and overall battery performance, as validated
by first-principles computational studies and results of high ionic conductivity with weak–weak dipole
interaction in polymer ionic electrolyte reported by Chen et al.

To further characterize these pair-bonding interactions and their
effect on the CE, we used Bayesian optimization methods shown inFigure. The use of Bayesian
optimization aligns with the methodology used in battery research.
For instance, Noh et al. and Suzumura
et al. employed BO combined with data-driven
methodologies to obtain multiple solvents for a redox-active molecule,
2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, and to achieve the best composition with maximum
lithium ion conductivity in a mixture of four LiTFSI solutions, respectively.
This validates our multidimensional, data-driven approach as an efficient
method to translate complex models into useful experimental guidance.

Bayesian
optimization analysis for the Dense Neural Network model
shows: (a) 2D dimensional plots showing the predicted Coulombic efficiency
(CE) as a function of pair interaction energy (in eV) for a few relevant
interactions of Li ions with SEI components; (b) 3D plot illustrating
the combined effect of SFO–Li and F–Li interactions
on the predicted CE.

Bayesian optimization was used to identify the
pair-bonding interaction
energy strength (measured in eV) that maximizes CE for Li-SEI component
interactions, which were detected as the most relevant. The optimization
suggests that nearly all bond energies, except those of Li ions linked
to salt decomposition products (SFO), should be as low as possible
to increase the CE. This aligns with our SHAP analyses, where strong
lithium-SEI component interactions reduce battery performance. These
optimal pair interaction values can offer useful insights into the
design of electrolytes that improve interfacial chemistry. The insights
can be summarized into aiming for minimal bonding energies of solvent-derived
species and their decomposition products with lithium, while tolerating
higher affinities toward salt-derived fragments, to improve battery
performance and enhance SEI uniformity. Note that the red vertical
line inFigurea corresponds
to the DFT calculated pair-bonding energy for the respective species.
For most inorganic SEI species, the maximum CE agrees with the DFT
value. However, during the SEI aggregation process, such a value may
vary because the interacting crystallographic facet might not offer
the optimum value, and/or because the inorganic species is aggregated
with others having different crystallographic characteristics that
may change the bonding type.

InFigureb, the SFO–Li (anion decomposition
productsLi) interaction
stood out as the most impactful among all pair energies. Since its
optimal value is not near zero, this interaction may be strategically
increased, suggesting a targeted avenue for further study. Furthermore,
the results indicate that the CE is much less sensitive to specific
Li–F interaction values, which makes the LiF features (crystallographic
state and type of exposed facet) much more flexible regarding their
impact on battery performance. This flexibility may be one of the
good properties of LiF as a key SEI component.

In
the previous sections, we investigated the effects of the various
SEI components and their interfacial interactions on the CE, targeting
a maximized CE. Another important feature that we aim to obtain from
this ML approach is the identification of the factors that eventually
cause battery failure, which is characterized by a sudden drop in
the CE versus cycle number. Thus, to predict battery failure, we employed
two complementary methods. First, we grouped the synthetic data set
by intervals of 10% of CE (between 10 and 20%, etc., up to 100% CE)
and visualized the normalized feature trends using a heatmap shown
inFigure(absolute
values are provided in Supporting Information,Figure S3).

Heatmap of the mean normalized values of each feature,
at each
of the equal-size CE intervals. Dark red means high normalized values
of the given feature, and dark blue means low values. Thus, the heatmap
tracks how each feature increases or decreases as CE drops.

This evaluation revealed clear patterns. From the
intervals with
low CE values (∼<30–40%), it is found that low values
(blue boxes) of reactions lead to formation of F–as given by salt and solvent defluorination: salt_IDP1, solv_IDP1,
and formation of vinyl species solv_IDP3, F5DEE adsorption, and low
mobilities of FSI–and SOL fragments, as well as
low plating reactions over SEI and surface, and low Li stripping reactions
correlate with decrease of CE. On the other hand, red boxes in the
same CE intervals show that the CE fall is strongly correlated with
the rise of N3–, O2–, and S2–species and accumulation of salt_IDP2 (thus impeding
second salt defluorination,Figure). Other parameters of the same Low CE intervals showed
no consistent trend. Likewise, the values for most of the parameters
in the high-efficiency band between 70 to 100% present a non-clear
pattern, which could indicate that in this region the battery is stable,
so below 70% suggests the onset of battery degradation, which aligns
with literature criteria.,We employed this condition
for identifying the main features according to the second approach.
The findings are consistent with our earlier SHAP analysis and, combined
with the absolute values of the event quantities, could provide approximate
magnitudes and specific chemical features signaling the beginning
of the battery failure.

In the second method, we categorized
all simulations in the data
set into two groups: failure and nonfailure based on whether Coulombic
efficiency dropped below the threshold defined earlier (70%). We then
compared the mean normalized values of all features across both groups
using a heatmap, as shown inFigure(the absolute values are presented inFigure S4). This analysis helps us to summarize
the results shown inFigure. The most important change associated with failure is the
sharp decrease (almost 90%) in the mobility of species FSI–and SOL, which reflects the importance of the SEI dynamics in the
lithium battery performance. This suggests that loss of mobility of
key SEI species may disrupt SEI reassignment during cycling, thus
impeding Li ion accessibility at the interface for plating, contributing
directly to CE degradation. Therefore, a significant drop is observed
in the formation of solv_IDP1 and salt_IDP1, as well as in lithium
plating on the metallic surface, which are features previously linked
to efficient and reversible lithium cycling. Their reduction may indicate
the beginning of interfacial instability or depletion of reactive
species that could contribute to a stable and dynamic SEI.

the mean normalized values for each parameter of the
data set, comparing failure and nonfailure regions.

On the other hand, a strong increase of around
56–58% in
the generation of N3–, S2–, O2–, and salt_IDP2 components is observed in the failure
region, which mainly corresponds to the deep decomposition of LiFSI.
Their accumulation is consistent with irreversible SEI thickening,
side reactions, and loss of active lithium, all of which contribute
to performance decay. Interestingly, solv_IDP3 (vinyl radical species),
previously linked to high CE in the SHAP analysis, only decreases
moderately in the failure zone, suggesting that its presence may delay
degradation but is not sufficient to fully prevent it. Most other
features also show lower average values in the failure region, reinforcing
the idea that both chemical activity and ion mobility decline significantly
once CE falls. Altogether, this binary comparison supports the trends
observed in the SHAP and interval-based analyses and further emphasizes
that early warning indicators of battery failure are marked by suppressed
mobility of certain SEI components, reduced number of beneficial reaction
events, and an increase in irreversible side product formation.

In terms of battery lifetime, almost 50% of the simulations in
our data set reached failure in the range of 75–83 cycles,
with a median at 78 cycles (Figurea). Based on our previous findings, Li-X pair-bonding
interactions have the most strong influence on the CE. These pair
interactions were used to train a variety of binary classifiers presented
in theComputational Methodssection (Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost)
using a train–test split distribution of 60% and 40%, respectively.
Employing the ROC-AUC criterion, the
Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest value of 0.864, followed
by XGBoost and CatBoost (the rest of the models are presented in the
ROC curves inFigure S5). Nevertheless,
considering all metrics, XGBoost emerged as the best model, due to
its AUC values of 0.835 (second highest),
while presenting the highest precision and recall scores (Table). The confusion
matrix (Figure S7) shows that the model can successfully predict 76% of the failure
and 84% of nonfailure battery performances, which indicates a reliable
enough performance to be used in the SHAP analysis.

(a) Boxplot illustrates
the predicted cycle number at which lithium
battery failure is expected. (b) SHAP analysis of the XGBoost classifier
for the binary classification of battery failure, where positive (red)
SHAP values indicate features contributing to failure before 100 cycles.

The SHAP results (Figureb) revealed that high pair-bonding interaction
values of N–Li,
F–Li, F5DEE-Li, and O–Li, along with low values of Li–Li,
and moderate values of SFO-Li, correlated with premature failure.
While SFO–Li interaction was the most important (consistent
with previous results), the difference in mean absolute SHAP value
across all Li-centered bonds was relatively small (0.44–0.19;Figure S6), suggesting that multiple Li-related
interactions collectively contribute to failure rather than a single
dominant bond. These results are related to the previous findings
because high interactions of Li with the other chemical species generally
correlate with lower CE. However, we did observe the exception that
moderate SFO–Li interactions appear beneficial for stability.
This suggests that despite SFO–Li’s negative impact
on Li+transport, it may help create a more cohesive and
mechanically stable interphase. So, the balance of both effects must
be studied in more detail.

The integrated ab initio-kinetic Monte
Carlo/machine learning workflow
developed in this research demonstrates that data-driven surrogates
can reproduce the CE landscape of Li metal cells and provide useful
guidelines in electrolyte system design. The four-layer dense neural
network delivered the highest predictive accuracy (RMSE ≈ 1.93%,R2≈ 0.99), and SHAP analysis revealed
that Li stripping, high decomposition of vinyl fluoride formation
(solv_IDP3), and moderate LiF generation specially produced by adsorbent
F5DEE fragmentation enhance the CE (moderate LiF contents stabilize
the SEI and support Li+transport, but excessive LiF elevates
interfacial resistance, produce LiOH, and might encourage dendritic
growth), whereas gathering of solv_IDP1, production of Li Buried,
excessive production of dianionic salt fragment (salt_IDP2) together
with accumulation of S2–, O2–,
and N3–species are correlated with CE reduction
by thickening the SEI and reducing the transport of Li+. Furthermore, the results indicate that favoring further conversion
of solv_IDP1 to solv_IDP3 without complete defluorination is advantageous.
The mobility results indicate that dynamic reorganization of key inorganic
SEI components (LiF, Li2O, Li2S, and Li3N) is essential, while the salt-derived fragments (SFO) should
remain locally fixed to react in situ. Bayesian optimization (BO)
analysis further showed that with the only exception of SFO–Li
bonding, strong lithium pair interaction energies negatively impact
battery performance, reducing CE, implying that electrolyte formulations
should suppress excessive Li affinity toward fluorinated and oxygenated
SEI chemical species, while selectively enhancing affinity for SFO-derived
fragments.

Failure analysis through heatmaps reveals that once
CE falls below
70%, mobility of key electrolyte and SEI species (FSI–and solvent) drops, deep LiFSI reduction products surge, and uniform
lithium plating ceases. Furthermore, it reveals that ∼50% of
simulated cells cross the failure occurs between 75 and 83 cycles
(median 78). The XGBoost classifier, validated by ROC-AUC = 0.835,
predicts this transition reliably and attributes early failure to
elevated N–Li, F–Li, F5DEE–Li, and O–Li
interactions, moderate SFO–Li affinity, and low Li–Li
interaction energies. These results align with previous results where
the rise of N3–, S2–, O2–, and salt_IDP2 and with shortened mobility of FSI–and solvent fragments, leading to reduction of Li+transport
across the interphase, loss of active lithium, and rapid CE decay.

Driving solvent decomposition toward vinyl fluoride-type
species while limiting early intermediates.

Weaken most interfacial interactions except those linking
Li to the salt decomposition products (SFO–Li), which should
be tuned to an intermediate strength.

Monitor the interaction and mobility metrics as early
predictors of efficiency loss.

Sufficient
mobility among key inorganic SEI components
(e.g., LiF, Li2O, and Li2S) so they can reorganize
within the interphase and evolve toward more stable and cohesive structures.

Promote localized reactivity (low mobility,
stronger
interactions with Li ions) of salt-derived intermediate species.

Among factors causing the sudden drop of CE, the most
important
are associated with a sharp decrease in the mobility of anion and
intermediates from solvent decomposition, which reflects the importance
of the SEI dynamics. In addition, a reduced number of beneficial reaction
events and SEI thickening contribute to impeding healthy plating and
stripping on the surface.

Regarding connections of the conclusions
of this work to experimental
observables, here we outline preliminary ideas that may involve both
theory and experiments. Detailed experimental analysis of the SEI
composition and evolution during cycling is urgently needed. This
may comprise NMR, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), operando
microscopy, and other spectroscopic data capable of tracking SEI morphology
and chemical features during cycling as well as interfacial transport.
Aspects that need further understanding include ionic and electronic
conductivities in basic SEI blocks as functions of their degree of
crystallinity. The role of the SEI organic blocks and decomposition
fragments in electron and ion transfer needs further exploration.
Regarding the mobility of the SEI blocks during aggregation processes,
developing techniques such as computed tomography for tracking SEI
morphology should be at least an initial step.

Finally, we note
that the basic AI-kMC/ML scheme presented here
can be significantly enhanced. First, cathode degradation would modify
the quality and composition of the ionic currents flowing to the anode
side during cycling, known as cross-talk effects. Addressing the cathode
side and its own interfacial and bulk degradation chemistry and physics
starts at the AI/kMC level, followed by the combined AI-kMC/ML analysis.
This requires first a modification of the AI-kMC model incorporating
the cathode interfacial reactions and the model of the full cell.
Then, a similar approach, as presented here, can be extended to include
the cathode side, thus including additional factors that may influence
the life of the complete cell. Another aspect derived from the work
presented here is the extension of this work to other electrolyte
chemistries. This can be done by following the workflow discussed
in the AI-kMC work, which involves characterization
of the ab initio thermodynamics and kinetics parameters of the new
electrolyte chemistry prior to running the kMC algorithm, followed
by the ML implementation shown in this study.
