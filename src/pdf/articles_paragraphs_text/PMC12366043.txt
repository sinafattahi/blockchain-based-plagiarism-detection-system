Given improved survival, HIV + patients are now more likely to pursue common elective procedures, such as refractive surgery. We sought to assess the safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability of lamellar keratomileusis in patients with HIV.

A study was conducted with 14 patients (28 eyes) HIV-positive patients at Ineye Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, who underwent lamellar keratomileusis. They were observed for at least one year. 8 patients (16 eyes) had femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) and 6 patients (12 eyes) received small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Measurements taken before and after surgery included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refraction, spherical equivalent (SE), intraocular pressure, and any complications.

At one year postoperatively, all groups showed significant UDVA improvement (P< 0.001): overall from 1.36 ± 0.18 LogMAR to -0.07 ± 0.07 LogMAR, SMILE from 1.37 ± 0.18 LogMAR to -0.09 ± 0.07 LogMAR, and FS-LASIK from 1.35 ± 0.19 LogMAR to -0.11 ± 0.06 LogMAR, with all patients achieving a UDVA of 20/20 or better. Only 2 eyes (7.14%, both SMILE cases) experienced a 1-line decrease in CDVA. The mean SE improved from − 6.42 ± 1.46 D preoperatively to -0.06 ± 0.04D; with procedure-specific improvements observed: SMILE eyes improved from − 6.00 ± 0.92 D to -0.01 ± 0.26 D, while FS-LASIK eyes improved from − 6.74 ± 1.72 D to -0.09 ± 0.49 D, postoperatively (allP< 0.001). Refractive predictability outcomes revealed 89.29% of eyes within ± 0.50 D (SMILE 100% vs. FS-LASIK 87.50%), 96.43% within ± 1.00 D (SMILE 100% vs. FS-LASIK 93.75%), and 96.00% with astigmatism ≤ 0.50 D (SMILE 100% vs. FS-LASIK 93.75%). During the follow-up, dry eye syndrome occurred in 4 of 14 patients (28.57%, 2 SMILE and 2 FS-LASIK cases), but there were no serious complications, and no healthcare staff contracted HIV.

Laser lamellar corneal refractive surgery in HIV-positive patients demonstrated promising clinical outcomes. It was found to be safe for both healthcare professionals and patients.

Ocular complications occur in 50% − 70% of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients [1], involving diverse manifestations including retinopathy, opportunistic infections, rare tumors, and neuro-ophthalmic disorders [2]. Although HIV infection was historically considered a contraindication for corneal refractive surgery, widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART) now preserves immune function in most patients. With life expectancy approaching that of HIV-negative individuals [3], refractive surgery requests from well-controlled HIV patients are increasing. This necessitates evidence-based guidelines for refractive surgery in seropositive patients with undetectable viral loads.

Some surveys and studies indicate that about 50% of refractive surgeons believe HIV-positive patients can be considered for refractive surgery, while a significantly lower proportion view patients with AIDS as acceptable candidates [4]. A recent guideline from the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) lists autoimmune or other immune-mediated diseases as an absolute contraindication to refractive surgery, while disease control is only a relative contraindication [5].

At present, there is a significant lack of studies on refractive surgery for HIV-positive patients. One prior study examined the incidence and risk factors of complications after corneal refractive surgery in HIV-infected patients at different stages, which shows that the complications of refractive surgery in HIV-positive patients are uncommon, and the probability of complications in photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is greater than that of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) [6], but there is a lack of research on the results of surgery. Therefore, this study will report the clinical outcomes and safety of lamellar keratorefractive surgery in HIV-positive patients.

HIV-positive patients (according to the Expert consensus on perioperative antiviral therapy for the HIV-infected population in China, CD4+T-cell count of more than 350 cells/µl [7]. Starting from October 2021, according to the second edition of the consensus, CD4+T-cell count of more than 500 cells/µl [8]).

Before surgery, all patients were provided with details and risks of the surgery, significance to ensure informed consent. This included all available treatment options, associated side effects, and potential complications, including the risk of opportunistic corneal infections after surgery. Based on this information, patients signed an informed consent form.

The study strictly adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was reviewed by the Medical Ethics Committee of Ineye Hospital at Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and it received approval under reference number 2023yh-007.

Before surgery, all patients underwent standard preoperative evaluations, including refraction, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), Sirius anterior segment analysis (SCHWIND eye-tech solutions), tear secretion testing, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, fundoscopy, pupil diameter measurement, and corneal thickness assessment.

All operations were performed by the same skilled refractive surgeon. Three days preoperatively, the operated eye was treated with levofloxacin eye drops, sodium hyaluronate eye drops (both administered four times per day).

In the FS-LASIK group utilized the VisuMax 3.0 femtosecond laser (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany) was used to create a corneal flap. The optical zone diameter ranged from 6.2 to 6.5 mm, depending on the degree of refractive error. The flap measured 8.10 mm in diameter, with a thickness of 90–110 μm and a superior hinge. The flap width was 3.53 mm. Following flap creation, stromal ablation was performed using an excimer laser (AMARIS 1050, SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions, Germany), after which the flap was repositioned.

In the SMILE group, the same VisuMax 3.0 femtosecond laser (Zeiss, Germany) to create the corneal lenticule and the corneal cap. The laser operated at a pulse frequency of 500 kHz and an energy level of 135 nJ. The thickness of the corneal cap was set between 100 and 120 μm, with a diameter of 7.5 mm. The diameter of the lens ranged from 6.1 to 6.5 mm, and a 2 mm incision was made at a 90° angle on the cornea. Following the laser scanning, the lens was separated and removed.

Additional precautions taken during elective refractive surgery in persons with HIV positivity: (1) Schedule patient for last on the surgery schedule; (2) Wear a double layer of gloves; (3) Require operating room staff to wear filter masks; (4) Prepare and drape the eyelids and the laser hand controls; (5) Evacuate the laser plume immediately after surgery; (6) Communicate patient status with operating room staff; (7)Increase sterilization time.

During the first week postoperatively, routinely used levofloxacin eye drops (four times/day), tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops (four times/day), and sodium hyaluronate eye drops (four times/day, continued until 3 months postoperatively). Starting at 1 week postoperatively, replaced dexamethasone eye drops with 1 g/l fluorometholone eye drops (administered to 1 month postoperatively, with a gradual reduction during this period).

Postoperative assessments were conducted at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. These included measurements of UDVA, CDVA, IOP, and Sirius anterior segment analysis (SCHWIND eye-tech solutions). A slit lamp examination of the anterior visual field was also performed. Any adverse complications were recorded during these evaluations. Refractive outcomes were assessed by Standard for Reporting Refractive Outcomes of Intraocular Lens-Based Refractive Surgery [9].

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 25.0.The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in Sigma Plot was used to test for normality.For repeated measurements, the paired Studentttest was used for normally distributed data and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed data.Pvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

One year after surgery, the patient’s UDVA showed a significant improvement compared to before the procedure. The overall UDVA increased from 1.36 ± 0.18 LogMAR to −0.11 ± 0.07 LogMAR, while SMILE increased from 1.37 ± 0.18 LogMAR to −0.09 ± 0.07 LogMAR, FS-LASIK increased from 1.35 ± 0.19 LogMAR to −0.11 ± 0.06 LogMAR (allP< 0.001). Postoperatively, 100% of patients achieved UDVA of 20/20 or better, 60.71% had UDVA of 20/16 or better (SMILE 58.33% vs. FS-LASIK 62.50%), 10.71% had UDVA of 20/12.5 or better (SMILE 8.33% vs. FS-LASIK 12.50%). Only 2 eyes in SMILE decreased 1-line in CDVA. Overall, CDVA did not change significantly (P= 0.059), from − 0.06 ± 0.06 LogMAR to −0.09 ± 0.06 LogMAR. For SMILE, CDVA was from − 0.06 ± 0.05 LogMAR to −0.05 ± 0.05 LogMAR (P= 0.67). While FS-LASIK increased from − 0.06 ± 0.07 LogMAR to −0.12 ± 0.04 LogMAR in CDVA (P= 0.01)(see Fig.1A, B).

Compared to the preoperative period, the mean SE improved from − 6.42 ± 1.46 D preoperatively to −0.06 ± 0.04 D (P< 0.001). SMILE eyes improved from − 6.00 ± 0.92 D to −0.01 ± 0.26 D, while FS-LASIK eyes improved from − 6.74 ± 1.72 D to −0.09 ± 0.49 D, with a statistically significant difference (allP< 0.001). Scatter plot and linear regression analyses demonstrated a strong correlation between the actual achieved and expected SE measured one year postoperatively. Refractive predictability outcomes revealed 89.29% of eyes within ± 0.5 D of the expected correction (SMILE 100% vs. FS-LASIK 87.50%), around 96.43% within ± 1.00 D (SMILE 100% vs. FS-LASIK 93.75%), and 96.00% with astigmatism ≤ 0.50 D (SMILE 100% vs. FS-LASIK 93.75%) (see Fig.1C, D, E, F).

During the follow-up period, no serious complications, such as diffuse lamellar keratitis or corneal infection, were detected. 4 patients experienced more noticeable dry eye symptoms in both eyes within 6 months after surgery: 2 patients (4 eyes) after LASIK and 2 patients (4 eyes) after SMILE. They were treated with artificial tears, and their condition improved after 6 months. Furthermore, there were no cases of non-infectious retinopathy, uveitis, tumors, or neuro-ophthalmopathy.

Additionally, no HIV seroconversion was observed among healthcare staff during the study period, consistent with additional precautions.

To the authors’ knowledge, there have been no studies on the clinical outcomes of refractive surgery in HIV-positive patients. Immunodeficiency is listed as a contraindication for refractive surgery. However, a patient with HIV does not mean that their immunity is low. AIDS is defined as a CD4+T-lymphocyte count below 200 cells/µl and/or the presence of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. In various surgical procedures, CD4+T-lymphocyte counts in patients with HIV/AIDS are commonly used as a primary indicator for assessing immune function. However, there is no standardized criteria for this assessment. In the field of orthopaedics, for instance, Abalo et al. [10] found that CD4+T-lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/µl were linked to an increased risk of postoperative site infections in trauma patients. Additionally, other studies have indicated that counts below 300 cells/µl are associated with a higher likelihood of postoperative infections following fractures [11]. In China, it is widely accepted that HIV infection, when accompanied by CD4+T-lymphocyte counts exceeding 500 cells/µl, does not impact the typical conduct of surgical procedures [12]. Complications were uncommon among HIV-positive participants following refractive surgery. Point estimates indicate that PRK may present a higher risk of complications compared to LASIK, and that advanced HIV, as indicated by a history of AIDS, might be associated with an increased likelihood of complications [6]. Approximately 77% of AIDS patients at clinical stage III or higher experience ocular complications [13]. Therefore, we excluded these patients from consideration for refractive surgery. Ultimately, we based our assessment of the preoperative immune status of HIV-positive patients on the criteria outlined in the Chinese Consensus on Perioperative Antiretroviral Therapy for the HIV-Infected Population and its second edition [7,8].

In this study, all patients achieved promising clinical outcomes one year postoperatively. Notably, 100% UDVA ≥ 20/20, 60.71% UDVA ≥ 20/16, and 10.71% UDVA ≥ 20/12.5 showed excellent long-term visual acuity. Importantly, there was no significant delay in visual acuity recovery during follow-up. In terms of CDVA, there was no significant loss of CDVA at 1 year postoperatively (P= 0.059), and all patients had at least 20/20 (≤ 0.00logMAR) CDVA, and only 2 eyes (7.14%) of those treated with SMILE showed a loss of 1 line of CDVA. The visual outcomes were comparable to other participats treated with FS-LASIK [14,15]and SMILE [16,17].

In terms of refraction, the SE improved significantly from (−6.42 ± 1.46) D to (−0.06 ± 0.04) D one year after surgery, compared to the preoperative period (P< 0.001). Approximately 89.29% of the eyes fell within the expected correction of ± 0.50 D, and about 96.43% were within the expected correction of ± 1.00 D, and 96% of the astigmatism measurements were ≤ 0.50 D. In this small cohort, positive-HIV appeared not to affect predictability of lamellar keratorefractive surgery, though larger studies are needed to confirm this observation. Sekundo et al. [18] reported that six months after SMILE surgery, the SE was (−0.01 ± 0.49) D. In their findings, 80.2% of patients were within the expected correction range of ± 0.50D, and 95.6% were within ± 1.00D. In a study focusing on myopic astigmatism one year after SMILE, it was found that 43.3% of patients were within ± 0.50D, while 73.1% were within ± 1.00D [19]. Notably, all SMILE patients in this study were within ± 0.50D one year postoperatively. Zhou et al. [20] studied FS-LASIK for eyes with high myopia and found that 58.7% achieved ± 0.50D of attempted correction, and 76.1% achieved ± 1.00D of attempted correction. Only one eye from the FS-LASIK patients had an SE greater than − 1.00D one year postoperatively; this case was noted to be due to the patient’s high preoperative myopia (preoperative SE of −9.00 D).

Postoperative complications are a key focus for us. A significant concern is the reduction of CD4+T cells, which is closely linked to the occurrence of opportunistic infections [21]. Pathogens that can cause infections of the ocular surface and its adnexa include varicella-zoster virus, Molluscum contagiosum virus, and certain protozoan parasites such as sporozoite-stage organisms.Some studies indicate that HIV-positive patients have more than a threefold increased risk of developing herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in the eyes [22]. While opportunistic infections can lead to infectious keratitis following keratoconus, there are relatively few reports on this issue. Currently, there is only one documented case of bilateral bacterial keratitis after LASIK surgery in an HIV-positive patient [23]. A study by Carter et al. [6] reported three cases of corneal ulceration possibly linked to refractive surgery, all of which occurred after PRK. These cases were thought to be associated with the breakdown of the corneal epithelial barrier caused by the PRK procedure, as well as with the patients’ status regarding AIDS. Notably, the patients in this study did not experience ocular infections postoperatively. The authors attribute this to the patients’ preoperative immune status, particularly a CD4 count more than 350 cells/µl. Additionally, it has been suggested that HIV-infected individuals may be more susceptible to blepharitis and dry keratoconjunctivitis [24]. This could be due to HIV acting as an inflammatory mediator, which disrupts the ocular surface and lacrimal function [25]. In the study, the incidence of dry eye observed was 28.57% (SMILE 2/6; FS-LASIK 2/8), compared to the typical range of 20–40% in the general population 6 months after LASIK [26]. Denoyer et al. [27] reported that 20% of SMILE patients required treating with artificial tears after 6 months postoperatively. Importantly, HIV infection did not appear to increase the incidence of dry eye in patients undergoing lamellar keratoconus refractive surgery and other complications were not monitored in this study.

There is a growing concern regarding the risk of HIV transmission associated with refractive surgery. Some refractive surgeons may hesitate to perform corneal refractive surgery on HIV-positive patients due to the potential for viral transmission. To investigate this possibility, Hagen et al. [28] conducted an experiment where they applied an excimer laser to virus-infected tissue culture plates and then inverted uninfected tissue culture plates onto the infected ones. A total of 600 laser pulses were applied, and the experiment was repeated 20 times, with all uninfected plates remaining free of infection. The author suggests that, in comparison to excimer lasers, femtosecond lasers operate within the interior of the cornea. This means that the particles or aerosols produced during laser scanning are less likely to enter the air, reducing the risk of virus transmission. However, some researchers have observed that AIDS patients who have achieved an HIV-negative status in their blood after long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) may still have a high viral load of HIV in their tears [29]. This underscores the necessity of stringent surgical safety protocols—including double-gloving, dedicated instruments, and postoperative device sterilization validated for viral elimination—to mitigate potential transmission risks despite systemic viral suppression. In this study, we implemented additional precautions when performing surgery on HIV-positive patients (see METHODS for details). Ultimately, all staff involved in the surgery remained free of HIV infection.

In conclusion, we found that laser lamellar corneal refractive surgery in HIV-positive patients led to promising clinical outcomes and was safe for both healthcare professionals and patients with the implementation of additional protective measures. However, further research with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods is necessary to confirm these findings.
