Cognitive dysfunction is one of the main clinical features in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Over time, cognitive decline related to CSVD might evolve into dementia. This study aims to explore the changes in brain functional networks of CSVD patients with cognitive impairment through microstate analysis of resting-state electroencephalogram, and to investigate the association between these changes and cognitive dysfunction.

A cohort of 42 CSVD patients from the Department of Neurology at the Third People's Hospital of Mianyang City was recruited between September 2023 and March 2024, constituting the CSVD group. Concurrently, 40 individuals who underwent health checkups served as the control group (HC group). Both groups underwent neuropsychological assessments and 19-channel video EEG recordings. EEG data were analyzed using the MICROSTATELAB 1.0 toolbox to identify microstates. Four microstate prototypes (Ms) were derived, and their temporal characteristics were compared across groups. Moreover, correlations between these characteristics and neuropsychological scale scores were examined.

1. Neuropsychological assessments indicated that the CSVD group scored significantly lower than the HC group in general cognitive level, memory, visuospatial ability, executive function, and language function (p< 0.05). 2. In resting-state EEG microstate analysis, the CSVD group exhibited significantly lower appearance rates for MsA, MsB, MsC, and MsD compared to the HC group (p= 0.014,p= 0.047,p= 0.014,p= 0.02). Durations of MsB, MsC, and MsD were prolonged in the CSVD group (p= 0.014,p= 0.037,p= 0.036). Furthermore, the MsC to MsA transition rate was significantly reduced in the CSVD group (p= 0.036). 3. Correlation analysis within the CSVD group revealed several significant relationships. The MsD to MsC transition rate was negatively correlated with the AD8 score (p= 0.049,r=  − 0.309). The MsD occurrence rate was negatively correlated with the FAQ score (p= 0.039,r=  − 0.324). The MsA to MsC transition rate was positively correlated with the FAQ score (p= 0.038,r= 0.326). The MsD occurrence rate was positively correlated with MMSE (p= 0.027,r= 0.345). The MsA to MsB transition rate was negatively correlated with MMSE (p= 0.041,r=  − 0.321). The MsB duration was negatively correlated with DST scores (p= 0.027,r=  − 0.345). The MsD occurrence was positively correlated with BNT scores (p= 0.031,r= 0.338). MsA coverage, MsA to MsB transition rate, and MsB to MsA transition rate were negatively correlated with Stroop C scores [(p= 0.019,r=  − 0.364), (p= 0.01,r=  − 0.399), (p= 0.022,r=  − 0.358)]. The MsC to MsD transition rate and MsD to MsC transition rate were positively correlated with the Stroop C score [(p= 0.014,r= 0.381), (p= 0.01,r= 0.397)].

The CSVD group demonstrated increased stability in brain functional networks but reduced inter-network interaction capabilities. Network activities related to MsA and MsB were enhanced, while those related to MsC were diminished. Abnormal changes in microstates were correlated with cognitive deficits in CSVD patients, suggesting that microstate alterations could serve as potential biomarkers for CSVD-related cognitive impairment.

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) encompasses cerebrovascular disorders affecting the small intracranial vessels, including arteries, microarterioles, capillaries, and microveins, with diameters ranging from 50 to 400 µm [1]. It is strongly linked to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), particularly subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) [2]. The onset of CSVD is gradual, marked by a slow progression, and its symptoms are often nonspecific. Detecting CSVD in its early stages poses a significant challenge. As the disease advances, CSVD patients progressively develop a series of cognitive and neurological dysfunctions, characterized by cognitive decline (especially impairments in executive function, information processing speed, and attention) [3], balance and gait abnormalities, psycho-emotional changes, urinary incontinence, and a reduced ability to perform daily living tasks. Ultimately, this progression leads to dementia and complete social isolation, significantly compromising the quality of life for those affected [4,5].

Microstate analysis, a technique utilizing electroencephalogram (EEG) data for functional brain imaging due to its high temporal resolution, offers a promising avenue for early detection of CSVD [6]. This method involves segmenting EEG data into quasi-stable oscillatory states, known as microstates (Ms), each characterized by specific durations and topological features reflecting core information processing functions in the human brain [7,8]. Currently, based on clustering analysis, Ms are typically classified into four main types: MsA, MsB, MsC, and MsD [9], which roughly correspond to the auditory network (AN), visual network (VN), salient network (SN), and dorsal attentional network (DAN), respectively. Therefore, microstate analysis can be utilized to assess large-scale brain networks [10,11]. In our previous studies, we effectively applied microstate analysis techniques to investigate alterations in brain dynamics across various neurological conditions such as acute cerebellar and brainstem infarcts [12], migraine headaches [13], and autoimmune encephalitis [14]. However, research on the brain network mechanisms for CSVD-related cognitive dysfunction remains insufficient.

Building upon the robust methodological framework established in prior research, the present study sought to elucidate the neural network mechanisms associated with cognitive deficits in CSVD. It compared the temporal parameters (duration, occurrence, coverage, and transition) of four microshapes in patients with CSVD-related cognitive impairment to those in healthy controls through EEG microshape analysis. Additionally, the study developed a microstructure-based functional connectivity brain network model during resting-state conditions, shedding light on potential implications for clinical assessments and therapeutic interventions in this population.

A cohort of 42 patients diagnosed with CSVD was admitted to the Department of Neurology at the Third People's Hospital of Mianyang City between September 2023 and March 2024, with an average age of 70.40 ± 6.897 years. All patients fulfilled the imaging diagnostic criteria as specified in the STRIVE-2 guidelines from 2023 [1] and met the cognitive impairment diagnostic criteria outlined in the Chinese Guidelines for Diagnosing and Treating Cognitive Impairment Associated with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease [2]. CSVD was identified as the primary etiology of their cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, a control group (referred to as the HC group) comprising 40 individuals who had undergone routine health assessments during the same period was included, with an average age of 69.13 ± 6.646 years. All participants underwent a comprehensive baseline evaluation, encompassing the collection of demographic data, medical history assessment, neuropsychological testing, as well as MRI and MRA scans of the brain. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion in the study.

Exclusion criteria: 1. diagnosed cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Parkinson’s dementia, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and prion infections; 2. cerebral white matter lesions attributed to causes such as toxicity, degeneration, infectious diseases, etc.; 3. presence of infarcted lesions exceeding 20 mm in diameter on cranial MRI; 4. intracranial and extracranial lesions linked to severe macrovascular issues; 5. severe visual or hearing impairments, and significant limb movement disorders. Patients unable to cooperate with neuropsychological tests or EEG are excluded.

The data collection process encompasses the following general information related to the study subjects: name, gender, age, history of smoking and drinking, educational background, as well as current and prior medical history (e.g., history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, stroke).

The 30-min, 19-lead video EEG data, sampled at a frequency of 500 Hz with electrode impedances ≤ 10 kΩ, were acquired utilizing a Japanese photoelectroencephalograph, specifically the EEG-1200C recorder. The data collection was conducted in a semi-open environment, maintained at a comfortable temperature and with subdued lighting, to ensure that the subjects remained alert and in a seated position with their eyes closed. Electrode placement adhered to the international 10–20 system, comprising a total of 19 recording electrodes and two reference electrodes.

Overall cognitive screening: Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The maximum score on the MoCA is 30 points, with a score greater than 26 indicative of normal cognitive function, while scores below 26 suggest cognitive dysfunction. A lower score on the MoCA indicates a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment [15]. The MMSE also has a total score of 30 points, with a score of 27 or higher considered normal, and a score below 27 indicating cognitive dysfunction. Additionally, MMSE scores of 24–26 may suggest mild cognitive impairment, 18–23 indicate moderate impairment, and scores below 17 are associated with severe cognitive impairment [15].

Memory assessment: Auditory Word-Learning Test (AVLT), Memory Disorders Self-Assessment Inventory (AD8).

Visuospatial function assessment: Complex Figure Reproduction (Rey-O Pictures) covering both copying and recall.

Executive function assessment: Color Word Test (Stroop-A, Stroop-B, Stroop-C), Digit Symbol Transformation Test (SDMT), Digit Breadth Test (DST).

Verbal function assessment: Boston Naming Test Chinese Version 30 items (BNT-30).

Assessments of sleep quality, daily living skills, and emotional state: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Ability to Perform Daily Living (ADL), Functional Acquisition Questionnaire (FAQ), Informed Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9).

All assessments were administered by a specialized neurologist following standardized protocols and utilizing consistent assessment tools.

In this study, EEGlab (v13.6.5) within the MATLAB (R2016a) software platform was utilized for the standardized preprocessing of raw EEG data. A 50 Hz trap filter was applied to eliminate interference from the power line frequency, while an Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-based approach was employed to eliminate artifacts such as eye movements and EMG activity. Abnormal signals were identified using the standard deviation thresholding method with a threshold set at 4 standard deviations. Spherical interpolation was then applied to correct any malfunctioning channels within the data. Files with more than two malfunctioning channels were excluded from further analysis. Subsequently, a bandpass filter ranging from 1 to 45 Hz was used to eliminate low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise from the EEG signals. The reference electrode was established as the mean reference point, and five 10-s segments of resting-state EEG data were extracted from each participant for subsequent microstate analysis.

where N represents the total number of electrodes, i represents a single electrode, Vi(t) represents the potential value of theith electrode at time t, and Vmean(t) refers to the average potential value of all electrodes at time t.

Clustering: the k-means clustering algorithm was employed to analyze the clustering of the original topographic maps. The optimal number of clusters was ascertained through cross-validation, yielding four representative microstate-averaged topographic map templates.

Post-fitting: the derived microstate templates were applied to the GFP data of each participant. Each time sample was allocated to the most analogous prototype by calculating the spatial correlation coefficients, resulting in a microstate time series comprising the four prototypes A, B, C, and D in alternation (i.e., MsA, MsB, MsC, and MsD).

Calculation of microstate time parameters: several parameters of the microstates were calculated, including average duration, frequency of occurrence, coverage, and transition rate. The average duration signifies the average length of time during which a specific microstate topology predominates. The frequency of occurrence represents the number of times a particular microstate predominates within a unit of time. The coverage rate reflects the proportion of total time during which a microstate dominates, while the transition rate indicates the frequency at which shifts to other microstates occur within a unit of time [7].

Data were analyzed in this study using SPSS 27.0 software. To account for potential confounding factors, a generalized linear model (GLM) incorporating gender and age was employed. For variables meeting the normality assumption, descriptive statistics were presented as mean ± standard deviation (x̄ ± s) and compared using independent samples t-tests. Variables not meeting the normality assumption were presented as median and interquartile range, and compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Microstate temporal parameters were compared between groups with two-sample t-tests, and their correlations with neuropsychological scores were examined using Pearson’s method.

Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, this study enrolled a total of 42 individuals diagnosed with CSVD and 40 healthy controls (HCs). As delineated in Table1, comparative analysis revealed no statistically significant disparities in age, gender, and educational attainment between the CSVD cohort and the HC group (p> 0.05). Conversely, the CSVD cohort demonstrated markedly lower neuropsychological scores when compared to the HC group across several domains, including general cognition, episodic memory, visuospatial skills, executive functions, verbal abilities, affective-cognitive processing, and activities of daily living (p< 0.001). However, no significant difference in sleep quality was observed between the two groups (p> 0.05).

By K-means clustering analysis, four microstates labeled MsA, MsB, MsC, and MsD (Fig.1) were finally obtained in the CSVD and HC groups, which presented right frontal-left occipital, left frontal-right occipital, left–right symmetrical occipitofrontal midline, and frontal midline distribution patterns. These findings align with prior research on the subject, validating the consistency of the observed patterns.

The microstate parameters (duration, occurrence, coverage, and transition) of the CSVD group and the HC group are shown in Fig.2. Compared with the HC group, the MsA and MsB characteristics of the CSVD group increase, but the MsC and MsD characteristics weakened. The results indicate that the duration coverage of MsA, MsB, and MsD in the CSVD group was higher than that in the HC group, while the duration coverage of MsC was lower when compared to the HC group. However, the comparison of the coverage results for each microstate did not yield statistically significant differences. Further, the incidence rates of microstates MsA, MsB, MsC, and MsD in the CSVD group were lower than those in the HC group (p= 0.014,p= 0.047,p= 0.014,p= 0.02). The microstates in the CSVD group (MsB, MsC, and MsD) displayed extended durations, particularly for MsB, MsC, and MsD, which were significantly different from the durations observed in the HC group (p= 0.014,p= 0.037,p= 0.036). While the duration of MsA in the CSVD group also showed an extension, this difference did not reach statistical significance when compared to the HC group. Examining the results of microstate transfer probability, it was observed that the conversion rates from MsB and MsD to MsA were higher in the CSVD group than in the HC group, but the conversion rate from MsC to MsA was decreased (p= 0.036). Additionally, the conversion rates from MsA, MsC, and MsD to MsB were higher in the CSVD group when compared to the HC group. Conversely, the conversion rates from MsA to MsC and MsD in the CSVD group were decreased when compared to the HC group. The microstate analysis verified an altered dynamic activity pattern in the brains of CSVD patients, highlighting the dominance of microstates A and B, with more frequent transitions between MsA and MsB when compared to the HC group. This distinctive pattern may be correlated with abnormal information exchange and reduced network dynamic complexity in the brains of individuals with CSVD.

Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the association between microstates and neuropsychological test scores in the CSVD cohort. The results are presented in Fig.3.

In evaluating the functional capacity of individuals within the CSVD cohort to engage in daily activities, it was observed that there exists a significant negative correlation between the frequency of microstate MsD and the FAQ score (r=  − 0.324,p= 0.039). In addition, the frequency of transitions from MsA to either MsC or MsD (MsA → MsC transitions) exhibited positive correlations with FAQ scores (r= 0.326,p= 0.038) and with ADL scores (r= 0.320,p= 0.041). These results suggest that the frequency of MsD and the transition rates of MsA to MsD and MsA to MsC are strongly correlated with patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living.

Subsequent analyses showed that the frequency of MsD → MsC transitions was negatively correlated with AD8 scores (r=  − 0.309,p= 0.049), whereas the frequency of MsD occurrence was also negatively correlated with IQCODE scores (r=  − 0.359,p= 0.021). In contrast, the duration of MsC was positively correlated with IQCODE scores (r= 0.341,p= 0.029). These findings suggest that the rate of microstate MsD → MsC transitions, the frequency of MsD, and the duration of MsC may be related to memory impairment.

In the overall cognitive state–microstate correlation analysis, there was a positive correlation observed between the incidence of MsD and MMSE scores (r= 0.345,p= 0.027). Conversely, a negative correlation was found between the transition rate from MsA to MsB and MMSE scores (r=  − 0.321,p= 0.041). These results imply that decreased occurrence of MsD and increased transitions from MsA to MsB may be indicative of a decline in overall cognitive functioning.

Furthermore, a negative correlation was identified between the temporal extent of MsA and Stroop C scores (r=  − 0.364,p= 0.019). Additionally, negative associations were observed between the transition rates from MsA to MsB (r=  − 0.399,p= 0.01), from MsB to MsA (r=  − 0.358,p= 0.022), and Stroop C scores. In another executive function test, the duration of MsB was negatively correlated with the DST score (r=  − 0.345,p= 0.027). The above results suggest that the higher the coverage of MsA, the longer the duration of MsB, and the higher the interconversion rate between MsA and MsB, the more severe the impairment of executive function. Meanwhile, a positive correlation was observed between the transition rate of MsC to MsD and the Stroop C score (r= 0.381,p= 0.014), while the transition rate from MsD to MsC showed a similar positive correlation with Stroop C scores (r= 0.397,p= 0.01). This may suggest that the lower the reciprocal transition rate between MsC and MsD, the more impaired the executive function.

In addition, the verbal functioning test revealed a positive correlation between the rate of occurrence of MsD and BNT scores (r= 0.338,p= 0.031), suggesting that altered temporal characteristics of MsD may also be strongly associated with impaired verbal functioning.

The brain, as a highly dynamic and complex distributed information-processing system, requires the synchronization of extensive brain networks, even during periods of rest [18]. In this study, we employed resting-state EEG microstate analysis to investigate changes in functional brain network connectivity and neural mechanisms in patients with CSVD and to explore the relationship between their EEG characteristics and cognitive functions.

The four microstate topographies identified in this study show a high degree of consistency with previously published findings [19]. Earlier studies have established a strong association between distinct microstates and specific resting-state networks (RSNs) [20,21]. Specifically, MsA is believed to be linked to auditory and visual information processing as well as arousal mechanisms, aligning with the functions of AN and SMN [20]. In the present study, we found that MsA parameters exhibited significant alterations in the CSVD group compared to the HC group, likely attributable to pathological alterations in the temporal lobe and disruptions in the neural network induced by CSVD [9,22,23]. Importantly, our study revealed a marginal increase in the duration and spatial coverage, paired with a noteworthy decrease in the frequency of MsA among CSVD patients, contrasting with findings from a study that reported higher frequency and coverage of MsA in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This suggests a potential relationship between MsA and cognitive decline, indicating that the pattern of MsA may vary across different diseases [10,11]. State alteration patterns may differ [24].

The time-domain characteristics of MsB in the CSVD group were characterized by a reduced incidence and significantly longer duration. This observation aligns partially with the data obtained from AD patients [25]. Previous studies reported that MsB coverage and duration were significantly increased in AD patients compared to the HC and MCI groups and that this change may be exacerbated as the course of AD progresses [25]. Similarly, whole-brain microstate dynamics were found to be abnormal in patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD), as evidenced by prolonged duration and reduced frequency of all microstates. The mean duration of these microstates was found to be correlated with the intensity of cognitive fluctuations, implying that disruptions in the equilibrium of microstate dynamics could be the neural substrate for cognitive deficits [26]. Consistent with these findings, correlation analysis in the present study found a significant negative correlation between MsB duration and DST scores, suggesting that the degree of perceptual impairment may be positively correlated with MsB duration on a gradient basis [27,28]. Given that MsB is associated with negative BOLD activation in visual areas, there is a strong association with the functional integrity of the visual network; thus, the modulation of its temporal parameters may mirror the neural mechanisms by which CSVD patients enhance the efficiency of visual information processing to compensate for cognitive deficits [10,29]. The conversion rate analysis demonstrated that the interconversion rates between MsA and MsB in the CSVD group were uniformly elevated compared to the HC group, suggesting an augmented functional connectivity between auditory and visual networks in CSVD patients with cognitive impairment. This finding further substantiates the notion that brain activity becomes more concentrated on visual functions in the presence of cognitive impairment [29].

The present study suggests that MsC is associated with positive BOLD activation in specific brain regions, including the posterior part of the anterior cingulate gyrus cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, right anterior insula, and left pontine nucleus, which may reflect the function of the SN and suggests that the activity in this region plays a key role in the switch between the central executive network (CEN) and the default mode network (DMN) [10]. Previous studies on microstates in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have demonstrated a significant reduction in MsC duration among FTD patients. The primary lesions in FTD are located in the frontotemporal lobe and insular cingulate gyrus, aligning with the observed changes in MsC. This correlation suggests that MsC may serve as a marker for the decline in specific cognitive functions associated with cognitive impairment [30]. Notably, although AD patients do not show significant damage to the insula–cingulate gyrus network, there is a noted reduction in the mean duration of their microstates, potentially linked to the disintegration of synchronized neuronal activity due to neuronal degeneration [31]. In contrast to the results found in FTD and AD, the present study suggests that the CSVD group exhibited a significant decrease in MsC frequency and an increase in MsC duration, which indicates that the functional brain networks associated with MsC have a limited ability to switch, and the decrease in information integration efficiency is offset by the extended duration of specific microstates. Correlation analyses with neuropsychological tests have demonstrated a significant association between MsC parameters and overall cognitive performance and memory function. This finding is partially consistent with previous studies on cognitive impairment, suggesting the presence of functional anomalies in the SN of CSVD patients, which may be linked to the disruption of the DMN [25–28,32,33]. It is hypothesized that as cognitive impairment progresses in CSVD patients, the connectivity within the DMN network may gradually weaken, and this weakening is in line with the observed difficulties in attention, spatial and temporal perception, visuospatial processing, and executive functions in CSVD patients [32–34].

Current evidence suggests that the origin of MsD is predominantly associated with the frontal-parietal control network region, and the temporal characteristics of MsD correspond closely to the functional dynamics of the DAN [10]. MsD is intricately linked to attentional and executive control processes, including sophisticated neural functions such as working memory and cognitive regulation. In terms of temporal dynamics, the attenuation of temporal domain features in MsD may trigger attention deficits [35]. Research on MCI indicates that the shortened duration and reduced spatial extent of MsD in the MCI cohort point toward a reduction in the intensity of DAN functional operations, which may lead directly to cognitive control deterioration and atypical allocation of attentional resources in MCI patients [25]. In the present study, we found that the frequency of MsD was significantly reduced in the CSVD group compared with the HC group, and this result is basically consistent with the typical pathological manifestations of CSVD damage to frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits and damage to white matter fiber tracts in the DMN and other brain regions [36,37]. The neuropsychological assessment data from the present study support the notion that MsD feature attenuation is also involved in the process of cognitive impairment in CSVD patients.

Existing studies have shown that microstate transitions in healthy populations and patients with certain diseases are non-randomized [38,39]. The transition probabilities among various microstates can reflect the dynamic characteristics of the transient functional states of the brain, and the order and frequency of the transitions are of great value in revealing the regulatory mechanisms within brain networks [38]. This study revealed significant differences in the transition rates between Ms in individuals of the CSVD group and those in the HC group. Specifically, the transition from MsB and MsD to MsA was more frequent in the CSVD group, as was the transition from MsA, MsC, and MsD to MsB. Additionally, the CSVD group exhibited increased transitions between MsA and MsB, while transitions between MsC and MsD were less frequent compared to the HC group. Correlation analysis further indicated that the rates at which microstates A and B interchange were inversely related to performance on the Stroop C test. Conversely, the transition rates between MsC and MsD were positively associated with Stroop C scores. Based on the analysis of the RSNs corresponding to the four microstates, the impairment of cognitive deficits related to CSVD, particularly the impairment of executive functioning, may result from the inhibition of network connectivity, such as the DAN, the DMN, and the SN. It is hypothesized that microstates can serve as a mirror for the severity of cognitive impairment, with distinct transition patterns potentially mapping unique cognitive modes and states. Disruptions in these transition sequences could impair normal cognitive function by disrupting the orderly activation of brain networks.

The EEG microstate abnormalities in the patients with CSVD identified in the present study are consistent with the results of previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) studies. Elevated parietal and occipital fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in CSVD patients, reflecting altered spontaneous BOLD signal power, suggests abnormal neural activity [40]. In terms of neural mechanisms, the occipital lobe is involved in visual memory processing and working memory storage through inter-cortical interactions, whereas MsB mainly involves the synergistic activation of bilateral occipital cortex and subcortical structures, the intensity activity of which is directly associated with the functional integrity of the VN. In the present study, we observed enhanced compensatory activity of MsB-related networks in CSVD patients, which is largely consistent with the above fALFF findings. The strength of functional connectivity (FC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and key network nodes, such as the frontal-parietal control network (FPCN) and DAN, was characteristically reduced in CSVD patients [41]. This neural synchronization abnormality was manifested in BOLD signals as diminished synchronized oscillations across brain regions, suggesting decreased efficiency of information transfer within neural networks and impaired synchronization of neuronal clusters, which in turn might further lead to altered microstate characteristics [10]. In the present study, the topological activities of MsC (involving the default mode network) and MsD (involving the attention network) were attenuated, which is generally consistent with the functional imbalance of DMN, FPCN, and DAN revealed in the above rs-fMRI study, further supporting the characterization of functional network disorders in CSVD patients.

Divergent findings emerge from microstate analysis in studies on cognitive impairment in CSVD. These disparities can be linked to variables like sample size, sample characteristics, data gathering approaches, and preprocessing methods. However, collectively, these studies underscore the presence of irregularities in the temporal dynamics of extensive cortical networks in CSVD patients experiencing cognitive decline.

A limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single center with a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the results. A Moreover, the study did not incorporate biomarker assessments, such as those for amyloid, which may have led to undetected co-morbid influences. Future studies should consider multicenter collaborations to expand sample size and diversity and incorporate biomarker tests to improve the reliability and generalizability of the study.

In this study, we investigated the brain-wide functional network changes in patients with CSVD-related cognitive impairment, using EEG microstate analysis. Compared with the HC group, CSVD patients showed increased network activity associated with MsA and MsB, but decreased network activity associated with MsC, suggesting that CSVD-related cognitive impairment is closely related to the alteration of the brain’s functional dynamics. Examining cognitive parameters further revealed varying degrees of decline in overall cognitive functioning and multiple cognitive domains including episodic memory, visuospatial abilities, executive functions, and verbal abilities among CSVD patients. Subsequent analyses unveiled a correlation between the alterations in the microstates’ characteristic parameters in CSVD patients and the outcomes of neuropsychological assessments, accentuating the cognitive domain-specific changes in the temporal domain parameters of various microstate categories.
