Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (TMC OA) is a prevalent and debilitating condition that impairs hand functionality and reduces quality of life. Current treatments including conservative measures such as splinting and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as surgical interventions often exhibit limited efficacy or involve invasive procedures. Novel therapeutic approaches are necessary to address the pain and functional limitations experienced by affected patients.

This study investigates the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from autologous microfragmented adipose tissue (aMAT) as a minimally invasive treatment for TMC OA. EVs were characterized using morphological, proteomic, and functional analyses, revealing their ability to modulate cellular processes through proteins associated with extracellular matrix organization, wound healing, and inflammation regulation.

Functional studies demonstrated that EVs modulate calcium signaling and mitochondrial activity, enhancing cellular bioenergetics and mitigating inflammation-induced dysfunction. In a clinical study with 25 patients diagnosed with TMC OA (Eaton Stage II), aMAT-derived EVs demonstrated significant benefits. Pain scores, measured by the numeric rating scale, improved substantially both at rest and during activity. Functional assessments, including the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire and Kapandji opposition test, showed enhanced hand performance over 12 months. Strength tests indicated marked improvements in pinch grip, with no adverse effects or disease progression observed radiographically.

The findings underscore the potential of aMAT-derived EVs as a novel, effective, and minimally invasive treatment for TMC OA, providing both pain relief and functional recovery. Further randomized trials are necessary to validate these results and investigate broader clinical applications.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising biological agents, capable of delivering active biomolecules to target cells and modulating a range of biological processes [1] These nano-sized particles, secreted by cells, facilitate intercellular communication and influence tissue repair, inflammation, and immune responses [2]. Interest in EVs has grown recently due to their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine and pain management, underscoring the importance of elucidating their precise mechanisms of action [3,4]. Given their ability to deliver proteins, lipids, and genetic material to target cells, EVs represent a promising approach for treating chronic conditions, particularly those involving tissue degeneration and pain, such as musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) [5–7]. MSDs are a significant health concern globally, affecting millions and imposing a high socioeconomic burden. Key MSDs include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), low-back pain, neck pain, and gout [8,9], with OA standing out as the most common degenerative joint disease among adults, significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritis affects one in four adults, with prevalence surging by over 113% from 1990 to 2020 [10]. OA frequently affects the hand, knee, and hip joints, leading to substantial healthcare costs [11]. Notably, hand OA has a high clinical impact due to the extensive loss of functionality in small, complex joints, which contributes to pain and significant disability [12,13]. OA is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, when joint degeneration is irreversible, necessitating surgical intervention [14,15], especially in joints like the thumb’s trapeziometacarpal joint [16].

Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (TMC OA) is a multifactorial degenerative disease that affects not only the articular cartilage, but also the synovial membrane, joint capsule, and periarticular soft tissues. Within this microenvironment, fibroblasts play a central role by producing extracellular matrix components, modulating local inflammation, and influencing tissue remodeling [17]. Emerging evidence has implicated synovial fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of OA through their secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix-degrading enzymes, and their ability to respond to mechanical and biochemical stress [18]. Given their functional relevance and accessibility for in vitro modeling, fibroblasts represent a suitable cellular system to investigate the mechanistic effects of EV-based therapies in OA.

In earlier stages of joint degeneration, conservative treatments such as splinting and the use of analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are typically prescribed [19,20]. Corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid injections have also been applied, though their efficacy remains inconclusive, with guidelines recommending these treatments mainly for mildly symptomatic cases [21,22]. When conservative measures fail, surgical options such as joint arthroplasty or ligament repair become necessary, particularly in cases like TMC joint OA hands [23,24].

Emerging therapies, including the use of platelet-rich plasma and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), offer promising alternatives. MSCs from sources like bone marrow, umbilical cord, synovium, and adipose tissue have demonstrated potential in reducing inflammation and alleviating symptoms through the secretion of paracrine factors [25,26].

Among these sources, adipose tissue offers distinct advantages that make it particularly suitable for clinical use. Compared to bone marrow or umbilical cord-derived MSCs [27], adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) are more abundant, easier to harvest via minimally invasive procedures, and exhibit a strong paracrine secretory profile. Moreover, the use of autologous adipose tissue reduces immunogenicity risks and complies more readily with current regulatory frameworks, especially when processed via minimal manipulation methods such as microfragmentation. These characteristics support the rationale for selecting autologous microfragmented adipose tissue (aMAT) as the tissue source in this study and highlight its translational potential in regenerative approaches for OA and pain.

In particular, aMAT has gained attention for its regenerative potential in joint pathologies [28–30]. This tissue is commonly prepared using non-enzymatic methods, resulting in minimally manipulated products that comply with regulatory standards [31]. aMAT contains a heterogeneous population of cells, including MSCs, pericytes, preadipocytes, and immune cells [32]. Among them, AD-MSCs are particularly abundant and play a crucial role in tissue repair due to their potent paracrine activity. AD-MSCs are known to secrete EVs enriched in cytokines, growth factors, and microRNAs that can modulate inflammation, promote matrix remodeling, and influence pain signaling [33,34]. These properties make them a promising candidate for regenerative approaches in OA and pain management.

Despite advancements in MSC-based therapies, significant gaps remain in understanding the mechanisms through which EVs modulate nociceptive pathways. EVs derived from aMAT may bridge this gap by providing a minimally invasive therapeutic option. Their ability to influence inflammation, extracellular matrix organization, and cellular bioenergetics highlights their potential not only for joint preservation but also for effective pain management. Given the limitations of conventional therapies, exploring EV-mediated mechanisms in pain modulation could revolutionize treatment paradigms for OA and other chronic conditions.

Considering such consideration in this study, we focus on characterizing EVs derived from aMAT, specifically analyzing their potential to alleviate osteoarticular pain. Building on our expertise in EV isolation and characterization, we aim to identify the mechanisms by which these vesicles interact with nociceptive receptors to modulate pain. Our approach includes morphological, proteomic, and functional analyses of these vesicles, with the goal of elucidating pathways involved in pain perception and assessing their efficacy in clinical pain.

Through both in vitro and in vivo on human studies, this investigation aims to advance our understanding of EV-mediated pain modulation, potentially paving the way for innovative, minimally invasive treatments for OA and related chronic pain conditions.

Patients were positioned supine, and local anesthesia was administered. A small incision was made to introduce a blunt cannula attached to a Luer-lock 60-cc syringe. Klein sterile solution, containing saline and lidocaine, was injected into the subcutaneous fat layer of either the abdominal or thigh region. Subsequently, approximately 30 mL of adipose tissue was extracted.

The collected lipoaspirate was processed under sterile conditions in a closed system using Rigenera®technology (HBW, Turin, Italy). This non-enzymatic approach is specifically designed to disaggregate human tissues such as adipose tissue, dental pulp, cartilage, dermis, and bone for reapplication. The process has been documented in multiple studies [35–39]. This disposable device progressively reduces the size of adipose tissue clusters from their initial dimensions of 1–3.5 mm to finer fragments measuring 0.2–0.8 mm, resulting in an adipose microfragments. The surgical workflow consists of two stages: liposuction followed by tissue disaggregation to create microfragments. In this procedure, 4 mL of lipoaspirate was mechanically fragmented using Rigeneracons®(Human Brain Wave S.r.L., Turin, Italy) while mixing with 4 mL of saline solution. This process yielded approximately 6–7 mL of microfragmented adipose tissue, ready for direct application. All procedural steps—including the volume of lipoaspirate (30 mL), anatomical site of collection (abdomen or thigh), and processing time—were standardized across all patients to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

aMAT was resuspended in 10 mL of sterile PBS for 24 h and then the conditioned PBS (cPBS) was harvested and centrifuged at 2000×gfor 5 min at 4 °C to eliminated cells and debris. The clarified cPBS has been applied to Amicon Ultra-15 100 kDa centrifugal devices (Millipore, MA, USA) which had been pre-sterilized with 70% ethyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MA, USA). The devices were centrifuged at 2000xg for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting filtrate was then washed with sterile PBS (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) via another centrifugation step at 2000×gfor 20 min at + 4 °C. The isolated aMAT-EVs were recovered from the filtering unit and promptly stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. aMAT-EV protein content was determined with the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and absorbance at 540 nm was measured with the Perkin Elmer VICTOR X3 MultiLabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). aMAT-EV dimension was analyzed with the tuneable resistive pulse sensing instrument qNano Gold (IZON Science LTD, Christchurch, New Zealand). Measurements were performed at a pressure of 20 mbar and normalized using 100 nm calibration particles. Data were analyzed with the qNano Control Suite Software.

aMAT-EV morphology was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The EVs were first fixed in a 2% glutaraldehyde solution in phosphate buffer (1:1 ratio), following a previously outlined protocol [40]. Subsequently, the fixed EVs were deposited, rinsed, and stained with heavy metal compounds on a gridded slide using standard procedures. Imaging was performed using a TEM Zeiss EM 910 instrument (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Exosomal markers were examined with the Exo-Check™ Exosome Antibody Array (Systems Biosciences, Palo Alto, California, USA) and Exosome-human CD81 or CD63 Flow Detection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions [41]. PE-conjugated anti-human CD81 monoclonal antibody or PE-conjugated anti-human CD63 monoclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used in flow cytometric analysis. Negative control was performed by staining PBS (vehicle) instead of aMAT-EVs. Attune™ NxT Acoustic Focusing Cytometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) and the Attune NxT Soft-ware version 2.5 data were used.

The cellular uptake of aMAT-EVs was observed by labelling the EVs with PKH26 (PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Midi Kit for General Cell Membrane Labelling; Sigma-Aldrich). EVs were stained with a solution of diluent C and PKH26 dye, followed by blocking with an equal volume of exosome-depleted FBS; the excess staining was removed by adding 10 mL of PBS followed by ultracentrifugation at 37,400 rcf for 30 min with an Ultracentrifuge Optima L-70 (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, California, USA), type 70 Ti rotor. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 200 µL PBS. The same procedure was performed staining PBS as negative control. Human dermal fibroblasts were seeded on 13 mm Ø glass slides and treated for 24 h with the PKH26-stained EVs. Slides were fixed with PFA 4%, blocked with BSA 1%, and incubated with Hoechst fluorescent dye (Sigma-Aldrich) to stain cell nuclei and Alexa Fluor™ 488 Phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) to stain actin filaments. Images were acquired with the Zeiss Axiovert 200 M Fluorescence Microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 63x oil objective.

Proteomic sample preparation and analysis of EVs followed established protocols. Protein digestion and clean-up were conducted as described earlier [42]. The proteomic profiling was performed using an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system coupled to an Orbitrap Lumos tribrid mass spectrometer, both from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The fragmentation analysis was based on higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27. Fragment ion spectra were interpreted by Proteome Discoverer v2.5 employing the SEQUEST HT algorithm, which uses cross-correlation scoring (XCorr) and deltaCn values to assign peptide sequences from MS/MS spectra. The algorithm integrates with retention time alignment and dynamic exclusion features of the LC-MS system. While the fragmentation approach itself is not exclusive to nanoLC, the high-resolution gradient separation obtained via nanoLC enhances peptide identification confidence and spectral quality. Thus, the observed fragmentation patterns are indirectly influenced by LC conditions, particularly peptide elution behavior and peak sharpness. Peptides were trapped using a PepMap trap-cartridge and separated on a C18 reversed-phase column with a 90-minute linear gradient. The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis employed a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) approach, with a mass range of 400–1500 m/z, using HCD fragmentation at 27 normalized collision energy. The resolution was set to 120,000 for MS1 and 15,000 for MS/MS scans. Peptides with single or unassigned charges were excluded, and a quadrupole isolation width of 1.6 Da was used. Data analysis was performed in Proteome Discoverer v2.5, applying search parameters including trypsin as the enzyme, a maximum of one missed cleavage, and mass tolerances of 10 ppm for precursors and 0.6 Da for fragments. Proteins were identified based on at least one unique peptide, with a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.1. All analyses were carried out in triplicate. Pathway enrichment of the proteomic data was conducted using the STRING database (https://string-db.org/). Protein identifiers were entered, and the analysis was focused on Homo sapiens, with k-means clustering (k = 8) applied to organize functional protein networks. Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms for biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions were prioritized. Visualization and data integration were done using the STRING database and SR plot web server (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/srplot).

The intracellular calcium indicator Fura-2 AM was used to ratiometrically evaluate the change of intracellular Ca2+levels upon EV stimulation. Fibroblasts were grown on 24 mm Ø cover glasses and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer modified buffer (KRB: 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1mM Na3PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 5.5mM glucose, and 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2or 100 µM EGTA, supplemented with 2.5 mM Fura-2 AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.02% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1 mM sulfinpyrazone (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed and the saline was replaced accordingly. Next, the cells were placed in an open Leyden chamber on a 37 °C thermostated stage and exposed to 340/380 wavelength light using the Olympus xcellence (Olympus, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) multiple wavelength high-resolution fluorescence microscopy system equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and a 40x UPLXAPO40XO oil immersion objective (n.a. 1.4) to determine the cytosolic Ca2+response.

To test mitochondrial Ca2+levels, fibroblasts were grown on 24 mm Ø coverslips and transfected with a last generation mitochondrial mt-GCaMP6-encoding plasmid. Calcium Imaging was performed on Olympus excellence multiple wavelength high-resolution fluorescence microscopy system. Cells were alternatively illuminated at 474 and 410 nm and fluorescence was collected through a 515/30‐nm band‐pass filter. Exposure time was set to 200 ms at 474 nm and to 400 ms at 410 nm, to account for the low quantum yield at the latter wavelength. Images were analyzed with ImageJ software.

Fibroblasts were grown on 24 mm Ø cover glasses and treated for 48 h with 1 mg/mL aMAT-EVs. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB/Ca2+saline supplemented with 2 nM Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10 µM Verapamil (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C for 30 min. After 60 s of baseline recording, fibroblasts were stimulated with 1 µM carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to dissipate ΔΨm. Measurements were performed by using the Olympus xcellence workstation equipped with an Olympus 40x UPLXAPO40XO oil immersion objective (n.a. 1.4) and a temperature-controlled stage set at 37 °C. Images were analysed with ImageJ software.

DS16570511, mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex inhibitor: fibroblasts were treated with 3 µM DS16570511 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 48 h at 37 °C in cell culture medium supplemented with exosome-depleted Fetal Bovine Serum; in case of EV-treated specimens, DS16570511 was added 10 min before the EVs.

MCU-i11, MCU complex inhibitor: fibroblasts were treated with 10 µM MCU-i11 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 48 h at 37 °C in cell culture medium supplemented with exosome-depleted Fetal Bovine Serum; in case of EV-treated specimens, MCU-i11 was added 10 min before the EVs.

Ruthenium Red (RR), Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cation channels inhibitor: fibroblasts were treated with 10 µM Ruthenium Red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 37 °C in KRB/Ca2+saline; the protocol by Trollinger and colleagues was adapted [43].

Data are expressed as a means, with an indication of the standard error of the mean (SEM) obtained from at least three independent replicas of the experiment. The significant difference between conditions was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons by post hoc Bonferroni test with the GraphPad Prism software.

Established techniques were utilized to create stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that expressed KOP receptors and stably expressed the Gαqi5protein and fibroblast (Sigma) [44]. These cells were sustained in a culture medium consisting of DMEM and Ham F-12 (mixed at a 1:1 ratio) along with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 µg/ mL), and fungizone (2.5 µg/ mL). Additional supplements of geneticin (G418, 200 µg/ml) and hygromycin B (200 µg/ mL) were added to stock cultures.

For transfection studies, CHO cells were seeded onto glass coverslips of varying dimensions, depending on the specific assay: 13 mm diameter for aequorin experiments and 24 mm diameter for Fura-2/AM measurements. Prior to transfection, cells were allowed to reach 50% confluence and then subjected to a standard Ca2+-phosphate procedure. All experiments were conducted for 36 h of post-transfection.

Aequorin assessments were carried out to gauge mitochondrial calcium concentrations through established methodologies (Pinton P et al., Methods Cell Biol, 2007). Initially, cells were seeded onto 13-mm glass coverslips and allowed to reach 75% confluence. Then, 4 µg of mitochondrial-targeted aequorin was transfected into the cells. After 36 h of transfection, cells were cultured for 2 h at 37 °C in Krebs–Ringer modified buffer (KRB) supplemented with 5 µM coelenterazine to activate the aequorin. Following this, measurements were taken using an automated luminometer (MicrobetaJET, PerkinElmer, CA, USA). KRB containing various concentrations of HA was injected, and luminescence was recorded for 60 s. To conclude the experiments and normalize the acquired values, a hypotonic solution containing 500 µM digitonin and 50 mM CaCl2was introduced to discharge the remaining aequorin. The results were presented as % of probe discharged ± standard error (SE). This computation is possible because aequorin undergoes an irreversible reaction upon binding to three high-affinity sites (EF-hand type), emitting a photon and deactivating the protein (discharged). To translate the aequorin luminescence data into [Ca2+] values, a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+response curve of aequorins was utilized, as previously outlined [45]. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide.

A prospective, single-center, non-comparative study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of institutional and national legislation and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on human experimentation. All the participants signed informed consent, and the present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Marche Region (protocol n. 154/2021). TMJ OA was defined according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for clinical hand OA [46] or as the presence of structural abnormalities. Between 2020 and 2022, patients were consecutively enrolled if they were diagnosed with TMJ OA that not requiring surgical treatment and provided written informed consent.

Patients were consecutively enrolled if they met the following inclusion criteria: (i) age between 45 and 70 years, (ii) diagnosis of TMC OA, Eaton-Littler stage II, confirmed radiographically, (iii) persistent pain and functional limitation, (iv) failure of at least 6 months of conservative treatment (including physical therapy and NSAIDs), and (v) ability to provide written informed consent.

Exclusion criteria included: (1) Previous intra-articular injection of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid within the last 6 months, (2) Prior surgery on the affected TMC joint, (3) Uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., poorly managed diabetes, active cancer), (4) Autoimmune or inflammatory rheumatic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus erythematous), (5) Neurological or orthopedic comorbidities affecting hand function (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, adjacent tendinopathies). Patient demographic characteristics are summarized as follows: The mean age was 59.3 ± 6.4 years; 17 patients were female and 8 male. The mean BMI was 26.1 ± 3.2 kg/m2. The most frequent comorbidities included controlled hypertension (32%) and type 2 diabetes (12%). No patients presented with active infection, severe obesity (BMI > 35), or recent trauma to the affected hand.

Each patient received an autologous intra-articular injection of aMAT, processed from their own lipoaspirate under sterile conditions using the Rigenera®system. Before injecting, the skin was sterilely dressed, and the injection of 2–3 mL of aMAT was performed into TMC joint with a superolateral approach, under fluoroscopic X-ray guidance and using a disposable 20G needle and a 3 mL Luer-Lock Syringe. After application of dressings, a plaster cast was applied for 14 days. Patients were advised not use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs following the procedure. Otherwise, mild activities and a gradual resumption of daily activity were allowed directly after splint removal. All patients followed the same standardized rehabilitation protocol.

Anterior–posterior, lateral and oblique radiographic views of the thumb aid in confirming the diagnosis [47]. Findings consistent with OA include narrowing of the joint space and osteophytes, in addition to subchondral sclerosis and cysts, which can be used to stage disease using the Eaton and Littler classification [48].

At the end of the surgical procedure and prior to discharge, all patients were evaluated for wound condition and fitted with a custom-made thermoplastic splint immobilizing the first TMC joint. This rigid immobilization was maintained for 2 weeks. Afterwards, patients transitioned to a soft neoprene splint, which was worn during daytime activities for an additional 4 weeks. Rehabilitation began after the initial 2-week immobilization period, at the time of transition to the neoprene splint. The program included passive mobilization exercises followed by active-assisted range of motion and progressive grip strengthening. Rehabilitation was standardized and supervised by certified hand therapists, with two in-clinic sessions per week for 6 weeks, along with a prescribed home exercise regimen. Exercises included thumb circumduction, opposition drills, and resistance training using therapy putty and elastic bands. Patients were instructed to avoid NSAIDs for 12 weeks following the procedure to enable an accurate assessment of pain-related outcome measures. Adherence to the rehabilitation protocol was verified at each follow-up visit. Clinical follow-up appointments were scheduled at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-intervention. At each visit, patients were systematically assessed for clinical status, functional outcomes, and any potential adverse events.

Outcomes were evaluated by two different members of the clinical team to minimize assessment bias: preoperative assessments and the surgical procedure were conducted by one surgeon, while postoperative evaluations were performed by a different clinician who was not involved in the treatment phase. Validated clinical tools and objective tests (e.g., MHQ, Kapandji score, dynamometry) were used to ensure reproducibility and minimize subjectivity. Patient-reported outcomes included: (i) The numeric rating score (NRS) for pain has been widely used to evaluate clinical pain intensity [49]. Joint pain intensity is assessed on a 100-mm score at baseline, after 6 and 12 months of follow up, where 0 indicates no pain and 100 indicates extreme pain; (ii) The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) is a validated patient-rated questionnaire, which means the patients evaluate their hand health state [50], where the major items include six categories (satisfaction, pain, work, daily living, aesthetics, function). The MHQ score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better hand function. Active flexion and extension of the TMC joint were measured with a goniometer and the total range of motion (ROM) was calculated, together with Kapandji opposition score. Measure of maximum grip strength was done in a standardized sitting position using a Jamar dynamoter for assessment of lateral, tip and palmar pinch test.

Patient safety was systematically assessed at each follow-up visit (6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-procedure). Evaluations included clinical examinations, patient-reported symptoms, and specific screening for potential adverse events such as infection, joint effusion, persistent or worsening pain, and neurological deficits. No adverse events were observed in any patient during the 12-month follow-up period.

Continuous variables were reported as either means and standard deviation or median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) according to their distribution, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Categorical variables were reported as absolute frequencies and percentages. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) were performed to estimate the covariates longitudinal effect on strength assessment with Tripod, Key, Tip test, and NRS. Mixed effects regression model uses all available data and can properly account for correlation between repeated measures. The covariates included in the model were group-status (i.e., treated and controlateral groups) and time-points as categorical variable and their interaction. To minimize the risk of type I error due to multiple comparisons, repeated-measures ANOVA models and LMM were followed by Bonferroni or Tukey post hoc correction where appropriate. For groups effect testing, the Tukey post-hoc test was performed. For NRS on activity, Thumb Opposition (i.e., Kapandji score), and MHQ scores, repeated measures ANOVA model was performed with p-value adjusted by Bonferroni approach. All p-values were interpreted in the context of these corrections.

aMAT-EVs were isolated through the ultrafiltration technique. The integrity and purity of the EV preparation were assessed through post-isolation analyses including tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and specific protein marker detection (Fig.1). The mean diameter measured by TRPS was 113 ± 51 nm (Fig.1a), and the mean protein concentration measured by BCA assay was 1115.37 ± 229.10 µg/mL (Fig.1b). A semi-quantitative exosome antibody array was performed to profile the internal and surface proteins in aMAT-EVs (Fig.1c).

EVs were positive for programmed cell death 6 interacting protein (ALIX), tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), and annexin A5 (ANXA5). A weaker signal was detected for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), flotillin 1 (FLOT1), CD63, and CD81. aMAT-EVs were negative for cis-Golgi matrix protein (GM130), the cellular protein contamination marker. The positivity for established exosomal markers CD63 and CD81 was confirmed by bead-based flow cytometry assay (Fig.1d, e,f). aMAT-EVs collected using anti-CD63 (Fig.1d) or anti-CD81 (Fig.1e) coated magnetic beads were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD63 or anti-CD81, respectively. In Fig.1f, magnetic beads coated with anti-CD81 were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD63 to detect double positivity to both markers. TEM images revealed nanometer-sized particles with cup-like shape (Fig.1g). The internalization of aMAT-EVs into target cells was demonstrated through fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescent red spots appeared inside fibroblasts after incubation with PKH26-stained aMAT-EVs for 48 h. In contrast, incubation with negative control (PKH26-stained PBS) did not show this phenomenon (Fig.1h). Overall, these results demonstrate that EVs isolated from aMAT have characteristics compatible with small EVs, also called exosomes. In fact, they shown the typical range in size from 30 to 150 nm, along with the cup-shaped morphology observed under TEM and the expression of typical internal and surface proteins.

Proteomic analysis was performed to evaluate the protein cargo of aMAT-EVs. 1246 proteins belonging toHomo sapiensand 10,097 predicted protein interactions were identified in the aMAT-EV samples through the STRING software (https://string-db.org/).Pathway enrichment analysis of the proteomic results was performed to determine protein involvement in the gene ontology domains biological pathway (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC) (BP ≥ 0.43, MF ≥ 0.49, CC ≥ 0.55) (Fig.S1a).

BP analysis highlighted that the most noteworthy nodes are “Chronic inflammatory response” (GO:0002544), “Epithelial cell-cell adhesion” (GO:0090136), “Collagen fibril organization” (GO:0030199), “Extracellular matrix organization” (GO:0030198), “Regulation of wound healing” (GO:0061041). 8 clusters are obtained with the “Clusters” function and k-means = 8 in STRING The first cluster outnumbers the others and almost coincides in number of nodes (1130 out of 1246 proteins); it is to be noted that 100% of the BPs found via the enrichment analysis are part of the main cluster as showed in Fig.S1(b, c, d).

CC enrichment located most proteins in the collagen domain – for instance, “Collagen type XI trimer” (GO:0005592), “Fibrillar collagen trimer” (GO:0005583) and “Complex of collagen trimers” (GO:0098644).

MF enrichment arranged 61 functions, with the most interesting ones being “Structural molecule activity conferring elasticity” (GO:0097493), “Collagen binding” (GO:0005518), “Extracellular matrix structural constituent” (GO:0005201) and “Antioxidant activity” (GO:0016209).

We investigated whether aMAT-EVs elicit alterations in intracellular Ca2+fluxes on recipient fibroblasts. The concentration of Ca2+was measured in the cytosol of fibroblasts loaded with the ratiometric Ca2+indicator Fura-2 AM in a Ca2+-enriched KRB saline. Upon EV stimulation, an increase in Fura-2 AM ratio was recorded, indicating that EVs induce a transient elevation in the concentration of Ca2+in the cytoplasm ([Ca2+]c) (Fig.2a, b). The positive and negative response rates of fibroblasts to EV treatment are 63.4% and 36.6% respectively (Fig.2c).

To determine whether calcium perturbation depended on intracellular reservoirs or extracellular influxes, we stimulated fibroblasts with aMAT-EVs in Ca2+-free KRB media enriched with the Ca2+chelator EGTA. Under these conditions, aMAT-EV stimulation led to minimal or no variations in the Fura-2 AM ratio compared to fibroblasts maintained in KRB/Ca2+saline (Fig.2d). The Area Under Curve (AUC) analysis of fibroblasts in KRB/EGTA saline showed a significant reduction compared to those in KRB/Ca2+saline (Fig.2e).

Various channels facilitate rapid Ca2+flux from the extracellular milieu. We focused on the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels, a family that includes channels permeable to both monovalent ions (e.g., Na+, K+) and divalent ions (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+). These channels can act as sensors for a variety of cellular and environmental signals [51]. Notably, certain TRP channel members are known to open in response to different extracellular matrix components [52]. Since our proteomic analysis identified extracellular matrix components within aMAT-EVs, we speculated that TRP channels might mediate the perturbation of Ca2+homeostasis.

To test this hypothesis, we used the low-specificity inhibitor Ruthenium Red (RR) to block TRP channels. Fibroblasts were pretreated with 10 µM RR for 20 min before recording Ca2+signals [53]. Upon aMAT-EV stimulation, fibroblasts exposed to RR showed no perturbation of [Ca2+]c, unlike cells treated with the vehicle (Fig.2f). The AUC analysis of fibroblast pretreated with RR showed a significant decrease (Fig.2g).

Perturbations in [Ca2+]care often linked to mitochondrial Ca2+uptake. To verify this hypothesis, fibroblasts were transfected with the ratiometric GFP-based indicator 2mt-GCaMP6s. Upon aMAT-EV stimulation, an increase in the 2mt-GCaMP6s ratio was observed, indicating a transient accumulation of Ca2+in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig.2h and i).

Mitochondrial Ca2+perturbations are usually linked to changes in the mitochondrial physiology, including stimulation of tricarboxylic cycle and mitochondrial respiration [54]. We utilized mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) as a readout of mitochondrial respiration after Adipose tissue-EV stimulation. Fibroblasts were treated with aMAT-EVs for 48 h and then incubated with the potentiometric dye TMRM. To ensure that aspecific accumulation of TMRM was not accounted in the measurement, cells were stimulated with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, to allow the release of only mitochondrial TMRM. The difference in signal before and after FCCP administration, accounted as readout of ΔΨm, resulted significantly more elevated in EV-treated fibroblasts (Fig.3a, b).

The elevation of ΔΨm suggests an elevation of mitochondrial respiration. To confirm this hypothesis, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured in fibroblasts treated with aMAT-EVs or vehicles. No effect was observed on basal respiration or respiration related to ATP production (Fig.3d, e), nonetheless the maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity resulted significantly elevated in cells exposed to EV compared to cells (Fig.3f, g).

To understand if the alteration of mitochondrial bioenergetics was dependent on mitochondrial Ca2+uptake, fibroblasts were pretreated with two different inhibitors of the MCU (DS16570511 and MCU-i11) before exposure to aMAT-EVs, then ΔΨm was measured. We observed that both inhibitors prevented the elevation of ΔΨm after 48 h of exposure to aMAT-EVs (Fig.3h, i).

EVs have frequently been associated with the modulation of responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, various perturbations in mitochondrial physiology have been reported as pivotal in the inflammatory response and the propagation of an inflammatory state [55,56]. To mimic an inflammatory condition, fibroblasts were treated with 10 ng/mL TNFα for 24 h, after which [Ca2+]clevels were measured. EV stimulation elicited a transient increase in [Ca2+]cin vehicle-treated fibroblasts. Interestingly, the Ca2+mobilization induced by aMAT-EVs was significantly stronger in fibroblasts pretreated with TNFα (Fig.4a, c). Exposure to TNFα induced a reduction in ΔΨm in fibroblasts, as confirmed by multiple reports in other cell models [57–59]. Remarkably, administration of aMAT-EVs to TNFα-treated fibroblasts was able to restore ΔΨm to levels comparable to those of untreated fibroblasts (Fig.4b).

The aim of this technology is to evaluate whether SF exosomes can reduce pain by affecting nociceptors. It is evident that the selective binding of agonists, such as nociceptin, to their respective receptors leads to a significant increase in mitochondrial calcium levels (Fig.4d). This effect is notably absent in the negative control group, which lacks agonistic stimulation.

Delving further into the experimental investigation, the same cell models were exposed to a substance designated as aMAT-EV and hyaluronic acid, applied in a wide range of concentrations from 0.005 to 5 mg/mL. Interestingly, low molecular weight hyaluronic acid did not induce any noticeable increase in luminescence. In contrast, high molecular weight hyaluronic acid elicited a significant luminescent response in CHO cells expressing KOP receptors (Fig.4d). The maximal effect of hyaluronic acid was approximately half that of the robust response induced by dynorphin A, suggesting partial agonism at KOP receptors. Notably, aMAT-EVs also demonstrated the ability to activate receptors, as clearly observed in the experiments.

To explore the potential interplay between genomic markers and fragmentomic data, we analyzed whether characteristic features of EV cargo could be aligned with known pain- and inflammation-related genetic targets. Proteomic clustering highlighted a subset of EV-contained proteins involved in mitochondrial function, calcium homeostasis, and extracellular matrix remodeling—domains often regulated by genes such as MT-ND1, IL6, TNFA, and COL1A1. These markers are frequently altered in OA and inflammatory pain conditions. While our current dataset focuses on the proteomic and functional content of EVs, the structural properties of the vesicles (e.g., size range, surface markers, internalization efficiency) were consistent with fragmentomic patterns known to influence uptake and signaling efficiency. Thus, we propose that combining genomic profiles (e.g., gene expression or SNPs from synovial or circulating cells) with the functional fragmentomic signatures of EVs could pave the way for personalized stratification of OA patients and optimization of EV-based therapeutic strategies.

Twenty-five participants were enrolled in the study. We enrolled 25 patients with symptomatically and radiographically diagnosed TMC OA joints (Grade II Eaton classification). All patients had unilateral involvement, while patients with bilateral involvement were excluded from the study. The mean age was 56.2 years (range 45–70 years, SD 8.71). 60% of the participants were male and 40% were male. Eighteen were dominant right hand. Patients were monitored according to our follow-up schedule. No patient reported worsening of symptoms.

There were no postoperative complications, no infections, and no significant adverse reactions or side effects. All patients were assessed at regular intervals (Table1). Results at 12 months postoperatively were used to assess the efficacy of the procedure (Fig.5).

The exercise routine can now be progressively intensified in order to fully utilize the thumb.

Strength assessed with Tripod, Key and Tip pinch test. Tripod pinch test assessed a significant improvement from 6.152 Kg (SD 0.81) to 8.588 (SD 1.59) after 6 months (p< 0.001) and to 9.688 (SD 1.92) after 12 months (p< 0.001) (Fig.6a). Compared to the contralateral healthy hand, tripod pinch test showed no significant differences 6 months (p= 0.20) and 12 months (p= 0.5) after treatment (Fig.6b). Key pinch test assessed a significant improvement from 7.02 Kg (SD 1.38) to 8.66 (SD 2) after 6 months (p< 0.001) and to 9.28 (SD 1.61) after 12 months (p< 0.001) (Fig.6c). Compared to the contralateral healthy hand, key pinch test showed no significant differences between 6 months (p= 0.87) and 12 months (p= 0.22) after treatment (Fig.6d). Tip pinch test assessed a significant improvement from 4.68 Kg (SD 0.63) to 6.06 (SD 0.68) after 6 months (p< 0.001) and to 6.99 (SD 0.81) after 12 months (p< 0.001) (Fig.6e). Compared to the contralateral healthy hand, tip pinch test showed no significant differences 6 months (p= 0.77) and 12 months (p= 0.002) after treatment (Fig.6f).

The comparative evaluation of strength compared to the contralateral hand is strongly limited and influenced by the patient’s dominance, as the dominant hand tends to be naturally stronger and more coordinated than the non-dominant hand.

An improvement in pain both at rest and after activity was seen. NRS at rest preoperatively was 55.16 ± 16.02 improving to 34.73 ± 15.57 after 6 months (p< 0.0001) and 14.73 ± 13.46 after 12 months (p< 0.0001). NRS on activity preoperatively was 80.78 ± 11.4 improving to 63.09 ± 12.35 after 6 months (p< 0.0001) and 23.47 ± 10.89 after 12 months (p< 0.0001) (Figs.6g and h and7c).

Kapandji score improved significantly from 6.56/10 (SD 0.89) preoperatively to 7.12/10 (SD 0.58) at 6 months post treatment and 8.44/10 (SD 0.49) at 12 months post treatment (Fig.7a).

Compared to baseline (84.76 ± 4.63), MHQ scores were significantly higher at six months (90.86 ± 2.94) (p< 0.0001) and twelve months (98.14 ± 1.97) (p< 0.0001), indicating improvement (Fig.7b).

All patients who had an X-ray 12 months postoperatively were still classified at the same Dell stage and therefore did not show any obvious worsening.

Until now, research on MSC-derived extracellular vesicles has primarily focused on their molecular content and regenerative potential [60,61]. However, the cellular mechanisms they trigger upon interaction with recipient cells remain largely unexplored. In this study, aMAT-EVs were isolated and characterized according to MISEV guidelines. Size analysis using tunable resistive pulse sensing and TEM imaging confirmed their nanometric dimensions and typical cup-shaped morphology. Key exosomal markers (ALIX, TSG101, ANXA5, CD81, and CD63) were detected using immunoblotting and flow cytometry. Proteomic analysis revealed proteins linked to extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, collagen fibril formation, wound healing, and inflammation regulation—hallmarks of regenerative activity [41,62]. Although chondrocytes are commonly studied in the context of OA, we selected fibroblasts for in vitro investigation based on their active involvement in periarticular remodeling, matrix turnover, and inflammatory signaling within the osteoarthritic joint. Fibroblasts represent a reproducible and well-characterized model and are key contributors to tissue homeostasis and degeneration in the context of thumb carpometacarpal OA, where multiple periarticular structures are affected. GO enrichment analysis of EV proteomics indicated the presence of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, extracellular matrix organization, and calcium-dependent signaling cascades. Calcium signaling was selected as a focal pathway based on its central role in mitochondrial regulation, cellular metabolism, and the activation of stress and inflammatory responses. The observed modulation of intracellular Ca2+dynamics in fibroblasts supports the hypothesis that aMAT-derived EVs may exert their therapeutic effects by restoring cellular homeostasis and dampening pro-inflammatory signaling in target stromal cells.

To explore their effects on recipient cells, aMAT-EVs were shown to be internalized by human dermal fibroblasts within 24 h, as evidenced by PKH26 staining. This uptake underscores their potential for therapeutic delivery and intercellular communication. The study also revealed that aMAT-EVs trigger intracellular calcium signaling in fibroblasts, a critical pathway for cellular responses. Using Fura-2 AM, a significant rise in cytosolic calcium levels was observed upon EV stimulation. Further experiments confirmed that this calcium influx originates from the extracellular space, mediated by TRP channels. Ruthenium Red, a TRP channel inhibitor, effectively blocked the calcium response, highlighting the role of mechanical activation in this process. Mitochondrial calcium uptake, crucial for cellular bioenergetics, was also evaluated. aMAT-EVs induced transient calcium accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix, enhancing the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and oxygen consumption during maximal respiration. However, inhibiting the MCU did not affect ΔΨm, suggesting an alternate pathway for calcium entry. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of aMAT-EVs was validated in inflamed fibroblasts treated with TNF-α. EV treatment restored ΔΨm to levels comparable to non-inflamed cells, indicating their ability to mitigate inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. This regenerative effect, likely mediated by their anti-inflammatory properties, highlights aMAT-EVs as promising candidates for novel therapies targeting inflammation and oxidative stress-related disorders [63,64]. The mitochondrial improvements observed in EV-treated fibroblasts may have functional relevance in the context of TMC OA. Fibroblasts in osteoarthritic tissues are known to undergo mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and adopt a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype—collectively contributing to matrix degradation and persistent inflammation. By restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and improving bioenergetic capacity, EVs may help reprogram fibroblasts toward a more quiescent and homeostatic state. This process could mitigate senescence-associated secretory activity and the production of catabolic mediators. Prior studies have shown that cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in fibroblasts are closely linked to OA progression and joint pain, particularly through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines [65,66]. Our findings support the hypothesis that the EV-induced modulation of mitochondrial function may represent a key mechanism in alleviating stromal inflammation and tissue degeneration in TMC OA.

This investigation adds further evidence to the concept that mitochondrial modulation plays a pivotal role in the therapeutic potential of EVs. Enhanced ΔΨm and improved mitochondrial respiration upon aMAT-EV stimulation are consistent with increased cellular bioenergetics, which supports tissue regeneration and repair. Furthermore, the ability of aMAT-EVs to restore mitochondrial function in inflamed fibroblasts suggests their dual action in both repairing metabolic dysfunction and mitigating inflammation. These properties are critical for chronic conditions such as OA, where mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory pathways converge to exacerbate joint degeneration.

Lastly, in vitro study was conducted to assess the impact of aMAT-EVs on opioid receptors within an in vitro model. To analyze this, we used CHO cell lines expressing the Gαqi5protein, which couples any G-protein-coupled receptor to an increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]c). The observed Ca2+responses confirmed that aMAT-EVs selectively activates the KOP receptor as a partial agonist, suggesting that the therapeutic effect may be partially mediated by modulation of nociceptive pathways, resulting in reduced pain perception in patients. In vitro results support the efficacy of aMAT-EVs in reducing nociceptive pain through selective KOP receptor activation. Aequorin-based assays were employed, showing a transient increase in mitochondrial Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]m), which is at least one order of magnitude higher than cytosolic levels, upon receptor activation. These findings imply that aMAT-EVs may play a role in pain reduction via specific nociceptive pathways [67,68].

The implications of these findings extend beyond nociceptive modulation. The dual action of aMAT-EVs, combining mitochondrial restoration with KOP receptor activation, introduces a novel paradigm in pain management. Traditional pharmacological interventions for OA and related pain disorders primarily target symptom relief without addressing underlying cellular dysfunctions. The EV-based approach, by contrast, offers a multifaceted mechanism that not only alleviates pain but also promotes cellular homeostasis and repair, which could delay disease progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial function and calcium signaling play a pivotal role in nociceptive modulation. Mitochondrial Ca2+uptake, ROS production, and cross-talk with the endoplasmic reticulum have been shown to influence neuronal excitability and pain sensitivity in both inflammatory and neuropathic contexts [69–71]. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale supporting the analgesic potential of aMAT-EVs, which modulate these same pathways in vitro.

Clinically, patients treated with aMAT demonstrated significant improvement in pain and functional parameters. The MHQ showed a notable improvement (p< 0.0001), particularly in pain relief. NRS scores decreased significantly both at rest and during activity after treatment. At rest, the NRS score dropped from 55.16 to 34.73 after six months and to 14.73 after 12 months (p< 0.0001 for both periods), while activity-related pain scores decreased from 80.78 to 63.09 after six months and to 23.47 after 12 months. These improvements indicate substantial pain relief and functional recovery, with a more pronounced impact on activity-related pain.

Objective measures, including pinch strength and Kapandji opposition score, showed significant improvements from baseline to 6 and 12 months. All three pinch strength tests (Tripod, Key, and Tip) improved, suggesting that aMAT was effective in enhancing hand strength. Comparison with the healthy contralateral hand showed no significant differences in Tripod and Key pinch tests at both follow-up periods, while a significant improvement was observed in the Tip pinch test after 12 months. The Kapandji score also showed a statistically significant increase over time, reflecting enhanced thumb opposition and overall hand functionality. Although no radiographic structural improvements were observed over the 12-month follow-up period, it is important to consider that TMC OA is typically characterized by a progressive course. Therefore, the absence of radiographic deterioration within this timeframe can be regarded as a positive outcome, especially from the perspective of hand surgeons managing this condition. Moreover, the imaging modality employed—standard plain radiographs—may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle tissue-level changes induced by EVs. Future studies incorporating advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide more detailed insights into the microstructural and microenvironmental effects of aMAT- EVs.

Interestingly, these functional improvements align with the observed cellular and molecular changes. The enhanced mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetic state in vitro could underpin the clinical improvements in grip strength and thumb opposition. Such correlations highlight the translational relevance of the findings, suggesting that aMAT-EVs could provide a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and clinical recovery.

No significant radiological changes were observed after one year, although pain reduction was evident, aligning with findings from other studies [72]. However, radiography may be limited in assessing early cartilage and synovial microenvironment changes. As shown by Mayoly et al. [73], pain reduction may correlate more closely with reduced edema in the cartilage and synovium. Future studies employing advanced imaging modalities could provide a clearer view of structural changes associated with pain relief.

Additionally, exploring advanced imaging techniques such as MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) could shed light on EV-induced microenvironmental changes, such as reductions in synovial inflammation or cartilage repair. Such approaches could validate the observed therapeutic benefits at the molecular and structural levels, further reinforcing the clinical utility of aMAT-EVs.

The study highlights the potential of aMAT in managing TMC joint OA, aligning with recent advances in regenerative medicine. However, consistent methodologies for adipose tissue processing and controlled, randomized trials will be essential to confirm the efficacy of this treatment in broader patient populations. From a clinical perspective, the application of aMAT-EVs holds significant translational promise. The use of aMAT processed via a closed, non-enzymatic system (Rigenera®) ensures compliance with current minimal manipulation guidelines and reduces regulatory burdens. Moreover, the intra-articular injection procedure is relatively simple, minimally invasive, and compatible with outpatient settings, making it feasible for routine clinical adoption. This approach could offer a valuable alternative for patients with early to moderate TMC OA who are unresponsive to conservative treatments but not yet eligible for surgical interventions. Standardization of harvesting and processing protocols, along with training of orthopedic and hand specialists, would facilitate integration into current clinical workflows. As the technique avoids enzymatic digestion and cell expansion, it bypasses many of the limitations associated with traditional cell-based therapies, thus accelerating its path toward clinical translation. In this regard, aMAT-EV therapy may represent a valuable intermediary option between conservative care and surgery, filling an important therapeutic gap in the management of degenerative hand conditions.

While the results of this study are promising, several limitations must be acknowledged. The relatively small sample size (n= 25) and single-center design may constrain statistical power and limit generalizability. Nevertheless, the consistent clinical improvements observed across all validated metrics indicate that aMAT-EVs hold substantial therapeutic promise. This study was not designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), but rather as an exploratory, single-arm clinical investigation aimed at evaluating the safety and early clinical efficacy of aMAT-EVs. Given the ethical constraints associated with the use of placebo or sham injections in intra-articular procedures, a control group was not included. While the findings are encouraging, future RCTs with appropriate comparators will be required to confirm and generalize these results.

Additionally, structural changes were assessed exclusively by conventional X-rays, which have limited sensitivity for detecting early tissue-level improvements such as cartilage repair or synovial inflammation. The inclusion of advanced imaging techniques such as MRI or ultrasound in future trials will help to more accurately capture microstructural responses and their correlation with clinical outcomes. Finally, while the in vitro findings provide mechanistic insights into the action of aMAT-EVs, the translation of these molecular and cellular effects to clinical outcomes remains partially speculative. However, even if this study provides converging evidence from in vitro and in vivo data supporting the therapeutic relevance of aMAT-EVs, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects remain incompletely delineated. The modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and calcium signaling in fibroblasts aligns with known pathways involved in cellular stress and inflammation; however, direct causal links between these molecular events and clinical improvements were not established. Further mechanistic studies are needed to dissect the contribution of individual EV cargo molecules—such as specific proteins, miRNAs, or lipids—and their downstream targets in recipient cells. Approaches such as pathway inhibition, gene knockdown, or selective EV subpopulation profiling could help elucidate the key effectors mediating analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions. Further investigations are needed to delineate the precise pathways through which aMAT-EVs exert their regenerative and anti-nociceptive effects, particularly in inflamed and degenerated tissues.

This study demonstrates the potential of aMAT-EVs as a novel, minimally invasive therapeutic strategy for managing TMC OA. While several recent clinical studies have reported the therapeutic effects of aMAT in large-joint OA (e.g., knee or hip OA) [74–76], our study provides novel insights in three key aspects. First, it targets TMC OA, a distinct and under-investigated form of OA with unique anatomical and functional characteristics. Second, it combines clinical outcomes with a mechanistic investigation focused on aMAT-EVs, which have not been explored in previous trials. Third, we demonstrate the impact of these EVs on mitochondrial function and calcium signaling in fibroblasts, supporting a potential cellular mechanism underlying clinical pain relief. This integrative approach strengthens the translational relevance of the findings and highlights the therapeutic potential of EVs as a future standalone option. Through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo analyses, we have shown that aMAT-EVs possess a unique capacity to modulate inflammation, enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics, and influence nociceptive pathways via selective activation of KOP receptors. Clinically, these effects translate into significant reductions in pain and improvements in hand functionality and strength, as evidenced by decreased NRS scores, increased Kapandji opposition scores, and enhanced pinch strength across multiple measures. Importantly, the absence of radiological progression over 12 months suggests that this approach may offer both symptomatic relief and a protective effect against joint deterioration.

The findings provide a promising foundation for the development of EV-based therapies, which could address the unmet clinical needs of patients with OA and related MSD. By targeting both the underlying cellular dysfunctions and the symptomatic burden, aMAT-EVs represent an innovative therapeutic modality with the potential to redefine current treatment paradigms.

While the results of this study are promising, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the sample size of the clinical cohort was relatively small, and the study was conducted at a single center. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader and more diverse patient populations. Future multicenter RCT with larger cohorts is necessary to validate these results and establish robust efficacy and safety profiles.

Second, while significant functional and symptomatic improvements were observed, radiological assessments showed no discernible changes in joint structure over the 12-month period. Advanced imaging modalities such as MRI or PET scans were not employed, which might have provided deeper insights into microenvironmental changes, including cartilage repair or synovial inflammation. Incorporating such techniques in future studies could offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the therapeutic effects of aMAT-EVs.

Finally, while the in vitro findings provide mechanistic insights into the action of aMAT-EVs, the translation of these molecular and cellular effects to clinical outcomes remains partially speculative. Further investigations are needed to delineate the precise pathways through which aMAT-EVs exert their regenerative and anti-nociceptive effects, particularly in inflamed and degenerated tissues. Future research should focus on optimizing EV isolation and characterization methods to enhance reproducibility and scalability for clinical use. Additionally, the long-term effects of aMAT-EV therapy on joint health, as well as its potential applications in other chronic pain and degenerative conditions, warrant exploration. The integration of advanced omics technologies and imaging tools will be critical for unraveling the full therapeutic potential of aMAT-EVs and refining their application in personalized medicine.
