Systemic therapies, including relational, couple, marriage, and family therapy services, play a key role in supporting transgender and nonbinary people who experience mental health and relational challenges. However, limited research studies have examined this population's barriers to accessing these therapy services. This study aimed to explore these barriers to enhance the cultural competence of relational and family therapists. This study involved 12 TNB adult participants in Canada. Regarding methodology, the semi‐structured interviews were conducted via Zoom and recorded, and the interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied. The results included the following: (1) Challenges in finding competent and affirming therapists; (2) Geographic limitations; (3) Financial concerns; and (4) Systemic and institutional barriers to accessing RCMFT services. The results can be shared in teaching, supervision, workshops, and conference presentations to improve cultural competence and reduce the barriers.

The mental health challenges experienced by transgender and nonbinary (TNB) individuals have been extensively documented in recent research studies, revealing both the severity of issues such as suicidal ideation and attempts and the complex interplay of minority stress factors (Abramovich et al.2023; Adams et al.2017; Gosling et al.2022; Lucas et al.2024). For instance, Adams et al. (2017) demonstrated that transgender adults were 14 times more likely to report suicidal ideation and 22 times more likely to have attempted suicide compared to the general population. Lucas et al. (2024) highlighted that TNB youth encountered higher rates of mental health struggles alongside diminished support and resiliency compared to their cisgender peers. Moreover, Gosling et al. (2022) revealed the minority stress of transgender and gender nonconforming adults, including external factors (e.g., victimization and inadequate health care experiences) and internal factors (e.g., expectations of prejudice and internalized transphobia), and noted the dilemma created by the experience of seeking mental health services that further perpetuated harm.

It is well documented that TNB people experience additional strain within family and romantic relationships (Budge et al.2023; Charter et al.2021; Coburn et al.2022; Gosling et al.2022; Lucas et al.2024; Munroe et al.2020; Siboni et al.2022; Tyler et al.2024; van Douaa et al.2017; Veale et al.2017). Familial dynamics may hinder the expression of affirmed gender, such as when family members avoid discussions about transitioning or resist acknowledging gender identity (van Douaa et al.2017). Partners of TNB individuals may also struggle with intimacy, resulting in emotional disconnection or misunderstanding, when TNB individuals are navigating body dysphoria or identity‐related changes (Siboni et al.2022). Despite these challenges, several studies emphasize the crucial role of supportive family, romantic, and community networks. For instance, Veale et al. (2017) and Munroe et al. (2020) found that family, peer, and school‐based support contributed significantly to TNB youth mental health. Similarly, Coburn et al. (2022) and Siboni et al. (2022) reported that strong relational and community ties enhanced psychological well‐being. These findings suggest that family and romantic relationships can function as both sources of distress and critical support, underscoring the potential value of relational, couple, marriage, and family therapy in addressing the intertwined mental health and relational needs of TNB people.

Further, it is meaningful to explore the barriers to accessing relational, couple, marriage, or family therapy among TNB people. Recent studies on barriers to therapy for TNB people included four main areas. First, studies emphasized the impacts of cost and insurance coverage issues (Beauregard et al.2017; Holt et al.2023). Beauregard et al. (2017) highlighted that the financial barrier could have forced some TNB people to seek therapy at free or low cost from mental health providers who were not trained to provide transgender‐affirmative mental health services.

Second, studies addressed the impact of gender repairing and gate‐keeping on TNB people when accessing therapy (Anzani et al.2019; Gosling et al.2022; Mizock and Lundquist2016; Soled et al.2022). Some participants reported that their psychotherapists treated their transgender identity as a pathology and focused on treating it, while gender corrective therapy had been found unethical and detrimental to participants’ mental health (Mizock and Lundquist2016). Some participants had negative experiences with their therapists, experiencing them as gatekeepers who overfocused on controlling access to gender‐affirming care or medical resources in jurisdictions that required documentation, which evaluated the mental stability of the client and the authenticity of the client's gender identity (Mizock and Lundquist2016; Soled et al.2022). Anzani et al. (2019) noted that there was a dilemma for TNB clients who often had to complete mental health assessments for medical transitions while also experiencing higher rates of mental health distress due to the impacts of oppression. For many TNB clients, previous experiences of harm relating to gatekeeping could have created additional mental health impacts and could have kept clients from seeking help from mental health care providers, whom they often perceived as a likely source of harm (Gosling et al.2022).

Third, studies identified a barrier related to TNB people's experiences of oppressive, discriminatory, and harmful behaviors by care providers (Amarante et al.2024; Dalton et al.2020; Hunsicker et al.2024; Maoto and Davis2024; McCullough et al.2017; Mizock and Lundquist2016). For example, TTNB clients often reported experiences of being misgendered or “dead named” while in the waiting room for their appointment by administrative workers and in therapy by therapists (Mizock and Lundquist2016). Dalton et al. (2020) noted that ongoing experiences of discrimination and microaggressions from care providers could have impacted TNB people's motivation to seek therapeutic support.

Lastly, studies noted that some therapists did not apply cultural and linguistic skills and cultural humility in working with TNB clients (Dalton et al.2020; McCullough et al.2017; Mizock and Lundquist2016; Snow et al.2019). Mizock and Lundquist (2016) referred to this barrier as gender inflation, gender narrowing, and gender avoidance. Gender inflation refers to therapists over‐focusing on gender identity as the cause of mental or relational distress (Mizock and Lundquist2016). Gender narrowing refers to therapists who are unable to make connections between the client's struggle and their relationship to their gender (Mizock and Lundquist2016). Gender avoidance referred to the clinical dynamic where therapists avoided engaging with the client's gender identity at all (Mizock and Lundquist2016). McCullough et al. (2017) found that TNB clients reported this struggle with under‐ or over‐engagement with gender identity about the presenting problem.

Although studies were exploring the barriers to accessing therapy among TNB people, the vast majority of them focused on the experiences of TNB people seeking medical care or individual therapy or on the perspective of therapists working with TNB clients. Moreover, relevant studies in Canada were lacking. Within a broader socio‐political landscape in Canada, pervasive cissexism and cisnormativity created a constant state of minority stress for TNB individuals. For example, CBC News (2023) reported that the Alberta Human Rights Tribunal dismissed a trans woman's discrimination complaint against Edmonton Public Schools, which highlights systemic biases and discrimination toward TNB people. Unlike individual therapy, systemic therapy invites multiple people into the same therapy room, often including family members or partners who may not affirm the client's gender identity. This may expose TNB clients to misgendering, invalidation, or even hostility. The presence of unsupportive others may limit the TNB's safety and may also challenge the therapist's ability to navigate competing narratives and power dynamics. The relational complexities emphasize the need to explore how TNB clients experience and navigate access to systemic therapy.

The present study aimed to explore the barriers TNB adults in Canada encountered when seeking systemic therapy services. Specifically, the study addressed the research question: “What were the barriers faced by TNB clients in accessing systemic therapy services?” These preliminary insights could have contributed to narrowing the existing gap in the literature and could have offered a foundation for developing culturally sensitive practices among educators, clinicians, and service providers involved in relational, couple, marriage, and family therapy in Canada.

Three theoretical frameworks have been applied in the present study. First, Decolonizing Research challenges dominant epistemologies in mental health by centering historically marginalized perspectives (Thambinathan and Kinsella2021). This framework helps challenge dominant epistemologies and brings attention to the power structures that have historically marginalized nondominant narratives in mental health services. The second framework is Queer Theory, which questions heteronormative and cisnormative perspectives in existing mental health services (Wozolek2019). Using Queer Theory, the study challenges normative gender assumptions and reveals how they influence therapy in ways that harm TNB clients. The third theoretical framework is User Experience, which emphasizes the users’ direct encounters with healthcare services and provides suggestions for improvement (Lesselroth et al.2020). Grounded in TNB individuals’ lived experiences, this framework guides the methodology to keep the research design, data collection, and interpretation rooted in their real‐world service experiences. Together, these frameworks enable the study to center TNB voices, interrogate normative assumptions in therapy settings, surface systemic power imbalances, guide the methodology in exploring the multifaceted barriers TNB individuals face, and support the identification of key areas for improving culturally competent therapeutic practices.

The present study was part of a larger project exploring the barriers to accessing therapies, their presenting issues, and the suggested interventions in the relational, couple, marriage, and family therapy (RCMFT) services for Two‐Spirit, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and other sexual and gender minorities (2SLGBTQ + ) in Canada. Following the approval of the University Human Research Ethics Board at the University of Winnipeg, we were recruiting research participants who identified as members of 2SLGBTQ + , were adults aged 18–64, had experienced at least one RCMFT session, had been living in Canada for over a year, were fluent in English, and had access to a device that can connect to the internet as the eligibility criteria. A phenomenological research approach, one of the qualitative research methods, was adopted to deeply explore the participants’ lived experiences in a particular situation (Ravitch and Carl2019).

To recruit the participants for the present study, the research team utilized community‐based advertising and snowball sampling by sharing an online post, which included the eligibility criteria and a Qualtrics link with a screening survey, with 2SLGBTQ + ‐related communities and organizations from all regions of Canada, such as, Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre, OUTSaskatoon, Calgary Outlink, Pride Centre of Edmonton, Qmunity, David Kelley Services, and Health Initiative for Men, between January 2024 and June 2024. The recruitment poster also provided the first author's contact information and information about the honoraria (each participant would get a $50 CAD e‐gift card after they finished the interview). The interested TNB adults completed the screening survey. The first author verified the geolocation of their IP addresses, which were provided via Qualtrics, to ensure they were from the regions in Canada they indicated. If the candidates appeared eligible, the research team contacted the candidates via email and completed a consent form. Interviews were conducted via Zoom, recorded with participant consent, and transcribed verbatim. For the present study, the interview questions focused on the TNB participants’ barriers to accessing RCMFT services. The interview guide was used, and the major interview questions for the present study included “What kind of practical barriers have you experienced?,” “What kind of psychological barriers have you experienced?” and “What kind of relational barriers have you experienced?.” When needed, the following questions were asked. The first, third, and fourth authors were the interviewers. The 12 semi‐structured interviews were recorded via Zoom. The interviews were transcribed by the first author into Word documents. The first author stored the interview recordings and transcripts in encrypted, password‐protected digital media to protect their confidentiality. This present study involved 12 TNB participants who were 20–47 years old, and all met the above‐mentioned eligibility criteria. Please see Table1, which presents the participants’ demographic characteristics.

Note:Percentage may not equal 100 due to rounding.

The research team used interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore participants’ detailed experiences, emphasizing their subjective meanings and how personal contexts shaped their views of barriers (Smith et al.2009). The team used Microsoft Word to assist in the data analysis process. First, data analysis occurred concurrently with data collection. The research team met regularly to share their reflections on the interviews. This iterative process allowed the team to refine themes in real time through regular debriefings and the development of follow‐up questions. Second, the first author read all the transcripts separately without making any notes to get a global sense of the entire data set. Third, the same author reread the transcripts. Then, he made notes, which included summaries, explanations, and connections, and highlighted relevant quotes. Fourth, the same author selected the relevant quotes for each potential theme by critically evaluating each quote's relevance and its contribution to illustrating the core phenomena under study. Fifth, the other authors reviewed the selected quotes to refine the initial interpretations. Sixth, the team collaboratively named each theme through an iterative process to ensure they reflected participants’ experiences. Seventh, themes and quotes were shared with a few TNB participants for member checking, allowing them to affirm or question the interpretations and strengthen credibility. Eighth, the team finalized the themes and descriptions after further discussion and comparison with raw data to ensure they were thorough and grounded in lived experiences.

The target population of this study was TNB adults in Canada. This study focused on the barriers to accessing RCMFT services. The four authors’ academic and clinical interests and social locations were connected to the target population. They were all RCMFT therapists. They were members of 2SLGBTQ+ communities in Canada, including two cisgender gay men, one transgender queer person, and one nonbinary queer person. This study team had diverse cultural backgrounds, including people of color and newcomers. They were passionate about exploring and improving mental health and relationships, and the utilization of systemic therapy services among 2SLGBTQ+ people in Canada. Additionally, the first and second authors were faculty members, and the third and fourth authors were graduate students.

To ensure the trustworthiness of this qualitative study, the research team engaged in several processes according to the guidelines initially developed by Lincoln and Guba (1985) and suggested by Elliott et al. (1999), which emphasize credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. To address credibility, three participants with diverse perspectives were invited to the member‐checking process via Zoom, and they were also voluntary to engage in this process. They provided detailed feedback on the analyzed themes and descriptions, which enabled the team to refine their interpretations. To ensure transferability, the research team made a concerted effort to recruit participants across Canada with diverse ethnic backgrounds, aiming to achieve a minimum of 50% representation from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) groups. The semi‐structured interviews ensured that the research team asked broad interview questions that could be applicable to other community members. To address dependability, after the first author analyzed the results, the themes, descriptions, and quotes were checked by other authors who were academically and clinically knowledgeable about the target population. Moreover, regular team meetings during data collection and analysis helped the authors to reflect on their experience, minimize their biases, and prevent preconceptions from shaping interpretations. Regarding confirmability, data saturation was achieved when consecutive interviews yielded no new themes, indicating that the data saturation point was reached and the data set was sufficiently robust to capture the range of participants’ experiences.

Due to the existing cisnormativity and heteronormativity in many therapeutic modalities, TNB participants experienced challenges in finding an RCMFT therapist who was able to understand 2SLGBTQ+ populations. This reflects a need for therapists with the professional competence and cultural sensitivity necessary for affirming care. For example, “finding an explicitly queer‐affirming therapist in Winnipeg was difficult” (28 years old, Manitoba), “I really could not find any polyamorous inclusive therapists” (34 years old, Alberta), and “trying to find someone who was queer‐friendly or at least knowledgeable was difficult” (36 years old, Alberta). The participants also expected to work with an RCMFT who was in the 2SLGBTQ+ community or had connections with 2SLGBTQ+ people, so the therapist would have more direct knowledge of working with TNB clients. This expectation underscores the demand for practitioners who bring both relevant lived experience and specialized knowledge to their therapeutic practice.

As mentioned in the first theme, the participants spent significant time finding culturally competent and gender identity‐affirming therapists. However, they experienced some challenges based on their geographic location. The participants reported that the preferred therapists were not in their area. A participant (41 years old, Ontario) said, “The counselor we did find online at the time was located in Toronto, but was not in our area. Traveling for counseling would not be an option for us.” Another participant (36 years old, Alberta) said, “We had difficulties accessing therapy services because we live rurally, and we don't live close to a city or a town.” These accounts highlight how geographic isolation intensifies structural barriers, with urban centers offering greater access to specialized services compared to rural regions.

Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, many RCMFT therapists were willing to provide virtual sessions to lower the barriers to accessing therapy because of the clients’ geographic locations. Some participants appreciated the virtual sessions (e.g., a participant (34 years old, Alberta) said, “When the pandemic happened, they already had the infrastructure to do online appointments. And my ex‐husband was very hesitant to leave the house. So online appointments lowered our barrier.”) However, some participants still preferred the in‐person sessions (e.g., a participant (30 years old, Saskatchewan) said, “I don't want to do anything virtually. I don't feel comfortable about that.”) This suggests that while virtual therapy can help overcome distance barriers, it may not work for everyone.

Moreover, the participants experienced challenges in accessing virtual sessions, such as time differences, emotional distance, and technological issues. A participant (47 years old, Saskatchewan) said, “The therapist was based in Montreal at that time. So, there's a time difference. So, I had a very bad calculation, and we actually missed the first session due to my misunderstanding of the scheduled time,” “Knowing that my counselor was in Montreal, I felt there was a real distance between the counselor and us,” and “We attended the online session where I had one laptop and my wife was in another room with another laptop because we needed our own space to talk. If we only had one laptop, we had to squeeze in next to each other and go through a very difficult couple counseling. It is going to be a very challenging space for us.” These examples show that while virtual therapy can be flexible, it also comes with practical and emotional challenges that shape how clients feel during sessions. At the same time, some participants found ways to make it work, reflecting how varied these experiences can be.

Some participants who lived in rural areas and preferred in‐person RCMFT sessions shared their worries about the possibility of breaking confidentiality. A participant (41 years old, Ontario) said, “There's a little bit of concern there because I live in a small Canadian city of 125,000 people. So, if you're in your thirties and forties, you probably know each other.” and “I worried that the therapists might break confidentiality, particularly in a smaller geographical location.” This concern reflects the heightened sensitivity around privacy in smaller communities, where overlapping personal and professional networks can undermine trust in therapeutic relationships.

In many small cities and rural areas, 2SLGBTQ+ communities are relatively small, which means Queer‐identified therapists might also know many 2SLGBTQ+ people in the communities. A participant expressed that it was challenging to avoid dual relationships with the preferred therapists: “For my partner, it was harder to figure out how to be safe with a particular counselor because they were well known in the community. They did a lot of early trans activism and were involved in the kind of non‐profit space” (38 years old, Alberta). This shows how overlapping social roles can make it harder for clients to feel safe to self‐disclose.

During the interviews, financial concerns were highly emphasized. Many participants expressed that RCMFT sessions were not affordable. For example, “It's really expensive, and if you don't work, you cannot afford couple counseling” (47 years old, Saskatchewan), “I could not find anybody for less than 220 an hour. That's a lot. And we needed a good two‐hour session.” (30 years old, Saskatchewan), “[The amount] for Alberta is just over 200.” (34 years old, Alberta), and “I was low‐income, and my partner was from the States. And he couldn't work in Canada” (28 years old, Manitoba). These quotes illustrate that high therapy costs serve as a significant barrier for clients; moreover, the barrier reinforces the existing inequalities in accessing mental health services.

One participant (41 years old, Ontario) was not able to pay for therapy, but their partners could. The participant said, “My other ex was a doctor. She had significantly more money than I did. So, she paid.” The participant also expressed that financial status in the relationship would influence searching for therapists. The participant said, “Whereas with my ex‐girlfriend in our twenties, you know, we were kind of a bit more searching out together. We kind of had a bit more equality in the process of selecting the therapist because we both were funding it equally.” and “Because she [the doctor] was going to be the one funding it. I just sort of accepted the arrangement that she made. So, she had booked the appointment for the initial session and then sent me the details and said. Because she was going to be funding it, it was kind of a bit more of her decision.” This indicates that financial disparities within relationships can influence therapeutic choices and exacerbate power imbalances in accessing care.

In Canada, there was some financial support for RCMFT sessions. The participants were able to pay for therapy with insurance. For example, “We have the privilege. We can pay by insurance, and not every gay couple could do that.” (47 years old, Saskatchewan) and “My mom was incredibly insured and established. It was through Blue Cross.” (28 years old, Manitoba). The participants were able to receive therapy services, which offered sliding scale options. For example, “They did slide the scale down. I think we were paying like $40.” (34 years old, Alberta) and “My partner and I can't really afford most services that are out there unless they offer compassionate pricing or pricing for low‐income people.” (36 years old, Alberta). These examples show that while some people benefit from financial support like insurance or sliding scales, such options are inconsistent, reinforcing cost as a key concern.

This theme encompasses both the internal and relational challenges, as well as the external institutional obstacles, that participants faced when seeking RCMFT services. The internal resistance was a key barrier to accessing RCMFT sessions, including the participants’ own resistance (e.g., a participant (28 years old, Manitoba) said, “I guess mostly just like a level of hesitancy.”) and their partners’ own resistance (e.g., a participant (36 years old, Alberta) said, “Resistance from my partner was the major contributor to accessing couples therapy to begin with.”). The internal resistance seemed to be rooted in some cultural stigmas. For example, a participant (36 years old, Alberta) said, “There's the belief that if you have to go to therapy, there's something terribly wrong.” Another participant (21 years old, Saskatchewan) said, “People are nosy, and people ask why do you need that?” and “People in my life didn't support me going to therapy.” An Asian participant (47 years old, Saskatchewan) emphasized the cultural impact: “Because Asians believe that you don't talk to other people outside your family about your problems.” These examples reveal that internalized stigma and cultural norms did more than discourage help‐seeking; they transformed therapy into a symbolic act of defiance against familial loyalty, emotional restraint, and collective expectations, especially within stigmatizing or collectivist cultures.

This tension between personal identity and societal norms also seemed to influence other major decisions made by the participants, including those related to religion, community, and trust in professional support. Moreover, the participants experienced certain insecurities regarding the acceptance of TNB people in general society and projected them onto the process of seeking therapists. The participants expressed their worries about being TNB clients; for example, “I would say at the start, there was a little bit of worry. Just because he's trans, and I'm nonbinary. We weren't sure how that would work into therapy.” (28 years old, Manitoba) The participants expressed their worries about working with faith‐based therapists; for example, “We have faced religious trauma within our community. So those are not the resources that we go to.” (47 years old, Saskatchewan), “The town we lived in was like a small city, but it was very conservative and very religious. So, a lot of counselors that I have seen in that area often brought their religion into the conversation. Even though we are not religious. So that was counterproductive.” (20 years old, Manitoba) The participants expressed their worries about the lack of cultural competence or connection among therapists; for example, a participant (30 years old, Saskatchewan) said, “One barrier we were having was the cultural connection. So, my brother didn't feel comfortable because he was an Indigenous person.” and “We wanted somebody who offered Two‐Spirit counseling for couples. We could not find it anywhere in Canada. We searched all over.” These quotes show that participants faced personal, societal, and anticipatory concerns about therapists’ cultural competence, all of which made access to care more difficult.

Participants also identified some relational barriers. The participants expressed that the person who initiated seeking help from RCMFT providers was often responsible for contacting therapists. For example, “Since I am the one who was asking him to do it, I would feel that it would be my responsibility to do this.” (34 years old, Saskatchewan) The participants expressed that their partner or parent did not feel comfortable attending RCMFT sessions. For example, “Finding a couple therapist was hard because you're not looking just for yourself, and you also had to check with your partner. I'm comfortable with counseling, but my wife is not. So, I'm someone who actually can bring in issues about our marriage and stuff, and my wife will be just sitting down there and agreeing and all that.” (47 years old, Saskatchewan), “I needed to convince my father to go to therapy together. It was not easy. It's not only about the ability of the therapist but also more about how to find a therapist who my father would like to go to the sessions with me.” (34 years old, Saskatchewan), and “My partner was not comfortable with it because they didn't want to be judged for the way that our relationship dynamic was. They didn't want our relationship to be analyzed, to make it look like they were weak, and they weren't out to everybody.” (30 years old, Saskatchewan) Moreover, a participant (47 years old, Saskatchewan) said, “We needed to make a lot of arrangements within ourselves to go for a session,” even if they wanted to have RCMFT sessions. These relational dynamics show how navigating personal, family, and partner roles adds to the burden of seeking therapy and complicates decision‐making.

In addition to these systemic and relational challenges, participants encountered notable institutional barriers. There were some institutional barriers that the participants experienced. While contacting agencies to match with an RCMFT therapist, participants sought specific approaches, but it appeared that the agencies lacked RCMFT therapists offering these approaches. For example, “It was not easy to find a therapist who was trained in the Satir family system and also had knowledge about 2SLGBTQ in Canada.” (47 years old, Saskatchewan), “We couldn't find any therapists who had expertise in play therapy and psychodrama in Canada.” (30 years old, Saskatchewan), and “If you [as a therapist] are going to counsel queer, the queer population, you need to know, you need to be trauma‐informed.” (41 years old, British Columbia). The participants also expected to work with therapists who had specific knowledge. For example, “That spiritual family counseling doesn't exist, and Two‐Spirit couples counseling doesn't exist.” (30 years old, Saskatchewan), “We needed somebody who was queer and also had knowledge about fertility issues.” (38 years old, Alberta), and “My partner and I had different mental health barriers and challenges, so we needed someone who could understand both of our perspectives.” (36 years old, Alberta) These quotes show how limited training and specialized services restrict access, leaving participants with few options that meet their needs.

Some participants felt frustrated while contacting the agencies to start an RCMFT session. First, participants expressed that the waiting list was usually quite long. For example, “Most people who are seeking out couple counselling would probably need it within a week or two or three.” (41 years old, Ontario), “I remember it was over a year for sure. They had two waitlists, one for high‐risk and one for non‐high‐risk. I was not high‐risk because I wasn't suicidal or there were no concerns of me harming myself or others.” (20 years old, Manitoba), “The wait lists, even for private, are extortionately long.” (21 years old, Saskatchewan) Second, accessing the RCMFT services on a sliding scale or without cost was challenging. For example, “The no‐cost therapy service had limits. I had signed up a couple of times trying to get in, but I didn't qualify. It's hard to say that your struggles are more important than someone else's. We can't be ranking our traumas here.” (28 years old, Manitoba) Third, the accessibility to the RCMFT services was lacking in some agencies. For example, “Accessibility is a huge issue. I have mobility issues, so with that, it was very difficult to find places that had user‐friendly accessibility.” (21 years old, Saskatchewan) Lastly, scheduling the time for RCMFT sessions was difficult. For example, “It was not easy to find therapists who offered the services that could be done in the evening time.” (36 years old, Alberta) and “We both had to take time off work to go on a weekday.” (20 years old, Manitoba) One participant (30 years old, Saskatchewan) even said, “The therapist canceled those dates. Then, they went on maternity leave, and we got screwed.” These institutional challenges show that structural issues such as long waitlists, limited funding, poor accessibility, and scheduling conflicts further hinder timely and effective access to RCMFT services.

There are similarities between the results of the existing and present studies. The existing studies emphasized the cost and insurance coverage issues (Beauregard et al.2017; Holt et al.2023). These issues were discussed in the third theme (Financial concerns). The existing studies stated that some therapists lacked nuance and skills in working with TNB clients (Dalton et al.2020; McCullough et al.2017; Mizock and Lundquist2016; Snow et al.2019). In the first theme (Challenges in finding competent and affirming therapists) and the fourth theme (Systemic and institutional barriers to accessing RCMFT services), the preferred social locations and personal backgrounds, the lack of connections with 2SLGBTQ+ people, and the lack of specific approaches and knowledge among the RCMFT therapists were discussed.

Moreover, the existing studies emphasized the TNB people's experiences of oppressive, discriminatory, and harmful behaviors by care providers (Amarante et al.2024; Dalton et al.2020; Hunsicker et al.2024; Maoto and Davis2024; McCullough et al.2017; Mizock and Lundquist2016). In the fourth theme (Systemic and institutional barriers to accessing RCMFT services), the systemic impacts were discussed, such as the cultural stigmas and societal insecurities the TNB participants experienced and projected onto the process of seeking therapists and the reported lack of cultural competence or connection among therapists.

There are also differences between the results of the existing and present studies. The existing studies discussed the issues related to gender conversion therapy and gate‐keeping that TNB people experience (Anzani et al.2019; Gosling et al.2022; Mizock and Lundquist2016; Soled et al.2022). However, these issues were not mentioned during the interviews in the present study. This might mean that Canadian TNB clients experienced little to no gender conversion therapy and gate‐keeping. In the past, a therapist's letter was often needed for gender‐affirming hormone therapy, but this is less common now following updated guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (Coleman et al.2022). Moreover, it also could mean that those Canadian TNB clients who experienced gender conversion therapy and gate‐keeping had little to no motivation to participate in this study.

Moreover, the second theme (Geographic limitations) and the fourth theme (Systemic and institutional barriers to accessing RCMFT services), such as the TNB participants’ internal resistance and the relational barriers, in the present study, were not adequately discussed in the existing literature up until now. Compared to the existing studies, the present study highlights how the participants’ internal struggles, their strained relationships, and the geographic limitations affect their engagement in systemic therapy services.

Despite the present study's contributions, it has three limitations that warrant cautious interpretation of the findings. First, the interviewed participants needed to complete the screening survey via Qualtrics, the consent form via email, and the interview via Zoom. The interested TNB people in Canada who were unfamiliar with the internet or did not have access to technology were excluded from the present study. Second, the interviewed participants needed to be fluent in English because English was the only common language all research team members could use to communicate with the participants and within the research team. Therefore, the interested TNB people in Canada who were not fluent in English were excluded from the present study. Third, the small self‐selecting sample may limit the transferability, which refers to how the present study's findings can be applied to or are relevant to the broader target population (Elliott et al.1999).

According to the methodology, the present study has two strengths. First, although some interested TNB people in Canada were excluded due to technology issues, the recruitment process ensured the diverse backgrounds of the participants. The participants came from five provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan) in Canada, and 50% of them identified as BIPOC. Second, virtual interviews reduced the time and effort required to travel to the interview location compared to in‐person interviews. They also ensured that the participants could schedule interviews at times that suited them and in settings where they felt secure.

Given the reliance on online recruitment and virtual interviews, future studies should incorporate in‐person recruitment strategies and interviews to engage TNB people who may lack reliable internet access or technological proficiency. Future research should integrate multilingual recruitment and data collection strategies to include the voices of TNB individuals who are not fluent in English. Expanding the sample size would allow for a broader exploration of experiences in Canada and, furthermore, enhance the transferability of the findings.

The results of the present study can be shared in teaching, supervision, workshops, and conference presentations to improve cultural competence and humility among faculty members, instructors, supervisors, and students in the RCMFT fields. For example, as mentioned in the results, the TNB participants were looking for culturally competent and gender identity‐affirming RCMFT therapists who could have specific approaches and knowledge and could have informed connections with 2SLGBTQ+ people and their own cultures. Relevant training and preparation will reduce the barriers identified in this paper. The results of the present study can also be shared with RCMFT service providers and agencies in Canada. As mentioned in the results, the TNB participants experienced difficulties arranging virtual sessions, worried that their confidentiality would be broken, and were concerned that they would have dual relationships with therapists in rural areas. Also, the high cost, long waiting lists, lack of accessibility, and difficulties in scheduling the time for RCMFT sessions were mentioned during the interviews. RCMFT service providers and agencies hold resources and power and, thus, are in a position to reduce these barriers accordingly.

The present study explored the TNB participants’ barriers to seeking RCMFT services in Canada. Four themes were extracted, including Theme 1 (Challenges in finding competent and affirming therapists), Theme 2 (Geographic location limited the options), Theme 3 (Cost was a primary concern, and Theme 4 (Systemic and institutional barriers impacting access to RCMFT services). Academically, the present study can significantly fill the gap in the current literature because there are differences between the results of the previous studies and the present study. Clinically, the present study can improve cultural competence among therapists and reduce barriers to accessing therapy sessions in the RCMFT fields.
