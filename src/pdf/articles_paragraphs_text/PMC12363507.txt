The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is recommended for adults to prevent pneumococcal diseases, while its effectiveness over time remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the age- and time-dependent effectiveness of PPV23 in reducing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) incidence among adults aged 60 and older in China. We conducted a prospective cohort study in Shanghai, China, identifying CAP cases via inpatient and outpatient medical records. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated using Cox regression models with time-dependent vaccination status, adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and seasonal influenza activity. Subgroup analyses stratified by age group, comorbidity status, and observation period were performed. A total of 35,491 participants were included, yielding observation of 158,448 person-years. Overall incidence of CAP was 30.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.83, 31.57) per 1000 person-years. PPV23 seemed to be ineffective when encompassing all cohort participants in the initial analyses. However, subgroup analyses showed significant adjusted VE for those vaccinated before age 60 (VE = 32.83%, 95% CI: 16.40, 46.03). Significant protection was observed within the first-year post-vaccination (VE = 43.63%, 95% CI: 25.30, 57.47) but declined over time. Furthermore, age-time stratification indicated valid protection for those vaccinated before age 65 within the first year. In addition, VE was higher in those without comorbidities. PPV23 demonstrated modest effectiveness against CAP among those vaccinated before the age of 65 within the first year and decline over time. These findings advocate for prioritizing PPV23 vaccination before age 65 to maximize short-term protection against CAP, underscoring the need for effective booster strategies.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most prevalent infectious disease, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality, particularly among older adults. In China, there were approximately 8.8 hospitalized CAP cases per 1000 person-years, with a 30-day mortality rate of 2.5%.1Notably, the elderly were especially susceptible to CAP, often experiencing worse prognoses due to underlying health conditions.Streptococcus pneumoniae(S. pneumoniae) is a common pathogen in CAP, accounting for nearly 20% of CAP cases. Additionally, CAP patients confirmed withS. pneumoniaeinfection were associated with higher complication rates and medical costs.2,3The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened awareness and concern regarding respiratory vaccine effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of real-world effectiveness evaluations of vaccines including the 23-valent pneumococcal capsule polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23).

While PPV23 has been shown to be effective against IPD, its effectiveness appears to decline over time, particularly after 5 years. Studies have suggested that the VE against IPD decreases with age and individuals with underlying co-morbidities may experience even lower effectiveness.4,10However, age- or time- specific effectiveness of PPV23 specifically against CAP has not been well-defined.

Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) were widely adapted to immunization programs in developed countries, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) encouraged follow-up vaccination of PPV23 with a minimum gap of 1 year from the PCV vaccination since PPV23 covers additional serotypes not included in conjugate vaccines.11,12In China, PCV use is limited to children under five, whereas the older adults also face a significant burden of pneumococcal diseases.13In this case, PPV23 is the only pneumococcal vaccine officially approved to be used among adults.14Although PPV23 was not included in the national immunization program, Shanghai launched a major public health initiative in September 2013, providing free PPV23 vaccination to residents aged 60 years and older. By the end of 2023, over 1 million elderly residents had been vaccinated under this program.15,16Subsequently, several cities had also carried out PPV23 vaccination campaigns, where the vaccination coverage was found to be at around 1.23%~42.10%.17,18Nonetheless, the PPV23 vaccination program in China is still in its early stage, with room for further improvement in its strategy.

Uncertainties regarding VE against CAP, as well as key aspects including the rate of waning immunity and the optimal age for vaccination remain barriers to achieving the goals of the vaccination program. Therefore, this study aims to assess the VE of PPV23 based on Shanghai Suburban Adult Cohort and Biobank (SSACB), investigating possible variations after stratification by age at vaccination and time. As the first city in China to incorporate PPV23 into immunization program, Shanghai offered a unique setting to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine. Understanding these patterns is critical not only for assessing whether vaccine protection remains valid over time and across different age groups but also for identifying the optimal age groups for vaccination.

SSACB is a prospective cohort study that recruited 69,116 individuals aged 20–74 years from four districts (Songjiang, Jiading, Xuhui, and Minhang) in Shanghai between April 2016 and December 2019 (Figure 1).19Cohort members who were aged 60 years or older at any point during the study period were included. Baseline characteristics were recorded thorough interviewer-administered electronic questionnaires. Physical examinations including height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate were conducted on enrolled participants. The cohort follow-ups involved in-person surveys and annual checks of local health information systems. Vaccination records were collected through centers for disease control and prevention in Songjiang, Jiading, and Minhang districts. Variables including age at vaccination, vaccination dates, vaccine types, doses, vaccine products were also collected. Baseline information were linked to vaccination data via personal identification index.

The SSCAB cohort was established between April 2016 and December 2019, with 32.3% of participants receiving PPV23 before enrollment and 11.9% after. For those vaccinated before enrollment, the observation gap was defined as the period between vaccination and enrollment. A total of 4,863 individuals were diagnosed with CAP during the study.

Outpatient and hospitalization records were collected from local health information system, linked to the baseline data using personal identification codes. Pneumonia cases were identified using ICD-10 codes J12-J18. Diagnosis descriptions of those without valid ICD-10 codes were examined using the term “pneumonia”, excluding non-relevant diagnoses such as “chemical pneumonia”. Multiple visits within 30 days by the same patient were considered as one single CAP episode. Outpatient records overlapped with hospitalization were excluded. Only first-time CAP episode during the observation period was taken into consideration.

Demographic characteristics including sex, age, and education level were involved in this study. Diagnoses of underlying diseases were determined based on self-reported history and physical examination results. Smoking was defined as smoking at least one cigarette daily for a continuous period of 6 months or more, and it was classified into never smokers and smokers. Drinking was defined as drinking alcohol at least three times weekly for 6 months or more. When considering the dose–response relationship, alcohol, and tobacco consumption were grouped based on suggested intake from Chinese dietary guidelines.20Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated determined by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.

Vaccination status for influenza and COVID-19 was included as covariates. Influenza vaccination was determined based on receipt of the vaccine in the current and prior seasons, and participants were categorized as either vaccinated or unvaccinated. COVID-19 vaccination status was classified according to the number of doses received: unvaccinated, or vaccinated with one, two, three, or four doses. The start and end of the influenza season were determined separately for each year.21Considering the impact of policies including children immunization with PCV13, calendar year of each record was included during adjustment. Non- pharmacological intervention (NPI) periods were defined according to initiate and cessation of NPIs against SARS-CoV-2: 1) Before NPIs: December 1, 2016–November 30, 2020; 2) During NPIs: December 1, 2020–November 30, 2022; 3) After NPIs: December 1, 2022-March 31, 2023.

The distribution of PPV23 vaccination status and CAP outcomes was summarized based on key variables. Variations were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. To capture changes in variables of interest, multiple records for each cohort member were collected over the observation period. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidences and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Vaccination status for PPV23, influenza, and COVID-19 was incorporated as external time-dependent variables in the Cox regression model. All individuals were classified as vaccinated 14 days following receipt of immunization, while unvaccinated periods were treated as non-exposed time. For each participant, follow-up time was split at the date of each vaccination event, and vaccination status was updated accordingly. NPI period was included as a time-dependent covariate to account for changes in CAP incidence due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related interventions. Yearly updated age and influenza activity were also considered as time-dependent variables in the model.

We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of CAP by comparing the risk among individuals who were vaccinated with PPV23 to the unvaccinated ones using cox regression while adjusting for potential confounding factors. VE was calculated as (1–HR) × 100%.

To assess the time-dependent effects of PPV23, we defined the start point of those who were unvaccinated as the time of them entering the cohort and as the date of PPV23 vaccination for those with PPV23 vaccination. Similarly, when calculating age at PPV23 vaccination, age of entering the cohort was set as the virtual vaccination age for those without vaccination. Time since PPV23 vaccination was grouped into “less than 1 year,” “1–2 years,” “3 years and over” to better capture the time-dependent changes in protection of PPV23 against CAP. In order to capture the trend of changes in the effectiveness, VE for each individual year since PPV23 vaccination was estimated with a cubic spline and linear decline. Subgroup analyses were conducted within yearly-updated age and age at PPV23 vaccination groups. Protection of PPV23 among populations with various underlying condition status was also estimated.

Considering that there were participants who received PPV23 vaccination before enrolled to SSACB, sensitivity analysis based on the interval between time starting observation and PPV23 vaccination was performed. All P values were 2-sided, and significance was defined asP< 0.05. All data analyses were performed using R, version 4.2.

This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health, Fudan University (IRB approval number 2016–04–0586-S1), and all participants provided written informed consent.

SSACB had recruited 69,116 subjects by December 2019, with 97.06% (67,708) having completed baseline surveys. After excluding subjects with incomplete responses, extreme outliers, and missing vaccination records, a total of 36,296 subjects aged 60 and older were included in the analysis, yielding 158,448 person-years of observation (Figure 1andTable 1).

Person-years at risk by characteristics with different vaccination and CAP statuses.

Among the total population, males accounted for 43.53% of the total person-years, while females accounted for 56.47%. At baseline, only less than one-fifth of observation period was contributed by participants with no chronic conditions.

There were 44.20% of the participants who were vaccinated with PPV23, with 32.30% vaccinated before enrolled into the cohort and 11.90% after enrolled (Table S1 andFigure 1). These vaccinated individuals contributed 86,879 person-years (54.83%) to the observation period, while unvaccinated individuals accounted for 71,568 person-years (45.17%) (Table 1). Among males, the vaccination coverage was higher compared to females. Vaccination coverage increased with age, with individuals aged 70 years or older representing the largest proportion of vaccinated participants (57.25%), followed by those aged 65–69 years (55.61%) and those under 65 years (35.29%) (Table S1). In addition, participants with comorbidities had higher vaccination rates, especially those with respiratory diseases (Table S1).

Across the study period, the incidence rates of overall CAP, outpatient CAP, and inpatient CAP were 30.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.83, 31.57), 27.73 (95% CI: 26.91, 28.56), and 2.97 (95% CI: 2.70, 3.25) per 1,000 person-years, respectively (Table 2). An increasing trend of CAP incidence with age was found among inpatient cases. Among individuals vaccinated with PPV23, the incidence rates were 31.28 (95% CI: 30.00, 32.61) for overall CAP, 28.17 (95% CI: 26.95, 29.43) for outpatient CAP, and 3.12 (95% CI: 2.72, 3.55) for inpatient CAP per 1,000 person-years (Table 2). No significant difference in crude CAP incidences was observed between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. However, among individuals aged under 65 years, the estimated CAP incidence was higher in those who had not received PPV23 compared to vaccinated participants. Conversely, among participants aged 65 years or older, a higher incidence of inpatient CAP was noted in those vaccinated with PPV23.

Overall adjusted effectiveness of PPV23 was estimated at 1.05% (95% CI: −4.90, 6.66), 0.68% (95% CI: −5.62, 6.60), 2.07% (95% CI: −17.86, 18.63) against total, outpatient, and inpatient CAP cases, separately. When comparing VE across the three age groups, individuals aged under 65 years old demonstrated the highest VE (6.21%, 95% CI: −4.96, 16.20) (Figure S1). However, these estimates are not statistically significant, and no significant differences were observed across the age groups. A similar age-related trend was noted in the adjusted VE estimates against outpatient CAP cases, with VE decreasing as age increased. Notably, individuals vaccinated before age 60 exhibited 78.84% VE (95% CI: 27.97, 93.78) in the first year – declining to 20.43% (95% CI: −5.17, 39.80) by year 3 (Figure S2). This trend, however, was not observed for inpatient CAP cases. When stratified by comorbidity status, VE exhibited a consistent decline with an increasing number of underlying conditions. VE was the highest among individuals without underlying conditions, followed by those with one, two, three, and more comorbidities, demonstrating a number-dependent trend (Figure S3). Among individuals without any underlying conditions, VE declined with increasing age.

In terms of age at PPV23 vaccination, PPV23 vaccinated before 60 years old provided the greatest protection against overall and outpatient CAP (32.83%, 95% CI: 16.40, 46.03) (Figure S1). As age at PPV23 vaccination increased, the effectiveness was less distinct and statistically less significant (Figure S1). Similarly, PPV23 vaccination demonstrated greater effectiveness when administered at a younger age, among individuals with underlying conditions. For participants free of chronic diseases, the highest VE was found when vaccinated between 60 and 64 years old (18.71%, 95% CI: −0.26, 34.09) and was the lowest in those vaccinated at 70 and over (−91.49%, 95% CI: −257.68, −2.52). Among individuals vaccinated between 60 and 69 years old, lower estimates of VE were observed in those with comorbidities (Figure S3).

In general, VE of PPV23 declined with time since vaccination, from 43.63% (95% CI: 25.30, 57.47) for individuals vaccinated within 1 year, to 3.25% (95% CI: −22.14, 23.36) for 1 year later, and 0.76% (95% CI: −7.37, 8.27) for 3 years and more (Figure S2). A similar waning pattern was observed in protection against both outpatient and inpatient CAP, though VE for inpatient CAP was not statistically significant. The cubic spline model showed a time-dependent trend in the annual estimated VE of PPV23, initially declining from 43.63% (95% CI: 25.30–57.47) and slightly increasing after 3 years, though with wide confidence intervals (Figure 2).

Adjusted overall PPV23 VE against CAP with time after PPV23 vaccination status.

Adjusted VE of PPV23 showed significant protection within the first year after vaccination but declined over time. The blue line represents the trend in annual estimated VE, while the green dashed line indicates the linear trend.

The adjusted model included sex, age, COVID-19 vaccination, influenza vaccine receipt in the prior season, influenza vaccine receipt in the current season, influenza season, smoking, drinking status, BMI, NPI periods, and comorbidity as covariates.

VE varied across different vaccination age groups but followed a similar waning pattern. Notably, significant protection was observed only in individuals who received vaccination when they were under 60 years old (78.84% [95% CI: 27.97, 93.78)] and 60–64 years old (38.23% [95% CI: 10.43, 57.41)] within the first year after vaccination (Figure S2). For population vaccinated at different ages, waning in adjusted VE of PPV23 with time was still captured by a spline model, particularly among individuals vaccinated under 60 years of age (Figure 3). Gradually, by the third-year post-vaccination, the VE had declined to 20.43% (95% CI: −5.17, 39.80) and −3.26% (95% CI: −17.43, 9.20) for individuals vaccinated at <60 and 60–64 years old, respectively (Figure 3and Figure S2). For individuals with fewer than three comorbidities, we observed significant VE within 1 year after vaccination, with estimates of 69.22% (95% CI: 31.48–86.18) for those with no comorbidities, 42.74% (95% CI: 4.42–65.70) for those with one comorbidity, and 45.44% (95% CI: 6.05–68.32) for those with two comorbidities. After further stratification by age at vaccination, significant protection was observed in individuals vaccinated before age 65 and without comorbidities, particularly within the first-year post-vaccination (Figure S4).

(D) Adjusted PPV23 VE against CAP with time after PPV23 vaccination status among individuals vaccinated at 70 years old or older. The blue line indicated the trend for annual estimated VE. The green dashed line indicated liner trend. No significant VE was observed.

The adjusted model included sex, age, COVID-19 vaccination, influenza vaccine receipt in the prior season, influenza vaccine receipt in the current season, influenza season, smoking, drinking status, BMI, NPI periods, and comorbidity as covariates.

To account for participants with a gap between vaccination and observation dates, we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricting VE estimation to those without such gaps. Among individuals without an observation gap, the incidence rates of overall CAP, outpatient CAP were slightly higher, but the inpatient CAP incidence was lower compared to the main study (Table S2).

Among this subgroup, the overall VE was 51.28% (95% CI: 32.53–64.83) within the first-year post-vaccination, declining to −7.27% (95% CI: −25.79–8.52) after 3 years (Figure S5). After stratification of age at vaccination, we observed significant VE within 1 year when vaccinated before 65 years old.

This prospective cohort study evaluated the VE of PPV23 against CAP among adults in Shanghai, China. After stratification of the less significant overall VE, PPV23 demonstrated strong protection in the first-year post-vaccination, with particularly higher effectiveness among individuals aged under 65 years. However, VE against CAP declined with increasing age and time since vaccination, showing significant protection in individuals vaccinated before age 65 and within 1 year of vaccination. These findings align with previous studies on PPV23 effectiveness while providing novel insights into its time- and age-dependent waning patterns.

Inconsistent results on the vaccine’s effectiveness for pneumonia have been reported, in which some observational studies indicated significant protection,22whereas others failed to identify a significant overall protective effect against all-cause pneumonia, as in our study. PPV23 was association with a reduction of 25% (95% CI: 2–42%) against all-cause CAP among the general population aged ≥60 years in the CAPAMIS study only after multivariable adjustment, which further suggested the validity of our result.23Our study was based on a prospective cohort with strong electronic data linkage, especially for the case ascertainment including both outpatient and inpatient CAP, reducing the impact of selection bias. In addition, it was worth noting that the CAPAMIS study was conducted after the introduction of PCV, which targeted at fewer serotypes but with higher efficacy.6,24Following widespread vaccination of PCV, shifts in circulating pneumococcal serotypes could occur, contributing to decreased effectiveness of PPV23.25Furthermore, the high effectiveness and extensive use of PCV reduced CAP incidence both through direct protection and herd immunity.26,27However, PCV has not been issued for adult use so far in China, which avoided the impact of PCV implementation.

Several studies have reported that the effectiveness of PPV23 against IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia remains stable for the first 5-year post-vaccination, with a subsequent decline thereafter.4,10,28,29However, the waning pattern of PPV23 effectiveness against CAP has been less thoroughly investigated, with some studies with the observation period only up to 5 years.30One study focusing on COPD patients indicated the effectiveness of PPV23 decreased starting with the second year, which was consistent with our results.31Notably, while point estimates of VE beyond 3 years since vaccination appeared higher in certain subgroups, the confidence intervals were wide and largely overlapping, suggesting statistical uncertainty due to small sample sizes. Excluding observation gaps in the sensitivity analysis yielded a stronger first-year VE estimate (51.3% vs. 43.6% in the primary analysis; Figure S5), highlighting that timely and continuous vaccination and follow-up are critical for optimal protection. The age-related decline in VE observed in our study also aligns with point estimate trends reported in previous studies.22Although VE in subjects aged 60–79 years old and no less than 80 years old were not statistically significant, the younger group exhibited higher point estimate in the previous study. This discrepancy may be attributed to previous studies not simultaneously accounting for both time since vaccination and age. By incorporating age-time stratification, our study provides a more nuanced and detailed understanding of PPV23 effectiveness. In terms of age at vaccination, apart from several studies reporting decreased VE against IPD within 5 years after PPV23 vaccination, this decline was also observed against pneumonia.31,32Based on our observed decline in VE against CAP, we suggested PPV23 vaccination before the age of 65 years old could show a significant VE within 1 year, while the previous study observed effective protection only for patients younger than 55 years and had a limitation on the duration of the effect.31This divergence may be attributable to the more pronounced immunosenescence and higher comorbidity burden observed among older adults in China compared to Western cohorts. Notably, 57.3% of the participants vaccinated at age ≥70 in our study had two or more comorbidities (Table S1), which may help explain the reduced vaccine effectiveness beyond age 65. In addition, our study further broke down into strata on time since vaccination, which was able to depict detailed patterns in PPV23 VE among populations vaccinated at different ages. However, we also observed that among individuals vaccinated at age 70 years or older, PPV23 was associated with a higher incidence of CAP. This association disappeared after stratification by time since vaccination. This phenomenon may be due to residual confounding and healthy vaccinee bias, as older adults with more comorbidities are more likely to receive vaccination, despite adjustment for measured covariates. Moreover, the wide and overlapping confidence intervals indicate limited statistical power and potential data sparsity in this subgroup. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Our study incorporated a range of time-dependent variables, such as influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as the seasonal interruption of influenza activity, to better reflect real-world conditions. By accounting for these dynamic factors, we aimed to simulate and evaluate vaccine effectiveness under realistic settings while minimizing potential confounding. This comprehensive approach allows for a more accurate assessment of PPV23 effectiveness in the real world, given the potential biases associated with population selection, insufficient allocation concealment, or failure to blind subjects in clinical trials.33,34Such considerations are essential for producing results that can directly inform public health policies and optimize vaccination strategies in heterogeneous populations.

There are still several limitations in our study. First, the follow-up during the post-NPIs period was until March 31, 2023, which failed to cover a complete calendar year in 2023. Moreover, as the SSACB cohort was established between 2016 and 2019, the duration of observation following PPV23 vaccination was limited for many participants. Based on these constraints, time-since-vaccination categories were defined as <1 year, 1–2 years, and ≥3 years. Further stratification of the “≥3 years” group was not feasible, as this would have led to small subgroup sizes and unstable estimates. Therefore, the findings for the “≥3 years since vaccination” subgroup should be interpreted with caution, and future studies with longer follow-up are warranted to further characterize long-term trends in vaccine effectiveness. In addition, the confidence intervals for VE among individuals vaccinated before 60 and after 70 years were relatively wider, which could be attributed to small sample sizes especially after stratification of time since vaccination. Further studies of larger population could help validate the robustness of these results. Second, the effect of PPV23 on the severity of pneumonia was not further analyzed due to lack of clinical information. Besides, analysis considered only the first episode of CAP for each participant, aiming to capture incident rather than recurrent cases. This approach ensures event independence and avoids overestimating incidence due to multiple episodes in the same individual, but may attenuate the age-related increase in CAP risk, as older adults are more likely to have recurrent infections. Nonetheless, focusing on first events allows clearer assessment of risk factors and yields important insights into the burden of newly diagnosed CAP. Further studies incorporating recurrent episodes are needed to more fully characterize the age-dependent risk and overall disease burden. Finally, during our study period, many aspects of epidemiology of CAP changed, though we attempt to control for confounding in the analyses, residual confounding cannot be completely dismissed. Nevertheless, the estimated population-level effects can provide a reasonable estimate of the individual-level VE since the total incidence during the study period was small.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of PPV23 against CAP and its age- and time-dependent patterns among adults aged 60 years and older using data from the SSACB cohort. Our findings indicate that PPV23 provided moderate protection against CAP within the first year of vaccination when administered before the age of 65. These findings highlight the importance of considering both vaccination timing and individual health status when developing pneumococcal vaccine policies for older adults, underscoring the need for optimized vaccination strategies to enhance protection in this population.
