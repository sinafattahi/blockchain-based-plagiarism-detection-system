Legionellapneumonia (LP) is a major cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high morbidity and mortality. ARDS may necessitate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, and evidence is limited about benefits of ECMO in LP. Therefore, we sought to analyze the clinical course, outcomes and predictive factors of ECMO patients with ARDS due to LP compared to non ECMO patients.

This retrospective, multicenter cohort study analyzed ICU patients with LP across three tertiary university hospitals (Zurich, Switzerland; Hannover & Bonn, Germany) from 2013 to 2023. We examined demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes, with a focus on ECMO utilization and its impact on mortality.

A total of 110 patients were included, with a median age of 60 years and 75% male. ECMO support was initiated in 40%. The overall 28-day mortality did not differ between groups, with 21% without ECMO vs. 25% with ECMO (OR 1.24 (0.49–3.05,p= 0.64), despite higher degree of organ failure in the ECMO group (SOFA score 24 h after ICU admission 9 vs. 12,p< 0.001). Only 57% of patients had adequate antibiotic LP coverage at ICU admission with no differences in outcome. Multivariable analysis found hospital acquired LP (OR 28.4 (3.44–614),p= 0.006) and lactate (OR 1.31 (1.05–1.75),p= 0.031) as independent risk factor for 28-day mortality.

Patients suffering from LP requiring ECMO support had similar mortality rates compared to LP patients without ECMO support, despite higher SOFA scores. In addition, LP-induced respiratory failure requiring ECMO had a lower mortality rate compared to the published literature on the overall ARDS population. This indirect indication of a potential survival benefit may support bedside clinicians in their decision-making regarding ECMO initiation or withholding.

Legionella pneumonia (LP) is a relatively rare but important cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP), frequently complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure with some geographical regions reporting a continuous increase of LP cases [1,2]. While extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used in severe ARDS with encouraging results [3], limited data are available on its role in LP-associated ARDS or severe pneumonia [4]. We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study to investigate clinical characteristics, outcomes, and predictors of mortality in critically ill patients with LP, with a particular focus on ECMO support.

We included all adult patients admitted to three tertiary intensive care units (ICUs) in Zurich (Switzerland), Hannover, and Bonn (Germany) between 2013 and 2023 with microbiologically confirmed LP. Clinical data were extracted from electronic health records. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We performed multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors of death and ECMO requirement and compared ECMO and non-ECMO patients. Standard definitions were applied for ARDS (Berlin criteria) [5], septic shock (Sepsis-3) [6], acute kidney injury (KDIGO) [7], and liver injury [8–10], as detailed in the Sec. 1, Definitions.

A total of 110 patients were included (see Supplementary_file, Table 1). Median age was 60 years (IQR 50–70), and 75% were male. Most patients (89%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 40% received additional ECMO support.

Overall, 63% of patients fulfilled ARDS criteria (Supplementary_file, Table 3). ECMO patients had higher SOFA scores at ICU admission (median 12 vs. 9,p< 0.001), more frequent septic shock (66% vs. 36%,p= 0.002) and greater need for renal replacement therapy (75% vs. 45%, 02)p= 0.002), highlighting the overall increased severity of illness in this group. Of all ECMO patients, forty-two were on VV ECMO, two of these patients were upgraded to V-AV-ECMO. Two patients were on VA-ECMO for circulatory support [11]. All ECMO patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). In the ECMO cohort (n= 44), the median PaO₂/FiO₂ (P/F) ratio prior to cannulation was 74 mmHg (IQR 64–86), and the median pCO₂ was 55 mmHg (IQR 44–65). The median arterial pH was low at 7.24 (IQR 7.20–7.31). Among three ECMO patients with moderate ARDS (P/F ratio > 100mmHg), the median pre-cannulation pCO₂ was 65 mmHg (IQR 55–74), suggesting that profound ventilatory failure, rather than isolated hypoxemia, contributed to the decision to initiate ECMO support. One patient had missing data on the P/F ratio prior to cannulation.

Despite higher disease burden, that was also associated with fewer ventilator free days and longer ICU length of stay, 28-day mortality did not significantly differ between the ECMO and non-ECMO groups (25% vs. 21%,p= 0.64, Fig.1). These findings suggest that ECMO may confer a survival benefit in selected patients with LP and severe ARDS. Notably, our observed mortality in this LP-ECMO group was similar (25%) to the general ECMO-treated ARDS population or other studies with this population despite high severity of disease SOFA scores (e.g. ELOIA: mean SOFA score in ECMO group 10.8 with corresponding 30-day mortality 25.8% [12], Andrea et al.:n= 10, median SOFA 9.5 [13]).

Legionella pneumonia was diagnosed by urinary antigen test (UAT) in 70% of cases, either alone (36.4%) or in combination with PCR (33.6%). In 17.8%, UAT was negative but PCR alone confirmed the diagnosis. Conversely, 5.6% had a positive UAT despite negative PCR.Legionella pneumophila(mostly serogroup 1, inferred from UAT positivity) was the most frequently identified species (70%). Four non-pneumophilaspecies were documented, including twoL. bozemanaecases in hospital-acquired infections. The other two wereL. longbeachaeand one species identified asdresdenensisorworsleiensis.

To our surprise, adequateLegionella-specific antibiotic coverage at ICU admission was documented in only 57% of patients. In patients who received LP coverage already on ICU admission, 19 (29%) received levofloxacin, 9 (14.3%) moxifloxacin, 29 (46%) clarithromycin and 4 (6.4%) azithromycin. Three (4.8%) patients received both clarithromycin and levofloxacin. Although mortality was only numerically but not significantly higher in patients without immediate coverage (28% vs. 19%,p= 0.29), delayed therapy was associated with prolonged ICU stay (18 vs. 11 days,p= 0.006) and fewer ventilator-free days (VFD) (3 vs. 13 days,p= 0.024). When adequate antibiotic coverage was initiated within 24 h after ICU admission (83%) rather than immediately at admission, the difference in mortality was numerically slightly higher (32% vs. 21%,p= 0.37), but no significant differences were observed in other outcome parameters.

Hospital-acquired LP (HA-LP) was diagnosed in seven (6.4%) of the patients and was strongly associated with mortality (71% vs. 21%,p= 0.007). After balancing in a multivariate analysis only HA-LP (OR 28.4, 95% CI 3.44–614,p= 0.006) and lactate levels at ICU admission (OR 1.31 per mmol/L, 95% CI 1.05–1.75,p= 0.031) remained independent predictors of death (Supplementary_file, Tables 2 and 5). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was 0.72 for lactate and 0.82 for the MV-analysis (Supplementary_file, Fig.1). Lactate levels of 3.6 mmol/l were identified as optimal cut-off values to predict mortality in LP patients as determined by the Youden Index (0.34) with a sensitivity of 0.44 a specificity of 0.9.

To our knowledge, this is the largest multicenter LP cohort with a large proportion of ECMO-treated patients. Our results show that patients with LP requiring ICU treatment had a high degree of multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock, with mortality rates comparable to those seen in other forms of sCAP.

The lower rate of adequate coverage at ICU admission might be driven by patients who were transferred from outside hospitals (e.g. for ECMO evaluation) or from general wards, where empirical regimens may have lacked Legionella coverage. Nonetheless, 83% of patients received adequate therapy within 24 h, which may explain why no significant difference in mortality was observed — although lack of initial LP antibiotic coverage was associated with increased ICU LOS and reduced VFD. Of note, patients with HA-LP exhibited significantly higher mortality rates, which may be attributed to delayed initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, as empirical Legionella coverage is not routinely recommended for typical HAP. Interestingly, HA-LP included twoL. bozemanaecaes which cannot be identified by routine UAT and may therefore have evaded timely diagnosis and treatment.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 89% of ECMO patients and 78% of the overall cohort, which is consistent with the findings by Andrea et al. [13] but exceeds the incidence reported in the ELSO registry [14]. The pathophysiology of AKI inLegionellapneumonia is multifactorial, involving intravascular volume depletion, rhabdomyolysis, endotoxemia, and possible interstitial nephritis [15,16]. In our cohort, the high prevalence of septic shock (66% among ECMO patients) likely played a central role in AKI development. Furthermore, renal replacement therapy (RRT) was used more frequently than reported by Andrea et al. [13], which may also reflect regional variation in CRRT initiation strategies [17]. Multiorgan dysfunction and hemolysis may have further contributed to the high rates of AKI and RRT use.

However, promising outcomes have been observed in patients requiring additional ECMO support, where mortality rates remain on par with the general cohort despite the greater severity of illness (e.g. more frequent septic shock) in these patients and are lower than or equal to published outcomes in the general ECMO-ARDS population.

Comparable studies have reported encouraging outcomes of ECMO in Legionella pneumonia [4,13]. However, our study adds important value through its binational, multicenter design, the inclusion of more severely ill patients, and the direct comparison between ECMO and non-ECMO patients.

Our data suggest that patients withLegionellapneumonia, ARDS, and even sepsis still have a relatively favorable prognosis, supporting the use of ECMO to support life-threatenig hypoxemia in this specific subgroup.

Therefore, ECMO should be considered as a potential rescue support option for patients with LP and severe acute respiratory failure.

Septic shock was defined according to the Sepsis-3 criteria [6].

AKI was defined and staged according to the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline [7]. For Fig.1, presence of at least stage 1 AKI was used for binary classification.

Liver injury was defined as serum aminotransferases > 3× upper limit of normal or bilirubin > 2 mg/dL (34 µmol/L), in line with established thresholds [8–10].

AdequateLegionella-specific coverage was defined as the administration of either a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin or clarithromycin), fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or doxycycline. These agents are recommended in current guidelines for empiric treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia with atypical pathogens, including Legionella spp [18].

Immunocompromise was defined as primary immunodeficiency, AIDS or use of immunosuppressive drugs (> 20 mg prednisolone equivalent per day for more than 2 weeks, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DM [19]) or cytotoxic drugs) [20].
