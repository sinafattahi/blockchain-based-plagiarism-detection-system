Organ preservation strategies like “watch-and-wait” are increasingly used in LARC patients
with cCR/near-cCR postneoadjuvant therapy1. Local recurrence remains critical, with 14.9–25% incidence within 2 years,
necessitating effective salvage interventions2. While endoscopic techniques provide super minimally invasive solutions for superficial
tumors3, the management of deep local recurrences involving or penetrating the muscularis
propria presents substantial challenges. We describe an innovative stepwise super minimally
invasive full-thickness resection (sft-SMIR) technique. A 75-year-old female presented with LARC
in the low rectum (initial staging: cT2–3N0M0). Following short-course radiotherapy and two
cycles of chemoradiotherapy, she achieved a near-clinical complete response (ncCR). After
multidisciplinary discussion, sft-SMIR surgery was performed (Fig. 1,Video 1). First, the laterally spreading tumor (LST) and scars after neoadjuvant therapy were
fully exposed, and the lesion area was marked (Fig. 1a, b). Second, ESD was performed in the LST and scar surrounding
areas (Fig. 1c). Third, a traction device of a rubber band and clips was
applied to fully expose the intrinsic muscle layer and deep scar areas at the lesion site. Then,
the intrinsic muscle layer was incised by an electric knife, and the extracellular mesorectum
was exposed (Fig. 1d). Fourth, the intrinsic muscle layer after ESD and the
full-thickness defect after EFTR were displayed (Fig. 1e). Finally, the closure of the full-thickness defect was
achieved by using clips to seal the muscle layer against the muscle layer (Fig. 1f). The specimen was fixed and photographed with both sides
(Fig. 1g, h). Postoperative pathology suggests intramucosal carcinoma
with curative resection.

Stepwise super minimally invasive full-thickness resection of LARC after neoadjuvant therapy.

The sft-SMIR technique (ESD-EFTR integration) provides a feasible, super-minimally invasive salvage strategy for patients with post-ncCR/cCR. By enabling endoscopically guided, precise full-thickness resection with controlled dissection, this approach effectively addresses deep muscularis propria involvement while substantially reducing unnecessary anal sphincter resection compared to traditional salvage surgery.
