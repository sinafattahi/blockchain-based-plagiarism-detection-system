Dyslipidemia as a modifiable risk factor for chronic non-communicable diseases has become a worldwide concern. We aim to explore different anthropometric measures as predictors of dyslipidemia using various machine learning methods.

From the baseline of the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) study, a total of 9,640 participants were included in the analysis. Among them, 1,388 participants did not have dyslipidemia, while 8,252 participants had dyslipidemia. Various anthropometric indices were examined, including waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body roundness index (BRI), abdominal volume index (AVI), weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), conicity index (C-index), body surface area (BSA), body adiposity index (BAI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). The association between these indices and dyslipidemia was assessed using logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), neural networks (NN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models.

Based on our LR model, we found that several factors included, BAI, BSA, age, and WHR were significant. For example, for each unit increase in WHR, the odds of dyslipidemia increase by 9 time (OR = 90.29, 95%CI (4.09,21.08)). Additionally, our DT model indicated that BMI was the most influential predictor, followed by age and WHR. The LR model outperforms other models with the highest accuracy (0.89) and AUC-ROC score (0.89), showing strong ability to classify dyslipidemia cases. Feature importance analysis reveals variables like “BSA” contribute differently across models, with XGBoost relying more on it than LR. LR’s balanced performance makes it the best choice.

The findings from machine learning models were in agreement, highlighting the significance of BMI, WHR, BSA, and BAI as key anthropometric indices for predicting dyslipidemia. These indices consistently emerged as strong predictors underscoring their importance in assessing the risk of dyslipidemia.

In recent decades, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a significant concern due to their increasing prevalence and their substantial contribution to mortality [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that each year, 41 million people die as a result of NCDs [2]. Obesity has been identified as a crucial factor underlying the development of NCDs. Excessive body fat is associated with hypertension and dyslipidemia, which, in turn, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes [3–5].

Dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), is a modifiable risk factor for NCDs [6]. It contributes to the progression and severity of NCDs through mechanisms such as plaque formation, elevated blood pressure, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines [7–9]. Many studies emphasize the importance of addressing dyslipidemia management as a potential preventive measure against NCDs in health policies [6,10]. While some studies suggest a possible association between anthropometric measures and dyslipidemia prediction, others argue that the relationship may not be linear [11–14].

The advancement of body analysis devices has significantly contributed to our understanding of body weight, as it has become evident that not all individuals with a body mass index (BMI) above the normal range are necessarily obese [15]. Athletes, for instance, may have a higher BMI due to increased muscle mass rather than excess body fat. Therefore, assessing the percentage of body fat mass is crucial in identifying individuals at risk of developing NCDs [16,17].

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) devices have been widely utilized for determining body composition by sending a weak electrical current through the body. It estimates fat, muscle, and water levels based on tissue conductivity (lean tissue conducts better than fat). While quick and convenient, results vary with hydration and other factors, making it better for tracking trends than precise measurements. Less accurate than DEXA but widely used in fitness and health screenings due to its affordability and ease of use [18]. However, there are certain challenges associated with their use. For instance, BIA devices have only been validated in specific populations, leading to reduced accuracy when used in other groups. Additionally, the availability of BIA devices in healthcare settings may be limited due to their cost [19].

Anthropometric measurements offer potential alternatives to BIA devices due to their affordability, ease of use, and shorter assessment time [20]. Changes in body weight led to rapid modifications in risk factors for NCDs, including blood pressure and lipid profiles [21,22]. While BMI and waist circumference (WC) are commonly used anthropometric measures for assessing body fat distribution, they fail to distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat, which is crucial in the development of NCDs like metabolic syndrome [23,24]. Therefore, anthropometric measures that incorporate the weight or circumference of specific body parts may better represent an individual’s risk for NCDs. Examples of such measures include waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body roundness index (BRI), body shape index (ABSI), abdominal volume index (AVI), weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), conicity index (C-index), body surface area (BSA), body adiposity index (BAI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) [25–30]. In this study, our objective is to examine whether these anthropometric measurements can serve as effective predictors of dyslipidemia in individuals using machine learning models.

This study included participants from the initial phase of the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) study, which is a cross-sectional study conducted in northeastern Iran [31]. A total of 1,388 participants were recruited, comprising individuals diagnosed with dyslipidemia as well as healthy individuals, as determined in the first phase of the cohort study. Participants were enrolled from three districts in Mashhad, each of which was subdivided into nine areas centered around Mashhad Healthcare Center divisions. The baseline investigation began in 2010, achieving a 79% response rate following stratified cluster random sampling. After identifying eligible subjects, we organized a meeting for physical examinations. The inclusion criteria included males and females aged between 35 and 65 years. Data from the Ministry of Health estimated the prevalence of dyslipidemias in the Mashhad population to be 85%. Consequently, a total of 9,704 individuals between the ages of 35 and 65 were initially enrolled. In all cases the percent of missing of model’s variables was less than 5%, so these cases were removed. Following data refinement (removing the missing data), 9,640 individual records were analyzed (refer to Fig.1). All participants provided written consent, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Blood samples were collected from participants between 8 and 10 a.m. after a 14-hour overnight fast through venipuncture of the antecubital vein. Vacuum tubes (20 ml) were used to collect the samples while participants were seated, following standard protocol. Within 30–45 min, all blood samples were centrifuged at room temperature to separate the serum from plasma into six aliquots of 0.5 ml each. These aliquots were then sent to the Bu Ali Research Institute in Mashhad, where they were stored frozen at −80 °C for future analysis. For contributors with serum triglycerides (TG) concentrations lower than 400 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald formula from TG, serum total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations expressed in mg/dl [32]. Dyslipidemia was defined as TC ≥ 200 mg/dl (5.18 mmol/l), LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/l), TG ≥ 150 mg/dl (1.69 mmol/l), or HDL-C < 40 mg/dl (1.03 mmol/l) in men and < 50 mg/dl (1.30 mmol/l) in women [33].

Anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, hip circumference (HC), waist circumference (WC), body roundness index (BRI), body adiposity index (BAI), body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were obtained by a registered nurse. Participants were asked to wear light clothing and no shoes for height and weight measurements. Smoking status was categorized as current smoker (smokes cigarettes daily), ex-smoker (previously smoked cigarettes daily but no longer does so), or non-smoker. Psychometric tests, including the Beck’s Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck’s Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), were conducted to assess anxiety and depression levels, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m). According to World Health Organization recommendations, a BMI ≥ 25-29.99 was classified as overweight, and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was categorized as obese [34].

The data analysis was conducted using the R Statistical Software (v4.1.2; R Core Team 2021), Python and IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 27). Continuous data were presented as mean ± SD, while categorical data were expressed as frequency (%). A significance level ofP< 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. For the comparison of continuous variables, t-tests were used, and for non-normal data, the Mann–Whitney test was employed to compare the means or medians of subjects with and without dyslipidemias. The chi-square test was used to investigate associations between categorical variables and the binary outcome, dyslipidemias. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using a holdout method, with a split of 75% for training and 25% for testing. To assess multicollinearity between independent variables, the variance inflation factor (VIF) and correlation coefficient calculations were utilized. Variables with a correlation greater than 0.7 were considered highly correlated, indicating a potential for multicollinearity.

The predictive ability of various anthropometric indices, including BMI, LAP, BRI, BSA, C-Index, WWI, and VAI (calculated using the formulas provided in Table1), to predict the presence of dyslipidemias was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

The association between anthropometric indices as variables and incident dyslipidemias was evaluated using logistic regression (LR), both in adjusted and crude models. Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals were computed based on these models. Model comparison and goodness-of-fit assessment were performed using the deviance as a likelihood ratio statistic and the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Lower AIC and deviance values indicate a better-fitting model with less error.

We employed machine learning techniques to analyze the data and construct a predictive model of anthropometric measurements using a decision tree (DT). The DT is a non-parametric method that derives its name from the nature of the target variable. The primary objective of a DT is to create a predictive model based on predictor variables.

DT algorithms employ splitting criteria at internal nodes [35]. The purpose of the splitting process is to minimize the impurity of each node. If a split does not result in any improvement in reducing impurity, the node remains unsplit and is referred to as a leaf node. However, if a split successfully reduces impurity, the split with the highest reduction in impurity is selected, and two branches are created, forming two new nodes. The Gini index is a commonly used criterion for determining the best splits in DTs.

The CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm is a DT algorithm that constructs a binary tree by utilizing the Gini index to determine the splitting variable at each internal node. The tree begins with all observations forming the root node, and subsequent splits determine the relative importance of predictor variables.

To assess the performance of the DT algorithm, ROC curves were employed to evaluate accuracy, precision, and specificity. The evaluation was conducted using R software version 4.0.5. Additionally, the confusion matrix of the DT was generated to further evaluate their performance.

We put the data into a data mining approach and the Neural Networks (NNs) was drawn to form a predictive model of Dyslipidemia measurements. NNs are a type of artificial intelligence that are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. NNs, particularly the multilayer perceptron network, are powerful tools for learning patterns and relationships in data. Their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships makes them useful in a wide range of applications [36]. In this paper, due to high computational load and preventing overfitting, we have limited the number of layers in the NN to a maximum of 5 layers. Additionally, we have divided the train and test data in a ratio of 75% and 25%, respectively. To implement the NN, we have used Python software and the confusion matrix of the neural net to evaluate the accuracy, precision, and specificity.

This study employed a random forest algorithm, an ensemble machine learning method that combines multiple decision trees to enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate overfitting. By leveraging feature bagging—where each tree is trained on a random subset of features—and aggregating predictions through majority voting (bagging), the model reduces variance and improves generalization [37,38]. Random forests are particularly advantageous for handling noisy or high-dimensional data while maintaining robustness against overfitting. The dataset was split into 75% training and 25% testing subsets, and the model was implemented in Python. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and specificity, were evaluated using a confusion matrix, with detailed results presented in the subsequent analysis.

This study utilized XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), an advanced ensemble learning algorithm known for its high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency [39,40]. Unlike traditional gradient boosting, XGBoost incorporates regularization techniques (L1/L2) to prevent overfitting and employs parallel tree construction for faster training. It also handles missing values natively and supports feature importance analysis, making it suitable for high-dimensional datasets [41]. The model was optimized via hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, tree depth, and subsampling) using cross-validation, following best practices in recent literature [40]. Implementation was performed in Python with performance evaluated through metrics such as AUC-ROC and F1-score, ensuring robustness in predictive modeling.

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a fundamental instance-based supervised learning method, was implemented in this study [42]. As a non-parametric and lazy learning approach, KNN classifies new data points based on the majority vote of their k most similar training samples in the feature space, where similarity is typically measured using Euclidean, Manhattan, or cosine distance metrics. The optimal value of k was determined through cross-validation to prevent overfitting while maintaining model generalization [43]. Key advantages of KNN include its inherent simplicity, absence of distributional assumptions, and natural adaptability to multi-class problems. However, to address its computational complexity with large datasets and sensitivity to feature scales, we applied data normalization techniques and feature selection prior to model training. Model performance was rigorously evaluated using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall, with comparative analysis against alternative machine learning approaches.

True Positives (TP): positive cases correctly identified as positive.

True Negatives (TN): negative cases correctly identified as negative.

False Positives (FP): negative cases incorrectly classified as positive (false alarms).

False Negatives (FN): positive cases incorrectly classified as negative (missed cases).

AUC-ROC: AUC is the area under the curve. Here, we calculate the area under the ROC curve. The higher the AUC (closer to 1), the better your model is at distinguishing between the two classes. An AUC of 0.5 means your model is no better than random guessing, and 0 means it is completely wrong (always flips positive and negative).

We utilize SHAP values to have integrated explanations between models. SHAP values borrow from game theory to explain how individual features contribute to a model’s prediction. Imagine each feature is a player in a team effort, and the prediction is the outcome. SHAP values calculate the average marginal contribution of each feature by considering all possible orders in which features are included in the model. This way, it assigns fair credit to each feature for its impact on the final prediction [45]. In the case of this paper, we use the SHAP python package to calculate the SHAP values of our features, and we can interpret them as the feature importance of a model. We also could use the legacy feature, which comes from some classical machine learning models, but in this way, we cannot have a balanced and fair comparison across different models.

Table1presents the characteristics of the study population, consisting of 9,640 eligible participants. Among them, 1,388 individuals did not have dyslipidemias, while 8,252 were diagnosed with dyslipidemias. In the group without dyslipidemias, 39% were male and 60% were female. The average age of the entire population was 48.08 ± 8.26 years. However, the average age of subjects with dyslipidemias was significantly higher than those without dyslipidemias (48.23 ± 8.20 vs. 47.17 ± 8.54 years). To compare the anthropometric and other variables between the two groups (with and without dyslipidemias), t-tests were used for continuous variables (assuming normal distribution), and chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. All variables showed significant differences between the two groups (P value < 0.001), except for BMI (P= 0.058).

Six data mining techniques, LR, XGBoost, RF, KNN, NN, and DT models, were employed to investigate the relationship between anthropometric predictors and the binary response variable (presence or absence of dyslipidemias). The primary objective of this study was to predict dyslipidemias using these models and identify associated factors, particularly anthropometric markers. For this purpose, the dataset was randomly split into two parts: a training dataset and a test dataset, with a split ratio of 25% for testing and 75% for training. The training dataset was used to develop these models, which was subsequently validated using the test dataset that had not been used during the training process.

The results of logistic regression model were presented in Table2. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using Quetelet’s index formula: BMI (kg/m²) = weight/height² [34]. The BMI values were categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria: underweight (< 18), normal weight [18–25], overweight [25–30], and obese (≥ 30) [46]. In this analysis, all anthropometric variables were included in the adjusted model, and non-significant variables were sequentially removed until only significant anthropometric variables remained. The models accounted for factors such as having BSA, WHR, age, category of BMI and category of BAI. In the model all variables were statistically significant (p< 0.05) and all VIF values were found to be less than 5, indicating no significant multicollinearity among variables. Based on the logistic model, WHR has been identified as significant variable. For each unit increase in WHR, the odds of dyslipidemia increase by 9 time (OR = 90.29, 95%CI (4.09,21.08)). Also, one unit increase in BSA the ratio of dyslipidemia was increases by 86% (OR = 1.86, 95%CI (1.16,2.98)). According to the odds ratio of body mass index (BMI), it has been observed that as the categories move to higher weight levels, the odds of developing dyslipidemia increase. The obese group has 86% higher odds of developing dyslipidemia compared to the normal group (OR = 1.83 95% CI (1.36,2.47)). The third category of BAI (32.79–37.48) has 69% higher odds of developing dyslipidemia compared to the first level (< 28.50) (OR = 1.69, 95% CI (1.37,2.09)). The accuracy of logistic regression in predict response was 89%.

The results of the DT training for anthropometric factors are depicted in Fig.2. The DT algorithm analyzed different risk factors associated with dyslipidemias and organized them into three layers. In the DT model (Table3), the first variable (root) holds the highest importance, with subsequent variables appearing in descending order of significance. As illustrated in Fig.2, BMI emerged as the most influential factor in determining the risk of dyslipidemias, followed by Age, and WHR. Among participants with BMI > = 31.60,91.70% were identified as having dyslipidemias, indicating the highest risk group. Conversely, among those with BMI < = 22.13, WHR < = 0.902, 36.7% were classified as non-dyslipidemias, signifying the lowest risk group. Detailed rules for dyslipidemias developed by the DT model are presented in Table4.

In this section, all variables of logistic regression were entered into the model to determine their significance. The Random Forest model results, with an accuracy of 96% where was greater than accuracy of LR, indicate that variables such as BSA and WHR have the greatest influence on dyslipidemia, implying that changes in these variables have the most significant impact on dyslipidemia levels. The mean drops in the Gini index used to build the decision trees in the Random Forest model indicates the relative relevance of the model’s effects on response, as shown in Table5. Additionally, the order of variable importance and the partial dependence of first and second significant variables in relation to the Random Forest are shown in Fig.3.

Based on the partial dependence plot (Fig.4), it can be deduced that a BSA value less than about 1.7 correlates with a greater odd of dyslipidemia levels and decreased in greater than 1.7. WHR is the second significant variable, a value less than approximately 1 suggests a increasing odds of having a dyslipidemia, whilst a value greater than 1 shows that the likelihood remains decreasing.

Based on the test metrics (Fig.5), the best model is Logistic Regression. It achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.89) and demonstrates a good balance between precision and recall for both No-dyslipidemias and dyslipidemias classes. Additionally, its AUC-ROC score (0.89) is the highest, indicating a strong ability to differentiate between No-dyslipidemias and dyslipidemias instances. While other models might have slight advantages in specific areas, Logistic Regression’s well-rounded performance across all metrics makes it the optimal choice for this task.

As it can be seen in Fig.1, we have the maximum correct (True Positive + True Negative) predictions in the Logistic Regression model and minimum wrong (False Positive + False Negative) predictions in the LR overall. It also confirms the AUC-ROC score result, which is maximum in the LR model.

The normalized feature importance table (Table6) summarizes each feature’s contribution to the prediction made by the different machine learning models used in this study. Feature importance scores quantify how much a specific feature influences the model’s output. Higher values indicate a greater influence on the model’s predictions. In our case, for example, the table shows that “BSA” has a higher SHAP importance score for the Logistic Regression model (5.443) than for the XGBoost model (3.573). This suggests that the XGBoost model relies more heavily on “BSA” when making predictions than the LR model.

MAC: Mid upper arm circumference; WHtR: Waist to height ratio; BRI: Body roundness index; AVI: Abdominal volume index; LAP: Lipid accumulation product; VAI: Visceral adiposity index; BSA: Body surface area; BAI: Body adiposity index; WHR: Waist-to-hip ratio; WC: Waist circumference; HC: Hip circumference; BMI: Body mass index.

Our study demonstrates an association of age, sex and advanced anthropometric indices including WHtR, BRI, ABSI, AVI, WWI, LAP, VAI, C-index, BSA, BAI, and WHR with the prediction of dyslipidemia. In this study, we employed DT and LR techniques to find the best-associated factors and enhance the accuracy of predictions. The LR model showed that the BMI, BAI, BSA, Age and WHR had significant association with the prediction of dyslipidemia while the DT model indicated that the BMI followed by BSA, BAI and WHR had a significant relationship.

An interesting finding from our LR analysis was that Body Surface Area (BSA) performed to be superior to BMI in the prediction of dyslipidemia. This can be justified that BSA is less influenced by abnormal fat mass and so it is a more accurate index of metabolic tissue than BMI [48]. Despite the lack of epidemiological evidence of BSA and dyslipidemia, a study has shown a positive association between BSA and TC, TG, LDL-C, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease [49]. More research is needed to understand the potential mechanisms behind this association and to provide further evidence.

According to our DT analysis, in the subgroup with BMI > = 24.314 kg/m2 and WHR > = 0.99, 94.23% of the participants developed dyslipidemia. Our LR model also showed that having a BMI greater than 30 (obesity) was the second most significant factor associated with the occurrence of dyslipidemia so for each unit increasing in BMI of obese people the chance of dyslipidemias incidence increases by 3.13 times. This result was in line with the study by Seo J et al. [50],who indicated that being obese had the utmost impact on the development of dyslipidemia through LR. In our study, the OR for BMI below 18 was 0.39. It means that a lower BMI value reduces the possibility of dyslipidemia. Consistent with our findings, in Saudi Arabian adolescents aged 10–19 years, the chance of developing dyslipidemia was 20% lower for those who were underweight [51]. But surprisingly, this is not always true. Sakamoto A et al. found men and women with a BMI lower than 18.5 kg/m2 had a significantly higher occurrence of elevated LDL-C levels compared to those who were overweight/obese (≥ 25.0 kg/m2) (P value < 0.0001 for both genders) [52]. So, we may conclude that being thin doesn’t mean having a healthy lifestyle [53]. BMI is not an accurate index of health conditions because it does not take into account body fat percentage, body fat distribution, lean body mass, age, gender, or other factors that may impact the relationship between weight and health [53,54].

Body Adiposity Index (BAI) also performed well in our results for the incidence of dyslipidemia. BAI estimates the percentage of fat tissue more precisely than BMI and it doesn’t need weight measurement. Despite this, an investigation found that the estimation of body fat percentage with BAI was not more precise than with BMI [55]. There are few studies that have investigated the predictive role of BAI in relation to dyslipidemia. However, a study noted that the BAI consistently had the weakest relationship with TG and HDL-C levels when both genders were considered together [56]. Arab Yousefabadi’s study underscore the significance of specific anthropometric indices in predicting lipid abnormalities. While our research highlights the importance of BMI, BAI, BSA, and WHR in relation to dyslipidemia, the Yousefabadi’s study emphasizes the predictive value of LAP and VAI for total cholesterol levels. These findings suggest that different anthropometric measures may offer varying predictive capabilities for lipid disorders, highlighting the need for tailored risk assessment tools in diverse populations [57].

Based on our LR and DT models, WHR (Waist to Hip Ratio) was another index that had significant relation to dyslipidemia prediction. A study in 2019 found WHR had the highest association coefficient out of all the measures including BMI, Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), and WC in the prediction of lipid concentration in Indian women [58]. The DT model in our study defined specific thresholds, such as BMI ≥ 24.314 and WHR ≥ 0.99, to identify the highest-risk group (94.23% diagnosed with dyslipidemias). The study of Takhttavous DT model incorporated thresholds for novel indices (e.g., VAI and LAP) to predict dyslipidemia over a 10-year period [59]. Moreover, another study noted WHR was the best predictor of dyslipidemia among WC, HC and BMI in Indian adults [60]. WHR can be considered a better predictor of metabolic complications than BMI because it is a more accurate indicator of central fat distribution [61]. However, there are conflicting opinions on whether WHR is a better predictor than WC [58,60,62,63].

It has long been recognized that aging is one of the utmost remarkable factors contributing to dyslipidemia [64]. But in our study, only in the LR model, age was a significant factor in the occurrence of dyslipidemia. Several studies indicated that as people age, there is an increase in TC, LDL-C, and TG levels [65,66]. Aging causes unwanted changes in body fat distribution. It leads to an increase in abdominal fat and a decrease in subcutaneous fat, making people more susceptible to metabolic diseases [67]. Some of the potential age-related mechanisms in the development of dyslipidemia with age are: (1) rising postprandial lipemia in the elderly, (2) increasing free fatty acid and insulin resistance, (3) reducing the secretion of growth hormones in both genders and sex hormones in men, (4) changing the endothelium of liver sinusoidal [66]. In our study, BMI had the highest odds ratio in LR (OR = 3.13 for obese individuals) and appeared as the root node in the DT model, indicating its central role in risk stratification. The Gutiérrez-Esparza study also emphasized BMI, categorizing individuals with higher BMI values as at greater risk for dyslipidemia. Both studies included anthropometric indices such as BMI, WHR, and BSA as significant predictors of dyslipidemia. These variables were important in identifying individuals at risk in both LR and DT models. Both studies identified specific thresholds for anthropometric variables. For example: in our study, BMI ≥ 24.314 and WHR ≥ 0.99 identified the highest-risk group. The Gutiérrez-Esparza article also defined personalized thresholds for predictors like BMI, WHR, and other anthropometric variables using machine learning algorithms. However, both studies split the dataset into training and test sets to ensure the generalizability of their models [68].

This study has a strong feature of using machine learning techniques to explore and predict the association of advanced anthropometric indices with dyslipidemia on a large scale of 9704 participants. However, our study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. One is that we did not take into account the genetic and epigenetic factors and family history of dyslipidemia in the participants. Second is that there is a significant difference between the number of men and women in dyslipidemia and non-dyslipidemia groups, which may influence the outcomes. The third is that we did not include people older than 65 and younger than 35 years old in our study.

In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of anthropometric measurements as effective predictors of dyslipidemia, a significant modifiable risk factor for NCDs. The findings emphasize the predictive value of indices such as BMI, BSA, BAI, and WHR. Among these, BMI was identified as the most influential factor, with obese individuals (BMI ≥ 30) showing a threefold increased risk of dyslipidemia compared to those with normal BMI. The LR models demonstrated that higher values of anthropometric indices were consistently associated with a greater likelihood of dyslipidemias. The DT model further supported these findings by identifying BMI and WHR as critical determinants, offering practical thresholds for stratifying individuals into high-risk and low-risk groups. For instance, participants with BMI ≥ 24.314 and WHR ≥ 0.99 were found to have a significantly higher likelihood of dyslipidemias (94.23%). This study underscores the utility of anthropometric measures as accessible, cost-effective tools for identifying individuals at risk of dyslipidemias, particularly in resource-limited settings where advanced body composition analysis devices may not be available. However, it is important to note that while these measures are valuable, they may not fully account for the complex interplay of other factors, such as genetic predispositions and lifestyle, which also contribute to dyslipidemia.

Future research should focus on incorporating additional variables, such as metabolic and lifestyle factors, into predictive models to enhance their accuracy and applicability. Longitudinal studies could also provide deeper insights into the dynamic relationship between anthropometric changes and dyslipidemia development over time. Such efforts would contribute to more effective prevention strategies for dyslipidemia and its associated NCDs, ultimately improving public health outcomes.
