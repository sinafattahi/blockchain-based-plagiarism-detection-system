Objective Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disease that increases the risk of fractures by weaking bone. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a crucial role in osteogenesis and osteoblastic differentiation. The purpose of this study is to examine the underlying mechanism of HIF-1α overexpression and its impact on osteoblast development. Methods First, we used the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA in conjunction with either a control lentivirus or an HIF-1α overexpression lentivirus to transfect rat osteoblasts in osteogenic induction media for 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. The effects of HIF-1α overexpression on osteogenic differentiation were evaluated using CCK-8, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and Alizarin Red staining. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism by which HIF-1α overexpression mediates autophagy to regulate osteogenic differentiation through immunofluorescence, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Ovariectomy (OVX) was performed to establish an osteoporotic rat model. The impact of HIF-1α overexpression on autophagy and bone metabolism was evaluated by locally injecting HIF-1α overexpression lentivirus or control lentivirus, in combination with HE staining, micro-CT, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Results Overexpression of HIF-1a promotes osteoblast proliferation and enhances ALP staining as well as calcium nodule formation. In addition, the overexpression of HIF-1a significantly increases the relative protein expression levels of osteocalcin (OCN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), HIF-1a, BNIP3, Beclin1, ATG5, and LC3 II/I. This indicates that HIF-1a may facilitate osteoblast differentiation by promoting autophagy. These findings were further corroborated by in vivo experiments, which demonstrated improved pathological morphology in rat femurs, alongside increased bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), bone volume/total volume ratio (BV/TV), and trabecular number (Tb. N). Additionally, there was a decrease in trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and structural model index (SMI), along with upregulated expression of OCN, OPG, HIF-1α, BNIP3, Beclin1, ATG5, and LC3 II. Conclusion HIF-1a overexpression can promote osteogenic differentiation and ameliorate osteoporosis through the induction of autophagy. These insights provide a valuable reference for its potential application in targeted therapy.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to compromised bone strength and an increased risk of fractures1. Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a prevalent subtype of primary osteoporosis, primarily attributed to the decline in estrogen levels following menopause in women2. Many currently available therapeutic agents for OP are associated with significant adverse effects or are not suitable for prolonged3. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying bone formation and resorption in order to identify more effective and safer therapeutic strategies for OP.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a (HIF-1a) is a highly conserved transcription factor that responds to hypoxic conditions by activating the expression of genes involved in cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels4. HIF-1a plays a crucial role in bone formation and osteogenic differentiation, acting as an important mediator of hypoxia-induced osteogenesis5,6. Studies have demonstrated that hypoxia can induce autophagy in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and enhance osteogenic differentiation7,8. HIF-1α is regulated by various factors, including hypoxia, cofactors, non-coding RNAs, and trace elements, and it modulates osteoblast differentiation through multiple signaling pathways.

Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles and misfolded proteins9. Accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important role in preserving bone metabolic balance. Dysregulation of autophagy disrupts the equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, thereby contributing to the development of bone disorders such as OP10,11. Hence, autophagy represents a critical regulatory mechanism in the pathogenesis of OP. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which autophagy influences OP remain incompletely understood.

Therefore, we hypothesized that HIF-1a may exert protective effects against OP by mediating autophagy to promote osteoblast differentiation. Based on in vivo and in vitro experiments, we investigated the role of HIF-1α overexpression in osteogenic differentiation through transfection with HIF-1α-overexpressing lentivirus or negative control lentivirus, in combination with treatment using the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. We further explored the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.

Rat osteoblasts (CP-R091, Procell, Wuhan, China) were first cultured in basal medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. When the cells reached 90% confluence, they were cultured using osteogenic induction medium supplemented with 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 nM dexamethasone to induce osteoblast differentiation. The medium was changed every 2 days.

Based on the sequence of rat HIF-1a (Gene ID: 29560), HIF-1a overexpressing lentivirus (ov-HIF-1a) and negative control lentivirus (ov-NC) were constructed. For transduction, rat osteoblasts were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105cells/well in 2 mL complete medium and cultured for 24 h to achieve 90% confluence 1 day prior to infection. After aspirating the original medium, cells were incubated with 2 mL fresh medium containing lentivirus at an optimized multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. Following 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, the viral suspension was replaced with 2 mL fresh medium. At 72 h post-transduction, fluorescence expression was assessed by microscopy, images were captured, and samples were harvested for downstream analyses.

The mRNA expression of HIF-1a was detected by qRT-PCR to verify the transfection efficiency. Total RNA was extracted from cells by Trizol method. RNA purity and concentration were determined. Subsequently, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and qPCR amplification was performed in triplicate. Amplification system: 0.4 µL lncRNA H19 upstream primer, 0.4 µL lncRNA H19 downstream primer, 1 µL cDNA template, 10 µL SYB Green, add distilled water to 20 µL. Amplification conditions: pre-denaturation at 94 ℃ for 1 min, 55 ℃ for 1 min, 72 ℃ for 1 min, extension at 72 ℃ for 5 min, 40 cycles, HIF-1a expression was calculated by 2−ΔΔCtmethod. The primer sequences were as follows: HIF-1a -F: CTATGTCGCTTTCTTGGA, HIF-1a -R: GTTTTCTGCTGCCTTGTAT; GAPDH -F: CAAGTTCAACGGCACAG, GAPDH -R: CCAGTAGACTCCACGACAT.

Cells were divided into the following four groups: Control (osteoblasts induced into osteogenic differentiation), ov-NC (transfection of negative control lentivirus in osteoblasts followed by induction of osteogenic differentiation), ov-HIF-1a (transfection of HIF-1a overexpressing lentivirus in osteoblasts followed by induction of osteogenic differentiation) and ov-HIF-1a + 3-MA [after transfection of HIF-1a overexpressing lentivirus in osteoblasts, 3-MA(1 mM, HY-19312, MCE) was added and treated for 1 h, then osteogenic differentiation was induced]. Each group of experiments should be conducted at least three independent biological replicates.

Cells were collected on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after osteogenic induction, and cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. The cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin (T1350, Solarbio) and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 10³ cells per well. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1% FBS, and 10 µL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.

Cells were collected on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after osteogenic induction, and osteogenic differentiation was assessed using ALP staining kit (G1481, Solarbio). The cell coverslips were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 95% ethanol for 5 min, and rinsed three times with distilled water. The incubation solution was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h, followed by rinsing with tap water. The cells were then treated with 2% cobalt nitrate for 3–5 min, washed three times with distilled water, reacted with 1% ammonium sulfide for 2 min, and rinsed with tap water before observation under a light microscope.

Alizarin red staining was carried out in accordance with the method described in the kit (C0148S, Beyotime). After osteoblast-induced differentiation for 3, 7, 14, and 21 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated with 2% alizarin red (ARS) solution for staining. The stained cells were observed and photographed under an optical microscope.

Immunofluorescence was used to detect the cellular localization of ATG5. The cells of each group cultured in 12-well plates were taken and washed twice with 1 mL PBS. Add 1mL of 4% paraformaldehyde to fix for 30 min at room temperature. Add 1mL of 0.5% Triton X-100 (T8210, Solarbio) room temperature permeabilization for 30 min. Add 1mL of 5% BSA and close at 37 °C for 1 h. Add primary antibody ATG5 (1:200,PAB36502, Bioswamp, Wuhan, China) at 4℃ and incubate overnight. Add secondary antibody (1:200,PAB36502, Bioswamp, Wuhan, China) at 37 °C and incubate for 1 h. Add 300 µL of anti-fluorescence quenching blocking solution (containing DAPI). Photographs were taken under fluorescence microscope observation.

Take 1 × 10⁷ cells and perform pre-fixation with 2 mL of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, followed by fixation with 1% osmium acid. After dehydration, infiltration, and embedding, section the sample into 60 nm slices. Stain with uranyl acetate for 10–15 min, then with lead citrate for 1–2 min. Finally, use a transmission electron microscope to collect images from the copper grid.

Protein quantification was performed using the BAC protein quantification kit. By SDS-gel electrophoresis, membrane transfer, and confined, diluted primary antibodies OCN (1:1000,PAB39029, Bioswamp), OPG (1:1000,PAB33195, Bioswamp), HIF-1a (1:1000, NB100-105SS, Bioswamp), BNIP3(1:1000,PAB34169, Bioswamp), Beclin1 (1:1000,PAB47943, Bioswamp), ATG5 (1:1000,PAB36502, Bioswamp), LC3II/I (1:1000,PAB34124, Bioswamp), and GAPDH (1:1000,PAB36269, Bioswamp) were added, and the dilution ratios were all 1:1000, and incubated at 4℃ overnight. Add secondary antibody Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:20,000,SAB43714, Bioswamp) and incubate for 2–3 h at room temperature. The ECL chemiluminescence development kit was developed and photographed with a gel imager to analyze the gray value. All WB data were normalized with GAPDH as the internal reference. The relative expression level of the target protein = the band density of the target protein/the corresponding band density of GAPDH.

Twenty-four female SD rats (8-week-old, SPF-grade) were purchased from Hunan Slaughter Kingda Laboratory Animal Co. Ovariectomy (OVX) was performed to establish an osteoporotic rat model. After anesthesia, the rats were fixed on the operating table with limbs and head lying supine. A median abdominal incision was made with scissors to expose the ovaries, and bilateral ovary removal surgery was performed with hemostatic cotton to stop the bleeding, which was completed with sutures and sterilized with iodophor. Penicillin sodium (40,000 u/d) was administered intramuscularly in the thigh for 3 d consecutive postoperatively. After 8 weeks of osteoporosis development, rats were randomized into the following four groups: sham (exposure of the ovaries and excision of an equal volume of fat around the ovaries), model (ovaries were removed, and after 8 weeks of feeding, equal doses of saline were injected into the tail vein every two weeks for 4 weeks), ov-NC (ovaries were removed, and after 8 weeks of feeding, 15 µL negative control lentivirus was injected into the tail vein every two weeks for 4 weeks), and ov- HIF-1a (ovaries were removed, and after 8 weeks of feeding, 15 µL HIF-1a overexpressing lentivirus was injected into the tail vein every two weeks for 4 weeks). At week 13, the serum was collected, and then the rats were anesthetized and killed with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and the femoral and tibial tissues from both sides were collected. All procedures were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (YJSDW2022-069) and conducted in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

The rat femoral was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then the tissue was dehydrated and paraffin-embedded, and the section thickness was 4.5 μm. The slices were deparaffinized, dehydrated by ethanol gradient, stained with HE staining, and transparently sealed, and the structure of the bone tissue was observed under the microscope.

Take the rat femur and fix it in a 4% formaldehyde solution for 24 h. Perform Micro-CT (Quantum GX, PerkinElmer, USA) scanning. After the machine is preheated, place the sample to be tested and adjust it to the target region. Scanning area: Secondary cancellous bone region at the distal end of the femur, starting 1 mm from the distal end of the growth plate and extending 2 mm towards the diaphysis (a total height of 3 mm), avoiding interference from the growth plate. Measure bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and structural model index (SMI).

Expression of the autophagy marker LC3 II in femoral tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. The fixed femoral tibial tissue was embedded in wax by dehydration and immersion in the usual steps. Paraffin sections were dewaxed, dehydrated, repaired with high-temperature antigen, serum blocked, and incubated with primary antibody LC3 II (1:400) at 4 ℃ overnight. Add the secondary antibody and incubate at 37 ℃ for 1 h, dropwise add DAB color development solution, hematoxylin re-staining, dehydration, transparent sealing, and observe the staining under the microscope.

Serum expression of bone formation-associated bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP, RA20178, Bioswamp), precollagen amino-terminal prepeptide (PINP, RA20172, Bioswamp) and bone resorption-associated anti-tartaric acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b, RA20388, Bioswamp), and human type I collagen carboxy-terminal cross-linking peptide (CTX-I, RA20168, Bioswamp) were measured by ELISA.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x̄ ± s), and each independent experiment was repeated three times. The t-test was used for comparisons between two sample means, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for multiple samples mean comparisons, and the Tukey’s multiple comparisions test was used for pairwise comparisons among multiple sample means. A value ofP< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

First, we verified the transfection efficiency of HIF-1a overexpression lentiviral vector. Compared with the ov-NC group, the expression of HIF-1a in cells in the ov-HIF-1a group was significantly increased (P= 0.0003, Fig.1A). This result suggests that HIF-1a overexpression lentivirus was successfully constructed. Next, we collected cells at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after osteogenic induction for detection. Compared with the ov-NC group, the proliferation ability of cells in the ov-HIF-1a group at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days were significantly increased (P<0.0001;P<0.0001;P<0.0001;P<0.0001). Compared with the ov-HIF-1a group, the proliferation ability of cells in the ov-HIF-1a + 3-MA group was reduced to some extent at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days (P<0.0001;P<0.0001;P<0.0001;P<0.0001; Fig.1B). ALP staining found that ov-HIF-1a could enhance ALP staining in osteoblasts at 7, 14, and 21 days (P<0.0001 vs. ov-NC), while 3-MA could weaken ALP staining (P<0.0001 vs. ov-HIF-1a, Fig.1C). Similarly, alizarin red staining found that cells in the ov-HIF-1a group appeared obvious red nodules at 14 and 21 days (P<0.0001 vs. ov-NC),, and 3-MA could inhibit the red nodules (P<0.0001 vs. ov-HIF-1a, Fig.1D). We concluded that HIF-1a overexpression may promote osteoblast differentiation, while 3-MA can inhibit osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, we therefore chose to induce osteoblasts with ov-HIF-1a for 14 days for subsequent experiments.

We detected the expression of ATG5 in cells by immunofluorescence. The immunofluorescence intensity of ATG5 was stronger in cells in the ov-HIF-1a group (P<0.0001 vs. ov-NC), while it was weaker in cells in the ov-HIF-1a + 3-MA group (P<0.0001 vs. ov-HIF-1a, Fig.2). Meanwhile, the ov-HIF-1a group promoted the formation of autophagosomes in osteoblasts compared with the ov-NC group. Compared with the ov-HIF-1a group, the ov-HIF-1a + 3-MA group inhibited the formation of autophagosomes (Fig.3A). In addition, the relative protein expressions of OCN (P<0.0001), OPG (P= 0.0007), HIF-1a (P<0.0001), BNIP3 (P= 0.0094), Beclin1 (P= 0.0433), ATG5 (P= 0.0003), and LC3 II/I (P<0.0001) were significantly up-regulated in the cells of the ov-HIF-1a group compared with the ov-NC group. The relative protein expressions of OCN (P<0.0001), OPG (P<0.0001), HIF-1a (P= 0.0074), BNIP3 (P= 0.0003), Beclin1 (P= 0.0008), ATG5 (P<0.0001), and LC3 II/I (P<0.0001) were significantly down-regulated in cells of the ov-HIF-1a + 3-MA group compared with the ov-HIF-1a group (Fig.3B). This result suggests that overexpression of HIF-1a promotes osteoblast differentiation and autophagy levels, while 3-MA inhibits autophagy levels and suppresses osteoblast differentiation.

HE staining revealed that the bone trabeculae in the Sham group were dense and well-aligned. Bone trabeculae in the model and ov-NC groups were sparse, thinned, broken and disorganized. The structure of ov-HIF-1a bone trabeculae was significantly improved (Fig.4A). In addition, Micro-CT results showed that BMD (P= 0.0008), Tb.Th (P= 0.0085), BV/TV (P<0.0001) and Tb.N (P<0.0001) were significantly decreased and Tb.Sp (P= 0.0005) and SMI (P= 0.0075) were significantly increased in the model group of rats when compared with the Sham group. Compared with the ov-NC group, BMD (P= 0.0266), Tb.Th (P= 0.0475), BV/TV (P<0.0001) Tb.N (P<=0.0120) were significantly increased and Tb.Sp (P= 0.0467) and SMI (P= 0.0431) were significantly decreased in the ov-HIF-1a group (Fig.4B-C). This result suggests that removal of rat ovaries can significantly destroy bone structure. While HIF-1a overexpression improved the bone structure in rats.

The expression of LC3 II was significantly reduced in the cells of rats in the model group compared with the Sham group (P<0.0001). The expression of LC3 II was increased in rat cells in the ov-HIF-1a group compared with the ov-NC (P= 0.0193, Fig.5A). Meanwhile, the relative protein expressions of OCN (P<0.0001), OPG (P<0.0001), HIF-1a (P= 0.0002), BNIP3 (P<0.0001), Beclin1 (P<0.0001), ATG5 (P<0.0001) and LC3 II/I (P<0.0001) were significantly down-regulated in the cells of rats in the model group compared with the Sham group. The relative protein expressions of OCN (P<0.0001), OPG (P<0.0001), HIF-1a (P<0.0001), BNIP3 (P= 0.0003), Beclin1 (P= 0.0026), ATG5 (P= 0.0038), and LC3 II/I (P= 0.0470) were significantly upregulated in rat cells of the ov-HIF-1a group compared with the ov-NC group (Fig.5B). In addition, we detected bone metabolism marker expression in serum by ELISA (Fig.5C). Compared with the Sham group, the serum levels of BALP (P<0.0001) and PINP (P<0.0001) were significantly decreased and the levels of TRACP-5B (P<0.0001) and CTX-I (P<0.0001) were significantly increased in the model group of rats. Compared with the ov-NC group, the serum levels of BALP (P<0.0001) and PINP (P<0.0001) were significantly increased and the levels of TRACP-5B (P<0.0001) and CTX-I (P<0.0001) were significantly decreased in the ov-HIF-1a group of rats. This result suggests that overexpression of HIF-1a promotes cellular autophagy and osteoblast differentiation and enhances bone metabolism in rats.

PMOP is a systemic bone disease associated with menopause-associated estrogen withdrawal characterized by low bone mass, deterioration of skeletal microarchitecture, and increased susceptibility to subsequent fragility fractures, leading to disability and death2,12. Currently, traditional anti-osteoporosis drugs have some efficacy, but they have various side effects. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the pathogenesis of PMOP and find more effective therapeutic agents. In the present study, we jointly verified by in vivo and in vitro experiments that HIF-1a overexpression was able to promote osteoblast proliferation by inducing autophagy and ameliorate the improvement of pathological morphology in the tibial femur of rats.

HIF-1a is a target of hypoxia, cofactor activity, non-coding RNA, trace elements, and many other factors. HIF-1a is highly expressed in hypoxic environments13. Recently, it has been found that HIF-1a also plays an important role in cell survival in normoxic environments, regulating target gene expression to control cellular metabolism14. One study found that activation of HIF-1a promotes bone regeneration15. Xu et al.16found that HIF-1a was able to regulate glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis through the PDK1/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. HIF-1a regulates bone homeostasis and plays a crucial role in the prevention of bone metabolic diseases17. In this study, overexpression of HIF-1a promoted cellular ALP activity as well as calcium nodule formation. In animal experiments, we obtained the same results, showing an improvement in the pathomorphology of the rat femoral, an increase in BMD, Tb.Th, BV/TV, Tb.N, BALP, and PINP, and a decrease in Tb.Sp, SMI, TRACP-5B, and CTX-I. This is similar to the results of previous studies. Roxadustat, as a novel HIF stabilizer, significantly increased the intensity of ALP staining, enhanced matrix mineralization, and up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of osteogenic markers in osteoblasts in cellular assays; in vivo, Roxadustat could promote bone formation and inhibit bone resorption by up-regulating the protein expression levels of osteogenic markers in bone tissues of ovariectomized (OVX) rats, ameliorate the deterioration of bone microarchitecture, and attenuate the bone loss in OVX rats18.

One study found that osteoblast autophagy levels were reduced in the OP rat model19. Autophagy-related gene (ATG) protein family regulates autophagosome formation20. Autophagy and autophagy-related proteins play key roles in osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption and maintenance of bone homeostasis21. Therefore, we hypothesized that the role of HIF-1a in osteoblast differentiation might be related to autophagy. We further validated this by introducing 3-MA in cellular experiments. The results revealed that 3-MA significantly inhibited ALP staining as well as calcium nodule formation. And overexpression of HIF-1a reversed the effect of 3-MA on osteoblasts, which was manifested by increasing the formation of osteoblast markers and promoting osteoblast differentiation. In addition, we found that overexpression of HIF-1a promoted autophagy in osteoblasts and obtained the same results in in vivo experiments, as evidenced by an increase in LC3II and ATG5 expression. Autophagy has been found to maintain the function of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and ameliorate osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency22. Vakili S et al.23found that quercetin and vitamin E attenuated ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis through autophagy in rat osteoblasts. Zheng et al.24found that the natural product ursolic acid can target autophagy to combat osteoporosis. Thus, there have been a large number of studies demonstrating the relationship between autophagy and osteoporosis25. Our findings are similar in that HIF-1a overexpression promotes osteoblast differentiation through activation of autophagy to alleviate osteoporosis.

However, the mechanism by which HIF-1a regulates the coupling of autophagy and osteogenesis remains to be further clarified. The interaction between HIF-1a and autophagy may be direct, which needs to be confirmed in combination with gene knockout (such as siRNA for ATG5 or Beclin1). or use autophagy flux indicators (e.g., bafilomycin A1) or LC3 turnover assays to support the conclusions. Meanwhile, its relationship of action may also be indirect. For instance, studies have shown that HIF-1a may indirectly affect autophagy by transcriptional regulation of BNIP326,28or AMPK29etc. Further research will be conducted in the future.

In conclusion, this study clarified the role of HIF-1a in PMOP and explored its possible mechanism. In vitro experiments have verified that overexpression of HIF-1a can increase ALP staining, calcium nodule formation, and the formation of osteoblast markers, and promote osteoblast differentiation. Through in vivo experiments, we obtained the same results, which were specifically reflected in the improvement of the pathological morphology of the femur and the differentiation of osteoblasts. Exploring the mechanism found that HIF-1a overexpression promotes osteogenic differentiation and improves osteoporosis through autophagy. Our study provides a certain reference basis for targeted treatment of OP. There are still some shortcomings in this experiment. We did not collect clinical samples for testing. In future research, we will further verify this through clinical trials.
