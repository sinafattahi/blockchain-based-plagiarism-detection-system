Fear learning and generalization is one of the postulated transdiagnostic processes linking childhood adversity to psychopathology. However, limited studies have investigated the processes in the context of childhood adversity, especially in youths with emerging psychiatric symptoms, although adolescence and young adulthood are critical periods when psychopathology most often emerges.

Twenty-six adversity-exposed youths (aged 17–24 years old) with (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms (scoring above the predefined cut-off of at least two symptom dimensions of depression, anxiety and psychosis) and 29 healthy controls (no history of adversity), underwent a fear learning and generalization paradigm. Fear responses were assessed using risk ratings and reaction times.

During fear acquisition, the adversity group showed reduced threat-safety discrimination (quantified as the difference score between the danger and the safety cue). Contrary to our hypothesis, this effect was driven by their enhanced risk ratings for the safety cue rather than blunted responses to the danger cue. Dimensional analysis further revealed that higher levels of childhood adversity were associated with relatively enhanced risk ratings for the safety cue as compared to the danger cue, an effect that persisted after controlling for current psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety and psychosis). During fear generalization, the generalization gradient in the adversity group did not differ from the control group. However, adversity-exposed youths reported generally enhanced risk ratings across stimuli, suggesting quantitatively altered responses (similar, but upward shifted gradient). While dimensional analysis linked the generally enhanced risk ratings to higher levels of childhood adversity, this association did not survive correction for psychiatric symptoms.

The observed enhanced responses for the safety cue during acquisition and the generally enhanced responses during generalization are similar as those observed in patients with a diagnosable psychiatric disorder in prior studies. This suggests that the observed pattern may reflect an adversity-related vulnerability for further progression to psychopathology in this population.

Childhood adversity (CA) encompasses negative environmental experiences, such as abuse, neglect, domestic violence, and peer and sibling victimization. Exposure to CA extensively links to the development of psychopathology across traditional diagnoses [1], with evidence pointing to comorbid symptom clusters, particularly the mixture of depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms, which already present at the early stage of psychopathology [2]. Some of the postulated transdiagnostic etiological processes are (i) fear learning, a process through which a neutral stimulus is learned as a signal of an aversive event and can itself elicit fear, and (ii) fear generalization, a process through which the learned fear is transferred to novel stimuli similar to the learned stimuli [3]. Fear learning and fear generalization are fundamentally adaptive since they allow us to rapidly identify environmental threats and respond to them. However, they can become maladaptive if fear persists in the presence of objectively safe situations. In laboratory studies, these processes can be measured using a classical fear conditioning paradigm [4]. During acquisition, a neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) and thus becomes a conditioned danger cue (CS+), while another neutral stimulus is never paired with the US and thus becomes a conditioned safety cue (CS–). To assess generalization, typically, the learned CS + and CS– and a series of novel stimuli with perceptual similarity to the CS + and CS– are presented to assess the degree of acquired (generalized) fear to those new stimuli.

Aberrant fear learning has been reported in individuals exposed to adversity and in those presenting psychopathology, but the patterns seem to diverge. With regard to psychopathology, a meta-analysis of anxiety-related disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social phobia (SP), panic disorder (PD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), found that patients successfully learned the CS+ - US contingency, but they showed enhanced fear responses to the CS– relative to healthy controls [5]. This indicates that patients with anxiety disorders tend to generalize fear responses to safe stimuli and/or are less able to inhibit their fear to safety cues in an aversive context. A similarly increased fear response to the CS– has also been observed in patients with schizophrenia relative to controls in pooled data [6]. Pertaining to childhood adversity, however, a recent systematic review (with most of the included studies conducted in non-clinical samples) [7] reveals blunted responses to the CS+, resulting in reduced CS discrimination, a finding which has recently been validated in a large sample of exposed but mentally healthy adults [8]. The blunted responses to the CS + were also observed in exposed, healthy children and adolescents (6–18 years) [9]. The strikingly opposite patterns in psychopathology and in the context of childhood adversity warrant further research, especially since CA is a strong and robust risk factor for the development of psychopathology [1,10]. Investigating the status of fear learning in exposed individuals during a potential transition stage to psychopathology, i.e. those with emerging symptoms, may shed light on this question. Furthermore, there are still limited studies that have examined how exposure to childhood adversity may impact fear learning [11], especially in late adolescents and young adults, a phase marked by emerging psychopathology [12] as well as significant neural, cognitive, and emotional changes.

In addition to fear learning, altered fear generalization has also been observed across anxiety-related disorders [13,14], while only few studies have been conducted in the context of CA [8,15,16]. A meta-analysis [13] of 16 studies reporting behavioural fear generalization measures suggested greater generalization in individuals with (sub-)clinical anxiety-related disorders, including PTSD, GAD, PD, SP, OCD and social anxiety disorder (SAD), relative to healthy controls. Moreover, the only study in schizophrenia [17] demonstrated an undergeneralization in individuals with nonaffective psychotic disorder relative to healthy controls. Pertaining to CA, the few studies that have been conducted [8,16] did not suggest adversity-related overgeneralization. For instance, Thome and colleagues [16] found that PTSD adults did report heightened shock expectancy across stimuli relative to healthy controls, whereas trauma controls (mentally healthy with a history of repeated childhood abuse) reported similar expectancy relative to healthy controls. Likewise, Klingelhöfer-Jens and colleagues [8] found comparable generalization gradients between healthy adults with and without CA.

Against this background, the current study investigates both fear learning and fear generalization in a youth group, aged 17–24 years, who experienced CA and who present (sub-)clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or psychosis, as compared to a healthy control group with no history of CA. Based on previous studies in adversity [8,9], we hypothesized to observe decreased threat-safety discrimination during fear learning which would mainly be driven by blunted responses to the CS + in relation to adversity. For fear generalization, we hypothesized to see similar generalization gradients between exposed individuals and healthy controls.

Youth aged 17–24 years were recruited through posters and flyers distributed in leisure centres, schools, medical practices, health centres and specialized centres providing care for youth. A childhood adversity (CA) group (n= 27) was established, comprising youth exposed to CA who exhibited psychiatric symptoms (scoring above predefined cut-offs) in at least two domains of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. This grouping reflects the established association between CA and the co-occurrence of these symptoms [2]. A healthy control group (HC,n= 30) comprised participants with no history of childhood adversity (CA) and subthreshold scores across all three symptom measures. Exclusion criteria included medical and neurological illnesses, current use of psychiatric medication, current substance abuse, autism spectrum disorder, and mental retardation. All participants -and when below 18 years, one of their legal guardians- signed an informed consent conform to the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) before inclusion. This study was conducted as part of ENGAGE, a multimodal investigation examining how childhood adversity affects socio-emotional processing in youth and the potential benefits of exercise intervention. Participants received €60 compensation plus travel expense reimbursement.

Exposure to childhood adversity was measured using a modified version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire 2nd revision (Adult Retrospective Form; JVQ-R2; [18]), supplemented with five emotional neglect items from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; [19]) to cover gaps in the original measure. The final adapted JVQ-R2 comprised 33 items assessing seven childhood adversity categories: physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, domestic violence and peer and sibling victimization/bullying. All screening questions were translated into Dutch and featured dichotomous (yes/no) response options. For affirmative responses, the frequency was examined (1 = once, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often). CA group inclusion required meeting any of these criteria: (1) endorsing ≥ 1 item (frequency ≥ 3 [sometimes]) in domestic violence, peer/sibling victimization, or emotional abuse categories; (2) affirming ≥ 1 item (any frequency) in physical neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, or sexual abuse categories; or (3) reporting ≥ 1 specific emotional abuse item (“At any time in your life, did you get scared or feel really bad because grown-ups in your life called you names, said mean things to you, or said they didn’t want you?”) or sexual abuse items (“Did anyone ever force you to look at his or her intimate parts by forcing or surprising you or by suddenly showing you?”, “Did anybody ever hurt your feelings by saying or writing something sexual about you or your body?”) with frequency ≥ 3 [sometimes]. These criteria followed Croft and colleagues’ [20] methodology. During the test session, participants completed a detailed semi-structured interview to reassess endorsement and frequency of adverse events, along with the age of onset, duration, and past and present impact (not analyzed here). A continuous adversity variable was then calculated by averaging the mean frequency scores across all seven adversity categories from the modified JVQ-R2 interview, providing a quantitative measure of individual exposure differences.

Clinically relevant depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms were assessed using standardized measures with validated cut-offs: the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; score ≥ 11) [21,22], the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T; score ≥ 40) [23–25] and the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 version (PQ-16; symptom scale ≥ 5 or distress scale ≥ 8) [26], respectively. Inclusion in the CA group required meeting threshold criteria in ≥ 2 symptom domains, while HC participants scored below all thresholds. Current symptom severity was evaluated during the test session to capture recent symptom status.

We administered a classic fear learning and fear generalization task [4]. Ten circles (i.e. circle 1 to 10) of gradually increasing size (from 2 to 4.7 inches, with every circle 15% larger than the previous one) served as visual stimuli. Circle 3 and 8 served as the conditioned stimuli (CSs) during the acquisition phase, i.e. as either the danger stimulus (CS+) or the safety stimulus (CS–), counterbalanced between participants (condition 0 or 1), while the other 8 circles served as the generalization stimuli (GSs) during the generalization phase. A mild electric shock served as the unconditioned stimulus (US) and was administered to the non-dominant wrist of each participant using a DS7A electrical stimulator (Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, UK). Shock intensity was determined using a work-up procedure for each participant, during which participants received a series of shocks and rated each on a scale ranging from 1 (barely felt) to 5 (very unpleasant). The initial shock started at 2 mA and increased 2 mA increments in a stepwise fashion until a rating of 4 (unpleasant, but not painful) was reached. The maximum intensity was 24 mA and was used if ratings did not reach 4.

The paradigm was programmed in Python using the PsychoPy package [27,28]. For each trial, a fixation cross was first presented for 1 s in the middle of the screen, followed by the visual stimulus (i.e. one of the 10 circles) shown for 8 s. Two seconds after stimulus onset, participants provided risk ratings (i.e., US expectancy) for each cue using a 10-point Likert scale displayed below it (1 = “definitely no shock” to 10 = “definitely a shock”). They were instructed to predict electrical stimulus occurrence as accurately as possible by selecting their response using left/right arrow keys, with the cursor initially positioned at the scale’s midpoint. The risk rating scale disappeared as soon as participants selected and confirmed their responses or, in case of a non-response, at stimulus offset. Both the risk ratings and reaction times (RT; indicating participants’ uncertainty to achieve the judgement [29]) were used to characterize participants’ responses. The intertrial interval varied between 2.2 s and 3.2 s, with an average interval of 2.45 s. All trials were semi-randomized with maximally two identical trials in a row. To measure fear-potentiated startle responses (FPS), an acoustic startle probe (i.e. 40-ms bursts of 95 dB white noise) was presented 0.5 s after stimulus onset in half of the trials for each stimulus type, which was semi-randomized.

During preacquisition phase, the CS + and CS– were shown four times each and they were never followed by the US during this phase. During the acquisition phase, the CS + and CS– were shown eight times each, with CS + paired to a 100 ms electric shock (i.e. the US) immediately after stimulus offset, at a 75% reinforcement rate. CS– was never followed by the US. During the generalization phase, all 10 stimuli were shown, with CS + and CS– eight times each and the eight GSs four times each. The CS + was followed by the US with a 50% reinforcement rate and the CS– and GSs were never followed by the US. All trials were semi-randomized and clustered within four blocks consisting of 12 trials (2 CS+, 2 CS– and 1 of every GS). During data analyses, the original eight GSs were clustered into four generalization stimuli (see Fig.1) following previous studies [4,30].

After the generalization phase, participants were verbally questioned about their awareness of the CS-US contingency, which was written down and then classified and coded as unaware, uncertain or aware during data analyses by two researchers. Additionally, participants completed the post-experiment ratings and the perceptual discrimination task (Supplementary Methods and Results).

Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) were implemented using thelmerTestpackage (v3.1-3) [31], inRstudio(v 4.1.3) [32]. For each task phase (preacquisition, acquisition, and generalization), we fitted separate models with participant-level random intercepts for both outcome variables (risk ratings and response times). Due to technical issues (i.e. many triggers were either not correctly recorded or lost), however, not enough valid physiological data could be yielded and thus excluded from analyses. Age, sex and CS + assignment condition (whether circle 3 or 8 served as the CS+) were included as covariates if their effects were significant. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted using t-tests with Tukey-adjusted p-values with theemmeanspackage (v1.7-3) [33].

During preacquisition phase modeling, we examined a three-way group (CA vs. HC) × stimulus (CS + vs. CS–) × trial interaction.

The acquisition phase analysis followed a sequential approach. First, discrimination learning was evaluated by computing difference scores (CS + minus CS– fear responses) [5], with group comparisons conducted via independent samples t-tests. Next, linear mixed models were fitted to test the three-way interaction between group (CA vs. HC), stimulus (CS + vs. CS–) and trial. For models revealing a significant group × stimulus interaction or a main effect of group, follow-up analyses within the CA group examined the effects of childhood adversity (as a continuous variable), testing either its interaction with stimulus (adversity × stimulus) or its main effect across stimuli, while accounting for trial. These within-CA models were then repeated with symptoms covariates (depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms) to determine whether adversity effects were independent of current symptomatology. All continuous predictors were standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 prior to analysis.

The extent of generalization was initially quantified using linear departure scores (LDS = [mean(generalization stimuli) - mean(CS+, CS–)] [14]), with group comparisons conducted via independent t-tests. Next, linear mixed models were fitted to examine the effect of group (CA vs. HC) × stimulus (CS+, CS–, GS1, GS2, GS3, GS4) × trial. For models revealing a significant group × stimulus interaction or a main effect of group, follow-up analyses within the CA group examined the effect of childhood adversity (as a continuous variable), testing either its interaction with stimulus (adversity× stimulus) or its main effect across stimuli, while accounting for trial. These within-CA models were then repeated with symptoms covariates (depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms) to determine whether adversity effects were independent of current symptomatology. All continuous variables were standardized (M = 0, SD = 1). To account for potential influence of perceptual discrimination abilities on fear generalization, exploratory analyses adjusting for individual differences in perceptual discrimination were conducted (see Supplement).

Demographic information is summarized in Table1. One exposed participant was excluded due to more than 50% trials with missing values for the fear conditioning task, resulting in 26 participants in the CA group. One control participant was excluded due to no response during acquisition phase, resulting in 29 participants in the HC group. The selected US intensity was on average 14.62 mA (SD = 5.37) in the HC group and 13.46 mA (SD = 7.03) in the CA group and there was no significant group difference (p=.493). The majority of participants verbally reported the awareness of CS-US contingency (61.82% aware, 18.18% uncertain, 20% unaware) after the generalization phase and there was no significant group difference (p=.053).

There was a main effect of trial (F(1,360)= 5.36,p=.021,η²= 0.01), with higher risk ratings as more trials were administered, and of age (F(1,52)= 14.06,p<.001,η²= 0.04), with older participants tending to report lower risk ratings. There was no main effect of stimulus and group, nor was there a significant interaction effect between stimulus × group, stimulus × trial, group × trial, or stimulus × group × trial (allp>.08).

CS discrimination score was lower in the CA group relative to the HC group (MCA= 3.41,MHC= 4.87,t(53)= 2.73,p=.009, d = 0.74), indicating a lower ability to discriminate CS + and CS– in exposed individuals. Results of linear mixed models revealed this decreased threat-safety discrimination was mainly driven by increased risk ratings for CS– in the CA group. Specifically, there was a main effect of stimulus (F(1,819)= 37.13,p<.001,η²= 0.04) and of group (F(1,191)= 4.54,p=.034,η²= 0.01), and a significant stimulus by group interaction effect (F(1,819)= 6.14,p=.013,η²= 0.01): while both groups reported higher risk ratings for CS + relative to CS–, exposed participants reported higher risk ratings for CS– relative to controls (Fig.2A). Additionally, there was a main effect of trial (F(1,808)= 6.06,p=.014,η²= 0.01) and a stimulus by trial interaction effect (F(1,823)= 140.63,p<.001,η²= 0.14), with increased risk ratings for CS + and decreased risk ratings for CS– as more trials were administered, indicating better learning with more trials administered.

The decreased threat-safety discrimination driven by increased risk ratings for CS– in the CA group was further validated when including adversity as a continuous variable. Specifically, results revealed a main effect of adversity (F(1,24)= 6.70,p=.017,η²= 0.01) and of stimulus (F(1,383)= 238.34,p<.001,η²= 0.37), and a significant stimulus by adversity interaction effect (F(1,383)= 4.46,p=.035,η²= 0.01). Thus, although the risk ratings for CS + were generally higher than for CS–, higher levels of adverse experiences were associated with more enhanced risk ratings for CS– relative to CS+ (Fig.2B). In other words, higher levels of adversity were associated with lower discrimination between CS + and CS–, which was mainly driven by more enhanced responses to CS–, supporting the findings when including adversity as a categorical variable. This association between higher levels of CA and the relatively more enhanced risk ratings for CS– as compared to CS + remained (F(1,383)= 4.51,p=.034,η²= 0.01) after controlling for depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms, indicating an adversity-related modulating effect that goes beyond current psychiatric symptoms of the three domains. No significant effects of psychiatric symptoms were observed (allp>.11).

No adversity-related overgeneralization was detected, with similar LDS in the two groups (MCA= −0.002,MHC= 0.11,t(53)= 0.64,p=.522, d = 0.17). Linear mixed models revealed a main effect of stimulus (F(5,2548)= 225.58,p<.001,η²= 0.29), showing an expected generalization gradient, with higher risk ratings for GSs that are more similar to CS + and lower risk ratings for GSs that are more similar to CS–, and similar responses between the conditioned stimuli and the generalization stimuli at the extreme (MGS1= 5.87,MCS+= 5.48,MGS2= 4.75,MGS3= 3.21,MCS–= 2.54,MGS4= 2.39; for all pairwise comparisonsp<.001, except for GS1 vs. CS+,p=.076, and for CS– vs. GS4,p=.917; Fig.3A). Interestingly, the CA group reported generally higher risk ratings across stimuli relative to the HC group (F(1,53)= 6.52,p=.014,η²= 0.01; Fig.3). However, no group by stimulus interaction effect was observed (p=.617), indicating that the generalization extent did not differ between groups, validating the finding of no difference in LDS. In addition, a main effect of trial was detected (F(1,2548)= 133.93,p<.001,η²= 0.04), with decreased risk ratings as more trials were administered, indicating a habituation effect.

The generally enhanced risk ratings across all stimuli were associated with higher levels of adversity exposure (F(1,24)= 7.11,p=.014,η²= 0.01) when including adversity as a continuous variable within the CA group. However, this effect disappeared (p=.13) while controlling for depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms, indicating the non-independent or shared effects of CA and current psychiatric symptoms. No significant effect of psychiatric symptoms were observed (allp>.13).

There was no significant effect of stimulus, group, and stimulus × group during preacquisition and acquisition phase (see supplement). During generalization phase, there was a significant stimulus by group interaction effect (F(5,2548)= 2.88,p=.013,η²= 0.01), with faster responses to GS1 than to GS2 in the HC group (p=.040; for all the other pairwise comparisonsp>.18; see supplement).

The current study investigated fear learning and fear generalization in adversity exposed youths who also presented with (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms. During fear acquisition, reduced threat-safety discrimination (quantified as CS + minus CS–) was observed in exposed individuals relative to healthy controls. Contrary to our hypothesis, this was mainly driven by increased risk ratings for CS– rather than blunted responses to CS+. Dimensional analysis further confirmed the findings, showing an association between higher levels of childhood adversity and relatively more enhanced risk ratings for CS– compared to CS+, thus decreased discrimination between CS– and CS+. This response pattern persisted while controlling for current depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms. During fear generalization, the expected generalization gradient was observed and, as hypothesized, the extent did not differ between the adversity and control group. Interestingly, the adversity group reported generally increased risk ratings across the stimuli as compared to the control group. The generally increased risk ratings were associated with higher levels of adversity, which disappeared, however, after controlling for current psychiatric symptoms.

The reduced threat-safety discrimination observed during fear acquisition in our adversity sample aligns with findings in mentally healthy adversity victims, where decreased discrimination measured via skin conductance responses (SCRs) has been reported compared to unexposed healthy adults [8]. However, contrary to our hypothesis (which predicted blunted responses to the CS + in the adversity group based on the prior study [8]), the reduced threat-safety discrimination was driven by the enhanced risk ratings for the CS– in the current study. The divergence may reflect differences in study populations. Unlike previous work examining asymptomatic adversity-exposed individuals [8], our sample comprised participants with (sub-)clinical symptoms across multiple domains (depression, anxiety, and psychosis). Notably, their response pattern—heightened reactivity to the CS– —mirrors findings in diagnosed psychiatric populations (e.g., GAD, PTSD, and OCD) [5]. This suggests that adversity-exposed individuals with emerging symptoms may represent a high-risk subgroup exhibiting fear learning abnormalities akin to those seen in established disorders. These findings highlight altered fear learning as a potential mechanism linking childhood adversity to psychopathology and underscore the need for early interventions.

More fine-grained analyses confirmed the finding, revealing that greater childhood adversity was associated with relatively more enhanced responses to CS– as compared to CS+. This effect persisted after accounting for current (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms, underscoring the unique role of adversity in the altered learning pattern. This finding aligns with our prior work of facial expression processing [34], where higher levels of childhood adversity, but not (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms, were associated with reduced angry-neutral face discrimination, suggesting a broader tendency to misclassify neutral/safety cues as threatening. Such consistent biases in neutral/safety information processing across paradigms/processes in exposed individuals with (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms, thus, might be a core underlying mechanism that predisposes them to develop psychopathology. For instance, a lower accuracy at identifying neutral expression has been shown to predict the transition to a psychotic disorder in individuals at ultra-high risk [35]. Longitudinal studies are needed to prospectively validate the relevance of the reported alterations in fear learning characterized by a lack of safety learning (and/or other related processing mechanisms) for the future development of psychopathology.

The extent of the generalization gradient, as hypothesized based on the previous study in exposed as compared to unexposed healthy adults [8], did not differ between the adversity and the control groups, with similar LDS in risk ratings, suggesting no adversity-related overgeneralization. However, different from the previous study that showed generally blunted fear responses (i.e. decreased SCRs) in the exposed relative to unexposed healthy individuals across preacquisition, acquisition and generalization phases [8], we observed generally enhanced risk ratings in exposed individuals relative to controls across the stimuli. Interestingly, our findings align with those found in PTSD patients [16] and exposed adult victims with various psychopathology including (subthreshold) PTSD and major depression disorder, persistent depressive disorder, PD, OCD, SAD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, insomnia and eating disorder [36]. PTSD patients reported generally increased risk ratings during fear generalization compared with healthy controls, while exposed controls (exposed to adversity but without developing psychopathology) did not differ from healthy controls [16]. Exposed adults with psychopathology reported higher risk ratings compared with both healthy controls and exposed controls [36]. Together, these findings suggest different patterns of fear generalization in exposed individuals with and without (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms of the generally enhanced risk overestimation are yet to be understood. Possibly, adversity victims with (sub-)clinical psychiatric symptoms show a sensitivity, thus less able to inhibit their fear, to the overall aversive context [5]. Another possibility, related to the previous explanation, is that, beyond the generalization based on perceptual similarity along one dimension (i.e. size of the circles in the current study), exposed individuals also show a higher-order generalization [37,38], i.e. they consider stimuli belonging to the same category (i.e. circles) are generally more risk-related or aversive, resulting in an upward shifted but similar extent of gradient in generalization responses as compared to unexposed healthy controls. Stronger generalization in ‘weak’ situations (e.g. generalization from atypical to typical exemplars belonging to the same category), for instance, has been observed in individuals at risk of developing pathological anxiety [38–40]. Further research with paradigms including stimuli that diverge from CS + on higher orders (e.g. different categories) or including different contexts [41] would be informative. Additionally, we found that the generally enhanced risk ratings were associated with individual differences in adversity. However, this effect was not independent of current psychiatric symptoms. Understanding the causality and/or the potential mediating effect of fear generalization requires further longitudinally designed studies.

Our findings were limited to risk ratings, with no significant group differences in reaction times. Furthermore, the physiological measure, i.e. FPS, was excluded from the analyses, as we could not yield enough valid data. Thus, our findings cannot be generalized to other outcome domain measures. Nonetheless, response patterns indexed by different outcome measures are rarely congruent [8,16,29,30,36]. For instance, while generally increased risk ratings across stimuli were reported in PTSD patients as compared to healthy controls during fear generalization, no such differences were detected in FPS between the two groups, while the reaction times effect depended on the stimulus type [16]. However, the unimodal nature of our approach constrains direct comparisons with previous studies and complicates interpretation of our findings, particularly regarding fear learning effects. While prior fear learning research has predominantly used SCR and FPS to show adversity-related blunted responses to the CS+ (see meta-analysis [7]), our study —relying on subjective risk ratings—instead revealed enhanced responses to CS–. This divergence may reflect distinct underlying mechanisms captured by different measurement modalities. Nevertheless, risk overestimation represents a core feature of anxiety-related psychopathology [42], thus measuring risk ratings may have a high predictive value and has also been widely used as an indicator of fear responses [13,14]. Future studies should adopt multimodal approaches that integrate subjective reports with objective behavioral, physiological (e.g., SCR, FPS), and neural measures to assess their unique predictive utility, clinical significance, and interrelationships.

Another limitation concerns our measures of childhood adversity, relying on retrospective self-report, which necessarily entails a possibility of recall bias [43,44]. Furthermore, due to the relatively small sample, we were not able to disentangle the effect of early threat (e.g. abuse and domestic violence) and neglect (e.g. physical and emotional neglect) experiences. The dimensional framework of childhood adversity [11,45] postulates that threat experiences specifically influence fear learning and the underlying neural circuitry. However, in contrast to the prediction, Klingelhöfer-Jens and colleagues [8] found that neglect, but not threat experiences (i.e. abuse), were associated with the CS discrimination in SCRs during acquisition. Also, our small sample limits the interpretability of our findings. Further studies with larger samples and including different types of childhood adversity falling into the two dimensions (i.e. threat and neglect) are urgently needed. Nonetheless, by measuring different categories of childhood adversity (peer and sibling victimization/bullying, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect and domestic violence), the current study was able to demonstrate the cumulative effect of multiple adverse experiences on altered fear learning and generalization, in terms of both the categorical and dimensional effects.

Additionally, the current study only included the adversity group with psychiatric symptoms and a healthy control group with no history of childhood adversity. While dimensional analyses supported an effect of adversity on fear learning independent of symptoms, future studies should incorporate two additional comparison groups: (1) adversity-exposed individuals without psychiatric symptoms and (2) individuals with psychiatric symptoms but no history of adversity. This would help clarify the unique contributions of adversity versus psychopathology. Further, our cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences regarding the relationships between childhood adversity, altered fear learning/generalization, and psychopathology development. Nevertheless, by examining this high-risk group—adversity-exposed youths at the transitional stage of emerging psychopathology—we identified fear response patterns resembling those seen in anxiety-related disorders.

The current study reveals altered fear learning and generalization in adversity-exposed youths with concurrent psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety and psychosis). Specifically, these individuals exhibited reduced threat-safety discrimination during fear learning, primarily driven by enhanced responses to the safe cue. This pattern was associated with their higher levels of childhood adversity and remained independent of psychiatric symptoms. During fear generalization, while the adversity group showed a similar generalization gradient to controls, they displayed generally enhanced responses across all stimuli. However, we could not fully disentangle the effects of adversity versus symptoms on this pattern. Notably, these altered fear responses differ from those observed in mentally healthy adversity-exposed individuals in prior studies but resemble patterns seen in individuals with diagnosable disorders. This suggests a potential vulnerability for future psychopathology in this group. Future studies with larger samples and diverse methodologies are needed to confirm these findings.
