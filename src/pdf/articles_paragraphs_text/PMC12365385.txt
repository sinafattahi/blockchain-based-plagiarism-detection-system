Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from natural killer (NK) cells possess inherent anti‐tumour activity and offer the advantages of cell‐free therapy. In this study, we genetically engineered NK‐sEVs to express interleukin 15 (IL15), an anti‐tumour cytokine, and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab on their surface, creating a potent anti‐tumour immunotherapy with enhanced tumour‐targeting capabilities. These IL15‐ and cetuximab‐tethered NK‐sEVs (eEVs) were generated using lentivirus‐based modification. eEVs selectively bound to EGFR+cancer cells in vitro, confirming cetuximab‐mediated targeting. Compared to control NK‐sEVs, eEVs exhibited significantly enhanced cytotoxicity by directly inducing cancer cell death and promoting NK cell‐mediated killing. In a lung cancer mouse model, eEVs selectively accumulated in tumours and exhibited significant anti‐tumour efficacy. Notably, their administration, alone or in combination with anti‐PD‐1 antibody therapy, effectively suppressed tumour growth. Overall, our results indicate that genetically engineered NK‐sEVs, equipped with IL15 and cetuximab, exhibit potent anti‐tumour activity and tumour‐targeting capabilities. These findings suggest that eEVs hold significant potential as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

We genetically engineered NK‐92 cells to produce NK‐sEVs expressing IL15 and cetuximab. These eEVs directly killed lung cancer cells and promoted immune cell‐mediated cytotoxicity. Compared to cEVs, eEVs showed enhanced cancer‐targeting abilities and significant anti‐tumour effects.

Lung cancer exhibits a globally elevated incidence and the highest mortality rate among all cancers (Siegel et al.2023). The most common histological subtype of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), representing approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, which comprises adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (Testa et al.2018). Early‐stage NSCLC is typically treated through surgical resection, whereas advanced‐stage cases are extensively treated using chemotherapy (Cheng et al.2021). Molecular targeted therapy is commonly recommended for patients with NSCLC who have specific genetic mutations, and the most successful cases involve the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors as targeted therapy for NSCLC with EGFR mutations (Liu, Chen, et al.2022; Ji et al.2006). However, in NSCLC, where targetable mutations are limited, the development of novel therapies for patients without specific mutations is crucial.

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are nanosized lipid bilayer vesicles, typically less than 200 nm in diameter, that are secreted by various cell types and play important roles in intercellular communication (Théry et al.2002; El Andaloussi et al.2013). This is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing both pathology and physiology. Moreover, sEVs have several advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, high stability and a unique cellular uptake mechanism, thus making them highly promising for anti‐tumour therapy (Herrmann et al.2021; Xu et al.2018). However, despite these strengths, currently developed sEV‐based therapeutics face challenges of insufficient efficacy and low delivery efficiency (Li et al.2019). Therefore, to overcome these limitations and exploit the advantages of sEVs, the development of modifications is essential to enhance their therapeutic efficacy and targeting capabilities (Luan et al.2017; Xu et al.2020).

Natural killer (NK) cells, integral components of the innate immune system, serve as frontline defenders against pathogens, tumour progression, and metastasis (Cerwenka and Lanier2001; Vivier et al.2008). sEVs derived from NK cells (NK‐sEVs) encapsulate microRNA, perforin, granzyme B, Fas ligand, and other tumour‐killing substances during biogenesis, thereby exhibiting their cytotoxic effects against various tumour cells (Zhu et al.2017; Kang et al.2021; Kaban et al.2021; Neviani et al.2019). NK‐sEVs maintain their anti‐tumour activity through a lack of signalling and metabolic pathways that are responsive to the inhibitory tumour microenvironment (TME) (Melaiu et al.2020). Therefore, NK‐sEVs may be considered as an alternative cancer treatment strategy that is capable of overcoming the suppressive TME.

In this study, membrane‐bound cytokine technology was used to genetically modify human NK cells, to exploit the potential of NK‐sEVs. Engineered NK‐sEVs (eEVs) were designed to surface‐express interleukin 15 (IL15) and the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab. Each of the tethered molecules exhibited the capacity to augment tumour cytotoxicity and enhance cancer targeting. This study revealed that eEVs demonstrate anti‐tumour effects in lung cancer cells, exerting anti‐tumour efficacy through the induction of NK cell‐mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, in a lung cancer mouse model, eEVs significantly inhibited tumour growth and, when used in combination with the anti‐PD‐1 antibody (αPD‐1 Ab), enhanced anti‐tumour efficacy. In conclusion, these results suggest that strategic modifications to NK‐sEVs may further enhance their anti‐tumour efficacy and target specificity, indicating their potential applications for novel cancer immunotherapy.

All cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. Human NK‐92 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) Alpha medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 12.5% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, USA), 12.5% horse serum (Invitrogen, USA), 0.2 mM inositol (Sigma‐Aldrich, USA), 0.1 mM 2‐mercaptoethanol (Sigma‐Aldrich), 0.02 mM folic acid (Sigma‐Aldrich), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS; Hyclone). Additionally, the culture medium for NK‐92 cells was consistently supplemented with 100 IU/mL of interleukin 2 (IL2; R&D Systems, USA), unless specified otherwise. A549‐Luc2 (human lung cancer cell lines) cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium (RPMI)‐1640 (Hyclone) medium with 10% FBS and 1% PS. LL/2‐Luc2 (mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cell lines) and HEK293FT cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Hyclone) with 10% FBS and 1% PS.

The pLV2 plasmid encoding IL15, sourced from a human cytokine library used in a prior study (Zha et al.2017), and the cetuximab single‐chain variable fragment sequence (scFv), obtained from DrugBank (Accession Number: DB00002), were cloned onto the same library‐based pLV2 plasmid (Zha et al.2017). The IL15 vector was designed to express the following components sequentially: the IL2 signalling sequence, the IL15 sequence, the Flag tag, the linker, the transmembrane domain of the platelet‐derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and mCherry. Similarly, the cetuximab vector was constructed to include the IL2 signalling sequence, cetuximab scFv, Flag tag, linker, and the PDGFR transmembrane domain. The linker, composed of repeating glycine and serine residues, connects the upstream sequence to the PDGFR transmembrane domain. This flexible design facilitates efficient protein expression, self‐stimulation and interaction with other cells. All relevant sequence information has been provided in TablesS1andS2. To generate a lentivirus that expressed either IL15 or cetuximab, HEK293FT cells were transfected with lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) and a lentiviral plasmid mixture comprising equal amounts of pCMVD8.9, pVSVg, and pLV2 plasmids, as per the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation, the DNA‐lipofectamine complex was removed and fresh medium was added to the culture dishes. The lentivirus‐containing supernatants were harvested after 48 h and filtered through a 0.45‐µm pore filter (Millipore, USA). The lentiviral titres were assessed utilizing the Lenti‐X p24 ELISA Kit (TaKaRa, Japan).

To generate NK‐sEVs that express IL15 and cetuximab on their cell surface, NK cells were transduced with the lentivirus produced as described above. NK‐92 cells were seeded in 12‐well plates at a concentration of approximately 5.0 × 105cells/well. Lentiviruses encoding IL15 and cetuximab were applied at a multiplicity of infection of 50 and supplemented with 10 µg/mL polybrene (Sigma‐Aldrich). The virus‐treated cell mixture was subjected to spinoculation at 1200 ×gfor 90 min at room temperature (RT), followed by overnight culture. The excess virus was removed, and the cells were replenished with fresh growth media.

To isolate sEVs from the NK‐92 cells, the media was replaced with serum‐free MEM Alpha medium. After incubation for 24 h, the cell culture supernatants were collected and serially centrifuged at 300 ×gfor 5 min, 2500 ×gfor 15 min, and 10,000 ×gfor 30 min. The supernatants were then filtered through a 0.2‐µm syringe filter and centrifuged at 120,000 ×gfor 90 min at 4°C. The purified NK‐sEV pellets were resuspended in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS, Hyclone).

The purified sEV pellets were fixed with 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 2.65% formaldehyde in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer solution (pH 7.2). The prepared fixative was cooled to below 4°C. The cooled fixative was added to the EV emulsion to achieve a 1:1 ratio. The mixed sEV emulsion was stored at below 4°C for 1 h, with pipetting performed every 10 min to ensure uniformity. Before loading the fixed sEV solution, Ni TEM grids (200 mesh, TED Pella) were plasma cleaned under flowing O2and Ar for 1 min using an advanced plasma cleaner (Gatan, 950 M). 10 µL of the fixed sEV solution was loaded onto plasma‐cleaned grids for 10 min. Using filter paper, the remaining solution was removed, and then 10 µL of sodium cacodylate buffer was loaded for washing. The process of removing with filter paper and loading SC was repeated at 10 min intervals more than 15 times to sufficiently eliminate the fixative. To remove any remaining salts from the sodium cacodylate buffer, the process of removing with filter paper and loading deionized water was repeated at 10 min intervals more than 15 times. The Ni TEM grid loaded with fixed sEVs was slowly dried at atmospheric pressure. All loading and washing processes were conducted at temperatures below 4°C. The prepared sEVs were observed using TEM (FEI, Tecnai G2 F20 TWIN TMP) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

The size and concentration of sEVs in cell culture supernatants were measured using the NanoSight LM10 instrument. A monochromatic laser beam at 405 nm was used to analyse the nanoparticles, and a video of 1 min duration was captured at a rate of 30 frames/s with a camera level of 4. Particles within the commonly reported sEV size range (i.e., below 200 nm) were analysed in each field of view. However, it is acknowledged that the lower limit of reliable detection for NTA is approximately 70–80 nm due to the optical limitations of the technique. The Brownian motion of the particles was tracked and analysed using NTA software (version 2.3, NanoSight).

After isolation by ultracentrifugation, NK‐sEVs were resuspended in sterile PBS. For fluorescent labelling, the sEVs were incubated with either 1,1'‐Dioctadecyl‐3,3,3',3'‐Tetramethylindotricarbocyanine Iodide (DiR,D12731; Invitrogen) or 1,1'‐Dioctadecyl‐3,3,3',3'‐Tetramethylindocarbocyanine Perchlorate (DiI, D3911; Invitrogen), both at a final concentration of 10 µM, at RT for 30 min in the dark. Following incubation, free dye was removed using tangential flow filtration (TFF) with hollow fibre polysulfone membranes (0.5 mm fibre ID; D02‐S05U‐05‐N; Repligen, USA), accompanied by a 10‐fold volume exchange with PBS to ensure thorough washing. A PBS‐only control was processed in parallel using the same DiI labelling and TFF washing steps and served as a free dye control for in vitro targeting experiments.

One microgram of RNA isolated from NK‐92 cells using the Direct‐zol RNA Microprep kit (R2060; Zymo Research, USA) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Omniscript Reverse Transcription kit (QIAGEN, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocols. To assess the expression levels of perforin, Fas ligand, granzyme B, and interferon‐γ in NK cells, qRT‐PCR was conducted using the StepOne Plus instrument (Thermo Fisher, USA) and SYBR premix (4368577; Thermo Fisher). The sequences of these primers are listed in TableS3. The relative mRNA levels were determined using the comparative threshold cycle (2−ΔΔCt) analysis method, with normalization to GAPDH mRNA levels.

To confirm IL15 and cetuximab expression on NK cell surfaces, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were further stained with their respective primary antibodies (anti‐IL15; MAB2471; R&D systems, and anti‐cetuximab; MAB9626; R&D systems) and then with the corresponding secondary antibodies (anti‐mouse IgG‐Alexa Fluor 488; A‐110051; Invitrogen, and anti‐rabbit IgG‐Alexa Fluor 488; A‐11008; Invitrogen). To evaluate the changes in cytotoxicity of NK‐92 cells induced by NK‐sEVs, we assessed the expression of granzyme B. The NK‐92 cells were fixed and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X‐100 in PBS. Cells were blocked and stained with the anti‐granzyme B (12‐8899‐41; Invitrogen). All experiments were conducted using the same number of cells within each experimental set to ensure consistency in protein expression analysis by flow cytometry. Samples were analysed using the CytoFLEX system (Beckman Coulter, USA) and FlowJo software v10 (BD, USA).

sEV proteins were analysed using nanoflow cytometry as previously described (Choi et al.2019). The purified NK‐sEVs were obtained as described in Section2.4. Briefly, sEVs were incubated with primary antibodies (anti‐IL15 [MAB2471; R&D Systems], anti‐cetuximab [MAB9626; R&D Systems], anti‐CD63 [ab68418; Abcam], and anti‐CD9 [ab2215; Abcam]) for 2 h at RT, followed by incubation with fluorophore‐conjugated secondary antibodies (anti‐mouse IgG‐Alexa Fluor 488 [A‐110051; Invitrogen] and anti‐rabbit IgG‐Alexa Fluor 488 [A‐11008; Invitrogen]) for 1 h at RT in the dark. Unbound antibodies were removed by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 ×gfor 90 min. Nanoflow cytometry was performed on a CytoFLEX system (Beckman Coulter) using the 405‐nm violet laser for side scatter (V‐SSC). The V‐SSC threshold was manually set to 2000 in the height channel. The flow rate was maintained at 10 µL/min, and the event rate was kept below 1000 events/sec to minimize swarm detection. Calibration was performed using 100‐, 150‐, 200‐, and 300‐nm polystyrene beads (Thermo Scientific 3000 Series Nanosphere Size Standards; 3100A, 3150A, 3200A, 3300A). sEVs were gated based on the scatter profile corresponding to the 100–200 nm bead range. Although polystyrene beads have a higher refractive index than biological vesicles, they were used here as a conventional reference for relative sizing, acknowledging that this may underestimate the true size of sEVs. The gating strategy is illustrated in FigureS3. Data were acquired and analysed using the CytoFLEX system and FlowJo software. All experiments were conducted using an equal number of sEV particles within each experimental set to ensure consistency in protein expression analysis. Appropriate negative controls (unstained sEVs and IgG isotype controls) were included to validate gating accuracy and account for nonspecific antibody binding.

A549 or SW620 cells (1 × 10⁴ cells/well) were incubated with DiI‐labelled sEVs (5 × 10⁷ particles) for 1.5 h in the dark to prevent photobleaching. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. The fixed cells were then washed, stained with DAPI, and mounted using a fluorescence‐compatible mounting solution. Fluorescence images were acquired using a ZEISS fluorescence microscope.

To investigate the direct cytotoxic effects of NK‐sEVs on lung cancer cells, A549‐Luc2 cells were seeded into 96‐well plates at a density of 1 × 104cells per well and incubated overnight. After incubation, the cells were treated with NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs) under equal particle conditions (2 × 10⁸ or 5 × 10⁸ particles) for 24 h to evaluate cancer cell proliferation and viability. Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay System (G3582, Promega, USA), which is based on the MTS assay, with absorbance measured at 490 nm using a VersaMax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, USA). For the in vivo imaging system (IVIS) analysis, A549‐Luc2 cells were treated with NK‐sEVs, and D‐luciferin (P/N 122799, PerkinElmer, USA) was used as the substrate, and the luminescence was analysed using the IVIS software.

NK‐92 cells were pre‐stimulated for 24 h with NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs) using an equal number of particles for each type of NK‐sEV. The sEV‐pre‐treated NK cells (effector cells, E) were co‐cultured with cancer cells (target cells, T), as previously described (Shin et al.2022). A549 cells (1 × 104cells/well) were used at a ratio of T:E = 1:0, 1:2, and 1:4. After co‐culture, MTS reagent was added to each well and incubated for 2 h, followed by absorbance measurement at 490 nm. For the IVIS analysis, A549‐Luc2 cells were treated with sEV‐pre‐treated NK, and D‐luciferin was used as the substrate, and the luminescence was analysed using the IVIS software.

To analyse sEV proteins, 15 µg of NK‐sEV lysates were separated by SDS‐PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS‐T at RT for 1 h, probed with the respective primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐linked secondary antibody at RT for 1 h. Membranes were imaged on ChemiDoc Imagers (Bio‐Rad, USA) using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed by Image Lab software (Bio‐Rad). All antibodies that were used in the experiments are listed below: anti‐IL15 (MAB2471; R&D systems), anti‐cetuximab (MAB9626; R&D systems), anti‐Alix (ab117600; Abcam), anti‐Tsg101 (ab30871; Abcam), anti‐CD63 (ab68418; Abcam), anti‐CD9 (ab2215; Abcam), and anti‐Grnayzme B (ab4059; Abcam).

All animal experiments adhered to relevant guidelines and were approved by the Kyungpook National University (KNU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). For the development of a syngeneic lung cancer mouse model, LL/2‐Luc2 cells were subcutaneously injected into 6‐week‐old male wild‐type C57BL/6 mice (Koatech Inc., Korea). Intravenous injections of cEVs or eEVs (1 × 1010particles) was administered every 2 days. For the combination therapy approach, αPD‐L1 Ab or IgG Ab (InVivoMAb, 10 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally every 3 days. Tumour growth was monitored every 2 days using digital callipers, and volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula V = ½ (length × width2). After 2 weeks, mice were euthanized via CO2inhalation, and luminescence was assessed using the IVIS imaging system.

First, 5 µm thick sections of paraffin‐embedded cancer tissues were fixed in 4% PFA. After deparaffinization with xylene, the slides were rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol before washing with PBS. Tissue slides in antigen retrieval buffer (ab93678; Abcam) were boiled for 10 min followed by cooling down at RT for 2 h. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) and 5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, S‐1000) in PBS were used for blocking peroxidase and non‐specific binding, respectively. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% normal goat serum (100 µL/slide) overnight at 4°C. After washing, secondary antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h. The slides were incubated with 200 µL DAB (Vector Laboratories, SK‐4100) at RT, counterstained with haematoxylin for 3 min, and then analysed using a bright‐field microscope. Quantification of Ki‐67–positive areas was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).

All values are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), as indicated for each point or graph. Data were analysed by the indicated tests using GraphPad Prism 10.0 software (GraphPad, USA).pvalues of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and *, **, ***, and **** representp< 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively.

In this study, our first aim was to generate human NK cells that expressed cytokines and antibodies on their surface using lentiviruses, and then subsequently harvest the sEVs from these engineered NK cells. To achieve this, we established the optimal conditions for sEV isolation while preserving NK cell viability. To isolate NK‐sEVs, cells were cultured in serum‐free medium for 24 h, followed by collection of the conditioned medium and subsequent differential ultracentrifugation. Using NTA, the size distribution of NK‐sEVs was found to be predominantly below 200 nm, with a peak at approximately 115 nm (Figure1a). Furthermore, TEM images revealed that the prepared NK‐sEVs were spherical particles with an intact membrane structure (Figure1b). Notably, the isolated NK‐sEVs were free from significant contamination by non‐vesicular components, such as lipoproteins (FigureS1).

Next, we manipulated the NK cells through lentiviral infection to express IL15 or cetuximab. The lentiviruses employed a unique display format by using a flexible linker to connect IL15 or cetuximab to the NK cell plasma membrane. We generated NK cells that expressed only IL15 (iNK), only cetuximab (aNK), or both IL15 and cetuximab (eNK) on their surface through this lentiviral system. The presence of IL15 and cetuximab in the engineered NK cells was confirmed through conventional PCR, fluorescent imaging, and flow cytometric analysis (Figures1c,dand FigureS2). As expected, 72 h post‐lentiviral infection, IL15 bands were observed only in iNK and eNK cells, which were infected with IL15‐expressing lentivirus, while cetuximab bands were detected in aNK and eNK cells, which were transduced by cetuximab‐expressing lentivirus. (FigureS2). Fluorescence from mCherry that was linked to IL15 was exclusively observed in the iNKs and eNKs (Figure1c). The surface expression of IL15 and cetuximab on the NK cells was confirmed through flow cytometric analysis (Figure1d).

After successfully generating iNK, aNK, and eNK cells, we confirmed the expression of IL15 and cetuximab on the surface of their respective NK‐sEVs (iEVs, aEVs, and eEVs) through nanoflow cytometry and western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that IL15 and cetuximab were displayed on the surface of eEVs as intended (Figures1e,gand FigureS3). Additionally, the expression of sEV markers was similarly confirmed not only in control NK‐sEVs (cEVs) but also in each of the engineered NK‐sEVs (iEVs, aEVs, and eEVs) (Figures1f,g; FiguresS3andS4). Taken together, we successfully generated NK‐sEVs with IL15 alone, cetuximab alone, or both IL15 and cetuximab simultaneously tethered to their surface, and we confirmed their fundamental characteristics.

We investigated whether cetuximab expression on the NK‐sEV surface enhances selective delivery to EGFR‐expressing cancer cells. Given the specificity of cetuximab for EGFR, we hypothesized that the uptake of NK‐sEVs would be dependent on the EGFR expression level of target cells. To test this, A549 (EGFR‐positive) (Van Schaeybroeck et al.2006) and SW620 (EGFR‐negative) (Yang et al.2004) cancer cells were treated with PBS or DiI‐labelled NK‐sEVs for 4 h, followed by flow cytometry to quantify DiI‐positive cells. The PBS control underwent the same DiI staining and washing steps as the NK‐sEVs and was used as a free dye control. In A549 cells, cetuximab‐expressing NK‐sEVs (aEVs and eEVs) showed a significantly greater proportion of DiI‐positive cells compared to cEVs, whereas iEV uptake was similar to that of cEVs. However, in SW620 cells, no significant differences were observed across all NK‐sEV groups, regardless of surface modifications (Figure2a). Furthermore, ICC was performed, and confocal microscopy imaging confirmed that aEVs and eEVs exhibited greater binding to A549 cells than cEVs, whereas no differences were observed in SW620 cells (Figures2b,c). These results demonstrate that our eEVs, which display cetuximab scFv on their surface, bind to cancer cells more rapidly in an EGFR‐dependent manner and are delivered more efficiently than cEVs.

Cetuximab‐tethered NK‐sEVs specifically target EGFR‐expressing cancer cells. (a) Representative histogram (left) and quantification (right) of flow cytometry analysis of DiI‐positive cells in A549 (EGFR‐positive) and SW620 (EGFR‐negative) cancer cell lines 4 h after treatment with PBS or DiI‐labelled NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs) at a concentration of 5 × 10⁸ particles (n= 3). PBS was subjected to the same DiI labelling and washing procedures as the NK‐sEVs to control for free dye artefacts. (b), (c) Representative immunocytochemistry (ICC) images of A549 (b) and SW620 (c) cells following 1.5 h of treatment with PBS or DiI‐labelled NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs) at a concentration of 5 × 107particles. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ****p< 0.0001. ns, not significant.

We examined whether NK‐sEVs could reduce the viability of A549 human lung cancer cells. MTS analysis revealed that all NK‐sEVs inhibited A549 cell viability at all tested doses. Treatment with iEVs or eEVs, which express IL15 on their surface, significantly induced cancer cell death compared to treatment with cEVs. Notably, when 5 × 10⁸ particles of NK‐sEVs were administered, eEVs showed a markedly stronger inhibitory effect on A549 cell viability compared to other NK‐sEVs (Figure3a). A similar trend was observed in A549 cells that expressed luciferase (A549‐Luc2) when treated with each of the NK‐sEVs: cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs (Figure3b). These results indicate that NK‐sEVs expressing IL15 on their surface exhibit stronger anti‐tumour effects than cEVs. Although aEVs were less effective than iEVs or eEVs, they still induced significant cancer cell death compared to cEVs (Figures3a,b). Since cetuximab is known to have a minimal impact on the survival of A549 cells (Mukohara et al.2005), the enhanced cancer cell‐killing ability of aEVs compared to cEVs suggests that cetuximab effectively targets cancer cells, allowing NK‐sEVs to exert their effects more efficiently.

Anti‐tumour effects of NK‐sEVs on lung cancer cells due to changes in NK‐sEV‐derived cytotoxic molecules. (a), (b) We assessed the viability of A549‐Luc2 cells treated with NK‐sEVs: cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs. After treatment with NK‐sEVs at concentrations of 2 × 108particles and 5 × 108particles, cell viability was evaluated 24 h later using MTS analysis (n= 4) (a) and luminescence analysis (n= 5) (b). (c) Quantification of relative mRNA expression levels of perforin, Fas ligand, granzyme B, and interferon‐γ in control NK cells (cNKs) and various engineered NK cells (iNKs, aNKs, eNKs) as assessed by qRT‐PCR (n= 3). (d) Granzyme B protein expression within NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, eEVs) was analysed by western blotting. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. *p< 0.05; **p< 0.01; ***p< 0.001; ****p< 0.0001.

Next, we investigated how the engineered NK‐sEVs induced the death of lung cancer cells. Various mechanisms, such as the receptor–ligand‐mediated pathway and perforin‐and‐granzyme B‐mediated pathway, have been revealed to affect the cytotoxicity and targeting ability of NK cells in tumours (Russell and Ley2002). We measured the mRNA expression levels of cytotoxic molecules, including perforin, Fas ligand, interferon‐γ, and granzyme B, within each engineered NK cell using qRT‐PCR. We observed that all these factors were upregulated by at least 2.5‐fold in iNK and eNK cells, which express IL15 on their surface, compared to cNK cells. However, the expression of these genes in aNK cells, which express only cetuximab, showed no difference compared to that in cNK cells (Figure3c). These findings indicate that IL15‐expressed NK cells exhibit increased levels of cytotoxic molecules, which is consistent with previous studies showing that IL15 induces the activation of cytotoxic molecules in NK cells (Leong et al.2014; Zhu et al.2019; Widowati et al.2020). Additionally, when assessing the granzyme B protein levels within the cargo of sEVs derived from each engineered NK cell, we found that iEVs and eEVs expressing IL15 showed an increase of more than 1.5‐fold compared to cEVs or aEVs (Figure3d). These results collectively suggest that IL15 expression on the surface of NK cells leads to an increase in cytotoxic molecules within the cells, resulting in a greater payload of these molecules within the sEVs. Consequently, the enhanced anti‐tumour efficacy of eEVs expressing both IL15 and cetuximab, compared to sEVs expressing either IL15 or cetuximab alone, is likely due to the additive effect of the IL15‐induced increase in cytotoxic molecules and the enhanced targeting capability provided by cetuximab.

We assessed whether eEVs could enhance immune cell‐mediated anti‐tumour effects in vitro. A co‐culture analysis was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of NK‐92 cells that were prestimulated by NK‐sEVs against lung cancer cells (Figure4a). MTS analysis showed that NK cells pre‐stimulated with IL15‐expressing NK‐sEVs (iEVs or eEVs) significantly increased lung cancer cell death compared to those pre‐stimulated with cEVs. In contrast, NK cells pre‐stimulated with cetuximab‐expressing aEVs did not exhibit a significant difference in cancer cell death compared to cEV‐treated cells (Figure4b). Furthermore, similar findings were observed when assessing the luciferase activity of the surviving A549‐Luc2 cells after co‐culture with NK‐92 cells (Figure4c).

(d) Representative flow cytometric histograms (left) and bar graphs (right) showing the activity of NK‐92 cells after treatment with PBS control, NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs), or rIL2 (1000 IU) (n= 3). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. **p< 0.01; ***p< 0.001; ****p< 0.0001; and ns, not significant.

Subsequently, we investigated whether the NK‐sEVs influenced the activity of immune cells in vitro. After treating NK92 cells with each of the NK‐sEVs (cEVs, iEVs, aEVs, or eEVs), we measured the levels of granzyme B, a key indicator of NK cell cytotoxicity. When treated with cEVs or aEVs, the granzyme B expression was similar to that observed with PBS treatment. However, when treated with iEVs or eEVs, which express IL15 on their surface, NK cell activation significantly enhanced compared to treatment with PBS, cEVs, or aEVs (Figure4d). These results suggest that IL15 expressed on the surface of NK‐sEVs leads to the activation of NK cells, thereby inducing cancer cell death through immune cell‐mediated cytotoxicity.

Having established that cetuximab‐EGFR interactions enhance eEV delivery to cancer cells in an in vitro system, we next examined whether this targeting capability remains effective in the more complex in vivo environment. To track NK‐sEVs in vivo, cEVs and eEVs were labelled with DiR and then intravenously injected into nude mice with A549‐Luc2 cell xenografts. After 24 h, the in vivo distribution was measured to assess the tumour‐targeting efficiency of NK‐sEVs. Unlike the cEV‐treated mice, those treated with eEVs exhibited fluorescence signals within the tumour (Figure5a). Fluorescence analysis was performed after collecting the tumour tissues, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys of the mice. As shown in Figure5b, both the cEVs and eEVs primarily accumulated in the liver; however, the eEVs were uniquely detected in the tumour as well. Although a dedicated free dye–only control was not included in this in vivo analysis, both cEV and eEV samples were labelled and processed under identical conditions. Therefore, any potential background fluorescence due to free dye would likely be equally present in both groups. These data suggest that the enhanced fluorescence signal observed in the tumour region is attributable to the engineered targeting ability of eEVs rather than nonspecific dye distribution. This tumour‐targeting effect is attributed to the EGFR–cetuximab interaction.

(a) After intravenous administration of 1 × 1010particles/mouse of DiR‐labelled cEVs or eEVs, in vivo fluorescence imaging in mice was performed to determine the biodistribution of sEVs (n= 2). (b) Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of the sEVs in the individual organs. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS).

Based on the in vitro results, we investigated the in vivo anti‐tumour efficacy of the eEVs using a syngeneic lung cancer mouse model. After subcutaneously injecting LL/2‐Luc2 cells into wild‐type C57BL/6 mice, PBS, cEVs, or eEVs were intravenously administered every 2 days, starting at 5 days post‐injection of the LL/2‐Luc2 cells (Figure6a). We sacrificed the mice 17 days after lung cancer inoculation and measured the tumour volume, bioluminescence signals, and weight. In the syngeneic lung cancer mouse model, the eEV‐treated group demonstrated a significant anti‐tumour effect, inhibiting tumour growth by over 42% compared with the control group (Figures6a,b). Similarly, treatment with eEVs significantly suppressed the tumour weight compared with the PBS‐ or cEV‐treated groups (Figure6c). Specifically, when compared with cEVs, the eEVs inhibited the tumour weight by approximately 30% in the lung cancer mouse model (Figure6c). We further observed a reduction of over 43.1% in the spleen weight of eEV‐treated mice compared with that of the cEV‐treated group (Figure6d). These results suggest that eEVs prevent splenomegaly and exhibit potent anti‐tumour efficacy. To analyse the effect of eEVs on cancer cells in vivo, the expression of Ki‐67 expression in tumour tissues was evaluated using IHC. Quantitative analysis revealed that Ki‐67 levels were significantly reduced in the eEV‐treated group compared to both PBS‐ and cEV‐treated mice (Figure6e).

We evaluated whether eEVs could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of αPD‐1 Ab in a combination treatment. Five days after the subcutaneous injection of LL/2‐Luc2 lung cancer cells into the wild‐type C57BL/6 mice, we administered PBS or eEVs intravenously every 2 days and IgG Ab or αPD‐1 Ab intraperitoneally every 3 days (Figure7a). The αPD‐1 Ab treatment inhibited tumour growth by 66% in the syngeneic lung cancer mouse model compared with the IgG control group. Interestingly, the eEV and αPD‐1 Ab combination treatment had a significant inhibitory effect on tumour growth, showing a reduction of approximately 73% compared with the control group (Figures7a,b). The eEVs, along with αPD‐1 Ab, suppressed the tumour weight by approximately 61.5% compared with the control IgG group, whereas αPD‐1 Ab treatment alone decreased tumour weight by only 20.7% (Figure7c). In particular, the combination treatment significantly reduced tumour weight by approximately 51.5% compared with the αPD‐1 Ab alone. Additionally, splenomegaly was reduced by more than 32.9% in the combination treatment group compared with the IgG Ab‐treated control group (Figure7d). These findings confirmed that the combination treatment of eEVs and αPD‐1 Ab improved the therapeutic potential compared with monotherapy.

In this study, we genetically engineered human NK‐92 cells using lentiviruses to produce NK‐sEVs that expressed IL15 and cetuximab on their surface. These eEVs demonstrated anti‐tumour effects through two mechanisms: the direct killing of lung cancer cells and an indirect effect that increased immune cell‐mediated cytotoxicity. Cetuximab, tethered to the surface of the eEVs, recognized EGFR in NSCLC, which enhanced their cancer‐targeting abilities. Treatment with eEVs exhibited significant anti‐tumour effects, and when used in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), αPD‐1 Ab, it further enhanced the anti‐tumour efficacy. These findings indicate the potential clinical applicability of NK‐sEVs as an alternative immunotherapeutic agent.

Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to suppress or eliminate tumour cells by enhancing the anti‐tumour immune response. Represented by ICIs such as the PD‐1/PD‐L1 blockade, immunotherapy stands out for cancer treatment because of its ability to provide sustained efficacy and allow for long‐term survival (Yin et al.2021; Mandal et al.2019). Ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating the effectiveness of various anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 antibodies as primary, secondary, or adjuvant therapies (Saleh et al.2018; Mayor et al.2016). Notably, PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors demonstrate promising anti‐tumour activity against NSCLC. However, it has become increasingly evident that immunotherapy is not universally effective for most patients, and only a minority, approximately 20% of patients with NSCLC, benefit from its effects (Seya et al.2018). Consequently, there is a recognized need for various combination therapies, leading to numerous endeavours in this direction. In our results, the combination treatment of eEVs and αPD‐1 Ab exhibited enhanced anti‐tumour effects in a lung cancer mouse model compared to the treatment with αPD‐1 Ab alone (Figure7). These results suggest that eEVs, with their ability to directly kill NSCLC cells and activate immune cells (Figures3a,band Figure4), exhibited a greater synergistic effect, which resulted in cancer growth inhibition. These findings suggest a potential alternative for patients with lung cancer who are resistant to ICI therapy, indicating a new direction for further research and clinical investigation.

Cytokines are small glycoproteins and polypeptides that are secreted for intercellular signalling within an organism, and act in an autocrine or paracrine manner. These bioactive molecules hold considerable importance in modulating the immune system by regulating the immune cells activity (Lin and Leonard2019). Notably, they exert a significant influence on the modulation of the TME by facilitating cancer antigen presentation, initiating T cell priming and activation, promoting the infiltration of effector T cells into the TME, and triggering the activation of NK cells (Chen and Mellman2013). Recent research has focused on various cytokines that enhance the immunotherapeutic effects of NK cells. IL12, IL15, and IL18 enhance the proliferation and cytotoxicity of NK cells in solid tumours (Leong et al.2014; Widowati et al.2020; Mirjačić Martinović et al.2015; Zhuang et al.2019). Moreover, several studies have indicated that cytokine stimulation increases the cytotoxic activity of NK‐sEVs. For instance, IL15 treatment enhanced NK‐sEV cytotoxicity against breast cancer and glioblastoma, and NK‐sEVs stimulated with IL15 and IL21 exhibited potent anti‐tumour effects against liver cancer (Zhu et al.2019; Kim et al.2023). In our results, the surface expression of IL15 on NK cells further enhanced the anti‐tumour capabilities of eEVs compared with cEVs through an autocrine manner (Figures3c,d). Beyond our results, Zhu et al. demonstrated that IL15 stimulation in NK cells was associated with increased sEV production rates (Zhu et al.2019). Addressing the challenge of the naturally low yield of secreted sEVs, which is an important obstacle for clinical application, our engineering approach involving IL15 surface expression on NK cells aims to amplify sEV production and enhance anti‐tumour capabilities. This strategy provides the possibility of progressing to clinical applications.

sEVs are considered effective nanocarriers of endogenous or artificially loaded biological contents (Parada et al.2021). Characteristics such as rapid internalization into recipient cells, low immunogenicity even upon repeated administration, and the potential to modify cargo molecules or surface membranes for specific targeting have made sEVs powerful therapeutic agents (Parada et al.2021). However, sEVs do not inherently possess specificity for the target cells. The intravenous administration of exogenous or therapeutic sEVs in mammals is mainly associated with their accumulation in the liver, spleen, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, with limited access to the target cells (Wiklander et al.2015). To overcome these limitations, previous studies have employed EV surface antibody engineering to facilitate cell‐specific delivery. Cetuximab was designed to bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR and has been used for the treatment of colorectal, cervical, and lung cancer, as well as other malignancies. Based on this, it was confirmed that cetuximab tethering to the surface of NK‐sEVs significantly enhanced their antibody‐mediated cancer cell targeting potential (Figure2and Figure5). The use of other antibodies targeting proteins that are specifically expressed on cancer cells (e.g., HER2) provides a potential route for future treatment of various cancers and is not limited to NSCLC. This suggests the expandable potential for the application of this anti‐tumour treatment and provides a new perspective for cancer therapy.

sEV‐based therapies have emerged as promising strategies for lung cancer treatment, attracting significant attention due to their capability as natural delivery vehicles for therapeutic molecules. Among the various sEV‐based approaches, NK cell‐derived sEVs, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)‐derived sEVs, and dendritic cell (DC)‐derived sEVs exhibit inherent anti‐tumour properties, reflecting the unique characteristics of the cells from which they are derived (Enomoto et al.2022; Markov et al.2019; Shan et al.2024; Weng et al.2021). To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sEVs, these vesicles can be loaded with agents such as miRNAs or chemical drugs (e.g., doxorubicin), thereby increasing their potential as treatment modalities (Li et al.2022). However, the inherent lack of targeting specificity in sEVs leads to nonspecific distribution to non‐target cells, significantly limiting their effective accumulation at tumour sites. Recently, the strategy of expressing antibodies on the surface of engineered sEVs has been reported as a means to overcome these challenges. This includes the development of platforms that facilitate sEV delivery through the expression of Fc regions on sEVs, allowing for the attachment of antibodies (C. Liu, X. Liu, et al.2022). Additionally, studies have progressed to expressing antibodies on sEVs derived from DCs, further enhancing their targeting capabilities (Wang et al.2023). Chien et al. demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo EGFR‐mediated tumour‐targeting efficacy of HEK 293 cell‐derived sEVs expressing cetuximab (Chien et al.2024). Similarly, engineered CD8+T cell‐derived sEVs expressing cetuximab mediated specific interactions with EGFR on A549 lung cancer cells in vitro (Cho et al.2023). Building on these findings, we propose an innovative approach that leverages the intrinsic anti‐tumour properties of immune cell‐derived sEVs. In this study, the developed eEVs demonstrated enhanced tumour‐targeting capabilities and anti‐tumour effects compared to control sEVs (cEVs) (Figures2,3,4,5,6). Furthermore, through genetic engineering, as demonstrated in previous studies, IL15, which induces NK cell activation, was attached to the cell surface, enabling IL15 to function in an autocrine manner (Shin et al.2022; Jung et al.2022). This allows for a higher payload of anti‐tumour substances within the cargo of NK‐sEVs (Figure3d). This engineering approach has resulted in NK‐sEVs with enhanced anti‐tumour efficacy. This sEV engineering approach offers a valuable strategy for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness of other sEV types, such as MSC‐sEVs and DC‐sEVs, which possess inherent anti‐tumour properties. This approach is anticipated to become a leading sEV‐based therapeutic platform for maximizing their anti‐tumour potential. While this study was specifically designed to evaluate engineered NK‐sEVs as a therapeutic platform, we acknowledge that the inclusion of non‐NK‐derived sEVs engineered with IL15 and cetuximab would provide greater clarity in distinguishing the effects of surface modifications from the intrinsic properties of NK‐sEVs.

Recent research has highlighted the significant anti‐tumour efficacy of NK‐sEVs, underscoring their potential as promising cancer therapeutics (Zhu et al.2019; Si et al.2024; Hatami et al.2023). However, several critical challenges must be addressed to successfully translate these therapies into clinical applications. In particular, understanding the long‐term effects of repeated NK‐sEV administrations is crucial, with a focus on maintaining sustained therapeutic efficacy while assessing potential side effects, such as immune reactions and the development of resistance. Although there are no studies specifically examining the long‐term administration of NK‐sEVs, it is important to consider that prolonged sEV treatments could potentially lead to increased scarring and remodelling in the ischaemic myocardium due to the proliferation of fibroblasts (Jung et al.2017). Therefore, determining optimal dosing strategies and administration frequencies is essential to maximize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing potential risks. In addition to safety concerns, the clinical application of NK‐sEVs faces substantial manufacturing and regulatory challenges. Achieving scalable and reproducible production with consistent quality is particularly difficult for immune cell–derived EVs, as donor variability, activation status, and culture conditions can affect both yield and function. Furthermore, ensuring long‐term storage stability and preserving the biological activity of engineered sEVs remains an active area of investigation. Several technical strategies, including the use of bioreactor‐based NK cell expansion and purification methods such as TFF and size exclusion chromatography, are being explored to support production at a clinical scale that meets regulatory standards. To enhance the therapeutic utility of sEVs, previous studies have employed cytokine stimulation, surface antibody engineering, and drug loading within sEVs (Herrmann et al.2021; Takahashi and Takakura2023; Kim et al.2024). In line with these approaches, our study introduces a dual‐functional platform in which NK‐sEVs are engineered to express both IL15 and cetuximab on their surface. This design enhances the intrinsic anti‐tumour activity of the vesicles and promotes immune cell stimulation and tumour‐specific targeting. While this strategy may reduce the need for systemic cytokine administration, the inclusion of IL15 may still lead to unintended immune activation. Although no overt toxicity was observed in our in vivo models, this does not eliminate the need for thorough safety evaluation. Comprehensive preclinical testing, such as cytokine release profiling, biodistribution analysis, immune cell activation studies, and dose‐escalation experiments, will be essential to support the clinical translation of this engineered NK‐sEV platform.

In this proof‐of‐concept study, we engineered NK‐sEVs with IL15 and cetuximab tethered to their surface. Even though the eEVs exhibited significant anti‐tumour effects compared with the cEVs, there is a lack of understanding regarding the anti‐tumour mechanism of eEVs. We observed an increase in the levels of the representative cytotoxic molecules within the manipulated NK cells (Figure3c). Additionally, we confirmed an upregulation of granzyme B expression, a representative cytotoxic substance, in the eEVs (Figure3d). However, this result alone does not sufficiently explain the enhanced anti‐tumour effects of eEVs. To elucidate the enhanced anti‐tumour mechanism of eEVs, it is necessary to identify the altered molecules, such as miRNA, RNA, and proteins, by profiling the internal contents of sEVs. According to a previous study that employed a similar strategy, the expression of IL2 on the surface of T cell‐derived sEVs (IL2‐sEVs) induced an autocrine‐based stimulation of T cells, which led to a dramatic alteration in the internal contents of the sEVs (C. Liu, X. Liu, et al.2022). Increased miR‐181a‐3p in internally reprogrammed IL2‐sEVs inhibited the activity of regulatory T cells and enhanced the activity of CD8+T cells. Additionally, miR‐181a‐3p and miR‐223‐3p significantly reduced PD‐L1 protein levels in melanoma cells. This study demonstrated an anti‐tumour mechanism in melanoma through increased miRNA content within the IL2‐sEVs. Given these findings, future studies should investigate the internal content changes in NK‐sEVs that contribute to the enhanced anti‐tumour effects of eEVs.

In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that sEVs derived from NK cells, through surface engineering, target cancer cells, thus proving to be a novel cancer immunotherapy with potent anti‐tumour efficacy. Furthermore, we expect that the use of eEVs, either alone or in combination with traditional immunotherapy, could result in substantial progress in cancer therapy.
