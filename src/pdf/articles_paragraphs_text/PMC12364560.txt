We accidentally used the formula for doubling time applicable to linear growth instead of the correct exponential growth formula. When corrected, this leads to the following amendments.

The exponential fit results in a doubling time ofθ=1log2(r)≈23.64hfor the area of theTrypanosomacolonies.

The area doubling time derived from our fitting exceeds the population doubling time reported in the literature [1,2] but is within the margin of error of the reported doubling times of the monolayer assay we used [3]. This indicates that cell growth is the primary driver of colony expansion, and the area increase could be used as a proxy for cell growth.

The exponential segment of the fitting function yielded doubling times of approximatelyθ=1log2(r)≈20.96hfor the repelled colonies andθ=1/r≈20.91hoursfor the controlTrypanosomacolonies.

All other results and the conclusions drawn are unaffected.
