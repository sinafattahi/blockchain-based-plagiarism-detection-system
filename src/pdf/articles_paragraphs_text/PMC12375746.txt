This paper presents a coordinated voltage and frequency control strategy for a wind-integrated deregulated dual-area power system comprising three Generation Companies (GENCOs), diesel, thermal, and wind—and three Distribution Companies (DISCOs) in each area. A Harris Hawks Optimization-based Model Predictive Controller (MPC-HHO) is proposed to enhance system performance under three distinct market scenarios: poolco, bilateral, and contract violation modes. The proposed controller is benchmarked against conventional PID, fractional-order PIλDF, and MPC schemes optimized via Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Simulation results show that the MPC-HHO controller achieves the lowest figure of demerit (FOD = 385.75), with up to 54.07% improvement over MPC-PSO and faster settling time under various test cases. Further, integration of Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) demonstrates significant improvement in frequency regulation, with marginal enhancements in voltage response. Robustness of the proposed approach is validated through eigenvalue analysis, sensitivity to DISCO Participation Matrix (DPM), contract violations, time-delay effects, and random load variations, confirming its applicability in complex and dynamic smart grid environments.

In modern power networks, maintaining a stable balance between energy supply and demand is critical to avoid operational disturbances that can affect both generation systems and connected loads. A mismatch in generation and consumption may lead to severe instabilities such as frequency deviations or voltage fluctuations, which can compromise grid reliability. To address these challenges, power systems are equipped with control mechanisms like Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR) and Load Frequency Control (LFC) loops. These control structures work together to regulate voltage levels and maintain nominal system frequency during dynamic conditions1.

However, with the rapid expansion of population, increasing energy demands, and growing penetration of renewable energy sources, achieving precise control has become more complex. Renewable energy, while environmentally beneficial, introduces variability and intermittency, making frequency and voltage management more demanding. Furthermore, the global shift towards market-based electricity systems has transformed the structure of traditional power networks2. In deregulated power markets, multiple independent generation and distribution companies operate competitively, guided by centralized entities known as Independent System Operators (ISOs). This evolving structure necessitates advanced and robust control solutions to ensure seamless power system operation under dynamic and uncertain conditions3. In a deregulated power market, the Independent System Operator (ISO) acts as a neutral coordinating authority responsible for ensuring system reliability, facilitating non-discriminatory access to the transmission network, and overseeing market transactions between GENCOs and DISCOs.

Automatic Generation Control (AGC) has been extensively studied in both traditional and deregulated power system frameworks. Early investigations focused primarily on conventional environments, employing a variety of secondary control strategies to manage frequency and power balance4–7. With growing interest in advanced tuning techniques, meta-heuristic optimization methods have been increasingly applied to enhance the performance of classical PID controllers, especially in the context of deregulated Load Frequency Control (LFC) scenarios8–12. In recent years, the integration of renewable energy sources has introduced additional challenges due to their intermittent nature, prompting researchers to explore frequency regulation under such dynamic conditions13.

To address these fluctuations, several studies have proposed the use of intelligent control mechanisms. For instance, Sharma et al.14implemented a fuzzy logic-based controller coupled with a redox flow battery to stabilize frequency in a deregulated setting. Furthermore, energy storage solutions such as Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) devices have been proposed for their fast-acting capabilities, although high costs remain a limiting factor15,16. Consequently, alternative strategies like Electric Vehicle (EV) participation through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) communication17, responsive demand-side management18, and controllable loads19have been introduced to provide distributed support during transient events.

The concept of virtual inertia has also been explored in the literature to mitigate the frequency instability caused by the variability of renewable generation20. Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices, including TCSC, TCPS, and IPFC, have been utilized to further enhance frequency damping and improve dynamic response in interconnected networks21–23. However, most of these studies have focused on vertically integrated systems. In one of the few works addressing deregulated structures, Rajbongshi et al.24examined a PIλDF-based controller applied to a wind-integrated combined AVR-LFC model. While effective, the approach exhibited prolonged settling times under certain conditions.

Overall, the literature highlights that classical PID-based and fractional-order controllers are most commonly used in combined voltage and frequency control tasks25–27. Only a limited number of studies have investigated the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to such problems28, and even fewer have extended this approach to deregulated environments. Thus, there remains a significant opportunity to explore and optimize MPC strategies tailored for complex, market-based power systems for better solutions to various power system problems29–33.

A novel endeavor has been made to concurrently curtail voltage and frequency deviations in the wind integrated deregulated power system using Harris Hawks Optimized Model Predictive Controller. The transient response from the MPC-HHO system has been evaluated and compared with existing PIλDF, HHO tuned PID, MPC-PSO, and MPC WOA controllers for three different cases, e.g., poolco, bilateral, and contract violation.

To address fluctuations arising from variable load demand and renewable energy integration, this work introduces the coordinated use of an Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) and Electric Vehicle (EV) systems interfaced with the grid. Simulation outcomes demonstrate a noticeable improvement, with a substantial decline in system frequency deviations observed under these conditions.

The stability analysis of the controlled AVR-LFC system has been accomplished using the eigenvalue method. Further, the validation of robustness has been obtained after performing various sensitivity tests in DPM (DISCO participation matrix), changes in contract violation, and time delays in area controller error. Also, a randomly varying loading pattern has been introduced to verify the suitability of the presented controller.

Section “Introduction” outlines the fundamental concepts and reviews prior research concerning frequency and voltage regulation issues in interconnected power systems operating under a deregulated framework. Section “System considered” provides a concise modeling description of the integrated AVR-LFC system, incorporating Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) and Electric Vehicle (EV) components. The third section elaborates on the design of an optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, optimized using the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm, for simultaneous voltage and frequency regulation. Section 4 details the key results and insights obtained from the proposed methodology, concluding with final observations and summary remarks.

As represented in Fig.1, a 2-area system having 3 GENCOs and 3 DISCOs in each area, wherein wind turbine integration along with conventional thermal and diesel plants has been considered. The detailed transfer function based AVR-LFC modelling of this system under deregulated cases considering nonlinearities GDB and GRC has been taken from reference24.

For optimal control in each area, a centralized Model Predictive Controller approach has been implemented considering the area control error (ACE) as the respective measured output (MO) and control input as the manipulated variable (MV) for MPC, and the MPC parameter values are fine-tuned using the HHO algorithm. Further, for additional support while eliminating sudden frequency dips, the authors have also implemented IPFC and EV integration with the grid for MPC-HHO regulated system.

IPFC is a series of voltage source converters (VSCs) connected to multiple transmission lines with coupling transformers as well as the DC terminals of converters are coupled through a link. In complex power networks, the transmission efficiency can be enhanced after adding the necessary amount of series voltage in transmission lines. IPFC is employed to control reactive power by providing series reactive power compensation in the system and also, it provides real power balance by maneuvering the power electronic converters in accordance with the respective transmission line. The transient performance enhancement is achieved using IPFC in coordination with the existing controller methodology24.

In recent years, integrating electric vehicles (EVs) with the power grid has attracted significant attention from researchers focusing on energy system control and stability. In this study, the EV module represents a cluster of electric vehicles linked to the grid through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communication. These EVs function as dynamic energy storage units, responding adaptively to consumer power demand. When the demand surges, the EV batteries discharge energy to the grid, whereas during low demand periods, surplus energy from the grid charges the EV batteries. The change in EV output power (∆PEVi) depends on the EV gain (KEVi) and its regulation capacity (REVi). The allowable variation in EV power exchange is limited to ± 5 kW. Figure2(a) illustrates a schematic of how aggregated EV units’ interface with the grid system having charging and discharging patterns in 2(b)17.

The AVR-LFC structure is modeled using standard transfer function-based representations, incorporating nonlinearities such as generation rate constraints (GRC) and governor dead band (GDB) effects. The input-output pairing for both AVR and LFC loops is explicitly defined to establish the control structure for the MPC implementation. Additionally, the electric vehicle (EV) module is modeled as an aggregated V2G system with bidirectional power exchange governed by a proportional control law, accounting for EV gain and regulation limits. The Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) is described using its voltage source converter (VSC)-based configuration, and its role in real and reactive power balancing is discussed. Furthermore, practical aspects such as time-delay in Area Control Error (ACE) signal transmission are addressed by incorporating time-lag elements into the control loop. These detailed modeling refinements contribute to a more realistic and implementable control design.

MPC is an effective control technique for complex systems having linear as well as non-linear dynamics as it can handle multiple inputs and outputs. In any power system model, there are always going to be some nonlinearities, uncertainties, and external disturbances, therefore, MPC is required in such systems to provide adequate compensation for these undesirable factors. MPC block has two major parts, prediction unit and control unit. The prediction unit is accountable for the forecasting of plant output in the current scenario where the information about dynamical model and array of control sequence is present for a given prediction horizon. While the control unit calculates the future control actions based on the predicted output data and the control calculations are carried out in an optimal way while minimizing a cost function (J).

H1andH2are the limits on the set of predicted samples, M is the limit on the control sequence,is the prediction error between reference output and predicted output values, andis the incremental control input sequence. To obtain the values of the optimal control sequence, the optimizer will resolve this cost function (CF) for each sample of time.o1andc1are the CF weights attached with inaccuracy in predicted output estimates and change in consecutive input samples, respectively. The penalty for each input and error value is determined by these weights. If the weight with any arbitrary predicted error is more, the controller will act to restrict the output from moving away from its set-point value. Likewise, if the coefficient associated with any given input is greater, then the MPC will prohibit its deviation from the initial value. Penalty on the rate of shift of control is also used to penalize the difference between the current and prior values of input. Along with these weights, an additional weight (d1) has been used to set a penalizing factor on the incremental shift of the input vector. The MPC controller can manage numerous objectives while handling multi-loop problems if the cost function weights are properly tuned. All of these weights can have values ranging from zero to one, and their values can be modified with the help of a meta-heuristic algorithm to achieve the desired results34,35. The basic structure for MPC based on the HHO algorithm is provided in Fig.3.

The prediction horizon refers to the number of future output samples considered during optimization, while the control horizon indicates the number of future control actions to be optimized. The prediction error represents the difference between the reference signal and the predicted output at each future step. The control increment reflects the change in control input between successive time steps. Additionally, the cost function includes penalty weights that govern the trade-off between output tracking performance, control signal variation, and the rate of change of control input. These weights are tuned using the HHO algorithm to achieve optimal dynamic performance while ensuring system stability and smooth control action.

The HHO algorithm is a nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization procedure that is based on the searching and attacking methods used by the Harris’ Hawks when they are chasing prey (Food). Harris’ Hawk is a rare clever Hawk species that hunts for food in groups and uses some unique chasing and fighting methods in the process. Due to the imbalance between exploration and exploitation stages, many algorithms tend to suffer from local convergence, failing to deliver a global optimum solution. However, unlike these algorithms, the HHO method achieves remarkable convergence in a minimal number of iterations and is not constrained by this issue37. Furthermore, the HHO approach is straightforward to execute, as it lacks its own control parameters to define, while still ensuring an excellent result in a single run. The phases of the HHO algorithm are as discussed in28.

Among various meta-heuristic algorithms available for controller tuning, the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm has been selected for this study due to its superior convergence behavior, simplicity, and robustness in handling non-linear, high-dimensional optimization problems. Unlike traditional methods that may get trapped in local optima or require manual parameter tuning, HHO offers a self-adaptive and parameter-free mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation during the search process. Its group-based hunting strategy mimics the intelligent behavior of Harris’ hawks and has been successfully applied in control engineering domains. These characteristics make it a suitable choice for optimizing the cost function weights in the MPC framework. The effectiveness of HHO in power system applications is also supported by recent studies28,34,38.

To assess the effectiveness of the proposed MPC-HHO control strategy, simulations were conducted for three operating scenarios in a deregulated power system setup consisting of six GENCOs and six DISCOs. The evaluated cases include: (i) poolco transactions, (ii) bilateral contracts, and (iii) contract violation conditions. For each case, the dynamic behavior of the system was analyzed using the proposed HHO-tuned MPC controller and compared with other controllers, namely, the conventional PID controller (tuned with HHO), the fractional-order PIλDF controller24, and two additional MPC controllers optimized via the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA).

All controllers were tuned to minimizing a performance index as described in earlier studies28,38. The performance of each control strategy was evaluated based on key dynamic response parameters: settling time (ST), peak overshoot (PO), peak undershoot (PU), and an aggregated figure of demerit (FOD), computed using Eq. (2). This figure serves as a comprehensive indicator of transient quality, where lower FOD values signify better system damping and faster stabilization.

In this form of power transaction, DISCO has the freedom to sign contracts with GENCOs from the same area. As per the DPM given in reference24the loads of DISCOs in area 1 will be supplied by the GENCOs of area 1. The area participation factor for all GENCOs is the same in this case and is equal to 1/3. The incremental change in generation from each GENCO is calculated using Eq. (3).

Here,is the corresponding load demand fromkthDISCO. The optimal control parameters for HHO, WOA, and PSO tuned MPC controllers along with HHO tuned PID controller are given in Table1. After implementing these controllers, their transient response has been obtained and compared in Table2. Due to space constraints, the transient response characteristics for area 1 of the controlled AVR-LFC system under poolco transaction only are provided in Fig.4.

Based on the transient response results obtained in Table2, it can be noted that the MPC based controllers have exhibited very small oscillations and settling time for system frequency and terminal voltage as compared with conventional PID and PIλDF24controllers, which are already reported in existing literature. Also, the MPC based on HHO algorithm has produced superior response as compared to PSO and WOA based MPC controllers, as the FOD (Figure of Demerit) has minimum value of 385.75 with respect to the MPC-HHO controlled system. The FOD value corresponding to MPC-HHO controlled system is 14.84% and 54.07% less as compared to that of MPC-WOA and MPC-PSO algorithms, respectively. The improvement in results demonstrates the effectiveness of HHO algorithm in providing genuine balance of exploration and exploitation processes in the search space.

In this power transaction, DISCO has the freedom to have contracts with GENCOs from all areas. The contracted demand of each DISCO will be 0.01 pu MW, the DPM for bilateral case is given in24. The area participation factor for all GENCOs is 0.4, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.25, and 0.3, respectively. And the incremental generation from each GENCO is calculated using Eq. (3) and is 0.012 pu MW, 0.0075 pu MW, 0.0105 pu MW, 0.0135 pu MW, 0.0075 pu MW, and 0.009 pu MW, respectively. For this case, the optimal control parameters for HHO, WOA, and PSO tuned MPC controllers along with HHO tuned PID controller are specified in Table3. After employing these controllers, their transient response has been acquired and evaluated in Table4.

PID and MPC parameter values obtained after applying various meta-heuristic algorithm.

In comparison to conventional PID and PIλDF controller reported in existing body of work24, MPC based controllers have shown very trivial oscillations and settling time for system frequency and terminal voltage, as shown in Fig.5. The graphical plots are shown for area 1 only. In addition to this, the HHO algorithm has shown a significant improvement in overall system performance, with the FOD (figure of demerit) having a minimum value of 882.492.

In this power transaction, DISCO1will demand extra power of 0.01 pu MW, therefore, the contract will be violated. This total uncontracted demand for DISCO1will result in increased total load of area 1 (0.04 pu MW). The area participation factor for all GENCOs is 0.4, 0.25, 0.35, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively. Here, the local load for area 1 will increase to 0.04 pu MW, which will result in varied incremental generation values from each GENCO. For this case, the optimal control parameters for HHO, WOA, and PSO tuned MPC controllers along with HHO tuned PID controller are given in Table5. The transient response characteristics obtained after implementing these controllers are provided in Fig.6.

Transient response plots for controlled AVR-LFC system under contract violation case.

Based on the transient response results obtained in Table6, it can be observed that MPC based controllers have demonstrated very small oscillations and settling time for system frequency and terminal voltage as compared with conventional PID and PIλDF controllers24. Also, the significant improvement in overall performance of the system has been observed with the aid of HHO algorithm, where the FOD has a minimum value of 904.61, which is 8.9% and 8.85% less as compared to PSO and WOA based MPC control schemes, respectively.

Results indicate that the HHO algorithm achieves faster convergence, requiring significantly fewer iterations to reach optimal cost function values. Specifically, for a standard prediction horizon and sampling configuration, the HHO-based tuning reduced the average computational load by approximately 30–40% compared to PSO and WOA. This efficiency can be attributed to the adaptive exploration-exploitation balance and parameter-free nature of the HHO framework. Additionally, the implementation complexity of the proposed control scheme is minimal, as the HHO algorithm does not rely on extensive parameter tuning and integrates seamlessly with the MPC formulation. These findings support the suitability of the MPC-HHO controller for real-time deployment in smart grid environments where computational efficiency is critical.

In this case, the IPFC and EV blocks have been added into the MPC-HHO controlled system for auxiliary control against frequency oscillations in the system. For poolco and bilateral transaction cases discussed in previous subsection, the controller parameters of MPC have been re-evaluated in the coordination with IPFC and IPFC-EV units and are listed in Table7. Further, the transient response from each case has been evaluated for MPC-HHO method with IPFC and EV integration.

Optimal MPC coordinated with IPFC, and IPFC-EV parameter values obtained after applying HHO algorithm.

From the plots in Figs.7and8, it can be observed that the overall system performance has enhanced due to the application of IPFC-EV in coordination with MPC-HHO algorithm. Although the simulation results have shown marginal improvement in voltage profile of the system, the frequency profile has improved considerably. From Table8, it can be observed that the oscillations in frequency error for both areas have reduced significantly for bilateral transaction and poolco transaction cases when IPFC and EV integrated MPC-HHO controller has been implemented.

Performance comparison of the IPFC and EV integrated MPC-HHO controlled systems.

To evaluate the dynamic behavior and inherent stability of the proposed control approach, eigenvalue analysis of the closed-loop system has been carried out. This method provides insight into the system’s responsiveness by examining the real parts of the eigenvalues associated with the state-space model. For a system to be stable, all eigenvalues must lie in the left half of the complex plane. The eigenvalue spectrum derived for the MPC-HHO controlled AVR-LFC system in Table9confirms this condition, indicating asymptotic stability. Furthermore, the comparative assessment with other controller configurations reveals that the MPC-HHO setup consistently results in eigenvalues with larger negative real parts, signifying faster damping of oscillatory modes and superior transient characteristics.

Eigen values obtained for MPC-HHO controlled system under different cases.

Multiple zero-valued eigenvalues observed in Table9correspond to integrator states or non-dominant modes inherent to the AVR-LFC system model. These eigenvalues are typical in systems involving integral control action and do not compromise system stability, as all dominant eigenvalues lie well within the left half of the complex plane, ensuring asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.

In this analysis, the DPM matrix for bilateral case has been varied to DPM A and DPM B and the obtained response has been recorded as per the controller settlings discussed in subsection 4.2 (Table7). As depicted in Fig.9, the robust nature of the proposed MPC-HHO controller scheme in coordination with IPFC and EV has allowed the system response to settle smoothly while maintaining quality transient response.

Time-response characteristics under different DPM matrices for bilateral transaction case.

The robustness of the proposed MPC-HHO algorithm coordinated with IPFC-EV has been verified after observing the effect of changes in contract violation. The contract violation value in area 1 has been varied from 1 to 3% and its impact on the transient functioning of the controlled system has been recorded and plotted in Fig.10. It can be noted that the transient response of the controlled system displays some added oscillations, but the robustness of the suggested algorithm has permitted these transients to settle down in a very quick period.

Transient response plots after considering variations in the contract violation.

In practical power systems, delays in signal transmission and control action are inevitable due to sensor latency, communication constraints, and processing overheads. These time delays, particularly in the computation and execution of Area Control Error (ACE) signals, can adversely impact the stability and dynamic response of automatic generation control systems. Therefore, evaluating the performance of the proposed MPC-HHO controller under such delay conditions is essential to confirm its robustness.

To examine this, time delays were introduced into the control loop by applying a defined lag to the ACE feedback signal. The transient response of the system was then analyzed to determine any degradation in performance. As shown in Fig.11, increased delays lead to minor elongation in the settling time and slight deviations in overshoot values. However, the proposed controller maintains overall system stability and continues to effectively mitigate frequency and voltage oscillations, demonstrating its resilience to typical communication and processing delays. This validates the applicability of the HHO-optimized MPC scheme in real-time deployment scenarios where latency cannot be ignored.

This case presents the simulation study of bilateral transaction case under the influence of variable loading. Herein the robust nature of IPFC-EV assisted MPC-HHO controller has been tested under randomly varying loading patterns. The step load perturbation in area 1 has been replaced by randomly changing step load, and its effect on the frequency and voltage profile of the system has been observed. In Fig.12, the sudden spikes in frequency deviation plots of area 1 and 2 can be seen, however, the voltage profile remains unperturbed.

Plots of the time-response obtained after considering random loading case.

This study presents a Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)-based Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for coordinated voltage and frequency regulation in a wind-integrated, deregulated multi-area power system. The proposed MPC-HHO framework was tested under various market scenarios; poolco, bilateral, and contract violation—and consistently demonstrated superior transient performance compared to conventional PID, PIλDF, and other meta-heuristic-tuned MPC schemes. Integration of auxiliary components such as the Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) further improved frequency stability and system resilience under dynamic loading and renewable intermittency. Robustness of the control scheme was validated through extensive sensitivity analyses, including variations in DISCO Participation Matrix (DPM), contract violations, time delays, and random loading patterns. Eigenvalue analysis confirmed the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Overall, the results highlight the potential of the proposed MPC-HHO strategy as a viable solution for automatic generation control in deregulated and renewable-rich power systems. Future research may focus on incorporating stochastic modeling of renewable sources, cyber-physical layer interactions, and real-time implementation using hardware-in-the-loop platforms for practical smart grid applications.
