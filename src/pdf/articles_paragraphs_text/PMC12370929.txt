mRNA decapping enzyme 2 (DCP2) is a key regulator of mRNA degradation, influencing RNA metabolism and gene expression. While implicated in various diseases, its role in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study explores DCP2 as a potential biomarker for HCC through bioinformatics and experimental analyses. Public databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEPIA2 online database, revealed significant DCP2 upregulation in HCC tissues, correlating with Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging, histological grading, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Prognostic analysis confirmed high DCP2 expression as an indicator of poor overall survival (OS). Functional enrichment analyses linked DCP2 to cancer-associated pathways, including PI3K/Akt, Hippo signaling, cholesterol metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Immune infiltration analysis showed significant correlations with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), suggesting a role in immune modulation. Experimental validation via western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed elevated DCP2 expression in HCC cell lines and tissues. These findings suggest that DCP2 may be involved in HCC progression by influencing mRNA degradation, cancer-related signaling, and the immune microenvironment. Although DCP2 shows potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, as well as a therapeutic target, further functional studies—such as gene knockdown and overexpression experiments—are needed to confirm its mechanistic role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with over 900,000 new cases and 830,000 deaths estimated in 20201. Despite significant advances in understanding HCC pathogenesis, the role of post-transcriptional gene regulation in HCC development remains insufficiently elucidated. The mRNA-decapping enzyme 2 (DCP2) is a key executor of 5′-cap removal in mRNA turnover, an essential step in 5′→3′ mRNA decay that halts translation and commits transcripts to degradation2. Dysregulation of mRNA decapping has been implicated in multiple cancer types, influencing gene expression networks critical for tumor progression3,4. In this study, we investigate the expression and functional significance of DCP2 in HCC and its potential role in tumorigenesis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 75–85% of primary liver cancers and remains a major global health burden due to its poor prognosis and limited treatment options1–5. Despite advancements in early detection and therapeutic interventions, HCC continues to exhibit high recurrence rates and resistance to treatment, making it one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide1. The complexity of HCC pathogenesis involves multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, including mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, epigenetic modifications, dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways, and changes in RNA stability6. While significant research has focused on transcriptional regulation in HCC, post-transcriptional gene regulation via RNA degradation mechanisms remains underexplored7.

Through this decapping activity, DCP2 controls the stability and lifespan of specific transcripts, thereby influencing gene expression programs8. The active enzyme of the decapping complex is the bilobed Nudix family enzyme Dcp2, which hydrolyzes 5’ cap and releases 7mGDP and a 5’-monophosphorylated mRNA8. Notably, DCP2-mediated decapping is not indiscriminate; it acts in a transcript-selective manner, often regulated by cofactors and RNA-binding proteins. For example, DCP2 has been shown to modulate the stability of interferon-related mRNAs such as IRF7, dampening antiviral immune responses by accelerating IRF7 mRNA decay9. This indicates DCP2 can interface with immune signaling pathways via selective mRNA degradation.Given its role as an mRNA stability gatekeeper, DCP2 has been implicated in the biology of cancer and other diseases. In a Drosophila model, DCP2 was identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene, where loss-of-function mutations led to unchecked tissue growth10. In human cancers, emerging evidence suggests a context-dependent role for DCP2. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a recent study discovered a microRNA (miR-4293) that directly targets DCP2, leading to reduced DCP2 levels and consequent upregulation of the oncogenic long noncoding RNA WFDC21P, which promotes tumor proliferation11. This finding implies that DCP2 can act as a suppressor of pro-tumorigenic transcripts (such as WFDC21P) in lung cancer. By contrast, in malignant gliomas, DCP2 appears to function more like an oncogenic factor: DCP2 expression is significantly elevated in glioma tissues compared to normal brain, and high DCP2 levels were shown to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis12. Functional assays in glioma cell lines demonstrated that DCP2 overexpression enhanced proliferation, invasion and migration, while inhibiting apoptosis, whereas DCP2 knockdown had opposite effects12. Furthermore, glioma tumors with high DCP2 showed distinct immune microenvironment changes, including positive correlation with immunosuppressive cytokines IL-6 and IL-7 and overall higher immune cell infiltration12. Additionally, studies have reported that metformin (Metformin) can inhibit tumor growth and upregulate a group of anti-tumor genes involved in DNA-binding transcription activator activity, hormonal response, and the regulation of the Dcp1-Dcp2 mRNA decapping complex13. A recent study by Gaviraghi revealed that the mRNA decapping coactivator PNRC1 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating ribosome biogenesis. PNRC1 relocates the Dcp1/Dcp2 mRNA decapping complex to the nucleolus and promotes the decapping of specific snoRNAs, thereby disrupting ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. By slowing down rRNA maturation and subsequently reducing ribosome biogenesis, PNRC1 acts as a gatekeeper to suppress oncogenic potential14–35.This suggests that the decapping complex is closely associated with tumor progression.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of DCP2’s molecular characteristics and its relevance to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multiple online databases. Our findings demonstrated that DCP2 is significantly differentially expressed in HCC. To further explore its clinical significance, we systematically assessed its expression profile and prognostic value through single-gene correlation analysis, differential expression analysis, functional enrichment, and immune infiltration analysis. The expression levels of DCP2 in HCC cell lines, tumor tissues, and normal liver tissues were evaluated using western blotting, RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF). Additionally, we analyzed clinical samples to investigate the association between DCP2 expression levels and clinicopathological features, peripheral blood serum biomarkers, and patient prognosis. Our results suggest that DCP2 shows potential as a prognostic biomarker in HCC. However, its clinical utility warrants further validation in independent cohorts and through ROC curve analyses. Moreover, while DCP2 may be explored as a therapeutic target, additional functional and mechanistic studies are needed to confirm its role in HCC progression.

A total of 85 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received treatment at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (First Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University) from January 2014 to December 2022 were included in this study. Missing data were carefully examined prior to analysis. Samples with missing key variables were excluded from the respective analyses.Clinical data, including age, sex, history of alcohol consumption, tumor staging, degree of differentiation, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, were analyzed using chi-square tests or t-tests for group comparisons, and Cox proportional hazards models for univariate and multivariate survival analyses. Tumor and peritumoral tissue samples were collected for analysis. Tissue samples were systematically selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure representativeness and minimize selection bias. Tissue samples used for western blot (WB) analysis were immediately placed on ice after surgical resection, sampled under aseptic conditions, and preserved in liquid nitrogen.

The |log2FC| (5% CO₂ ) threshold was set to 1, and the adjusted p-value was set below 0.01. This analysis focused on comparing DCP2 expression levels between tumor and normal tissues, as well as across different stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To further quantify DCP2 expression in tumor and normal tissues, additional analysis was conducted using the ENCORI online database (https://rnasysu.com/encori/)19. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation of the potential relationship between DCP2 expression and HCC clinical staging was performed using the UALCAN online platform (https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/)20.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter online tool (https://kmplot.com/analysis/)21to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and log-rank p-value for DCP2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This analysis aimed to assess the impact of DCP2 expression on overall survival (OS) and post-progression survival (PPS) in HCC patients. Data for HCC were obtained from the OncoLnc database (http://www.oncolnc.org/)22, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves for OS were generated using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DCP2 was constructed using the STRING database (http://string-db.org)23with a confidence score cutoff of 0.40 for interaction inclusion and visualization.

The results were presented in bubble plots and bar charts for clear visualization.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)26: The GSEA function in the clusterProfiler package was used to analyze pathway enrichment related to DCP2 expression within the sample data. This approach allowed for the identification of key pathways potentially regulated by DCP2, shedding light on its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

TIMER(http://timer.cistrome.org/)27is a comprehensive bioinformatics tool designed for the systematic analysis of immune infiltration across different cancer types using high-throughput RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)28. TIMER provides multiple modules that allow researchers to evaluate the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including B cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, in various malignancies. By leveraging statistical modeling approaches, TIMER corrects for tumor purity and estimates the relative abundance of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby offering valuable insights into the interplay between immune responses and tumor progression.

The cell lines used in this study were purchased from Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology, Inc., including LO2, Huh7, Hep3B, MHCC97H, SK-Hep1, and HepG2. These cells were maintained under standard culture conditions using Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). The base medium consisted of a combination of RPMI 1640 and DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin to prepare complete culture medium. For cell maintenance, the cells were seeded in T25 perforated cell culture flasks containing 5 mL of complete medium and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO₂. Cells in the logarithmic growth phase, which exhibit optimal proliferative characteristics, were considered suitable for subsequent experimental procedures.All the mentioned materials were sourced from China Wuhan Punosai Biological Company.

Total RNA was extracted from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, adjacent normal tissues, and HCC cell lines using the FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Primer efficiency was validated by performing qPCR on serial dilutions of cDNA templates to generate standard curves. The efficiency of each primer pair was calculated based on the slope of the curve, and only primers with efficiencies between 90% and 110% were selected for subsequent experiments.

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China), followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China) on an ABI QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The 2^(-ΔΔCt) method was employed to determine the relative RNA expression levels, with GAPDH serving as the internal reference gene for normalization. The sequences of all primers used in this study are provided in Table1.

Total proteins were extracted from Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, adjacent normal tissues, and cell lines using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, China). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Beyotime, China). Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (Epizyme, China) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature, washed with TBST, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies including anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, China) and anti-DCP2 (Proteintech, China). After washing three times with TBST, membranes were incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with TBST, protein bands were detected using an Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Ncmbio, China) on a Tanon-5200 multifunctional imaging system. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software with GAPDH as the loading control.

Immunohistochemical staining was independently evaluated by two pathologists blinded to the clinical information. Cells were seeded onto round coverslips placed in 6-well plates and cultured for 2–3 days. After removing the medium was aspirated and PBS was used to rinse the cells and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by three washes with cold PBS. Permeabilization was performed using 0.1–0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. To block nonspecific binding, cells were incubated with 10% goat serum (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 30 min. Primary antibody incubation was carried out at 4 °C overnight. After PBS washing, cells were incubated with TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beyotime, China) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and coverslips were mounted using an anti-fade mounting medium (Phygene, China). Fluorescent images were captured using an Olympus BX83 fluorescence microscope (Japan).

Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software (ImageJ, V1.54, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA,https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The grayscale values of the target protein bands were measured and normalized to GAPDH as the internal control. All quantifications were performed from three independent experiments.The statistical software package SPSS 25.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized to analyze the data. The chi-square test was employed to assess the independence of categorical variables. Additionally, survival disparities were assessed via Kaplan-Meier analyses. Variables exhibiting a P-value below 0.1 in the univariable analysis were incorporated into the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariable analysis. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value lower than 0.05(*:P< 0.05, **:P< 0.01, ***:P< 0.001).

DCP2 is located in band 3 of region 2 on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q21.3) (Fig.1A). The DCP2 gene encodes mRNA-decapping enzyme 2, which is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, with enrichment in processing bodies (P-bodies) within the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in mRNA degradation (Fig.1B). Comprehensive gene-disease interaction analysis indicates that DCP2 is associated with multiple pathological conditions, including neurological disorders, metabolic abnormalities, and immune-related diseases (Fig.1C). Studies have shown that aberrant RNA metabolism regulation and mRNA stability control may contribute to tumorigenesis. Pan-cancer analysis based on TCGA data reveals that DCP2 is significantly upregulated in various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bladder cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. Notably, DCP2 expression is markedly higher in HCC tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal liver tissues, suggesting that DCP2 may function as an oncogenic factor and play a critical role in HCC development and progression (Fig.1D).

expression and cancer staging (P< 0.05, Fig.2C). Additionally, DCP2 expression levels were also significantly associated with TP53 mutations (P< 0.05, Fig.2D). Furthermore, GEPIA database analysis revealed that DCP2 expression levels varied significantly across different stages of HCC (F = 2.84, Pr(> F) = 0.0235, Fig.2E).

The GEPIA database was used to analyze the correlation between DCP2 expression levels in microarray data and survival outcomes—including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)—in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The results indicated that patients with high DCP2 expression had significantly shorter OS and DFS compared to those with low expression (Fig.3A/B). Further analysis based on the Oncolnc database confirmed the significant association between DCP2 expression levels and HCC patient prognosis. Specifically, high DCP2 expression was significantly correlated with shorter OS (P< 0.001)(Fig.3C).Subsequently, we employed the Kaplan-Meier (KM) online analysis platform to evaluate the relationship between DCP2 expression levels and survival outcomes in HCC patients. The findings were consistent with the GEPIA analysis, demonstrating that patients with high DCP2 expression had significantly worse OS and DFS than those with low expression (Fig.3D/E). To further explore this, we conducted a KM survival analysis using TIMER. Notably, the expression level of DCP2 also differed significantly between genders, suggesting that sex-related factors may play a role in its regulation (Fig.3F/G).Overall, these results indicate that DCP2 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC, and monitoring its expression levels could help guide personalized treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.

Using the STRING database, we constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DCP2 (Fig.4A) and identified 10 high-confidence interacting proteins, many of which are associated with mRNA degradation, RNA metabolism regulation, and cancerprogression.Among them, XRN1 (0.999), a5’-3’ exoribonuclease, plays a key role in mRNA decay and hasbeen reported to influence RNA stability in various cancers. DCP1B (0.999) is involved in mRNA5’ decapping, promoting aberrant RNA degradation, which may affect gene expression regulation in cancer cells. PATL1 (0.999), a scaffold protein for the decapping complex, regulates mRNA degradation and is also linked to P-body formation and viral RNA replication, with potential implications in HCC and other cancers through RNA metabolism regulation.

Additionally, EDC4 (0.999) functions as a promoter of the DCP1-DCP2 complex, enhancing DCP2 decapping activity, and may play a critical role in RNA metabolism-related cancers, such as HCC and breast cancer. DCP1A (0.999), beyond facilitating mRNA 5’ decapping, is also involved in TGF-β1-mediated tumor signaling, with studies suggesting its potential role in tumor progression and increased invasiveness. Other interacting proteins, such as DDX6 (0.999), have been confirmed to participate in RNA metabolism and autophagy regulation in multiple cancers, including HCC and colorectal cancer. EDC3 (0.999), as an mRNA decapping enhancer, may influence cancer cell transcriptional regulation. CNOT7 (0.997), a key deadenylase of the CCR4-NOT complex, regulates mRNA degradation and miRNA-mediated gene silencing, and has been implicated in colorectal and breast cancer.Additionally, LSM1 (0.991) may influence cancer cell proliferation through RNA metabolism regulation, with reported roles in breast cancer, liver cancer, and cervical cancer. EIF4E (0.990), a translation initiation factor, is highly expressed in various cancers, including HCC, and is associated with poor prognosis.In summary, these DCP2-interacting proteins play crucial roles in mRNA degradation, RNA metabolism, and tumor microenvironment regulation, potentially contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other malignancies by affecting RNA stability and post-transcriptional regulation.

A detailed analysis of DCP2 expression and function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was conducted, and samples were classified into high-expression and low-expression groups based on their expression levels. To further explore the biological significance of DCP2 expression, a differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed using HCC samples from the GEO database (GSE14520). The screening criteria were set as |log2FC| > 1 and p-value < 0.05 to identify genes with statistically significant differential expression between the two groups. Subsequently, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to investigate the signaling pathways associated with these DEGs, providing further insight into the potential role of DCP2 in HCC progression.

KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that several key pathways were significantly enriched in the DCP2 high-expression group, including Cell cycle, ECM-receptor interaction, MicroRNAs in cancer, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. These pathways play crucial roles in cell proliferation, migration, signal transduction, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. Notably, the Hippo signaling pathway, as an essential tumor suppressor network, regulates cellular homeostasis and the YAP/TAZ transcription factor activity. DCP2 may promote HCC progression by modulating the Hippo signaling axis. Furthermore, Cholesterol metabolism and PPAR signaling pathway were also enriched, suggesting their involvement in HCC metabolic reprogramming and lipid homeostasis regulation (Fig.4B).

Additionally, GSEA analysis further revealed that in the DCP2 high-expression HCC group, significantly enriched signaling pathways included Drug metabolism - cytochrome P450, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, Oxidative phosphorylation, and Protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.4C). These pathways indicate that DCP2 may promote tumor growth and progression by influencing metabolic pathways and energy production in HCC cells.

GO enrichment analysis further demonstrated that DCP2 may regulate biological processes (BP) such as cell-cell adhesion, synapse organization, and neurotransmitter signaling, affecting HCC cell behavior. Specifically, cell adhesion is essential for maintaining tissue structure and function, and its dysregulation may lead to increased invasiveness and metastatic potential in HCC cells. Additionally, abnormalities in synapse organization and GABAergic synapse activity suggest that DCP2 might influence neural signal regulation in the tumor microenvironment.At the cellular component (CC) level, enriched structures included the immunoglobulin complex, synaptic membrane, and monoatomic ion channel complex, suggesting that DCP2 may play a role in immune regulation and tumor adaptation mechanisms in HCC. At the molecular function (MF) level, the enrichment of GABA-A receptor activity, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and gated ion channel activity indicates that DCP2 may influence HCC cell survival and adaptability by modulating ion channels and signal transduction (Fig.4D).DCP2 may function not only as an mRNA decay regulator but also as a modulator of multiple cancer-related signaling pathways (such as Hippo, PI3K-Akt, and TGF-beta) and metabolic pathways (such as cholesterol metabolism and glycolysis), influencing HCC progression. Moreover, DCP2 may play a potential role in neural adaptation and immune regulation within the HCC microenvironment, warranting further experimental validation to elucidate its molecular mechanisms and clinical significance in HCC development, progression, and drug resistance.

Following this, an examination was conducted to investigate the relationship between immune cell infiltration and the expression of the DCP2 gene in patients with HCC, based on data obtained from the TIMER database. The results were visually presented using a Lollipop plot (Fig.4E). Among the six immune cell types analyzed, a significant correlation was observed between DCP2 expression and several specific immune cell populations. The outcomes were as follows: B cells (correlation coefficient = 0.451, p-value = 0.0001), CD8 + T cells (correlation coefficient = 0.385, p-value = 0.0107), CD4 + T cells (correlation coefficient = 0.335, p-value = 0.0036), macrophages (correlation coefficient = 0.0996, p-value = 0.0004), neutrophils (correlation coefficient = 0.653, p-value = 4.28e − 05), and dendritic cells (correlation coefficient = 0.256, p-value = 0.0076). These findings suggest that DCP2 may play a role in shaping the immune microenvironment in HCC by modulating immune cell infiltration and activity. Notably, the strong correlation between DCP2 and neutrophil infiltration suggests a potential link to inflammation-mediated tumor progression. Additionally, the association of DCP2 with macrophages and dendritic cells indicates a possible involvement in antigen presentation and immune evasion mechanisms in HCC. These findings highlight DCP2 as a potential immunoregulatory factor that may contribute to tumor immune escape in HCC, warranting further investigation into its role in tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy.

To validate the positive findings obtained from bioinformatics analysis, we investigated DCP2 expression levels in HCC tissues and cell lines.First, we analyzed DCP2 RNA expression in theGSE14520database and 85 pairs of HCC tumor and adjacent normal tissues from Nantong University Affiliated Hospital. The results showed that DCP2 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues (p< 0.01), suggesting that DCP2 may play a role in promoting HCC progression (Fig.5A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining further confirmed that DCP2 protein levels were significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues (p< 0.01). IHC results demonstrated that DCP2 was mainly localized in the nucleus, with enhanced nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in HCC samples (Fig.5B).Next, we examined DCP2 mRNA expression levels in the LO2 normal liver cell line and six HCC cell lines: Huh7, Hep3B, MHCC97H, SK-Hep1, and Hep G2. The results showed that compared to LO2 cells, DCP2 expression was significantly elevated in Huh7, MHCC97H, and HepG2 cells (p< 0.01), with the highest expression observed in the Huh7 cell line (Fig.5C).western blot (WB) analysis further verified DCP2 protein expression levels in HCC tissues and cell lines. The results indicated that DCP2 protein levels were significantly higher in HCC tissues and cell lines compared to normal liver tissues (p< 0.01), which was consistent with the mRNA expression trends (Fig.5D). we performed densitometric analysis of Western blot bands from three independent experiments using ImageJ software (Fig.5E). western blot analysis was also performed to determine the DCP2 protein expression profile in LIHC (liver cancer) tissues. The grayscale quantification revealed that DCP2 protein levels were significantly elevated in six fresh HCC tissue samples compared to corresponding normal liver tissues (p< 0.01), further supporting the role of DCP2 in HCC progression (Fig.5G).Finally, immunofluorescence (IF) analysis was conducted to examine DCP2 localization in LO2 and Huh7 cell lines(Fig.5F). The results demonstrated that DCP2 was widely distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a predominant nuclear localization (Fig.1B), which was consistent with the WB and IHC findings.By integrating bioinformatics analysis, clinical sample validation, and experimental studies, we confirmed that DCP2 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Both mRNA and protein levels exhibited a high expression trend, with DCP2 widely distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HCC cells. These findings are consistent with bioinformatics predictions and suggest that DCP2 may play a crucial role in HCC development, progression, and signaling regulation.

(HCC is Hepatocellular Carcinoma tumour tissue, Liver is adjacent normal hiver tissu). (G) The western-blot analysis was conducted to assess the levels of DCP2 expression in 6 pairs of HCC tissues and their corresponding normal tissues.

To investigate the relationship between DCP2 expression levels and the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC, all HCC patients were categorized into high-expression and low-expression groups based on DCP2 expression levels (Table2). The analysis revealed that DCP2 expression was significantly associated with TNM stage (P= 0.008), pathological grade (P= 0.04), gender (P= 0.04), and AFP levels (P= 0.03). These findings suggest that DCP2 may play a crucial role in HCC progression and serve as a potential prognostic marker.Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed between DCP2 expression levels and patient age (P= 0.45), drinking history (P= 0.063), peripheral blood NLR (P= 0.5), or PLR (P= 0.2) (P> 0.05). This indicates that while DCP2 expression may be primarily involved in disease progression, its direct association with these clinical factors appears to be limited.

To further evaluate the independent prognostic impact of DCP2 expression on the survival of HCC patients, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed (Table3). Univariate analysis revealed that high DCP2 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.20–2.70,P= 0.004). After adjusting for other clinical factors, multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that high DCP2 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for poor survival (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.05–2.15,P= 0.03).In addition, TNM stage (HR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.30–3.10,P= 0.001), pathological grade (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.05–2.15,P= 0.028), and NLR level (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.05–2.10,P= 0.025) were also significantly associated with prognosis in multivariate analysis. However, age, gender, drinking history, and PLR levels did not show statistical significance in multivariate analysis (P> 0.05).Overall, these findings suggest that high DCP2 expression may serve as an independent prognostic predictor of poor survival in HCC patients, highlighting its potential role in disease progression and personalized treatment strategies.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with limited treatment options and a high recurrence rate29. Despite advancements in targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC progression remain largely unclear. Our study demonstrates that the significant upregulation of DCP2, a key component of the mRNA decapping complex, is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that DCP2 may function as an oncogene in HCC. Through multiple mechanisms, including RNA stability regulation, signaling pathway modulation, and immune microenvironment alterations, DCP2 may promote tumor progression.

DCP2 plays a crucial role in mRNA degradation by removing the 5’ cap structure, a key step in RNA decay29. Dysregulation of mRNA degradation has been linked to various cancers, as alterations in RNA stability affect the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The observed upregulation of DCP2 in our study suggests that it may preferentially target tumor suppressor transcripts for degradation, thereby promoting HCC progression. Previous studies have also indicated that regulators of mRNA stability significantly influence the expression of key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

Currently, research on DCP2 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is extremely limited, with no dedicated literature available on this subject. However, DCP2 is broadly expressed in various human organs and tissues, including the cerebellum, thymus, prostate, and placenta, indicating that its function extends beyond reproductive biology. As a core enzyme in the mRNA decapping complex, DCP2 is essential for RNA degradation. Recent research has highlighted that DCP2 is involved not only in RNA metabolism but also in antiviral defense, tumor progression, immune regulation30and drug resistance31.

In antiviral immunity, DCP2 depletion has been shown to significantly enhance cellular resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus and coxsackievirus32. RNA sequencing analyses have revealed that DCP2 deficiency leads to upregulation of multiple antiviral genes, including transcription factors, cytokines, viral RNA/DNA receptors, and antiviral proteins, which participate in various stages of viral entry, recognition, and degradation, ultimately inhibiting viral infection and replication33. Thus, DCP2 may serve as a potential target for inducing intrinsic antiviral responses. However, given that DCP2 is highly expressed in the male reproductive system, knockout studies in mice have demonstrated that DCP2 deficiency results in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility. Consequently, DCP2-targeted antiviral therapies must be precisely designed to avoid adverse effects on reproductive function.

In the field of oncology, DCP2 plays distinct roles across different malignancies, including lung cancer, gliomas, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated cancers34and other tumors. In lung cancer, miR-4293 inhibits DCP2, leading to upregulation of lncRNA WFDC21P, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while METTL3-mediated m6A modification induces DCP2 degradation, enhancing small cell lung cancer (SCLC) drug resistance through the Pink1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway35. In gliomas, DCP2 overexpression promotes tumor proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and is associated with IL-6/IL-7-mediated immune infiltration12, suggesting a role in tumor immune evasion. In EBV-associated cancers, the m6A-binding protein YTHDF1 recruits DCP2 to degrade EBV RNA36affecting viral oncogenesis. Furthermore, in other cancer types, the tumor suppressor PNRC1 recruits DCP2 to regulate rRNA maturation, thereby inhibiting MYC-driven proliferation37.

Regarding immune regulation and drug resistance, DCP2 may act as a key regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing immune cell infiltration and chemotherapy resistance. Studies suggest that METTL3-mediated DCP2 degradation enhances drug resistance in SCLC, while metformin inhibits mTORC1 to upregulate ZFP36, promoting mRNA degradation13potentially altering chemotherapy sensitivity through DCP2. Taken together, these findings highlight DCP2 as a central regulator of RNA metabolism, with critical roles in antiviral defense, tumor progression, TME modulation, and drug resistance. Given the heterogeneous expression and function of DCP2 across different cancers, targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating DCP2 activity may provide new directions for cancer treatment and antiviral therapies.

Future investigations will focus on elucidating the comprehensive mechanisms by which DCP2 contributes to HCC. By leveraging The Cancer Genome Atlas GEO database(GSE14520) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, we aim to identify key co-expressed genes that interact with DCP2 in a complex regulatory network, collectively driving HCC progression. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that DCP2 is significantly associated with the Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, cell cycle regulation, and mRNA metabolism pathways. Dysregulation of these pathways is known to promote HCC progression. Our findings suggest that DCP2 may disrupt the Hippo pathway by destabilizing tumor suppressor mRNAs, thereby enhancing YAP/TAZ activity and facilitating tumor progression. Additionally, DCP2 may activate the PI3K/Akt pathway by degrading negative regulators such as PTEN or FOXO family members, promoting HCC cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance. We also assessed the correlation between DCP2 expression and immune cell infiltration based on the TCGA dataset. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between DCP2 expression and multiple immune cell types, including B cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, and macrophages. This finding suggests that DCP2 may regulate the immune microenvironment of HCC by influencing immune cell recruitment and function. Notably, the strong correlation between DCP2 and neutrophil infiltration indicates that DCP2 may play a crucial role in inflammation-driven tumor progression. Furthermore, the association between DCP2 and macrophages/dendritic cells suggests that DCP2 may be involved in antigen presentation and immune evasion mechanisms, potentially helping tumors escape immune surveillance. These findings further support the notion that DCP2 may act as an immune regulatory factor in HCC, highlighting its potential role in tumor immune evasion and response to immunotherapy, which warrants further investigation into its immune-related oncogenic mechanisms.

We initially used GEPIA2 to validate that DCP2 expression is significantly elevated in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. western blot analysis further confirmed this finding, showing that DCP2 expression is upregulated in most HCC cell lines (Huh7, Hep3B, MHCC97H, SK-Hep1, Hepa1-6, and HepG2) compared to normal hepatocytes (L02). Additionally, primary HCC tissues also exhibited higher DCP2 expression than adjacent normal tissues. UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis revealed a significant correlation between DCP2 expression and different HCC stages, with higher DCP2 levels associated with worse overall and post-progression survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical data collection further indicated that DCP2 expression correlates with TNM staging and histological grading in HCC. Survival analysis confirmed that elevated DCP2 expression is associated with poorer overall survival (P= 0.0034). Univariate Cox regression analysis identified DCP2 as a potential prognostic factor in HCC. However, this association did not remain statistically significant in the multivariate analysis, which may be attributed to factors such as limited sample size, potential confounding clinical variables, and the inherent constraints of single-center follow-up. These limitations may have reduced the statistical power to detect independent prognostic effects. Future studies involving larger, multi-center cohorts and longer follow-up durations are needed to validate the prognostic role of DCP2.

This study also assessed inflammation-related indicators, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)38and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)39. Chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in cancer initiation and progression and has been recognized as the seventh hallmark of cancer. The link between chronic inflammation and cancer dates back 160 years, and recent studies further underscore its importance in oncogenesis. NLR has been established as a biomarker for high-risk HCC patients, predicting lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. A meta-analysis confirmed that elevated NLR correlates with worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in HCC patients, findings consistent with our results. The prognostic value of PLR remains controversial, with some studies supporting its diagnostic potential, while others suggest its limited clinical relevance. AFP, a widely used serum biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis, is associated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and poor survival. Our analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between high DCP2 expression and increased AFP levels, further supporting DCP2’s role in HCC progression.

Although our study provides compelling evidence for the oncogenic role of DCP2 in HCC, certain limitations must be acknowledged. Future studies should utilize in vivo models and clinical samples to validate these findings. The limited sample size in this study may affect statistical power, especially for multivariate analysis. Future studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up are needed to validate our findings. Additionally, the specific mRNA targets degraded by DCP2 in HCC remain unclear, and high-throughput RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) could help identify these key transcripts. Given the diverse roles of DCP2 across different cancer types, further research is needed to explore its tumor-specific functions. Our findings identify DCP2 as a novel oncogenic factor in HCC, emphasizing its role in mRNA degradation, oncogenic signaling activation, and immune microenvironment modulation, suggesting that DCP2 may serve as both a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

In summary, this study comprehensively analyzed the expression pattern and prognostic significance of DCP2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results indicate that DCP2 is significantly upregulated in HCC tumors, whereas its expression is relatively lower in normal liver tissues. Notably, DCP2 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. This study provides a solid foundation supporting the potential role of DCP2 as a prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To further validate the prognostic value of DCP2, future studies should include larger cohorts of at least 200–300 patients to ensure sufficient statistical power for multivariate analyses. Additionally, extending follow-up durations to a minimum of 3–5 years would allow for a more accurate assessment of long-term survival outcomes. These measures, combined with investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms of DCP2 in HCC progression, are essential to comprehensively understand its clinical significance and therapeutic potential.

Building upon the findings of this study, several promising avenues for future research can be proposed. First, more comprehensive functional studies, such as DCP2 knockdown and overexpression in various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, are necessary to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which DCP2 regulates tumor progression. Moreover, integrating multi-omics data and advanced bioinformatics tools can further clarify the complex regulatory networks involving DCP2, as demonstrated in recent studies on biomedical engineering and pharmacology40,41.

Additionally, the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in analyzing large-scale genomic and clinical data, such as those presented in recent computational studies42,43holds great potential to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets related to DCP2 and HCC. Our methodologies, including protein-protein interaction network analysis and immunohistochemistry validation, can be integrated into these computational frameworks to improve prediction accuracy and mechanistic insights.

Furthermore, exploring the role of DCP2 in the tumor immune microenvironment and its interactions with immune cells can open new therapeutic strategies, especially in the context of immunotherapy, as suggested by emerging research in Heliyon44. Our approach of combining molecular experiments with immune profiling may provide a more holistic understanding of DCP2’s function and its clinical implications.

In summary, future studies should focus on functional validation, integration of multi-omics and computational analyses, and exploration of immune-related mechanisms to fully exploit the potential of DCP2 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC.
