In physiotherapy for pregnancy-related diastasis recti abdominis, the inter-recti distance (IRD) measurement using ultrasound imaging is typically performed with the patient in supine position. Recently, a standing position, which is considered a functional body position, has been proposed for measurement. However, before adopting standing examination as routine, it is important to study how the linea alba behaves in this position in healthy nulliparas. The main objectives of the study were to compare (1) IRD at two measurement sites between standing and supine positions, and (2) IRD between the two sites within each position. IRD measurements were taken using ultrasound imaging in 27 nulliparas, at the upper edge of the umbilicus (umbilical site) and midway between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid process (umbilical-xiphoid site), in both supine and standing positions. Photographs were taken to monitor participants’ standing posture. At the umbilical-xiphoid site, the mean IRD was greater when standing than when supine (p= 0.004); no significant difference was observed at the umbilical site (p= 0.07). The mean IRD at the umbilicus was greater than at the umbilical-xiphoid site (p= 0.00001). The IRD at the midpoint between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid process changed when assuming the standing position, which was not observed at the superior umbilical border. The IRD was greater in the umbilical region compared to the area further away from the umbilicus cranially. Our findings provide baseline data for future research on symptomatic populations and for establishing normative IRD values in the standing position, which could aid in developing clinical guidelines for assessing diastasis recti abdominis.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging (USI) has been used for diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) screening in physiotherapy, especially concerning parous women. Measurements of inter-recti distance (IRD)/linea alba (LA) width are traditionally performed in the supine position. Normative IRD values in nulliparas in the supine position are up to 15 mm at the xiphoid, 22 mm at 3 cm above the umbilicus, and 16 mm at 2 cm below the umbilicus1. In our recent scoping review on the technical aspects of IRD measurement using USI2, we identified one study which had recommended measuring IRD not only in the supine position, but also in sitting and standing. The authors investigated parous women and obtained greater IRD in upright positions than in the supine position at both the umbilical and supraumbilical levels. They recommended examining women with DRA in these positions, arguing that the supine position is not functional for daily activities. As study limitation they indicated lack of IRD assessment in nulliparas3. Our scoping review also highlighted that assessing LA in vertical positions under conditions of postural abdominal muscle tone and increased load on the anterior abdominal wall may be worthwhile2. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no evidence of the influence of upright posture on IRD in nulliparous women. A study of such populations is vital to establish baseline data regarding normal LA morphology and response to standing position.

Maintaining a standing position requires engagement of both the local and global muscle systems for spinal stability4. Lumbar stabilization is enhanced by increased intra-abdominal pressure5, which results from the activity of the abdominal muscles, primarily the transverse abdominis (TrA) and internal oblique (IO), along with the muscles of the pelvic-lumbar complex [including the pelvic floor muscles (PFM)] and the diaphragm6. The aponeuroses of the external oblique (EO), IO, and TrA muscles form the sheath around the rectus abdominis (RA) and continue to intertwine to form the LA7.

The LA has a complex, layered structure (including the oblique, transverse, and irregular fiber layers) that facilitates force transmission between muscles within the same layer (e.g., EO-to-EO) and across different layers (e.g., EO-to-IO). Along with the RA muscle sheaths, the LA plays a key role in stabilizing the anterior abdominal wall, supporting the abdominal organs, and enabling movements of the thorax and pelvis8. The structural and functional connection between the LA and the abdominal muscles suggests they work together during postural changes and body movements. Electromyography (EMG) signals from the RA muscles are higher in the standing than in the supine position during voluntary contraction of the PFMs in nulliparas. Additionally, the mean normalized activity of the RA and TrA is greater when standing9. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the width of the LA may vary between standing and supine positions in nulliparous women.

According to our scoping review, the IRD is most frequently measured at the superior umbilical border and above the umbilicus, and the measurement reliability is the highest for these measurement sites. These sites are most frequently chosen for IRD measurements also because the supraumbilical DRA patterns are the most common in pregnancy-related DRA. Infraumbilical measurements are more challenging because the posterior rectus sheath is less visible below the umbilicus2. Our reliability study showed that in nulliparous women, the IRD measured at the midpoint between the umbilicus and pubis was very narrow or even non-existent in some cases, with a mean value of 0.14 mm10. To determine measurement sites, the scoping review recommends taking into account inter-individual variability in linea alba length and suggests, for example, selecting a site located halfway between the superior border of the umbilicus and the xiphoid process2.

This cross-sectional study aimed to compare IRD measured with USI at the superior umbilical border (U) and the midpoint between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid process (UX) in nulliparous women between standing and supine positions. The study also sought to determine whether IRD at the UX site differed from that at the U site in either body position. We hypothesized that IRD would be greater in the standing position than in the supine position, and greater at the U site than at the UX site. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether a change in posture affects the location of the chosen measurement site.

Twenty-seven nulliparous women of reproductive age were recruited from among students and employees of our institution. Participants were included in the study following an initial eligibility interview conducted during recruitment.

The inclusion criteria were: good health, age 18–49, Body Mass Index (BMI) < 30, no spinal/hip deformities or disorders, no pain in the preceding 6 months, and no history of abdominal surgery.

Exclusion criteria were: current or previous pregnancy, BMI ≥ 30, history of abdominal surgery, musculoskeletal disorders, professional sports training, and high-intensity resistance abdominal muscle exercises performed regularly two or more times a week. The study participants were given comprehensive information about the study’s purpose and methods and gave written consent to participate, as required by the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed, written consent was obtained from all participants.

Approved by the Institutional Bioethics Committee (Resolution No. 6/2018), the study was conducted between March and May 2022. The entire study was carried out following relevant guidelines and regulations. It was a single-session assessment performed by a single examiner. The session included measuring body mass, height, fat percentage, and BMI using an MBF-6000 body composition scale (Charder Electronic Co., Ltd., Taiwan). Bony landmarks such as the acromion, greater trochanter, and lateral malleolus were identified by palpation and marked to assess standing posture through photographs. Before the examination, participants were asked to empty their bladders and have a bowel movement if necessary.

For measurement site determination, participants lay on the couch with legs parallel, a roll (15 cm in diameter) under their knees, the pelvis in a neutral position, arms at their sides, and the head slightly elevated (15-degree incline of the headrest). Two measurement sites along the LA (umbilical and umbilical-xiphoid) were marked in this position for USI2,10. A line (perpendicular to the abdominal midline) was drawn with a waterproof marker along the superior umbilical border, corresponding to the U point. To identify the other measurement site, the xiphoid process of the sternum was palpated, from which the distance to the U point was measured three times. The mean of the three measurements was used to determine the mid-distance between the U point and the xiphoid, i.e., the UX point. The UX point was marked, and a line perpendicular to the midline was drawn through it. The center of the transducer was positioned precisely at the UX site; its bottom edge was placed at the U site2,10. IRD measurements at U and UX sites in nulliparas demonstrated high intra- and interrater reliability10. The measurement sites marked in the supine position were used to obtain ultrasound images in both the supine and standing positions.

For standing IRD measurements, participants assumed a comfortable, habitual upright position, looking straight ahead at the wall that was 5 m away. All the participants had their upper limbs along their bodies and feet hip-width apart. The anterior-posterior pelvic position was deliberately left unstandardized to measure the LA in each participant’s natural standing posture and abdominal muscle tone. Stick-on marks (38 mm in diameter) were placed on the acromion, greater trochanter, and lateral malleolus bony landmarks, and side photographs were taken with the camera set on a tripod (parallel to the ground) at a distance of 1.9 m from the participant. In each photo, a straight line (‘gravity’ line) passing through the center of the external auditory meatus was drawn towards the ground using the Paint graphics program. We assumed that if the line ran in the area of bony landmarks, there were no substantial postural defects or compensatory mechanisms, and the standing posture was considered undisturbed (qualitative assessment). The LA length from the superior umbilical border to the xiphoid was remeasured three times in the habitual standing position.

A Coin toss was used to randomly select the body position in which the ultrasound images would be taken first. The heads meant that images would be taken in the supine position and then in the standing position. Tails meant the opposite sequence.

Three images of the IRD were taken in each position and at the U and UX sites, totaling 12 images per participant. Images were captured at the end of the subject’s natural expiration when the two medial edges of the RA muscle were visualized. The transducer was removed and reapplied between images10. The examiner employed a minimal pressure technique and visual feedback by monitoring the transducer’s pressure on the tissues to prevent an increase in abdominal muscle tension.

Images were taken using a USI system (LOGIQe; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with an 8–12 MHz, 39-mm linear transducer in B-mode. Focus, depth, and contrast settings were adjusted individually for clarity.

The images were saved as separate files and exported in DICOM format for offline measurements using DICOM viewer software, by the standards for digital transmission and presentation of diagnostic images.

The examiner randomly measured coded images. IRD was defined as the linear distance between the most medial points of the rectus abdominis muscle borders. Mean values of three measurements from each location and condition were used in statistical analyses.

The physiotherapist who performed LA imaging and IRD measurements received a total of six hours of individual training in linea alba imaging (two sessions of 4 and 2 h) from a radiologist with seven years of USI experience. The examiner also completed a 20-hour musculoskeletal USI course for physiotherapists, with two hours focused on measurements of the abdominal wall structures.

Sample size was calculated using GPower (Version 3.1.9.7; Heinrich-Heine Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany). Assuming a type I error of 0.05, power (1–β) of 0.80, and an effect size of 0.5, the required sample size was 27 participants.

The Shapiro-Wilk test checked data normality. Data skewness, kurtosis, and modality were also checked. The Student’s t-test for dependent variables compared means at two measurement sites and in two body positions. Cohen’s d was used as an effect size measure. The effect size was interpreted as small (d = 0.2 – <0.5), medium (d = 0.5 – <0.8), and large (d ≥ 0.8). Statistical significance was set atp≤ 0.05. The data was analyzed using Statistica v.13 (TIBCO Software, Palo Alto, CA, USA).

The first stage of the study included an assessment of the intrarater reliability of off-line IRD measurements. The sample size was determined based on a test for Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), with a type I error of 0.05, target power 1-β of 0.80 (80% power), and three repetitions per subject. The minimum acceptable reliability level was 0.65 (null hypothesis), and the expected reliability level was 0.9 (alternative hypothesis). The calculated minimum sample size for the ICC assessment was 13 participants11. Reliability was based on 156 images (three in the supine and three in standing at two measurement sites). The 3,1 ICC type (two-way mixed effects, absolute agreement, single rater/measurement) was used for intrarater reliability. The following ICC intervals were chosen: a) ≤ 0.5 poor reliability; b) 0.5–0.75 moderate reliability; c) 0.75–0.9 good reliability; d) > 0.9 excellent reliability12. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated using the formula: SEM = SD, where SD was derived from the formula:. The minimal detectable change (MDC95) was calculated as MDC = SEM*1.96*√213.

A total of 324 ultrasound images were obtained from the 27 participating women, on which the IRD measurements were performed. Table1summarises the characteristics of the study participants.

In the supine position, the intrarater ICCs (3,1) were 0.97–0.98, SEM 0.6–0.76 mm, and the MDC95was 1.68–2.11 mm. In standing, the respective values were 0.94–0.96 mm, 0.8–0.91 mm, and 2.21–2.53 mm.

The mean IRD at the UX site was 9.43 mm (SD = 3.15 mm) in the standing position and 8.10 mm (SD = 3.15 mm) in the supine position. It was greater for standing versus supine by 1.33 mm (p= 0.004). No significant differences were found between the two positions at the U site (p= 0.1) (Table2), at which the mean IRD was 14.40 mm (SD = 3.47 mm) in standing and 13.42 mm (SD = 4.05 mm) in supine. Considering individual measurement results, 18 of the 27 nulliparous women (66.7%) showed greater IRD values in the standing position compared to the supine position at both measurement sites, while nine women (33.3%) had smaller IRDs in the standing position. Figure1presents individual differences in IRD values between the standing and supine positions (i.e., standing minus supine) at the U and UX sites, illustrating between-subject variability.

The mean IRD at the U site was greater than at the UX site in both supine (by 5.32 mm;p= 0.00001) and standing positions (by 4.97 mm;p= 0.00001) (Table2). In the supine position, all 27 women (100%) had a greater IRD at the U site than at the UX site. In the standing position, 25 women (92.6%) had a greater IRD at the U site, while two women (7.4%) had a smaller IRD at that site.

The central line represents the mean IRD differences (MD) [mm], and the error bars show the confidence interval (95% CI). Abbreviations: U, superior umbilical border; UX, the midpoint between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid.

The mean distances between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid process were 19.44 ± 2.44 cm (range: 15.47–25.97 cm, 95% confidence interval: 18.47; 20.40 cm) and 19.94 ± 2.20 cm (range: 15.17–25.37 cm, 95% confidence interval: 19.07; 20.82 cm) in the supine and standing positions, respectively. The difference between these values was not statistically significant (p= 0.14).

The study’s main objective was to determine whether the IRD measured using ultrasound imaging (at two sites along LA: superior umbilical border – U, and the midpoint between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid – UX) would be greater in the standing position than in the supine position in healthy nulliparous women of reproductive age. Our results indicated a greater mean IRD at the UX site in the standing position, but no significant differences in mean IRDs at the U site between the supine and standing positions.

The findings suggest that, in nulliparous women, the mean IRD at the UX site was greater in the standing position by a mean of 1.33 mm compared to the supine position. However, there was notable variability in the LA behavior among participants at the U and UX measurement sites. This variability was evidenced by relatively wide standard deviations for the mean IRD and the fact that 33.3% of the women had a smaller IRD in standing.

In women with larger IRDs in the standing position (18/27, 66.7%), the largest individual IRD difference between the two body positions was 7.6 mm at the U site and 5.9 mm at the UX site, while the smallest difference was 0.13 mm (at both sites). In women with greater IRDs in the supine position (9/27, 33.3%), the largest individual difference in IRD values was 5.1 mm at the U site and 2.1 mm at the UX site, and the smallest was 0.33 mm at the U site and 0.03 mm at the UX site. These findings suggest that changes in body position may cause substantial variability in IRD values among healthy nulliparas.

The position of natural standing is associated with greater electromyographic activity of the abdominal muscles than in supine9. The abdominal muscles are more active when standing because of the influence of gravity, the need to maintain posture, and support the abdominal viscera. They also function as accessory respiratory muscles14. The respiratory movements of the thorax and abdomen cause some postural disturbance, which may be adjusted by the lower limb and pelvis movements in quiet standing15. The muscles’ activation occurs during inspiration and expiration; however, in the expiratory phase, the activity of the EO and TrA/IO muscles is greater, for instance, in a standing position than in a sitting position. The respiration-related medial-to-lateral movements of the lower ribcage are also influenced by upright posture16. Therefore, it can be speculated that the difference in the IRD between standing and supine positions observed in our study may be associated with altered abdominal muscle activity in response to the standing position and with the expiratory phase in this position, as the images were taken at the end of expiration.

Furthermore, some evidence on the impact of abdominal exercises on IRD suggests that voluntary TrA muscle activation may increase IRD in nulliparas17–19, which may indicate that the increased IRD observed in the majority of our nulliparas in standing (18/27, 66.7%) may also be related to increased TrA activity in this position9. However, we could not identify the cause of the IRD decrease in the remaining 9/27 women (33.3%) in the standing position; possibly it was related to lower TrA muscle activity in these nine participants. Individual differences in activation levels of abdominal and lumbo-pelvic-hip complex muscles to maintain a standing position may explain the variability. The variability may also be related to different intraabdominal pressure values and breathing patterns, with a predominance of thoracic or diaphragmatic breathing. However, we did not assess these factors. Nuances in body composition, not fully captured by BMI, or differences in habitual standing posture may also lead to inter-individual variability. We intentionally did not standardize participants’ anterior-posterior pelvic position to preserve thair natural stance and prevent possible unnaturally altered abdominal muscle activation and IRD. On the other hand, the lack of direct measurement of muscle activation and respiratory patterns during IRD measurements is a limitation of the present study. Future studies should incorporate these assessments to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

To our knowledge, only one study investigated the impact of body position on IRD; however, it concerned parous women. It reported that the IRD of parous women at the superior umbilical border was 1.8 mm greater in the standing position than in the supine position. The study did not specify whether the IRD was greater in the standing position than in the supine position for each study participant3. The mean IRD of our nulliparous study participants was 0.98 mm greater at the same measurement site, i.e., the superior umbilical border, in the standing position, but this difference was not statistically significant. In as many as 9/27 (33.3%) participants, the IRD was decreased in standing.

The U and UX measurement sites selected for this study are consistent with the recommendations of a scoping review on the technical aspects of ultrasound IRD measurements for physiotherapy purposes2. These two locations have also been utilized in other studies18,19.

Our study demonstrates that in nulliparous women, the mean IRD at the U site was greater than that at the UX site in both the supine and standing positions. The difference between the mean IRDs was 5.32 mm and 4.97 mm in the standing and supine positions, respectively. These results confirm that in healthy, non-obese nulliparas of reproductive age, the width of the LA varies along its course, being wider in the umbilical region than further up from the umbilicus1. This highlights the importance of using standardized measurement sites along the LA for research and clinical practice, as well as considering its normal anatomical structure in pathological and post-treatment size assessments.

In the present study, the mean IRD in the supine position was 13.42 ± 4.05 mm at the U site and 8.10 ± 3.15 mm at the UX site. In a study by Lee and Hodges, the data from 11 nulliparous controls for DRA subjects (assessed in the supine position) showed that their mean IRD at the U site was 0.77 ± 0.34 cm (7.7 ± 3.4 mm), and it was not significantly different from that at the UX site, i.e., 0.61 ± 0.29 cm (6.1 ± 2.9 mm). However, in that study, one of the recruited nulliparas was assigned to the DRA group, which comprised women with IRD greater than 22 mm at 30 mm above the umbilicus or greater than 15 mm inferior to the xiphoid19.

The present study showed that in nulliparas, the LA lengths measured from the superior umbilical border to the xiphoid were similar in both standing and supine. This suggests that the identified measurement sites along the LA (halfway between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid process) did not shift with changes in body position. The practical implication of this finding is that the measurement site determined in the supine position based on anatomical landmarks such as the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid can be used for the IRD examination in standing.

A limitation of the study was the relatively small number of participants over 30 years of age, even though our inclusion criteria targeted women of reproductive age, typically defined as up to 49 years. Within our institution, we were able to recruit only five women over 30. Since age may affect the collagen composition of the linea alba, our findings should be interpreted in relation to women of a similar age group. The study population consisted of healthy, nulliparous (primarily young) women, which limits the generalizability of the results to parous women, those with DRA, or other demographic groups. The findings may also not be generalizable to older nulliparous women or those with a BMI ≥ 30.

Based on our findings, we emphasize the need for future research to clarify why some nulliparous women exhibit lower IRD values in the standing position. Our study limitations include the qualitative nature of the standing posture assessment and the potential for unmeasured postural variations that could be related to differences in abdominal muscle activation and intra-abdominal pressure among individuals. Therefore, quantitative postural analysis may be considered in future research, where feasible. Additionally, the potential influence of the respiratory cycle on IRD, even with measurements taken at end-expiration, should be taken into account. Future studies should consider monitoring abdominal muscle EMG activity and respiratory patterns (thoracic vs. diaphragmatic) during IRD measurements in both standing and supine positions to understand their possible influence. To standardize the standing posture for IRD measurements, it is first necessary to verify whether standardization affects the IRD. Future studies should also examine the relationship between IRD changes in standing and other functional tasks in asymptomatic and symptomatic populations.

Functional LA width assessment may provide additional insights into its behavior under postural abdominal muscle tone and the increased load from abdominal organs. However, before standing position measurements can be recommended for clinical practice, further studies are needed to confirm our findings and verify the LA response to changes in body position in parous women. Establishing normative IRD values in the standing position for nulliparous women is also important. Additionally, comparing abdominal muscle parameters using USI between supine and standing positions in non-DRA and DRA individuals is worthwhile. In the present study, IRD measurements were not taken below the umbilicus due to lower measurement reliability at this site in nulliparous women10. Researchers examining different populations have also reported challenges and lower reliability of ultrasound measurements below the umbilicus3,20,21.

This study shows that, in nulliparas, the mean IRD measured halfway between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid was greater in the standing than in the supine position. No significant differences in mean IRDs were observed between the two body positions at the superior umbilical border. There was notable inter-individual variability in IRD values in response to changes in body position at both measurement sites. Nine (33%) out of 27 participants showed a decrease in IRD when standing. Researchers and clinicians assessing the IRD in parous women in different body positions should be aware that in healthy nulliparous women, some change in the IRD value in standing compared to supine may be a normal phenomenon.

The IRD was greater at the superior umbilical border than at the midpoint between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid in both supine and standing positions. This suggests that the use of standardized IRD measurement sites along the LA course is necessary to ensure measurement repeatability in research and clinical practice.

Similar LA lengths from the superior umbilical border to the xiphoid, obtained in both the supine and standing positions, indicate that measurement sites identified in the supine position (e.g., the midpoint between the superior umbilical border and the xiphoid) can also be applied in the standing position.

This study on standing IRD measurement in nulliparous women provides baseline data for further research in symptomatic populations and for establishing normative IRD values for the standing position, which should precede the introduction of clinical recommendations.
