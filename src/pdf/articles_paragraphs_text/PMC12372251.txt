The widespread distribution of air pollutants poses a major challenge to global public health, causing a range of health problems, including the incidence and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aims to provide insights into the specific effects of air pollutants on the risk of IPF through a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis approach.

The present study was conducted through a comprehensive search of four data—Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library—from their inception to 25th November 2024, limited to English-language literature. To assess the potential relationship between a wide range of air pollutants and IPF, a random effects model was used to estimate the risk factors in this study. In addition, subgroup analyses of the data according to age, sex, smoking habits, and geographic location were performed, with the aim of exploring the relationship between air pollutants and the risk of IPF in different populations.

A total of 17 papers covering 14 countries were included in this study, totaling 18 studies involving 858,557 participants and 25,968 event occurrences. Our systematic evaluation and meta-analysis showed an increased risk of IPF disease progression for every 5 µg/m3increase in PM2.5(RR = 1.08, 95% CI:1.01,1.15; I2= 63.51%;p= 0.01; 7 studies). The risk of IPF progression was increased for every 10 µg/m3increase in NO2( RR = 1.32,95% CI:1.16,1.50; I2= 38.59%;p= 0.12; 7 studies). For every 10 µg/m3increase in O3, there was an increased risk of IPF progression (RR = 1.19, 95% CI:1.03,1.38; I2= 29.05%;p= 0.24; 4 studies). For every 10 µg/m3increase in CO increase of 10 µg/m3was associated with an increased risk of IPF progression (RR = 1.28, 95% CI:1.01,1.63; I2= 20.03%;p= 0.29; 3 studies). For every 10 µg/m3increase in NOX, the risk of IPF progression was increased (RR = 1.21, 95% CI:1.11, 1.33; I2= 13.69%;p= 0.31; 3 studies). For every 10 µg/m3increase in NO2, there was an increased risk of IPF incidence (RR = 1.67, 95% CI:1.05,2.66; I2= 36.94%;p= 0.20; 3 studies).

This study found that NO2and PM2.5increase the risk of IPF disease progression, while NOX, CO, and O3also increase this risk, albeit with limited data. In addition, NO2increases the risk of IPF occurrence. Therefore, global health policies targeting reductions in air pollutants like NO2and PM2.5may reduce the risk of the occurrence and progression of IPF, with significant implications for the future prevention and treatment of IPF.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, fibrotic, fatal interstitial lung disease of unknown cause, characterized by dyspnoea and progressive deterioration of lung function [1]. In recent years, the incidence of IPF has been increasing, particularly among the elderly, affecting approximately 3 million people worldwide and significantly impacting global public health [2]. The prognosis of IPF is poor and survival is short, with the median survival of IPF patients in the United States aged 65 and older being only 3.8 years [3]. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of IPF, treatment outcomes remain limited. Of the available treatment options, lung transplantation is indicated for only a minority of patients, while the majority of patients rely primarily on antifibrotic therapy and supportive and palliative measures [4,5]. However, current interventions to delay or prevent the development of IPF are quite limited. The pathogenesis of IPF has not been fully elucidated, but evidence suggests that air pollution is strongly associated with its development [6–8]. However, the specific relationship between air pollution and IPF incidence, progression, and mortality remains unclear. Therefore, it has become increasingly urgent to study the effects of air pollution on the development and progression of IPF disease.

Air pollution is one of the key environmental concerns globally [9]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) listed air pollution as one of the major threats to human health in 2019 [10]. Inhaled air pollutants mainly include PM10, PM2.5, ultrafine particles (UFPs), NO2, O3, CO, and SO2[11]. With the rapid development of global industrialization and urbanization, air pollutants are generated through industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and forest fires, and enter the human body to induce disease. According to the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM), about 9 million people worldwide die from air pollution every year [12]. Studies have shown that genetic, occupational exposure, and environmental factors have a significant impact on the development of IPF [6,7]. Long-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of the development and progression of IPF [13]. There is an association between PM2.5and the progression of IPF disease, which can further deteriorate lung function and increase mortality in patients [14]. Patients with IPF have an increased risk of developing lung cancer when they are exposed to high concentrations of NO2(≥ 21. 0 ppb) [15]. Air pollutants, such as PM2.5[14]、NO2[15], and UFPs [16], are considered risk factors associated with the risk of IPF. Therefore, these controllable airborne risk factors are potential targets for intervention to delay or prevent IPF.

Although existing studies have confirmed that air pollutants may be involved in the onset, clinical progression, and adverse prognosis of IPF, there is a lack of research on the relationship between exposure levels of specific pollutants and the risk of IPF onset, progression, and mortality. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of existing studies on the association between air pollutants and IPF, aiming to identify potential associations between air pollutant exposure and the risk of IPF onset, progression, and mortality, to provide appropriate information and evidence for future clinicians when discussing the risk of IPF with their patients.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies exploring the association between air pollutants and the risk of IPF in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Evaluation and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria [17]. This study protocol was registered with the Prospective Registry of International Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 25 November 2024 for our evaluation protocol, registration number CRD42024619049.

In the systematic evaluation and meta-analysis, we relied on the PECO-S framework to include eligible studies: (1) general population (excluding those with serious diseases, such as cancer, immune system disorders, etc.; age > 18 years; gender and ethnicity were not restricted); (2) exposures to ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NOX, O3, CO, and SO2); (3) objective measurements of air pollutant concentrations; (4) IPF-related outcomes (incidence, progression (IPF progression was uniformly defined as meeting ≥ 1 of the following criteria: (1) based on criteria of decreased lung function (FVC and DLco); (2) Criteria based on imaging deterioration; (3) Criteria based on clinical outcomes (acute respiratory failure, etc.)), and mortality); and 5) observational studies (cohort and case-control, etc.).

We excluded studies with the following conditions: (1) special populations (e.g., non-adult and occupational exposure-related participants); (2) no exposure to ambient air pollutants; (3) no effect on IPF-related outcomes; (4) studies for which the full text or data were unavailable; and (5) conference abstracts, letters, reviews, animal experiments, clinical trials, case reports, or reviews (conference abstract, letter, animal experiment, clinical trial research study, case report, or review).

Based on the above criteria, evaluators CL and YYH performed an initial screening of the titles and abstracts of the retrieved literature to include eligible studies. Literature that was not excluded was independently assessed by two other evaluators, JT and BN, by reading the full text. If disagreements arose during the literature screening process, a fifth evaluator, SZ, adjudicated until a consensus was reached.

Evaluators CL and YYH used standardized forms to extract relevant data from the eligible studies, respectively, which mainly included the following information: (1) basic information about the study (including the first author, year of publication, study period, and source of data); (2) details of the study design (including the study location, the number of subjects, the mean age, the proportion of females, the proportion of smokers, BMI, and the type of study design); (3) air pollution exposure details (including types of pollutants and their mean concentrations); (4) outcome definitions (onset, progression, and death from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causing effects) and adjusted maximum risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs); and (5) covariates (including age, sex, smoking status, and geographic location). In case of unclear information or missing data in an article, the corresponding author of the manuscript will be contacted to resolve the issue. If multiple publications from the same cohort exist, the study will give preference to the study with the most comprehensive and up-to-date information. Subsequently, evaluator XW will conduct quality control of the entire data extraction process; in case of disagreement, evaluator SZ will be involved in the discussion and resolution.

Where MW represents each air pollutant, and T represents the actual ambient temperature.

We used the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model [20] to analyze the pooled risk ratios and assess the relationship between exposure to air pollutants and the risk of IPF onset, progression, and mortality. Pooled results were expressed as RRs and their 95% CIs for the risk of IPF onset, progression, and mortality for each 10 µg/m3increase in air concentrations of O3, PM10, NO2, and NOX, for each 5 µg/m3increase in PM2.5concentration and for each 1 mg/m3increase in CO concentration. If studies assessed associations of two or more outcomes, these were all included in the analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran’s Q test, expressed as an I2statistic, and categorized as significant and non-significant. If heterogeneity was significant (I2≤ 50%), a fixed-effects model was used; if heterogeneity was high (I2> 50%), a random-effects model was used. We performed subgroup analyses based on predetermined study characteristics, such as geographic location, proportion of females, mean age, and proportion of smokers, to explore factors that significantly influenced the heterogeneity of the results of the main analyses. In addition, we performed ‘leave-one-out’ sensitivity analyses to test for the effect of each study on the overall effect by excluding it when the total number of studies was greater than 10. Potential publication bias was analyzed by funnel plots and Egger’s test; if significant bias was found, adjustments were made by the trim-and-fill method. Two-tailed P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

This meta-analysis assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which is applicable to both cohort and case-control studies [21]. The NOS consists of eight items on three dimensions (selection, comparability, and outcome), which are rated on a scale of up to 9 points out of a maximum of 1 for each item. If the item design was controlled for confounders, the score was out of 2. Studies were categorized into low quality (0–3), moderate quality (4–6), and high quality (7–9) based on the score.

We used Stata software (version 16, 2019, StataCorp LP, TX, USA) for meta-analyses. Statistical tests were two-tailed, andp< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

After the systematic search, we obtained a total of 1254 literatures. After excluding 129 duplicates, we excluded 1051 documents based on title and abstract screening. Subsequently, 74 literatures were screened in full text and finally, 17 literatures met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic evaluation (Fig.1).

Of the 17 publications, 1 contained 2 studies from different periods [22]. The 18 studies were from 7 in Europe [8,23–28], 5 in Asia [22,29–31], 4 in North American states [32–35], 1 in Australia [36], and 1 in a South American state [37], details of which are shown in Table1. Of these, 17 were cohort studies and 1 was a case-control Study. The studies primarily assessed the effects of a wide range of air pollutants on IPF, including the occurrence (n= 4), progression (n= 10), and death (n= 5) of IPF. A total of 858,557 participants were involved in this study, with 25,968 events occurring. The mean age range of participants was 41.8 to 73.7 years. Air pollutant ranges from 460.4 to 960 ppb for CO, 40.0 to 125.44 µg/m3for O3, 12.60 to 80.84 µg/m3for NO2, 43.99 to 50.49 µg/m3for NOX, 6.8 to 88.9 µg/m3for PM2.5, and 16.23 to 67 µg/m3for PM10. SO2was 2.53 ~ 9 ppb. Among the 18 included studies, 14 were rated as high quality, while 4 were rated as moderate quality. For detailed information, please refer to the supplementary materials.

Pooling the data from all included studies, our meta-analysis showed that CO, NO2, NOX, O3, and PM2.5air pollutants were significantly and positively associated with the risk of IPF disease progression, respectively (Fig.2; Table2). However, there was no significant association between SO2and PM10and the risk of IPF disease progression. We observed a significant association between ambient NO2and the risk of IPF disease progression. Specifically, a 10 µg/m3increase in ambient NO2is associated with a 1.32 (1.16, 1.50) point change in the progress of IPF (Fig.2; Table2). Of the eight included studies, six showed a positive association between NO2and the risk of IPF disease progression [24–26,29,35,37]. Studies by Qiang Zheng [36] and Lucile Sesé [8] showed no significant positive correlation between ambient NO2and the progression of IPF disease.

NOXis significantly associated with the risk of disease progression in IPF. Specifically, a 10 µg/m3increase in ambient NOXis associated with a 1.21 (1.11, 1.33) point change in the progress of IPF (Fig.2; Table2). NOXwas positively associated with the risk of disease progression in IPF in all three included studies [24,25,37].

O3is significantly associated with the risk of disease progression in IPF. Specifically, a 10 µg/m3 increase in ambient O3is associated with a 1.19 (1.03, 1.38) point change in the progress of IPF (Fig.2; Table2). Of the four included studies, two showed a positive association between O3and the risk of disease progression of IPF [32,37]. The study by Na’ama Avitzur [32] showed no significant negative association between O3and the risk of disease progression of IPF. The study by Kerri A Johannson [35] showed no significant positive association between O3and the risk of disease progression of IPF. Significant positive correlation.

CO is significantly associated with the risk of disease progression in IPF. Specifically, a 1 mg/m3 increase in ambient CO is associated with a 1.28 (1.01, 1.63) point change in progress of IPF (Fig.2; Table2). Of the three included studies, only one showed a positive association between CO and the risk of IPF disease progression [24]. Studies by Kerri A Johannson [35] and Pablo Mariscal-Aguilar [37] showed no significant positive association between CO and the risk of IPF disease progression.

PM2.5is significantly associated with the risk of disease progression in IPF. Specifically, a 5 µg/m3increase in ambient PM2.5is associated with a 1.08 (1.01, 1.15) point change in the progress of IPF (p= 0.01) (Fig.2; Table2). Of the six included studies, three showed that PM2.5was positively associated with the risk of IPF disease progression [22,25,26]. studies by Qiang Zheng [36] and Lucile Sesé [8] showed that PM2.5was not significantly positively associated with IPF disease progression. a study by Na’ama Avitzur [32] showed that PM2.5was not significantly negatively associated with the risk of IPF disease progression was not significantly negatively correlated.

The results of our meta-analysis showed that NO2and PM10air pollutants were significantly and positively associated with the risk of incidence of IPF, respectively (Fig.3; Table3). However, CO, O3, PM2.5,and SO2were not significantly associated with the risk of incidence of IPF; NO and NOXwere not included in the analysis due to insufficient literature. We observed a significant association between ambient NO2and the risk of incidence of IPF. Specifically, a 10 µg/m3increase in ambient NO2is associated with a 1.37 (1.05, 2.66) point change in the incidence of IPF (Fig.3; Table3). Of the three included studies, two showed a positive association between NO2and the risk of incidence of IPF [28,33]. A study by Masahiro Tahara [30] reported no significant positive association between NO2and IPF onset.

PM10was significantly associated with the risk of IPF onset. Specifically, a 10 µg/m3increase in ambient PM10is associated with a 1.29 (1.11, 1.50) point change in incidence of IPF (Fig.3; Table3). Of the 2 included studies, only 1 reported that PM10was positively associated with the risk of IPF onset [33]. A study by Masahiro Tahara [30] showed that PM10was not significantly associated with the risk of IPF onset.

Our meta-analysis showed no significant association between CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10,and SO2air pollutants and the risk of death from IPF disease (Fig.4).

Table4mainly shows the results of the subgroup meta-analysis of NO2, PM2.5,and O3in relation to the risk of IPF disease progression. When analyzing the association of NO2and PM2.5with the risk of IPF disease progression, we grouped them according to age (> 70 and ≤ 70), and the results showed that the RR values of the two groups were 1.41 (95% CI: 1.09,1.50; I2= 56.65%) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.09,1.47; I2= 26.23%), both of which were statistically significance, with lower heterogeneity in the ≤ 70 years group. This suggests that the RR values for NO2and risk of disease progression in IPF were comparable in both age groups. In the regional analysis of NO2, only the European region had statistically significant RR values (RR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10,1.53; I2= 28.14%) with a low level of heterogeneity. Gender analysis showed that the proportion of females was < 50% in all cases, and males were significantly associated with the risk of progression of NO2and IPF (RR = 1.32; 95%CI: 1.16,1.50; I2= 38.58%). The RR values for smoking ≥ 50% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI:1.04,1.42; I2= 36.63%) and < 50% (RR = 1.49; 95%CI:1.22,1.81; I2= 22.66%) were statistically significant and less heterogeneous in the former.

In the association analysis between PM2.5and the risk of disease progression in IPF, the RR value (RR = 1.15; 95%CI: 0.69,1.82; I2= 78.52%) was not statistically significant for those aged > 70, whereas the RR value (RR = 1.38; 95%CI: 1.12,1.70; I2= 0.00%) was statistically significant for those ≤ 70. No statistically significant RR values were found for smoking percentages ≥ 50% and < 50%, although heterogeneity was lower in the former (I2= 48.17%). The RR values were not statistically significant in any of the regions except for the European region (RR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.15,1.94; I2= 11.34%) and the Asian region (RR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.03,1.07; I2= 0.00%) where the RR values of the studies were statistically significantly associated. In addition, in the gender analysis, there was no statistically significant association between the RR values of studies with < 50% females.

In the analysis of the association between O3and the risk of disease progression in IPF, the RR value (RR = 1.14; 95%CI:1.00,1.30; I2= 0.00%) was statistically significant in the age > 70 population, whereas it was not statistically significant for ≤ 70. In the analysis of gender, the RR value for the proportion of women < 50% for O3(RR = 1.19; 95%CI: 1.03,1.38; I2= 29.05%) was statistically significant. The RR value (RR = 1.14; 95%CI:1.00,1.30; I2= 0.00%) for the proportion of smokers < 50% was statistically significant.

In addition, in the gender analysis, the RR value for the association of the risk of disease progression in IPF with CO was RR = 1.47; 95%CI:1.08,1.99; I2= 54.41% for the proportion of females < 50%, and RR = 1.21; 95%CI:1.11,1.33; I2= 13.68% for the association with NOX, both of which were statistically significant (Fig.5A). In the association analysis between NOXand the risk of disease progression in IPF, the RR value for the proportion of smoking < 50% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI:1.11,1.33; I2= 13.68%) was statistically significant (Fig.5B).

We performed publication bias and sensitivity analyses mainly on the relationship between NO2and PM2.5and the risk of progression in IPF (Fig.6). The funnel plot and Egger’s test revealed that there was publication bias for NO2(P= 0.033 < 0.05), which was statistically significant, whereas there was no publication bias for PM2.5(P= 0.275 > 0.05), which was not statistically significant, and the trim-and-fill method did not change the results. The sensitivity analyses did not show contradictory results compared to the main analyses, suggesting that the analyses were robust.

This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between air pollution and IPF onset, progression, and mortality. We analyzed 17 papers (14 countries, 858,557 participants, 25,968 events) and found consistent evidence linking higher air pollutant levels with IPF risk. PM2.5and NO2were significantly associated with IPF incidence, while CO, NOX, and O3showed ties to progression. In the development of IPF, we only found a significant positive correlation between NO2and IPF incidence. Although PM10also showed a correlation, the literature is limited. Notably, NO2was a risk factor for IPF progression in men, possibly due to higher smoking rates, which exacerbate inflammation and fibrosis. Smoking itself showed a dose-dependent relationship with IPF risk [38,39], supported by Mendelian randomization evidence [40]. NO2is a risk factor for IPF disease progression in the European region, possibly related to higher NO2concentrations in Europe [41,42]. This is consistent with Johnson et al. [35] who reported that acute exacerbation of IPF may be associated with increased NO2concentration. In recent years, with increasing air pollution, a study by Yang et al. [43] found that IPF is mainly caused by the senes/cence of alveolar type 2 cells and that PM2.5can lead to lung injury and fibrosis by inducing cellular senescence. It has also been found that airborne PM2.5particulate matter can induce senescence of alveolar epithelial cells and lung tissues and exacerbate disease progression by promoting inflammatory responses and DNA damage [44]. Our study showed that PM2.5was an unfavorable factor for IPF disease progression in people aged ≤ 70 years. Therefore, we hypothesize that the main reason is that PM2.5is more likely to induce alveolar type 2 epithelial cell senescence in young and old people and damage DNA to promote IPF progression. Further experimental validation is needed.

From the above studies, we found that the current research on the effects of NO2and PM2.5on IPF is the most focused. However, whether the association between NO2and PM2.5and IPF indicates a causal relationship, and the specific mechanisms by which they contribute to the occurrence, progression, and death of IPF, respectively, have not yet been fully clarified. IPF is known to be a chronic, progressive and irreversible interstitial lung disease with a complex pathogenesis involving genetic susceptibility, environmental exposure and abnormal repair response. In recent years, air pollutants such as NO2and PM2.5have been identified as significant environmental risk factors for IPF. NO2and PM2.5exacerbate IPF through inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, telomere dysfunction, and DNA damage [45,46]. As lungs are its direct target, PM2.5penetrates alveoli and enters circulation, carrying adsorbed toxins (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, dioxins) [47,48]. These compounds cause oxidative stress by damaging antioxidant defense, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [49]; induce mitochondrial/DNA damage and promote autophagy/apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and triggering oxidative stress [50,51]; activate the fibrotic pathway through the release of inflammatory cytokines [49]. NO2inhibits telomerase, accelerates alveolar epithelial aging, and mirrors the telomere shortening seen in IPF and pollution-exposed lungs [52]. High NO2exposure increases mortality from chronic bronchitis, COPD, asthma, lung cancer, and IPF [15,53–55] by generating lipid peroxides that injure airway epithelium, trigger compensatory proliferation and inflammation, and drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, leading to fibrotic tissue replacement [56]. The above experimental evidence suggests that long-term exposure to NO2and PM2.5can break through the physiological barrier of the respiratory tract and settle in the terminal bronchiolar and alveolar regions. This deposition process triggers a local inflammatory cascade, promoting the production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn causes oxidative damage and DNA damage to type II alveolar epithelial cells. The continuous cell damage and abnormal repair eventually lead to the remodeling of lung tissue structure, forming the characteristic pathological changes of fibrosis. This is consistent with the results of this study, which showed that for every 5 µg/m3increase in PM2.5exposure, or 10 µg/m3increase in NO2, the risk of disease progression in IPF increased correspondingly. The cohort study by Cui et al. [25]. also confirmed that long-term exposure to PM2.5pollution was significantly positively correlated with the risk of IPF. This suggests that long-term exposure to PM2.5and NO2can lead to oxidative stress and DNA damage, promoting the occurrence and progression of IPF. However, Further studies from basic medicine to clinical medicine level are needed to thoroughly understand the mechanism of action of NO2, PM2.5,and other air pollutants on the occurrence and development of IPF.

A previous meta-analysis, mainly Harari et al. [6] assessing the effects of air pollutants on fibrotic interstitial lung disease, did not provide risk ratios for relevant findings. In contrast to the Harari et al. study, the present study specifically collected and categorized studies on the effects of multiple air pollutants on IPF outcomes, including the onset, progression, and mortality of IPF, and included air pollutants such as NOXand SO2in the exposure-based analysis. As the studies included by Harari et al. were older, relevant new studies from recent years were included in this study for updating. These processes increased the rigor and comprehensiveness of this study and helped to improve the quality of the study.

Notably, our study also applied subgroup analyses to explore the heterogeneity among the included studies, such as a statistically significant higher risk of exacerbation in male IPF patients compared to females under the influence of PM2.5, NO2, CO, and NOX. For O3, the results were reversed. It is unclear whether men are more sensitive to air pollution than women. However, studies by Bell [57] and Kim [58] showed that females were more susceptible to air pollutants than males. Although the study by Harari et al. provided preliminary evidence for the association of air pollutants with the risk of IPF, the present study accurately differentiated between exposures to each air pollutant by implementing stricter inclusion and exclusion criteria and included more new studies from recent years.

This study is the first meta-analysis of the association between multiple air pollutants and the risk of IPF incidence, progression, and mortality. First, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic search in four databases. Second, we conducted a rigorous and systematic quality assessment of the included studies. We included a total of 18 studies, including 17 cohort studies, with high-quality assessment of the literature, risk of bias assessment, and sensitivity analyses to ensure data credibility and robustness of the results. We conducted subgroup analyses by age, sex, smoking, and geographic location to explore whether associations varied by these clinical characteristics.

This study has several limitations. First, most included studies lacked detailed air pollutant concentration data, preventing dose-response analysis. While observational data suggest associations between pollutants and IPF risk, causal relationships remain unproven—future Mendelian randomization studies could clarify this. Additionally, exposure settings (indoor or outdoor) were rarely specified, though pollutant profiles differ significantly between these environments. Second, socioeconomic factors (income, education), occupational exposures (dust), and comorbidities (COPD, cardiovascular disease) may modify pollutant effects, but standardized reporting of these confounders was absent. We urge future studies to: (1) assess how socioeconomic stratification influences pollution-disease associations; (2) evaluate occupational protections for high-risk groups; and (3) define comorbidity-driven toxicity thresholds. Furthermore, limited study numbers in subgroup analyses reduced robustness against publication bias. The included studies applied heterogeneous diagnostic criteria for defining IPF disease progression. This variability in definitions may introduce heterogeneity in effect sizes, thereby compromising the stability of pooled estimates. Although we attempted to mitigate such variation through subgroup analyses and random-effects models, the results should be interpreted with caution when combining data. Future studies must standardize the definition of disease progression to enhance the generalizability of meta-analysis conclusions. Finally, single-pollutant models may not be able to assess interactions between air pollutants, and future studies should use hybrid models. Notably, no significant link emerged between pollutants and IPF mortality, possibly due to advanced IPF are older, have largely lost their lung function, and are less sensitive to air pollutants; insufficient sample sizes may also have led to meaningless results. Therefore, larger, standardized studies are warranted.

Our findings suggest that high NO2and PM2.5exposures increase the risk of IPF progression, with associations with NOX, CO, and O3as well, but there is limited data in the literature. In particular, high NO2concentrations also increased the risk of IPF development. Therefore, reducing the concentration of air pollutants such as NO2and PM2.5is potentially relevant for the prevention and treatment of IPF, especially in women and non-smokers with a significant protective effect. Overall, our findings strengthen the evidence for air pollutants as risk factors for IPF and provide a reference for clinicians and health policymakers to develop measures or actions to ameliorate global environmental problems and reduce the risk of IPF.
