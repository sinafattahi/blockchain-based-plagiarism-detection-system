Hypertension is one of the prominent modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and its prevalence is continuously increasing each year, contributing significantly to mortality and disability in older adults in China and even worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of declined intrinsic capacity (IC) on the risk of 1-year functional disability in older hypertensive inpatients.

A total of 233 hypertensive elderly from Zhejiang Hospital in China were included in this retrospective observational study. Five domains of IC including cognition, locomotion, vitality, psychology, and sensory capacity were assessed at admission. Functional disability was defined as new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) over a 1-year follow-up period. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationships between IC domains at baseline and 1-year functional disability.

The incidence of decline in five domains of IC, including cognition, locomotion, vitality, psychology, sensory (vision and hearing status) capacity were 28.8%, 55.8%, 27.9%, 12.4%, 42.9% and 63.1% respectively. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) were negatively linked to the IC composite score, and specifically with two domains of IC, including cognition and locomotion (P< 0.05). During the 1-year follow-up, 50 participants (21.5%) experienced functional disability. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher IC composite score on admission was associated with a lower one-year risk of functional disability (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40–0.80,P= 0.001); cognitive decline and locomotion impairment predicted 1-year functional disability in older hypertensive inpatients (OR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.41–6.69,P= 0.005; OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 1.30–8.63,P= 0.012).

Declined cognition and locomotion increased the risk of functional disability 1 year after discharge, early prevention and management of declined intrinsic capacity is critically important among hypertensive elderly.

Chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs), particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD), have emerged as a significant global epidemic, posing a substantial public health challenge among older adults. CVD is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a report on the Cardiovascular Health and Diseases in 2022 highlighting that CVD accounted for a significant proportion of deaths (48.00% in rural areas and 45.86% in urban areas) in China alone [1]. Hypertension, a prominent modifiable risk factor for CVD, continues to rise in prevalence and significantly contributes to mortality and disability, both in China and worldwide [2–4].

Hypertensive patients, especially older adults, often present with complex clinical profiles including elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), substantial blood pressure fluctuations, polypharmacy, and pseudo-hypertension [5–7]. Advancing age increases vulnerability to adverse effects of anti-hypertensive medications, particularly hypotension-related complications like falls, syncope, and fractures [8–10]. Consequently, hypertension guidelines emphasize the importance of considering the overall functional status, including frailty and cognitive function, when setting treatment goals for older adults prior to initiating anti-hypertensive medication [11–13]. This focus on functional status aligns closely with the concept of the World Health Organization's concept of intrinsic capacity (IC), a core element of healthy aging proposed in 2015 [14]. IC represents the sum of an individual's physical and mental capacities, which encompass cognitive function, psychological well-being, vitality, locomotion, and sensory abilities [14]. Importantly, a decline in IC is associated with several adverse health outcomes in older adults, including falls [15], frailty [16], disability [17,18], hospital admissions [19,20], and mortality [20,21].

Given that hypertension can influence multiple functional domains, accumulating evidence has established links between blood pressure, its treatment, prognosis, and impairments across various IC dimensions. Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) revealed that untreated or uncontrolled hypertension is associated with worsened cognitive trajectories [22]. Depression frequently co-occurs with hypertension and may itself contribute to cardiovascular disease progression [23]. Hypertension adversely affects physical function, accelerating gait slowing in older adults; slow gait itself predicts poor prognosis in hypertensive patients [24,25]. Sensory impairments, such as declines in hearing and vision, indicate hypertension-induced target organ damage [26]. Malnutrition, assessed using the Geriatric Nutrition Risk Index, predicts the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in older adults with hypertension [27]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis reveals that hypertension is a significant risk factor for IC decline in community elderly, affecting over two-thirds of community-dwelling older adults [28].

While available studies demonstrate that hypertension contributes to impairments in individual IC domains and predicts overall IC decline, they differ in methodologies and rarely examine the complex, multidirectional relationships between these domains. In addition, despite the established link between IC decline and disability [17,18], and the known role of hypertension as a risk factor for both [28], there is a critical gap in understanding whether and how decline in overall IC and its specific domains influences the onset of functional disability specifically in older adults with hypertension [29].

Therefore, this study aims to examine the prevalence of declined IC and analyze its association with the onset of functional disability after one year in older adults with hypertension.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Zhejiang Hospital in China from October 2014 to July 2019. A total of 515 potential elderly inpatients were recruited and eventually 233 participants used for analysis in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 60 years, diagnosis of hypertension according to the Chinese Guidelines for Management of Hypertension, ability to walk independently or with walking aids, and ability to comprehend and communicate effectively. The exclusion criteria included non-hypertensive patients, acute medical conditions (e.g., acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, acute infection), activities of daily living (ADL) scores below 60 on the Bath index [30], and lack of follow-up data.

This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Hospital (2013–25).

Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, and alcohol history were collected at baseline. More than or equal to 5 chronic diseases in an individual was defined as comorbidities [31]. Polypharmacy was considered as concomitant use of at least 5 oral medications daily [32,33]. Hypertension duration, signifying cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure, provides incremental prognostic value beyond current blood pressure measurements [34]. In this study, hypertension duration was categorized into clinically convenient groups (≤ 9, 10–19, and ≥ 20 years) to ensure sufficient functional disability incidences within each category. Hypertension stage was classified according to the 2018 Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension [35] (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3). Additionally, blood pressure control status, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP) were recorded.

In this study, five domains of IC were selected, including cognition, locomotion, vitality, psychology and sensory capacity. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was utilized to evaluate cognitive function [36]. A cut-off score of ≤ 24 was established to indicate cognitive decline. Locomotion was assessed through a four-meter gait speed test in which participants were instructed to walk twice their usual distance starting from a stationary position (walking aids or canes allowed). The recorded time for the shorter attempt was noted. The cut-off value for gait speed was established as < 1.0m/s, in accordance with the recommendations provided by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) [37]. Vitality was measured using the short-form Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF) [38], with scores ranging from 0 to 14 and a score ≤ 11 indicating risk of malnutrition. Psychological capacity was evaluated by assessing depressive symptoms through the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) [39], with a cut-off GDS-15 score ≥ 6 indicating poorer psychological performance. Self-reported vision and hearing status was used to ascertain sensory capacity, which was categorized as normal and impairment. Intrinsic capacity (IC) assessments were conducted by certified geriatric assessors. Qualified team members performed all evaluations following completion of a standardized training protocol. This protocol ensured consistent administration through detailed review of scoring criteria, supervised practice exercises, and formal qualification assessments.

Any decline in each IC domain was recorded as 0, otherwise it was recorded as [40]. The IC composite total score was calculated as the sum of the number of normal domains, with a range of 0 to 5 in this study. A higher IC composite score was indicative of a higher reserved functional capacity.

Functional disability was defined as the emergence of new dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL) using the Bath index over a 1-year follow-up period. ADL performance was assessed by scoring each item according to the level of independence demonstrated by older adults. New ADL dependency was operationally defined as a decline of at least five points in the total ADL score one-year post-discharge among hospitalized elderly patients.

Data collection was performed by trained investigators using standardized protocols. To minimize bias, the investigator conducting the follow-up assessments was blinded to baseline data, follow-up was completed via structured telephone conversations or face-to-face interviews.

Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The proportion of missing data was below 10%, suggesting minimal impact on analytical validity and potential bias; consequently, incomplete cases were excluded from subsequent analyses. Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), non-normally distributed continuous variables as median and interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. Group comparisons of baseline characteristics and IC domains employed Student's t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables, chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact tests where appropriate) for categorical variables, and Mann–Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Variance inflation factors (VIF < 5) indicated no significant multicollinearity. Additionally, multivariable logistic regression models examined associations between baseline IC domains and one-year functional disability. Covariates were selected based on established confounding factors from literature and variables demonstrating significant associations (P< 0.05) in bivariate analyses. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was defined asP< 0.05.

Our analysis included a total of 233 elderly hypertensive inpatients, the procedure of patient selection is detailed in Fig.1. As shown in Fig.2, the incidence of IC deficits in our study, including cognitive decline, locomotion impairment, malnutrition risk, depression, hearing and vision impairment, were 28.8%, 55.8%, 27.9%, 12.4%, 42.9% and 63.1% respectively. Notably, the incidence of cognitive decline, locomotion impairment, malnutrition risk, hearing impairment, and vision impairment demonstrated an age-dependent increase. In contrast, depressive symptoms showed no significant age-related increase in this hypertensive elderly population (Fig.3).

As detailed in Table1, 50 elderly hypertensive inpatients (21.5%) experienced functional disability within 1 year of follow-up. Compared to patients who remained functionally independent, those developing new-onset functional disability were significantly older, had a lower proportion of married individuals, and exhibited higher percentages of comorbidities, polypharmacy, cognitive decline, locomotion impairment, malnutrition, alongside a lower IC composite score (allP< 0.05).

The comparison of hypertensive-related characteristics in this study revealed the median SBP was 140mmHg in participants with functional disability, higher than in those who maintained their function (134mmHg) (P< 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between the groups regarding hypertension duration, hypertension stage, prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension, DBP and PP between two groups (Table2).

Both SBP and PP demonstrated significant inverse associations with the IC composite score. Specifically, these parameters were negatively associated with the cognition and locomotion IC domains (allP< 0.05). In contrast, DBP showed a significant positive association with the locomotion domain (P< 0.05) (Table3).

The logistic regression analysis showed that cognitive decline and locomotion impairment were independently associated with significantly increased risk of functional disability (OR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.41–6.69,P= 0.005; OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 1.30–8.63,P= 0.012) in older hypertensive inpatients after 1-year follow-up when adjusted the possible confounders. Furthermore, a higher IC composite score at admission was associated with a lower one-year risk of functional disability (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40–0.80,P= 0.001) (Table4).

This study demonstrates that both SBP and PP negatively correlate with IC in elderly hypertensive inpatients, particularly impairing cognition and locomotion domains. Crucially, a higher IC composite score at admission predicted a reduced risk of functional disability within one year.

Locomotion impairment emerged as a predominant issue in this population, affecting 55.8% of elderly hypertensive inpatients. This prevalence aligns with findings by Zhu et al. in hospitalized older adults [40], but exceeds rates in community-based cohorts [41,42], underscoring the heightened vulnerability within the hospitalized setting. Hospitalization is a major trigger for long-term disability in older adults [43–45], with new-onset disability incidence ranging widely from 5 to 50% and being strongly associated with increased adverse outcomes [46–50]. Locomotion capacity, particularly gait speed, serves as a key indicator of systemic vascular health and physical resilience in older adults [51]. In our cohort, compared with older patients exhibiting a normal gait, those with a slow gait speed had a 2.35-fold increased risk of functional disability. This is consistent with its established role as a quantifiable predictor of long-term functional disability, loss of independence, and survival [52–54]. Notably, hypertension-induced cerebral microangiopathy (e.g., white matter lesions, WMLs) may concurrently compromise locomotion and cognition, WMLs in specific brain regions directly correlating with slow gait speed, thereby synergistically amplifying functional disability risk [55–57].

Functional disability is critically linked to hypertension-mediated vascular pathophysiology. Elevated blood pressure accelerates arterial stiffness, impairing cerebral perfusion and disrupting motor control circuits [58–62], which significantly contributes to the association between slow gait speed and ADL limitations [63,64]. Individuals with high blood pressure exhibit slower baseline gait speed and a faster rate of decline compared to normotensive peers [25,65]. The LIFE-Pilot trial found that higher PP, an indicator of vascular health, correlates with slower gait speed [66]. Moreover, higher brachial artery pulse pressure, a marker of aortic stiffness, was linked to slower gait speed across a broad age range (5—70 years) [67]. Conversely, among adults aged ≥ 85 years, lower SBP is associated with increased ADL limitations and greater risk of function disability deterioration [68]. This relationship underscores that optimal blood pressure targets must be individualized to preserve locomotion capacity, particularly avoiding both sustained hypertension and excessive blood pressure reduction in the elderly.

Hypertension accelerates neurodegeneration via cerebral small vessel disease and exacerbates cognitive decline through cerebrovascular pathology, directly contributing to ADL limitations and significantly impairing self-care abilities and quality of life in older adults [69]. A population-based study of elderly Mexican Americans showed that individuals with MMSE scores below 21 had a 58% higher risk of developing ADL limitations over seven years compared to those with normal cognitive function [70]. Notably, our prior research in hospitalized older adults corroborated this relationship, showing that cognitive decline at admission predicted future ADL and IADL dependence [18]. This study similarly confirms that baseline cognitive decline predicts one-year incident ADL dependence in hypertensive older adults.

As a core indicator of functional ability, IC serves is a validated predictor of future disability [17,71]. Analysis of the UK Biobank database indicated that older adults with cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, are more prone to IC deficits, which are associated with increased CVD incidence and poorer prognosis [29]. Dai et al. [72] and the CHARLS study [73] reveal a cumulative effect of hypertension and ADL limitations, significantly elevating the risk of cardiovascular events and adverse outcomes. Additionally, a mean home SBP ≥ 135 mmHg is significantly associated with functional dependence in the elderly [74]. These findings underscore the clinical imperative for early identification and proactive management of IC decline in hypertensive older adults. Frameworks such as the WHO Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE), designed for continuous of IC domains monitoring, could provide a structured approach. To achieve this, we strongly suggest integrating the WHO ICOPE framework into hypertension management protocols. Continuous monitoring of IC core domains (especially locomotion and cognition) identifies essential targets for multimodal interventions (including precise blood pressure control, exercise training, cognitive stimulation, and nutritional support) to effectively interrupt the progression from hypertension to functional disability.

This study has several strengths. First, we simultaneously evaluated cognition, locomotion, vitality, psychology, and sensory domains, providing a comprehensive assessment of hypertensive impact on IC subcomponents and their contribution to disability. Second, our study specifically identifies the clinical association between declined IC and one-year functional disability risk specifically in hospitalized older hypertensive adults, underscoring the critical need to monitor gait speed and cognitive function for disability prevention.

Several limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, the retrospective cohort design, while providing longitudinal observation, limits causal inference. Specifically, the inability to precisely determine the onset of IC decline, track trajectories of individual IC domains, or confirm the exact timing of functional disability onset hinders our ability to delineate the complete causal pathway between the exposures (IC decline) and the outcome (functional disability). Future prospective studies with longitudinal assessments are needed to confirm causation and establish temporal sequences. Second, although SBP and PP negatively correlated with the IC composite score, further validation through methods such as simultaneous ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and objective physical performance assessment is required. Third, the hospital-based sampling limits generalizability to community-dwelling elders or non-hypertensive populations. Finally, dichotomization of IC domains may obscure subtle impairments and reduce measurement sensitivity.

Lower IC composite scores at admission predict an increased risk of functional disability 1-year post-discharge in elderly hypertensive inpatients. Higher SBP and PP negatively related to IC composite score, particularly impairing cognition and locomotion. Cognitive decline and locomotion impairment independently increase disability risk. Controlling elevated SBP and PP is crucial to mitigate cognitive and locomotion decline. Early identification and proactive management of declined IC are critical for multimodal intervention and disability prevention. Future research should validate these findings in larger prospective cohorts with subgroup analyses to refine risk stratification, elucidate underlying mechanisms (e.g., endothelial dysfunction) linking hypertension to IC decline, and test IC-based interventions, combining with targeted hypertension control to preserve functional independence and quality of life in elderly hypertensive populations.
