Mixed reality is a novel technology that adds digital elements to the real world to blend virtual and physical experiences. Recently, mixed reality has gained attention as a real-time intraoperative support modality that enhances the operator’s spatial awareness for detecting organs and vessels1. Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely used as a minimally invasive treatment; however, owing to its technical difficulty, endoscopists experience various levels of stress during the procedure regarding the possibility of perforation and bleeding. Mixed reality might help endoscopists accurately comprehend anatomical structures during ESD, preventing intraoperative adverse events without endoscopist stress. This is the first case report of intraoperative mixed reality support during colorectal ESD.

A 71-year-old woman was diagnosed with a 70-mm early colorectal cancerous tumor (cTis-T1a) in the lower rectum, and ESD was planned (Fig. 1). Preoperative three-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images revealed three thick, penetrating vessels underneath the tumor. Before ESD, standard triangulated language formats of the rectum, vessels, and tumor were created from CT images and uploaded to the Holoeyes MD system (Holoeyes Inc., Tokyo, Japan) to create virtual three-dimensional (3D) models2.

ESD was performed using a see-through head-mounted display (HoloLens; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) that enabled the superposition of a CT-based 3D model onto the real world (Fig. 2). During ESD, as recognized in the CT-based 3D MR model, we identified the penetrating vessels and safely avoided major bleeding without stress (Video 1). ESD was completed without any intraoperative adverse events, and the pathological diagnosis was intramucosal cancer with R0 resection.

Intraoperative mixed reality support for endoscopic submucosal dissection.

In this case report, the intraoperative mixed reality support contributed to promptly comprehending the spatial relationships between the tumor and thick penetrating vessels, and we successfully avoided intraoperative bleeding without stress. The intraoperative mixed reality support might be a next-generation ESD support modality.

I would like to thank Atsushi Urikura and Seiya Sato for creating the STL and virtual 3D models. We are grateful to Shintaro Iwata for suggesting the topic treated in this paper.
