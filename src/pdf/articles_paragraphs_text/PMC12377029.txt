To investigate the practices of Brazilian endocrinologists in educating
patients with adrenal insufficiency about stress-induced glucocorticoid
adjustments.

This was a cross-sectional online survey carried out with 280
endocrinologists across Brazil. The survey included demographic questions
and ten clinical vignettes assessing knowledge of appropriate glucocorticoid
adjustments during various stressful situations. All participants provided
informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the local Ethics
Committee. Statistical analysis compared responses based on physician
demographics and practice settings.

The mean percentage of correct answers was 63.3%. A significant proportion of
respondents (41.1%) incorrectly believed that patients should not
self-administer intramuscular hydrocortisone during an adrenal crisis. Older
physicians tended to provide more conservative (and potentially harmful)
glucocorticoid dosing recommendations in certain scenarios. Physicians
working in both outpatient and hospital settings demonstrated better
knowledge of patient education and emergency glucocorticoid
administration.

The results of this study revealed moderate adherence to guidelines among
Brazilian endocrinologists regarding adrenal insufficiency management and
patient education. There is a need for improved education on glucocorticoid
self-administration and targeted interventions to address knowledge gaps
across different clinical scenarios. Further research is needed to evaluate
the impact of these findings on patient outcomes and develop strategies to
optimize the management of adrenal insufficiency in Brazil.

An adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical
attention due to its rapid onset and potentially fatal consequences. It is
characterized by acute adrenal insufficiency, in which the production of
glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids is insufficient to meet the body’s
physiological demands during periods of stress or illness. This condition primarily
affects individuals with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, often resulting
from autoimmune destruction or surgical removal of the adrenal glands,
glucocorticoid withdrawal, or pituitary disorders that affect the secretion of
adrenocorticotropic hormone (1-3).

The hallmark signs of an adrenal crisis include severe hypotension, electrolyte
imbalances (such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), and metabolic abnormalities
(e.g., hypoglycemia). Prompt recognition and intervention are
crucial to prevent the rapid progression to shock, multiple organ failure, and death
(3). Despite its
potentially devastating consequences, adrenal crisis remains under-recognized and
inadequately managed in clinical practice. Epidemiological studies on adrenal crises
have found an incidence of approximately five and ten adrenal crises per one hundred
patient-years among patients with adrenal insufficiency treated with a standard
replacement dose of glucocorticoid (3-7).

Recent epidemiological studies highlight the significant burden of morbidity and
mortality associated with adrenal insufficiency and its acute exacerbations. This
underscores the critical need for improved patient education and physician guidance.
Effective patient education empowers individuals to recognize prodromal symptoms of
adrenal crisis, such as fatigue, nausea, and dizziness, and to understand the
importance of timely glucocorticoid supplementation during stressful situations.
Furthermore, attending physicians play a pivotal role in ensuring patients receive
adequate education, regular monitoring, and personalized management plans tailored
to their adrenal function status (8-10).

This study aimed to investigate the practices of Brazilian endocrinologists in
educating patients with adrenal insufficiency about stress-induced glucocorticoid
adjustments. Understanding current educational practices may help design continuing
medical education programs, contributing to highlighting strategies to optimize
patient care and minimize the risk of adrenal crisis in clinical practice.

This was a cross-sectional, observational study using data obtained from an online
survey. All participants provided informed consent, and the study protocol was
approved by the local Ethics Committee in June 2024 (CAAE 74855523.4.3001.5257).

Endocrinologists throughout Brazil were invited to participate in the study.

The calculation of the sample size utilized confidence intervals for population
proportions. Assuming a population of 5,000 endocrinologists in Brazil, as
reported by theSociedade Brasileira de Endocrinologia e
Metabologia, and considering a margin of error of 5% and a
confidence level of 90%, the estimated sample size was 257 respondents.

The survey was disseminated through multiple messaging platform groups (WhatsApp)
composed of endocrinologists across Brazil. The researchers, who are members of
these groups, requested further sharing of the survey with relevant
endocrinology communities. The invitation to participate in the survey included
a message outlining the study’s purpose and a link to the informed consent form
and online questionnaire. To maximize participation, the invitation was sent on
multiple occasions with biweekly intervals over an 8-week period. Survey
responses were downloaded in Excel for subsequent analysis.

The statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS), version 23.0 for MacOS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). In the
descriptive analysis, categorical variables were expressed as frequency and
percentage, while numerical variables were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation. Student’sttest was performed to compare numerical
variables between two groups. Analysis of variance (Anova) was used to compare
numerical variables among three groups, and the Tukeypost-hoctest was applied to identify significant differences between pairs of groups,
accordingly. The Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was applied to compare
categorical variables, as appropriate. Correlations between numerical variables
were analyzed using the Pearson test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered
significant.

A total of 280 physicians voluntarily completed the online questionnaire. The
study population had the following mean values: age 43.89 ± 10.5 years;
years since graduation 19.42 ± 10.8 years; and years of specialization
14.53 ± 11.3 years. The participants represented 24 of Brazil’s 27 states
(Figure 1), with the
following regional distribution, presented as numbers (percentages): North, 15
(5.4%); Northeast, 35 (12.5%); Central-West, 37 (13.3%); Southeast, 162 (58.1%);
and South, 30 (10.8%).

The majority of respondents (n = 212; 75.7%) had practiced for more than 5 years.
Regarding the practice setting, 81 participants (29.0%) worked exclusively in
the private sector, 26 (9.3%) exclusively in the public sector, and 172 (61.7%)
in both. Most participants (n = 195; 69.9%) worked solely in outpatient
clinics/offices, while 84 (30.1%) worked in both outpatient settings and
hospitals (including wards, emergency rooms, or intensive care units).

The mean percentage of correct answers across all questions was 63.3%. Question
#3 had the highest percentage of correct answers (87.9%). Conversely, Question
#2 had the highest percentage of responses posing potential harm to the patient
or risk of adrenal crisis (41.1%). A detailed breakdown of responses for each
question, categorized as representing potential harm/risk, not representing
harm/risk, and correct answers, is presented inFigure 2andTable 1.

Percentage of answers to each question categorized as correct (C),
incorrect but not representing harm (NH), incorrect with potencial
harm to the patient (H).

One participant did not answer questions #6, #8 and #9.

Answers were categorized as “correct”, “not representing harm/risk
(no harm),” and “representing potential harm/risk”.

No significant differences were observed in age, years since graduation, or years
since specialization based on medical practice setting, medical practice sector,
Brazilian region, or responses to Questions #1, #2, #4, #5, #7, #9, and #10.

Significant differences in age, years since graduation, and years since
specialization were found for responses to Questions #3, #6, and #8. In Question
#3, mean age was significantly higher among those whose responses posed
potential harm/risk of adrenal crisis (59.5 ± 12.4 years) compared with
those whose responses did not pose harm/risk (44.1 ± 13.4 years; p =
0.001) and those with correct answer (43.6 ± 10.0 years; p = 0.008).
Consequently, mean years since graduation and specialization were also
significantly higher in the group providing the response that posed potential
harm/risk (Table 1). In
Question #6, participants whose responses posed potential harm/risk (50.8
± 15.0 years) and those with the correct answer (45.8 ± 10.6
years) were significantly older than those whose responses did not pose
harm/risk (39.7 ± 8.2 years; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The
distribution of responses according to mean years since graduation and
specialization followed the same pattern (Table 1). In Question #8, the respondents’ mean age was
significantly higher for those marking the correct answer (45.0 ± 10.9
years) compared with those choosing the response posing no harm/risk (42.3
± 9.9 years; p = 0.03). The distribution of responses according to mean
years since specialization followed the same pattern (Table 1).

No significant differences were found in the frequencies of responses for
Questions #1, #2, #3, #5, #7, #9, and #10 based on years since graduation
(≤ 5 years versus > 5 years). However, respondents with > 5
years since graduation, compared with those with ≤ 5 years, had
significantly higher frequencies of correct answers for Questions #4 (64.6%versus45.6%, respectively; p = 0.01), #6 (64.0%versus39.7%, respectively; p = 0.001), and #8 (58.3%versus44.1%, respectively; p = 0.04) (Table 2).

No significant differences were found in the frequencies of response for
Questions #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, and #10 based on medical practice
setting (outpatient clinic/officeversusboth outpatient
clinic/office and hospital). However, respondents working in both settings,
compared with those working only on outpatient clinic/office, had
significantly higher frequencies of correct answers for Questions #1 (81.0%versus66.2%, respectively;p= 0.01)
and #2 (70.2%versus54.4%, respectively;p= 0.01) (Table
2).

No significant differences were found in the frequencies of responses for any
question based on medical practice sector (public and/or private)
(Table 2).

This is the first study conducted in Brazil evaluating how endocrinologists manage
adrenal insufficiency in situations that can precipitate adrenal crisis, along with
their practices regarding patient education. The findings of our study revealed
moderate adherence to guidelines among Brazilian endocrinologists, with an overall
correct response rate of 63.3%. While the highest percentage of correct answers was
observed for Question #3, which concerned glucocorticoid coverage during a cesarean
section (87.9%), a troubling high proportion of responses to Question #2, which
addressed the self-administration of glucocorticoid via intramuscular route during
situations of stress, could pose potential harm to the patient or risk of adrenal
crisis (41.1%). Understanding current practices in patient, family, and caregiver
education is crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce the morbidity and
mortality associated with adrenal insufficiency. The present study provides valuable
insights into the approaches of Brazilian endocrinologists to glucocorticoid dose
adjustments during stress and their patient education/counseling practices,
revealing both parallels and critical gaps compared with existing literature. These
results highlight strengths and areas for improvement, particularly concerning
physician education and patient guidance. Indeed, a study conducted by Kampmeyer and
cols. (11) across ten hospitals in
Germany, using a questionnaire with ten multiple-choice questions on adrenal
insufficiency symptoms and treatment, administered to physicians, revealed that,
considering all responses, 72.9% were correct. Furthermore, while emergency
treatment was deemed essential by 83.7%, only 20 physicians (9.6%) correctly
identified all situations necessitating therapy adjustment.

Data on patient adherence to glucocorticoid self-administration during stress are
limited, but existing studies reveal significant challenges related to patient
knowledge and skills. Harsch and cols. (12) found that 46% of patients were unable to manage their
corticosteroid therapy during stressful events. A similar scenario was found in a
German study (13) in which only
63% of patients felt adequately informed about stress dosing. This knowledge gap
likely contributes to low self-administration rates during adrenal crises. A large
international study (7) reported
that only 12% of patients experiencing an adrenal crisis self-administered a
glucocorticoid injection. This finding aligns with the results obtained from smaller
studies. A UK survey (14) found
that only 2 out of 26 patients were capable of self-administering parenteral
hydrocortisone, despite established healthcare policies promoting this skill.
Furthermore, a prospective, multicenter, questionnaire-based study (15) showed that glucocorticoid was
administered by a hospital physician in most cases of adrenal crisis (55.9%), while
self-injection and relative-assisted injection accounted for only 32.2% and 15.3% of
the cases, respectively. Similarly, according to the findings of the study by Hahner
and cols. (16), despite all
patients (n = 37) possessing an emergency card, only 7 of them (19%) were trained in
glucocorticoid self-injection. While intramuscular hydrocortisone is a cornerstone
of adrenal crisis prevention (2),
effective patient education and training for self-administration remain challenging.
Our study revealed an additional concern: a substantial proportion of responses
(41.1%) to Question #2 suggested potential patient harm or risk of adrenal crisis,
highlighting the need for improved education not only for patients but also for
assisting physicians. Promoting proficiency in glucocorticoid self-administration is
important not only for reducing individual morbidity and mortality but also for
decreasing healthcare system utilization and costs. Burger-Stritt and cols.
(15) observed that
patients who self-injected glucocorticoid were more likely to be treated on an
outpatient basis (62%) compared with those receiving glucocorticoid from a medical
professional (27%). It is important to consider the availability of medications
within the Brazilian context. Injectable hydrocortisone is primarily available in
hospitals, which may limit patient access to this medication for
self-administration. This limited availability may influence physician
recommendations, with some experienced physicians potentially advising patients to
increase oral prednisone doses as an alternative strategy in emergency situations.
Nevertheless, a significant advancement in supporting patient self-management is the
availability of a free emergency kit containing parenteral hydrocortisone, provided
by theAssociação Brasileira Addisoniana(ABA),
available athttps://www.abaddison.org.br/aba-kitemerg, upon physician request.
Therefore, improved physician and patient education regarding glucocorticoid
self-administration during stress is essential for reducing adrenal
insufficiency-related morbidity and mortality, a critical public health goal in
Brazil and worldwide.

The disparity observed among endocrinologists in choosing the correct responses
across the clinical scenarios underscores the need for targeted educational
interventions. While questions pertaining to acute, life-threatening scenarios, such
as cesarean section management (Question #3), yielded a high correct response rate
(87.9%), suggesting proficiency in managing severe stressors requiring immediate
intervention (2), questions
addressing more common, albeit less acute, scenarios demonstrated lower adherence to
guideline recommendations. For example, questions about management during flu-like
syndromes (Questions #7 and #8) or minor procedures (e.g., dental
calculus removal, Question #5) revealed significant gaps in knowledge. This pattern
mirrors findings by Hahner and cols. (4) and White & Arlt (7), who reported that adrenal crises frequently result from
inadequate glucocorticoid dose adjustments during mild-to-moderate stress, such as
gastrointestinal infections and flu-like illnesses - factors often underestimated by
clinicians. This is particularly concerning given the significant risk of
glucocorticoid underdosing in precipitating an adrenal crisis. Although systematic
dose-response studies are lacking, and thus recommended glucocorticoid doses for
adrenal crisis treatment are largely empirical, the 2016 Endocrine Society Consensus
Statement (2) provides specific
recommendations for glucocorticoid dose adjustment in various clinical scenarios,
which should be the basis of clinical practice.

The relationships between physician demographics and responses to several clinical
vignettes present a complex picture. While the mean age of the respondents who
answered Questions #3 (cesarean section) and #6 (gastroenteritis) correctly fell
between that of those who chose potentially harmful/risky responses (older group)
and those who choose non-harmful/non-risky responses (younger group), a higher rate
of correct answers for Questions #4 (vaginal delivery), #6, and #8 (afebrile flu)
was observed among physicians with over 5 years of experience. This seemingly
contradictory pattern may reflect the nuanced role of practical experience in the
management of adrenal insufficiency. Specifically, older physicians tended towards
more conservative recommendations regarding glucocorticoid stress dosing, which,
while leading to potentially harmful/risky responses in the scenarios presented in
Questions #3 and #6, resulted in the correct answer for Question #8, in which stress
dosing was unnecessary. While the cross-sectional design of our study limits our
ability to identify contributing factors to these observations, the overall trend
underscores the critical need for ongoing medical education in adrenal insufficiency
management. The lower performance of recent graduates suggests a potential gap in
medical school and postgraduate training, including residency programs, regarding
these specific clinical scenarios. A thorough review of medical education curricula
is warranted to ensure comprehensive, evidence-based education in the management of
adrenal insufficiency and the prevention of adrenal crisis.

An interesting finding emerged when comparing physician responses based on practice
setting. Physicians working in both outpatient clinics and hospital environments
performed significantly better on questions related to patient education (#1) and
emergency glucocorticoid administration (#2). This likely reflects their broader
exposure to acute care scenarios, consistent with the emphasis given by Grossman and
cols. on the importance of clinical judgment in adrenal insufficiency evaluation and
management (17). Nevertheless,
Harbeck and cols. (18) in a
cross-sectional study conducted with physicians from an Internal Medicine Department
of a university hospital, found that the current knowledge of physicians regarding
medical replacement strategies in adrenal insufficiency may be insufficient,
depending on their level of education and experience. Even physicians with training
in endocrinology demonstrated, in part, significant knowledge gaps. There may be a
need for additional structured information and training on adrenal insufficiency,
even in specialized hospitals.

This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. While the pre-calculated
sample size was not reached in some states, this was balanced by a larger
participation in other states, resulting in the achievement of the overall target
sample size. Furthermore, the study’s focus on adrenal insufficiency education may
have introduced some degree of information bias. Participants, aware of the study’s
objectives, may have been more likely to report behaviors they perceived as
desirable or aligned with those objectives. Another limitation of this study is that
the questionnaire did not explicitly differentiate between primary and secondary
adrenal insufficiency, which may have introduced variability in the responses. The
dissemination of the study through WhatsApp groups may have introduced some
selection bias. Endocrinologists active in these groups may be more knowledgeable
and up-to-date than the broader population of Brazilian endocrinologists,
potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. In short, if the
participants’ low performance on certain questions raises concerns about the risk of
adrenal crisis in patients, the situation in real-life settings could be even more
alarming. Due to the objective and direct design of the inquiries, only prednisone
was specified as the glucocorticoid, with hydrocortisone omitted based on the
rationale that prednisone is the most prevalent glucocorticoid in Brazilian clinical
practice due to its greater availability. For both glucocorticoids, the inquiries
could have incorporated more detailed information concerning dosages across diverse
clinical scenarios. Furthermore, the inclusion of family members or legal guardians
in clinical education, in addition to patients, is of significant importance.
Finally, while our questionnaire focused primarily on glucocorticoid administration,
it is important to acknowledge that the management of adrenal crisis involves more
than just corticosteroid replacement. Supportive measures, such as fluid
resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and identifying and treating the
precipitating cause, are critical. Furthermore, screening for serious illness is
essential in the emergency setting.

While presenting limitations, the present study has some positive aspects and offers
valuable insights. Participants were recruited from nearly all Brazilian states, and
their distribution across regions closely mirrored the national population
distribution reported by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística
(19). The Southeast
region, which concentrates both population and health services, had the highest
representation. Furthermore, this study is novel in its approach. To our knowledge,
no prior research has used a questionnaire with clinical vignettes to assess how
endocrinologists guide and manage stress in patients with adrenal insufficiency,
making direct comparison with existing literature challenging. This format allowed
us to pinpoint specific areas of expertise and knowledge gaps among these
professionals regarding critical aspects of adrenal insufficiency care. Addressing
the identified lack of awareness concerning patient education on glucocorticoid dose
adjustment and self-administration during stress is essential for developing
targeted continuing medical education interventions. Currently, national data on the
proportion of patients receiving adequate instruction on these topics are
lacking.

In conclusion, the average correct response rate was approximately 63%, indicating a
moderate level of knowledge regarding patient education in adrenal insufficiency,
particularly among physicians who graduated more than 5 years ago. However, the high
frequency of physicians (41%) who did not provide guidance on self-administration of
parenteral glucocorticoid was concerning. Identifying the reasons for this knowledge
gap is essential for developing effective continuing medical education
strategies.

groups.
