As the US population continues to age and diversify, so have treatment strategies for proximal humerus fractures (PHFs). The primary hypothesis of this study is that PHFs are increasing in prevalence with an associated increase in the rate of its surgical management.

The TriNetX US Collaborative Network database was queried for all patients diagnosed with PHFs between 2016 and 2022. Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to group patients into cohorts based on surgical versus nonsurgical treatment. Incidence and treatment rate differences were analyzed between demographic groups such as age, sex, and ethnicity.

A total of 74,781 PHFs were identified and analyzed between 2016 and 2022. The average overall PHF surgical incidence rate between 2016 and 2022 was 10.5%. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most common surgical treatment (68.5%). Overall utilization of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA/rTSA) surgical techniques increased from 2016 to 2022 for all fracture types (P< 0.0001), while ORIF (P= 0.0079) and hemiarthroplasty (P= 0.0432) utilization decreased. Women were less likely to undergo surgical treatment than men (odds ratio [OR], 0.9490;P< 0.05). White patients were more likely to receive surgical treatment than Black (OR, 0.7688;P< 0.0001) and Asian patients (OR, 0.7770;P= 0.0043).

Surgical management strategies have changed with TSA/rTSA becoming more frequently used for all fracture types with a decline in the utilization of ORIF and hemiarthroplasty. This study suggests a shift in surgical treatment strategies between 2016 and 2022, and reflects increased utilization of arthroplasty procedures for fracture management.

Current treatment algorithms are based on historical population trends and available fracture management implants. With the rise in the aging population and emergence of novel medical technology, there is a need to reassess PHF treatment guidelines to inform adequate healthcare planning and proper resource allocation. Examination of expansive databases, such as TriNetX, can provide this valuable information. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to present the current epidemiology and treatment trends of PHFs in the United States based on data obtained from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network.15Outlined in this paper are the differences found in incidence rates, treatment trends, and demographic distribution of PHFs between 2016 and 2022. The study's hypothesis is that PHFs have increased in prevalence with an associated increase in the rate of its surgical management.

The TriNetX database was retrospectively queried on January 27, 2024, consistent with retrospective study methodologies. The TriNetX database does not involve patient identifiable information and is subsequently exempt from Institutional Review Board review and approval. TriNetX is a global research network encompassing data from more than 170 healthcare organizations (HCOs) and more than 400 million patients.15It contains deidentified aggregate patient information covering procedures, diagnoses, medications, vitals, genomics, and demographics. HCOs involved in the TriNetX network contribute healthcare data in deidentified, pseudoanonymized, or limited data set formats, following local privacy regulations. These HCOs authorize the usage of these data for research purposes on the TriNetX platform. In return for providing data, HCOs incur no financial expenses and gain access to data query tools, analytics, visualization capabilities, and the necessary hardware for software execution. The deidentification process conforms to HIPAA Privacy Rule standards, as verified by a qualified expert, meeting the requirements of Section §164.514 (b) (1), ensuring HIPAA compliance.

The inclusion criteria for the study encompassed patients aged 0 to 90 years, diagnosed with a PHF between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022. This broad range was chosen to ensure a comprehensive analysis of fracture and treatment trends across all age groups, including both pediatric and elderly populations. The Neer classification system for PHFs was used along with the corresponding International Classification for Disease 10th Edition (ICD-10) diagnosis codes used in the TriNetX query builder to identify eligible patients.16The following cohorts were outlined in the initial queries: surgical neck fracture (ICD-10 code S42.211A, S42.212A, and S42.216A), 2-part fracture (ICD-10 code S42.221A, S42.222A, S42.229A, S42.251A, S42.252A, and S42.256A), 3-part fracture (ICD-10 code S42.231A, S42.232A, and S42.239A), and 4-part fracture (ICD-10 code S42.241A, S42.242A, and S42.249A). Greater tuberosity fractures were included as two-part fractures. Within each cohort, additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to analyze surgical treatment trends by using the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) system codes. Surgical treatment cohorts were outlined using the following CPT codes: open reduction and internal fixation of PHF (ORIF; CPT 23615), hemiarthroplasty (HA; CPT 23470), total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA; CPT 23472). The TriNetX database uses the same code for TSA and rTSA. Surgical treatment must have occurred within 4 weeks of the indexed PHF event to be included in the study. Determination of the nonsurgical cohorts within each fracture cohort was done by exclusion of the prior surgical CPT codes.

Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel (version 16.93.1). Initial statistical analysis consisted of stratifying PHF and treatment cohorts into demographic categories including age, sex, ethnicity, and race for each year. Comparison of cohorts used z-tests to determine notable differences between surgical and nonsurgical groups. Incidence rates for PHF and surgical treatment were established usingP-values to determine statistical significance (P≤ 0.05). Surgical outcomes for demographic groups were determined using odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Calculation of incidence proportions was done using TriNetX incidence and prevalence calculators by inputting PHF ICD-10 codes as the numerator, and overall number of ICD-10 diagnoses as the denominator to get total patients for that year.

A total of 74,781 PHFs were identified and analyzed between 2016 and 2022. Patients ranged from ages 0 to 90 with a mean age of 67.1 ± 18.6. Fracture risk was positively correlated with age as the 65 to 90 age group accounted for the highest percentage of fractures, 63.5% (P< 0.0001). In addition, patients were more likely to be female (67.7%) and White (77.7%; Table1).

From 2016 to 2022, the incidence proportion of PHFs increased from 0.027% in 2016 to 0.042% in 2022 (P< 0.0001; Figure1).

Graph of incidence proportions of proximal humerus fractures.

The most common PHF was a two-part proximal humerus fracture (48.2%), followed by nondisplaced surgical neck fractures (43.8%) three-part surgical neck fractures (4.8%), and four-part surgical neck fractures (3.1%). The overall incidence rates of all types of fractures remained unchanged between 2016 and 2022, except for three-part surgical neck fractures, which significantly increased from 4.1% in 2016 to 5.1% in 2022 (P< 0.001).

The overall surgical incidence rate for PHFs between 2016 and 2022 was 10.5%. This rate increased from 10.1% in 2016 to 11% in 2022 (P= 0.0762). The mean age of patients undergoing surgical treatment was 66.4 ± 15.9. The age group with the highest rates of surgical intervention was the 40 to 64 age group (12%). The 65 to 90 age group significantly increased in surgical rates from 9.7% in 2016 to 10.9% in 2022 (P= 0.0411). Women were less likely than men to get surgery for their PHFs (10.4% vs. 10.7%, OR, 0.95, 0.9026 to 0.9988). Patients identifying as White were more likely to undergo surgical intervention when compared with Black patients (11.2% vs. 8.6%, OR, 0.7688, 0.6932 to 0.8526) and Asian patients (11.2% vs. 8.7%, OR, 0.7770, 0.6533 to 0.9241; Table2).

Two-part fractures were the most common types of fractures but were only operated on 8.1% of the time. Compared with surgical neck fractures, two-part surgical neck fractures (OR, 0.8308, 0.7919 to 0.8717) were less likely to be operated on. Compared with surgical neck fractures, three-part surgical neck fractures (OR, 2.9195, 2.718 to 3.1359) and four-part surgical neck fractures (OR, 4.8681, 4.5248 to 5.2375) were more likely to be operated on. From 2016 to 2022, surgical treatment of four-part surgical neck fractures increased at a significant rate from 36.9% in 2016 to 50.7% in 2022 (P= 0.0138). Surgical treatment increased from 2016 to 2022 for all other types of fractures, but not at significant rates (Table3).

Overall, ORIF was the most common operation done to repair PHFs accounting for 68.5% of all operations. TSA/rTSA was done 28.9% of the time and hemiarthroplasty (HA) 2.5%. From 2016 to 2022, the incidence rate of ORIF significantly decreased from 74.1% in 2016 to 64.8% in 2022 (P= 0.0079). HA incidence rate also significantly decreased from 2.9% in 2016 to 1.7% in 2022 (P= 0.0432). The incidence rates of TSA/rTSA for PHFs significantly increased from 23% in 2016 to 33.5% in 2022 (P< 0.0001; Figure2). For surgical neck fractures, patients were more likely to undergo ORIF than HA (OR, 0.0255, 0.0201 to 0.0324) and TSA/rTSA (OR, 0.3362, 0.3083 to 0.3667). The rates of TSA/rTSA increased for surgical neck fractures from 21.1% in 2016 to 27.5% in 2022 (P= 0.0532). For two-part surgical neck fractures, patients underwent ORIF 73.3% of the time and were more likely to undergo ORIF compared with HA (OR, 0.0317, 0.0253 to 0.0398) and TSA/rTSA (OR, 0.3398, 0.3103 to 0.3721). The rates of TSA/rTSA for two-part surgical neck fractures significantly increased from 20.1% in 2016 to 28.8% in 2022 (P= 0.0154). For three-part surgical neck fractures, patients were more likely to undergo ORIF compared with HA (OR, 0.0214, 0.0136 to 0.0335) and TSA/rTSA (OR, 0.2917, 0.2495 to 0.3410). The rates of TSA/rTSA for three-part surgical neck fractures significantly increased from 18.1% in 2016 to 34.4% in 2022 (P= 0.0205). For four-part surgical neck fractures, TSA/rTSA was the most common surgical treatment with 56.2% of patients receiving a shoulder replacement. Patients were less likely to get ORIF than TSA/rTSA (OR, 0.6295, 0.5495 to 0.7211) and less likely to get HA compared with TSA/rTSA (OR, 0.0974, 0.0761 to 0.1248). The rates of TSA/rTSA significantly increased from 25.5% in 2016 to 35.5% in 2022 (P= 0.0428; Table4).

Based on the results, although the overall incidence of PHF has increased over the study period, there was not a notable change in the rate of its surgical management versus nonsurgical management. Our study found a similar rate of surgical intervention for PHF in 2022 because there was in 2016, with the most likely demographic of patients to suffer a PHF to be an elderly White female. However, although there was no notable change in the incidence of surgical management, the surgical technique did change with markedly less patients undergoing HA and ORIF, and more undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty.

The results of this study are in line with similar studies and the expected trends reported in the literature regarding the incidence and demographics of PHF. PHFs are most likely to occur in the patient population of older than 65 years, with higher rates in patients who are female and White. Khatib et al17found that patients older than 65 accounted for 71.5% of total PHFs and that 79.8% of the fractures happened in women. In addition, a 2020 study analyzing Medicare registry data both found that the group with the highest incidence of PHF was elderly women older than 80 years. Walter et al18also reported a markedly higher mortality rate at 1 year for patients managed nonsurgically than surgically, 16.4% vs. 9.3%, respectively. The demographics of patients suffering PHF can be attributed to the poor quality bone located with the proximal humerus, exacerbated further in patients with osteoporosis, and the high likelihood of suffering a traumatic effect to that area after a fall resulting in the fracture.

ORIF remained the most common procedure performed for PHFs 68.5% of the time followed by TSA/rTSA 28.9% of the time; however, utilization of ORIF declined from 2016 to 2022 and TSA/rTSA markedly increased, suggesting a shift in the surgical strategies used to treat PHFs over this period. The rate of ORIF and HA relatively decreased by 12.5% and 42.3%, respectively, from 2016 to 2022, while rates of TSA/rTSA relatively increased by 45.9%. Patel et al13found that rates of HA decreased by 81.4%, ORIF decreased by 25.7%, and TSA decreased by 80.5%, while rates of rTSA increased by 1841.4%. In addition, patients were 22.6 times more likely to receive an rTSA in 2019 compared with 2010 (95% CI, 15.58 to 32.91). Papalia et al21reported that ORIF was the most common procedure accounting for 72.2% of the operations performed. In both the 50 to 64 and >65 age groups between 2010 and 2020, rates of HA and ORIF markedly decreased, while rates of rTSA markedly increased.

This study has several limitations, including those characteristic of large deidentified databases. Since the database was only searched for PHFs and surgical/nonsurgical treatments retrospectively, trends on outcomes and complications could not be obtained. In addition, queries were done based on ICD-10 and CPT codes. With medical coding, there is always a possibility of human error or subjectivity to the codes used. It was established earlier that classification of PHFs using the Neer classification system is difficult and could be inconsistent between surgeons. An additional limitation of this study was the inability to distinguish between TSA and rTSA because they have the same CPT code 23472. In the discussion, it was assumed that most operations under this category were rTSA given the popularity of this procedure, but this number most likely was higher than true because it also included TSA. Finally, the TriNetX queries were set up where the surgical intervention was only counted if it happened within 1 month of the fracture diagnosis. This was done to ensure operations were correlated with the initial fracture but may have counted fractures that treated with a delayed operation as nonsurgical.

Based on these study results, PHF prevalence has increased from 2016 to 2022. Surgical management rates have increased, but not at a notable rate. However, surgical management strategies have changed with TSA/rTSA becoming more frequently used for all fracture types. ORIF and HA techniques seemed to decline in utilization. This study suggests a shift in surgical treatment strategies between 2016 and 2022. However, most of the PHFs continue to be treated nonsurgically, and the decision regarding surgical intervention must be made between the surgeon and patient based on their fracture, lifestyle, living situation, and overall quality of life.
