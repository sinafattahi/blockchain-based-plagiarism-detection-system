Diabetes is a significant modifiable risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. There are currently no effective treatments that delay or reverse the progression of cognitive dysfunction. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that specific antidiabetes medications hold promise in improving cognitive function. However, the comparative effects of various antidiabetic drug classes on cognitive protection remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate and compare the cognitive benefits of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin on achieving mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remission in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The LIGHT-MCI trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, superiority trial involving T2D patients with MCI, consisting of a 48-week core study followed by an extension phase through to 76 weeks. A total of 396 participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1 to receive liraglutide, empagliflozin or linagliptin treatment. The primary outcome measure is the efficacy difference of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin in achieving MCI remission in individuals with T2D. The key secondary outcome measures include changes in scores of general cognition and various cognitive subdomains (including processing speed, executive function, immediate memory, visuospatial construction ability, language, attention and delayed memory), basic and instrumental daily living ability, MRI-derived normalised measures of total brain volume, cerebral microstructures, cortical and nuclear volume, white matter hyperintensity, volume, white matter microstructural integrity, odour-induced brain activation and resting-state functional connectivity, olfactory function and metabolic parameters.

The LIGHT-MCI trial has received approval from the Ethics Committees of the Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University Medical School (2022-092-02) and other participating centres in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP E6). Informed consent is required for participation. Findings from this trial are disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, newsletters and social media.

The multicentre randomised controlled design of the LIGHT-MCI study enhances internal validity and the generalisability of the study findings.

The three-arm design allows a head-to-head comparison of cognitive benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors against an active control arm.

The primary outcome is assessed through a comprehensive neuropsychological battery administered by trained personnel, with prespecified mild cognitive impairment remission criteria, ensuring the validity of outcome measurements.

The secondary outcomes included alterations in brain structure and function, olfactory function and metabolic parameters, to indicate potential mechanisms underlying the cognitive benefits.

The study is a pragmatic open-label trial, with inevitable potential confounding bias.

There is growing evidence that certain antidiabetes medications hold promise in improving cognitive function. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown potential in restoring brain glucose metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease, offering a putative repurposed candidate against cognitive dysfunction.9 10Exploratory or post-hoc analyses of randomised trials suggest GLP-1 RAs versus placebo may protect against cognitive decline.11,14Also, the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in cognitive function has emerged as another focal point. Population-based cohort studies point to a significantly reduced risk of dementia associated with SGLT2 inhibitor usage, yet clear neuroprotective effects from prospective randomised controlled trials remain lacking.15,18Linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidases 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, showed neutral effects on cognition in the CARMELINA and CAROLINA-COGNITION trials.19 20Accumulating studies have explored the cognitive benefits of a specific class of antidiabetic agents, yet there is limited evidence informing their head-to-head comparisons of cognitive effects. Our preliminary 16-week randomised trial comparing liraglutide, dapagliflozin and acarbose demonstrated liraglutide’s superior effects on restoring odour-induced brain activation and cognitive domains in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients.21However, these findings should be interpreted in light of methodological limitations including a modest sample size, short intervention period and reliance on neuroimaging surrogate endpoints.

Therefore, we have further designed a multicentre, randomised, superiority trial on head-to-head comparison of efficacy of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin on MCI remission in T2D. The results are expected to address knowledge gaps and inform clinical decision-making by providing robust evidence.

The LIGHT-MCI study is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of three add-on therapies to metformin monotherapy for MCI remission in T2DM patients. Using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either liraglutide, empagliflozin or linagliptin for the 48-week core study period. Those completing the core study may opt for an additional 28-week extension phase after providing informed consent, resulting in a total possible intervention duration of 76 weeks. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID:NCT05313529).

A total of 396 eligible participants will be consecutively enrolled from five clinical subcentres, including Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing First Hospital, Wuxi People’s Hospital, Changzhou Second People’s Hospital and Nanjing Jiangning Hospital. The complete list of participating study sites is maintained in the ‘Contacts/Locations’ section of the trial’s registration at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID:NCT05313529). Participating centres were chosen based on the following essential criteria: (a) membership in Diabetes- Cognitive Dysfunction Consortium; (b) formal written agreements to ensure protocol adherence and compliance monitoring, supported by institutional ethical approvals and good clinical practice (GCP) certification; (c) tertiary hospitals with certified diabetes and neurology clinics, enabling comprehensive clinical and cognitive assessments; (d) multidisciplinary teams with documented research experience in the fields of endocrinology and cognitive health; (e) capacity to implement the required data collection and management systems for accurate data handling. To ensure adequate representativeness of each site, although a competitive enrolment approach is adopted, adjustments to the actual enrolment numbers from each subcentre will be made as necessary to maintain a relatively balanced distribution of participants across subcentres. Ideally, the final enrolment from any subcentre should be less than 50% of the total study cases.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented inbox 1. Notably, as a pragmatic trial aiming to reflect real-world clinical practice, the study intentionally omitted restrictions on diabetes duration and sleep conditions to preserve natural population heterogeneity and enhance generalisability. This inclusive approach allows for more robust evaluation of treatment effects across diverse patient characteristics while maintaining clinical relevance. The potential influence of these unconstrained variables will be addressed through rigorous sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses.

Patients will be selected by endocrinologists qualified in neuropsychological assessment during their routine follow-up consultation at the endocrinology department of each centre participating in the study. During the consultation, the endocrinologists will perform a brief cognitive screening for MCI with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and physical examination, document all concomitant treatments and verify inclusion and exclusion criteria. Details regarding prohibited concomitant medications are provided in theonline supplemental file 1. The endocrinologists will also inform patients and answer all their questions about the objective, the nature of constraints, foreseeable risks and benefits expected from the study. The doctor will precisely define the patients’ rights in relation to biomedical research. A copy of the patient information and consent form will then be given to the patients by the investigating doctor. After this information meeting, patients will be allowed a period of time to consider their decision concerning participation.

In this trial, after discontinuing other antidiabetes medications besides metformin under guidance for 1 week, participants will be given another antidiabetes medication of liraglutide, empagliflozin or linagliptin with an intervention duration of 48 weeks in the core study. The participants who entered the extension study will continue on the same study medication to which they are randomised in the core study up to 28 weeks. For those patients who have used SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs or DPP4 inhibitors for less than half a year, a wash-out period of 3 months with gliclazide or basal insulin is additionally required.

Liraglutide (Victoza) is supplied as a disposable prefilled pen with the dosage of 18 mg for 3 mL per vial. It should be stored refrigerated at 4°C and has a shelf life of 36 months, with a reduced shelf life of 14 days after first use. Participants will initiate treatment with liraglutide at a starting dose of 0.6 mg administered via daily subcutaneous abdominal injection. The dose will be escalated in a stepwise manner over an 8-week titration period, with incremental increases to 1.2 mg and subsequently to the target maintenance dose of 1.8 mg, based on individual tolerance as assessed by the investigator. To optimise tolerability and minimise gastrointestinal adverse events, the protocol incorporates a flexible dose adjustment strategy that includes: (a) individualised adjustment of dose-escalation intervals within the 8-week period, (b) dose reduction to 1.2 mg as the maximum tolerated dose when necessary and (c) protocol-permitted treatment pauses of variable duration for managing persistent adverse events. All dose modifications will be implemented at the investigator’s discretion following comprehensive clinical evaluation of each participant’s response and tolerability profile.

Empagliflozin tablets (Jardiance) are available in a specification of 10 mg per tablet and are taken orally. The tablets should be stored in a cool, dark place and kept sealed, with a shelf life of 24 months. The medication is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG (Germany) and packaged by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals (Shanghai). Patients are instructed to take one 10 mg tablet daily, orally before breakfast.

Linagliptin tablets (Tradjenta) are available in a specification of 5 mg per tablet and are taken orally. The tablets should be stored in a cool, dark place and kept sealed, with a shelf life of 24 months. This medication is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals. Patients are instructed to take one 5 mg tablet daily, orally before breakfast.

If glucose control does not meet standard during follow-up (fasting blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L more than twice or HbA1c≥8.5%), additional intervention with gliclazide (starting from 30 mg once daily and maximum dose not exceeding 120 mg) or basal insulin (insulin glargine injection) will be given. The actual glycaemic control target and additional treatment therapy will be determined by the investigators according to the individual conditions of participants.

All participants are trained in the daily use of self-monitoring strategies to encourage adherence to each assigned medication. In addition, they also receive lifestyle education on how to improve glycaemic management through diet and exercise. The consultation and advice are delivered through regular telephone interviews or follow-up visits.

Medication will be dispensed at week 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64 by each trial centre.

The primary outcome measure of the trial is the efficacy of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin, administered as add-on therapy with the metformin monotherapy, in achieving MCI remission in individuals with T2D at 48 weeks of treatment.

MCI mitigation is defined by three criteria: an education-adjusted score of the MoCA ≥26, no cognitive deficits in any explored subdomain (with scores above the cut-off scores in all tests as detailed intable 1), including processing speed, executive function, immediate memory, visuospatial construction ability, language, attention and delayed memory, evaluated by Trail-Making Test, Stroop Color-Word Test and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), respectively, and preservation of ability to perform instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) with a Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) score<5.

Immediate memory, visuospatial construction ability, language, attention and delayed memory are assessed by Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Processing speed and executive function are evaluated with the following time tests: the Trail Making Test (parts A and B) and the Stroop Color-Word Test (parts I, II and III).

A longer time for completion (in s) represents worse processing speed and executive function. RBANS scores are standardised for age.

Scores of general cognition, including MMSE, MoCA and total score of RBANS and various cognitive subdomains, including processing speed, executive function, immediate memory, visuospatial construction ability, language, attention and delayed memory.

Basic activities of daily living (BADL) and IDAL ability measured by the Barthel index and FAQ score, respectively.

MRI-derived normalised measures of total brain volume, cortical and nuclear volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, white matter integrity, glymphatic function, odour-induced brain activation and resting-state functional connectivity.

Olfactory function, comprised of olfactory threshold, odour identification and odour memory.

Glucose metabolism indicators, including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting and 2 hour postprandial plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide, pancreatic islet function and insulin resistance indexes as calculated by the Homeostasis model assessment.

Lipid metabolism indicators, including lipid profile (triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), visceral and liver fat content.

Anthropometric indicators, including blood pressure, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference and body composition analysis.

Liver stiffness and hepatic fat attenuation confirmed by the FibroTouch system to assess the liver fibrosis and fatty liver levels.

The effects of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin on the 48-week change in blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease-specific pathophysiology and neural injury.

The efficacy difference of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin treatment in achieving MCI remission at the end of the core study is maintained at 76 weeks of treatment.

Secondary outcome measures of the extension phase remained the same as those of the core study and only the time points of evaluation are at 76 weeks of treatment.

A copy of the patient information and a signed informed consent form will be given to the patient.

The original will be kept by the investigator, in a safe place inaccessible to third parties.

After provision of informed consent, visit 1 starts a 7-day screening period during which the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria are checked and basic demographics are collected (including from clinical examination, laboratory measurements, global cognition, BADL, subjective sleep assessment, anxiety and depression assessments). Eligible subjects are invited to the baseline visit (the introduction period continuing for 7 days), where all outcome measures (including laboratory examinations, genomic analysis, blood-based biomarkers, comprehensive cognitive assessments, IADL assessment, structural and functional MRI, olfactory function measurement, body composition analysis and liver ultrasound transient elastography) are assessed prior to the randomisation step. Then participants are randomised into the liraglutide, empagliflozin or linagliptin group and study drugs are dispensed. Visit 3 is conducted at 28 (week 4)±2 days after randomisation, with a particular focus on assessment of drug safety and adverse events. Further follow-ups are conducted at 56 (week 8)±3, 112 (week 16)±3, 168 (week 24)±3, 224 (week 32)±3, 280 (week 40)±3, 336 (week 48)±7 in the core study. Subjects who complete the core study will have the option to participate in the extension phase. The extension phase will continue for up to 28 weeks, and clinical and safety assessments will be conducted every 8 weeks. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate), anthropometrics (height, weight, waist/hip circumference) and peripheral blood glucose are measured at every visit. Metabolic assessments (HbA1c, lipid profiles) and organ function tests (liver, renal) are performed at baseline, weeks 24, 48 and 76, alongside cognitive screening (MoCA), body composition analysis (InBody 770) and liver ultrasound transient elastography. The remaining primary and secondary outcome measures, consisting of oral glucose and insulin tolerance test, comprehensive neuropsychological testing (MMSE, RBANS, Trail Making Test, Stroop Colour-Word Test), functional assessments (BADL, IADL), blood-based biomarkers, structural and functional MRI, as well as olfactory function measurements, are conducted at baseline, week 48 and week 76. The clinical assessments are conducted by a trained research nurse and a trained research doctor, when indicated. The neuropsychological assessments are administered and scored by the same certified examiner at each research site. Of note, all assessments are conducted by independent assessors who are blinded to treatment allocation. The trial design and schedule of assessments is shown infigure 1andonline supplemental file 3.

Participation in the study needs to be stopped for medical, safety, regulatory or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations and GCP.

This superiority trial is powered for two independent primary comparisons (liraglutide vs linagliptin and empagliflozin vs linagliptin), each tested at two-sided α=0.05 without multiplicity adjustment. Based on our pilot data, we assumed 48-week MCI remission rates of 50% (liraglutide) and 30% (empagliflozin). Previous studies of DPP4 inhibitors have shown a neutral effect on cognitive function, but the reversion rates from MCI to normal cognition are estimated to be approximately 10–15% in clinic-based studies, and therefore its MCI remission rate is assumed to be 15% in our study.22 23These assumptions yielded absolute differences of 35% (liraglutide vs linagliptin) and 15% (empagliflozin vs linagliptin). Using PASS V.15.0 (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA;www.ncss.com/software/pass) with 80% power and 1:1:1 allocation, the required sample sizes were 25 per group for liraglutide and 118 per group for empagliflozin comparisons. To ensure adequate power for both prespecified tests, we selected the larger sample size (118 per group), ultimately enrolling 132 per arm (total n=396) after accounting for 10% attrition.

This trial adopts a block randomisation method with a block size of six, with each centre competing for enrolment. The randomisation list will be centrally generated by the statistician of the LIGHT-MCI trial platform before the start of the trial. This randomisation list and a document describing the randomisation procedure will be kept confidential by the LIGHT-MCI statistician who is not involved in participant screening or treatment. Participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be assigned a random number by a web-based system (JianDaoYun, Fanruan Software) and will be allocated to the ‘liraglutide’, ‘empagliflozin’, or ‘linagliptin’ group by randomisation in a 1:1:1 ratio after all baseline assessments are completed. When it is confirmed that the subjects are successfully enrolled, the researcher applies for the randomisation allocation process, fills in the date and subject label and the randomisation process manager matches the random number and returns it to the applicant to complete the single randomisation allocation process.

Given the inherent challenges of complete blinding due to differing drug administration routes (oral vs injectable), this study has implemented a rigorous evaluator blinding approach to uphold research integrity. The study involves four independent teams with strictly segregated workflows, including intervention, evaluation, statistical and monitoring teams. The intervention team is dedicated to participant enrolment and clinical management. The evaluation team conducts all participant assessments and collects anonymised data while remaining blinded to group allocation. All assessors underwent standardised blinding protocol training and worked in controlled environments free of treatment identifiers. The statistical team, unaware of study cohorts, performs data cleaning and verification according to standard procedures. Finally, the statistical team will lock the database once declared complete and accurate and will perform statistical analysis based on the pre-specified plan.

If accidental unblinding occurs, it is immediately documented (time, cause, personnel) and reported to the independent data and safety monitoring committee (IDSMC). The unblinded assessor is replaced, and affected data are flagged for sensitivity analysis. Preventive measures include enhanced staff training on blinding protocols, regular environmental audits and ongoing process monitoring by the study coordinator. All unblinding events and corrective actions will be transparently reported in the final publication. Statistical analyses will also include pre-unblinding and post-unblinding comparisons to assess potential outcome impacts.

Electronic data capture (EDC) system is used for data entry and management in this trial. The data management software used is Jiandaoyun, developed by Fanruan company. The software Jiandaoyun has been developed to meet the regulatory requirements. The software complies with the FDA requirements regarding IT systems used in clinical trials (‘Guidance for Computerised System Used in Clinical Trials’) as well as electronic signature (‘21CFR part 11’) and various international norms (CDISC/CDASH, ICH, GCP 2001/20/CE). Information extracted from participants’ medical records is anonymised, captured through an electronic case report form (eCRF), and diligently entered into the EDC system by trained data management personnel. The eCRF must be completed during or after each study visit. Access to the eCRF for data entry or review will require distinct individual access codes assigned uniquely to the site staff members who will be entering study data and those involved in study oversight who may review study data. Data are collected within the eCRF, to which the sponsor and sites monitors have exclusively ‘read only’ access. Rigorous electronic checks, source data verification and clinical monitoring protocols are implemented to guarantee the accuracy of data in comparison to original source documentation. The database must be closed in order to make the final analysis. The closure of the database is performed by the Jiandaoyun software.

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population will serve as the primary population for all efficacy analyses. The ITT population consists of all randomised participants with available data at baseline analysed according to their allocated treatment group irrespective of whether treatment was administered or not. Additionally, the per-protocol (PP) population will also be conducted for supportive analysis. The PP population includes only those participants who completed the study according to the protocol and reached all primary endpoints without major deviations. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment they actually received. The As-treated (AT) population, which includes all eligible patients who started the study treatment (at least one dose), will be used for the safety analysis in this study.

Participant demographic characteristics and other baseline information will be summarised by treatment group. Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies (with percentages). Continuous variables will be reported as means (SD) or medians (IQR) for non-normality of distribution. For the primary outcome, the generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models based on ITT population will be used with the Poisson family function and log link function, treating group variable as categorical with the control arm as the reference group, generating risk ratios and 95% CIs of the two experimental arms. For secondary and exploratory outcomes, the linear mixed-effects models on the ITT population will be conducted for continuous response variables. In the mixed-effects models, participant is assumed to be a random effect, and group, time and a treatment by time interaction term (which, if significant, will be indicative of efficacy) are assumed to be estimable fixed effects. Subgroup analyses will examine treatment effect heterogeneity according to baseline characteristics, including but not limited to age, sex, education and diabetes duration. Full details will be provided in the pre-specified statistical analysis plan.

For missing primary outcome data, we will conduct sensitivity analyses considering both best-case and worst-case scenarios. For missing secondary and exploratory outcome data, we will use mixed-effects models with maximum likelihood estimation, which provides valid inference under the missing-at-random assumption by incorporating all available longitudinal data. To further ensure robustness, we will conduct sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation by chained equations with 50 imputations, including baseline characteristics, observed outcome trajectories and treatment adherence as predictors.

Evaluations of safety will be performed on the AT population. The incidence of adverse events (including changes from baseline in physical examination), out-of-normal-range laboratory safety test variables and out-of-range vital signs, along with change from baseline in laboratory safety test variables and vital sign measurements, will be summarised by treatment group. The incidence of adverse events among the three groups will be analysed by χ2test.

Additional supportive analysis on a PP basis will be carried out to examine the conclusions’ robustness to different assumptions about departures from the randomisation procedure. A full, detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalised before database lock and treatment unblinding. No formal interim analysis has been planned for the trial. All analyses will be performed using SAS V.9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). A p value of <0.05 (two-tailed) will be considered statistically significant.

The chief investigator holds overall responsibility for the conduct of the trial, while the trial management group is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the trial.

The trial scientific committee, comprised of independent clinicians and an independent statistician, acts as the oversight body for the trial on behalf of the sponsor. This committee will take responsibility for monitoring and guiding overall progress, scientific standards and operational delivery, ensuring the protection of participants’ rights and safety throughout the trial. The scientific committee will meet at least four times a year to monitor subject accrual and to monitor compliance with the protocol at individual study sites. The scientific committee will be blinded to subject treatment assignments during the trial.

An IDSMC will be established and composed of at least three members: an endocrinologist, a statistician and a vigilance specialist, independent from the study scientific team. The objective of the IDSMC is to review safety and progress toward completion of study. The IDSMC charter, outlining membership, terms of reference, roles, responsibilities, authority, decision-making processes and interactions (including the timing of meetings, methods of providing information to and from the committee, frequency and format of meetings, statistical issues and relationships with other committees) for this trial is established, reviewed and approved prior to the inaugural committee meeting. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be reviewed by IDSMC to determine the cause of these events and take any necessary measures to ensure participant safety. Following each meeting, the IDSMC will provide the study team with information concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to continuing, changing or terminating the trial. The IDSMC will provide a summary of the committee findings to the sponsor and coordinating investigator.

Safety and tolerability assessments will encompass comprehensive monitoring and recording all adverse events and serious adverse events, alongside routine checks of vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events are any untoward medical occurrence in patients or clinical investigation subjects administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigational drug-related adverse events in the trial mainly include gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, bloating and abdominal pain, liver or kidney damage, urogenital infection, rash, headache, hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

Serious adverse events are defined as undesirable signs or medical conditions that are fatal or life-threatening, necessitate hospitalisation, result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or are otherwise medically significant.

All adverse events and serious adverse events, whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly observed or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-specific case report forms. Each adverse event will be detailed concerning its duration, intensity, actions taken and outcomes. The investigator must evaluate the causal relationship between the study drugs and the adverse event. If the adverse event is not related to the study, the investigator must determine the alternative causality (diabetes, concomitant treatment, other disease, etc). To ensure participants’ safety, all serious adverse events will be promptly reported to the chief investigator, data monitoring and ethics committee within 24 hours and processed in a timely manner. Any serious adverse event that is ongoing when the subject completes or discontinues the study will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilised or returned to baseline status.

The LIGHT-MCI trial has obtained ethical approvals from the institutional review boards of all participating centres, which include Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University Medical School (2022-092-02), Nanjing First Hospital (KY20230210-01-KS-01), Wuxi People’s Hospital (2024-IIT-04), Changzhou Second People’s Hospital ((2024)KY07-01) and Nanjing Jiangning Hospital (2024-03-009-K01). All approvals were granted in full compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation for GCP (ICH GCP E6). This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 05313529). All participants provide written informed consent for their participation and biological collection, and clinical trial insurance is purchased to offer compensation for any physical harm, health impairment or death that may occur during the trial. Any significant modifications to the study protocol initiated by the coordinating investigator must receive prior approval from the ethics committee before implementation. Should such substantial amendments be required, all relevant documentation, particularly the informed consent forms, will be promptly updated to reflect these changes.

The results of the core study are expected in 2026 and will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed medical journals, as well as presentations at relevant national and international conferences. Data arising from and samples collected during the trial will not be made publicly available but will be available for collaborative sharing, after the main results of the trial have been published, and upon application to and approval by the trial management group.

No patient is involved. The development of the research question and outcome measures was informed by clinical observations and existing literature on cognitive benefits of certain antidiabetic agents. Patients were not directly involved in the study’s design, recruitment or conduct. The study design relied on previous protocols and expert consultations. Results will be shared with participants through follow-up appointments. The intervention’s burden was not formally assessed by patients, but the protocol aimed to minimize the burden based on prior studies. There are no patient advisers to thank in the contributorship statement or acknowledgements.

The current protocol document is V.4.0, dated 1 August 2024. Enrolment in the LIGHT-MCI trial commenced in November 2022. Currently, enrolment is ongoing with 300 participants enrolled as of 1 October 2024 and is projected to conclude in January 2025. The last participant is expected to reach the primary endpoint of the core study in January 2026. The extension phase will continue until the summer of 2026. No interim analyses are planned, thus results on outcomes will not inform decisions to stop the study. Any serious adverse events, however, will be reviewed, and if there is any indication that these are linked to the intervention, consideration will be given to discontinuing the trial on the advice of the trial sponsor and participating clinical services. Failure to recruit could also be a reason to stop the trial.

The LIGHT-MCI trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, parallel-controlled, superiority clinical trial with a core phase and an extension phase designed to evaluate the cognitive benefits of liraglutide, empagliflozin and linagliptin in T2D patients with MCI. To our knowledge, there is no other randomised clinical trials underway that could address the question.

Diabetes is an established risk factor for cognitive dysfunction, while intensive glycaemic control did not show long-term beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study.24 25Notably, in recent years, specific antidiabetic agents have exhibited promising benefits on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in addition to safe and effective glucose‐lowering effects.26,29Thus, increasing attention has been paid to determining whether there is a protective effect of novel antidiabetic agents on cognitive function. Preliminary evidence has shown that certain novel antidiabetic agents, such as GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors, significantly improved cognitive function in subjects with diabetes, serving as potentially promising candidates against cognitive dysfunction.30,32However, there is still a lack of prospective head-to-head randomised controlled trials to establish the cognitive efficacy of various antidiabetic medications for cognitive dysfunction in diabetes.

Impairment of the olfactory neural circuit is associated with the risk of MCI and accelerated progression from MCI to dementia, and has been considered an early indicator of cognitive decline in T2D.33,35Our previous single-arm study found that GLP-1 RAs treatment for 3 months significantly improved general cognition, olfactory function and increased olfactory brain activation in obese patients with T2D.11Furthermore, a 16-week head-to-head randomised parallel trial demonstrated that GLP-1 RA treatment markedly enhanced the impaired odour-induced left hippocampal activation and improved certain cognitive subdomains, whereas dapagliflozin and acarbose did not. And such cognitive function improvements could be partly ascribed to the direct effects of GLP-1 RAs on olfactory brain activation, as well as to the metabolic ameliorations.21Therefore, the key secondary objectives of LIGHT-MCI investigate the changes in various brain morphometric measures, olfactory brain activation and resting-state functional connectivity, olfactory function, as well as metabolic parameters of the three parallel groups from baseline to 48 weeks and 76 weeks, aiming to shed light on potential mechanisms underlying the cognitive benefits of certain antidiabetic agents.

In conclusion, the LIGHT-MCI trial is poised to provide groundbreaking insights into the comparative effects of various antidiabetic drug classes on achieving MCI remission in patients with T2D. The findings are expected to bridge critical evidence gaps in antidiabetic drug selection for T2D patients with cognitive dysfunction, guiding clinical decision-making and informing future clinical practice guidelines.
