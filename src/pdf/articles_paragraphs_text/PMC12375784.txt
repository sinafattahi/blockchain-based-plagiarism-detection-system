In the literature on high-competition sports, some evidence has been suggested regarding the relationships between athletes’ grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and confidence. However, there has been a lack of integrated approaches to examine the relationships among these variables, and the performance level of athletes have not been considered. Therefore, this study (a) analyzed the structural relationships between grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and confidence, and (b) investigated how these relationships vary according to athletes’ performance levels. Participants were 270 student-athletes (209 males, 61 females) from various sports, all of whom were involved in highly competitive sports in South Korea. Athletes who had won at least one national-level competition were classified into the medal winner group (n= 112), while those without such experience were classified into the non-medal winner group (n= 158). Multi-group analysis showed that the structural relationships among grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and confidence varied according to the athletes’ performance levels. In the medal winner group, self-regulation fully mediated the effect of competition preparation on confidence, whereas in the non-medal winner group, the mediation was partial. Furthermore, the path estimates for self-regulation, competition preparation, and confidence were found to be greater in the medal winner group. This study highlights that coaches should understand athletes’ performance levels and apply appropriate strategies accordingly.

In competitive sports, athletic performance is influenced by a myriad of variables. However, at its core, an athlete’s performance is closely linked to their trust in their own abilities and skills—a concept we commonly refer to as confidence. Vealey1described sports confidence as a multidimensional construct that directly relates to an athlete’s psychological preparation and performance, emphasizing its positive impact on competitive outcomes. In sports, confidence goes beyond mere positive thinking; it provides the mental resilience necessary to effectively manage pressure and stress during competition2. This confidence becomes the driving force that enables athletes to maintain focus in challenging situations and to actively embrace adversity. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that high levels of sports confidence contribute to enhanced performance, rapid recovery and adjustment following failure, and reduced anxiety3–5. Thus, sports confidence is regarded as an essential psychological asset for both successful performance and the long-term development of athletes.

Recognizing the importance of confidence in athletic performance, sports psychologists have explored strategies and factors that bolster pre-competition confidence. Many theories and studies6suggest that the level of confidence an athlete experiences can vary depending on how systematically and effectively they prepare for competitive situations. For instance, many athletes are known to follow personalized pre-competition routines7,8. Moreover, athletes engage in a multifaceted preparation process that encompasses both physical and emotional elements—a process researchers refer to as competition preparation9. Bae et al.10defined competition preparation as a multidimensional construct comprising five aspects. According to them, competition preparation comprehensively involves the management, assessment, and readiness of physical factors (e.g., nutritional management), psychological aspects (e.g., positive self-talk), emotional regulation (e.g., emotion management), environmental influences (e.g., peer relationships), and informational elements (e.g., performance strategy review) to achieve optimal performance in forthcoming competitive situations. Through such preparation, athletes develop strategies to respond flexibly and promptly to various circumstances encountered during competition (e.g., physical condition on the day of competition), which in turn enhances their belief and confidence in their performance.

Vealey6introduced the concept of preparatory confidence, aligned with periodized training, to explain how the process of competition preparation influences performance. Preparatory confidence refers to the belief athletes hold in their ability to succeed during the planning and preparation phases of training6. This belief is fostered by concrete mental training for competition, the planning of various strategies, and the attainment of a physically prepared state. At this stage, athletes focus on learning and habituating responses, plans, and routines tailored to specific competitive situations. This process enhances their generative capabilities11, facilitating the integration of previously acquired skills into specific behavioral patterns that can be executed smoothly during competition. According to Vealey’s11sport confidence model, efforts to develop various sources of confidence—such as technical, psychological, and physical preparation (i.e., competition preparation)—enhance confidence and lead to positive performance outcomes. Therefore, competition preparation serves as a primary source that enables athletes to maintain a positive psychological state and exhibit high levels of confidence during performance.

Researchers have also investigated the factors that facilitate competition preparation, which is closely associated with both performance and confidence12–14. Notably, behaviors in the process of competition preparation extend beyond repetitive training and depend significantly on an individual’s internal control skill. Thus, self-regulation is recognized as a key variable in predicting competition preparation15. Self-regulation refers to the series of processes by which an athlete plans, executes, and evaluates their emotions, thoughts, and actions in pursuit of their goals. The self-regulated learning model16categorizes these processes into planning, execution, and reflection phases. Effective self-regulation aids athletes in systematically carrying out preparation activities and remaining adaptable during competition. Moreover, athletes with strong self-regulatory skills can promptly adjust their strategies when faced with failure or challenges, thereby maintaining optimal performance17. Thus, the behaviors involved in competition preparation are predicted by athletes’ self-regulatory skills, which in turn contribute to qualitative improvements in their preparation.

Empirical evidence further supports the association between athletes’ self-regulation for both competition preparation and confidence. For example, Morri et al.15explored the self-regulation and competition preparation processes through case studies involving a coach and three athletes competing in Canoe Slalom at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They applied the Periodization of Skill Training (PoST) framework as a strategy for Olympic preparation and concluded that promoting self-regulation is crucial for enabling athletes to adapt to dynamic and competitive environments. Furthermore, research by Bae et al.10, which proposed a multidimensional concept of competition preparation, reported significant correlations between competition preparation factors and athletes’ self-management and sports confidence, indicating that self-regulation is indeed linked to both competition preparation and confidence. Additionally, several studies highlight that self-regulation-related variables in sports (e.g., emotion regulation, cognitive regulation) play a crucial role in enhancing confidence18–20. Therefore, an athlete’s self-regulatory skill appears to be a critical prerequisite for both effective competition preparation and the manifestation of confidence.

Meanwhile, recent studies have noted that an athlete’s self-regulatory abilities can be predicted by motivational traits such as grit, which reflect the persistent effort and sustained focus required to achieve long-term goals. Grit is defined as the psychological trait that drives an athlete to invest persistent effort and passion in achieving desired future outcomes—a concept introduced by Duckworth et al.21. However, grit is distinct from mere perseverance; it functions as an intrinsic motivator that facilitates the continuous application of self-regulation strategies22. This trait aids in the consistent management of emotions and behaviors during the self-regulation process, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of an athlete’s self-regulatory efforts. In fact, a meta-analysis by Credé, Tynan, and Harms23synthesized various studies on grit and found a strong correlation between grit and self-control or self-regulation. For instance, the steadfast attitude of not giving up even in the face of challenges shares similar mechanisms with self-regulation, contributing to consistency in goal-directed behavior. Credé et al.23further explained that in sports—where repetitive and structured training is essential—athletes with higher levels of grit tend to employ more systematic and effective self-regulation strategies. This close relationship between grit and self-regulation has also been reported in studies involving Thai national athletes24.

In summary, the motivational trait of grit, which reflects an athlete’s relentless pursuit of long-term goals, is essential for effective self-regulation. In turn, self-regulation not only contributes to thorough competition preparation but also enhances confidence during performance. These interrelationships among the variables are supported by empirical evidence from previous research15,18,23. However, earlier studies have tended to focus on the individual relationships between these variables rather than analyzing the mechanisms or structural interrelationships among them. Therefore, there is a need for research that examines how these four variables interact—including both direct and indirect effects—and the processes underlying these interactions. Moreover, it is worth exploring whether the theoretical structure comprising grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sports confidence differs according to athletes’ background variables. Such research could provide highly meaningful insights for both coaches and athletes in the sports field.

A representative example is that, intuitively, we can infer that the relationships among these four variables may vary depending on an athlete’s ability and performance level25. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that elite athletes—both international and domestic—exhibit higher levels of grit, self-regulation, competition preparation or management skills, and confidence compared to non-elite athletes10,26–28. Furthermore, experience in national competitions is considered a key variable in gauging athletes’ performance. National competitions are extremely important for athletes, especially for youth student-athletes, as the experience of winning medals can significantly influence their psychological, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics. Research indicates that athletes with medal-winning experience have higher levels of self-management as well as superior physical and mental preparation compared to those without such experience29. Notably, the study by Bae et al.10showed that competition preparation factors are positively correlated with self-management and sports confidence factors, and that these competition preparation factors differ according to whether athletes have medaled in national competitions. Consequently, comprehensive research that considers not only the structural relationships among grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sports confidence but also the athletes’ performance levels are required.

In the literature on highly competitive sports, evidence has suggested that athletes’ grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sports confidence are closely interrelated. However, an integrated approach encompassing these variables has been lacking, and previous research has not adequately considered athlete’s performance level. To advance the field and provide useful insights for practitioners, this study aims to (a) analyze the structural relationships among athletes’ grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sports confidence, and (b) examine how these relationships vary according to athletes’ performance levels (i.e., the experience of medaling in national competitions). It is expected that the findings will clarify which variables should be strategically considered to enhance athletes’ confidence and identify the aspects in which elite athletes differ.

Hypothesized research model (H refers to hypothesis).

The participants in this study were 270 Korean student-athletes (aged 16–18) registered with the Korea Olympic Committee. Among them, 209 (77.4%) were male and 61 (22.6%) were female. The average age of the participants was 16.78 years (SD= 0.76). Their athletic experience ranged from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 11 years, with a mean of 6.07 years (SD= 2.27). In terms of sports, taekwondo was the most represented discipline with 69 athletes (25.6%), followed by soccer with 41 athletes (15.2%), judo with 30 athletes (11.1%), track and field with 29 athletes (10.7%), baseball with 26 athletes (9.6%), gymnastics and swimming with 23 athletes each (8.5%), badminton with 15 athletes (5.6%), and table tennis with 14 athletes (5.2%). For multi-group analysis, the participants were divided into two groups: 112 athletes (41.5%) with experience of winning a medal at national competitions (at least placed in the top 3) and 158 athletes (58.5%) without such experience. National competition winning records were determined based on the year in which the data were collected. In this study, athletes with experience in winning a medal at national competitions were classified as themedal winner group, while those without such experience were defined as thenon-medal winner group.

The sport grit scale, developed specifically for Korean athletes30, was utilized in this study. This scale not only addresses the limitations of existing grit measures23but also reflects cultural characteristics by incorporating the unique attributes of Korean athletes into its item development. Sports grit is broadly divided into two dimensions: sports perseverance and sports passion, each comprising three sub-factors. Specifically, the sports perseverance dimension consists of effort and practice (4 items), pursuit of growth and development (4 items), and resilience (5 items), while the sports passion dimension includes goal setting (4 items), focus on task (4 items), and motivation (5 items). Thus, the scale comprises a total of 26 items across six factors, with responses provided on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very much so). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) yielded a model fit of χ²/df(chi-square and degrees of freedom) = 2.717 (χ² = 771.550,df= 284), CFI (Comparative Fit Index) = 0.897, TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index) = 0.882, and RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) = 0.080 (90% CI = 0.074, 0.087), with all factor loadings being statistically significant. To examine whether the items for each measured factor consistently assessed the intended construct (i.e., internal consistency), Cronbach’s α coefficients were calculated. A value of 0.70 or higher was considered indicative of acceptable internal consistency31. Cronbach’s alpha produced coefficients of 0.833 for effort and practice, 0.830 for pursuit of growth and development, 0.890 for resilience, 0.852 for goal setting, 0.771 for focus on task, and 0.845 for motivation.

The Korean version of the Self-Regulation of Learning Self-Report Scale (SRL-SRS), originally developed by Toering et al.32, was employed in this study33. This scale measures the extent to which athletes efficiently control and regulate themselves during competition, with higher scores indicating superior self-regulatory abilities. It consists of six sub-factors: planning (5 items), self-monitoring (5 items), evaluation (5 items), reflection (5 items), effort (5 items), and self-efficacy (4 items), totalling 29 items. All items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1: not at all, 5: very much so). CFA demonstrated a model fit of χ²/df= 2.164 (χ² = 783.437,df= 362), CFI = 0.932, TLI = 0.924, and RMSEA = 0.066 (90% CI = 0.059, 0.072), with all factor loadings being statistically significant. Subsequent reliability analysis using Cronbach’s alpha yielded coefficients of 0.869 for planning, 0.871 for self-monitoring, 0.900 for evaluation, 0.888 for reflection, 0.919 for effort, and 0.908 for self-efficacy. Therefore, all reliability coefficients were found to be acceptable.

Competition preparation was measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of Preparation for Sport Competition (MAPSC)10, which was developed specifically for Korean athletes. This instrument assesses the preparation of athletes in five dimensions—physical, psychological, emotional, environmental, and informational—in the lead-up to competitions. Specifically, it consists of 25 items across five factors: physical preparation (5 items), psychological preparation (5 items), emotional preparation (5 items), environmental preparation (5 items), and informational preparation (5 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very much so). CFA yielded a model fit of χ²/df= 2.252 (χ² = 596.742,df= 265), CFI = 0.899, TLI = 0.886, and RMSEA = 0.068 (90% CI = 0.061, 0.076), with all factor loadings being statistically significant. Subsequent reliability analysis using Cronbach’s alpha produced coefficients of 0.797 for psychological preparation, 0.824 for physical preparation, 0.791 for emotional preparation, 0.889 for environmental preparation, and 0.811 for informational preparation. Therefore, all reliability coefficients were found to be acceptable.

Sports confidence was measured using the Korean version34of the instrument originally developed by Vealey et al.11. This measure has been widely employed in various studies over an extended period, and its validity and reliability as an instrument for assessing athletes’ confidence have been well established. The Korean version comprises four factors: ability (4 items), coach’s leadership (4 items), physical/mental preparation (4 items), and social support (4 items), totalling 16 items. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very much so). CFA yielded a model fit of χ²/df= 2.561 (χ² = 250.940,df= 98), CFI = 0.946, TLI = 0.934, and RMSEA = 0.076 (90% CI = 0.065, 0.088), with all factor loadings being statistically significant. Subsequent reliability analysis using Cronbach’s alpha resulted in coefficients of 0.875 for ability, 0.885 for coach’s leadership, 0.870 for physical/mental preparation, and 0.762 for social support. Therefore, all reliability coefficients were found to be acceptable.

This study was conducted with the approval of the university’s Institutional Review Board (WS-2025-04). A non-probability sampling method was used to recruit participants, who were student-athletes belonging to high school sports teams. After initial consultations with each high school, the research team directly contacted team staff (e.g., head coaches or assistant coaches) to seek cooperation for data collection. For teams that agreed to participate, official documents and consent forms were individually sent to the athletes’ legal guardians (e.g., parents) to obtain parental consent. Once parental consent was secured, athletes were sent a link via mobile devices containing an informed consent form and the survey questionnaire. In accordance with research ethics, participants were informed about the anonymity of the survey, the right to access data, the intended use of the collected data, and the voluntary nature of participation. Athletes completed the online questionnaire through the provided link, and the submitted responses were automatically recorded. The researchers then downloaded the recorded data in bulk for analysis.

The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 24.0, both provided by IBM. The research followed a sequential analytical process. First, the mean and standard deviation were calculated to examine the basic trends in the data. Normality was assessed by checking skewness and kurtosis values, where normality was assumed if the absolute value of skewness was ≤ 2 and kurtosis was ≤ 735. Next, bivariate correlation coefficients were calculated to explore the relationships among the sub-factors of the study variables, using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r). Multicollinearity issues were examined by ensuring that the correlation coefficient did not exceed the threshold (r<.80).

The research hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Model fit indices included χ² anddf, CFI, TLI, and RMSEA. The model was considered a “good fit” if χ²/dfwas less than 3, CFI and TLI were greater than 0.90, and RMSEA was less than 0.0835. Indirect effects were tested using bootstrapping with 2,000 resamples and a 95% confidence interval. To verify individual indirect effect paths within the structural model, the phantom model technique was applied. This method introduces hypothetical latent variables to test the difference or combination of indirect effects without directly connecting them to observed variables, reflecting theoretically existing effects within the model36.

Finally, a multi-group analysis was conducted to examine whether differences existed in the research model based on athletes’ national competition experience. Sequential analyses were performed for configural invariance, metric invariance, and structural invariance models. Model comparisons and selections followed the same fit indices as the structural model (χ²/df, CFI, TLI, RMSEA). However, since the chi-square test is sensitive to sample size, strict adherence to its results was avoided37. In addition to conventional fit indices such as CFI and RMSEA, we also interpreted the model fit using the 90% confidence interval of RMSEA as an inferential approach (i.e., equivalence testing) to evaluate the adequacy of the model38,39. The Wald test was used to check the statistical significance of group differences in indirect effects40.

Table1presents the descriptive statistics and results of the bivariate correlation analysis for the study variables. As shown in the table, the means of the variables ranged from 3.703 to 4.323, and the standard deviations ranged from 0.588 to 0.786. The kurtosis values ranged from − 0.729 to − 0.162, and the skewness values ranged from − 0.995 to 0.347. These results indicate that the data meet the assumption of normality. Regarding correlations, all variables were found to have significant correlations at the 𝑝 < 0.01 level. Specifically, all sub-factors of grit showed positive correlations with self-management, sports confidence, and competition preparation factors. Similarly, all sub-factors of self-management showed positive correlations with sports confidence and competition preparation factors, while sports confidence factors also exhibited positive correlations with competition preparation factors. These results suggest that grit, self-management, sports confidence, and competition preparation are positively related to each other. Meanwhile, among the sub-factors of grit, the correlation between task focus and motivation was relatively high atr=.805. However, since this value does not indicate an extreme level of multicollinearity, it was deemed acceptable35.

A SEM analysis was conducted for the entire sample without distinguishing between groups. The results indicated that the model fit indices were as follows: χ²/df= 2.871 (χ² = 531.215,df= 185), CFI = 0.931, TLI = 0.922, and RMSEA = 0.083 (90% CI = 0.075, 0.092). Considering the overall fit indices, the research model demonstrated a “good fit”35. Table2presents the results of the structural model verification for the relationships among latent variables. The analysis showed that athletes’ grit had a positive effect on self-regulation (β= 0.935, 𝑝 < 0.001). Additionally, self-regulation had a significant positive effect on competition preparation (β= 0.832, 𝑝 < 0.001) and sports confidence (β= 0.251, 𝑝 < 0.05). Furthermore, competition preparation was significantly related to sports confidence (β= 0.603, 𝑝 < 0.001). Moreover, grit indirectly influenced competition preparation (B = 0.607, 𝑝 < 0.01) and sports confidence (B = 0.430, 𝑝 < 0.001) through the mediating effect of self-regulation.

To examine whether the previously analyzed research model differed according to athletes’ national competition award experience, a multi-group analysis was conducted. The results are presented in Table3. First, the model fit indices for the configural invariance model were χ² = 770.553,df= 370 (χ²/df= 2.083), CFI = 0.923, TLI = 0.911, and RMSEA = 0.064 (90% CI = 0.057, 0.070), indicating an acceptable fit, thus establishing configural invariance. Next, for the metric invariance model, which imposes constraints on the factor loadings of the latent variables, the results showed Δχ² = 23.556 and Δdf= 17, which were not statistically significant (p>.05). Therefore, full metric invariance was confirmed.

Note. χ² = chi-square;df= degrees of freedom; Δχ² = chi-square difference; Δdf = difference in degrees of freedom;p= probability value; CFI = Comparative Fit Index; TLI = Tucker–Lewis Index; RMSEA = Root Mean Square Error of Approximation; CI = Confidence Interval.

Subsequently, a structural invariance model was tested to determine whether the model paths differed between groups based on national competition award experience. The fit indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA) did not deteriorate compared to the metric invariance model, and the results showed Δχ² = 46.998 and Δdf= 21, which were statistically significant. Therefore, structural invariance was established. To further explore which specific paths showed significant group differences, a partial structural invariance model was tested by constraining each path individually. The results revealed that two paths were statistically significant: self-regulation → competition preparation and competition preparation → confidence. This indicates that the effects of self-regulation on competition preparation and competition preparation on confidence varied depending on athletes’ performance levels.

The path estimates for the partial structural invariance model are presented in Table4; Fig.2. As shown in the table, the path coefficients differed in some aspects between the medal winner and non-medal winner groups. First, the effect of grit on self-regulation was statistically significant in both the medal winner group (β= 0.966, 𝑝 < 0.001) and the non-medal winner group (β= 0.908, 𝑝 < 0.001), with no significant difference between the groups. Second, the effect of self-regulation on competition preparation was significant for both the medal winner group (β= 0.910, 𝑝 < 0.05) and the non-medal winner group (β= 0.777, 𝑝 < 0.001), with a statistically significant difference between the groups. Third, the effect of self-regulation on sports confidence was not significant in the medal winner group (β= 0.102, 𝑝 > 0.05), but it was significant in the non-medal winner group (β= 0.505, 𝑝 < 0.001), although the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Fourth, the effect of competition preparation on sports confidence was significant for both the medal winner group (β= 0.840, 𝑝 < 0.001) and the non-medal winner group (β= 0.417, 𝑝 < 0.001), with a significant difference between the groups.

To test group differences in indirect effects, bootstrapping was applied to the metric invariance model without path constraints. The analysis of three indirect pathways showed the following results: Grit → Self-regulation → Competition preparation was statistically significant for both the medal winner group (B = 0.757, 𝑝 < 0.01, [0.640, 0.874]) and the non-medal winner group (B = 0.512, 𝑝 < 0.01, [0.390, 0.633]). Grit → Self-regulation → Sports confidence was significant only in the non-medal winner group (B = 0.381, 𝑝 < 0.01, [−0.760, 0.500]), while the indirect effect was not significant in the medal winner group (B = 0.084, 𝑝 > 0.05, [0.182, 0.569]). Grit → Self-regulation → Competition preparation → Sports confidence was significant for both the medal winner group (B = 0.730, 𝑝 < 0.01, [0.361, 1.634]) and the non-medal winner group (B = 0.234, 𝑝 < 0.01, [0.097, 0.433]). The Wald test results indicated a significant group difference in the Grit → Self-regulation → Competition preparation path (Wald’s Z = 8.06, 𝑝 < 0.01). This suggests that there is a significant difference in the strength of the indirect effect of grit on competition preparation via self-regulation between the medal winner and non-medal winner groups, suggesting that the effect operates differently across performance levels.

The present study examined the structural relationships among athletes’ grit, self-regulation, and competition preparation, and how these relationships differ according to performance level. To briefly revisit the hypotheses, we predicted that grit would positively influence self-regulation, which in turn would predict higher levels of competition preparation. Additionally, we hypothesized that these relationships would vary across medal winner and non-medal winner groups. The results generally supported these hypotheses. Grit was found to significantly predict self-regulation, which subsequently predicted athletes’ preparation for competition. Furthermore, multi-group analysis revealed that the strength of these paths varied depending on athletes’ medal acquisition, suggesting meaningful differences in how psychological traits contribute to competition readiness in different groups. These findings support Vealey’s6concept of preparation-based confidence, which suggest that athletes’ confidence is shaped by their physical and psychological preparation. This study highlights that competition preparation boosts sports confidence and aligns with previous research showing that athletes’ efforts to control themselves promote competition preparation15and that such self-regulation stems from long-term goal-oriented motivation23.

Based on these findings, we can understand the role and mechanisms of grit, self-regulation, and competition preparation in the formation of athletes’ sports confidence. Grit involves a strong intrinsic motivation to achieve future goals, and the stronger this motivation, the more likely athletes are to continuously develop their abilities and take action41. This increased motivation triggers systematic self-regulation strategies and behaviors, positively impacting pre-competition preparation. Zimmerman’s self-regulated learning model42explains that goal setting, self-observation, self-evaluation, and feedback acceptance are key to learning and performance, suggesting that athletes prepare for future performances and competitions by setting goals, practicing self-monitoring, and evaluating themselves. In this way, athletes’ intrinsic motivation (i.e., grit) and self-regulation skills lead to systematic planning and execution, ultimately enhancing performance-related confidence. Such psychological mechanisms can help coaching staff and trainers develop tailored training and psychological support programs to strengthen athletes’ motivation. Managing psychological resources systematically during pre-competition preparation can also help athletes effectively mitigate negative factors like anxiety and stress, ensuring stable performance during actual competitions11.

Beyond the overall structural relationships, this study sought to understand whether these relationships differ by performance level. The multigroup analysis revealed significant differences in some relationships across medal winners and non-medal winners, supporting previous research findings10,26–28. More importantly, this study extends prior research by revealing structural differences in the relationships among the four variables based on performance level. The multigroup analysis provided two critical insights: (1) differences in the paths themselves and (2) differences in path effect sizes between performance groups.

First, the analysis showed that some relationships among the variables differed depending on performance level. For medal winners, self-regulation did not directly predict sports confidence; instead, it influenced confidence only through competition preparation (i.e., complete mediation). In contrast, for non-medal winners, self-regulation directly predicted sports confidence and indirectly influenced it through competition preparation (i.e., partial mediation). Interpreting this difference, it appears that self-regulation is essential for non-medal winners to enhance their confidence, while medal winners may not rely on self-regulation as a direct predictor of confidence. Instead, self-regulation enhances their competition preparation, which in turn boosts confidence. This discrepancy may stem from differences in achievement experiences between the two groups6. Medal winners generally possess more successful experiences than non-medalists, which may lead to a higher baseline of internalized confidence. Consequently, self-regulation may have a limited direct effect on their confidence. However, self-regulation still plays a vital indirect role by facilitating more effective competition preparation, which, in turn, enhances and stabilizes sport confidence during high-stakes competitions. Conversely, non-medal winners, with fewer successful experiences, may rely more on self-regulation to build confidence43. Thus, coaches may need to adopt different strategies based on athletes’ performance levels: for medal winners, refining pre-competition preparation processes (e.g., periodization principles) may be more critical, whereas for non-medal winners, enhancing self-regulation skills (e.g., self-monitoring) may be a key focus.

The second major finding from the multigroup analysis was that the magnitude of certain path effects differed by performance level. Specifically, the direct and indirect effects of self-regulation → competition preparation, competition preparation → sports confidence, and grit → self-regulation → competition preparation were statistically stronger for medal winners than for non-medal winners. This suggests that medal winning athletes are more effective at using long-term goal motivation to enhance self-regulation and prepare for upcoming competitions. Moreover, their self-regulation skills strongly influence competition preparation, which plays a larger role in boosting sports confidence. This interpretation aligns with the earlier finding that competition preparation is a critical differentiating factor between the two groups.

Notably, given that self-regulation has a greater impact on competition preparation and that competition preparation more strongly influences sports confidence in medal winners, the key distinguishing factor appears to be the multidimensional aspect of competition preparation. This preparation extends beyond simple skill practice or physiological preparation to encompass psychological and emotional preparation, which are essential for fostering sport confidence10. Such thorough preparation helps athletes respond flexibly to unexpected situations during competitions and instills a sense of assurance that they have done everything possible to succeed6. Ultimately, this heightened sports confidence drives superior performance. Therefore, considering the characteristics of medal winners, coaches working with non-medal winners should guide them to develop self-regulation skills that enable effective competition preparation, thereby fostering confidence and improving performance outcomes.

This study revealed that the structural relationships among grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sport confidence differ depending on athletes’ performance levels. These findings emphasize the importance of developing context-specific psychological training strategies, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. Among medal winners, self-regulation indirectly influenced sport confidence through improved competition preparation, whereas among non-medal winners, self-regulation had a direct effect on sport confidence. This distinction provides empirical evidence that psychological skills function differently across performance levels, highlighting the need for differentiated intervention programs.

Coaches, sport psychologists, and athlete support personnel can apply these findings by implementing practical strategies tailored to athlete readiness and skill level. For athletes with a medal winning background, advanced self-regulation techniques—such as attentional control, arousal regulation, and cognitive restructuring—can be integrated into competition preparation routines. While self-regulation may not directly increase their sport confidence, these techniques help fine-tune preparation strategies, promote a sense of readiness, and contribute indirectly to maintaining confidence under competitive pressure. On the other hand, non-medal athletes would benefit from training that strengthens basic self-regulatory capacities, such as self-awareness, goal-directed behavior, and emotional monitoring, which can serve as foundational skills for developing grit and confidence over time.

In addition, grit training can be operationalized by encouraging athletes to set clear long-term goals, reflect on progress, and develop personal strategies to sustain effort in the face of adversity. Coaches and sport psychologists can support this process by integrating self-motivation routines, personalized feedback cycles, and reinforcement techniques that cultivate perseverance. Ultimately, this study offers concrete guidance for designing mental training programs that align with athletes’ current developmental needs, enhancing both the efficacy and applicability of psychological support in competitive sports.

This study provided a comprehensive understanding of grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sports confidence based on athletes’ performance levels. Although meaningful findings were derived, there are still limitations that future research should address. For instance, this study was conducted with Korean athletes, so future research should include athletes from other countries to account for cultural differences. While the competitive aspect of sports may not show significant cultural variation, the process of preparing for competition and athletes’ motivational factors may differ. Additionally, this study classified athletes into medal winner and non-medal winner groups based on their experience of winning or not winning national competitions. Future research could include athletes with national team experience or those who have competed in international events. Although some participants in this study (14 athletes) had experience winning international competitions, they were included in the medal winner group due to sample size limitations for statistical analysis. Furthermore, future research should explore additional variables that can distinguish athletes’ performance levels. For sports like shooting, archery, swimming, or golf, performance records could serve as objective criteria to classify medal winner and non-medal winner groups.

Another limitation of this study is that we did not consider the potential moderating effect of age. Since the participants were adolescent athletes, differences in age may reflect variations in sport experience and psychological development. It is plausible that older athletes, regardless of medal achievement, might demonstrate higher levels of grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sport confidence. Future research should examine whether age serves as a moderator in the relationship among these psychological variables. In addition, the sample included a higher proportion of male athletes, which may introduce a sex bias. Although the current analysis did not investigate the potential moderating or mediating role of sex, future research should consider whether sex differences influence the development and expression of key psychological variables in youth sport.

This study contributed to expanding existing theories and previous research by analyzing how the structural relationships among grit, self-regulation, competition preparation, and sports confidence vary depending on athletes’ performance levels. The model demonstrated a good fit for the overall group, showing that grit positively influenced self-regulation, and self-regulation directly and indirectly predicted competition preparation and sports confidence. Furthermore, the multi-group analysis revealed significant differences in pathways and effect sizes between medal winners and non-medal winners. These findings not only highlight the critical role of long-term goal motivation, self-regulation abilities, and competition preparation in shaping sports confidence but also emphasize that these dynamics differ according to performance levels. Therefore, coaches should understand athletes’ performance levels and apply appropriate strategies accordingly. For medal winners, refining the competition preparation process through self-regulation (e.g., competition preparation based on periodization principles) may be beneficial. In contrast, for non-medal winners, strategies aimed at improving self-regulation (e.g., self-monitoring) may be more effective.
