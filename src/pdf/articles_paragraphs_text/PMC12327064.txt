Biosurfactants are increasingly recognized for their versatile applications across industries, including bioremediation and pharmaceuticals. Among these, lipopeptides, produced notably byBacillusspecies, demonstrate promising surface activity and biocompatibility. This study investigates the toxicity of lipopeptides biosurfactants derived from the AF_3B strain ofBacillus velezensis. The research delves into the production of lipopeptides biosurfactants from AF_3B and their characterization through antibacterial bioassays, revealing a significant inhibition of various bacterial strains. In vitro assays demonstrate the ability of lipopeptides biosurfactants to suppress the growth of key mycotoxigenic fungi (Aspergillus nigerandFusarium oxysporum) maximum to 86%, confirming their potential as a biological control. In ovo toxicity is assessed by injecting fertile chicken embryos with varying doses (30, 15, 7.5, 3.75, and 1.87 mg/mL) of lipopeptides biosurfactants obtained from AF_3B. The embryos exhibit normal development and high survival rates, indicating negligible toxicity. Overall, this study highlightsB. velezensisstrain AF_3B as a valuable candidate against bacterial and fungal diseases and foodborne pathogens, and in healthcare sector, underscoring the potential of lipopeptides biosurfactants in diverse industrial applications.

Toxicity is a matter of concern when accessing any product obtained from any source. Therefore, toxicity testing is crucial for assessing the safety of a wide range of substances, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer products (Kruger and Mann2003). The process involves assessing any potential negative effects that these compounds may have on living organisms, including people, animals and the environment (Damalas and Eleftherohorinos2011). Toxicology testing's primary goals are to identify and classify any negative effects, pinpoint the exposure threshold at which these effects occur and assess the overall risk associated with the substance (Dusinska et al.2017). Toxicity testing can be performed in both in vitro and in vivo models. There is an increasing incline to use organic lipopeptide biosurfactants to chemically produce one. Therefore, the safety and toxicity of these organic compounds need to be determined.

Bacillus velezensisis a gram‐positive spore‐forming bacterium that can exist alone, in pairs, occasionally in short chains, or in any combination of these (Ruiz‐García et al.2005). They are motile and on LB media, the colonies appear to be creamy white (Ruiz‐García et al.2005).Bacillusfrequently possess the ability to produce endospores, which enables them to endure a variety of environmental challenges and difficult circumstances, such as extremely high or low temperatures, radiation, starvation and disinfectants (Setlow2006). It is said to produce lipopeptide biosurfactants which are classified as organic compounds.

Organic substances, known as secondary metabolites, are primarily produced by fungi, bacteria and plants (Collemare et al.2020). They have numerous applications in various fields, for instance in medicines, agriculture and industry (Soberón‐Chávez and Maier2011). They are used as enzyme inhibitors, immunosuppressive agents, anti‐migraine agents, antitumor agents, hypocholesterolemic agents and antiparasitic agents (Demain1999). Moreover, they are also used as drugs, fragrance and flavours (Verpoorte et al.2002). The main industrial applications of biosurfactants included oil recovery/processing, cosmetics and detergents (Gharaei‐Fa2011).

There is a huge demand of bio‐surfactants (Théatre et al.2021). Due to their significant antibacterial properties against a variety of diseases, they can replace synthetic surfactants and lower the essential micelle concentration and surface tension of water (Zhao et al.2017). It is observed that lipopeptides are regarded as bio‐surfactants as they have the same effect as chemical surfactants in reducing surface and interfacial tensions (Mukherjee et al.2006). Lipopeptides are amphiphilic in nature having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. The hydrophilic moiety is the peptide ring (cyclic structure) consisting of hydrophobic fatty acid chain connected to 7–10 amino acids.Bacillusspecies produce three main classes of lipopeptides which include surfactin, iturin and fengycin (Smyth et al.2010). Many scientific investigations have delved into surface‐active molecules as potential agents for promoting wound healing, as they are known to possess anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial properties (Ohadi et al.2023). Biosurfactants sourced from microbes have been identified in numerous research areas, such as cancer treatment support, enhancing drug delivery systems, promoting better oral hygiene, combating biofilm formation, aiding in feed digestion, controlling pathogens, accelerating wound healing, assisting in dermatological therapies and exhibiting antimicrobial properties (Alara et al.2023; Ben Ayed et al.2015).

Biosurfactants exhibit strong antibacterial, antiviral and anti‐fungal activities, thus making them beneficial for treating many diseases (Md2012). In 2017, a study conducted by Ohadi et al. (2017) significantly proved that lipopeptide biosurfactants promotes wound healing due to its significant antioxidant capacity. Due to their abilities to emulsify, moisten, foam, distribute and bind water, biosurfactants are set to replace chemically produced surfactants (Md2012). Around the globe, the chemical and synthetic substances are a matter of great concern as they are contributing toward the increasing environmental hazards. More importance is given to natural products synthesized by living organisms to protect the environment. Biosurfactants have become popular in sanitizers, especially since the COVID‐19 pandemic (Subramaniam et al.2020). Chemical biosurfactants have been found to cause skin damage, whereas organic biosurfactants are considered safer for use (Thapliyal and Negi2023). Moreover, biosurfactants are said to play an important role in anti‐ageing (Aziz et al.2021; Vecino et al.2017).

Lipopeptides produced byB. velezensishave antibacterial and antifungal activity (Fazle Rabbee and Baek2020). It has been shown that lipopeptides directly affect fungi by preventing the growth of filamentous fungal hyphae, germ tubes and spores (Li et al.2021). The major mycotoxigenic fungus has recently been the subject of numerous studies looking at lipopeptides’ effects (Penha et al.2020; Kaur et al.2017). Along with this, due to immense antibacterial activity, there is an increasing development in using lipopeptide biosurfactants in healthcare sector particularly wound healing (Ohadi et al.2023). However, further research is needed to address the challenges related to productivity and higher production costs of biosurfactants. Overcoming these drawbacks will facilitate the commercialization of biosurfactants, making them a competitive alternative to chemical surfactants in the market.

In the current study, AF_3B was examined for its capacity to produce various lipopeptides biosurfactants and to suppress the presence of some of the principal mycotoxigenic fungi in vitro as well as the impact of biosurfactants (at different doses for 24 and 96 h) on the size and aspect of chicken embryos in ovo. In vitro study was done to determine the antifungal potential of biosurfactant, and in ovo study was done to determine the toxicity so that the produced lipopeptide biosurfactants can be further processed for in vitro analysis so that it can be further formulated to make antibacterial cream for wound healing and can also be taken to skincare especially cleansing and anti‐ageing products.

B. velezensisAF_3B was preserved in glycerol stocks at −80°C freezer. Frozen strain was streaked on LB (Luria‐Bertani) agar plate and then incubated overnight at 37°C. Pre‐culture solution was prepared by cultivating a colony of it to 10 mL of sterile LB broth (Gerhardt1994; Russell and Sambrook2001) (10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L Tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract), incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm.

For the optimum production of lipopeptides biosurfactant, media with different compositions were tested. Minimal salt media with different compositions were tested (theSupporting Informationsection).

A production media totalling 2.5 L was meticulously prepared for the experiment. This volume was distributed across four 1‐L flasks, with each flask receiving 500 mL, and two 500‐mL flasks, each filled with 250 mL. Subsequently, the media in all flasks underwent sterilization via autoclaving at 121°C and 15 lb per square inch (psi) pressure for a duration of 15 min. Upon completion of the sterilization process, 5 mL of inoculum were introduced into each of the 1‐L flasks, whereas 2.5 mL of inoculum were added to each of the 500‐mL flasks. Following inoculation, all flasks were subjected to incubation for a period of 5 days at a controlled temperature of 30°C and 180 rpm.

To obtain the cell‐free supernatant, 35 mL of the culture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was discarded. Subsequently, the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 2, and it was then stored at 4°C overnight.

Centrifuged the mixture again, but this time discarded the supernatant and stored the resulting pellet at −20°C.

In order to obtain the lipopeptides biosurfactant in powder form, it was subjected to lyophilization. The samples in falcon tubes were positioned at the nozzles of the lyophilizer until powder consistency was achieved.

The agar well diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial properties of the bacterial strains. LB agar medium was prepared, and 25 mL was poured into Petri plates. A three‐fold dilution of AF_3B was prepared, and 40 µL of each test culture was spread onto the LB agar plates. Wells of 3–4 mm were created in the agar plates using pipette tips, and approximately 250 µL of supernatant from each bioactive isolate was added into these wells. The plates were then incubated at 30°C for 24–48 h to evaluate the antibacterial activities. The presence of clear zones indicated the antibacterial activities, and the diameter of the zones of inhibition was measured in mm. The experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the mean values of the zone of inhibitions ±SD were calculated using one way ANOVA by Minitab software.

Aspergillus niger(accession number# ATCC16404) andFusarium oxysporum(accession number# ATCC76255) from fungal collection of the Industrial Biotechnology Division, NIBGE were used in this study. These fungal strains were inoculated in the centre of Petri dishes filled with potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maheshwari et al.1999; Sharma and Pandey2010) and placed in an incubator at a temperature of 25°C for a duration of 7 days (Leslie and Summerell2008).

A 100‐mL pre‐culture of strain AF_3B was introduced into a 1000‐mL volume of potato dextrose broth, with concentrations of potatoes at 200 g/L and dextrose at 20 g/L. Subsequently, the mixture underwent incubation at a controlled temperature of 25°C for a period of 3 weeks, preceding its utilization in in vitro experiments aimed at evaluating its efficacy in inhibiting fungal proliferation. Preceding and following filtration through a sterile 0.20‐µm filter, the solution underwent processing to yield a cell‐free broth.

To assess the effects of both the raw and cell‐free broths, 1 mL of the solution was carefully applied onto Petri dishes filled with PDA (Maheshwari et al.1999; Sharma and Pandey2010) medium. A sterile spatula was used to spread the solution evenly across the surface of the medium, ensuring thorough coverage. Sterile agar discs with a diameter of 2 mm were prepared in the centre by using 1‐mL tip. Similarly, using a sterile 1‐mL tip, agar discs with a diameter of 2 mm were meticulously extracted from the centre of a mycotoxigenic fungal colony. These agar discs, free from any contaminants, were then positioned at the central area of the Petri dish having both the raw and cell‐free broths. Great care was taken to ensure the precise placement and alignment of the agar discs, thereby guaranteeing an accurate evaluation of their impact on the surrounding medium. For comparison purposes, Petri dishes without the addition of bacterial broths were included as control groups for the two fungal strains. These control dishes were used to assess the baseline growth and behaviour of the fungal strains in the absence of any treatment or intervention. Subsequently, the Petri dishes were placed in an incubator, set at a temperature of 25°C for a duration of 14 days. After the incubation period, the extent of fungal growth was assessed and recorded. The experiment was performed in triplicate, ensuring reproducibility and reliability of the results. The diameter of the fungal colonies was measured as a means of quantifying the extent of growth. The percentage of reduction in fungal growth was determined by comparing the diameters of fungal colonies obtained in the untreated Petri dishes (without the bacterial broths) with those obtained in the presence of the bacterial broths. The reduction percentage was calculated as the difference in growth diameters between the two conditions divided by the growth diameter in the untreated dishes, multiplied by 100 (Bertuzzi et al.2022).

Pure cultures ofA. nigerandF. oxysporumwere prepared on appropriate agar media. The cultures were ensured to be actively growing and free from contamination. A sterile technique was used to transfer a colony of each fungus into separate flasks containing PDB using a sterilized spatula. Bacterial solution prepared above was used. A volume of 2.5 mL of the bacterial solution was added to each flask containing the fungus, except for the negative control. All the flasks were placed in a shaking incubator set to 25°C for 7 days at 180 rpm. Proper aseptic conditions were maintained throughout the incubation period to prevent contamination. The flasks were not disturbed during incubation to ensure consistent growth conditions. The growth of the fungi was regularly monitored by visual observation. Visible differences in growth between the negative control and the treated samples were noted. After 7 days of incubation, samples were collected from each flask, including the negative control. Slides were prepared by carefully transferring a small amount of each sample onto glass slides. Cover slip was added, and a drop of emulsion oil was added. The samples were then examined under phase contrast microscopy to observe the structural differences in hyphae and spore formation. The process was done in triplicate.

Solutions containing biosurfactants at concentrations of 30, 15, 7.5, 3.75, and 1.87 mg/mL were prepared by reconstituting freeze‐dried biosurfactants in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) (Behzadnia et al.2022). The lipopeptide biosurfactants, produced by AF_3B, were utilized in five different dose concentration.

Zero‐day‐old chicken embryonated eggs of Ross breed were acquired from a reputable hatchery known as SB‐Hatcheries Okara, Pakistan. A total of 84 embryonated eggs were used in this study that were further divided into 3 distinct groups, denoted as Group A (Untreated) containing 12 embryonated eggs that comprised 2 subgroups, each consisting of 6 eggs; Group B (PBS) that also consisted of 12 embryonated eggs, including 2 subgroups, as well, each consisting of 6 eggs; and Group C [lipopeptide biosurfactant (produced by AF_3B)] which consisted of 60 eggs that were distributed into 5 subgroups, each containing 12 eggs. All subgroups of Group C were treated with five different dose concentrations of lipopeptide bio‐surfactant. A detailed breakdown of each group is provided in Table1. The candling method was used to identify and remove defective or unfertilized eggs. The precise position of the air cell was marked on the egg shell using a pencil. Subsequently, the eggs underwent a thorough cleaning with a solution of 70% alcohol. A small hole was meticulously created at the air cell boundary of each egg using a sterile thumb pin. Finally, a sterilized insulin syringe was horizontally inserted into the eggs for administration purposes. A volume of 100 µL from each of five different dose concentrations in mg/mL (30AF,15AF, 7.5AF, 3.75AF and1.87AF) of lipopetide biosurfactant was carefully injected into the allantoic cavities of 12 eggs of each subgroup being respectively present in Group C at Day 9 of incubation of embryonated eggs along with 12 eggs of each from Groups A and B. The injected eggs were placed in a controlled environment with high humidity that was maintained at 55%–60% and incubated at a temperature of 37°C for a period of 24 h, and six eggs each from Groups (A and B) and each from subgroups of Group C were opened aseptically. Size and appearance of the embryos were recorded. Similarly, next sampling of remaining six eggs from each group and subgroups was done after 96 h of treatment. All the set conditions were carefully monitored and following the incubation period, the size and visual characteristics of each chicken embryo were carefully observed and documented. The appearance, including any abnormalities or developmental changes, was noted as part of the evaluation process. The data were recorded in multiple times for each treatment and control groups, and the mean values of the weight and (crown‐rump length) CRL ± SD were calculated using one way ANOVA with the help of Minitab software. Moreover, the heart and liver of these were sent for histopathology to examine any abnormality.

Histopathology was conducted on selected organs, including the liver and intestines, using the standard method described by Bancroft and Gamble (2008). The organs were preserved in 10% formalin for 15 days for tissue hardening, with 10% buffered formalin used. Dehydration involved placing the tissues in various alcohol concentrations, followed by clearing with xylene to remove alcohol. Infiltration and embedding were achieved by placing the tissues in Paraffin I and Paraffin II at 61°C, using plastic and steel molds. Sectioning was performed using a microtome, followed by mounting the sections on glass slides with Meyer's egg albumin as the mounting medium. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was subsequently performed.

The secondary metabolites production ofB. velezensiswas checked in three different media (minimal salt medium). After 120 h of incubation in shaking incubator, the third minimal salt medium showed maximum production and trace element solution played a vital role in it.

In order to obtain the lipopeptides biosurfactant in powder form, the growth ofBacillus velezensisstrains AF_3B was subjected to lyophilization and crude powder was obtained (Figure1).On the basis of antagonistic potential of AF_3B powder was mixed in autoclaved distilled water. The culture mixtures were tested for antibacterial activities by agar well diffusion method. The AF_3B showed promising results by inhibiting the growth of all tested Gram positive and Gram‐negative bacterial strains. The diameters of zone of inhibitions were also measure and given in Table2.

The growth of mycotoxigenic fungi was investigated through in vitro experiments using both raw bacterial broth and cell‐free bacterial broth. The raw bacterial broth contained live and active bacterial cells, whereas the cell‐free broth was devoid of any bacterial cells and consisted of the metabolites produced by the bacteria. The utilization of rawBacillusbroth, containing viable bacterial cells, significantly inhibited the growth of the tested mycotoxigenic fungi. The presence of bacterial cells was found to be integral in the inhibition of fungi, attributed to their activities and interactions. This interaction demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect on the fungi. On the contrary, in the utilization of the cell‐free broth, deliberate extraction of bacterial cells occurred, thereby exclusively retaining the secondary metabolites generated by the bacteria. Unexpectedly, even in the absence of bacterial cells, the cell‐free broth demonstrated inhibitory effects on fungal growth. This observation implies that the composition of bacterial metabolites within the broth significantly contributed to restraining fungal proliferation.

Among the tested mycotoxigenic fungi,A. nigerexhibited the most significant growth reduction when exposed to both the raw and cell‐free broth. The inhibition was nearly complete, underscoring the high efficacy of the metabolites present in the broth in suppressing the growth of this particular fungus. Encouragingly, similar promising outcomes were also observed againstF. oxysporum. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of both live bacterial cells and their metabolites in inhibiting the growth of mycotoxigenic fungi. The rawBacillusbroth containing active bacterial cells demonstrated robust inhibitory effects, whereas the cell‐free broth highlighted the influence of bacterial metabolites on fungal growth as shown in Figures2,3, with growth reduction data in Table3.

A distinct contrast in flask colour was observed (Figure4). The patterns of growth for bothA. nigerandF. oxysporumwere visualized using a phase‐contrast microscope. Notably, fungal growth was evident in the control group. In the case ofF. oxysporum, hyphae were observed, appearing entangled with each other, displaying a clear growth pattern (Figure5). However, in the experimental group treated with theBacillussolution alongside the fungus, growth was inhibited. Bacterial activity was observed to suppress hyphae formation, resulting in markedly reduced growth (Figure5). A similar trend was observed in both the control and experimental groups forA. niger(Figure6). However, the growth ofA. nigerwas notably more suppressed compared toF. oxysporumin the experimental group.

Biosurfactants were produced and their toxicity was assessed on embryos at various concentrations and time frames. Following exposure to different concentrations of biosurfactants (30, 15, 7.5, 3.75, and 1.87 mg/mL), embryos were monitored for 24 and 96‐h post‐incubation. The findings revealed that the biosurfactants exhibited no adverse effects on the embryos at any of the tested concentrations or time intervals. On 10th day (after 24 h), first sample was taken and analysed. All were found alive and embryo weight and CR‐length was recorded (Table4). No discernible alterations in size, appearance, or growth inhibition were observed in the treated embryos. Their growth patterns remained normal, similar to untreated eggs or control samples. Notably, even at the highest concentration of 30 mg/mL, the biosurfactants did not elicit any toxic responses in the embryos. Additionally, various physical and qualitative parameters were evaluated (Tables4,5,6,7). The impact of AF_3B biosurfactants on the size and appearance of chicken embryos after 24 h is depicted in Figure7, whereas the corresponding effects after 96 h are illustrated in Figure8.

No changes were detected in the structural integrity of the heart and liver, and no observable physical abnormalities were detected. Histopathological examination revealed no notable changes, including the absence of congestion, haemorrhages, or enlargement in size, as depicted in Figure9. The liver plates look clear, hepatocytes have evenly coloured cytoplasm, and normal nuclei in the case of both biosurfactant treated and untreated control. Moreover, the heart muscles, myocards and adipocytes and connective tissues as well as cell nuclei look normal and even in shape and size in the case of both treated and biosurfactant untreated embryos (Figure9).

Overuse of chemical compounds to control pathogens has led to the development of resistance in these pathogens, contamination of groundwater and serious health hazards for people (Mandal et al.2013). Moreover, a multitude of pathogenic bacteria and fungi have developed resistance to diverse antibiotics and pharmaceutical drugs (Ongena and Jacques2008). The primary issue lies in the development of environmentally friendly alternatives that can be utilized in both industrial and medical sectors. There is an urgent requirement for alternative chemicals that can be effectively employed for therapeutic purposes, as well as in the preservation of dairy products and food (Mandal et al.2013).

TheBacillusgenus exhibits immense potential as probiotic microorganisms. In nature,Bacillusspecies are widely distributed and prevalent. These bacteria have the remarkable ability to produce over 200 antibiotics, each with its unique structure and spectrum of activity. CertainBacillusstrains are particularly effective against Gram‐negative bacteria, whereas others produce bacteriocins that specifically target bacteria of the same species. Additionally, there areBacillusstrains that demonstrate antifungal and antiprotozoal activities, expanding their antimicrobial repertoire (Moore et al.2013).

Biosurfactants are being utilized to improve the remediation of organic waste materials (Banat et al.2010). Biologically synthesized lipopeptides are valuable natural surfactants: as they are preferred over synthetic ones because of their minimal toxicity, excellent biodegradability and efficacy across a wide spectrum of pH levels and temperatures (Kosaric1992; Cameotra and Makkar1998). More studies have shown that lipopeptides production by biological means are economical and cost‐effective over chemical surfactants as these can be produced by using inexpensive wastes as carbon source using microbial strains (Makkar and Cameotra2002). The organic lipopeptide biosurfactants have emerged as a powerful antifungal agent as well as antibacterial agent when wound healing is under discussion (Ohadi et al.2023; Alara et al.2023; Ben Ayed et al.2015; Ohadi et al.2017).

The scope of this study was to produce lipopeptides biosurfactants from indigenous strains ofB. velezensis. Moreover, the main objective was to analyse the toxicity of lipopeptides biosurfactants produced by AF_3B. The isolate under investigation demonstrated the synthesis of various variants of antimicrobial compounds, with a particular emphasis on lipopeptides such as surfactin, iturin, and fengycin. These lipopeptides were found to be present and produced by the isolates, showcasing their potential antimicrobial properties. Antibacterial assay was done to check the activity of lipopeptides biosurfactants. The results of the antibacterial bioassay showed a significant inhibition of tested bacterial strains, includingBacillus subtilis(30 ±3 mm),Escherichia coli(11 ±2 mm),Salmonella typhi(12 ±1 mm), Xanthomonas oryzae(35 ±1 mm) andPseudomonas aeruginosa(24 ±2 mm) as given in Table2. The similar type antibacterial activities have also been reported in previous studies (Singh et al.2019).

Bacillusspecies are known for producing numerous secondary metabolites with potent properties, including lipopeptides that exhibit strong antifungal activity (Kiesewalter et al.2021). In this study, it was demonstrated by in vitro assays that a bacterial solution, containing lipopeptides biosurfactants produced by AF_3B in PDA, is able to suppress the growth of the main mycotoxigenic fungi. A recent study was performed that showed similar results (Bertuzzi et al.2022) where maximum average reduction was seen againstAlternaria alternata(86.2%) and againstFusarium graminearumthat was reported to be 85.7%. The growth of mycotoxigenic fungus was significantly reduced in both raw and cell‐freeBacillusbroths; raw broth, containing live cells, were more active in inhibition as compared to cell‐freeBacillusbroth.A. nigerwhen treated against raw broth caused average 86.7% fungal reduction, whereas the cell‐free broth caused an average reduction of 84.6%. Similarly, whenF. oxysporumwas treated against raw broth, average 83.6% reduction was seen and in cell‐free broth treatment, the average reduction was reported to be 79.2% (Table3) (Figures2,3). Visible colour difference of the flasks was seen (Figures4,5,6).

Moreover, no toxic effect on embryos growth was seen, and all the embryos were found alive and showed normal growth and weight gain as indicated by qualitative analysis and physical parameters (Table5). On 13th day (96 h after inoculation of dose), again the same procedure was repeated and results were noted (Tables6and7). Figures7,8show the pictorial evidence of embryos where it can be seen that embryos were normal in appearance and growth. In a recent study, in ovo toxicity of biosurfactants produced from waste‐based and standard media was determined (Behzadnia et al.2022). The previous study reported that no observable changes in size or appearance were noted, and there were no apparent inhibitory effects on growth. The growth of embryos appeared entirely normal. This paves a path for further study that can be done as wound healing cream can be formulated along with cleansing and anti‐ageing skincare products.

Surfactants can negatively influence chicken embryo development, particularly affecting the heart and liver. Studies have shown that surfactants can induce developmental cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity from some surfactants has also been reported. Developmental exposure to certain surfactants can cause cardiotoxicity, including cardiomyocyte enlargement of heart muscle cells) and fibrotic lesions and so forth. But in this study, lipopeptides biosurfactants produced by strain AF_3B exhibited no toxicity to embryo liver and heart cells as shown by histology studies (Figure9).

Current study provides evidence that lipopeptides biosurfactants are produced by AF_3B strain ofB. velezensis. It has antimicrobial activities against bacterial (Gram positive and Gram negative) and fungal pathogens, which can spoil food and are source for diseases in humans. The in vitro and in ovo toxicities were determined, and they were found to be as non‐toxic and safe. There was significant fungal reduction, and all the chicken embryos were found to be alive and normal which further confirmed the non‐toxic and safe behaviour of these strains. Therefore, this isolate would be useful candidates for biological control of bacterial and fungal diseases as well as for food borne pathogens. The lipopeptides biosurfactants produced by this isolate could also be used in cosmetic, cleaning and agriculture industry.
