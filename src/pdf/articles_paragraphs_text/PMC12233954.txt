We read the article entitled “Protein restriction in CKD: an outdated strategy in the modern era”1with interest and would like to make some critical comments regarding its conclusions.

The article emphasizes that a low-protein diet (LPD), traditionally used in the management of non-dialysis CKD patients, has no proven efficacy in slowing the progression of the disease and could entail risks such as malnutrition and a decrease in quality of life. At the same time, the text suggests that the emphasis on new drugs would offer a more comprehensive strategy, with lifestyle changes taking a back seat.

The authors present old studies in Table 2, citing several unfounded criticisms. The MDRD study had flaws, including a too-short observation period and the inclusion of patients too early, before a 3-month steady state was achieved. Rosman et al.2noted a delay in CKD progression with LPD and a reduction in serum urea, phosphate levels, and proteinuria. The criticisms, specifically the use of creatinine as an outcome measure and the subjective evaluation of LPD, do not invalidate the findings of this study. Such criticism appears unfounded when compared with the strong evidence demonstrating the benefits of the LPD approach3. Ihle et al.4also found that LPD is effective in slowing CKD progression. Even slight differences in protein intake (0.69 vs. 0.85 g/kg/day) can significantly lower serum urea and phosphate levels, the main uremic toxins5. They also reported the significant weight loss in the intervention group. However, it is important to note that the diet did not change markers of muscle mass, such as arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness.

Barsotti et al.6wrote a letter to the editor emphasizing that inadequate adherence to the LPD identified in the Locatelli et al.7study resulted in patients consuming significantly more protein than prescribed, undermining the intended LPD intervention. As reported in the study by Hansen et al.8, Bawazir et al.1failed to identify a significant difference between groups in progression to CKD stage 5 or death, with 27% of patients on a normal protein diet compared to 10% on a LPD (P = 0.042). The relative risk of stage 5 CKD or death was 0.23 (0.07 to 0.72) for patients on LPD after baseline adjustment for the presence of cardiovascular disease (P = 0.01). It is worth noting that the so-called “most recent study” by Bawazir et al.1is from 2009. Cianciaruso et al.9concluded that a diet of 0.55 g/kg per day does not appear to offer an advantage in the survival of patients compared to the also low protein diet of 0.8 g/kg per day. Contrary to the claims made by Bawazir et al.1, the authors concluded that LPD does not increase the risk of malnutrition when a nutritionist is involved in the team.

Despite the controversy about protein restriction for CKD patients, more recent studies10and meta-analyses3highlight the substantial benefits of an LPD in slowing the progression of CKD, so much so that studies refer to the most recent nutrition guidelines11. Furthermore, the risk of eventual malnutrition can be minimized by proper nutritional monitoring, focusing on the quality of protein intake and energy intake, as recommended by experts in renal nutrition. Thus, the LPD remains the cornerstone of CKD treatment for non-dialysis patients. The diet should always be adapted to the individual needs of the patient to optimize results, considering factors such as CKD stage and the patient’s general health, age, nutritional status, and comorbidities11. It is not fair to patients to talk about quality of life without mentioning the tremendous loss of quality of life when patients start maintenance dialysis, as they can postpone the start of dialysis for many months or years by ingesting a LPD. For ethical reasons, this information should be provided to the patients, regardless of what doctors think.

When well-planned and monitored, protein restriction is a valuable tool and should not be labeled as “obsolete” without a more thorough discussion of each patient’s specific conditions, including comorbidities, stage of CKD, nutritional status, and current studies.

Moreover, a carefully monitored LPD offers several advantages beyond slowing the progression of CKD. By reducing protein intake and ensuring an adequate energy supply as part of a healthy diet, patients can experience less accumulation of nitrogenous waste, phosphate, and uremic toxins, which helps maintain acid-base balance and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress (Figure 1).

KDIGO and KDOQI guidelines emphasize that non-pharmacological interventions are crucial in reducing cardiovascular risk and the progression of CKD. The approach to CKD patients must be multidisciplinary and involve nephrologists, nutritionists, physical educators, psychologists, and nurses. Focusing the discussion exclusively on nephrologists and drugs may underestimate the complexity of CKD management.

Nutritional interventions combined with modern pharmacotherapy remain fundamental to the comprehensive care of CKD patients.
