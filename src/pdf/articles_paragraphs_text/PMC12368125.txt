In recent years, the relationship between stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients has garnered increasing attention. However, its role in predicting the prognosis of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality in patients with SA-AKI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database. Critically ill patients diagnosed with SA-AKI were stratified according to the quartiles of SHR. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to compare survival differences among the groups. A Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for confounding factors, was employed to investigate the relationship between SHR and mortality. A total of 1822 adult patients with sepsis-associated renal injury were included in the study. The average age was 68 years, 1059 (59.58%) were male. The patient’s increased 30-day risk of death is associated with a higher SHR index, as indicated by the Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rankP< 0.001). Furthermore, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that the risk of mortality was significantly higher in the highest quartile of the SHR index. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis demonstrated U-shaped relationships between the SHR index and 30-day mortality, with inflection points at 0.67 for 30-day mortality. Compared to patients with SHR levels below these inflection points, those with higher levels had a 38.2% increased risk for 30-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.382; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.198–1.593). In patients with sepsis-related acute kidney injury, the SHR index can be used as an effective indicator to assess severity and guide treatment. While elevated SHR portends an increased risk of death, inadequate acute glycemic regulation also merits attention. These findings underscore the importance of SHR-based management for the prognosis of critically ill patients with SA-AKI and highlight the need for further multicenter clinical studies to establish the optimal diagnostic threshold for SHR.

Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from infection, remains one of the leading causes of death among critically ill patients worldwide, accounting for over 5.3 million deaths annually1. Approximately 30% of total hospital mortality, especially in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, is attributed to sepsis2. The kidneys are among the organs most adversely affected by sepsis, with studies indicating that 45–70% of acute kidney injury (AKI) cases are associated with sepsis3. The incidence of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is notably high within critically ill populations, with reported rates ranging from 11 to 64%4, and mortality rates reaching as high as 30.61–71.42%5. Patients suffering from SA-AKI often have a poor prognosis characterized by significantly increased in-hospital mortality and prolonged ICU and hospital stays, leading to substantial healthcare resource consumption and placing considerable strain on healthcare systems. Early identification of patients at risk for SA-AKI, coupled with timely and appropriate interventions, is critical for mitigating further renal damage and improving the overall prognosis.

Stress hyperglycemia is a common metabolic response observed in critically ill patients and is closely associated with adverse outcomes6,7. Glucose measurements obtained at the time of admission may be influenced by a patient’s chronic glycemic state, thus failing to fully represent the acute hyperglycemic condition. Consequently, researchers have proposed the use of the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), which accounts for the patient’s baseline glucose level and more accurately reflects glucose changes during acute stress8. Recent studies have investigated the relationship between SHR and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients, showing that a high SHR is correlated with adverse outcomes in conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, acute ischemic stroke, and heart failure9–11. However, the prognostic significance of SHR for SA-AKI as a unique syndrome driven by immunometabolic dysregulation and microcirculatory thrombosis (rather than a simple superposition of sepsis and AKI) has not yet been clarified. The pathophysiology of SA-AKI is multifactorial, involving inflammatory processes, microcirculatory dysfunction, and oxidative stress12. It is hypothesized that stress hyperglycemia may exacerbate SA-AKI by promoting these pathophysiological mechanisms, leading to endothelial damage and worsening patient outcomes13. The vicious cycle of ‘inflammation-hyperglycemia-tubular injury’ unique to SA-AKI (inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway) may make SHR play a dual role as an indicator of stress intensity and a driver of organ damage14. This mechanism has not been deeply explored in ordinary critical illness. Therefore, we hypothesized that SHR may be closely related to the prognosis of SA-AKI patients.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality in patients with SA-AKI via the MIMIC-IV, a large intensive care database. We will analyze the correlation between SHR and prognostic indicators such as 30-day mortality, and assess whether SHR can improve the predictive efficacy of existing prognostic scoring systems. With this study, we hope to provide new ideas for risk stratification and individualized treatment of SA-AKI patients, ultimately improving the prognosis of these patients.

This study is a retrospective cohort study. The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV), a publicly available database compiled from the electronic health records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). MIMIC-IV data were collected from patients treated in the BIDMC Emergency Department or Intensive Care Unit between 2008 and 2019. The MIMIC database has received ethical approval from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2001-P-001699/14) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (No. 0403000206) The Institutional Review Boards granted approval for data sharing, waiving the requirement for individual patient consent. The data in the MIMIC-IV database are publicly available; therefore, this study is exempt from the requirements of the ethical approval statement and informed consent. All the reports followed the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines15.

Patients with sepsis who met the Sepsis-3 guideline1diagnostic criteria were eligible for inclusion in the study. Among these septic patients, individuals with AKI were selected for the study on the basis of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria16. AKI is defined as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL over 48 h, or an increase to ≥ 1.5 times the baseline value over 7 days17. Patients who died within 7 days of admission to the intensive care unit without any stage of AKI were considered to be without SA-AKI.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age < 18 years and (2) ICU stay shorter than 24 h.

SA-AKI was defined as AKI in septic patients occurring within 7 days of admission to the ICU18. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes was ICU mortality.

A structured query language (SQL) was employed to extract clinically relevant data from the MIMIC-IV database. The data collected included demographic information (age, gender, marital status, admission weight, height, BMI (body mass index)), comorbidities (chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lung disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral vascular disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic disease, parasitic ulcer, paraplegia, metastatic solid tumor, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severity scores: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Acute Physiology Score III(APSIII), Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS) and laboratory parameters: glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglycerides, triglyceride-glucose Index (TyG), triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), triglycerides, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count (PLT), white blood cell count (WBC), albumin, anion gap, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatinine, sodium, potassium, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Laboratory parameter chamber and vital sign collection chamber first value within 24 h of admission.

Sample size calculations were not performed as this study was a retrospective analysis. Variables with more than 20% missing data were excluded, and for variables with less than 20% missing data, multiple imputation was used. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of quartiles of the SHR. Normally distributed continuous variables are presented as the means (standard deviations [SDs]) and were analyzed via analysis of variance (ANOVA). The analysis of non-normally distributed variables was conducted using either the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables are expressed as numbers and percentages and were analysed using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare the 30-day mortality among the four groups according to the log-rank test. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to evaluate multicollinearity between variables. Variables with VIF over 5 are removed because of multicollinearity concerns. Proportional hazard regression models (Cox regression models) were employed for the assessment of the hazard ratio (HR) and the associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for event occurrence. We constructed two different multivariate Cox proportional risk models. Model I is not adjusted for covariates. Model Ⅲ was adjusted for gender, marital status, hypertension, diabetes, care unit, CRRT, vasoactive used, invasive ventilation, age, BMI, sofa score, heart rate, MBP, resprate, temperature and transcutaneous oxygen saturation.

The SHR index was also analyzed as a continuous variable using restricted cubic splines (RCS) to clarify the dose-response association with the risk of major and secondary outcomes. If the association was nonlinear, a recursive algorithm was employed to determine the inflection point between the SHR index and mortality at 30 days. To further explore the relationship between the SHR index and mortality at these time points, a two-stage Cox proportional hazards model was applied on either side of the inflection point.

We performed a sensitivity analysis to ensure that our analysis was robust. To determine modifications and interactions, subgroup analyses were performed according to sex (male or female), age, hypertension (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no). Cox proportional risk regression analyses were performed for each subgroup, and the results were presented visually using forest plots illustrating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.1). Differences were deemed statistically significant atP< 0.05.

Among the adult patients in the MIMIC-IV database, 33,177 satisfied the sepsis-3.0 criterion upon first ICU admission. A total of 1822 patients were ultimately included in this study. The flowchart of the patient inclusion process is shown in Fig.1.

Table1presents a comprehensive overview of the baseline characteristics of the study population, organized by quartiles of the Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio (SHR). Patients were categorized into quartiles: Q1 (SHR < 0.87), Q2 (0.87 ≤ SHR < 1.07), Q3 (1.07 ≤ SHR < 1.32), and Q4 (1.32 ≤ SHR). The mean age of the patients was 68.00 (58.00, 79.00) years, with a predominance of male patients, accounting for 1,059 individuals (58.31%). The prevalence of various comorbidities was as follows: congestive heart failure was observed in 692 patients (38.11%), peripheral vascular disease in 237 patients (13.05%), cerebrovascular disease in 462 patients (25.44%), Chronic pulmonary disease in 546 patients (30.07%),liver disease in 491 patients (27.04%), diabetes in 612 patients (33.70%), AIDS in 14 patients (0.77%), malignant cancer in 326 patients (17.95%), vasoactive used in 1342 patients (73.90%), myocardial Infarct in 402 patients (22.14%). Patients within Quartile 4 presented elevated levels of blood glucose, white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, tyG, tyG BMI, potassium, vasoactive used and creatinine, alongside reduced levels of ALP and SpO2. Additionally, this group demonstrated a higher likelihood of having experienced a myocardial infarction and a greater prevalence of diabetes than did the three other quartiles.

The 30-day mortality and follow-up survival status at 30, 60, 90, and 365 days were analyzed in patients categorized by different SHR levels (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) (Table2). The results of the chi-square test demonstrated statistically significant differences in mortality rates among the groups at various time points, particularly at 30, 60, and 90 days (allP< 0.01). The 30-day mortality increased with increasing levels of SHR. Notably, the Q3 group exhibited the lowest mortality rate across these time points. However, at the 365-day follow-up, the differences in survival status between the groups were not statistically significant.

With respect to 30-day mortality, the results of Cox regression analyses indicated a significant increase in the risk of death for patients in Q3 and Q4 compared with those in Q1 (Model I and ModelⅡ). Additionally, Model Ⅲ demonstrated a significant increase in the risk of death for patients in Q3 and Q4 relative to those in Q1 (Table3).Similar trends were observed for ICU death all-cause mortality, as detailed in TableS1.

RCS curve analyses were adjusted for the effects of gender, marital status, hypertension, diabetes, care unit, CRRT, vasoactive used, invasive ventilation, age, BMI, sofa score, heart rate, MBP, respiration rate, temperature and transcutaneous oxygen saturation. The median is used as a reference point; the RCS curve analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between the SHR index and all-cause mortality across various points. More specifically, the SHR index demonstrated a U-shaped association with mortality at the 30-day and ICU mortality marks (Fig.2A and B).

To further investigate this nonlinear relationship, two-piecewise Cox proportional hazard models were employed (Pfor log-likelihood ratio < 0.05 in both models) (Tables4and5). The analysis identified an inflection point of 0.67 for 30-day all-cause mortality and an inflection point of 0.74 for ICU mortality. There was a correlation between SHR and 30-day risk of death at SHR < 0.67 (P< 0.001), and a correlation between SHR and 30-day risk of mortality at SHR > 0.67 (P< 0.001).

Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess the effect of the SHR index on endpoints across the study population. There was a significant difference in 30-day mortality between the entire study population (log-rankP< 0.001) (Fig.3).

We performed a Landmark analysis with a 14-day cut-off point in the Kaplan-Meier curve, which showed that there was a significant difference in survival between different SHR groups before and after 14 days (Log-rankP= 0.008 andP= 0.021). However, the trend of Q2, Q3, and Q4 deaths greater than Q1 was more pronounced after 14 days (Fig.4).

We further stratified various subgroups of the population to investigate the relationship between the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis-related kidney injury (Fig.5). After adjusting for confounders, the risk of death was significantly increased in the Q4 group in older patients aged ≥ 65 years and with hypertension, and similar results were observed in male patients, with SHR in the Q4 group compared to the Q1 group, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.49 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.88,P< 0.001) in the Q4 group. This suggests that elevated SHR may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in older adults, hypertension, and male patients with sepsis-related kidney injury. However, no clear correlation was observed between SHR levels and all-cause mortality in other subgroups, such as women and non-diabetic (allPvalues > 0.05).

This study thoroughly investigated the relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality in patients with severe SA-AKI. We report a U-shaped relationship between SHR and mortality during hospitalization in patients with SA-AKI. The findings indicate that the mortality rate is minimized at an SHR value of approximately 0.920, with both excessively high and low values being associated with increased mortality risk.

Previous studies have demonstrated independent correlations between SHR and adverse outcomes across various diseases19–21. For instance, Yang et al. analyzed data from 5,562 patients with acute coronary syndrome over a two-year follow-up period and reported a U-shaped relationship between SHR and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). They reported that a deviation of 0.78 in SHR was associated with a significant increase in MACE risk19. Additionally, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, SHR exhibited a nonlinear association with both 30-day mortality and neurological deterioration. The evidence suggests that SHR is a valid indicator for assessing the prognosis of critically ill patients; however, there is heterogeneity in its prognostic relationships across different diseases, which may manifest as U-shaped, J-shaped, or linear correlations. In the context of SA-AKI, studies investigating the relationship between SHR and prognosis are lacking. This study validates, for the first time, the U-shaped association between SHR and mortality in patients with SA-AKI. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms contributing to this U-shaped association remain unclear.

The observed U-shaped association between SHR and prognosis in SA-AKI patients may be attributed to several mechanisms. On the one hand, a low SHR may indicate an inadequate stress response in SA-AKI patients. During the early stages of critical illnesses such as sepsis, the body mobilizes hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to elevate stress hyperglycemia, thereby ensuring an adequate glucose supply to vital organs including the kidneys22; Moderate levels of stress hyperglycemia might mitigate sepsis-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells by upregulating antiapoptotic proteins and inhibiting apoptotic pathways, such as cysteine asparaginase23–25; consequently, when the stress response is inadequate and SHR is low, renal cells could experience accelerated apoptotic necrosis due to insufficient glucose supply and impaired energy metabolism. This situation may exacerbate acute kidney injury, thereby increasing mortality risk among patients. Moreover, a low SHR may also reflect insufficient secretion of endogenous catecholamines and cortisol. These hormones are crucial for maintaining hemodynamic stability and enhancing tissue perfusion during the early stages of critical illness26,27. Catecholamines improve myocardial contractility and cardiac output while sustaining perfusion pressure in vital organs, such as the kidneys, via α-adrenergic receptor activation. Cortisol can enhance the pressor effects of catecholamines and attenuate sepsis-induced organ damage through its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties28.

On the other hand, high SHR indicates a severe stress hyperglycemic state that can exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through various mechanisms. In a hyperglycemic environment, enhanced mitochondrial electron transport chain activity and NADPH oxidase activation lead to increased ROS production29,30. Hyperglycemia may also deplete antioxidant reserves and inhibit antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing overall antioxidant capacity31. An imbalance between oxidative and antioxidant processes accelerates the apoptosis and necrosis of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with SA-AKI. In vitro and animal studies have shown that elevated glucose levels stimulate immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory factors and monocyte chemokines32,33. Additionally, hyperglycemia induces the expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, promoting the adhesion of immune cells to damaged endothelium and their infiltration into the renal mesenchyme34. Consequently, hyperglycemia may promote distant renal fibrosis in SA-AKI patients through inflammatory pathways. Together, these processes create a vicious cycle that exacerbates SIRS, leading to MODS. Persistent hyperglycemia can also severely impair vascular endothelial function35. Increased vascular permeability induced by endothelial cell apoptosis can exacerbate the local inflammatory response. Endothelial damage also exposes the basement membrane, activating the coagulation cascade. The hyperglycemic state activates platelets, enhancing their aggregation and adhesion36while also promoting the synthesis and activation of coagulation factors37. Additionally, hyperglycemia elevates the expression of PAI-1, which inhibits the fibrinolytic process38. Together, these changes foster a hypercoagulable state and elevate the risk of thrombosis, potentially exacerbating organ dysfunction.

In patients with SA-AKI, the high SHR state has a direct damaging effect on the kidney. Hyperglycemia can directly damage renal tubular epithelial cells, leading to apoptosis and necrosis39.Prolonged hyperglycemia can lead to thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, affecting filtration function. In addition, hyperglycemia affects sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and interferes with the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism40. Together, these effects exacerbate renal impairment in patients with SA-AKI, increasing the risk of acute renal failure and thus mortality.

We found that elevated SHR may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in elderly and male patients with sepsis-associated renal injury after correction for confounders. Renal tubular injury and inflammatory damage in stress hyperglycemic states are particularly pronounced in elderly patients with reduced renal reserve function41. Moreover, elderly patients are more likely to experience significant hyperglycemic under acute stress due to diminished metabolic regulation, which demonstrates a decreased ability of the kidneys to cope with acute injury42. In male patients, this metabolic imbalance exacerbates the severity of AKI and increases the risk of death in sepsis due to the secretion of higher levels of cortisol and norepinephrine in response to stress43. Together, these factors contribute to the association between elevated SHR and poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. The association of SHR with prognosis was not significant in women or nondiabetic patients. This finding suggests that the prognostic value of SHR may vary according to distinct population characteristics. The presence of protective hormone levels in female patients, the physiological compensatory capacity of younger patients, and the specific metabolic profiles of diabetic individuals may influence the relationship between SHR and prognosis. This result underscores the importance of considering individualized patient characteristics when the SHR is used for risk assessment.

SHR incorporates an adjustment for prior glycemic status through HbA1c, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the degree of acute hyperglycemia in patients than dose a single point-in-time blood glucose measurement44. Epidemiologic studies have shown that patients with hyperglycemia and elevated HbA1c have a worse prognosis than those with hyperglycemia alone45. This evidence supports the use of SHR as a valid indicator for assessing stress hyperglycemia and guiding clinical glycemic management. Nonetheless, the optimal diagnostic threshold for SHR remains inconclusive and requires validation through large prospective studies. The U-shaped association of SHR highlights the necessity of avoiding excessive glucose lowering and risks of overlooking hyperglycemia in clinical practice. In patients with sepsis, particularly those with renal injury, both excessively low and high SHR levels may increase the risk of mortality. Consequently, clinicians should be vigilant in maintaining blood glucose levels within an appropriate range when managing glycemic control in these patients to mitigate the risk of death. These findings are expected to inform improvements in management strategies for patients with sepsis, ultimately optimizing patient outcomes.

However, several limitations must be acknowledged in this study. First, this was a retrospective analysis conducted among a large cohort of critically ill patients, precluding the establishment of a causal relationship between SHR and prognosis. Second, the long-term association between SHR and adverse outcomes could not be evaluated due to the absence of long-term follow-up data in this cohort. Third, the predictive value of SHR for mortality needs to be validated in an external cohort. Fourth, the selection bias in this study stems from the fact that HbA1c testing is not routinely performed in ICUs. Therefore, the conclusions are applicable to sepsis-related AKI patients in ICUs who require assessment of their glycemic status. Future research should focus on validating these findings in large-scale prospective studies.

In summary, this study revealed a U-shaped association between SHR and 30-day mortality in patients with SA-AKI. The findings emphasized that mortality was elevated at both low and high SHR levels, with an inflection point of 0.67 for poor prognosis. SHR may serve as a reliable predictor for assessing adverse outcomes in patients with SA-AKI and has the potential to improve the predictive accuracy of traditional severity scores. However, multicenter, prospective studies are needed to validate these results.
