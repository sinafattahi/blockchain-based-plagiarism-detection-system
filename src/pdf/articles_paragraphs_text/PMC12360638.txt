A 59-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a one-month history of intense itchy rashes in the umbilicus and periumbilical skin. Physical examination revealed erythematous papules with excoriation, crusting, and scaling in the umbilical region (Figure 1). Microscopic examination of skin scrapings collected from the umbilical fossa using a sterile blade revealed abundantSarcoptes scabieieggshell fragments, fecal pellets, and scattered eggs distributed within a characteristic burrow (Figure 2). The patient was treated with 10% compound sulfur cream applied nightly for five consecutive days, resulting in complete resolution of the lesions.

Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the burrowing miteS. scabiei. The hallmark skin lesion of scabies is a burrow-like structure, typically located in the interdigital spaces, hands, wrists, axillae, feet, buttocks, and genital regions1.

The identification of mites, eggs, eggshell fragments, and mite pellets confirmed the diagnosis of scabies. The life cycle ofS. scabieilasts for approximately four to six weeks. During this period, adult females lay two to four eggs per day within burrows in the stratum corneum. Two to four days after laying, the larvae emerge from their shells, leaving behind characteristic eggshell fragments. These remnants often appear as V-shaped, double-leaf fragments because the shell fractures into two connected pieces2. Owing to its unique anatomical structure, the umbilical fossa may serve as an optimal incubation site for female scabies mites.
