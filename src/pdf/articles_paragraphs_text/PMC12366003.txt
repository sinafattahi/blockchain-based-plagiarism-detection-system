The emergence of difficult-to-treat resistant (DTR)Pseudomonas aeruginosainfections poses a significant clinical challenge, characterized by limited treatment options, poor outcomes, and increased morbidity and mortality. DTRP. aeruginosaisolates exhibit resistance to all first-line antibiotics, necessitating the use of less effective or more toxic alternatives. This study estimated the incidence of DTRP. aeruginosainfections in Lebanon and identified the associated risk factors.

This retrospective observational study was conducted across four tertiary care centers in Beirut, Lebanon, over a three-year period from 2021 to 2023. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors associated with DTRP. aeruginosainfections.

A total of 2,639 cases with positiveP. aeruginosaisolates were initially screened, with 477 cases meeting the inclusion criteria for analysis. The mean age of the patients was 66.3 ± 17.8 years, and the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4.46 ± 2.43. Nearly half of the infections were nosocomial (47.6%). The most common primary site of infection was the respiratory tract (38.8%), followed by skin and soft tissue (32.7%). The incidence of DTRP. aeruginosawas 15.3%, and the incidence of carbapenem-resistantP. aeruginosa(CRPA) was 29.9%. Binary logistic regression identified three main risk factors for DTRP. aeruginosainfection acquisition: infections occurring during the winter season (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.08, 95% CI = 2.75–16.13,P< 0.01), intensive care unit stay (AOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.28–4.98,P< 0.01), and infections originating from the respiratory tract (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.04–5.97,P= 0.04).

The incidence of DTRP. aeruginosain Lebanese hospitals is substantial compared to global rates and poses a significant challenge to effective treatment. Urgent measures are required to prevent and mitigate the spread of DTRP. aeruginosainfections. Hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programs need to be reinforced, and community-based initiatives should be implemented at the national level. Efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance must be supported by ongoing nationwide annual surveillance.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, is a prevalent cause of nosocomial infections and is associated with severe illness and high mortality rates, ranging from 10.5 to 71%, depending on the site of infection, patient comorbidities, and antimicrobial resistance profile [1–9]. This global public health threat is further exacerbated by the pathogen’s intrinsic antibiotic resistance and its exceptional ability to develop complex resistance mechanisms, significantly limiting treatment options [10,11]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identifiedP. aeruginosa, a member of the ESKAPE group of high priority pathogens, as one of the leading drug-resistant bacteria in need of urgent research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions [12].

In addition to its clinical impact, infections caused byP. aeruginosaimpose a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. These infections are associated with prolonged hospital stays, increased need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, a greater risk of treatment failure, and elevated hospital readmission rates [13–15]. A recent study assessing the economic impact ofP. aeruginosainfections revealed that patients infected with resistant strains, compared to those with susceptible isolates, experienced significantly worse outcomes. These included higher mortality (20% vs. 15.5%,P= 0.002), an average excess hospital stay of 6.7 days (P< 0.001), an additional cost of approximately US$20,000 per case (P= 0.002), and an incremental net financial loss exceeding US$10,000 per patient, as well as higher 30-day readmission rate (16.2% vs. 11.1%,P= 0.006) [13].

Studies from Lebanese hospitals have shown thatP. aeruginosais a major contributor to hospital-acquired infections, accounting for 12% of all nosocomial infections [16], and approximately 9.6% of Gram-negative bloodstream infections [17]. It consistently ranks among the top three to four most common pathogens in ICU and hospital-acquired bloodstream infections [16–18].

Recent years have seen several proposed classifications for antibiotic resistance, with the system by Magiorakos et al. being the most widely adopted. This classification includes multidrug-resistance (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pandrug-resistant (PDR), based on the number of antibiotic classes showing activity in vitro [19]. Additionally, another classification system based on resistance to specific antibiotic classes such as fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, has been introduced [11,20,21].

While these systems are useful epidemiologically, they have been criticized for their limited practical application in clinical settings and weak prediction of patient outcomes, particularly inP. aeruginosainfections [11,20]. For instance, the Magiorakos et al. classification requires resistance to only one agent per class and weighs all antibiotics equally, regardless of their efficacy and toxicity [11,19–21]. Furthermore, while resistance to antibiotic classes such as carbapenems indicates limited treatment options,P. aeruginosacan still respond to antipseudomonal penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones despite carbapenem resistance [11,20,21]. A new classification, difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR), has been recently proposed, which focuses on non-susceptibility to all first-line antibiotics, including all β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, thus necessitating the use of less effective or more toxic alternatives [11,21].

Infections caused by MDR and DTRP. aeruginosahave been linked to a variety of clinical and patient-related risk factors. Previous studies have identified several predisposing factors, including prior use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior hospitalization or ICU stay, prolonged hospital stay, exposure to mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support, tracheostomy, prior surgery, and prior colonization/infection [21–23]. Additionally, underlying medical conditions such as uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus, severe COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, a bedridden state, and renal failure are significant predictors for acquiring MDRP. aeruginosainfections [21–23]. Higher baseline illness severity has also been significantly associated with the acquisition of DTR Gram-negative pathogens [21,22].

Despite the rising concern over DTRP. aeruginosadue to its high resistance profile and significant impact on patient outcomes, there remains a notable research gap attributable to the limited number of well-designed global studies that investigated its incidence and associated predictors [11,20–22,24]. This gap is particularly pronounced in the context of Lebanese hospitals, where the incidence and risk factors for DTRP. aeruginosainfections remain underexplored. To address this issue, the current study aimed to estimate the incidence of DTRP. aeruginosainfections in Lebanese hospitals and identify the associated risk factors.

This multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted among hospitalized patients who were infected withP. aeruginosa. The research was carried out at four tertiary care centers in Beirut, Lebanon, over a three-year period from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023.

The study included hospitalized adult patients aged 18 years and older with a confirmedP. aeruginosainfection. Exclusion criteria comprised cases of colonization, incomplete medical records or missing clinical data, incomplete antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), and patients with polymicrobial infections or coinfections. For patients with recurrent infections, only the first episode was included to avoid overestimation and to allow for incidence calculation. To distinguish colonization from infection, the review relied on documented clinical assessments and physicians’ progress notes, which specifically classified the presence ofP. aeruginosaas either colonization or infection. The decision to exclude polymicrobial and co-infections was made to ensure a more homogeneous study population, and reduce selection bias.

Data collection was conducted by systematically reviewing medical records provided by the microbiology laboratories at the participating hospitals. These records pertained to patients who tested positive forP. aeruginosaclinical isolates during the study period. A standardized data collection form, developed by the study’s principal investigator after a thorough review of relevant literature, was used to record pertinent information [11,21,24–32]. The form was divided into three main sections.

The first section captured patient demographics and clinical data, such as sex, age, total duration of hospitalization, onset of infection, site of infection acquisition, and the hospital department where the infection was acquired (for nosocomial cases). The onset of infection was defined as the date when the culture that eventually grewP. aeruginosawas collected [29]. Infections were classified as either community-acquired (onset of signs and symptoms before or within 48 h of admission), or nosocomial (hospital-acquired, with onset after 48 h of admission) [33]. Additionally, the length of stay prior to infection acquisition, defined as the period of hospitalization before the infection onset, was also noted [34]. The isolation frequency was calculated for each season, classified as follows: winter (December, January, and February), spring (March, April, and May), summer (June, July, and August), and fall (September, October, and November) [26].

The second section documented the patient’s underlying medical conditions and potential risk factors. Additionally, the patient’s Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score was calculated. The CCI is a widely used clinical tool that predicts long-term mortality risk based on the presence of multiple comorbidities, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of mortality [35–37]. Additional risk factors, such as prior hospitalization, antibiotic use, and exposure to chemotherapy within the three months preceding infection acquisition, were also recorded. Recent antibiotic use was defined as the administration of any systemic antibiotic for at least 72 h within the three months before infection onset [29]. The use of glucocorticoids within the past month was documented if the patient received a daily dose of 10 mg or more of prednisolone (or equivalent) for over five consecutive days within the four weeks before infection onset [38]. This section also noted any invasive medical procedures or surgeries performed within a month prior to infection onset [39].

The third section focused on microbiological data, including details about the type of specimen obtained, the date of specimen retrieval, the primary site of infection, and the AST results of the isolated pathogen. Based on the AST results, isolates were classified according to their phenotypic resistance profiles as either difficult-to-treat resistant (DTR)P. aeruginosaor non-DTRP. aeruginosa, and as carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa(CRPA) or carbapenem-sensitiveP. aeruginosa(CSPA). DTRP. aeruginosawas defined as non-susceptibility (intermediate or resistant) to all of the following: carbapenems (imipenem-cilastatin and/or meropenem), extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftazidime and/or cefepime), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and/or levofloxacin). Additional agents like piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam were also considered when results were reported [21]. CRPA was defined as an isolate intermediate or resistant to meropenem and/or imipenem-cilastatin, whereas CSPA was defined as an isolate not resistant or intermediate to these antibiotics [21].

Microbiological identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) ofP. aeruginosaisolates were performed in the microbiology labs of the four participating hospitals, each following their standard diagnostic protocols. At Hospitals 1 and 2, both identification and susceptibility testing were conducted using the VITEK 2 automated system (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France), which provides minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for various antibiotics. In contrast, Hospitals 3 and 4 applied the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique, adhering to the guidelines set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The inhibition zones produced by the antibiotics were manually measured and subsequently validated with an automated zone reader (ADAGIO, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The results from all hospitals were interpreted according to CLSI breakpoint criteria, classifying the isolates as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant [40].

Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS®, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), version 24. Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviations (SDs), while categorical variables were reported as frequencies and their relative percentages. The associations between DTRP. aeruginosaand independent categorical variables were examined using Pearson’s χ2 test, whereas the associations between continuous variables and DTRP. aeruginosawere evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Variables with aP-value of less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariable model.

The initial set of variables considered for inclusion were: season, site of infection acquisition (community-acquired versus nosocomial infection), ICU stay, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous hospitalization within the last three months, previous antibiotics use within the last three months, length of hospital stay prior to infection acquisition, invasive procedures conducted within 30 days prior to infection acquisition, presence of a central venous line, and the physiological primary site of infection.

To check for multicollinearity, variance inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated using a cut-off value of 10 used for exclusion. All variables had VIFs under 2.5, indicating no significant multicollinearity. Variables that were conceptually related were carefully evaluated for clinical relevance and their contribution to model performance. Based on this evaluation, ICU stay was retained due to its stronger association with patient outcomes, while the site of infection acquisition was excluded. Similarly, the central venous line variable was removed because of its overlap with the more comprehensive variable recent invasive procedures, which was retained.

The final multivariable logistic regression model was developed using a stepwise backward selection approach. Variables were considered confounders and retained if their removal resulted in a change of 10% or more in the coefficient of a statistically significant predictor. Model fit was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results with a P-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The study was designed and executed in adherence to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki guidelines [41]. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at Beirut Arab University (approval code: 2023-H-0089-P-R-0532). Furthermore, ethical approvals were obtained from the IRBs and ethical committees of the participating hospitals: first hospital (approval code: 2023-IRB-012), second hospital (approval code: 8785/AM/T/BDM/Classification 30350/1), third hospital (approval code: 6/2023), and fourth hospital (approval code: HOP-2023-006). Data collection involved a comprehensive review of de-identified and anonymized medical records, with no direct patient contact or follow-up. The IRBs and ethical committees of the participating hospitals granted a waiver for patient’s informed consent due to the study’s retrospective observational design, which involved data collection post-discharge and ensured that no patient identifiers were accessed. This approach preserved patient privacy and adhered to ethical standards for such observational research.

A total of 2,639 cases with positiveP. aeruginosaisolates were initially screened. Out of these, 2,162 cases were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Consequently, 477 patients withP. aeruginosainfections were included in this study.

The mean age of the patients was 66.32 ± 17.88 years, with an age range of 18 to 101 years (Table1). Approximately two-thirds of the patients were males (294, 61.6%). Nearly half of the infections were community-acquired (250, 52.4%), while the rest were nosocomial (227, 47.6%), primarily acquired in the ICU (118/227, 20%). The mean onset of nosocomial infection was 12.48 ± 5.38 days. More than one-fourth of the infections occurred during the fall season, accounting for 131 cases (27.4%).

Most patients had coexisting medical conditions (431, 90.4%), with the most common being hypertension (246, 51.6%), type II diabetes mellitus (198, 41.5%), and coronary artery disease (146, 30.6%) (Table1). The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 4.46 ± 2.43, ranging from 0 to 11. Less than one-fourth of the patients had been hospitalized within three months prior to infection acquisition, while one-quarter had received antibiotics in the last three months preceding the infection (116, 24.3%). Additionally, one-third of the patients were exposed to invasive medical procedures before acquiring the infection (164, 34.5%), including mechanical ventilation (56, 11.7%), indwelling urethral catheterization (54, 11.3%), surgery (34, 7.1%), and central venous line placement (28, 5.9%).

TheP. aeruginosaisolates were retrieved from various specimens, including skin (164, 34.4%), sputum (108, 22.6%), urine (98, 20.5%), deep tracheal aspirate (67, 14%), blood (18, 3.8%), bronchial aspirate (8, 1.7%), bile fluid (4, 0.8%), abdominal abscess (4, 0.8%), bone (2, 0.4%), gallbladder fluid (2, 0.4%), and broncho-alveolar lavage (2, 0.4%). The most common primary site of infection was the respiratory tract (185, 38.8%), followed by skin and soft tissue (156, 32.7%), urinary tract (98, 20.5%), bloodstream (18, 3.8%), intra-abdominal (10, 2.1%), surgical site (8, 1.7%), and bone (2, 0.4%).

Table2presents the antimicrobial susceptibility results of the isolates. Resistance was lowest to colistin (0.9%), tobramycin (8.4%), and amikacin (10.1%). Higher resistance rates were noted for meropenem (27.5%), imipenem (24.4%), aztreonam (22.7%), and ciprofloxacin (20.4%). Resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam (16.3%), ceftazidime (15.6%), and cefepime (11.8%) was also observed.

The CRPA rate was 29.9%. Notably, almost half of the isolates were AMR (221, 46.3%), with 29.8% being MDR and 16.6% XDR‎. None of the isolates were PDR. The incidence of DTR was 15.3%.

Table3presents the univariate analysis of the potential risk factors associated with the acquisition of DTRP. aeruginosainfection. The analysis identified nine significant risk factors.P. aeruginosaisolates acquired from the ICU ‎were significantly more likely to be DTR compared to other settings (unadjusted odds ratio [UOR] = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.98–5.58,P< 0.001). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had twice the odds of acquiring a DTR infection (UOR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.11–3.71,P= 0.01). Additionally, patients who were previously hospitalized (UOR = 3.48, 95% CI = 2.06–5.89,P< 0.001) and those who received antibiotics within the three months prior to infection acquisition (UOR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.32–3.79,P< 0.01) were more likely to acquire a DTR pathogen. Nosocomial infections were more likely associated with DTR strains than community-acquired infections (UOR = ‎3.50, 95% CI = 2.02–6.08,P< 0.001). A longer hospital stay prior to infection acquisition was also a significant predictor for acquiring a DTR infection (P= 0.03). Furthermore, exposure to invasive medical procedures (UOR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.27–3.47,P< 0.01), including the insertion of a central venous line (UOR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.05–5.59,P= 0.04), significantly increased the risk of acquiring a DTRP. aeruginosainfection.

The binary logistic regression revealed three main risk factors significantly associated with the acquisition of DTRP. aeruginosainfection (Table4). Specifically, infections occurring during the winter season (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.08, 95% CI = 2.75–16.13,P< 0.01), ICU stay (AOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.28–4.98,P< 0.01), and infections originating from the respiratory tract (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.04–5.97,P= 0.04) were more likely to be associated with DTRP. aeruginosaacquisition.

The emergence of DTRP. aeruginosainfections presents a significant clinical challenge due to limited treatment options, poor outcomes, and their association with high morbidity and mortality. DTRP. aeruginosaisolates are resistant to all first-line antibiotics, necessitating the use of less effective or more toxic reserve antibiotics [21]. This study investigated the incidence of DTRP. aeruginosaand its associated risk factors in Lebanese hospitals, aiming to contribute to the global understanding of this challenging pathogen.

The current study revealed incidence of 15.3% of DTRP. aeruginosainfections among hospitalized patients. This rate is notably higher when compared to global trends reported in various studies. Wise et al. investigated global trends in DTR among clinical isolates of Gram-negative priority pathogens collected by the Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) program from 2018 to 2022. Among these were 30,504P. aeruginosaisolates collected by 157 medical centers in 49 countries. The DTRP. aeruginosarates ranged from 6% in North America to 12% in Latin America. In the Middle East and Africa region, DTRP. aeruginosarate ranged between 8 and 10% from 2018 to 2022 [42]. A previous study conducted on collected clinical isolates from the Middle Eastern and African countries between 2015 and 2018 reported DTRP. aeruginosarates of 5.2–7.4% [43]. This indicates a substantial increase in the DTR rates in the region over time. Additionally, the prevalence of DTRP. aeruginosabloodstream infections in a retrospective single-center study conducted in Italy from 2013 to 2016 was 7.7% [11]. Another retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Singapore, which reviewed laboratory antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data between 2019 and 2021, detected a DTRP. aeruginosarate to be 3.07% out of 4,715 isolates [31]. The regional differences in DTR rates are often due to the varying incidence of enzyme-based resistance mechanisms. When benchmarking the DTRP. aeruginosarates in Lebanon against these reported global rates, it is evident that the rate in Lebanon is the highest.

The rate of CRPA in this study was notably high, with approximately one-third of the isolates (~ 30%) exhibiting resistance. These findings are consistent with the data from a national multicenter study conducted in 2015 and 2016, which included clinical isolates from 13 Lebanese hospitals and reflected Lebanon’s antimicrobial susceptibility landscape. This national study reported a CRPA rate of 30%, with individual hospitals showing rates ranging from 5 to 45% [44]. Additionally, the resistance rate ofP. aeruginosato imipenem showed a significant increase, rising from 27% between 2011 and 2013 to 30% between 2015 and 2016 (P= 0.001) [44,45]. Additionally, a multicenter national study conducted among three hospitals in northern Lebanon reported the prevalence of CRPA between 2015 and 2019 to be 15% (155/1,034 isolates) [46]. A recent retrospective observational study conducted in a Jordanian academic hospital between 2021 and 2022 detected a prevalence rate of CRPA at 41.9% [47]. In comparison, a recent study investigating global trends of AMR among 30,504 clinical isolates ofP. aeruginosareported high CRPA rates, ranging from 19% in the Asia Pacific region to 30% in Latin America between 2018 and 2022. Interestingly, this global study found that the CRPA trend in the Middle East and Africa region significantly decreased from 28% in 2018 to 22.4% in 2022 (P< 0.01) [42].

While the CRPA rate in Lebanon remains consistently high at around 30%, the global trends show variation, with some regions experiencing higher rates and others, like the Middle East and Africa, witnessing a decline. The discrepancies in CRPA rates observed across different studies can be attributed to several factors, including variations in study design, geographic and regional differences, resistance mechanisms, the time frame of the studies, patient populations, healthcare infrastructure, and infection control practices. In the context of Lebanon—a low-income country currently grappling with multifaceted crises—the CRPA rate has remained consistently high. This suggests that Lebanon may be facing significant challenges with AMR, potentially due to limited healthcare resources, the absence of a robust national surveillance program, widespread and unregulated antibiotic use, and inadequate infection control practices [29,48,49].

These challenges are further compounded by the fact that Lebanon currently lacks a robust AMR surveillance system, and existing data are fragmented, retrospective, and primarily limited to a few tertiary care centers [10,11]. Although steps have been taken, such as joining the WHO’s Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) and drafting a National Action Plan (NAP), implementation has been hindered by political instability, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficient funding [12,19,20]. These gaps in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) mirror challenges faced by other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For instance, recent studies from tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan reported poor adherence to the CDC’s Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship, particularly in the areas of tracking and reporting antibiotic use, as well as clinician and patient education [50,51]. These findings highlight the global difficulty of optimizing antibiotic use, especially in resource-limited settings where AMS programs remain underdeveloped [52–56].

The multivariate regression analysis identified three main risk factors significantly associated with the ‎acquisition of DTRP. aeruginosainfections. Notably, the winter season was significantly associated with DTRP. aeruginosainfections compared to the summer season. This finding aligns with a retrospective observational study conducted in China, which identified seasonality as a risk factor for acquiring CRPA. In that study, isolates collected during the winter were more likely to be carbapenem-resistant than those collected during the summer [30]. Similarly, another retrospective observational cohort study identified that winter season as a risk factor for the development of nosocomial pneumonia caused by MDR bacteria [28]. However, contrasting findings were reported by Kito et al., who investigated the seasonal variation in the prevalence of Gram-negative bacilli. They found that the prevalence ofP. aeruginosawas highest during the summer season (P< 0.01) and detected a significant positive correlation between monthly temperature and humidity and the frequency ofP. aeruginosaisolation from sputum specimens (P< 0.001) [10].P. aeruginosatypically thrives at temperatures around 37 °C and in humid environments [26].

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the winter season as a predictor of DTRP. aeruginosainfections. The seasonal effect on DTRP. aeruginosais not well understood, but it may be influenced by several factors. During winter, the outbreak of respiratory infections and the increased use or misuse of antibiotics can select for resistant strains, contributing to a higher prevalence of AMR. Additionally, indoor conditions in healthcare settings, such as reduced ventilation and indoor heating, may create environments where the bacteria can persist and spread. The strains that become resistant to antibiotics may exhibit different seasonal dynamics, thriving in these winter-specific conditions. The surge in hospital admissions during this time may further elevate the risk of hospital-acquired infections [57,58]. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and to reconcile these findings with existing knowledge.

This study found that infections acquired in the ICU were 2.5 times more likely to be associated with DTR strains compared to those acquired in other settings. Similarly, previous studies have also recognized ICU stay as an independent risk factor for infection with MDRP. aeruginosa[25,27]. For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis identified ICU stays—whether during the current infection episode or prior—as a significant predictor of acquiring MDR or XDRP. aeruginosa, with an AOR of 2.2 [32]. The increased risk of acquiring DTR strains during an ICU stay can be attributed to several key factors. First, the higher severity of illnesses in ICU patients often necessitates more aggressive treatments, including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can promote the selection of resistant strains. Additionally, the frequent use of invasive medical devices provides entry points for bacteria and facilitates the development of biofilms, where resistant bacteria can thrive. The ICU environment itself, with its high density of critically ill patients and the intensive use of antibiotics, creates a breeding ground for MDR pathogens, contributing to their emergence and spread among patients [25,27,32]. These findings emphasize the need for stringent infection control measures in the ICU, including rigorous protocols among healthcare practitioners, to prevent the acquisition and spread of resistant strains. Additionally, they highlight the critical importance of careful antibiotic selection and stewardship in hospital settings to minimize the development of resistance.

This study found that respiratory tract infections were more likely to be associated with the acquisition of DTRP. aeruginosa. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that the respiratory tract is the most common source of MDRP. aeruginosainfections, accounting for 60.3% of cases [59].P. aeruginosafrequently colonizes the tracheobronchial tract, particularly in patients with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and bronchiectasis. These patients often have a reduced ability to clear respiratory secretions, weakened natural production of antibacterial peptides, and compromised immune defenses, all of which promote bacterial colonization and resistance [10]. Moreover,P. aeruginosais among the leading pathogens in healthcare-associated respiratory infections and has developed resistance to multiple drug classes [60]. Several risk factors contribute to DTRP. aeruginosarespiratory infections, including prior antibiotic use, underlying lung conditions, previous corticosteroid use, immunosuppression, biofilm formation on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and medical devices like ventilators and endotracheal tubes, and cross-transmission of resistant strains among patients [10,24,60]. Based on these findings, it is essential to promptly screen and diagnose high-risk patients with respiratory tract infections for potential DTRP. aeruginosato initiate timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Additionally, implementing strict infection control measures in hospital settings, including reducing the use of invasive medical devices and preventing cross-transmission of resistant pathogens, is crucial.

The current study has several limitations that must be acknowledged. First, the retrospective design inherently limited our ability to establish causal relationships between identified risk factors and DTRP. aeruginosainfections. While we employed multivariate logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders, the absence of a prospective framework introduced ambiguity in the temporality of exposure and outcome. Additionally, the lack of a control group further restricted our capacity to verify associations and control for all sources of bias.

Second, the exclusive reliance on medical records for data retrieval may have resulted in missing or incomplete vital information not documented in patient files, which could have compromised the depth of our analysis and increased the risk of recall bias.

Third, the study’s focus on four tertiary care centers in Beirut introduces a geographic limitation, raising concerns about the generalizability of the incidence estimates to other hospitals across Lebanon.

Fourth, the exclusion of pediatric patients limits the generalizability of our findings to adult populations only, as risk factors may differ significantly in children.

Fifth, by including only the first infection episode per patient and excluding recurrent, polymicrobial, and co-infections, the study may have introduced a bias toward less complex cases. This approach could have overlooked the multifaceted nature of infections commonly encountered in clinical practice, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings.

Finally, the lack of documentation of molecular typing data in the patients’ medical charts restricted our ability to identify specific resistant enzymes, determine the exact mechanisms of resistance, and accurately assess resistance rates.

To address these limitations, future research should involve prospective, multicenter cohort studies conducted over several years, incorporating standardized data collection methods and molecular characterization of isolates. Such studies would offer a more comprehensive estimate of the national incidence of DTRP. aeruginosainfections, allow for effective tracking of resistance trends, and enhance control of confounding factors while more reliably identifying associated risk factors.

The incidence of DTRP. aeruginosain Lebanese hospitals is substantial compared to the global rates and poses a significant challenge to effective treatment. Therefore, urgent and coordinated measures are required to prevent and manage the spread of DTRP. aeruginosainfections. Strengthening hospital-based AMS and infection prevention and control programs is essential, alongside implementing community-based initiatives to promote the rational use of antibiotics.

At the policy level, addressing AMR in Lebanon requires formally integrating it into the national health agenda, supported by a dedicated budget and sustainable infrastructure. A nationwide AMR surveillance system should be established to generate real-time, high-quality data to guide evidence-based interventions. Additionally, regulatory oversight on antibiotic prescribing and infection control practices must be enforced. The development and dissemination of national treatment guidelines tailored to local susceptibility patterns are also vital to ensure consistent and effective clinical decision-making.

Future research should focus on assessing both the implementation and effectiveness of AMS interventions, exploring molecular mechanisms of resistance, and monitoring resistance patterns through well-designed multicenter longitudinal studies.
