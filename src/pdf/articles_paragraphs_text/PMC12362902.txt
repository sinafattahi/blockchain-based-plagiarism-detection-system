The Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein (NRAMP) family consists of integral membrane transporters essential for divalent metal ion transport in plants. This study aimed to identify and characterize NRAMP genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), performing genome-wide classification, and cis-elements analysis, revealing four SlNRAMP genes in the tomato genome. Phylogenetic analysis classified the four SlNRAMP proteins into two distinct groups, group A and group B. The encoded proteins ranged in length from 509 amino acids inSlNRAMP3to 773 amino acids inSlNRAMP4. The number of predicted transmembrane domains in SlNRAMPs ranged from 12 to 14. Expression analysis in 20 samples from three key developmental stages were collected for metabolic profiling and RNA-seq, revealing that group A genes, includingSlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP2, were predominantly expressed in flowers and mature roots, while group B genes, includingSlNRAMP3andSlNRAMP4, exhibited relatively high expression in leaves and roots, respectively. TheSlEIN2gene, previously misclassified asSlNRAMP5, has now been reassigned to a separate category. Quantitative RT‒PCR analysis demonstrated differential regulation of SlNRAMP expression in roots under cadmium and salt stress. The results highlighted thatSlNRAMP4is critical for cadmium sensitivity, whereasSlNRAMP2plays a role in the early detection and signaling of NaCl stress. This study provides a detailed characterization of theSlNRAMPfamily in tomato, advancing our understanding of their roles in metal ion homeostasis and stress responses, while serving as a valuable resource for future research.

With the rapid progression of industrialization and urbanization, approximately 25% of cultivated soils in China have been contaminated by heavy metals [1]. Cadmium (Cd) is the most serious and common inorganic pollutant in China. The concentration of cadmium naturally ranges from 0.01 to 0.7 mg kg−1in agrarian soils [2], and it is a highly biologically toxic and mobile heavy metal [3–5]. It is widely distributed in the environment as a toxic and carcinogenic pollutant [6]. When its concentration and spread in soil exceed safe levels, cadmium can harm soil microorganisms, disrupt the soil ecosystem, and inhibit metabolic processes, such as reducing plant photosynthesis and damaging membrane integrity [7]. These effects ultimately lead to severe consequences, including stunted plant growth, decreased crop yield and quality, and pose a threat to human health as it accumulates in the food chain [8].

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicumL.) is an important horticultural crop [9]. It is sensitive to soil heavy metal pollution and can accumulate cadmium. Cadmium can be easily absorbed by the roots of tomato plants, and as the plants grow, it accumulates and affects various physiological functions, such as photosynthesis and respiration [10]. In severe cases, cadmium can inhibit tomato growth and even lead to plant death [11]. However, few studies have examined the effects of cadmium on the physiological changes and metabolism of tomatoes. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying cadmium uptake and transport in tomatoes is essential.

Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMPs) have been reported in various plants, such asArabidopsis thaliana[12], rice [13], brassica [14], potato [15], tobacco [16],Theobroma cacao[17], and tea [18]. These are essential membrane transporters with highly conserved transmembrane domains (TMDs) [19]. Typically, NRAMPs, which are polypeptides exhibiting quintessential membrane-integrated protein characteristics, possess 10 to 12 transmembrane domains conducive to the transport of heavy metal ions across the membrane [20]. Their sequences are highly conserved, and their secondary structure is similar across species, consisting mainly of random coils, α-helices, extended strands, and β-turns, with α-helices accounting for a relatively high proportion; however, plant NRAMP sequences exhibit a high degree of conservation, which may be related to their tertiary LeuT-fold structure [21]. Notably, in the process of plant evolution, there may be a reduction in the number of NRAMP gene family members, as suggested by evolutionary analyses and chromosome mapping [14].

Various studies have investigated the response of NRAMPs to heavy metal stress, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) [20,22]. However, the functions of NRAMPs can differ across plant species. In rice,OsNRAMP5plays a crucial role in Cd uptake [13,23], and mutations in this gene can greatly reduce Cd absorption [24]. NRAMP5 transporters may also interact with other members of the NRAMP gene family [17]. TheAtNRAMP3gene is also essential for the transport and sensitivity of plants to Cd [25,26]. Modification ofAtNRAMP6likely affects the distribution and availability of cadmium within the cellular environment [27,28]. Overexpression ofSaNRAMP1in tobacco has been shown to significantly increase Cd accumulation [29]. InBrassica napusandSpirodela polyrhiza, elevated Cd concentrations are associated with reduced expression of most NRAMPs [14,30]. In contrast, a reverse trend was observed inGlycine maxL., where the expression levels of most NRAMPs increased as Cd concentration rose [31].

Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of the NRAMP family of transition metal transporters, which facilitate the uptake and trafficking of essential micronutrients [32], such as manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), playing crucial roles in the distribution and balance of metal ions within the plant [33,34]. In the model plantArabidopsis thaliana, AtNRAMPs are responsible for efficient transport of Mn and Fe [12,33], while inMedicago truncatula,MtNramp1serves as the key transporter for apoplastic Fe uptake in rhizobia-containing cells [35]. TheOsNRAMP4transporter is particularly notable for its ability to transport aluminum (Al) [36], contributing to improved tolerance to adverse conditions [35]. Interestingly, NRAMP proteins have multifaceted roles beyond metal ion transport [37]. Impairment ofOsNRAMP6function confers enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus in rice plants, suggesting thatOsNRAMP6acts as a negative regulator of rice immunity against pathogen infection [38]. In addition,AtNRAMP3andAtNRAMP4inArabidopsishave been found to confer resistance againstErwinia chrysanthemums[39]. The NRAMP family is also associated with salt stress responses. NRAMP genes may facilitate the transport of sodium and other ions under NaCl stress, aiding in salinity management. Studies onHKT2;1andHKT2;2/1transporters inOryza sativaunderscore the importance of ion selectivity and transport under salinity [40,41]. The upregulation of certain NRAMP genes under NaCl stress could increase the compartmentalization or exclusion of sodium ions, mitigating salt toxicity. While mechanisms may vary across species and conditions, current research suggests that NRAMP genes play a role in plant adaptation to saline environments, potentially through the regulation of plant hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which are key in abiotic stress responses, as indicated by cis-acting element analysis [14]. Further research is needed to clarify the functions of these genes and their potential role in salt tolerance in plants.

This study utilized the recently published tomato genome to identify four NRAMP genes, aimed to identify and characterize NRAMP homologs via genome-wide bioinformatics (including phylogenetic clustering, gene structure, and motif analysis), re-annotateSlEIN2(previously misassigned asSlNRAMP5) through sequence homology and domain analysis. Given the correlation between Cd stress and salt stress and that salt stress can induce the detoxification of cadmium [42], the precise role of NRAMP proteins in tomato plants in response to cadmium and salt stress remains unclear. We then profiled SlNRAMP expression across developmental stages and tissues using qRT-PCR, validating stress-responsive expression of SlNRAMP genes in roots under cadmium and salt stress, thereby establishing a mechanistic framework for their roles in metal detoxification and osmotic signaling to inform crop improvement. These findings might be critical for identifying potential plant breeding genes for the agrarian sector.

The amino acid sequences of proteins from cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicumcv. Variety) were retrieved from Phytozome (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Slycopersicum_ITAG5_0), genome size 801.8 Mb. Corresponding NRAMP genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), potato (Solanum tuberosum), soybean (Glycine max) and maize (Zea mays) were sourced from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The hidden Markov model (HMM) of the NRAMP domain (PF01566) was obtained from InterPro (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).

The NRAMP genes in cultivated tomato were identified via the HMMER search program (http://hmmer.janelia.org/, Version 3.0) with an E value less than 10−5, an NCBI BlastP E value less than 10−5, and the CDD software program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi). The total number of amino acids, molecular weight (MW), and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) were determined via the Compute pI/MW tool ExPASy (http://web.ExPASy.org/protparam/) and TBtools software [43,44]. Predictions of protein subcellular localization and the presence of transmembrane helices were performed via the ProtComp 9.0 tool (ProtComp - Predict the subcellular localization for plant proteins, Softberry) and Euk-Mploc tool (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi2/).

Multiple alignments of selected full-length amino acid sequences were aligned with default parameters via MAFFT v7 [45]. TrimAl was used to trim the aligned results [46], and FastTree was used for treeing [47]. iTOL was used to construct the phylogenetic tree (https://itol.embl.de) [48]. The syntenic relationships of the SlNRAMPs were calculated via TBtools [44]. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of the SlNRAMP family in various tissues and organs of tomato was carried out via the online TomExpress platform (http://gbf.toulouse.inra.fr/tomexpress) [49].

The MEME Suite (https://meme-suite.org/meme/db/motifs) was used to analyse conserved motifs [50]. NRAMP family locations on chromosomes were drawn via TBtools. The plant cis-elements database PlantCARE (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/) was used to obtain the cis-elements [51]. The PPI networks of the SlNRAMPs and other proteins were generated via the STRING database (http://string-db.org/) [52] and redrawn via Cytoscape software [53], with a confidence interaction score of 0.4. The best crystal structure was selected as the template for 3D structure modelling in the SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) template library [54].

Tomato was used for expression analysis under Cd and salt (NaCl) stress. Tomato seeds were cultured in soil for 21 days, and one seedling was placed in one pot with 16 h light (350 µmol m−2s−1light intensity, 28 °C) and 8 h darkness (28 °C) in a plant growth room in Guangzhou, China. The 21-day-old seedlings were cultivated with 20 mL of water supplemented with CdCl22H2O and NaCl (China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.) to a final concentration of 100 µM Cd and 100 mM NaCl for 0 h (CK), 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h in one pot [55,56]. The leaves were sampled, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Each treatment was independently replicated three times.

Total RNA extraction was carried out using Promega RNA extraction kit, and PrimeScript and RT reagent with gDNA eraser kit for cDNA synthesis. qRT‒PCR was performed on a LightCycler 96 (Roche). The 10 µL reaction mixture contained 5 µL of 2× SYBR Green Mix, 2 µL of cDNA, 0.5 µL of forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 1), and 2 µL of double distilled water (ddH2O).SlACTwas used as a reference gene. The results were calculated via the 2−ΔΔCtmethod. Each treatment has three independent biological replications. The experiment was performed using three biological replications.

The data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with post-hoc comparisons between treatments conducted using the LSD test (p< 0.05). All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.0 and Statistix 8.1 software (www.statistix.com).

The present study successfully identified four SlNRAMP genes. The encoded proteins varied in length, ranging from 509 amino acids (SlNRAMP3) to 773 amino acids (SlNRAMP4). The maximum theoretical isoelectric point (PI) ranged from 5.61 (SlNRAMP3) andSlNRAMP4to 9.35 (SlNRAMP1). The number of predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) in SlNRAMPs ranged from 12 to 14 (Table1). Protein localization in cells is directly linked to protein function, making the prediction of protein cellular localization essential for understanding gene function. With the exception ofSlEIN2,which ispredicted to localize on Chloroplas, the SlNRAMP proteins are localized to the cell membrane (Table S1).

Evolutionary analysis is key for studying gene function, evolutionary relationships among species, and genetic diversity and variation. We constructed a phylogenetic tree via six NRAMP genes and one EIN2 gene fromArabidopsis thaliana, six NRAMP genes and five EIN2 genes fromOryza sativa, five NRAMP genes and one EIN2 gene fromSolanum tuberosum, thirteen NRAMP genes and three fromGlycine maxand five NRAMP genes and two EIN2 genes fromZea maysfor evolutionary relationships (Fig.1). The four SlNRAMP proteins from tomato were classified into two groups (A and B), consistent with the classification of AtNRAMPs. Sequence alignment revealed high sequence identity (21% identity) between the N-terminus of EIN2 and NRAMP family proteins [57]. TheSlEIN2gene clustered in EIN2 group, exhibiting high amino acid sequence similarity to orthologs in other plant species. Notably, SlNRAMP genes exhibited significant sequence similarity with StNRAMPs.

Gene structure analysis revealed thatSlEIN2had the longest length of 1316 amino acids (aa), whereasSlNRAMP3had the shortest length of 509 aa (Table1; Fig.2). A total of four SlNRAMP proteins were investigated, and nine conserved motifs were identified. Notably, significant differences were observed among the groups (Fig.2). Specifically,SlNRAMP1contains all the motifs (motif 3, motif 2, motif 5, motif 8, motif 4, motif 7, motif 1, motif 6, and motif 9), whileSlNRAMP2,SlNRAMP3andSlNRAMP4also share these motifs. In contrast,SlEIN2has only motif 3, motif 2, motif 4, motif 1 and motif 6. While the motifs within each branch displayed similar characteristics, notable variations were observed in theSlEIN2group compared to the other groups. We focused on the conserved domain of the NRAMP protein (Fig.2B), and conserved motifs were obtained using MEME to clarify and define the sequence features of the SlNRAMPs. The structure ofSlEIN2differs from that of the other SlNRAMP genes. Similar results were also observed for the distribution of gene CDS and UTR regions (Fig.2C).

The three-dimensional structures of these SlNRAMP proteins were predicted via homology modelling. Notably, changes in the three-dimensional architectures of the four proteins were detected, as shown in Fig.3. These structural predictions provide a foundation for understanding the biological functions. InSlNRAMP1,SlNRAMP2,SlNRAMP3, andSlNRAMP4, distinct patterns of coiling and folding structures are evident, whereasSlEIN2shows a relatively lower proportion of coiled regions.

Cis-regulatory elements in the promoter regions of NRAMP genes were analysed to assess their potential activities in tomato. This involved examining the 2000 upstream base pairs of the NRAMP genes. Our study identified multiple cis-regulatory elements that play critical roles in regulating hormonal and light responses, as shown in Fig.4. A total of 16 functional cis-regulatory elements were found in these four SlNRAMP genes and 1SlEIN2gene. These elements include ABA, auxin, ethylene, gibberellin, salicylic acid and MeJA (methyl jasmonate). Notably, a salicylic acid-responsive element was identified inSlEIN2, and an auxin responsive element was found inSlNRAMP1. Additionally, five genes were found to contain elements that are crucial for stress and growth. Stress-related elements, such as anaerobic, dehydration, drought, low-temperature and wounding elements, especially dehydration and low-temperature responsive elements, were found inSlNRAMP4. Most of the cis-acting elements linked to SlNRAMP are linked to growth-related processes, such as circadian control, meristem expression, morphology development and zein metabolism regulatory elements, particularly inSlNRAMP3andSlEIN2. These findings suggest that SlNRAMP genes play a significant role in tomato growth through signalling networks that govern various developmental processes and response to both biotic and abiotic stresses.

Protein‒protein interactions (PPIs) were projected via the STRING tool. A total of 34 genes were identified, with disconnected nodes obscured from the network visualization. Nodes with higher connectivity are considered more critical for the stability of the entire network. Consequently, we focussed on identifying these key genes and utilized Cytoscape software to refine the PPI network. Genes associated withSlNRAMP3,SlNRAMP4, andSlEIN2exhibited higher connectivity, each with 10 connections genes, followed bySlNRAMP1, with only a single gene interacting withSlNRAMP2(Table2; Fig.5). The functions ofSlNRAMP1,SlNRAMP2,SlNRAMP3,SlNRAMP4andSlEIN2are metal ion SLC transporters, manganese ion transmembrane transport, manganese ion transmembrane transporter activity, ferric-chelate reductase activity, and the ethylene-activated signalling pathway, respectively.

Our investigation into the evolutionary mechanisms of the SlNRAMP gene family revealed that the distribution of the five genes was not uniform across 12 chromosomes in the tomato.SlNRAMP1was located on chromosome 3, whileSlNRAMP2was found on chromosome 11. TheSlNRAMP3gene is situated on chromosome 2, andSlNRAMP4andSIEIN2are distributed on chromosome 4 and chromosome 9, respectively. (Fig.6A). Within the tomato genome, a pair of paralogous genes,SlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP4, were detected on the same chromosome (Fig.6B), suggesting a segmental duplication role in the expansion of the SlNRAMP gene family. Furthermore, to elucidate the origin and functional divergence of the SlNRAMP gene family, a comparative collinearity analysis was conducted for NRAMP genes between the tomato andArabidopsis. A total of seven pairs of NRAMP genes were identified in both tomato andArabidopsis(Fig.6C), indicating a high degree of homology and conservation of NRAMP genes across these species.

To elucidate the expression patterns of SlNRAMP genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a comprehensive analysis was conducted across various plant tissues. The results revealed distinct transcript accumulation for each gene.SlNRAMP1was significantly expressed in flower, root, and fruit, with the highest levels observed in flowers.SlNRAMP2presented increased transcription in mature root tissues.SlNRAMP3had substantial transcript abundance in both leaf and root tissues.SlNRAMP4andSlEIN2exhibited high expression levels in roots and fruits; however,SlNRAMP4was more predominant in roots, whereasSlEIN2was more predominant in fruits. Notably, the transcript levels ofSlNRAMP1,SlNRAMP2,SlNRAMP4, andSlEIN2were generally greater than those ofSlNRAMP3across all the plant tissues examined. Based on these findings, we can better understand how various organs in tomato plants regulate metal ion homeostasis through the SlNRAMP gene family (Fig.7).

To examine variations in SlNRAMP gene expression in tomato in response to early Cd and salt stress. The first true-leaf unfolded tomato leaves were treated with Cd and NaCl, and the expression of four potential transport genes in the tomato roots were assessed via RT‒PCR at various time points (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h) following cadmium treatment. The expression of theSlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP2genes initially increased but then decreased after heavy metal exposure, with maximum expression ofSlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP2genes observed after 8 h, after which they declined. The maximum expression ofSlNRAMP3occurred at 24 h, whileSlNRAMP4reached its peak at 1 h. However, the expression of theSlNRAMP3andSlNRAMP4genes fluctuated over time. Under Cd treatment, the four genes exhibited distinct response patterns (Fig.8).

To elucidate the role ofSlNRAMPgenes in salt stress response, samples were collected at defined time intervals (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h) post-treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed distinct expression patterns among the fourSlNRAMPgenes under salt stress conditions.SlNRAMP2exhibited transient upregulation at 2 h, followed by rapid downregulation after 4 h, indicating its potential role in early salt stress adaptation. In contrast,SlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP4demonstrated sustained responses, reaching peak expression at 4 and 12 h, respectively, before gradually declining. These differential expression profiles suggest specialized temporal roles forSlNRAMPgenes in the tomato salt stress response. In fact,SlNRAMP4expression decreased significantly at 24 h, indicating its functional role during the middle phase of salt stress. The expression ofSlNRAMP3remained stable, with a slight decrease at 4 h after salt treatment (Fig.9).

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing metal uptake and translocation is crucial to understanding plant nutrition and stress responses. While NRAMP transporters have been linked to cadmium absorption in certain species [25,58,59] and the uptake of other metal ions [60,61], advancements in this family remain limited, particularly in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). In this study, we identified four SlNRAMP genes (SlNRAMP1-4) and oneSlEIN2gene in tomato. Sequence analysis revealed variation in protein lengths among the five genes, withSlNRAMP4encoding the longest polypeptide (773 amino acids) and SlNRAMP3 the shortest (509 amino acids) (Table1). These findings diverged from the observed diversity patterns reported in a previous tomato NRAMP study [11]. Chromosome-scale genome assembly localizes NRAMP gene positions on chromosomes, and these five genes are distributed across five different chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis classified the NRAMP and EIN2 genes from six eudicot and monocot species resolved three major clades: Group A (SlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP2); Group B (SlNRAMP3andSlNRAMP4); and EIN2 clade (SlEIN2). Consistent withArabidopsis thaliana[14,26], the tomato NRAMP family was subdivided into two subfamilies (Fig.1). Notably, the four SlNRAMP proteins from tomato exhibited sequence similarity to potato StNRAMPs, a finding aligned with their shared taxonomic membership in the Solanaceae family. These suggests conserved evolutionary relationships among NRAMP homologs in solanaceous crops. These integrated findings provide a foundation for dissecting NRAMP-mediated metal transport mechanisms in solanaceous species.

Functionally, the subcellular localization and sequence features of SlNRAMPs suggest potential roles in ion homeostasis. Notably,SlEIN2, previously misclassified asSlNRAMP5and assigned to the NRAMP family [62], has been reclassified through phylogenetic analysis (Fig.1), conserved domain (Fig.2B) and predicted 3D structure (Fig.3), which confirm its exclusion from the NRAMP NRAMP clade. Despite its sequence alignment with NRAMP family proteins,SlEIN2clusters exclusively within the EIN2 lineage, supported by its low N-terminal identity (21%) with both EIN2 and NRAMP homologs [57]. Structural divergence is further accentuated by the unique motif combination ofSlEIN2(motif 3, motif 2, motif 4, motif 1, and motif 6) and distinct coding and untranslated regions (CDSs and UTRs) (Fig.2C), which differentiate it from SlNRAMPs. These findings align with functional studies showing that EIN2 does not mediate ion transport but instead acts through ethylene signaling pathways [57]. Transcriptome analysis highlightsSlEIN2as a key regulator of fruit ripening during tomato fruit ripening, influencing the expression of genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis, signal transduction, and defense pathways [63]. Silencing ofSlEIN2results in a non-ripening phenotype and significant variations in the regulation of more than 4,000 genes, underscoring its central role in ethylene signalling. Additionally, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified hub proteins in the SlNRAMP (Table2), providing insights into their potential functional networks. In summary, whileSlEIN2exhibits limited homology to NRAMP family, it exhibits distinct characteristics that suggest a unique functional role in tomato.

The analysis of the conserved motifs and domains of SlNRAMPs helps predict protein roles and clarifies the relationship between protein structure and function. These findings suggest that the combination of motifs (motif 3, motif 2, motif 5, motif 8, motif 4, motif 7, motif 1, motif 6, and motif 9) is essential for the proper functioning of NRAMP proteins, as they are consistently found across these four NRAMP genes (Fig.2A). Notably, the consensus transport motif (CTM) between TMD8 and TMD9 is characterized by the conserved sequence GQSSTxTGTYAGQxxQGFLx inArabidopsis thaliana, and rice (Oryza sativa)—is highly conserved suggesting its critical role in the evolutionary retention of NRAMPs’ metal ion transport function [32].

Most SlNRAMP promoters contain response elements for ABA, jasmonic acid (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxins, indicating possible hormonal regulation pathways (Fig.4). Previous studies have shown that plant hormones such as ABA, MeJA, and SA play a role in the plant response to various metal stressors [64]. However, the overall sensitivity of NRAMPs to these hormones and stress treatments can be rather poor, such as BnNRAMPs in rapeseed [14]. Whether the same phenomenon occurs in tomatoes requires further examination. In fact, the modulation ofStNRAMP5expression in hot peppers to increase root absorption of Cd, as well as the upregulation of genes such asNIR1,GLN1, andIAA9to combat Cd toxicity and restrict its translocation to the above-ground parts, is a strategy that has been reported in recent studies [65]. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of various transcription factors, including those in the MYB family, in regulating plant responses to Cd stress [66]. This research points to the possibility thatIAA9, a gene involved in auxin signalling, might be part of a larger transcriptional regulatory network that modulates plant tolerance to heavy metals such as Cd. These genes likely work in concert to increase the ability of plants to absorb essential nutrients, modulate hormone signalling, and alter metal ion transport and compartmentalization.

Recent studies have provided insights into the intricate relationship between heavy metal stress (e.g. Cd) and gene expression dynamics [11,34]. To characterize NRAMP gene function in tomato, we analyzed the expression profiles of SlNRAMPs under Cd stress, revealing distinct response patterns among family members.SlNRAMP1andSlNRAMP2’s response to Cd stress was characterized by initial upregulation, followed by a decrease after peaking at 8 h. Notably,SlNRAMP2exhibited a slower upregulation, indicating that this gene exhibited increased transcription in mature root tissues, as described in the expression patterns across various tissue types (Fig.7). This tissue-specific NRAMP expression likely reflects evolutionary adaptation to distinct ecological niches. Leaf-preferential expression ofSlNRAMP3may have evolved as an adaptive strategy to sequester or detoxify airborne heavy metals deposited via foliar uptake, particularly in environments with atmospheric contamination. Conversely, root-biased expression profiles are consistent with the primary role of roots in scavenging essential micronutrients from soil while mitigating toxic metal influx. In addition,SlNRAMP3exhibited delayed peak expression at 24 h, exemplifying the complex regulatory mechanisms by which plants maintain metal ion homeostasis. This pattern is similar to the expression ofStNRAMP3in potato [15]. It likely reflects adaptive mechanisms for prolonged metal ion sequestration or efflux to prevent immediate cellular damage, consistent with the conserved function of NRAMPs in divalent cations transport, potentially facilitating the sequestration or detoxification of Cd when taken up by the plant [67]. The most striking finding was the rapid induction ofSlNRAMP4, which reached maximal expression within one hour of Cd treatment (Fig.8). This rapid upregulation distinguishesSlNRAMP4from other family members and suggests a critical role in early Cd sensitivity, potentially involved in early Cd sensing or defense activation. Comparative analysis across species highlights its uniqueness, inSpirodela polyrhiza,SpNramp3expression was downregulated; however, after an adaptive period,SpNRAMP3was transiently upregulated in the plant [30]. NRAMPs exhibit different behaviours inArabidopsisand other plants; whereas the expression levels ofAtNRAMP6,SpNRAMP2, andMaNRAMP1are downregulated under stress, those ofOsNRAMP1andTtNRAMP6are upregulated [25,68],SlNRAMP4’s rapid response resembles stress-responsive genes in metal hyperaccumulators. This may indicate an evolutionarily specialized function in tomato for immediate Cd detoxification or signaling, potentially via direct involvement in initial metal uptake or stress transduction pathways, and also may involve various signalling pathways and transcription factors [27,30,69]. Collectively, these findings suggest that the functional diversification of of SlNRAMPs, withSlNRAMP4emerging as a key early Cd stress marker, highlighting the adaptive evolution of NRAMP-mediated metal homeostasis mechanisms via cross-species expression divergence.

The temporal expression patterns of SlNRAMP genes suggest specific roles in salt stress response dynamics.SlNRAMP2is likely involved in initial stress detection and signalling, whileSlNRAMP1,SlNRAMP3, andSlNRAMP4potentially contribute to sustained stress tolerance and recovery (Fig.9). This research underscores the role of SlNRAMP genes in the tomato defense mechanism against salt stress, highlighting their initial upregulation as part of the rapid response to metal influx, followed by downregulation as the plant shifts to longer-term adaptation strategies.

Given the complex expression regulatory mechanisms of NRAMPs under heavy metal Cd stress and their widely studied transport functions for multiple metal elements, NRAMPs have not evolved to distinguish between harmful heavy metals and essential micronutrients. Thus, elucidating their molecular mechanisms is crucial for precision breeding. In genetic improvement, focusing on gene locus-specific regulation, hormone response pathways, and conformational changes of NRAMPs will facilitate targeted modulation of metal homeostasis under cadmium and salt stress, ensuring crop performance across diverse stressful growth conditions.

In this study, fourSlNRAMPgenes and oneSlEIN2gene were identified in tomatoes, each encoding proteins of varying lengths. Initially thought to belong to the NRAMP family,SlEIN2was reclassified due to its distinct characteristics and lack of ion transport function. Instead, it plays a specialized role in ethylene signaling during tomato ripening. Phylogenetic analysis categorized theSlNRAMPgenes into two subfamilies, consistent with those inArabidopsis thaliana, and revealed sequence similarity withStNRAMPgenes in potato, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved relationship. Under cadmium stress, the expression patterns ofSlNRAMPgenes varied, pointing to complex regulatory mechanisms governing metal ion homeostasis. Notably,SlNRAMP4exhibited a rapid response to cadmium, indicating its potential role in early detection and defense activation. Additionally, these genes displayed distinct responses to salt stress, characterized by initial upregulation followed by downregulation, reflecting the plant’s adaptive strategy. These findings enhance our understanding of the functional diversity and regulatory dynamics ofSlNRAMPgenes in metal homeostasis and stress responses in tomatoes.
