Isolated talonavicular arthritis is relatively uncommon and remains understudied. Furthermore, the alterations in plantar pressure distribution (PPD) following isolated talonavicular arthrodesis (TNA) have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate PPD, clinical outcomes, and radiographic changes in patients undergoing unilateral isolated TNA.

Fifteen patients (63.2 ± 11.4 years) who underwent isolated unilateral TNA performed by a single surgeon were included. Postoperative PPD was evaluated across five foot regions at a mean follow-up of 33.3 ± 13.0 months, with comparisons made to the contralateral, unaffected foot. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Foot Function Index (FFI). Radiographic evaluation included measurements of Meary’s angle (MA), talonavicular coverage angle (TCA), and talus-first metatarsal angle (T1MA). Preoperative and postoperative data for these variables were compared to analyze surgical outcomes.

Compared with the unaffected foot, pressure-time integrals (PTIs) in the forefoot, medial sole, and the entire plantar surface were lower on the affected side, while PTIs in the lateral sole, hindfoot, and midfoot were higher, though none reached statistical significance (P> 0.05). Clinically, AOFAS midfoot scores improved from 27.0 ± 21.3 to 78.9 ± 21.0 (P< 0.001), hindfoot scores from 25.1 ± 23.8 to 77.9 ± 14.9 (P< 0.001), and FFI decreased from 54.0% ± 19.8–16.5% ± 15.9% (P< 0.001). Radiographically, the TCA decreased significantly from 12.3° ± 6.3° to 4.7° ± 5.2° (P= 0.002), while changes in MA and T1MA were not significant (P= 0.078 andP= 0.123, respectively). Pedobarographic results on affected sides showed no significant correlation with either preoperative or postoperative AOFAS scores or FFI. However, these scores showed significant correlations with changes in T1MA between preoperative and postoperative assessments. Preoperative T1MA and postoperative MA were significantly associated with PTIs in specific regions of the plantar surface on the affected side. Additionally, BMI was correlated not only with PTIs in certain plantar areas but also with postoperative FFI.

Isolated TNA was associated with improved functional outcomes and trends toward symmetrical PPD during walking on both sides, though larger studies are needed to confirm these observations.

The medial column of the foot comprises the first ray (first metatarsal-medial cuneiform joint) and talonavicular joint, forming a critical functional unit for weight transmission and arch stability [1,2]. Recent weightbearing CT studies demonstrate that the rotational alignment of these structures significantly influences hindfoot mechanics [1], while clinical evidence suggests their kinematic coupling with hindfoot valgus deformities [2]. This anatomical interdependence underscores the importance of precise talonavicular arthrodesis positioning. The talonavicular joint is a critical multiaxial, ball-and-socket articulation that contributes to hindfoot stability and adaptive motion during gait [3]. As part of the medial column complex, it withstands significant multidirectional forces, making it susceptible to degenerative changes from primary osteoarthritis, post-traumatic injury, or systemic inflammatory conditions [3,4]. Talonavicular arthrodesis (TNA), first described by Ogston in 1884 for pediatric pes planovalgus [5], is generally indicated for patients with severe midfoot collapse, significant pain, or deformity that is unresponsive to conservative treatments [4]. This procedure may be performed as an isolated intervention or as part of a double arthrodesis (involving the talonavicular and subtalar joints) or a triple arthrodesis (involving the talonavicular, subtalar, and calcaneocuboid joints) in cases of more extensive deformity. Clinical evidence consistently demonstrates that TNA provides reliable pain relief, improves radiographic alignment parameters, and enhances functional outcomes [6,7]. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that while isolated TNA effectively restores structural integrity to the midfoot, it may not sufficiently correct concomitant deformities such as hindfoot malalignment or subtalar joint pathology, potentially necessitating additional corrective procedures.

Plantar pressure distribution analysis has become an important tool in assessing foot function and evaluating surgical outcomes in foot and ankle procedures [8–12]. Plantar pressure measurement provides valuable insights into the distribution of forces across the foot during weight-bearing activities, helping clinicians identify abnormal pressure patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of surgical interventions. Specifically, in the context of joint fusion procedures such as TNA, plantar pressure analysis can be used to assess changes in load distribution, gait alterations, and the potential for compensatory mechanisms that may develop postoperatively. While studies have demonstrated the utility of plantar pressure measurements in evaluating outcomes following foot surgeries, including double arthrodesis and triple arthrodesis [13–15], the role of these measurements in isolated TNA outcomes remains underexplored and warrants further investigation.

While the outcomes of TNA for various conditions are well-documented [6,7], isolated talonavicular osteoarthritis (TNOA) remains a rare and underexplored condition, with few studies specifically focusing on the outcomes of isolated TNA for this indication [16–19]. This retrospective study was designed to achieve three principal aims: (1) to quantitatively evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of isolated TNA for isolated TNOA, (2) to characterize postoperative alterations in plantar pressure distribution patterns, and (3) to examine potential correlations between biomechanical parameters and clinical outcomes that may serve as predictive indicators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation into plantar pressure distribution following isolated TNA for isolated TNOA, addressing a critical gap in the current understanding of postoperative biomechanical adaptations related to this surgical procedure. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing literature by evaluating the safety and efficacy of isolated TNA for isolated TNOA, while also providing preliminary insights into its biomechanical effects on foot function and postoperative recovery.

The isolated TNA was performed performed by the senior author (T.G.) through a direct dorsal approach. After administration of general or spinal anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with a thigh tourniquet applied. A longitudinal dorsal incision was made between the extensor hallucis longus tendon and dorsalis pedis artery, carefully protecting the neurovascular bundle. The talonavicular joint was exposed following capsulotomy. Two K-wires were inserted dorsally into the talus and navicular, followed by joint distraction using a K-wire distractor. Articular cartilage was completely removed using rongeurs and osteotomes, with additional drilling of the subchondral bone to create a favorable fusion bed. When deemed necessary based on intraoperative assessment, either an autogenous iliac crest bone graft or an allogeneic bone substitute was implanted. After provisional fixation with K-wires and confirmation of proper alignment under fluoroscopy, definitive fixation was achieved using a dorsal locking compression plate and additionally secured with one or two hollow lag screws. The wound was closed in layers after meticulous hemostasis.

Postoperatively, patients were instructed to maintain a partial weight bearing of 15 kg using forearm crutches while wearing a walking boot (Walker). Lymphatic drainage was performed immediately after surgery. Passive mobilization of the upper ankle joint outside the walking boot was possible starting in the third week.

As part of the postoperative follow-up examination, gait analysis was performed at the final follow-up using wireless pressure-measuring insoles (medilogic®WLAN insole 10.6.4) on several paths that varied in incline, slope, and surface. From the data collected by the individual pressure sensors, a pressure profile was calculated for the forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot zones, as well as for the lateral, medial, and entire sole, for both the operated and the non-operated extremity.

Regarding the pedobarographic analysis, two methodological strength should be disclosed. Whereas most prior investigations have focused on peak pressure or force-time integrals [20–23], we employed PTIs to evaluate plantar pressure distribution following isolated TNA. This decision was based on its unique capacity to capture cumulative pressure over time in specific regions of the foot, providing a comprehensive measurement of load distribution during the gait cycle while not influenced by the body weight, plantar surface area and size of foot [24]. Another methodological strength of our investigation was the use of the unaffected contralateral foot as an internal control, rather than comparing to normative population data. As highlighted by Horisberger et al. [25] and Schuh et al. [26], using the contralateral foot as a control accounts for patient-specific factors such as gait patterns, body weight distribution, and anatomical variations, thereby minimizing inter-individual variability and providing a more accurate and personalized assessment of the surgical impact on plantar pressure distribution.

At the final follow-up with each patient, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot and midfoot scores were recorded [27]. These outcome measures assess pain, function, hindfoot and midfoot motion, and alignment. The maximum score is 100 points. The Foot Function Index (FFI) was also employed, consisting of 23 self-reported items grouped into three subcategories based on the patient’s values: pain, disability, and activity limitation [28,29]. Patients were asked to rate each item on a scale from 0 (no pain or difficulty) to 10 (the most severe pain or difficulty, requiring assistance) to best describe the condition of their foot over the past week. The final score was recorded as a percentage, obtained by dividing the total score by the maximum possible score (230), with a higher score indicating a worse function.

We obtained anteroposterior and lateral weight-bearing radiographs at each clinical review until the radiographic and clinical union was reached. Successful union was defined by both clinical and radiological criteria: (1) complete resolution of pain during weight-bearing and (2) the presence of bony trabeculae spanning more than half of the joint space, with no visible radiolucent line on lateral and anteroposterior radiographs. Nonunion was diagnosed at 6 months postoperatively based on findings from clinical assessment, plain radiographs, and computed tomography scans [17]. Meary’s angle (MA) was measured on the lateral radiographs, while the talonavicular coverage angle (TCA) and talus-first metatarsal angle (T1MA) were measured on the anteroposterior radiographs. Preoperative and postoperative values for these angles were recorded for comparison.

Continuous variables are presented as means ± standard deviation. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 27.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The normality of differences in AOFAS scores, FFI, and various radiographic measurements between preoperative and postoperative values was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, which indicated a normal distribution. Paired sample t-tests were subsequently applied for comparisons of preoperative and postoperative values. Bilateral plantar pressure distribution data were similarly tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, which confirmed a normal distribution, and Levene’s test indicated equal variances. Independent sample t-tests were then conducted to compare plantar pressure distribution data between the affected and unaffected sides. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Finally, Spearman correlation tests were employed to evaluate the relationships between continuous variables.

To assess the adequacy of our sample size, a post-hoc power analysis was performed using G*Power 3.1 [30]. The observed effect sizes (Cohen’s d for continuous variables) of each outcome were calculated based on the actual mean differences and pooled standard deviations. The analysis was conducted with a two-tailed α level of 0.05 and the sample size ofn= 15, following the study’s paired design (paired t-tests for pre-post comparisons; independent t-tests between affected and unaffected side).

Nonunion and delayed union did not occur in any of the patients. None of the patients experienced a deep infection, a wound breakdown, or a hematoma compared to the unaffected foot, the affected side exhibited lower PTIs in the forefoot, medial sole, and the entire plantar surface. Conversely, PTIs in the lateral sole, hindfoot, and midfoot were higher on the affected side. However, none of these differences reached statistical significance (P> 0.05). Detailed pedobarographic results are presented in Table2; Fig.1, with a typical pedobarographic result illustrated in Fig.2.

Clinically, postoperative AOFAS midfoot scores improved from 27.0 ± 21.3 to 78.9 ± 21.0 (P< 0.001). Five patients (33.3%) achieved an excellent score (90–100), six patients (40.0%) had a good score (75–90), two patients (13.3%) had a fair score (50–74), and two patients (13.3%) had a poor score (< 50). After surgery, AOFAS hindfoot scores improved from 25.1 ± 23.8 to 77.9 ± 14.9 (P< 0.001). Three patients (20.0%) achieved an excellent score, seven patients (46.7%) had a good score, four patients (26.7%) had a fair score, and one patient (6.7%) had a poor score. FFI decreased from 54.0% ± 19.8–16.5% ± 15.9% (P< 0.001). Seven patients (46.7%) were classified as excellent (< 10%), two patients (13.3%) as good (10–20%), five patients (33.3%) as fair (20–40%), and one patient (6.7%) as poor (> 40%). See Table3.

Radiographically, TCAs decreased significantly from 12.3° ± 6.3° to 4.7° ± 5.2° (P= 0.002) after surgery. Although the MAs and T1MAs both decreased from 13.4° ± 7.1° and 15.6° ± 9.6° to 9.8° ± 7.7° and 11.4° ± 7.7°, respectively, these changes were not statistically significant (P= 0.078 andP= 0.123, respectively). See Table3.

Post-hoc power analysis revealed divergent statistical power across outcome measures. While AOFAS, FFI, and TCAs achieved > 99% power to detect large effect sizes (d > 2.0), MAs, T1MAs, and PTIs showed power values below 50%, indicating limited sensitivity to small-to-moderate effects. Detailed Post-hoc power results can be found in Tables2and3.

The Spearman correlation analysis indicated no significant associations between preoperative and postoperative AOFAS hindfoot scores, midfoot scores, or FFI and PTIs in specific regions or the entire plantar surface of the affected side (∣r∣ < 0.39,P> 0.05). However, the changes in T1MAs from preoperative to postoperative assessments demonstrated significant correlations with the changes in FFI (r= 0.525,P= 0.044) and AOFAS hindfoot scores (r= −0.575,P= 0.025). Preoperative T1MAs were significantly correlated with PTIs in the forefoot (r= −0.701,P= 0.004), lateral sole (r= −0.586,P= 0.022), medial soles (r= −0.599,P= 0.018), and the entire plantar surface (r= −0.545,P= 0.036) of the affected side. Postoperative MAs exhibited significant associations with PTIs in the forefoot (r= −0.718,P= 0.003) and medial sole (r= −0.543,P= 0.037) of the affected side. Furthermore, patient BMI was significantly correlated with PTIs in the forefoot (r= 0.568,P= 0.027), lateral sole (r= 0.586,P= 0.022), medial sole (r= 0.625,P= 0.013), and the entire plantar surface (r= 0.696,P= 0.004) of the affected side, as well as with postoperative FFI (r= −0.558,P= 0.031).

This study represents the first comprehensive evaluation of clinical and radiographic outcomes combined with plantar pressure distribution analysis following isolated TNA. Our exploratory data demonstrate that isolated TNA improved clinical outcomes, as evidenced by significant increases in AOFAS midfoot and hindfoot scores and a substantial reduction in FFI, with no major complications observed postoperatively. Additionally, the absence of statistically significant differences in plantar pressure distribution between the affected and unaffected feet, if validated in larger cohorts, might suggest isolated TNA’s capacity to restore near-normal loading patterns during gait, a critical factor in optimizing long-term functional outcomes. These preliminary results contribute to the growing evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of isolated TNA while also offering an early understanding of its postoperative biomechanical effects on the affected foot.

A notable finding of this study is the absence of significant complications, including nonunion, delayed union, deep infections, wound dehiscence, or hematoma. This favorable outcome contrasts previous reports in the literature, where complication rates have ranged from 2.1 to 29.6% for the same procedures [31–33]. Specifically, the reported incidence of nonunion in isolated TNA for AAFD varies between 3% and 10% [34], while midfoot arthrodesis procedures have demonstrated nonunion rates of 5–15% [35]. However, outcomes vary widely across studies. While Vacketta et al. [36] a nonunion rate of 16.2% was observed in their cohort of patients undergoing isolated TNA, Bakaes et al. [32] reported a considerably lower 30-day postoperative complication rate of 2.1% without nonunion cases, which aligns more closely with our findings. The absence of such complications in our study may be attributed to several factors, including the small sample size, which limits the likelihood of observing rare adverse events, and the standardized surgical technique performed by a single experienced surgeon, which may have contributed to consistent and optimal outcomes. Additionally, the progress of surgical techniques and implants, as emphasized by Bakaes et al. [32], likely played a significant role in preventing nonunion. Moreover, Lombardi et al. [37] argued that patient noncompliance seemed to impact postoperative outcomes, so the strict rehabilitation protocol, including an appropriate period of non-weight-bearing, likely further minimized complication risks. However, it is important to recognize that the small sample size and relatively short follow-up period in this study were likely the main factors influencing the observed complication rates. Consequently, future investigations incorporating larger patient cohorts and extended follow-up durations are warranted to validate the generalizability of these findings and establish more definitive conclusions regarding the safety profile of isolated TNA.

Our findings showed no significant differences in PTIs between the affected and unaffected feet across all regions of the plantar surface. The results suggest a trend toward restoration of plantar pressure symmetry following isolated TNA, which aligns with the primary surgical objective for end-stage talonavicular osteoarthritis. Furthermore, these preliminary observations indicate potential normalization of load-bearing patterns, minimizing the risk of compensatory mechanisms leading to secondary pathologies in adjacent joints or soft tissues. Our findings are consistent with those of Rammelt et al. [38], who observed similar restoration of plantar pressure symmetry following subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis, emphasizing the importance of achieving biomechanical balance in postoperative outcomes. Similarly, Schuh et al. [26] reported that plantar pressure distribution was symmetrical in all regions except the forefoot following unilateral tibiotalar arthrodesis. They attributed this to significant pain relief on the operated side, encouraging more balanced use of both feet during gait. At the same time, the observed pressure differences in the forefoot were explained by the restricted plantar flexion after surgery. Therefore, in our study, the absence of significant differences in plantar pressure distribution between the affected and unaffected feet may also be attributed to the improved foot morphology after surgery and the substantial reduction in postoperative pain, which likely facilitated more symmetrical loading patterns. Importantly, while no significant plantar pressure differences were detected in this study, the low statistical power (post-hoc power < 80%) limits definitive interpretation. Hence, the observed trend toward symmetrical loading requires validation in larger cohorts.

The significant improvement in AOFAS midfoot and hindfoot scores, as well as the reduction in FFI, aligns with previous studies demonstrating the effectiveness of TNA in alleviating pain and improving function. Lv et al. [39] reported marked improvements in AOFAS scores, increasing from 32.21 ± 4.0 (range: 22–38) preoperatively to 86.5 ± 2.7 (range: 81–90) postoperatively following TNA, highlighting its role in restoring functional capacity in patients with Müller-Weiss disease. Similarly, Popelka et al. [40] observed an increase in AOFAS score from 48.2 preoperatively to 88.6 at the final postoperative follow-up. Furthermore, studies by Nitta et al. [19]and Arbab et al. [4] also demonstrated that isolated TNA led to significant pain relief and improved patient satisfaction. On the other hand, the reduction in FFI further supports the notion that this procedure enhances overall foot function, which aligns with the findings of Ramírez-Barragán et al. [41] in their study on using isolated TNA to treat planovalgus foot in children with cerebral palsy.

In terms of radiological improvements, our study demonstrated significant correction of TCAs, confirming TNA’s capacity to address structural deformities. However, the radiographic outcomes for MA and T1MA revealed important nuances when compared with existing literature. The substantial TCA reduction in our cohort aligns with previous reports by Ramírez-Barragán et al. [41] (from 37.04° ± 11.11° preoperatively to 2.45° ± 2.5° postoperatively) and Traynor et al. [42] (from 35.0° preoperatively to 4.9° postoperatively), supporting TNA’s efficacy in midfoot realignment. Notably, Traynor et al. [42] also reported significant improvements in MA and T1MA, which were not statistically significant in our cohort (MA: Δ=−3.6°,P= 0.078; T1MA: Δ=−4.2°,P= 0.123). Several methodological factors may explain these discrepancies: First of all, our modest sample size (n= 15) resulted in low post-hoc power (< 50%) for MA/T1MA analyses, increasing type II error risk; Secondly, differences in surgical technique and fixation methods may influence angular corrections; Thirdly, our population with end-stage osteoarthritis may exhibit different biomechanical behavior compared to Traynor’s cohort with flexible deformities [42].

Despite lacking statistical significance, the directional consistency of our MA and T1MA changes with Goh et al.’s findings [17] (MA: Δ = 5.9°; T1MA: Δ = 5.0°) suggests a reproducible biomechanical effect. Importantly, our postoperative values (MA: 9.8°±7.7; T1MA: 11.4°±7.7) fell within the normative ranges established by Lamm et al. [43] for healthy adults (T1MA: 0–18° valgus; MA: 0–15°), indicating potential restoration of physiological alignment. These observations highlight isolated TNA’s reliable correction of TCAs across diverse populations and the need for larger cohort studies to clarify MA and T1MA responsiveness. Nevertheless, we cannot dismiss the possibility that these two parameters may represent less sensitive indicators of isolated TNA’s biomechanical effects, particularly in cases with severe preoperative deformities.

Our correlation analyses identified two key predictors of mid-term functional improvement following TNA. The significant association between T1MA correction and improvements in AOFAS hindfoot scores and FFI suggests that achieving proper talus-first metatarsal alignment may enhance clinical outcomes. This aligns with previous studies demonstrating T1MA’s role in medial column stability [44–46]. Moreover, BMI influenced both postoperative FFI and PTIs in specific plantar regions, reinforcing that weight management should be considered in preoperative counseling. However, neither AOFAS scores nor FFI was found to correlate with postoperative plantar pressure distribution, emphasizing the complexity of biomechanical adaptations following TNA and suggesting further investigation.

Despite the promising findings of our study, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the retrospective study design inherently limits the ability to control for confounding variables and may introduce selection bias. Retrospective studies rely on existing data, which may not capture all relevant preoperative and postoperative variables, potentially affecting the generalizability of our results. Second, the lack of preoperative plantar pressure data represents a significant limitation. Without baseline PTI measurements, it is challenging to fully assess the extent to which TNA altered plantar loading patterns. Preoperative data would have clarified the surgical impact on foot biomechanics and allowed a more robust comparison of pre- and postoperative changes. Future studies should prioritize prospective designs with standardized data collection protocols to address this gap, including pre- and postoperative plantar pressure measurements. Additionally, although the small sample size (n= 15) provided sufficient statistical power (> 99%) to identify clinically significant improvements in AOFAS, FFI, and TCA, it was inadequate to detect more subtle changes in MA, T1MA, or PTIs. The observed trends toward symmetrical loading patterns, while promising, require validation through larger cohort studies to establish their clinical significance and reproducibility. Furthermore, our mean follow-up duration of 33.3 months, while sufficient for demonstrating successful arthrodesis, may be insufficient to evaluate potential long-term degenerative changes in adjacent joints. On the other hand, variability in assessment intervals (range: 14–67 months) could compromise the comparability of postoperative data, as these data were collected at different postoperative time points. Thus, future investigations should incorporate scheduled assessments at 6-, 12-, and 24-month intervals in larger cohorts to establish definitive timelines for postoperative changes. Moreover, integrating advanced imaging techniques, such as weight-bearing computer tomography scans, could provide further insights into structural adaptations following surgery. Finally, developing patient-specific predictive models incorporating factors such as BMI, preoperative alignment, and plantar pressure distribution could also enhance surgical planning and optimize outcomes for individual patients.

Our preliminary findings suggest that isolated TNA may represent a viable treatment option for end-stage talonavicular osteoarthritis, demonstrating trends toward both functional improvement and biomechanical restoration. While the observed clinical outcomes are encouraging, the exploratory nature of our biomechanical data, particularly regarding PTI symmetry, and limited sample size necessitate cautious interpretation. These results provide initial evidence to support further investigation in larger cohorts, which should focus on standardizing surgical techniques and correlating radiographic changes with long-term clinical outcomes.
