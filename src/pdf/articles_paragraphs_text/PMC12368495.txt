The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of teicoplanin associated with optimal outcomes in glycopeptide-susceptibleEnterococcus faecium(GSEF) bacteraemia.

We conducted a retrospective review of GSEF bacteraemia cases treated with teicoplanin between 1 April 2009 and 30 May 2023. Total area under the concentration–time curve over 24 h (AUC24) was calculated using a Bayesian approach. The free AUC24(fAUC24) was estimated based on patient serum albumin levels. MICs were determined using the gradient diffusion method (Etest), and the fAUC24/MICEtestratio was calculated. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as a composite of (i) 30-day all-cause mortality and (ii) microbiological failure, defined as persistent bacteraemia (a positive follow-up blood culture obtained >72 h after initiation of appropriate therapy). Classification and regression tree analysis (CART) was employed to identify the optimal teicoplanin fAUC24/MICEtestvalue associated with treatment failure.

A total of 76 patients were included. Treatment failure occurred in 18 patients (23.7%). A CART-derived teicoplanin fAUC24/MICEtest≥ 462 was significantly associated with reduced treatment failure (P= 0.002). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that achievement of an fAUC24/MICEtest≥ 462 was an independent predictor significantly associated with reduced treatment failure (OR, 0.099; 95% CI, 0.005–0.562;P= 0.032).

An fAUC24/MICEtest≥ 462 was associated with a reduction in treatment failure in GSEF bacteraemia. Further studies are necessary to establish optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets for GSEF bacteraemia.

Enterococci are commensal bacteria residing in the intestinal tract, yet they can cause serious infections.1Mortality rates associated with enterococcal bacteraemia have been reported to range between 20% and 40%.2–4The European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database has documented a continuous increase inEnterococcus faeciumbacteraemia cases, with vancomycin-resistantE. faecium(VRE) emerging as a major global concern.5,6While the prevalence of VRE remains relatively low in Japan,7this regional heterogeneity underscores the critical need to optimize treatment strategies for glycopeptide-susceptibleE. faecium(GSEF) infections to preserve the efficacy of available agents such as teicoplanin.

Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is widely used in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, due to its superiorin vitroactivity against enterococci compared to vancomycin and its longer half-life, which allows once-daily dosing.8Our previous research evaluated the effectiveness and safety of teicoplanin versus vancomycin in the treatment of GSEF bacteraemia.9The results demonstrated that teicoplanin was non-inferior to vancomycin for GSEF bacteraemia treatment, with a significantly lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with teicoplanin. Based on these findings, teicoplanin may be considered a viable alternative to vancomycin in the treatment of GSEF bacteraemia. However, the relationship between the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of teicoplanin and its therapeutic effectiveness in GSEF bacteraemia has yet to be fully elucidated.

This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between the fAUC/MIC ratio of teicoplanin and its therapeutic effectiveness for GSEF bacteraemia and to identify the optimal target fAUC/MIC ratio.

We conducted a retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study at The University of Tokyo Hospital between 1 April 2009 and 30 May 2023. The University of Tokyo’s ethics review board approved the study protocol (approval no. 2023138NI) and waived the requirement for written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Patients with at least one GSEF-positive blood culture who received teicoplanin during the study period were deemed eligible. The exclusion criteria were as follows: lack of storage of microbiological samples, lack of teicoplanin trough concentration (Cmin), age under 18 years, renal replacement therapy or initiation of teicoplanin treatment more than 72 h after infection. GSEF bacteraemia was defined as one or more blood cultures positive forE. faeciumresistant to ampicillin, and susceptible to teicoplanin and vancomycin, accompanied by signs or symptoms of infection consistent with suspected infection sites, as established in previous studies.9,15,16Polymicrobial infections were included in the analysis. For patients with a history of multiple treatments for GSEF bacteraemia, only the first treatment was considered.

We collected demographic and clinical data from patient medical records, including age, sex, height, weight, infection type (community- or hospital-acquired), ICU stay, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Pitt bacteraemia score and laboratory data such as serum creatinine (sCr), serum albumin (ALB), haemoglobin, total bilirubin (T-Bil), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count. These data were recorded on or immediately prior to the day the first GSEF-positive blood culture was obtained. Community-acquired infections were defined as those when the first GSEF-positive blood culture was obtained ≤48 h after hospitalization, while hospital-acquired infections were defined as those when the first positive culture occurred >48 h after admission. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the formula recommended by the Japanese Society of Nephrology.17Neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 500 cells/mm3.18Immunocompromised patients were those who had received cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunosuppressive agents, including calcineurin inhibitors or corticosteroids, within the 30 days preceding the first GSEF-positive blood culture.19The sources of bacteraemia were determined based on microbiological and clinical criteria.16Therapy duration was defined as the period of teicoplanin administration. Source control, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or central venous catheter removal, was defined as any incision, drainage, or debridement performed during teicoplanin therapy. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was defined as the intravenous administration of antimicrobial agents to which all isolated pathogens were susceptible, within 24 h of obtaining the positive blood culture.2,20Co-administered antibiotics other than teicoplanin were reviewed to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy.

For this study, teicoplanin MIC determinations were performed on archived isolates using a commercial automated broth microdilution method with the MicroScan WalkAway-96 Plus system (MICWalkAway) (Beckman Coulter) and gradient diffusion method (MICEtest) (Etest, bioMérieux) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Due to a change in the MIC measurement range during the study period, all isolates were remeasured using the MicroScan WalkAway-96 Plus system for consistency. The MICWalkAwaymeasurement range was 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg/L. The MICEtestresults were reviewed and confirmed independently by three clinical microbiologists who were blinded to the clinical outcomes of the patients from whom the isolates were obtained. In cases where disagreement occurred among all three operators, the MIC was retested and determined by the representative operator, taking the initial results into consideration.

The primary PK/PD parameter for this study was the ratio of the estimated 24-h free-drug area under the curve to the MIC (fAUC24/MICEtest). The estimation of fAUC24was based on totalCminmeasured during the maintenance phase of therapy (at least 3 days after treatment initiation). Our institutional dosing protocol recommends a loading dose of 8–10 mg/kg administered three times approximately every 12 h within the first 48 h for patients with normal renal function, followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg once daily from Day 3. This loading regimen is intended to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations, allowingCminvalues measured during the maintenance phase to serve as a reliable surrogate for drug exposure. Teicoplanin doses were routinely proposed by a pharmacist using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with a targetCminfor teicoplanin set at 15–30 mg/L in line with guideline recommendations,22though actual dosing was determined at the discretion of the attending physician.

Finally, the free AUC24(fAUC24) was estimated by multiplying the total AUC24by fu. The resulting fAUC24/MICEtestratio was used for all subsequent PK/PD analyses.

Continuous variables, expressed as medians with IQRs, were compared between the treatment success and treatment failure groups using the Mann–WhitneyU-test. Categorical variables were compared between the two groups using the χ² test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. To identify predictors of treatment failure, several steps were taken for the logistic regression analysis. First, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the optimal cut-off value for the fAUC24/MICEtestassociated with treatment failure, according to the previous vancomycin PK/PD study.32This created a dichotomous variable for the PK/PD parameter. Next, a multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to assess the independent effect of the fAUC24/MICEteston treatment failure. To ensure the model was clinically robust and to adjust for key prognostic factors, we included several covariates based on their established clinical importance in severe infections, as guided by previous literature.33–35Specifically, the CCI, immunosuppressed state and Pitt bacteraemia score were forced into the model as adjustment variables. Multicollinearity was assessed by calculating variance inflation factors (VIFs), with a VIF > 10 indicating collinearity. In cases of collinearity, only one variable was included in the analysis. Model calibration was evaluated with the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and JMP Pro 18.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A two-sidedPvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

We identified 98 patients withE. faeciumbacteraemia who received teicoplanin treatment, of whom 76 were included in the final analysis (Figure1). The baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table1. The median ages were 61.5 years (IQR, 53.3–74.5) in the treatment success group and 56.5 years (IQR, 52.0–66.0) in the treatment failure group. Mechanical ventilation was used more frequently in the treatment failure group than in the treatment success group (27.8% versus 3.4%,P= 0.007). More than half of the patients in both groups were in an immunosuppressed state. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy and source control were implemented in over 80% of cases in both groups. Because the distribution of polymicrobial infections was balanced between the groups and appropriate therapy was achieved in more than 80% of cases in both groups, polymicrobial infection was not included as a variable in the multivariable regression analysis.

The primary outcome, treatment failure, occurred in 18 of 76 patients (23.7%). Follow-up blood cultures were obtained in 63 of 76 cases (83%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 7.9% (6/76). To investigate the relationship between drug exposure and primary outcome, we first analysed the MIC distribution and then the teicoplanin PK/PD parameters. The MIC of each isolate was determined by Etest, as all MICWalkAwayvalues were ≤2 mg/L. The MICEtestvalues for the 76 isolates ranged from 0.023 to 1 mg/L. The MICEtestretests were performed on eight isolates according to the study protocol, and all retest results were within a 2-fold range of the initial values. As shown in Table2, there was a significant difference in the MICEtestdistribution between the treatment success and failure groups [median 0.25 mg/L (IQR, 0.13–0.50) versus 0.50 mg/L (IQR, 0.35–0.50);P= 0.008].

Next, we compared several teicoplanin PK/PD parameters between the groups (Table2). The PK analysis for our 76 patients yielded substantial inter-individual variability (CV%) for clearance (39.2%) and steady-state volume of distribution (43.8%), while variability was low for the distribution rate parameters, α (4.7%) and K12 (0.1%). The median fAUC24/MICEtestwas found to be significantly higher in the treatment success group than in the treatment failure group [412.3 (IQR, 204.6–652.3) versus 245.3 (IQR, 167.6–372.5);P= 0.021]. In contrast, there were no significant differences in totalCminor fAUC24values alone. Based on this finding, we used CART analysis to determine the optimal fAUC24/MICEtestcut-off value for predicting treatment failure, which was identified as 462. Figure2shows the distribution of treatment outcomes across different fAUC24/MICEtestranges. It demonstrates a marked reduction in treatment–failure ratio among patients with an fAUC24/MICEtest≥ 462.

To evaluate the clinical relevance of this PK/PD target, we stratified patients by this cut-off and compared their outcomes (Table3). Patients who achieved the target (fAUC24/MICEtest≥ 462) had a significantly lower incidence of treatment failure compared to those who did not (3.7% versus 34.7%;P= 0.002).

Data are presented asn(%) for categorical variables.

To explore the relationship between drug exposure and toxicity, fAUC24andCminvalues were compared between patients with and without adverse events. There were no significant differences in median fAUC24orCminvalues for patients who experienced nephrotoxicity (n= 6) compared to those who did not (fAUC24: 86.2 versus 99.4 mg·h/L,P= 0.184;Cmin: 17.1 versus 18.4 mg/L,P= 0.470). Similarly, no significant association was found between drug exposure and the incidence of liver injury or other adverse drug reactions.

The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis are shown in Table4. After adjusting for the CCI, immunosuppressed state and Pitt bacteraemia score, achieving an fAUC24/MICEtest≥ 462 remained an independent predictor of reduced treatment failure (OR, 0.099; 95% CI, 0.005–0.562;P= 0.032). In this model, the other covariates were not significantly associated with the outcome.

All variables in the final model had VIFs below 2, indicating no significant multicollinearity. Model calibration was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, which indicated a good fit (P= 0.149). Discrimination, evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.792, indicating acceptable model performance.

This study aimed to determine the teicoplanin PK/PD target associated with clinical outcomes in patients with GSEF bacteraemia. We found that a teicoplanin fAUC24/MICEtestvalue of ≥462 was an independent predictor of reduced treatment failure, after adjusting for key clinical prognostic factors (Table4). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a specific fAUC24/MICEtesttarget for teicoplanin in this patient population.

Our analysis revealed that while totalCminand fAUC24values did not differ between the treatment success and failure groups, the PK/PD indices incorporating MIC, namely fAUC24/MICEtestandCmin/MICEtest, were significantly different (Table2). This underscores the critical role of MIC in determining therapeutic outcomes for GSEF bacteraemia. The median MICEtestin the treatment failure group was double that of the success group (0.50 versus 0.25 mg/L), highlighting that even small variations in MIC can substantially impact the achievement of PK/PD targets. The MIC values in our cohort were relatively low compared to some reports from other regions,36suggesting that the PK/PD targets identified here may need to be validated in populations with different MIC distributions. Our previous report demonstrated that teicoplanin was non-inferior to vancomycin in efficacy, with a treatment success ratio of 64.9% in patients with GSEF bacteraemia; however, regions with different MIC distributions may yield different outcomes.9Studies comparing antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for enterococci, including Etest, broth microdilution, disk diffusion and automated methods, have shown discrepancies in teicoplanin MIC values across methods.37,38Notably, these studies primarily focused on VRE, offering limited data applicable to GSEF. To ensure the reliability of MICEtestvalues in this study, three clinical microbiologists were involved, with retesting conducted in cases of disagreement to minimize inter-operator variability. This approach enhances the reliability of the MICEtestresults. Future studies should further evaluate the reliability of teicoplanin MIC testing methods specifically for GSEF.

A key aspect of our study was the estimation of free drug concentrations. Teicoplanin is highly protein bound, and conditions such as hypoalbuminaemia, common in critically ill patients, can alter this binding. By calculating a patient-specific fu, we aimed to provide a more pharmacologically relevant assessment of drug exposure. While this estimation relies on a theoretical formula and a literature-derived fu, this approach is considered a valid alternative when direct measurement of free concentrations is not feasible.

The accuracy of AUC estimation itself, derived from a single trough concentration via a Bayesian approach, is another important consideration. In this study, we chose a two-compartment model by Nakayama et al., which is well-validated in Japanese patients. Although estimating distribution phase parameters from a single trough point has inherent limitations, our analysis of the individual parameters provided some reassurance. As shown in theResults, while the variability for distribution rate parameters was low, the substantial inter-individual variability for clearance (CV = 39.2%) and volume of distribution (Vdss, CV = 43.8%) suggests that the model robustly estimated these key parameters for each patient. Nevertheless, this single-point estimation method does not capture the impact of drug exposure during the critical initial phase of treatment and remains a limitation of our study. Future prospective studies with serial sampling during initial phase are warranted.

We discuss two perspectives on how to translate the findings of this study into clinical practice. First, we consider the importance of precise MIC determination. This study demonstrated the critical role of MIC values below the CLSI susceptibility breakpoint of 2 mg/L.21However, Etest is not routinely performed in many clinical settings. Our findings suggest that even small variations in MIC can substantially impact the achievement of PK/PD targets. Clinically, if a patient’s response is suboptimal despite adequateCminlevels, it is essential to consider the possibility of a higher-than-expected MIC. In such cases, confirming the precise MIC value with Etest and subsequently adjusting the dosage to increase fAUC or switching to an alternative agent may be necessary.

Second, we consider the utility ofCminas a surrogate marker. Since software for assessing fAUC is not widely available,Cminremains a practical alternative. In our study, the medianCminin both groups was approximately 18 mg/L, aligning with the recommended therapeutic range of 15–30 mg/L for MRSA.22,39Given that the majority of isolates in our cohort (84.2%) had an MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L, a targetCminof 15–30 mg/L appears effective for treating most GSEF infections in regions with similar MIC distributions. This targetCminlikely ensures that the fAUC24/MICEtesttarget of ≥462 is achieved for these low-MIC isolates.

Despite the important clinical implications of this study, several limitations should be discussed. First, this was a retrospective analysis. While the multivariable analysis adjusted for patient backgrounds between the treatment success and treatment failure groups, unmeasured confounders that may have influenced treatment failure cannot be excluded. Known risk factors associated with clinical outcomes of teicoplanin therapy were systematically collected. Second, microbiological failure could not be assessed in all patients, which may have led to misclassification of the primary outcome. Third, this single-centre study was conducted at a university hospital, limiting the generalizability of the findings, particularly since over half of the participants were immunosuppressed. Fourth, the relatively small sample size, particularly the number of treatment failure cases, may have limited our ability to identify other significant predictors of the outcome.

Despite these limitations, this is the first study to identify a target fAUC24/MICEtestvalue for teicoplanin in GSEF bacteraemia. The findings provide evidence supporting the importance of PK-/PD-based regimens in the treatment of GSEF bacteraemia.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a teicoplanin fAUC24/MICEtestvalue of ≥462 was associated with reduced treatment failure in patients with GSEF bacteraemia, without increasing adverse drug events. Larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm these PK/PD targets for optimizing clinical outcomes and safety.
