Cardiovascular disease remains a leading health issue globally, with atherosclerosis being a significant contributor, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes who face multiple risk factors. This study aims to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for carotid atherosclerosis specifically in patients with type 2 diabetes, addressing the lack of effective risk-stratification tools.

A retrospective cohort study involving 1,258 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. The 880 diabetic patients diagnosed between 2018 and 2021 were divided into a training set (n= 616) and an internal validation set (n= 264) at a 7:3 ratio. An additional 378 patients from 2022 to 2023 were included as an external validation set. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected. Risk factors were identified using LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression, leading to the development of a nomogram. Model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis.

The nomogram identified age, smoking, drinking, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and creatinine as independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. The model demonstrated good discrimination, with area under the curve values of 0.791, 0.725, and 0.721 for the training, internal, and external validation sets, respectively. Calibration curves indicated a strong alignment between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes. Decision curve analysis confirmed the model’s clinical utility, especially when the threshold probability was above 15%.

The developed nomogram serves as a robust tool for predicting carotid atherosclerosis risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, facilitating early intervention and personalized management strategies in clinical practice.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the dominant health challenge of the twenty-first century, leading to unprecedented morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. The World Health Organization’s 2019 report has demonstrated that there were approximately 17.9 million CVD-related deaths annually, highlighting the profound impact of CVD and emphasizing the urgent need for innovative prevention and treatment strategies [1]. Atherosclerosis, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CVD, is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, inflammatory cells, and fibrous components within arterial walls [2,3]. It is the primary catalyst for most cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes, as it restricts blood flow to vital organs [4].

Carotid atherosclerosis is of particular significance as an early marker of systemic atherosclerotic disease, providing insights into an individual’s vascular health [5]. The accessibility of the carotid arteries for ultrasound examination makes it an invaluable tool for early detection of cardiovascular risks, enabling healthcare providers to implement preventive measures before the onset of severe complications [6].

The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents a considerable challenge in CVD management. Type 2 diabetes accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis and increases the risk of cardiovascular complications [7–9]. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are more susceptible to developing atherosclerosis due to prolonged high blood glucose levels, which adversely affect endothelial cell function in blood vessels [10–13]. This dysfunction accelerates the deposition of low-density lipoprotein in arterial walls, promoting plaque formation [12]. Insulin resistance not only exacerbates inflammatory responses but also disrupts lipid metabolism in adipocytes, leading to elevated levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides, which further increase the risk of CVD [14,15]. Moreover, type 2 diabetes is associated with enhanced oxidative stress, potentially accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis [16]. In the Chinese population, individuals with type 2 diabetes may face a 1.90 to 2.26 times greater risk of CVD-related mortality compared to the general population [17]. A prospective study indicated that diabetic patients with carotid artery stenosis of 50% or more are nearly 2.5 times more likely to experience cardiovascular death than their nondiabetic counterparts [18]. The complex interaction between high blood glucose, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation in type 2 diabetes collectively intensifies the atherosclerotic process.

Furthermore, there are multiple risk factors for macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Effectively managing these diverse risk factors can significantly diminish the incidence of macrovascular complications in these diabetic individuals [19]. However, current clinical practices for assessing and managing carotid atherosclerosis risk, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, are limited by the absence of specific and sensitive predictive models. This gap obstructs the early identification and intervention strategies essential for mitigating the progression of CVD in this high-risk group.

In this study, we developed and externally validated a predictive model for carotid atherosclerosis risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Unlike previous models that relied solely on internal datasets, our approach incorporates a comprehensive validation strategy, including both internal and external validation sets. This robust methodology enhances the model’s generalizability and clinical applicability, offering a reliable tool for personalized intervention. Our findings set a new standard for proactive cardiovascular care in the type 2 diabetic population.

This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients with type 2 diabetes from January 2018 to October 2023 at the Southern Medical University Shenzhen Hospital were recruited. Inclusion criteria: (1) Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to established diagnostic criteria, which included typical symptoms and specific blood glucose thresholds: random blood glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, fasting blood glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, 2-hour OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) blood glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, or HbA1c level ≥ 6.5% [20]; (2) Patients who completed the questionnaire on lifestyle [21]; (3) Patients who underwent carotid artery and liver ultrasonography; (4) Patients who received routine blood biochemical tests. Exclusion criteria: Patients with severe heart, brain, liver, or kidney dysfunction. This study was conducted in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the TRIPOD guidelines, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University (Approval Number: NYSZYYEC20240006). Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study and the minimal risk posed to participants.

As previously described, the baseline clinical data were collected from the Medical Record Information Management System [22–24]. The following data were collected: (1) demographic data, including gender, age, etc.; (2) general health indicators, including exercise status, presence of fatty liver, smoking history, drinking history, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure; and (3) biochemical markers, including lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, total bile acid, and thyroid stimulating hormone.

The primary outcome variable was the presence of carotid atherosclerosis. For carotid atherosclerosis diagnosis, two experienced ultrasound physicians assessed the ultrasound images of bilateral carotids in a double-blind manner. The diagnostic criteria for carotid atherosclerosis were based on the American College of Cardiology’s consensus statement [25], which advises against equating carotid artery wall thickening with atherosclerosis, especially in the absence of plaque. Therefore, in this study, carotid atherosclerosis was defined when there was an intima-media thickness of ≥ 1.5 mm that extended into the vessel lumen or there was a specific increase in intima-media thickness of more than 50% compared to the peripheral intima-media thickness [26].

Using a simple random sampling method, 880 diabetic patients from 2018 to 2021 were proportionally divided into a training set (616 individuals) and an internal validation set (264 individuals) at a 7:3 ratio. An additional cohort of 378 diabetic patients from 2022 to 2023 was designated as the external validation set. In the training set, the variables withP< 0.1 identified in the univariate logistic regression were subjected to the least absolute value shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm regression and 10-fold cross-validation, which was conducted using the glmnet package. After that, the stepwise backward multivariate logistic regression was performed to construct a nomogram model for predicting carotid atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. To determine the predictive performance of the model, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted using the pROC package. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. To evaluate the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes, the Calibration curves were generated using the val.prob and calibrate functions from the rms package, with bootstrap methods (resampling = 1000) in both training and validation sets. Using the rmda package, the decision curve analysis was conducted to assess the net clinical benefit of the nomogram predictive model. Finally, the rms package was utilized for data aggregation, documenting the model’s final variables, establishing nomogram parameters, and generating bar plots.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software version 27.0 and RStudio version 4.3.1. Continuous variables with a normal distribution are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, while those without a normal distribution are represented by the median (interquartile range). Group comparisons of continuous variables were conducted using the t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.P< 0.05 indicates significant differences.

The study flowchart is presented in Fig.1. A total of 1,258 eligible patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited, including 360 individuals aged below 45 years and 898 aged 45 years or older. Of the participants, 66.14% were male and 33.86% were female. Moreover, only 58 cases (4.61%) had carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%. The participants were randomized into a training set (n= 616), an internal validation set (n= 264), and an external validation set (n= 378). Their baseline clinical data are listed in Table1. In the training set, 332 (53.9%) patients were diagnosed with carotid atherosclerosis, compared to 146 (55.3%) in the internal validation set and 212 (56.8%) in the external validation set. Notably, the cutoff point for uric acid grouping was established at 410 µmol/L, instead of the conventional diagnostic threshold of 420 µmol/L. This cutoff was determined based on the reference value of the uric acid test reagent employed in our hospital, ensuring consistency between the uric acid grouping in the study and clinical test results. Considering that various uric acid test reagents may differ in types and testing methods, this approach aligns with the hospital’s standards and guarantees the clinical relevance of the study findings.

LASSO regression and 10-fold cross-validation were employed to refine variables withP< 0.1 from the univariate logistic regression analysis. The variables were selected based on the minimum criteria (Fig.2). Figure2A illustrates the selection of the optimal λ for LASSO regression using 10-fold cross-validation. Figure2B depicts the coefficient paths as λ changes. A total of 11 variables were identified, including gender, age, smoking, drinking, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase (Table2). These variables were subsequently evaluated using stepwise backward multivariate logistic regression to construct a nomogram for predicting carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients (Fig.3).

The final nomogram model included the following variables: age, smoking, drinking, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a), non-HDL-C, and creatinine. The nomogram assigns points for each factor to estimate the risk of carotid atherosclerosis. For instance, a randomly selected male type 2 diabetic patient, aged 59 years, with a smoking history, no history of alcohol consumption, a systolic blood pressure of 135 mmHg, lipoprotein(a) level of 67 nmol/L, non-HDL-C of 5.6 mmol/L, and a creatinine level of 83 µmol/L, had the following scores: 100, 34, 8, 0, 0, 24, and 0, respectively, summing to a total score of 166. This cumulative score suggests a 73% probability of developing carotid atherosclerosis.

ROC curves were plotted to assess the performance of the nomogram model in predicting carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients. The results revealed that the AUC was 0.791 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.756–0.826) in the training set (Fig.4A), 0.725 (95% CI, 0.664–0.787) in the internal validation set (Fig.4B), and 0.721 (95% CI, 0.671–0.772) in the external validation set (Fig.4C), respectively. These findings demonstrate the robust performance of the nomogram model in predicting the risk of carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients.

Additionally, the calibration curve showed a strong correlation between the nomogram’s predicted probabilities of carotid atherosclerosis and the actual observed outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients. This consistency was evident in the training set (Fig.4D), internal validation set (Fig.4E), and external validation set (Fig.4F).

Moreover, decision curve analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical utility of the nomogram predictive model. The analysis revealed that in the training set, when the predicted threshold probability was greater than 15%, the nomogram model yielded greater benefits than an ‘all-or-none’ intervention strategy in predicting the risk of carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients (Fig.5A). Similarly, in the internal (Fig.5B) and external validation sets (Fig.5C), the nomogram presented superior clinical utility compared to total intervention or non-intervention strategies at predefined threshold probabilities for both type 2 diabetic patients and clinicians. These findings validate the nomogram’s predictive capability in assessing the risk of carotid atherosclerosis among type 2 diabetic patients.

Diabetes is a well-established risk factor for CVD [27]. In recent years, there has been growing attention to the early detection and prevention of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes [28–31]. Although several models related to type 2 diabetes and carotid atherosclerosis have been explored, existing models often lack external validation, which limits their generalizability and clinical utility across broader diabetic populations [32]. External validation is crucial for assessing a model’s applicability across different clinical settings and patient populations. Therefore, developing an externally validated model with enhanced generalizability and clinical usability that can reliably identify high-risk carotid atherosclerosis individuals among patients with type 2 diabetes is of significant importance for advancing clinical applications.

Different arterial territories exhibit distinct patterns in the development of atherosclerosis and respond differently to various risk factors [33]. For example, carotid atherosclerosis is commonly associated with increased age, elevated systolic blood pressure, and lipid levels. In contrast, lower extremity arterial disease is more prevalent among smokers and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, coronary artery disease is primarily driven by dysregulated lipid metabolism, while renal artery disease is often observed in elderly and diabetic populations. The focus of our study on predicting carotid atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes represents a critical step toward individualized risk assessment, emphasizing the need for tailored prevention and intervention strategies in clinical practice. The carotid atherosclerosis risk is increased in diabetic patients due to the simultaneous presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors [34]. Age represents an unmodifiable risk factor for diabetes [35]. Several studies have reported that age is strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes [36,37]. Our study has obtained consistent results, showing that age was an independent risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. This relationship is primarily driven by age-related physiological and hormonal changes that accelerate atherosclerotic progression. As emphasized by Piechocki et al. [33], aging significantly contributes to the systemic burden of atherosclerosis, particularly in non-coronary sites, yet older patients are still underrepresented in clinical trials. As such, our nomogram could help fill a critical gap by facilitating early identification and intervention for elderly diabetic populations typically excluded from traditional studies.

Smoking is strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis, which leads to atherosclerosis and an increased susceptibility to cardiovascular events. Regular smokers have a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes compared to non-smokers [38]. A meta-analysis conducted by Pan et al. [39] demonstrated that diabetic smokers had a 51% increased susceptibility to coronary heart disease and a 49% higher risk of cardiovascular death. Furthermore, it has been shown that smoking is the most important predictor of an increased plaque number, which is strongly associated with age and systolic blood pressure [40,41]. Consistently, our results indicated that smoking was identified as an independent predictor, further emphasizing its crucial role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.

Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with an increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. The results of this study revealed that the score for moderate drinkers was 0, for non-drinkers was 9.5, and for heavy drinkers was 93. This distribution of scores further supports the dose-dependent relationship between alcohol consumption and atherosclerosis risk. Moderate alcohol consumption increases plasma HDL-C levels by approximately 12%, and this effect is dose-dependent as well [42]. However, as alcohol consumption increases, so do blood pressure and triglyceride levels, potentially diminishing the cardiovascular protective effect of HDL-C. Research has shown that the protective effect of alcohol consumption on coronary artery disease gradually diminishes with excessive alcohol intake [43,44]. Moreover, the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of atherosclerotic CVD is significantly influenced by HDL-C levels [45]. In the case of moderate alcohol consumption, elevated HDL-C levels contribute to slowing the progression of atherosclerosis. However, once alcohol consumption surpasses a certain threshold, excessive consumption may counteract the beneficial effect of elevated HDL-C due to alcohol’s negative effects on blood pressure and triglycerides [45].

Moreover, our study identified hypertension as an independent risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis, which aligns with previous studies [46,47]. Hypertension affects the development of carotid atherosclerosis through various pathways [48–50]. Hypertension may increase the tension within the carotid wall near the plaques, resulting in plaque destabilization and increasing the risk of plaque bleeding and rupture [51]. Notably, among the elderly, hypertension has been recognized as a significant factor contributing to elevated occurrences of CVD, strokes, and overall mortality rates [52]. Hypertension, in combination with arterial stiffness, promotes the progression of atherosclerosis [53].

This study also demonstrated an association between lipoprotein(a) and non-HDL-C with increased carotid atherosclerosis risk in diabetic patients. Guidelines by the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology confirm that the circulating lipoprotein(a) level is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis [54,55]. Jun et al. [56] revealed a significant correlation between elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) and carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type II diabetes, independent of conventional cardiac metabolic risk factors. The non-HDL-C contains low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, intermediate-density lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants, predominantly containing apolipoprotein B, which is a robust marker for atherosclerosis formation [57]. The National Lipid Association in the United States has recognized non-HDL-C as a primary therapeutic target [58], and guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society recommend its inclusion in the assessment of CVD risk [59].

There is a strong correlation between impaired kidney function and atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. The intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries in diabetic patients is also associated with kidney function, suggesting that atherosclerosis may influence kidney function [60]. Furthermore, the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetic nephropathy is higher than in healthy individuals, with insulin resistance and the inflammatory response playing a significant role in this process [61]. However, existing studies have not definitively established a direct link between carotid plaque and elevated creatinine levels, although a relationship between carotid atherosclerosis markers and decreased kidney function has been indicated [62]. Our study yielded similar results, demonstrating that creatinine was an independent risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients, further supporting the association between creatinine and atherosclerosis in diabetic patients [1,62]. Additionally, previous studies have also found that renal artery stenosis frequently coexists with coronary artery disease and carotid artery stenosis, particularly in elderly patients with diabetes [63,64]. Although renal artery stenosis was not directly assessed in this study, we identified impaired kidney function—indicated by elevated creatinine levels—as an independent risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that renovascular disease and kidney dysfunction may be associated with both carotid and coronary atherosclerosis, especially in elderly patients with diabetes.

Notably, the ROC analysis results reveal a notable decrease in AUC values across the training and validation phases. The model achieved an AUC of 0.791 in the training set, indicating excellent discrimination capability. However, this was reduced to 0.725 in the internal validation set and further decreased to 0.719 in the external validation set. Importantly, in the internal and external validation sets, the lower limit of the 95% CI fell below 0.7, suggesting a decline in the model’s predictive performance when applied to different cohorts. This variation may be attributed to several factors, including differences in demographic characteristics, clinical profiles, and underlying characteristics of the populations studied. These results highlight the need for ongoing refinement of our predictive model as well as the necessity for larger, more diverse cohorts in future studies to confirm its robustness and generalizability across various clinical settings.

This study provides valuable insights, with several opportunities for further refinement. A prospective cohort design could offer greater insight into causality, while a multi-center approach would enhance the generalizability of the findings across diverse populations. Additionally, incorporating factors such as genetic predisposition and long-term glycemic control could strengthen the model’s predictive power. Longitudinal measurements of risk factors over time would further enhance the stability and accuracy of individual patient risk profiles.

In conclusion, our study successfully developed and validated a nomogram for predicting carotid atherosclerosis risk among type 2 diabetic patients, emphasizing the critical need for tailored cardiovascular interventions in this high-risk group. The model’s good discrimination and calibration suggest its potential utility in clinical settings, enabling healthcare providers to better identify diabetic individuals who may benefit from preventive measures. Future research should aim to validate this model across diverse populations and explore its applicability in longitudinal studies to enhance risk stratification and management of CVD in diabetes.
