Pre-competition weight loss (WL) is a widely adopted strategy in weight-sensitive sports, particularly among combat sport. This strategy enables athletes to compete at a weight or weight classes below their habitual body mass (BM). Although research on WL for weight-sensitive sports has steadily grown, it mostly employs the term “RWL”. However, there is no compelling or universally accepted definition of RWL.

In this current opinion, we discussed the deficiencies and misuse of the current definition of RWL and proposed a new theoretical framework to provide a basis for better defining RWL in the future.

A most commonly used definition describes RWL as losing 5% of body mass within 7 days. However, this definition is somewhat arbitrary and lacks empirical justification. This definition is based on two parameters: magnitude (5% BM) and duration (7 days), yet its cut-off remains rigid and lacks empirical support. Several studies on combat athletes have found that a relatively faster rate of WL can lead to significant negative impacts on performance and health variables. We argue that using WL rate as the core criterion is more robust, as the term “rapid” emphasizes the speed of WL. However, at what rate does WL become classified as RWL? The limited research in this area underscores the need for studies to establish a solid foundation for defining RWL. In many studies, authors use the term “RWL,” especially in quantitative research. However, using the current definition, some practices reported by participants (e.g., losing 2% BM over 30 days) do not qualify as RWL. Finally, we propose that WL (not RWL) practices be classified along two dimensions: WL rate and WL magnitude. Based on rate, practices can be categorized as slow, moderate, or rapid WL. Based on magnitude, they can be classified as low, moderate, or high WL.

Pre-competition weight loss (WL) is a widely adopted strategy in weight-sensitive sports [1–4], particularly among combat sports [5]. This strategy enables athletes to compete at a weight or in a weight class below their habitual body mass (BM). WL is commonly classified into gradual WL and rapid WL (RWL) [6–8]. Gradual WL refers to a prolonged reduction in BM over weeks or months, often achieved through sustainable dietary modifications and training adaptations. In contrast, RWL involves a more aggressive approach, typically within 7 days, to achieve a substantial BM reduction in a short period [9]. In recent decades, pre-competition RWL garners substantial international attention due to its significant implications for athletes’ health, performance, and competition fairness [10,11]. Extensive research indicates that reducing BM too rapidly or excessively before competition can have a range of adverse physical and psychological effects on athletes, including hypohydration, reduced plasma volume, bone loss, kidney damage, mood disturbances, and even death [10,12–15]. Despite long-standing calls from researchers [12,16] to restrict RWL and attempts by some organizations to revise competition rules [17], RWL remains highly prevalent [5]. One important reason is that the current definition of RWL is flawed and researchers overlooked this issue. This has led to the misuse of terminology and, to a certain extent, hindered the relevant personnel from further understanding and restricting RWL. In this commentary, we discuss the deficiencies and misuse of the current definition of RWL and proposed a new theoretical framework to provide a basis for better defining RWL in the future.

Although research on WL for weight-sensitive sports has steadily grown, it mostly employs the term “RWL.” However, there is no compelling or universally accepted definition of RWL. Even in the latest American College of Sports Medicine Expert Consensus Statement on Weight Loss in weight-category Sports, there is no clear definition of RWL [18]. Consequently, using the term “rapid” often lacks a solid foundation. Current definitions of RWL include losing 5% of BM within 7 days [9] or reducing 2–10% (or more) of BM during the few days before competition (mostly in the last 2–3 days) [12]. Among these, the most commonly used is the definition of losing 5% of BM within 7 days [9]. However, this definition is somewhat arbitrary and lacks empirical justification.

Notably, this definition is based on two parameters: magnitude (5% BM) and duration (7 days), yet its cutoff remains rigid and lacks empirical support. For example, would losing 4.9% of BM within 7 days not qualify as RWL? Or would losing 5% of BM within 8 days not qualify? Such marginal difference seems insufficient to exclude these cases from the scope of RWL, as their associated physiological and psychological effects may be very similar. Furthermore, these two variables can combine into numerous scenarios based on daily WL rates, some of which may lead to significant differences in physiological and psychological responses, thereby undermining the validity of this definition. For instance, consider two cases included under the current definition. The first involves losing 0.2% BM daily for 6 days, followed by 3.8% BM on the last day. The second involves a uniform loss of 0.7% BM daily over 7 days. Are both scenarios considered RWL? Therefore, it is not difficult to find that the current definition is very rough and it is hard to truly distinguish it from gradual WL at the physiological and psychological levels.

This comparison introduces another critical variable: WL rate (the percentage of BM lost per day), which may play a more decisive role in determining the severity of WL-induced consequences. This raises a critical question: What should form the core of an RWL definition – duration and magnitude, or rate? A recent review suggests that gradual WL has more favorable effects on fat mass (FM), body fat percentage, and resting metabolic rate in overweight or obese individuals than RWL [6]. Although it does not explicitly provide a definition of RWL and gradual WL, the WL rate of the RWL protocol in the original study it included was 1.8 to 3 times that of the gradual WL protocol. Additionally, several studies on combat athletes have reported that a relatively faster rate of WL can lead to significant negative impacts on performance and health variables [8,19,20]. For instance, a study investigating a male combat sport athlete found that 7 weeks of daily energy availability (EA) fluctuations averaging 20 kcal·kg fat-free mass (FFM)−1·d−1led to reductions in BM and FM without disrupting physiological systems related to the Male Athlete Triad and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) [20]. In contrast, a subsequent period of five consecutive days of EA < 10 kcal·kg FFM−1·d−1induced consequences associated with the Male Athlete Triad and RED-S [20]. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that faster rates are more detrimental than lower ones, at least when a similar number of days is spent in the process or when the same magnitude of BM is reduced within a shorter period. However, at what rate does WL become classified as RWL? The limited research in this area underscores the need for studies to establish a solid foundation for defining RWL. We argue that using WL rate as the core criterion is more robust, as the term “rapid” emphasizes the speed of WL. Furthermore, another study found that in WL protocols where the reduction is ≤5% BM, neither chronic WL nor RWL impaired the performance of experienced wrestlers and judo athletes [8]. In other words, if the total magnitude of WL does not reach a threshold that impacts an athlete’s performance, then the rate of WL is unlikely to have a significant effect. This indicates that while the rate of WL is a very important aspect of WL (distinguishing between chronic and RWL), the magnitude of WL is also crucial (distinguishing between low and high magnitude WL).

The lack of a compelling and consistent definition of RWL has led to significant confusion and misinterpretation in the literature. This inconsistency adversely affects relevant studies and makes it challenging for sports organizations and medical professionals to establish appropriate guidelines or policies. Without a standardized definition, it becomes difficult to differentiate between acceptable and high-risk practices, hindering the implementation of effective regulations to limit unsafe WL practices. For example, most studies classify WL exceeding 5% of BM within 7 days as RWL, while others use different thresholds or timeframes [12], making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions across studies. Moreover, this lack of clarity can have practical implications for athletes and coaches, as they may rely on inconsistent definitions when developing weight management strategies. For example, some athletes might assume that as long as the WL magnitude is relatively low, it does not qualify as RWL, even if achieved within an extremely short period, thereby underestimating the risks associated with rapid dehydration or extreme dieting. These examples underscore the urgent need for a unified definition of RWL to enhance research accuracy and provide clear guidance for athletes and practitioners.

In many studies, authors use the term “RWL,” especially in quantitative research. However, based on the current definition, some practices reported by participants (e.g. losing 2% BM over 30 days) do not qualify as RWL [5]. This represents a misuse of terminology, which may stem from the specific title of the questionnaire used (e.g. Rapid Weight Loss Questionnaire) [21] and the widespread adoption of the term RWL. In contrast, some researchers avoid using RWL, possibly because they recognize that its definition remains unclear, opting instead for WL, weight management, weight cutting, or BM reduction [22,23]. Until a clear definition of RWL is established, we recommend using the broader term “WL,” as most WL practices involve both rapid and gradual WL components. Additionally, when reporting WL data, we suggest that authors present the methods, magnitude, duration, and rate of RWL, while also indicating whether other long-term WL occurred.

We propose that WL (not RWL) practices be classified along two dimensions: WL rate and WL magnitude. Based on rate, practices can be categorized as slow, moderate, or rapid rate WL. Based on magnitude, they can be classified as low, moderate, or high magnitude WL. These dimensions yield nine distinct WL patterns (Figure 1(A)).

Previous research often failed to differentiate between rate and magnitude, a critical oversight. These are, in fact, separate dimensions. Differentiating these concepts is crucial, as RWL does not necessarily mean a high magnitude, and slow WL does not always mean a low magnitude. For example, an athlete could reduce a low magnitude of BM at a rapid WL rate (low-magnitude rapid-rate WL, e.g. 2.5% BM in a single day, totaling only 2.5% BM), or they might reduce a high magnitude of BM at a slow WL rate (high-magnitude slow-rate WL, e.g. 0.2% BM daily over 60 days, totaling 12% BM). High-magnitude WL, such as a 17.5% reduction in BM [24], even when achieved at a slow WL rate, may be as harmful as some RWL practice [25]. For example, on November 21 1997, a 22-year-old male wrestler in Wisconsin lost 11.1 kg (14% BM, approximately 1% BM per week) over 10 weeks, ultimately leading to his death [13]. Providing such a distinction in the literature will help researchers and applied practitioners understand the respective roles of magnitude and rate in WL and determine the implications of each WL strategy.

The proposed framework clearly distinguishes between slow, moderate, and rapid WL rates while incorporating WL rate as a distinct parameter rather than conflating it with magnitude. Additionally, it is worth noting that WL rates can be analyzed as daily or overall rates. Athletes’ overall duration of WL practice (e.g. 14 days) often involves variable daily rates (i.e. losing 0.2% BM per day for 6 days, followed by 3.8% BM on the last day). By integrating all daily rates, practitioners can derive an overall WL pattern (Figure 1(A)) and WL rate distribution (Figure 1(B)). There is no daily WL magnitude, as the daily WL rate (BM% WL per day) is the daily WL magnitude. Currently, no such research exists in the field of WL in sport. However, similar approaches have been well-developed in studies on training intensity distribution in athletes [26], demonstrating significant impact. These important developments are all based on researchers’ classifications of training intensity, and researchers continue to refine the definitions of training intensity to enhance their understanding [27]. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the methods of WL are also an important factor influencing the degree of risk. Therefore, when conducting research, it is necessary to compare the effects at different rates and magnitudes under the same WL method, or to compare the effects of different WL methods at the same rate and magnitudes.

Future research should initially adopt the proposed conceptual framework then build on this to identify clear thresholds for different rates and magnitudes. Establishing these thresholds through experimental studies is essential to provide a solid foundation for understanding RWL in sport. By categorizing athletes’ WL patterns using this framework, practitioners can better assess and tailor interventions based on individual needs. As more data is generated in each domain, we can explore optimal WL strategies to enhance athlete health and performance.
