The gut microbiota (GM) is increasingly acknowledged for its regulatory role in host immune responses and its influence on various systemic diseases. Nevertheless, whether GM modulates kidney stone disease (KSD) through immune-related mechanisms remains uncertain. To investigate these associations, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in two sequential steps, employing summary-level data sourced from comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Specifically, the potential causal influence of 430 GM features on 731 immune-cell-related traits, and subsequently their effects on KSD susceptibility, was assessed. The primary analysis utilized the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, alongside complementary approaches including MR-Egger regression, weighted median analysis, and various sensitivity evaluations. Moreover, a mediation MR analysis was conducted to determine if specific immune cell subsets mediated relationships between GM and KSD. Our analysis revealed significant causal associations between 15 GM taxa and KSD. Protective effects were observed for genera such as Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Ruminococcaceae, whereas elevated risks of KSD were associated with Bacteroides, Clostridiales, and Subdoligranulum. Furthermore, 35 immune-cell-related phenotypes displayed causal links to KSD risk. Importantly, CD28 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells was identified as a mediator in the protective pathway from Prevotella to KSD, with a mediation effect estimated at –9.019% (P= 0.044). No significant directional pleiotropy or heterogeneity was observed. These findings provide novel causal evidence supporting the existence of a gut–immune–kidney axis, where certain gut microbes influence KSD susceptibility via immune mechanisms. This may guide the development of microbiota- or immune-targeted strategies for the prevention of KSD.

KSD, which includes nephrolithiasis and ureterolithiasis, is a common, recurrent urological disorder worldwide, causing significant reductions in patient quality of life and placing considerable strain on healthcare resources [1–3]. KSD development involves diverse pathogenic factors, including genetic predisposition, metabolic imbalances, dietary influences, and microenvironmental interactions [4–6]. Traditional studies on KSD have predominantly examined urinary metabolic alterations, whereas investigations into GM contributions have been comparatively limited.

Recently, GM has been recognized as a crucial regulator of metabolic and immune homeostasis in hosts and implicated in numerous metabolic and inflammatory conditions [7,8]. Accumulating evidence suggests potential links between gut microbial composition and the development or prevention of KSD [9]. Specific microbial taxa may influence renal microenvironments and stone formation risk by modulating oxalate metabolism, urinary composition, and inflammation [10–12]. For example, Oxalobacter formigenes is known to reduce oxalate load, thereby decreasing stone risk [13]. Nevertheless, the contribution of GM diversity and community structure to KSD remains incompletely understood.

Recent research indicates a bidirectional relationship between GM and immune cells [14,15]. GM can affect the differentiation, activation, and migration of immune cell populations, while the host immune system, in turn, shapes the gut microbial community [16]. These interactions suggest that GM may influence KSD indirectly through immune-mediated mechanisms. However, to date, no study has systematically validated the hypothesis of a “gut–immune–kidney” axis using causal inference frameworks based on population genetics.

Addressing this knowledge gap, we adopted a systematic two-stage MR strategy based on extensive GWAS data to probe potential causative links between 430 GM profiles and 731 immune cell phenotypes, ultimately examining how these relationships influence KSD susceptibility. Additionally, we conducted mediation MR analyses to clarify the intermediary roles played by immune cells. This study sought to clarify specific biological mechanisms through which GM could influence KSD via immune modulation, thus providing novel mechanistic insights and highlighting potential therapeutic targets for precision-based KSD prevention strategies.

This research applied a two-stage, two-sample MR strategy to investigate possible causal links between genetically inferred KSD risk and GM, as well as to assess whether immune cell phenotypes mediated these associations. First, we performed two-sample MR analyses to evaluate the direct causal effects of GM and immune cell traits on KSD, identifying microbial taxa and immune phenotypes significantly associated with stone risk. In the subsequent phase, we explored whether particular GM taxa causally influenced specific immune cell traits, quantifying the extent to which immune cells mediated associations between GM and KSD. Figure1summarizes the workflow schematic of the study.

Summary statistics for 430 microbial features related to GM were acquired from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, originating from a German cohort of 8,956 subjects (accession IDs: GCST90011301–GCST90011730) [17]. KSD data comprising 10,556 cases and 400,681 control individuals were sourced from the FinnGen R10 database, under phenotype identifier N14_CALCUKIDUR. Summary GWAS data for immune-related traits were derived from a cohort of 3,757 Sardinian individuals (accession IDs: GCST90001391–GCST90002121). This dataset encompassed 731 traits categorized as follows: absolute cell counts (AC;n= 118), median fluorescence intensities (MFI;n= 389), reflecting cell-surface marker expression, morphological traits (n= 32), and relative cell counts (RC;n= 192) [18]. Given that the datasets utilized herein were publicly accessible and originally gathered with appropriate ethical approval and informed participant consent, no further ethical authorization was necessary.

Rigorous selection criteria were applied to identify suitable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) serving as instrumental variables (IVs) representing GM and immune cell phenotypes. SNPs demonstrating suggestive genome-wide significance (p< 1 × 10−5) were retained for analyses [19]. To limit linkage disequilibrium (LD) and maximize IV independence, a stringent clumping procedure was applied within a 10,000-kb window using an R2< 0.001. The strength of IVs was confirmed by calculating the F-statistic, defined as the squared ratio of beta coefficients to their standard errors, with values exceeding 10 signifying sufficient instrument validity.

Statistical analyses were carried out using R software (version 4.3.1) with the “TwoSampleMR” and “ieugwasr” packages. The IVW method was selected as the core analytical approach for causal inference due to its proven reliability and precision [20]. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed p-value cutoff of 0.05. Additionally, Cochran’s Q test assessed heterogeneity among IV estimates; accordingly, we applied a fixed-effects IVW model if heterogeneity was absent (P> 0.05) or a random-effects IVW model if significant heterogeneity (P≤ 0.05) was present [21]. MR-Egger regression intercept tests were applied to evaluate directional pleiotropy, with a P-value < 0.05 indicating significant pleiotropic effects. Mediation analyses investigating the indirect impact of GM traits on KSD through immune cells were executed using the product-of-coefficients approach, and corresponding standard errors were derived via the delta method.

Using the IVW method, two-sample MR analysis identified 15 gut microbial taxa that showed significant causal associations with KSD (Fig.2and TableS1). Seven microbial taxa were identified as having inverse associations with KSD risk, indicative of protective influences. Notable examples included Phascolarctobacterium (OR = 0.928, 95% CI [0.880, 0.978],P= 0.006), members of the family Ruminococcaceae (OR = 0.930, 95% CI [0.879, 0.983],P= 0.011), bacteria belonging to Bacteroidales (OR = 0.934, 95% CI [0.891, 0.980],P= 0.005), and the genus Prevotella (OR = 0.964, 95% CI [0.935, 0.993],P= 0.017). Conversely, eight other taxa showed positive associations with increased KSD susceptibility. Among these, the order Clostridiales exhibited the strongest effect size and highest statistical significance (OR = 1.222, 95% CI [1.108, 1.349],P= 6.32 × 10−5), followed by G_Oscillibacter (OR = 1.181, 95% CI [1.044, 1.337],P= 0.008), Subdoligranulum (OR = 1.107, 95% CI [1.014, 1.207],P= 0.022), and Bacteroides (OR = 1.020, 95% CI [1.001, 1.039],P= 0.041). Furthermore, to rule out reverse causation, we performed reverse-direction MR analyses positioning KSD as exposure and GM taxa as outcomes, revealing no significant evidence to support reverse causal relationships (TableS2).

In terms of immune cell-related traits, IVW analysis identified 35 phenotypes significantly linked to KSD susceptibility (Fig.3, TableS3). Among them, 16 immune traits were negatively correlated with KSD, indicative of protective effects. Representative examples included the absolute count of naive CD4-CD8- T cells (OR = 0.949, 95% CI [0.904, 0.996],P= 0.034), CD64 expression on CD14- CD16 + monocytes (OR = 0.954, 95% CI [0.913, 0.997],P= 0.036), and absolute counts of central memory CD4-CD8- T cells (OR = 0.962, 95% CI [0.927, 0.999],P= 0.042). On the other hand, 19 immune phenotypes exhibited positive correlations with elevated risk of KSD, including CD28 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells (OR = 1.045, 95% CI [1.015, 1.076],P= 0.003), CD8 expression levels on central memory CD8 + T cells (OR = 1.055, 95% CI [1.002, 1.111],P= 0.040), terminally differentiated CD4 + T cells as a percentage of total CD4 + T cells (OR = 1.064, 95% CI [1.014, 1.118],P= 0.012), and CD8 expression on CD28 + CD45RA- CD8 + T cells (OR = 1.065, 95% CI [1.009, 1.125],P= 0.023).

The 35 immune traits were further classified into functional groups, encompassing eight regulatory T cell (Treg) markers, eight monocyte subsets, six mature T cell traits, five TBNK cell subsets, three B cell phenotypes, three conventional dendritic cell (cDC) markers, and two myeloid cell subsets. Tregs and monocytes emerged as the most represented categories, with CD4 + Tregs identified as the predominant subtype among the Tregs. Monocyte subsets comprised CD14 + CD16-, CD14- CD16+, and CD14 + CD16 + populations. While CD14- CD16 + and CD14 + CD16- monocytes demonstrated protective effects against KSD, CD14 + CD16 + monocytes showed variable impacts, with certain subtypes increasing and others decreasing KSD risk. Within mature T cells, CD4 and CD8 were the primary surface markers; CD4- and CD8- T cells exhibited protective associations, whereas CD4 + and CD8 + T cells correlated with higher risk.

After establishing 15 GM taxa and 35 immune cell phenotypes significantly associated with KSD, we subsequently explored causal relationships between GM and immune traits (TableS4) and conducted mediation MR analyses (TableS5). Prevotella abundance notably demonstrated a positive causal link with CD28 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells (OR = 1.078, 95% CI [1.022, 1.138],P= 0.006). Mediation analyses indicated that CD28 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells mediated the genetic protective influence of Prevotella on KSD (mediation effect β = 0.003, 95% CI [< 0.001, 0.007]; mediation proportion = −9.019%,P= 0.044) when considering Prevotella as protective (IVW: OR = 0.964, 95% CI [0.935, 0.993],P= 0.017) (Fig.4; Table1).

Assessments using Cochran’s Q statistic and MR-Egger intercept tests indicated an absence of notable heterogeneity or directional pleiotropy in our MR analyses concerning GM, immune phenotypes, and KSD susceptibility (allP> 0.05; TablesS6–S8). Additionally, leave-one-out sensitivity tests and scatter plots verified the robustness of mediation MR outcomes, while funnel plots indicated symmetry, suggesting no evident publication bias or heterogeneity (Figs.S1–S3). Forest plots provided detailed visual summaries of individual SNP-level causal estimates included in the MR analyses (Fig.S4).

In recent years, growing attention has been directed toward the GM as a pivotal modulator of host immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis, with substantial evidence implicating its involvement in the occurrence, progression, prevention, and therapeutic management of KSD [9]. Earlier MR-based studies have revealed important causal links between specific gut microbial taxa (particularly Oxalobacter and Haemophilus) and susceptibility to KSD [22]. Such findings have provided critical mechanistic insights into KSD pathophysiology and offered a basis for interventions focused on microbiota modulation or immune regulation. Nonetheless, the possibility that immune cells mediate the causal interactions between GM and KSD remains unexplored. Therefore, the current study comprehensively evaluated the causal relationships among GM, immune cell characteristics, and KSD risk, identifying potential immune-mediated pathways through which particular microbial taxa influence kidney stone formation. Our results highlight Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Ruminococcaceae as protective genera, while Clostridiales and Bacteroides were associated with increased KSD risk. In addition, we identified multiple immune cell subsets significantly linked to KSD, particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocyte subtypes. Through mediation analysis, we propose the hypothesis that the protective effect of Prevotella on KSD was partially mediated by CD28 on CD39 + CD4 + T cells, providing novel causal evidence for the “gut–immune–kidney” axis.

Recent studies have emphasized the crucial role of metabolic processes in the pathogenesis of KSD. The GM maintains a complex and interactive relationship with host physiology, actively contributing to multiple metabolic pathways, especially nutrient absorption and utilization. Increasing evidence indicates that GM dysbiosis significantly contributes to kidney stone development [23]. Certain gut bacterial taxa, including Oxalobacter formigenes, Enterobacter, Dorea, and multiple Lactobacillus species, possess oxalate-degrading capabilities and have consistently shown associations with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone formation [24–27]. Besides CaOx stones, alterations in GM composition have been linked to other stone types. For example, fecal Bacteroides abundance in patients suffering from uric acid stones has a positive correlation with serum uric acid concentration [28], and patients with stones exhibit significantly elevated Bacteroides levels relative to healthy controls [29,30]. The MR analyses conducted in the present study yielded robust and previously unreported evidence indicating that increased abundance of Bacteroides is causally linked to elevated KSD susceptibility. Although earlier literature reported decreased Subdoligranulum levels within the gut microbiota of uric acid nephrolithiasis patients [31], the positive correlation between Subdoligranulum abundance and KSD risk identified here aligns closely with findings from another recent MR-based study [22]. Such an inconsistency highlights the necessity of further research, either through larger microbiome sequencing cohorts or mechanistic experiments, to precisely define Subdoligranulum’s function in the pathogenesis of KSD. In addition, the observation from our analysis regarding Phascolarctobacterium abundance negatively correlating with KSD risk further supports conclusions drawn from prior study [32].

In the present study, we identified Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiales act as protective and risk factors for KSD, respectively, opposing the conclusions of an earlier MR study [33]. The discrepancy likely stems from population-specific variations in GM composition derived from distinct GWAS datasets, influenced by geographic, genetic, and lifestyle factors that differentially modulate KSD pathogenesis. Notably, emerging evidence from a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) study demonstrates that restoration of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and its metabolic functions significantly reduces hyperoxaluria-induced urinary oxalate excretion and renal CaOx deposition [34]. This study further provides mechanistic support for our observation of Ruminococcaceae’s protective role in KSD. Future studies should combine strain-level MR analyses, multi-ethnic cohorts, and gnotobiotic model validation, complemented by metabolomic profiling and microbial genetic fine-mapping to fully elucidate host-microbiome-disease interaction mechanisms in KSD.

Beyond its well-established role in regulating host metabolism, the GM also contributes to the pathogenesis of KSD through immune modulation within the local microenvironment. Excessive inflammation during stone formation may induce urinary tract damage and alter urine composition [5]. Indeed, nearly all major chronic inflammatory biomarkers exhibit elevated levels in KSD patients [35]. Renal crystal deposition, particularly CaOx, frequently triggers localized immune responses in kidney tissues [36], reinforcing the role of immunological pathways in kidney stone development. Unlike prior research predominantly centered around oxalate metabolism or isolated metabolic processes, the current study underscores immune cells as potential mediators within the GM–KSD causal pathway. Our MR analyses indicate that Prevotella influences KSD susceptibility partly through the mediation of CD28 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells, representing a mediation effect of approximately − 9.019%. This finding suggests a negative feedback mechanism in the “gut–immune–kidney” axis: increased Prevotella abundance may trigger immune responses that diminish its protective effects against KSD, while reduced Prevotella levels may attenuate pro-inflammatory immune activity. Although this immune-mediated pathway accounts for a relatively small portion of the overall causal relationship, immune cells are key regulators in complex biological networks [37], pointing to the involvement of additional mechanisms such as metabolic disturbances and oxidative stress [38].

Prevotella, a core GM (approximately 4.81% relative abundance), plays essential physiological roles in dietary fiber fermentation to generate butyrate [39] and oxalate metabolism regulation [40]. Current research demonstrates significant associations between Prevotella abundance variations and multiple pathological conditions, including urolithiasis [29], metabolic syndromes [41], autoimmune diseases [42], and neuropsychiatric disorders [43], with its colonization dynamics being substantially influenced by geographical distribution and nutritional patterns. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is a primary energy source for colonocytes and strengthens intestinal mucosal integrity [44]. It also modulates immune responses through mechanisms such as activating PPARα [45] and inhibiting NF-κB activation [46], ultimately suppressing inflammatory cytokine production. CD28 on CD39 + CD4 + T cells are a regulatory T cell (Treg) subset with immunosuppressive potential. CD28 provides co-stimulatory signals crucial for T cell activation [47], while CD39 hydrolyzes extracellular ATP to adenosine, which has anti-inflammatory effects. In tumor microenvironments, CD39 + CD4 + T cells have been implicated in immune suppression and tumor progression [48]. During renal inflammation, CD4 + T cells are recruited to sites of inflammation, enhancing macrophage activity and dendritic cell antigen presentation through IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion [49], thereby establishing a pro-inflammatory environment conducive to stone formation.

These results suggest that Prevotella-associated immune responses may involve complex biological mechanisms, and that modulating specific gut microbes or immune cell subpopulations could offer novel therapeutic strategies for KSD. Moreover, our study identified various monocyte subtypes, including CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, that are associated with KSD risk. Some of these subtypes appear to have bidirectional effects, implying that inflammation in stone formation is not exclusively promotive—certain immune cells may exert protective effects at specific stages of disease progression. These findings merit further investigation through experimental validation.

Recent advances from GWAS have considerably deepened our understanding of KSD’s genetic underpinnings. However, most previous GWAS research has not distinguished among kidney stone subtypes such as CaOx, cystine, or uric acid stones. A prominent trans-ancestry GWAS conducted by Hao et al. identified 59 loci linked to kidney stone susceptibility (including 13 novel loci), demonstrating conserved genetic mechanisms across European and East Asian populations involving pathways of calcium metabolism (e.g., RGS14), vitamin D regulation (e.g., CASR), and urate transport (SLC17A3) [50]. While candidate genes such as AGXT (oxalate metabolism) and SLC3A1/SLC7A9 (cystine transport) suggest subtype-specific genetic associations [51]. Future studies incorporating detailed stone composition analyses and functional validation are warranted to elucidate precise genotype-phenotype correlations and facilitate personalized prevention strategies.

From a methodological viewpoint, this investigation utilized a two- stage MR framework integrated with IVW estimation, heterogeneity assessment, pleiotropy detection, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to enhance robustness in causal inference. Additionally, mediation MR approaches quantified the proportion of GM’s impact on KSD risk attributable to immune cell mediation, offering enhanced depth and interpretability relative to traditional MR analyses. Nevertheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. Primarily, all datasets were exclusively derived from cohorts of European ancestry, potentially constraining generalizability and introducing ethnic bias into the findings. Second, although the immune-mediated effects were statistically significant, their absolute magnitudes were relatively modest, suggesting the presence of additional biological pathways—possibly metabolic or oxidative—that warrant further investigation. Future research should incorporate longitudinal, multi-ethnic cohorts, multi-omics approaches such as metagenomics and single-cell immunomics, and mechanistic studies using animal models and in vitro systems to comprehensively elucidate the “gut–immune–kidney” axis in KSD. Moreover, integrated interventions involving targeted probiotics and immune-modulating therapies should be explored in high-risk populations.

In summary, this study systematically implemented a two-stage MR analytical framework to clarify biological mechanisms through which specific gut microbial taxa influence KSD via immune cell mediation. A notable finding, Prevotella influencing KSD risk through the mediation of CD28 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells, underscores the significance of the “gut–immune–kidney” axis in KSD pathogenesis. These novel insights provide foundational support for preventive and therapeutic approaches targeting microbiota and immune pathways simultaneously. Future studies combining multi-omics profiling with functional validation will be instrumental in advancing mechanistic understanding and clinical translation in this domain.
