Although endocrine therapies, alone or in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, have led to notable improvements in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, progression is inevitable for most patients. We report dose escalation and expansion data from a trial of H3B-6545 (a novel selective ER covalent antagonist that inactivates wild-type and mutant ERα) in women with locally advanced/metastatic ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer (BC).

This study was a multicenter, open-label, phase 1/2 trial. Women ≥ 18 years of age with ER+, HER2 − BC whose disease progressed on their most recent therapy were eligible. Prior therapy must have included at least 2 hormonal therapies (HTs), or 1 HT and 1 chemotherapy, or 1 HT and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In phase 1, H3B-6545 was administered orally once daily at doses of 100–600 mg. In phase 2, the efficacy of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in phase 1 was examined in additional patients, including those with/without ERα mutation. The primary endpoints were RP2D determination (phase 1) and objective response rate (ORR) (phase 2, investigator-assessed per RECIST v1.1). Additional primary endpoints (phase 2) included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), per Kaplan-Meier estimates.

151 Patients were treated across phases. During phase 1, 2 DLTs (drug eruption and fatigue, both grade 3) were observed at the 600 mg dose, and 450 mg was deemed the RP2D. In the total population (phases 1 and 2), all patients experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 50.3% had grade 3–4 TEAEs, with no grade 5 TEAEs observed. In phase 1, the overall ORR was 7.5% (95% CI 1.6–20.4). The ORR in all response-evaluable patients treated at 450 mg (n= 94) was 20.2% (95% CI 12.6–29.8). Patients with clonalESR1Y537S mutation had an ORR of 32.1% (95% CI 15.9–52.4). For all patients who received H3B-6545 450 mg, median PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI 3.5–6.7) and median OS was 21.5 months (95% CI 16.6–25.5).

Results suggest that H3B-6545 may be further investigated as an endocrine therapy option for patients with previously treated metastatic ER + BC.

In total, approximately 70% of breast cancers (BCs) are driven by estrogen and express estrogen receptors (ERs) [1]. Several ER-directed therapies have been developed to antagonize the oncogenic ER alpha (ERα) function in pre- and postmenopausal women with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer [2,3]. Although these endocrine therapies (ETs) have demonstrated efficacy and have become a cornerstone of ER-positive (+) BC treatment [3], innate and acquired resistance remains a major challenge [4]. Notably,ESR1gene mutations, which occur in approximately 20–40% of patients with metastatic BC who have received prior ET, have been linked to ET resistance [5]. In this population, the Y537S variant is particularly challenging to treat due to its propensity for constitutive activation of ER, its variable impact on the efficacy of selective ER degraders (SERD), and its observed association with poorer clinical outcomes [3,6–8]. Therefore, Y537S may be a more formidable resistance mechanism compared with otherESR1variants in the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer.

Although the addition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors to ET (ET + CDK4/6 combination therapy) has led to notable improvements [9–12], progression remains inevitable for most patients [13]. Furthermore, patients with ER + advanced/metastatic BC treated with ET after prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment have shown limited or poor treatment efficacy outcomes [3,7]. Thus, novel agents are required to achieve additional improvements in treatment efficacy.

H3B-6545, a novel selective ER covalent antagonist that inactivates wild-type and mutant ERα by targeting cysteine 530 and enforcing antagonist conformation, has shown promising activity as a monotherapy in the nonclinical setting [14]. Selective ER covalent antagonists (SERCAs) targeting cysteine 530 on the ER could be advantageous over non covalent SERDs for heavily pretreated ER+, HER2- breast cancer [15]. These covalent SERCAs could overcome resistance by ensuring irreversible binding, leading to stronger and longer-lasting antitumor effects. In heavily pretreated patients with likely endocrine resistance, SERCAs offer a novel mechanism with promising early clinical data, suggesting they could improve outcomes [16]. We report on an open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 trial designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of H3B-6545 and to characterize the safety and efficacy of this monotherapy in heavily pretreated women with advanced or metastatic ER+, HER2 − BC. H3B-6545 previously showed a tolerable safety profile and preliminary antitumor activity in a subset of this patient population, including potentially increased activity in patients withESR1Y537S clonal mutation [16], which has been associated with more aggressive disease relative to patients without the mutation [6]. We report full dose escalation and the expansion phase data from patients who received H3B-6545 monotherapy after disease progression on prior therapy, including patients withESR1Y537S clonal mutation.

The study design is summarized in Additional file 1 Fig.A1. In phase 1 of this multicenter, phase 1/2 trial (NCT03250676; Registered August 11, 2017), dose escalation followed a standard 3 + 3 cohort design until both the MTD and the RP2D were determined. H3B-6545 was administered orally once daily (QD) at a dose of 100 mg to 600 mg. No food intake was allowed 2 h before and 2 h after the dose. Patients continued to receive the drug daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, patient request, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of study by the sponsor. The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose cohort. The RP2D was not to exceed the MTD and was agreed on by the Safety Review Committee based on an integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, clinical benefit, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics data for all dose levels tested. In phase 2, the efficacy of the RP2D determined in phase 1 was examined in an expanded population of patients, including those with and without ERα mutation (including a clonalESR1Y537S mutation). Patients who had received the selected RP2D in phase 1 were included in the analyses for phase 2. Additional patients with a clonalESR1Y537S mutation were to be enrolled (per Protocol Amendment 6 [PA6]) to further characterize the efficacy of H3B-6545 in this subgroup of patients (Additional file 1 Fig.A1).

To assess the effect of food on pharmacokinetics (PK), 18 patients treated in phase 2 were assigned to the food-effect cohort. In the patients enrolled in the food-effect cohort, the patients were randomly assigned to receive the RP2D of H3B-6545 on cycle 1 day 15 (C1D15) in fasted or fed conditions, and each patient received the dose on cycle 1 day 22 (C1D22) in the untried conditions. For the “fasted” treatment, patients received a dose of H3B-6545 with 240 mL of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 h. For the “fed” treatment, patients were instructed to eat a high-fat meal (800–1000 calories, with approximately 50% of calories from fat) in 30 min or less and take a dose of H3B-6545 with 240 mL of water within 30 min after the start of the meal. In both treatments, no food was allowed for at least 4 h postdose. As a result of the PK interim analysis of the food-effect cohort, the effect of food on PK was limited. Therefore, patients enrolled under PA6 (and subsequent amendments) took their dose of H3B-6545 regardless of food conditions, whether fasting or after a meal.

This study was approved by each research site’s institutional review board or independent ethics committee and performed in accordance with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from participants before study enrollment.

Women ≥ 18 years of age with ER+, HER2 − BC whose disease progressed on their most recent anticancer therapy were eligible. ER + diagnosis was histologically and/or cytologically confirmed by a local laboratory, and HER2 − diagnosis was as defined by the American Society for Clinical Oncology College of American Pathologists guidelines [17]. Eligible patients had adequate bone marrow and organ function, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and were either postmenopausal or premenopausal/perimenopausal and concurrently given a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist starting at least 4 weeks before the start of trial therapy and planned to continue LHRH during the study. Prior therapy must have included a minimum of 2 hormonal therapies, or 1 hormonal therapy and 1 prior chemotherapy, or 1 hormonal therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Patients enrolled under PA6 or subsequent amendments received prior therapy, including at least 1 prior hormonal therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Up to 1 prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting was allowed. Additional criteria for patients enrolled under PA6 or later amendments are included in Additional file Supplementary Methods.

The primary endpoints were the occurrence of DLTs as a function of the dose of H3B-6545 for determination of the MTD and/or RP2D (phase 1) and objective response rate (ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response [BOR] of confirmed partial response [PR] or complete response [CR]; phase 2). Additional primary efficacy endpoints for phase 2 included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (proportion of patients with a BOR of CR, PR, or stable disease ≥ 7 weeks), clinical benefit rate (CBR; the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR, PR, or durable stable disease [≥ 23 weeks]), progression-free survival (PFS, defined as the time from first dose date to the date of the first documentation of confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurs first), and overall survival (OS, defined as the time from first dose date to the date of death [event] or date last known alive or data cutoff date, whichever comes first [censored]). Secondary endpoints included preliminary efficacy (phase 1), safety, and PK (phases 1 and 2).

Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and every 8 weeks after starting the study drug until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response and progression were assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Adverse events were monitored and recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Blood samples for PK assessment were collected at predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h postdose on cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) and C1D15 in phase 1, or at the same time points on C1D15 and C1D22 for the patients enrolled in the food-effect cohort of phase 2. Plasma concentrations of H3B-6545 were measured by a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method.

Descriptive statistics for all continuous measures were tabulated and reported. Time-to-event endpoints (DOR, PFS, and OS) were reported using Kaplan-Meier estimates. For PFS, patients who did not have disease progression or death information were treated as right-censored observations at the time of the last response evaluation. Evaluation of safety was performed on the safety analysis set (all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug) with the exception of the determination of the MTD during phase 1, which was based on all patients who were evaluable for DLTs in cycle 1 of phase 1. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 or later.

PK parameters were calculated from plasma H3B-6545 concentrations by noncompartmental analysis using actual blood sampling times. The following PK parameters were calculated for each day: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time at which Cmaxoccurs (tmax), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h postdose (AUC(0–24 h)). Additionally, apparent total clearance following oral administration at steady state (CL/F) was calculated for C1D15 and C1D22. Accumulation ratios of Cmaxand AUC(0–24 h)were also calculated for phase 1 by dividing the values on C1D15 by those on C1D1. For the food-effect cohort of phase 2, a mixed-effect model analysis was performed on the natural logarithm transformed Cmaxand AUC(0–24 h)to assess the effect of a high-fat meal on H3B-6545 PK. In the model, treatment (“fasted” or “fed”), period, and sequence were included as fixed effects and patient nested in sequence was included as a random effect. The geometric least squares (LS) mean ratios (fed/fasted) of the back-transformed Cmaxand AUC(0–24 h), and its 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.4 (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey) was used for the PK analyses.

In total, 151 female patients (47 in phase 1 and 104 in phase 2) were treated within the study. In the total population (across phases 1 and 2), 3 (2.0%) patients remained on treatment at the time of data cutoff (November 30, 2022). All patients in phase 1 and the majority of patients in phase 2 (96.2%) discontinued treatment, primarily due to disease progression (76.6% in phase 1 and 80.8% in phase 2). Patient disposition as of the data cutoff date (November 30, 2022) is shown in Additional file 1 Fig.A2. The median duration of study treatment across both phases was 2.89 months (range, 0.2, 33.1). The median dose intensity per patient was 427.27 mg/day (range, 97.3, 600.0).

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for patients in phases 1 and 2 are shown in Table1. In the total population, the median age was 61.0 years; most patients were White (84.1%), had anESR1mutation in their tumor (62.3%), and had measurable disease (93.4%).

During phase 1, 2 patients treated at the 600 mg dose level experienced DLTs of grade 3 drug eruption (n= 1) and grade 3 fatigue (n= 1). DLTs were not observed in any other dose groups; thus, 450 mg was deemed both the MTD and the RP2D.

An overview of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by dose level in phases 1 and 2 is shown in Table2. In the total population of patients treated across phases 1 and 2 (safety analysis set), all patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, and 50.3% of patients had grade 3–4 TEAEs. No grade 5 TEAEs were observed, and all deaths were due to disease progression. Serious TEAEs were observed in 23.2% of patients, and serious TEAEs related to study therapy were observed in 4.0% of patients. Any grade and grade 3–4 treatment-related TEAEs were observed in 89.4% and 25.2% of total patients, respectively. TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal, dose reduction, or interruption occurred in 8.6%, 20.5%, and 38.4% of patients, respectively.

The most frequent any-grade TEAEs (≥ 40% of patients) were nausea (46%), sinus bradycardia (44%), and diarrhea (41%). In the 450 mg cohort (including 11 patients from phase 1 and 104 patients from phase 2), all patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, and 52% of patients had grade 3–4 TEAEs; the most frequent any-grade TEAEs (≥ 40% of patients) in the 450 mg cohort were nausea (48%), diarrhea (47%), and sinus bradycardia (45%) (Table3).

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are listed by cohort in Additional file 1 TableA1. Across all dose groups (N= 151), notable AESI included bradycardia (n= 71; 47.0%), rash (n= 23; 15.2%) and QT prolongation (n= 15; 9.9%). Sinus bradycardia in particular was reported in 67 (44.4%) patients. Five (3.3%) patients, all in the 450 mg dose group, experienced grade ≥ 3 QT prolongation, and one QT prolongation event was considered serious. No sinus bradycardia events were grade ≥ 3 or serious, irrespective of dose group. Treatment was interrupted in 2 (1.3%) patients due to sinus bradycardia (450 mg dose group), 3 (2.0%) patients due to rash maculopapular (450 mg dose group), and in 2 (1.3%) patients due to QT prolongation (450 mg dose group). Dose reduction due to QT prolongation, sinus bradycardia and rash occurred in 3 (2.0%), 8 (5.3%) and 1 (0.7%) patient(s), respectively, across dose groups. Treatment was discontinued in 2 (1.3%) patients each due to QT prolongations (450 mg dose group) or rash maculopapular (450 mg dose group). Bradycardia and sinus bradycardia did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any patient, irrespective of dose group.

In phase 1, partial response was achieved in 3 patients, 1 from each of the 100 mg, 200 mg, and 450 mg dose cohorts. Tumor responses in response-evaluable patients treated at 450 mg (including subsets of patients treated before/after PA6 and those with clonalESR1Y537S mutations) are summarized in Table4. The ORR in all response-evaluable patients treated at 450 mg (n= 94, including 8 patients from phase 1) was 20.2% (95% CI 12.6–29.8). The median duration of response was 9.23 months (95% CI 5.88–20.24). The clinical benefit rate was 41.5% (95% CI 31.4–52.1). Patients treated at 450 mg before (n= 73) and on/after PA6 (n= 21) had ORRs of 16.4% (95% CI 8.8–27.0) and 33.3% (95% CI 14.6–57.0), respectively, and CBRs of 38.4% (95% CI 27.2–50.5) and 52.4% (95% CI 29.8–74.3), respectively. Patients with clonalESR1Y537S mutation had an ORR of 32.1% (95% CI 15.9–52.4) and a CBR of 57.1% (95% CI 37.2–75.5).

PFS and OS in patients treated at 450 mg who received at least 1 dose of the study drug (total patients treated at 450 mg [n= 115] and the subset of patients with clonalESR1Y537S mutation treated at 450 mg [n= 28]) are shown in Fig.1. The median follow-up time for PFS was 14.5 months (95% CI 11.0–16.5). Median PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI 3.5–6.7) for all patients who received H3B-6545 450 mg and 7.3 months (95% CI 3.1–11.1) for patients with clonalESR1Y537S mutations. The median follow-up time for OS was 36.4 months (95% CI: 35.1–38.3). The median OS in patients treated at 450 mg who received at least 1 dose of the study drug was 21.5 months (95% CI 16.6–25.5). Overall survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 84.6% (95% CI: 76.4–90.1) and 71.3% (95% CI 61.8–78.9), respectively. For patients with clonalESR1Y537S mutation, the median OS was 18.6 months (95% CI 10.9–not estimable). PFS and OS in patients per dose group are shown in Additional file 1 Fig.A3.

The efficacy by key subgroups in all patients treated at the 450 mg dose level is shown in Additional file 1 TableA2. Antitumor activity was generally observed irrespective of prior treatment (type or number of therapies) and baseline tumor characteristics subgroups. Notably, in patients withESR1clonal Y537S mutations, ORR was 32.1% (95% CI 15.9–52.4).

Plasma H3B-6545 concentration-time profiles of phase 1 are shown in Fig.2. PK parameters of phase 1 are shown in Additional file 1 TableA3. Plasma H3B-6545 concentrations reached Cmaxaround 2–4 h postdose and showed a mono-exponential decline. PK parameters (Cmaxand AUC(0–24 h)) increased with increasing doses, and especially increased more than dose-proportionally after a single dose on C1D1. Accumulation ratios of Cmaxand AUC(0–24 h)were less than 2 for all dose levels, indicating only slight accumulation after multiple administrations. Plasma concentration-time profiles of the food-effect cohort of phase 2 are shown in Additional file 1 Fig.A4. PK parameters and statistical analysis results to assess the food effect are shown in Additional file 1 TableA4and TableA5, respectively. The geometric mean ratios of Cmaxand AUC(0–24 h)showed that the H3B-6545 exposures were 51% and 53% higher, respectively, under fed conditions with high-fat meal than fasted conditions. The median tmaxwas 6 h under fed conditions and 4 h under fasted conditions. The absorption of H3B-6545 appeared to be delayed under fed conditions.

Existing ER-directed therapies, including the SERDs elacestrant [3] and imlunestrant [12], have demonstrated efficacy in patients with ER-positive BC. However, resistance to SERDs and other ER-directed therapies is a major challenge to durable treatment response, particularly in patients withESR1gene mutations [5,15]. SERCAs, including H3B-6545, have recently been introduced in an effort to support this unmet treatment need [15,18].

In the present study, H3B-6545 was tolerable and had a manageable safety profile at doses up to 450 mg QD in this first-in-human study of women with advanced or metastatic ER+, HER2 − BC, as evidenced by low dose reduction (26.1%) and discontinuation (9.6%) rates in patients who received the 450 mg dose. Additionally, a low rate of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs related to study therapy was observed, with no DLTs with dosages < 600 mg QD. Although sinus bradycardia, QT prolongation, and rash were observed, the associated rates of study drug discontinuation were very low. Sinus bradycardia and QT prolongation were reported as a TEAE in 67 (44.4%) and 15 (9.9%) patients across dose groups. None of the sinus bradycardia were grade ≥ 3 or serious. Five (3.3%) patients experienced grade ≥ 3 QT prolongation and 1 experienced an event of QT prolongation that was considered serious, both in the 450 mg dose group. Sinus bradycardia did not lead to study drug discontinuation. QT prolongation led to study drug discontinuation in 2 (1.3%) patients in the 450 mg dose group. Sinus bradycardia led to dose reduction in 8 (5.3%) patients (across dose groups) and dose interruption in 2 (1.3%) patients, both in the 450 mg dose group. QT prolongation led to dose reduction in 3 (2.0%) patients (across dose groups) and dose interruption in 2 (1.3%) patients, both in the 450 mg dose group. These events were carefully monitored and generally manageable with dose modification for continuous anticancer treatment.

H3B-6545 showed promising antitumor activity in pretreated female patients with ER+, HER2 − BC, including in patients withESR1clonal Y537S mutation, which is notable given that this mutation has been associated with more aggressive disease [6]. Median PFS was 4.60 months among all patients who received 450 mg and 7.33 months in those withESR1clonal mutations. It should be noted theESR1Y537S subgroup sample size was small (n= 28) and therefore further research in a larger population is needed for further confirmation. Partial responses and tumor shrinkage were seen across subgroups, including in patients withESR1clonal Y537S mutation. The CBR was 41.5% in total patients who received 450 mg and 57.1% in theESR1clonal Y537S subgroup of patients who received 450 mg. Notably, the antitumor activity of H3B-6545 did not appear to be confounded by fewer prior lines of therapy in patients with clonalESR1Y537S mutation. In fact, patients who received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy demonstrated a slightly longer median PFS of 8.87 months compared with those only receiving 2 prior lines (7.52 months), suggesting H3B-6545 retained activity even in heavily pretreated patients. Furthermore, appreciable antitumor activity was observed in patients with ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy, as shown by an ORR of 38.5% and a CBR of 76.9%, indicating that H3B-6545 can exert an effect even in a more refractory disease setting (Additional file 1 TableA2). Overall, antitumor activity was generally observed across dose groups, including in patients with visceral metastases and patients who received prior fulvestrant and/or novel oral SERDs, prior CDK4/6 inhibitors, and/or prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. These data highlight a potential advantage of H3B-6545 in the treatment landscape. H3B-6545 may also be further investigated to provide a new oral endocrine therapy option especially for patients with previously treated ER + BC, includingESR1-mutant BC. Additionally, the combination of H3B-6545 300 mg with palbociclib was deemed to be tolerable and showed promising preliminary antitumor activity, indicating potential for combination therapy [19]. Heterogeneous tumor responses were seen across mutation subgroups. In contrast to tumors harboring clonal Y537S mutations, those with clonal D538G mutations exhibited minimal antitumor activity (median PFS 3.55 months, ORR 0.0%), although the CBR was 29.4%. The polyclonal Y537S and D538G subgroup also showed limited activity (median PFS 2.61 months, ORR 0.0%, CBR 33.3%).

Due to the limited population size and different populations, comparisons between our study and others (i.e., VERONICA and EMERALD) should be made with caution. However, in heavily pretreated patients, the median PFS of H3B-6545 450 mg in this study (4.6 months) was notable in the context of the median PFS of elacestrant (2.8 months; 3.8 months in the ESR1 subgroup) in EMERALD, and of venetoclax plus fulvestrant/fulvestrant (2.69/1.94 months) in VERONICA [3,7]. H3B-6545 also showed a numerically longer median PFS of 7.33 months in theESR1Y537S subgroup, compared with the 5.5 months seen with imlunestrant monotherapy in theESR1population in EMBER-3 [12]. Notably, the imlunestrant/abemaciclib combination in EMBER-3 achieved a PFS of 9.4 months, underscoring the potential of combination strategies. These findings suggest that SERCAs like H3B-6545 hold promise in this challenging landscape, particularly for patients withESR1mutations.

In PK analyses, blood exposure to H3B-6545 increased in a dose-dependent manner, especially more than dose-proportionally after a single dose. Slight accumulation of H3B-6545 was observed after multiple administrations. The high-fat meal, which has the maximum effects on drug absorption, increased blood exposure to H3B-6545 by approximately 50%. Therefore, the food effect on H3B-6545 PK was not considered clinically significant.

In this study, H3B-6545 had a manageable safety profile while showing antitumor activity. Encouraging clinical activity was also observed in patients withESR1Y537S mutation, which is particularly notable given the link betweenESR1mutations and ET resistance shown in extant studies. These results suggest that H3B-6545 may be further investigated to potentially offer a new oral endocrine therapy option for patients with previously treated metastatic hormone receptor-positive BC, includingESR1-mutant BC.
