The effect of balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) on hemodynamics in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), assessed using time-resolved three-dimensional cine phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (4D flow CMR), remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic features of the pulmonary artery (PA) before and after BPA and the diagnostic performance of 4D flow CMR-derived hemodynamics before BPA to predict the achievement of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) < 30 mmHg after BPA.

Twenty-one patients with CTEPH who underwent 4D flow CMR before and after BPA were retrospectively enrolled. Regarding 4D flow CMR, the analysis included peak flow volume and velocity at the main PA and peak systolic wall shear stress (WSS).

Seventeen patients achieved a mPAP < 30 mmHg after BPA. Peak flow velocity at the main PA (262.8 ± 52.3 mm/s vs. 298.5 ± 68.3 mm/s,p= 0.015) and peak WSS (0.97 ± 0.26 Pa vs. 1.13 ± 0.37 Pa,p= 0.044) both increased after BPA compared to their values before BPA. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict mPAP ≥ 30 mmHg after BPA based on peak flow velocity and peak WSS before BPA. The analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.926 (p< 0.001) for peak flow velocity before BPA (sensitivity, 0.765; specificity, 0.750; cut-off, < 251 mm/s) and 0.971 (p< 0.001) for peak WSS before BPA (sensitivity, 0.882; specificity, 1.00; cut-off, < 0.89 Pa).

Based on the study results, 4D flow CMR imaging showed improvement in hemodynamics after BPA. Furthermore, peak flow velocity and peak WSS were useful metrics for predicting the achievement of catheter-based BPA goal of mPAP < 30 mmHg with a better prognosis.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized by pulmonary hypertension, with an organized thrombus due to an incompletely resolved acute pulmonary embolism [1]. Persistent thromboembolism in the pulmonary artery (PA) elevates pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), eventually resulting in right heart failure or death, if left untreated [2].

Patients with CTEPH with mPAP ≥ 30 mmHg have poor prognoses [3]. Invasive treatments are typically considered for symptomatic drug-refractory CTEPH [2]. For patients with peripheral vasculopathy of segmental or subsegmental vessels unsuitable for pulmonary artery endarterectomy (PEA) [3], balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is indicated [4]. BPA reduces PVR and mPAP, resulting in symptom relief [2,5]. Therefore, mPAP < 30 mmHg is considered one of the goals following BPA.

Time-resolved three-dimensional cine phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (4D flow CMR) visualizes and quantifies the blood flow in large vessels and heart [6]. Few studies have investigated the hemodynamics in patients with CTEPH; however, the efficacy of BPA assessed using 4D flow CMR remains unclear.

Therefore, the present study aimed (1) to investigate the hemodynamic features of PA before and after BPA and (2) evaluate the diagnostic performance of 4D flow CMR-derived hemodynamics before BPA to predict the achievement of mPAP < 30 mmHg after BPA in patients with CTEPH.

As presented in Fig.1, this retrospective observational study initially recruited 25 consecutive patients with CTEPH scheduled for BPA at Hamamatsu University Hospital between December 2017 and December 2022. All patients underwent an initial right heart catheterization (RHC) and CMR, including 4D flow CMR, before BPA. After the exclusion of four patients without follow-up CMR, the remaining 21 patients who underwent follow-up RHC and 4D flow CMR were selected for the analysis. The diagnosis of CTEPH was based on the latest guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology [7,8] and Japanese Circulation Society [9] as appropriately. The time courses of the examinations were as follows: initial RHC and CMR within 1 month before the first BPA session, following serial BPA sessions, and follow-up RHC and CMR 3 months after the final BPA session. The decision to terminate any further additional BPA sessions was based on a comprehensive assessment, considering symptom improvement, the absence of treatable vessels, and mPAP levels after BPA. This study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hamamatsu University School of Medicine (approval ID 17–293). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

All patients underwent serological tests and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) within 1 month before the first BPA session and 3 months after the final BPA session. Serological test included N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Using TTE, we assessed the degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and maximum TR pressure gradient (TRPG). TR was qualitatively assessed using color Doppler echocardiography and graded visually on a 4-point scale as follows: trivial = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, and severe = 4. RHC parameters included mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), mPAP, PVR, cardiac output, and cardiac index measured using the Fick principle.

CMR examinations were performed using a 3 T scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA), with a maximum gradient strength of 50 mT/m and a maximum slew rate of 200 mT/m/ms; the scanner was used in combination with a commercially available 12-channel phased array body coil. Typically, two-dimensional (2D) cine images were obtained by fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images acquired using inversion recovery-prepared fast gradient echo (IR-FGRE) sequences in short-axis and vertical and horizontal long-axis orientations, with a slice thickness/gap of 10 mm/0 mm (6–9 slices). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed for geometric information of 4D flow CMR and area quantification of the PA. The following parameters were set: repetition time 2.7 ms; echo time 1.0 ms; flip angle 12 degrees, number of excitations, 1; field of view, 32 cm; matrix size reconstructed with the aid of zero fill interpolation, 224 × 224; receiver bandwidth, 83.3 kHz; and imaging time, 33 s for 4 phases. A bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol (Gadovist, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany) was administered at an injection rate of 2.0 mL/s, followed by the administration of 20 mL of saline. 4D flow CMR provides time-resolved 3D voxel data, each with 3D flow velocity components. Imaging parameters used for coronal 3D Fourier transform FSPGR-based 4D flow CMR were as follows: repetition time 4.5–5.0 ms; echo time 2.0 ms; flip angle 15 degrees; number of excitations 1; field of view, 32 cm; matrix, 224 × 224; 2-mm thickness; 60 partitions; 20 phases per cardiac cycle; velocity encoding, 200 cm/s; and receiver bandwidth, 83.3 kHz. The temporal resolution was 58.8 ± 10.8 msec. Respiratory-compensated retrospective cardiac gating was performed. The resulting imaging time was approximately 10 min, with a reduction factor of two for auto-calibrating the reconstruction for Cartesian sampling. Raw data of the 4D flow CMR were transferred to a personal computer (Intel Xeon E3-1270 [3.4 GHz/Quad-core] DDR3, 16 GB ECC, Linux) and reconstructed.

Right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume index (RVEdVI), RV end-systolic volume index (RVEsVI), and RV stroke volume index (RVSVI), all indexed with body surface area using the Du Bois formula, and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and main PA diameter just above the pulmonary valve at the end-diastolic phase were measured using Cardiac VX software (GE Healthcare). RV stroke volume divided by RV end-systolic volume (RVSV/RVEsV), as a right ventricular-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) coupling parameter [10], was calculated.

4D flow CMR and MRA datasets were formatted using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and analyzed on a personal computer. Segmentation, visualization of flow patterns, and calculations of flow velocity and volume and wall shear stress (WSS) were performed using commercially available software (Flova; R’-Tech Co., Hamamatsu, Japan). In particular, the regions of interest, including the main, right, and left PAs, were determined for the 4D flow CMR and MRA datasets. Segmentation was performed for vascular wall structures from 3D MRA datasets at the peak of the R wave, with magnitude images of 4D flow CMR, using the region growing method. The shapes were created using the marching cubes method. The 3D flow information was interpolated using the 3D datasets. Three emitter planes traversing the bases of the main, right, and left PAs were manually set, and 3D streamline images were subsequently generated using the Runge–Kutta method.

PA flow was evaluated based on the 3D streamline with a spatial resolution of 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm in each timeframe. In addition, PA flow patterns were evaluated in the main, right, and left PAs for the presence of vortical or helical flow in the entire cardiac cycle, the duration of vortical or helical flow, and the presence of vortical or helical flow in systole, respectively. Vortical flow was defined as a rotational streamline with an axis orthogonal to the centerline of the vessel. Helical flow was defined as regional fluid circulation along the longitudinal axis of the vessel centerline, thereby revealing a corkscrew-like motion [11–13].

The flow volume curve at the base of the main PA was obtained using Flova. Blood flow parameters included peak flow volume and velocity at the base of the main PA, peak systolic WSS, and mean oscillatory shear index (OSI). Both WSS and OSI were measured with a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm and their distribution maps of the PAs were color-coded and visualized as 3D images. Temporal changes in the entire surface area-averaged WSS at the PA wall during one cardiac cycle were described, and peak systolic WSS and mean OSI were estimated. The Reynolds number (Re), fluid characteristics to predict the flow pattern of laminar flow or turbulence, was calculated at the main PA in each patient using the following equation: Re = ρVL/µ, where ρ: density = 1.05 g/cm3, µ: viscosity = 4.0 × 10−3Pa × s, V = area-averaged peak velocity, and L = vessel diameter at the base of main PA.

Continuous data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) or as medians with interquartile range (IQR), as appropriate. Categorical data were presented as numbers and percentages. Continuous variables were compared using the two-sided t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using the McNemar’s test.

PA flow patterns were evaluated by one observer (KO) and another independent observer (KS) to assess interobserver variability, and Cohen’s Kappa (κ) coefficient was calculated for qualitative evaluation and the intraclass coefficient for quantitative evaluation. Correlations were assessed using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and linear regression analysis.

Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 30.0 statistical software package (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA).

The baseline characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table1. The mean age of the participants was 60.7 ± 14.8 years, and 90.5% of all patients were women. Ten patients (47.6%) had moderate or greater TR. All patients were administered riociguat and oral anticoagulants (OACs), and one patient additionally received selexipag. Serum NT-proBNP level was 137.0 (86.0‒975.5) pg/mL before BPA and significantly decreased after BPA [59.0 (34.5‒151.0) pg/mL,p< 0.001]. The median (IQR) number of BPA sessions was 5.00 (4.00‒7.00). The distribution of patients according to the World Health Organization functional classification (WHO-FC) was as follows: 0 (0.0%) in class I, 10 (47.5%) in class II, 10 (47.5%) in class III, and 1 (4.8%) in class IV, while it improved significantly (p< 0.001) to 14 (66.7%) in class I, 5 (23.8%) in class II, 2 (9.5%) in class III, and 0 (0.0%) in class IV, respectively. The segmental branches treated by BPA were exhibited in Table2. The mean number of segments treated was 6.8 ± 1.9 in the right PA and 6.0 ± 1.6 in the left PA.

TRPG, as measured by TTE, significantly reduced 3 months after BPA compared to before BPA (59.9 ± 25.7 mmHg vs. 26.5 ± 13.3 mmHg,p< 0.001). mPAP (36.0 [32.0‒47.5] mmHg vs. 24.0 [21.0‒28.0] mmHg,p< 0.001) and PVR (6.1 [4.5‒11.9] Wood units vs. 3.4 [2.5‒4.4] Wood units,p< 0.001) significantly decreased 3 months after BPA compared to before BPA (Table2). However, four patients showed mPAP > 30 mmHg 3 months after the final BPA. RVEdVI (95.2 ± 17.8 mL/m2vs. 71.3 ± 17.9 mL/m2,p< 0.001), and RVEsVI (54.3 ± 17.6 mL/m2vs. 31.8 ± 12.0 mL/m2,p< 0.001) significantly reduced 3 months after BPA compared to before BPA. Furthermore, RVEF significantly increased 3 months after BPA compared to before BPA (44.1 ± 10.8 mmHg vs. 56.2 ± 8.5 mmHg,p< 0.001). RVSV/RVEsV significantly increased 3 months after BPA compared to before BPA (0.68 [0.56 ‒ 1.23] vs. 1.29 [1.07 ‒ 1.69],p< 0.001). Main PA diameter significantly reduced 3 months after BPA compared to before BPA (33.0 ± 4.0 mm vs. 30.6 ± 4.1 mm,p< 0.001). LGE was observed at the RV insertion point in 21 (100%) patients before BPA and did not change 3 months after BPA.

Representative streamline images of PA flow at the peak systolic phase before (Fig.2a) and after (Fig.2b) BPA revealed that the vortical flow pattern in the main PA did not change significantly, whereas flow velocity at the main PA increased after BPA. Three-dimensional WSS at peak systole revealed a relatively elevated WSS distribution in the anterior wall of the main PA before BPA (Fig.2c) and elevated WSS after BPA (Fig.2d). In addition, 3D OSI revealed relatively low values and similar distributions before (Fig.2e) and after (Fig.2f) BPA.

As presented in Table3, peak flow velocity (262.8 ± 52.3 mm/s vs. 298.5 ± 68.3 mm/s,p= 0.015) and peak WSS (0.97 ± 0.26 Pa vs. 1.13 ± 0.37 Pa,p= 0.044) significantly increased after BPA compared to before BPA, whereas the mean OSI remained unchanged. There was no significant change in the Reynolds number before and after BPA. As summarized in Table4, streamline images before BPA developed a vortical or helical flow in the main PA (n= 21, 100%), right PA (n= 16, 76.2%), and left PA (n= 14, 66.7%). The prevalence of vortical or helical flow during an entire cardiac cycle and only in systole and the duration of vortical or helical flow did not change after BPA. Interobserver variabilities in the presence of vortical or helical flow (kappa = 0.96) and the duration of the vortex or helix (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99) were excellent.

The intergroup comparisons based on mPAP value of 30 mmHg after BPA are summarized in Table5. In patients with mPAP < 30 mmHg (n= 17, 81.0%), peak flow velocity before BPA (278.4 ± 40.0 mm/s vs. 196.7 ± 50.0 mm/s,p= 0.039), peak flow velocity after BPA (321.5 ± 49.8 mm/s vs. 200.65 ± 46.4 mm/s,p= 0.006), and peak WSS before BPA (1.05 ± 0.20 Pa vs. 0.63 ± 0.19 Pa,p= 0.013) were significantly higher than in patients with mPAP ≥ 30 mmHg. Patients with mPAP ≥ 30 mmHg were older (57.2 ± 13.3 years vs. 75.5 ± 12.5 years,p= 0.050).

Furthermore, intragroup comparisons before and after BPA based on mPAP of 30 mmHg after BPA are shown in Fig.3. In patients with mPAP < 30 mmHg, peak flow velocity (278.4 ± 40.0 mmHg vs. 321.5 ± 49.8 mmHg,p= 0.012) was significantly increased after BPA. Main PA diameter was significantly reduced after BPA in patients with mPAP < 30 mmHg (32.0 ± 3.0 mm vs. 29.6 ± 2.9 mm,p< 0.001) and patients with mPAP ≥ 30 mmHg (37.0 ± 5.9 mm vs. 35.2 ± 5.8 mm,p= 0.017).

Peak velocity before BPA and mPAP after BPA (Fig.4a,R= −0.695,p< 0.001) and peak WSS before BPA and mPAP after BPA (Fig.4b,R= −0.698,p< 0.001) had significant negative correlations.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis to predict mPAP ≥ 30 mmHg after BPA using peak flow velocity and peak WSS before BPA revealed an area under the curve of 0.926 (p< 0.001) for peak flow velocity before BPA (Fig.4C) and 0.971 (p< 0.001) for peak WSS before BPA (Fig.4D). The sensitivity and specificity were 0.765 and 0.750, respectively, for peak flow velocity before BPA, with a cutoff value of < 251 mm/s. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.882 and 1.000, respectively, for peak WSS before BPA, with a cutoff value of < 0.89 Pa.

In the present study, we demonstrated serial changes in PA hemodynamics using 4D flow CMR imaging in patients with CTEPH before and after BPA. Briefly, RVEdVI and RVEsVI decreased, RVEF increased, peak flow velocity at the main PA increased, and peak WSS increased after BPA compared to before BPA. When comparing patients with a post-BPA mPAP exceeding the reference value of 30 mmHg to those with mPAP ≤ 30 mmHg, significant differences were observed in peak flow velocity and peak WSS both before and after BPA. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of peak flow velocity and peak WSS before BPA in predicting the achievement of mPAP < 30 mmHg after BPA.

In this study cohort, we demonstrated the effect of BPA on RV-PA hemodynamics and cardiac function, namely, BPA reduced PVR and mPAP; however it did not increase cardiac output. In addition, we demonstrated changes in PA hemodynamics using 4D flow CMR, which showed an increase in peak flow velocity but not in peak flow volume. This finding is consistent with the cardiac output measured using RHC and stroke volume in cine CMR. Another insight from this study is that achievement of mPAP < 30 mmHg after BPA may be predicted by peak flow velocity before BPA using 4D flow CMR, even though pressure cannot be measured using 4D flow CMR.

Previous studies [2,14,15] have reported that BPA in patients with CTEPH improved WHO-FC, reduced BNP, reduced mPAP and PVR measured using RHC, reduced RVEdV and RVEsV, and increased RVEF measured using conventional CMR. Our results are consistent with those of the aforementioned studies. In addition, we observed an increase in RVSV/RVEsV and a decrease in the main PA diameter, which were associated with morphological reverse remodeling of the right ventricle and PA. RVSV/RVEsV has prognostic value in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Thus, an increase in RVSV/RVEsV may suggest improved outcomes in patients undergoing BPA.

In the present study, an increase in peak flow velocity at the main PA was observed. Although a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the main PA was also noted, which may partly account for the increase in peak velocity, no evidence of PA shrinkage or stenosis was observed. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that both the reduction in main PA area and the increase in peak velocity represent secondary changes associated with decreased PVR after BPA.

Despite the observed reduction in PVR and the increase in peak flow velocity as measured by 4D flow CMR, no significant increases were detected in cardiac output and index by RHC or conventional CMR, nor in peak flow volume by 4D flow CMR. There appears to be some divergence in the literature regarding changes in cardiac output and index following BPA. While previous studies reported significant improvements in cardiac index after BPA [5,16], the RACE trial [17] and the MR BPA randomized controlled trial [18] demonstrated that the increase in cardiac output following the initiation of riociguat was significantly greater than that observed after BPA. This suggests that riociguat may have already enhanced cardiac output, potentially masking the hemodynamic effects of BPA. Another possible explanation is the short interval between the final BPA session and the follow-up CMR and RHC evaluations, during which full recovery of RV function may not have been achieved.

A characteristic endpoint of 4D flow CMR is the visualization of a 3D flow in a time course of a cardiac cycle. Aberrant flow patterns, including vortical and helical flows in the PA, have been reported in patients with pulmonary hypertension, whereas flow patterns seem to be more prone to uniform axial flow in healthy participants [19–21]. The effect of BPA on flow patterns remains unclear. A significantly diminished vortical flow has been reported in a patient after BPA [22] and another patient after PEA [23]. However, in the present study, the prevalences of vortical and helical flows and their duration did not decrease after BPA, even though mPAP decreased and WHO-FC symptoms were relieved. In this regard, considering the mPAP cut-off value of 16.0 mmHg for the appearance of vortical flow [13], the mPAP after BPA in this study (24.0 [21.0–28.0] mmHg) was relatively high.

WSS is proportional to velocity and inversely proportional to vessel diameter under laminar flow conditions [24,25]. Although PA blood flow in patients with CTEPH was generally vortical or helical flow, the relationship between velocity, vessel diameter, and WSS remained consistent with the uniform axial flow model mentioned above, where higher velocity and smaller vessel diameter both led to increased WSS. However, the WSS on the PA surface was heterogeneous, with an uneven PA surface and diameter, complex bifurcation anatomy, and complex hemodynamics with vortical or helical flow. Therefore, the use of 3D WSS measurement on 4D flow CMR or computational fluid dynamics may provide more accurate and comprehensive assessments. Physiological WSS in healthy individuals has a favorable effect on endothelial function [24]. WSS in patients with pulmonary hypertension is lower than that in healthy individuals [19,26–29]. Schäfer et al. reported that the WSS of the PA correlated with stiffness and elasticity in the PA [30]. Thus, precise assessment of WSS is thought to be essential for the better management in patients with CTEPH.

In such cases, invasive RHC is performed 3 months after BPA to assess whether mPAP had decreased sufficiently. In the present study, we predicted the achievement of the BPA goal using peak flow velocity and peak WSS derived from non-invasive 4D flow CMR. Therefore, 4D flow CMR may help to understand the clinical course and decide the treatment strategy of CTEPH including additional vasodilator or further BPA sessions.

This study had several limitations. First, this was a single-center study with a small sample size. However, we believe that the patient characteristics in this study represent the characteristics of patients with CTEPH who undergo BPA because patients with CTEPH in our institution were consecutively recruited. Second, this study did not include healthy participants; instead, we focused on the differences in variables before and after BPA. Third, all the patients were administered pulmonary vasodilators, which may have affected their PA hemodynamics. However, the medication dose was maintained throughout the study. Fourth, Fourth, although previous studies have evaluated detailed hemodynamics in CTEPH using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [31–33], the present study lacked CFD-based validation, which may have enhanced the accuracy of 4D flow CMR measurements. Fifth, the VENC of 200 cm/s is relatively high for detecting the slower flow velocities, which may have compromised the accuracy of WSS and diastolic flow. However, this VENC setting allowed for the measurement of accelerated blood flow, which can occur in CTEPH, without aliasing. Finally, we could not determine the benefits of hemodynamic changes after BPA owing to the study design.

In the present study, 4D flow CMR showed an improvement in the hemodynamics of patients with CTEPH before and after BPA. Finally, peak flow velocity and peak WSS were useful metrics for predicting the achievement of the BPA goal with a better prognosis. Therefore, non-invasive 4D flow CMR potentially predict invasive RHC. A large-scale follow-up study is warranted to determine the benefits of BPA and hemodynamic assessment using 4D flow CMR for further PA remodeling.
