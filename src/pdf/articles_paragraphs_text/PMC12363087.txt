Stroke remains a major cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Early identification of individuals at high risk is essential for prevention. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), a novel indicator integrating acute and chronic glycemic states, has shown prognostic value in acute illness. However, its association with stroke risk in community populations and its potential interaction with hypertension remain unclear.

This retrospective cohort study included 9682 stroke-free participants aged ≥ 45 years from the 2011 baseline of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), followed through 2020. SHR was calculated using fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Participants were categorized by median SHR and hypertension status into four groups. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations with incident stroke over a median follow-up of 8.43 years. Subgroup, stratified, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

During 81,601 person-years of follow-up, 764 incident stroke cases were documented, with an overall incidence of 9.36 per 1000 person-years. Compared to the reference group (low SHR without hypertension), those with high SHR and hypertension had the highest stroke risk (hazard ratio: 2.94, 95% confidence interval: 2.38–3.64). SHR and hypertension were independently associated with stroke risk, and their combination demonstrated a dose-response relationship. Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent findings across sex and age strata. The combined SHR-hypertension model showed improved discriminative ability (area under the ROC curve: 0.653). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.

Elevated SHR is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, and its predictive value is enhanced when combined with hypertension. SHR may serve as an integrated metabolic marker reflecting both acute stress and chronic risk burden. Incorporating SHR into stroke risk assessment tools may improve early identification and enable more targeted prevention strategies, particularly in hypertensive populations.

The Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio (SHR) has been identified as a predictor of poor prognosis in acute illnesses such as myocardial infarction and sepsis.

SHR reflects acute glycemic stress relative to chronic glycemic status, offering a more nuanced assessment than absolute glucose measures.

The role of SHR in predicting chronic disease outcomes, such as stroke, has not been well established, especially in community populations.

This study is the first to demonstrate that elevated SHR, particularly when combined with hypertension, significantly increases stroke risk in a large, nationally representative cohort.

SHR was associated with stroke risk independently of traditional risk factors, and its predictive value was enhanced in hypertensive individuals.

SHR may serve as an integrated metabolic stress marker, reflecting both acute and chronic metabolic dysregulation.

Incorporating SHR into stroke risk assessment models may have the potential to improve early identification of high-risk individuals, especially among patients with hypertension, enabling more targeted preventive strategies.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide [1,2]. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally [3–7]. In particular, the incidence, recurrence, and disability rates of stroke have been rising continuously in low- and middle-income countries, imposing substantial burdens on healthcare systems and national economies [8]. In China, the country with the largest population, stroke affects more individuals than anywhere else in the world. Its high incidence, high disability rate, and high recurrence rate have emerged as a serious public health challenge, particularly among middle-aged and older adults [9–11]. Therefore, identifying risk factors associated with stroke and promoting early intervention strategies are essential for reducing stroke incidence and improving clinical outcomes.

In recent years, the Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio (SHR) has emerged as a novel indicator for evaluating glucose metabolism disturbances under acute stress. Initially applied in studies involving critically ill patients, SHR has demonstrated predictive value for adverse outcomes in conditions such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sepsis [12–14]. Unlike absolute blood glucose levels, SHR takes into account glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), thereby offering a more accurate reflection of acute hyperglycemic states. Although studies have supported the prognostic significance of SHR in various critical illnesses [15], its role in predicting the risk of stroke remains unclear. Moreover, the potential interaction between SHR and hypertension in relation to stroke risk has yet to be systematically examined. It also remains uncertain whether SHR, as a marker of metabolic stress, can be used to predict the risk of chronic diseases.

To further clarify the predictive utility of SHR for stroke onset and to evaluate its potential interaction with hypertension, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). By following participants enrolled at baseline in 2011 for a period of nine years, this study aims to provide epidemiological evidence to support the early identification and stratified management of individuals at high risk for stroke.

This study is a secondary analysis of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative population-based cohort study of Chinese adults aged 45 years and older (http://charls.pku.edu.cn/), which commenced in 2011. Follow-up health surveys have been conducted biennially, with four waves completed by 2020. Participants were recruited from both rural and urban areas across 150 counties or districts in 28 provinces of China using a multi-stage stratified probability proportional sampling method. At each wave, trained investigators conducted face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires to collect sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle behaviors [16,17]. For the present study, participants from the baseline survey (2011–2012) were included, and follow-up assessments were performed in the subsequent four waves (2013–2014, 2015–2016, 2017–2018, and 2019–2020). The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Fig.1. Ultimately, a total of 9,682 participants were included in the final analysis.

Participants who were followed up less than twice (n = 924), including those who died from any cause before the second follow-up, were excluded to minimize potential competing risk bias.

The CHARLS study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of Peking University (IRB00001052-11015). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrollment in the CHARLS study. This study was reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

Fasting venous blood samples were collected by medical personnel from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention following standardized protocols and analyzed at the Clinical Laboratory Center of You’anmen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Plasma glucose was measured using the enzymatic colorimetric method, while HbA1c was quantified by boronate affinity high-performance liquid chromatography. The coefficients of variation for plasma glucose and HbA1c measurements were 0.9% and 1.9%, respectively. The SHR was calculated using the following formula[18]. Participants were stratified based on the median baseline SHR into a low SHR group (SHR ≤ median) and a high SHR group (SHR > median). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, self-reported physician diagnosis of hypertension, or current use of antihypertensive medication [19]. To further investigate the combined effect of SHR and hypertension, subjects were categorized into four groups: low SHR without hypertension (reference group), high SHR without hypertension, low SHR with hypertension, and high SHR with hypertension.

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of new stroke events during the follow-up period, defined as participants without a prior history of stroke at baseline who were newly diagnosed with stroke by a physician during follow-up. Data were collected through structured questionnaires, specifically by asking the key question: "Have you ever been diagnosed with a stroke by a doctor?" Stroke events were confirmed based on participants’ self-reported physician diagnosis, a clearly documented diagnosis date, or evidence of ongoing stroke treatment [20,21]. The time to stroke event was defined as the interval from baseline assessment to the date of first confirmed diagnosis. For participants without stroke during follow-up, the follow-up duration was defined as the interval from baseline assessment to the date of the last survey [22,23].

Trained interviewers collected sociodemographic and health-related information during the first wave of the survey using structured questionnaires. Sociodemographic variables included sex, age, educational attainment (no formal education, primary school, middle or high school, college or above), marital status (married, others), and household registration status (rural, urban). Health-related data encompassed self-reported smoking and alcohol consumption status (yes/no), self-reported physician-diagnosed medical conditions (diabetes), and use of antidiabetic medication. The incident of cardiac events was defined based on a self-reported physician’s diagnosis: “Has a doctor ever told you that you had any heart disease (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, or other heart problems)?”. This study also incorporated basic anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circumference [WC]), physical examinations (blood pressure, pulse), and laboratory test results, including white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), triglycerides (TG), C-reactive protein (CRP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and total cholesterol (TC). To address missing data and minimize potential bias, multivariate imputation for missing continuous variables was performed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation method [24,25]. Prior to imputation, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, WC) were screened and corrected for outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method; extreme values beyond 1.5 times the IQR were winsorized to boundary values to avoid biasing the imputation results. Subsequently, missing values in continuous variables were imputed using the KNN algorithm with the number of neighbors set to 5 (n_neighbors = 5). Imputation was limited to numeric variables, and the resulting completed dataset was used for all subsequent analyses. Detailed information regarding the extent of missing data and outlier correction is provided in Supplementary File, Table S1.

All statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.11). All participants were categorized into four groups based on their SHR and hypertension status. Continuous variables were described and compared between groups according to their distribution. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Variables approximating a normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and group differences were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Non-normally distributed variables were summarized as median and IQR, and differences were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test. Categorical variables were described as frequencies (percentages), and intergroup comparisons were performed using the Chi-square test. Additionally, overall distributions of categorical variables (counts and composition ratios) were calculated and reported. To further explore the biological correlates of SHR, we performed a supplementary descriptive analysis comparing selected metabolic and inflammatory markers between participants with SHR above and below the median. The results are presented in Supplementary Table S2. All tests were two-sided, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was applied to estimate stroke-free survival probabilities across exposure groups. Survival curves were first compared between hypertension and non-hypertension groups, as well as between high and low SHR groups (dichotomized by median). Furthermore, participants were stratified into four groups according to SHR and hypertension status: (1) low SHR without hypertension, (2) high SHR without hypertension, (3) low SHR with hypertension, and (4) high SHR with hypertension. SHR was also analyzed as a continuous variable to enhance the robustness of results. Group differences were compared using the log-rank test. Stroke incidence rates were calculated per 1,000 person-years, defined as the number of stroke events divided by the total accumulated person-years of follow-up, multiplied by 1,000, reflecting the incidence risk within the population over time. To examine potential multicollinearity between SHR and other covariates, tolerance and variance inflation factors (VIF) were evaluated. Due to collinearity with other predictors, TC was excluded from the final multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (Supplementary File: Table S3). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations of different SHR-hypertension combinations, hypertension status, and SHR status with stroke risk, using the reference group as the baseline. To further assess the stratified predictive value of SHR, we conducted subgroup analyses based on hypertension status, age (45–59 years and ≥ 60 years), and sex. Three models with incremental adjustment were constructed: Model 1 was unadjusted; Model 2 adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, household registration type, marital status, and diabetes; Model 3 further adjusted for metabolic and inflammatory markers including CRP, uric acid, BUN, Cr, HBG, WBC, TG, HDL and a history of cardiovascular disease sented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To assess the predictive value of SHR and hypertension for stroke occurrence, logistic regression models were established and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. Initially, two univariate models were constructed with SHR (continuous) and hypertension (binary) as independent variables, respectively, and stroke occurrence (yes/no) as the dependent variable; area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated to evaluate predictive performance. Subsequently, SHR and hypertension were combined in a joint model, and predicted probabilities were used to plot a combined ROC curve, further assessing the predictive ability of their joint effect. The AUC quantified the discrimination ability of the models.

To assess the robustness and reliability of the study findings, five sensitivity analyses were conducted. Sensitivity analysis 1, we excluded participants with incomplete follow-up records to mitigate potential attrition bias and ensure that associations were examined in a fully observed cohort. Sensitivity analysis 2, a complete-case analysis was performed by excluding individuals with missing covariate data, thereby verifying the stability of the results within a high-quality dataset. Sensitivity analysis 3, to evaluate whether underlying glucose metabolism disorders confounded the observed associations, participants with self-reported diabetes or use of antidiabetic medications were excluded. Sensitivity analysis 4, we applied an alternative SHR classification based on the optimal cutoff value (1.086) identified through statistical methods (e.g., Youden’s index), with detailed methodology presented in Supplementary File, Figure S1. Sensitivity analysis 5, to enhance external validity, we conducted an additional analysis using a previously reported SHR threshold of 1.0 from existing literature. Across all sensitivity analyses, the main results remained consistent, supporting the robustness of our findings. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for each analysis are provided in Supplementary File, Figure S2. All analyses were performed using Python (version 3.11).

Table1presents the baseline characteristics of the 9682 participants included in the study, of whom 46.7% were male, with a median age of 58.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 51.0–65.0). Based on the combined stratification of SHR and hypertension status, participants were categorized into four groups: low SHR (≤ median) without hypertension (reference group, n = 3059), high SHR (> median) without hypertension (n = 2784), low SHR with hypertension (n = 1787), and high SHR with hypertension (n = 2052). The median SHR value was 1.025. Significant differences were observed among the four groups across multiple characteristics (allP< 0.05). With the increasing burden of both elevated SHR and hypertension, there was a trend of increasing age, WC, TG, CRP, TC, BUN, and other metabolic parameters, while HDL-C levels progressively decreased. Notably, the group with SHR above the median combined with hypertension exhibited the highest proportion of abnormal metabolic indicators, suggesting a potentially greater stroke risk burden in this subgroup.

As shown in Table2, during a median follow-up of 8.43 years (totaling 81,601 person-years), a total of 764 stroke events were documented, yielding an overall stroke incidence rate of 9.36 per 1000 person-years. Group-specific analyses revealed the lowest stroke incidence in the low SHR (≤ median) without hypertension group (4.92 per 1000 person-years), whereas the highest incidence was observed in the high SHR (> median) with hypertension group (17.57 per 1000 person-years), demonstrating a progressive increase in stroke risk associated with elevated SHR levels and the presence of hypertension. Further subgroup analyses indicated that stroke incidence was significantly higher in males (10.29 per 1000 person-years) compared to females (8.56 per 1,000 person-years), and markedly higher in participants aged ≥ 60 years than those aged 45–59 years (12.59 vs. 7.03 per 1000 person-years), as detailed in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, across all subgroups, a clear dose–response relationship was observed between SHR quartiles and stroke incidence, with risk increasing progressively alongside SHR levels. The highest risk was noted in the fourth quartile (Q4), particularly pronounced among hypertensive and elderly individuals (Figs.2D–E). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis further corroborated these findings. Over the entire follow-up period, participants with SHR above the median combined with hypertension exhibited significantly higher cumulative stroke risk compared to other groups (Log-rank test,P< 0.001; Figs.2A–C). Moreover, when comparing survival curves stratified separately by SHR groups and hypertension status, higher cumulative stroke incidence was observed in the high SHR group and the hypertension group, respectively (Figs.2A–B), suggesting that both SHR and hypertension are independent risk factors for stroke and may exert a synergistic effect (Fig.2C).

This study systematically evaluated the independent and joint effects of SHR and hypertension status on stroke incidence risk by constructing three multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models (Table3). The results demonstrated that both high SHR (SHR > median) and hypertension were significant predictors of stroke risk. In Model 3, participants with SHR above the median exhibited a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.07–1.43,P= 0.005), while hypertension was associated with an HR of 2.53 (95% CI 2.16–2.95,P< 0.001). The concurrent presence of high SHR and hypertension was linked to a markedly elevated stroke risk (HR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.38–3.64,P< 0.001). However, in participants with elevated SHR but no hypertension, the association with stroke was not statistically significant after full adjustment (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.87–1.41,P= 0.408), as shown in Table S4. This suggests that SHR’s predictive value is more context-dependent and becomes more evident when metabolic stress co-occurs with vascular burden (i.e., hypertension). Further cross-stratified analyses by sex and age subgroups revealed that this joint effect was consistent across populations, with individuals exhibiting both SHR > median and hypertension consistently showing significantly higher stroke risk compared to other groups (Table S4). In contrast, participants with elevated SHR but no hypertension did not demonstrate a statistically significant association with stroke risk in the fully adjusted model (P> 0.05;Table S4). Additional subgroup analyses stratified by hypertension status, sex, and age based on SHR categories (Table4) indicated that the association between elevated SHR and stroke risk more pronounced among individuals with hypertension, male participants, and those aged ≥ 60 years. These associations remained statistically significant (P< 0.05) across all three adjusted models, suggesting that these subgroups may exhibit greater vulnerability to stroke under conditions of metabolic stress reflected by high SHR. Hypertension remained an independent and statistically significant predictor of stroke risk across all demographic groups (P< 0.05) (Table S5). Moreover, SHR was categorized into quartiles and Cox regression analyses were conducted for the overall cohort as well as by sex and age subgroups (Table S6). Although the highest quartile (Q4) consistently exhibited greater stroke risk compared to the lowest quartile (Q1), displaying a dose–response trend, most differences among quartiles did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for confounders (P> 0.05). Table S7 and S8 provide further breakdowns of the relationship between SHR and stroke risk, stratified by hypertension status, sex, and age. These results reinforce our previous findings, showing that elevated SHR is more strongly associated with stroke risk in hypertensive individuals, men, and those aged ≥ 60 years (P< 0.05).

As shown in Fig.3, the AUC for the SHR model was 0.539, indicating weak predictive ability. The hypertension model demonstrated moderate predictive performance with an AUC of 0.640. When SHR and hypertension were combined in a joint model, the AUC increased to 0.653, suggesting that the combined prediction modestly improved the identification of stroke risk.

The ROC curve for the SHR model alone yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.539, indicating limited predictive ability. The hypertension model demonstrated moderate performance with an AUC of 0.640. When SHR and hypertension were combined in a joint model, the AUC increased to 0.653, suggesting that integrating both factors modestly improves the identification of individuals at risk for stroke.SHR, stress hyperglycemia ratio; HTN, hypertension; AUC, area under the curve; ROC, receiver operating characteristic.

In all sensitivity analyses, SHR combined with hypertension status showed significant stroke risk (p< 0.05) in Group 3 (SHR ≤ median & Hypertension) and Group 4 (SHR > median & Hypertension), while no significant difference was observed between Group 2 (SHR > median & No Hypertension) and Group 1 (SHR ≤ median & No Hypertension) (p> 0.05). In Sensitivity Analysis 1 (TableS9-12), excluding participants with incomplete follow-up data, the results remained consistent. SHR was significantly associated with stroke risk in the total population (p< 0.05), but only in hypertensive individuals, not in non-hypertensive individuals. Further stratified analysis showed significant findings in hypertensive individuals aged ≥ 60, but no significant associations in younger hypertensive groups or non-hypertensive individuals (p< 0.05). Sensitivity Analysis 2 (Table S13-16) confirmed stronger HRs for SHR in hypertensive individuals aged ≥ 60. Sensitivity Analysis 3 (Table S17-20), excluding diabetic participants and using the 1.023 SHR cut-off, showed a stronger predictive advantage for men than women, with stronger associations in older and hypertensive groups. Sensitivity Analysis 4 (Table S21-24), using the 1.086 SHR cut-off, yielded similar findings, further supporting SHR’s stronger association with stroke risk in older hypertensive populations. Sensitivity Analysis 5 (Table S25-28) confirmed similar trends, supporting the robustness of SHR in predicting stroke risk in the overall population. However, in the hypertensive subgroup, the association between high SHR and stroke risk was not statistically significant in older adults and men, unlike in the general population where it remained significant.

Based on nationally representative data from middle-aged and older adults, this study systematically evaluated the independent and combined effects of SHR and hypertension on stroke incidence. The results demonstrated a significant association between elevated SHR and increased stroke risk, with the highest incidence observed in individuals exhibiting both high SHR and hypertension. These results suggest that SHR may be a relevant metabolic parameter linked to stroke susceptibility, particularly among hypertensive individuals.

Previous studies have confirmed that SHR serves as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in various clinical settings, including sepsis [12,13], acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [7,26], acute coronary syndrome [27,28], elderly hospitalized patients [14], heart failure complicated by acute kidney injury [29], and cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) patients [30]. Building upon these clinical investigations, our study further extends the application of SHR to stroke, a chronic and complex disease.

This study validated the potential value of the SHR in stroke risk prediction, particularly in the presence of concomitant hypertension. By constructing a joint exposure model based on SHR levels (dichotomized by median) and hypertension status, we observed a significant increase in stroke risk when both SHR and hypertension were elevated, demonstrating a clear dose–response relationship. This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors, supporting a possible synergistic interaction between SHR and hypertension that exacerbates the risk of cerebrovascular events. Importantly, SHR alone was not significantly associated with stroke risk in normotensive individuals. This lack of association highlights the context-dependent nature of SHR and suggests that its predictive utility is enhanced when baseline vascular burden—such as hypertension—is present. In this regard, SHR may serve more appropriately as a stratification indicator in high-risk subpopulations rather than a universal stand-alone predictor of stroke [31]. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating clinical context when interpreting glycemic stress indicators in risk models. Further multidimensional stratified analyses revealed that elevated SHR was associated with higher HRs for stroke among males and individuals aged ≥ 60 years. These findings are consistent with those reported by Ben Hu et al., who noted that individuals with elevated SHR were predominantly older males [32]. Our study provides novel epidemiological evidence in a Chinese middle-aged and elderly community population, supplementing and expanding the existing literature on population-specific effects of SHR. Although Cox regression analyses based on SHR quartiles did not demonstrate statistically significant differences after multivariable adjustment, we consistently observed the highest stroke incidence in the Q4 group. This may be attributable to reduced sample sizes in some groups, limited statistical power, or a potentially non-linear relationship between SHR and stroke risk. Although the overall improvement in predictive performance with SHR is modest, our subgroup analyses indicate that SHR holds enhanced prognostic relevance in certain high-risk populations [33]. In particular, older adults and male individuals with hypertension exhibited significantly higher stroke risk associated with elevated SHR levels. These stratified findings (p< 0.05) suggest that SHR may contribute to a more personalized approach to stroke prevention by identifying individuals who may benefit from early intervention or intensified monitoring.

Based on the above findings, we emphasize the clinical relevance of SHR abnormalities as indicators of stress-related metabolic dysregulation and their association with increased cerebrovascular risk. This interpretation is supported by previous studies across diverse populations. For example, Yang et al. (2022) reported a U-shaped association between SHR and cardiovascular outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, with increased risk observed even at modest deviations from normoglycemia [28]. Similarly, Cao et al. (2025) found SHR values near 1.0 to be associated with the lowest mortality risk in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy [34]. Xie et al. (2023) observed that SHR > 1.08 predicted higher rates of MACE and mortality in dialysis patients with ACS [35]. In STEMI patients undergoing PCI, SHR > 1.2 was associated with in-hospital and long-term mortality (Wei et al.) [36]. Together, these studies show that SHR values exceeding normal glycemic expectations—typically between 0.9 and 1.2—are consistently associated with adverse outcomes, reinforcing the biological plausibility of SHR as a risk marker. Our own sensitivity analyses further confirmed that elevated SHR predicts stroke risk across different thresholds, supporting the robustness of this association. In summary, our study highlights SHR abnormality as a meaningful and generalizable indicator of metabolic stress. When combined with hypertension status, SHR can enhance early identification of high-risk individuals and support tailored prevention strategies in cerebrovascular disease.

Combined with relevant findings from existing literature, we sought to explore the potential underlying mechanisms to deepen the understanding of the biological basis of SHR as a predictive marker for stroke and to provide stronger theoretical support for its clinical translation. Firstly, compared with traditional glycemic indicators such as FBG and HbA1c, SHR integrates acute glucose levels with chronic baseline status, thereby more accurately reflecting the relative hyperglycemia during stress conditions [37,38]. FBG is susceptible to variations due to measurement timing and nutritional status [39], while HbA1c reflects long-term average glucose levels and is less sensitive to acute fluctuations40. In contrast, SHR reveals the extent of glucose elevation during stress relative to an individual's baseline metabolic level, potentially indicating vulnerability to metabolic stress or a state of “metabolic imbalance.” Stroke occurrence, particularly ischemic stroke, is often driven by a combination of long-term chronic pathological processes, such as atherosclerosis [41,42], and short-term precipitating factors, including metabolic stress [43,44]. The dysregulation represented by elevated SHR may exacerbate oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and systemic inflammatory responses [45,46], thereby promoting atherosclerotic plaque instability and thrombogenesis, which in turn increases the risk of stroke triggering. Moreover, our study observed an increasing trend in inflammatory markers (CRP) and metabolic indicators (TG, HDL-C) among individuals with higher SHR levels (Table S2) [46–50]. Therefore, although SHR is derived from acute measurements, its effectiveness in predicting chronic outcomes such as stroke may stem from its comprehensive reflection of both long-term metabolic status and short-term stress responses. This characteristic suggests that SHR may help identify individuals at higher risk of stroke among those with chronic conditions such as hypertension, indicating its potential relevance in risk stratification.

This study has several strengths. Firstly, it is based on the CHARLS dataset, which is nationally representative and includes a long follow-up period, providing a solid data foundation for assessing stroke risk factors. Secondly, the study systematically evaluated the independent and joint effects of SHR and hypertension in stroke risk prediction using multivariable Cox regression models, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the results [51–53]. Furthermore, the application of SHR in community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly populations for stroke risk prediction extends its utility from critical care management to public health screening and intervention for chronic diseases, offering new insights for the development of disease early warning models. Furthermore, the joint analysis of SHR and hypertension provides a more nuanced understanding of metabolic dysregulation in stroke pathogenesis, which has important implications for preventive strategies in high-risk populations.

However, there are several limitations to this study. Firstly, as an observational cohort study, while we controlled for multiple confounders, residual confounding and reverse causality cannot be fully excluded, which may affect the observed associations. Secondly, the calculation of SHR relied on single baseline measurements of blood glucose and HbA1c. This single-timepoint measurement may not accurately reflect the dynamic metabolic status of individuals over time, potentially limiting the predictive power of SHR for long-term metabolic changes. Third, stroke outcomes were determined based on self-reported physician diagnoses and follow-up interviews, rather than clinical adjudication or imaging confirmation. This may introduce recall bias, misclassification, and likely underestimation of asymptomatic or silent strokes, thereby limiting the precision of outcome assessment. Additionally, another limitation is that we did not apply formal competing risk models (e.g., Fine Gray subdistribution hazard models). Although we attempted to mitigate this issue by excluding participants with fewer than two follow-up visits, including those who died early, residual bias from unmeasured competing risks may still exist. Lastly, due to the unavailability of detailed subtype information, we were unable to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. As these subtypes may involve distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, the potential heterogeneous impact of SHR on different stroke types remains unclear and warrants further investigation in future research. We acknowledge that SHR may not yet fully replace other established predictors for clinical use. While its predictive capacity is still developing, SHR shows valuable potential, and further research is needed to better understand its real-world applicability. Its utility could be further enhanced when integrated into existing risk models, particularly for high-risk populations. Future prospective studies and external validation in independent cohorts will be crucial to explore SHR’s potential in improving stroke risk communication and guiding preventive interventions, especially for high-risk individuals such as older hypertensive males.

This large-scale, prospective cohort study among Chinese middle-aged and older adults shows that elevated SHR is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially among individuals with hypertension. Stratified analyses further suggest stronger associations in older adults and men. While SHR alone was not predictive in normotensive individuals, its combination with hypertension revealed meaningful associations, underscoring its potential utility in refining stroke risk stratification within high-risk subgroups. Although causality cannot be established, the observed associations provide novel epidemiological evidence and a foundation for future research into targeted prevention strategies and the mechanistic pathways linking SHR to stroke.
