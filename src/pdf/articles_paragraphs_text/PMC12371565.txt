Periodontal and cardiovascular diseases are prevalent chronic conditions sharing common pathogenic pathways involving bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on cardiovascular risk biomarkers, including endothelial function, systemic inflammation and thrombosis markers, and lipid and glucose metabolism, in patients with or without comorbidities.

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases, following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and supplemented by manual searches. Eligible studies were published after 2010, written in English, and involved adult patients with moderate to severe periodontitis treated with NSPT. Risk of bias was assessed for all included studies.

Sixteen studies were included. NSPT was associated with a significant reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), as well as with decreased HbA1c levels, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Improvements in endothelial function were observed, notably a reduction in endothelial microparticles (EMPs), although results across vascular parameters such as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and PWV were heterogeneous. Effects on lipid profiles were inconsistent and generally modest.

NSPT shows moderate to high clinical relevance by improving key cardiovascular biomarkers especially inflammation and glycaemic control with both healthy and comorbid patients. These findings support the integration of periodontal care into cardiovascular risk mana-gement strategies, though further research is needed to confirm effects on lipid metabolism and vascular function.

This systematic review aimed to study the impact of non-surgical periodontal therapy on cardiovascular risk biomarkers, such as endothelial function, markers of systemic inflammation and thrombosis and lipid and glucose metabolism, in patients with or without associated comorbidities.

Participants (P): Adult patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, with or without associated comorbidities.

Interventions (I): Non-surgical periodontal therapy included supra- and subgingival scaling, root planning and oral hygiene instructions.

Comparison (C): Comparisons of the effects of periodontal therapy on cardiovascular risk biomarkers between the test group (which received periodontal therapy) and the control group (which did not receive periodontal therapy or receive limited dental prophylaxis).

Outcome (O): The main outcomes were the levels of cardiovascular risk biomarkers, including endothelial function, markers of systemic inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The additional outcomes concerning the periodontal treatment were levels of clinical attachment, probing pocket depths and bleeding on probing.

Study design (S): Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected.

The literature search for articles published from 2010 to 2024 was carried out using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Scopus. A specific search equation was formulated for each database, using keywords and MeSH terms, as summarised in Table 1.

The method used was a systematic review of the literature. The research and article selection processes were carried out independently by two authors (CB and XS). The two reviewers manually searched for additional published papers that could meet the eligibility criteria of this study. The reviewers (CB and XS) independently performed a methodical analysis of all the study titles, abstracts, and full texts.

The titles and abstracts of the obtained articles were screened on the basis of the determined eligibility criteria. The full texts of the remaining studies were assessed by the same authors. The data of the included studies, when available, were extracted by both reviewers (CB and XS). A table was previously established to provide support for the collection of the following data: (1) Author, Year of Publication and Country; (2) study design; (3) number of patients (mean age ± SD); (4) follow-up; (5) study population; (6) intervention; (7) periodontal assessment; and (8) outcome measures.

The bibliographic search of all the sources identified 633 articles (624 from databases and 9 from other methods). Of these, 25 duplicate studies were removed via the reference manager EndNote. A total of 561 articles were excluded after the titles and/or abstracts were read, and 29 records were excluded since the reports were not retrieved. A total of 18 full-text records were read and analysed, and 2 more records were excluded because they were protocol studies, as shown in the PRISMA flowchart in Figure 1. Sixteen records met the inclusion criteria and were finally included in the systematic review.

The characteristics of the sixteen articles included are presented in Table 2, with detailed information on the study design, population characteristics, duration of follow-up, interventions, periodontal assessment, and cardiovascular outcomes.

The number of subjects included ranged from 18 to 135 in the control groups, whereas the test groups included between 18 and 212 patients. All participants in the test groups received periodontal therapy (supragingival plaque control, oral hygiene instructions, subgingival scaling, and root planning), whereas subjects in the control groups either did not receive any periodontal therapy or received only limited dental prophylaxis (supragingival plaque removal, oral hygiene instructions). Clinical follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months, with an average follow-up period of 3–6 months.

Some of the trials involved an otherwise healthy population (Ren et al, 201641, Caúla et al, 20146, Kapellas et al, 201416, Li et al, 201123, Kamil et al, 201115, and Taylor et al, 201053). Other trials focused on populations with comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients (Milanesi et al, 202233and Montero et al, 202035), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients (Seinost et al, 202049), coronary artery disease (CAD) patients (Montenegro et al, 201934and Saffi et al, 201843), prehypertensive patients (Zhou et al, 201765), patients with myocardial infarction (Lobo et al, 202028), coronary heart disease (CHD) patients (Bokhari et al, 20123), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (Kolte et al, 202319and Chen et al, 20127).

The reported outcome parameters of all trials can be divided into three groups: endothelial function; systemic inflammation and thrombosis; and lipid and glucose metabolism. The main results are described in Table 3.

Endothelial function has been assessed via various methods. Studies have investigated blood pressure, arterial diameter/stiffness via pulse wave velocity (PWD), the ankle-brachial index (ABI), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and vascular inflammation via PET/SCAN analysis. Two studies measured endothelial function by examining endothelial microparticles (CD34+, CD31+, CD42-…). Endothelial function tended to improve, and in particular, the concentration of endothelial microparticles was reduced in patients who had undergone periodontal therapy.

The majority of studies did not show a significant decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, TNF-α and fibrinogen levels after NSPT, both in the healthy population and in patients with comorbidities. Other inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers, including sVCAM-1/sICAM-1 and neopterin, which significantly decreased after NSPT, were studied. However, the concentrations of PAI-1 and von Willebrand factor (vWF) did not change after NSPT.

Lipid metabolism was assessed by measuring the concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-L, LDL-C and triglycerides. After NSPT, the values remained unchanged in the majority of the studies. However, two studies reported a significant reduction in TC in the TG. Glucose metabolism was assessed by measuring the HbAIc concentration, fasting blood glucose level and post-meal blood glucose level. There was a significant difference in the reduction in these markers in patients who underwent NSPT.

The analysis of the risk of bias, as described in Figure 2, revealed a low-to-moderate level of risk for all items across the different studies. The risk of selection, indication, and reporting bias is generally low due to the randomised nature of the included studies. The risk of attrition bias is mostly low or moderate, except in the study by Bokhari et al,3which had a high level of bias because only 80% of participants completed the study.

Risk of bias of included studies. Green indicates low risk of bias, orange indicates uncertain or moderate risk of bias, and red indicates high risk of bias.

Notably, the studies by Kolte et al,19Bokhari et al,3Chen et al,7and Kamil et al15have a moderate level of risk of bias, whereas the study by Kapellas et al16has a high risk of bias for the item ‘blinding of participants and personnel’. This performance bias could be explained by the lack of blinding of personnel or failure to report blinding. The comparability of the data between the test and control groups was very good, and no bias was detected.

Our systematic review focused on the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy on biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. This systematic review included 16 RCTs published between 2010 and 2024 to ensure a sufficient level of evidence and to strengthen the methodological robustness of this review. Six of these studies involved a healthy population, while the other ten included participants with cardiovascular or systemic comorbidities. The choice of including healthy patients or those with comorbidities enabled the results to be assessed on a population panel that was more representative of the general population. In addition, the review includes an extended analysis of several biomarkers linked to cardiovascular risk (endothelial function, inflammation, thrombosis, lipid and glucose metabolism), providing a comprehensive overview.

Initially, we investigated the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on endothelial function. The available studies allow us to conclude that the effect of periodontal treatment on endothelial function is positive but remains uncertain. To measure vascular function, we relied on assessments of arterial pressure, arterial stiffness (using various methods), vascular inflammation, and the concentration of endothelial microparticles.

With respect to the effects of NSPT on blood pressure and arterial stiffness, we observed a positive trend in the improvement of these parameters, which is in line with the scientific literature. However, this positive trend remains uncertain.29,36,50Two RCTs reported significant improvements in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values after NSPT. The data in scientific literature remains limited on this point and does not provide definitive conclusions. The improvement in arterial stiffness after NSPT is better documented in the literature.8,48Two meta-analyses have demonstrated an association between periodontal disease and increased arterial stiffness. However, the effect of periodontal therapy remains debatable. In this systematic review, only three RCTs reported improvements in endothelial function based on arterial stiffness measurements (via flow-mediated dilatation, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and carotid intima-media thickness).

One RCT examined vascular inflammation via PET/CT analysis. Although the conclusions did not show any improvement after periodontal therapy, the procedure appears to be promising. More studies are needed to compare results effectively.

Proinflammatory cytokines also have detrimental effects on cardiovascular risk. Several proinflammatory immune mediators are expressed and released into the circulation in response to local inflammation, affecting other organ systems. Inflammation in the periodontium has systemic repercussions.26,31,64In this study, four RCTs demonstrated a significant decrease in the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines following periodontal therapy.

One RCT examined cell adhesion molecules, which are biomarkers of inflammation. Saffi et al43reported an increase in these molecules in the control group but did not demonstrate a significant decrease in the periodontal therapy group. Few studies are available on cell adhesion molecules and their relationship with periodontal diseases.2,51,56Further investigations in this area would be beneficial.

According to the literature, there is a close link between periodontal diseases and fibrinogen levels.20,57However, a recent study was unable to establish a connection between periodontal treatment and a decrease in fibrinogen levels.1In this systematic review, two RCTs reported a significant decrease in fibrinogen levels after NSPT.

This review has several limitations. Firstly, there is considerable heterogeneity between the studies included, particularly in terms of the populations studied, treatment protocols, follow-up times and measurement methods. These disparities complicate a uniform analysis and restrict the generalisability of the results. Although the review covers a diverse population, the small size and limited geographical diversity of the studies analysed may hamper the representativeness of the conclusions. Furthermore, the relatively short duration of follow-up in most of the studies does not allow the long-term effects of periodontal treatment to be assessed. Finally, although the review establishes correlations between periodontal treatment and cardiovascular biomarkers, it does not investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. This review has several strong points. It addresses a relevant and topical subject, which is particularly important given the high prevalence of periodontal and cardiovascular disease. The inclusion of recent studies with a high level of evidence (RCT) guarantees reliable results in line with current scientific advances. In addition, the review explores a wide range of cardiovascular biomarkers, providing a comprehensive and detailed view of the potential effects of periodontal treatment on cardiovascular health.

NSPT shows moderate to high clinical relevance by improving several markers of vascular function (PWV, FMD, IMT, blood pressure) and systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) in both healthy and comorbid patients, with a notable benefit on glycaemic control (HbA1c, FPG), particularly in individuals with metabolic risk, although its effects on lipid profile remain limited and heterogeneous.

In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the growing evidence of the link between non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) and improved biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. By including 16 RCTs from diverse populations and exploring a wide range of biomarkers, the review provides a comprehensive perspective on the systemic effects of periodontal therapy. Positive trends were observed in endothelial function, arterial stiffness, inflammation, lipid profiles and glucose metabolism, suggesting that periodontal treatment may play a significant role in cardiovascular risk management. In particular, the significant reductions in CRP and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as improvements in certain lipid and glycaemic parameters, reinforce the strong interconnection between oral and cardiovascular health.

However, these results are tempered by major limitations, notably the heterogeneity of the populations studied, treatment protocols, follow-up times and measurement methods. These discrepancies prevent the results from being generalised, and underline the need for robust, standardised clinical trials with long-term follow-up. Furthermore, although correlations between periodontal therapy and cardiovascular biomarkers are apparent, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently explored.

Despite these challenges, this review highlights the potential of periodontal therapy to offer benefits beyond oral health, particularly for those at high cardiovascular risk. Future research should focus on filling the gaps identified, refining our understanding of the mechanisms involved and validating these findings. An interdisciplinary approach involving oral and cardiovascular health professionals is essential to optimise the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease through improved periodontal care.
