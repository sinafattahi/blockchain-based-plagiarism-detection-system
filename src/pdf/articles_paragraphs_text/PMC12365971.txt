Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a malignancy of the lymphatic system often associated with immune dysfunction. This case describes an 11-year-old boy presenting with epistaxis, petechiae, and thrombocytopenia (40 000/μl), initially diagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Further evaluation revealed lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A biopsy of an axillary lymph node confirmed HL, with immunohistochemical analysis identifying Reed-Sternberg cells positive for CD30 and CD15. The patient began treatment with the ABVD chemotherapy regimen, resulting in significant clinical and hematological improvement. While ITP is commonly associated with autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders, its occurrence as a secondary complication of HL is rare, reported in less than 1% of cases. This case emphasizes the importance of considering HL as an underlying cause in patients presenting with unexplained ITP, particularly when lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms are observed. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy are crucial for achieving positive outcomes in such cases.

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a malignancy of the lymphatic system, characterized by large, multinucleated Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells amidst benign inflammatory cells [1]. HL comprises approximately 10% of newly diagnosed lymphomas, more common in males, peaking in young adults and those over 60 [2].

Risk factors include viral infections, genetic predisposition, and immunosuppression, with increased risk for siblings of affected individuals. HL typically presents with lymphadenopathy, predominantly in the supradiaphragmatic region, and systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss [3].

HL commonly involves regional lymph nodes but may also involves extranodal sites as spleen, liver, lungs, and bone marrow [3].

Diagnosis involves lymph node biopsy with histological and immunohistochemical analysis, including markers like CD3, CD15, CD20, CD30, CD45, Pax-5, EBER, and LMP1 to identify HRS cells [4].

Treatment generally consists of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, using regimens such as ABVD (Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) or BEACOPP (Bleomycin, Etoposide, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, Procarbazine, Prednisone) [4].

It is notable that the association between Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and immune thrombocytopenia has been reported in only 48 cases from 1951 to 2009 [5].

An 11-year-old boy presented with a 5-day history of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, followed by the appearance of skin petechiae, ecchymoses, and episodes of epistaxis. Clinical examination revealed diffuse petechiae across the body and ecchymoses on both upper and lower limbs. Enlarged peripheral lymph nodes were palpable, including a 1x1 cm node in the neck behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle, a 1x1 cm axillary node, and a 0.5x1 cm inguinal node. All lymph nodes were mobile both at depth and with the overlying skin.

Laboratory investigations showed thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 40 000/μl, hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl, and a white blood cell count of 5400/μl. Immunoglobulin levels were within normal range. Given the clinical findings, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered as a differential diagnosis. Complement levels revealed slightly low C3 (72 mg/dl) and significantly low C4 (6.7 mg/dl), while tests for ANA, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies, as well as rheumatoid factor (RF), were negative.

A CT scan revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary and inguinal regions, along with splenomegaly. Bone marrow aspiration showed hypercellularity, with an active red series and normal myeloid series. However, further evaluation with a biopsy of the axillary lymph node provided evidence of lymphoma. Histopathological examination confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma, with scattered Reed-Sternberg-like cells positive for CD30 and CD15, observed in a lymphocyte-rich background (Fig. 1).

Reed-Sternberg cells identified in the lymph node biopsy, positive for CD30 and CD15.

The patient is currently undergoing treatment with Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine (ABVD regimen), which has shown improvement as evidenced by laboratory results: WBC count of 10 700/μl, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dl, and platelet count of 574 000/μl.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common hematologic condition affecting all demographics. Primary ITP refers to isolated thrombocytopenia without related illnesses, while secondary ITP involves other underlying causes. The prevalence of ITP was 9.5 per 100 000 children aged 1–5, 7.3 per 100 000 children aged 6–10, and 4.1 per 100 000 children aged 11–14 [6].

Secondary ITP occurs in two-thirds of cases following a viral infection, whether caused by direct infection or a viral vaccine. In some instances, bacterial infections may also contribute, also many cases of lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported as a cause of secondary ITP, albeit with varying percentages. ITP is associated with 1–5% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, whereas it is observed in less than 1% of cases of Hodgkin’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas [6]. Some studies report an even lower percentage, reaching as low as 0.2% [7], despite the very low percentage reported in the medical literature, it remains the focus of our study.

The majority of HL-ITP instances that were recorded happened after lymphoma was diagnosed, according to the study of Marino et al. [8], in contrast to our case, where the patient initially presented with ITP as the primary clinical manifestation, which was later found to be a complication resulting from Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

The disease clinically manifests with bleeding, which is commonly observed in mucosal surfaces such as epistaxis, in addition to purpura that appears without any prior warning, laboratory findings reveal that the primary characteristic of the disease is thrombocytopenia [6]. In our case, the clinical manifestations of the patient included epistaxis and purpura, and his platelet count was 40 000/μl.

Since one-third of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases are associated with ITP [6], it remains an important differential diagnosis. Therefore, several laboratory tests, this includes several autoimmune antibodies, were conducted for our patient, and the results were as follows; complement levels revealed slightly low C3 (72 mg/dl) and significantly low C4 (6.7 mg/dl), while other tests were negative. Thus, excluding the diagnosis of SLE.

The diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma relies on confirming lymph node enlargement, either through clinical examination or computed tomography (CT) imaging. However, a lymph node biopsy is essential for diagnosis, as Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells are histopathologically diagnostic [4]. The CT scan of our patient showed splenomegaly and several enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary and inguinal areas, also a biopsy of the axillary lymph node confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma, with scattered Reed-Sternberg cells positive for CD30 and CD15 (Fig. 1).

The treatment with ABVD showed an excellent success, considering an overall survival rate of 96.4% [9]. However, the patient has undergone treatment with Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine (ABVD regimen).

After one month of treatment and follow-up, the patient’s condition improved with the resolution of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and petechiae, also laboratory results showed significant improvement as detailed: a WBC count of 10 700/μl, a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dl, and a platelet count of 574 000/μl, confirming the secondary cause of thrombocytopenia.

This case demonstrates the rare presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma with immune thrombocytopenia as the primary clinical manifestation. Despite the rarity of HL-associated ITP, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, especially when evaluating cases of unexplained thrombocytopenia with accompanying lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy, as in our case, can lead to excellent treatment outcomes.
