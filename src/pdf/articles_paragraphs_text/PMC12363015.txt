Several studies have shown a connection between periodontal diseases and conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), and periodontitis.

A systematic study was conducted in seven databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Embase, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect) from 1960 to December 30, 2024. Articles investigating the relationship between periodontitis and IBD were selected based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the selected articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa checklist. The prevalence of periodontitis in individuals with and without IBD, as well as in each subgroup (UC and CD), was reported in terms of odds ratio (OR). Data analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta Analysis (CMA) software.

Eleven studies were included in this systematic review. Statistical analysis of 10 studies revealed that, compared to the control group (without IBD), IBD patients had a significantly higher likelihood of periodontitis (OR: 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.73–3). Within each IBD subgroup, the likelihood of periodontitis was higher compared to the control group. The risk of developing periodontitis in patients diagnosed with UC and CD was found to be (OR: 3.14; 95% CI: 2.11–4.66) and (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.4–2.83), respectively. However, this discrepancy was not statistically significant (P= 0.09).

IBD was associated with a higher likelihood of periodontitis compared to non-IBD patients. However, However, additional longitudinal research studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to validate this association and potentially reveal shared underlying mechanisms.

Oral and dental diseases are among the most common worldwide and negatively impact various aspects of individual and societal health [1]. Among the common oral diseases, periodontal disease is caused by bacteria’s penetration into the deeper tissues surrounding the teeth and periodontium. This, combined with the host’s defense response to microbial agents, leads to the destruction of the periodontium and loss of alveolar bone [2]. Furthermore, the loss of periodontal support significantly reduces chewing function and molar bite force [3]. The significant prevalence of periodontal disease contributes to the growing global burden of chronic non-communicable diseases [4]. Over the past decade, the prevalence of periodontal disease among adults has been estimated at approximately 62%, with severe periodontitis affecting 23.6% of the population. Compared to estimates from 1990 to 2010, these findings indicate a concerning trend in the rising prevalence of periodontal conditions [5].

Periodontal disease significantly impacts oral and dental health and quality of life, with its severity correlating to an increased adverse effect. Although therapeutic interventions can improve self-reported quality of life [6], several studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and systemic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, digestive diseases, respiratory diseases, and adverse pregnancy outcomes [7–11].

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of chronic and recurrent disorders that affect the gastrointestinal tract, with Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) representing the principal forms of the condition [12]. IBD is experiencing a global rise, marked by notable variations in prevalence and distinct disease trends across different countries and regions [13]. UC predominantly affects the colon and rectum, with inflammation confined to the mucosal layer [14]. In contrast, CD can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by inflammation that penetrates the full thickness of the intestinal wall [15]. IBD is associated with a variety of debilitating symptoms, including acute diarrhea, rectal bleeding, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue. These symptoms can significantly impact mental and social well-being, leading to extensive consequences for affected individuals [16]. Furthermore, the progression of IBD is typically chronic and may be linked to various systemic conditions that compromise both the physical and mental well-being of patients. This situation affects individuals directly and imposes a significant economic burden on patients and healthcare systems [17].

Periodontitis and IBD share several pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to their development and progression. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, influenced by genetic factors, immune system dysregulation, and environmental triggers [18–20]. Disruption of host-microbiome interactions likely plays an important role [19]. The association between periodontitis and IBD may be attributed to shared pathogenic mechanisms, such as the activation of Th17 cells driven byPorphyromonas gingivalisand systemic inflammation mediated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, the causal relationship between these conditions remains to be elucidated [21].

Several studies have indicated that individuals with IBD experience more severe and widespread periodontitis and oral lesions compared to those without IBD [22,23]. In contrast, a case-control study suggested that IBD does not correlate with the exacerbation of periodontal conditions. The findings of this research indicated that IBD does not inherently elevate the risk of developing periodontitis [24]. Another study found that inadequate oral hygiene exhibited an inverse correlation with IBD [25]. In this study, oral hygiene was assessed using the tooth loss index (the number of teeth evaluated in six selected teeth) and the dental plaque condition in patients with IBD and a control group. The authors found that losing 5 to 6 out of the 6 examined teeth was linked to a reduced risk of IBD. However, this research did not investigate periodontal inflammatory indices, e.g., pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, to identify the existence of gingivitis and periodontitis.

The existing data on the prevalence of periodontitis among patients with IBD is both limited and contentious. Currently, the association between periodontitis and IBD has not been conclusively proven. Clarifying this relationship is crucial, as it may inform future research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potentially guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Considering the aforementioned information and the contradictions in previous studies, we decided to conduct a comprehensive literature search, encompassing both established databases and one grey literature source.

The protocol for the present systematic review has been meticulously prepared and registered with the PROSPERO database under the registration code CRD42024572342. This protocol is accessible at the following link:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024572342.

The Population, Exposure, Comparison, and Outcome framework was employed to formulate the following focused research question: Human beings, regardless of sex, aged ≥ 18 (Population), diagnosis of IBD (including CD or UC), regardless of the type of IBD, treatment for IBD, or time of IBD diagnosis (Exposure), absence of IBD (Comparison), and periodontitis (Outcome).

This study conducted a comprehensive search across several databases, including PubMed (including title, abstract and medical subject headings [MeSH] terms), Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. Besides the first 100 articles obtained from Google Scholar, the reference lists of the selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further relevant literature. Notably, the search parameters were not restricted by publication date. The keywords used in the search included “inflammatory bowel disease,” (encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) as well as periodontitis and various related indices (see Appendix 1).

(1) This review involved case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies.

(2) The studies selected for this analysis have explored the association between periodontitis and IBD.

(3) Investigations that have assessed periodontal clinical parameters in individuals diagnosed with IBD compared to those without the condition.

(4) Furthermore, studies incorporating a control group for IBD were also considered for inclusion.

(1) Research that relied solely on questionnaires to evaluate periodontal health was excluded from this review.

(2) Studies in which participants in the case group presented with additional comorbidities alongside IBD were also omitted from consideration.

After collecting relevant articles, duplicates were eliminated, and the remaining studies were assessed based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This evaluation process was conducted independently by two reviewers (NN and FK), who analyzed the titles and abstracts of the articles to identify suitable candidates. In cases where consensus could not be reached regarding the selection or rejection of an article, a third team member was consulted for further guidance (MJT). The number of articles at each stage of the review process was documented in the PRISMA flowchart (Fig.1). Subsequently, all selected articles underwent a comprehensive critical review.

Data were extracted from the selected studies, including the following information: the name of the first author, year of publication, and country of study. Additionally, the study design, duration, total sample size, and the distribution of participants by disease type and gender were recorded. Furthermore, the subjects’ average age, smoking status, periodontal health status, and key findings reported in each study were noted.

The quality of the studies included in this analysis was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which ranges from 0 to 9 stars. This scale is a tool for assessing the risk of bias and the quality of the articles reviewed [26]. The NOS employs a star rating system, where higher scores reflect superior quality. Research studies that receive scores of 7 or above are typically regarded as high quality, whereas scores below 7 may indicate a greater likelihood of bias. Following a thorough evaluation, each article was assigned a maximum score of 9 stars. The assessment process encompassed nine criteria: selecting cases and controls, comparability, and outcomes. Based on the scores assigned to each study, the expert panel convened to make informed decisions regarding including or excluding individual articles from the analysis.

Data regarding IBD, including its two subtypes—CD and UC—and their association with periodontitis were systematically analyzed. All statistical analyses were performed through Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software (version 2.2.064; Biostat, 2011). The heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated using the I² index. Although the heterogeneity in the primary analysis was low (I² ~37.5%), a random-effects model was applied due to some genuine variability between studies. Begg and Mazumdar’s rank correlation test was conducted to evaluate publication bias, complemented by a funnel plot for visual inspection of asymmetry. A P-value of less than 0.05 from either Begg’s or Egger’s test indicated the presence of publication bias. Additionally, forest plots were used to present the estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The analysis was conducted utilizing crude OR.

The articles selected for inclusion were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, which provided a systematic framework for assessing their quality. The results indicated that all articles met moderate to high methodological quality criteria (Appendix 2, Tables1and2).

The studies encompassed a diverse range of populations, with most participants being middle-aged, as indicated by the mean age of the patient groups (Appendix 2, Table3). Various investigations addressed the smoking behaviors within these populations. However, a comparative analysis specifically contrasting patients with IBD against those without IBD while controlling for smoking habits could not be conducted. The periodontal indices assessed in the selected studies were systematically reviewed and analyzed. Notably, several studies reported a higher prevalence of periodontal pocket depth and clinical attachment loss in patients diagnosed with IBD compared to their non-IBD counterparts (Appendix 2, Table4).

IBD patients corticosteroids (n= 20), immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and methotrexate (n= 24), aminosalicylates (n= 39), anti-TNF therapies (n= 13), and antibiotics (n= 12), either as monotherapy or in combination.

patients with IBD were matched age, sex and smoking status.

A systematic analysis was conducted on studies exploring the relationship between IBD and periodontitis. The effect size was determined, and the heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated. The I² statistic was calculated at 37.53%; however, due to the variations in populations (with studies differing in geography, genetic backgrounds, lifestyles, etc.), a Random Effects model was employed. The OR for the risk of periodontitis in individuals with IBD compared to those without was calculated to be 2.28 (95% CI: 1.73–3; Z-value = 5.86). This suggests that individuals diagnosed with IBD are more than twice as likely to experience periodontitis compared to healthy controls (Appendix 3, Fig.2). Because there were only a few studies available, the Egger test was employed to assess publication bias, and no signs of bias were found (P= 0.64, see Appendix 3, Fig.3).

In the analysis of studies specifically examining CD and its association with periodontitis, a Random Effect model was used. This approach allowed for a thorough evaluation of effect size while addressing heterogeneity across the studies. The calculated OR for periodontitis among patients with CD relative to those without was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.4–2.83; Z-value = 3.84). This finding indicated a significant correlation between CD and an elevated risk of developing periodontitis (Appendix 3, Fig.4).

In examining studies investigating UC concerning periodontitis, a random Effect model was similarly applied. This methodology facilitated an accurate assessment of effect size while analyzing heterogeneity among the studies.

The OR for periodontitis in patients with UC compared to those without UC was determined to be 3.14 (95% CI: 2.11–4.66; Z-value = 5.69). This result indicates a significantly higher likelihood of periodontitis among individuals diagnosed with UC compared to healthy individuals (Fig.4). Ultimately, a subgroup analysis was conducted on studies examining the link between periodontitis and IBD using a Random Effects model, which involved dividing the control sample. While the OR for the UC group was greater than that for the CD group, the overlapping CIs and a P-value of 0.09 indicated no significant difference between UC and CD (see Appendix 3, Fig.4). Overall, the results from these analyses highlight a significant association between IBD, CD, and UC with an increased risk of periodontitis. The consistent findings across various studies underscore the necessity of monitoring oral health among patients diagnosed with these gastrointestinal disorders.

We conducted a sensitivity analysis by sequentially excluding each of the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis to assess the robustness of our pooled odds ratio (OR) for periodontitis development. The results demonstrated that the overall OR remained consistent regardless of which individual study was omitted. This consistency suggests that no single study disproportionately influenced the pooled effect size, and the small sample size did not introduce instability into the findings.

To date, systematic reviews have been performed to investigate the relationship between periodontal diseases and various health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, complications during pregnancy, and autoimmune disorders [27,28]. The most recent systematic review assessing the relationship between periodontitis and IBD utilized the same criteria as the present study but focused exclusively on articles published until October 2021 [29]. In the previously referenced study, the researchers discovered that patients with IBD exhibited significantly higher likelihood of developing periodontitis (OR = 2.65). Our recent analysis, which involved studies up to 2024, revealed an OR of 2.28, further supporting this positive correlation (with overlapping CIs).

Consequently, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of pertinent studies exploring the association between periodontitis and IBD, including CD and UC. Both periodontitis and IBD share an inflammatory etiology and are linked to microbial dysbiosis, as well as in certain instances modifications in the host immune response [30]. In total, a comprehensive review of the literature was conducted up to December 2024, including 10 articles for statistical analysis.

Our investigation revealed that patients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing periodontitis compared to individuals without IBD, with an OR of 2.28 (95% CI: 1.73-3). Furthermore, the OR for periodontitis was elevated among patients diagnosed with UC in comparison to those with CD, demonstrating an OR of 3.14 (95% CI: 2.11–4.66) for UC versus an OR of 1.99 (95% CI: 1.4–2.83) for CD. These findings demonstrate the relationship between any form of IBD and the prevalence of periodontitis. In this study, the OR for UC patients was found to be greater than that for CD patients. However, due to the overlapping CIs and a P-value of 0.09 from the formal subgroup difference test, no significant difference was observed between UC and CD. Although this difference was not statistically meaningful, future research into subtype-specific mechanisms such as differential Th1/Th17 polarization or oral-gut microbial translocation is needed.

Owing to stringent inclusion criteria and serious research limitations, not all studies identified for the systematic review were incorporated into the meta-analysis, as evidenced by the findings of the Zervou study [31]. The research involved a clinical examination of 15 patients with UC and 15 patients with CD to identify oral lesions and the prevalence of gingivitis and periodontitis. The results showed a higher incidence of periodontitis in CD patients compared to the control group (P= 0.01). However, since there were only two cases of periodontitis in the CD group and none in the control group, the calculated OR had a very wide CI (0.38-179.82), leading to its exclusion from the meta-analysis.

Our study aimed to determine the OR of periodontitis within a population diagnosed with IBD, necessitating the inclusion of only those studies that provided a definitive diagnosis of periodontitis. The meta-analysis encompassed 1,292 cases of IBD and 979 control subjects, revealing a significant increase in the risk of periodontitis among patients with IBD compared to the control group. Quantitative analyses revealed that eight of the studies included revealed a significant positive link between periodontitis and IBD [23,32–38]. For instance, a case-control study conducted by Grössner et al. in 2006 [24] found that probing pocket depth was significantly higher in the control group compared to IBD patients (P= 0.01). While IBD patients had a greater number of sites with clinical attachment loss of ≥ 4 mm and ≥ 5 mm compared to non-IBD patients, this difference was not statistically significant. In another study by Zervou et al. in 2004 [31], it was reported that the incidence of periodontitis was greater in individuals with CD than in the control group, although this trend was not observed in those with UC. Additionally, Majster et al. in 2024 [39] found no significant difference in the prevalence of periodontitis between IBD patients and the control group.

This systematic review included studies focused on participants aged 18 years and older. Additionally, only studies that offered a clear, clinical, and comprehensive definition of periodontitis were reviewed and analyzed. For instance, a study that employed the World Health Organization questionnaire to define periodontitis was excluded from this analysis [40]. While this exclusion may limit the applicability of the findings, the authors deemed it crucial to define periodontitis using clinical indices as the gold standard.

Previous systematic reviews have explored the association between periodontitis and IBD. Zhang et al. (2021) [41] conducted their investigation utilizing three databases—Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase—and incorporated studies that defined periodontitis through both clinical assessment and self-reporting. In contrast, our review undertook a comprehensive search across seven databases and employed rigorous clinical diagnostic criteria, thereby minimizing the risk of misclassification bias associated with self-reported information. Lorenzo-Pouso AI et al. (2021) [42] incorporated radiographic bone loss as a diagnostic criterion for periodontitis. While bone loss is a relevant marker, our study relied on clinical assessments to ensure diagnostic consistency across included studies. Ayati et al. (2025) [43] included self-reported periodontitis (Bertl et al.’s study [40], which used questionnaires rather than clinical examinations), whereas our analysis exclusively used clinical diagnostic criteria (the gold standard). They did not impose an age restriction (≥ 18 years), leading to the inclusion of pediatric populations (e.g., Koutsochristou et al.’s study [44]). Since periodontitis pathophysiology and IBD manifestations differ between children and adults, this may have introduced heterogeneity. Their review used the JBI checklist for quality assessment, which relies on yes/no/unclear responses, whereas our study employed the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), a more quantitative, star-based system extensively validated for observational studies.

In all studies reviewed, the presence of concomitant systemic diseases that could potentially impact the immune response of participants was established as an exclusion criterion. Consequently, the influence of other systemic conditions and diseases was effectively mitigated. Participants in the studies included in this systematic review were exclusively receiving medications pertinent to IBD. This uniformity in treatment regimens across the various studies ensured consistency in drug type and mechanism of action. The careful exclusion of confounding systemic conditions and the homogeneity of treatment protocols helped improve internal validity.

The current study is subject to several limitations. Firstly, there was a lack of consensus regarding the definition of periodontitis across some included studies, which could have introduced variability and potential bias in the results. Moreover, the accuracy of the reported data, including periodontal indices and the prevalence of periodontitis, may be compromised by measurement errors inherent in the methodologies employed. Besides the small sample sizes of the research studies included in this study, it is important to note that smoking is recognized as a significant risk factor for periodontitis. Individuals who smoke not only face an increased risk of developing periodontitis but are also more susceptible to IBD, such as CD. Furthermore, the presence of diversity within the studied populations, including variations in ethnic and geographic genetic backgrounds and differing dietary habits and lifestyles among participants across various studies, represents significant limitations and confounding factors in this research. Nearly all studies either failed to report confounding variables or had significant flaws, making meta-regression unfeasible.

It is important to highlight that all the studies included in this review were of observational type, which means that the review is not able to determine the direction of the relationship or causation. This leaves the question unresolved as to whether IBD contributes to worsening periodontal health, whether periodontitis may worsen IBD, or if other factors make individuals susceptible to both conditions. Additionally, confounding variables like diabetes, oral hygiene habits, and socioeconomic status were not considered in all studies. Moreover, some studies presented data that could not be statistically analyzed. The lack of sufficient data to assess smoking as a significant confounder in these studies prevented the possibility of conducting meta-regression. Although attempts were made to include merely comparable groups, there may still be uncontrolled differences between the IBD and non-IBD groups (such as access to healthcare or antibiotic usage) that could influence oral health. Furthermore, the small sample sizes of the included studies may not represent all patient subgroups, such as those with severe versus mild IBD or those undergoing different treatments. Most of the studies we included had small sample sizes that may introduce bias (e.g., overestimation or underestimation of the association), reduce statistical power, or limit generalizability. Although our sensitivity analysis suggested that no single study disproportionately influenced the pooled OR for periodontitis, the small sample size may still increase the risk of overestimation due to unpublished negative findings or heterogeneity among studies. Readers should interpret the effect size with caution until larger-scale meta-analyses confirm these results. This point underscores the need for larger, high-quality cohorts to improve estimate precision. Future researches are also recommended to focus on younger populations.

Several studies incorporated in this systematic review assessed periodontal indices alongside the prevalence of periodontitis. The analysis of these findings revealed an elevated risk of clinical attachment loss and probing pocket depth in individuals with IBD compared to those without the condition [23,32,33,35,37].

The oral cavity and intestines, as the terminal regions of the digestive system, exhibit comparable microbial pathogenic mechanisms. Disruptions in the intestinal microbial balance can lead to alterations in bacterial metabolites, releasing numerous pathogenic factors that may compromise host tissues and trigger an inflammatory response [45]. The human gut microbiota predominantly consists of Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with Firmicutes and Bacteroides being the most prevalent [46]. The host’s tissues create a nutrient-rich environment that supports the gut microbiota, contributing to the host’s health by producing short-chain fatty acids and essential vitamins, thereby maintaining a state of mutual symbiosis. However, in the context of IBD, alterations in the gut microbiota occur, a phenomenon referred to as “dysbiosis” [47].

According to Schmidt et al.’s research in 2019 [48], oral microorganisms are present in fecal samples, albeit at low concentrations. Oral microorganisms can migrate to the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating the colonization of pathogenic bacteria that disrupt intestinal homeostasis. This disruption may elicit an enhanced immune response from the host, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD [49]. Furthermore, the oral cavity may be a significant reservoir for enteric pathogens. For instance, the onset of periodontitis is associated with an increase in the populations of Klebsiella and Proteus within the oral cavity. These microorganisms can subsequently migrate to the lower gastrointestinal tract, where they might colonize inappropriately, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators in macrophages, potentially exacerbating intestinal inflammation [50].

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis)andFusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), recognized as pathogenic bacteria associated with periodontitis, can impact IBD’s progression. Research conducted by Lee et al. in 2022 [51] demonstrated a significant increase in the presence ofP. gingivalisin the feces of patients with CD. This intestinal colonization contributed to the deterioration of the intestinal surface epithelium, disruption of crypt architecture, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, thereby exacerbating the inflammatory symptoms within the gastrointestinal tract. Strauss et al. [52] identified the presence ofF. nucleatumin the intestinal mucosa of patients with IBD. Their findings indicate a positive correlation between the invasive potential of variousF. nucleatumstrains and the severity of the host’s disease status, suggesting thatF. nucleatummay serve as a valuable biomarker for gastrointestinal disorders. Beyond the presence of microbes, their metabolites can traverse the gut-mouth axis, contributing to heightened intestinal inflammation [19].

Furthermore, systemic inflammation in individuals with IBD has been shown to influence oral microbiota composition. Research conducted by Docktor et al. [53] revealed an increase in the abundance of Spirochetes and Bacteroides, alongside a reduction in Firmicutes and Fusobacteria, within the oral cavity of patients diagnosed with IBD. Said et al. [54] conducted a study utilizing bacterial 16 S rRNA sequencing and identified a notable increase in the abundance ofPrevotella spp. within the salivary microbiota of individuals diagnosed with IBD. In contrast, the study also revealed a significant reduction in the prevalence ofStreptococcusspecies, typically the most abundant genera found in the saliva of healthy individuals.

While our meta-analysis affirms an epidemiological link between periodontitis and IBD, the association may be attributed to overlapping inflammatory pathways and dysbiosis-driven immune responses. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, which is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, alongside the aberrant activation of immune cells, including Th17 cells. These factors contribute to tissue damage in both the gastrointestinal and periodontal systems. Moreover, microbial dysbiosis is pivotal in the pathogenesis of IBD, as an altered gut microbiome exacerbates intestinal inflammation. In the case of periodontitis, pathogenic oral bacteria, likeP. gingivalis, are key players in the disruption of periodontal integrity. Microbial communities in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract may engage in systemic interactions, where translocation of oral pathogens to the gut can worsen the severity of IBD. Conversely, inflammation in the gut may enhance periodontal inflammation through the release of circulating inflammatory mediators. Genetic susceptibility such as caspase activating recruitment domain 15/nucleotide oligomerisation domain 2 (CARD15/NOD2) mutations and environmental risk factors like smoking further link the two conditions, suggesting a bidirectional relationship fueled by shared immunopathological mechanisms [55–57].

Another investigation demonstrated that IBD significantly alters bacterial colonization within the oral cavity of affected patients. Notably, the degree of this disruption correlates with the severity of the disease. Furthermore, it was observed that these microbial imbalances tend to resolve gradually following the effective treatment of IBD [58]. Since the current study solely focused on observational research, it is still unclear if treatments for IBDs positively impact the periodontal health of affected patients. Therefore, it is suggested that additional clinical trials and systematic reviews be conducted, with an emphasis on controlling for confounding variables.

Host immune factors play a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and IBD. Immune cells and inflammatory cytokines can disseminate from localized sites through the bloodstream, potentially leading to inflammatory responses in distant organs. The expression levels of cytokines serve as valuable biomarkers for evaluating the clinical status of patients suffering from periodontitis and IBD. Notably, the IL-17/IL-23 signaling pathway is instrumental in both conditions, as it modulates the innate immune response to various tissues and pathogens [30,59].

Despite the complexities inherent in both IBD and periodontitis, additional research is essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of IBD and to refine its treatment strategies. A significant number of patients with IBD may not fully recognize the implications of their condition about the onset and progression of periodontal disease. Consequently, physicians, as integral healthcare team members, have a pivotal role in educating patients about these connections and facilitating referrals for regular periodontal assessments and care as part of IBD management. During clinical follow-ups, patients should be advised to undergo comprehensive periodontal screenings at least annually, adopt preventive oral hygiene practices and seek prompt treatment for gingival inflammation to reduce systemic inflammatory burden.

Future research should address current limitations, including heterogeneity in periodontitis definitions (e.g., standardization via the 2017 World Workshop criteria) and confounding factors (smoking, diabetes, and medication effects). Large-scale, longitudinal studies with adjusted confounders are needed to establish causality and elucidate underlying mechanisms, such as the role of oral-gut microbial translocation or shared immunogenetic pathways. Additionally, interventional studies assessing the impact of periodontal therapy on IBD activity could inform clinical guidelines and improve patient outcomes.

The chance of developing periodontitis is elevated in individuals with IBD compared to healthy counterparts. A comprehensive multidisciplinary approach is essential for the effective management of IBD, and it is imperative that dental professionals be integrated into the multidisciplinary team responsible for the care of patients with IBD. Given the nature of the articles included in this study, we are unable to establish causation or the direction of the effect based on this analysis. Additionally, conducting more high-quality research, particularly prospective cohort or interventional studies aimed at enhancing periodontal health in IBD patients, would be beneficial in elucidating this relationship.
