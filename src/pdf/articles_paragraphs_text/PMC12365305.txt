This study introduces a novel machine learning algorithm that combines natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, with neural networks to identify and validate significant actions within human action sequences. Using the 2012 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies dataset, the algorithm visualizes and analyzes action sequences in a 2D vector space to uncover high-impact behaviors that influence performance. The methodology, validated across two problem sets (“Party Invitation” and “Club Membership”), successfully distinguishes performance groups by focusing on critical actions, leading to enhanced classification accuracy (up to 94.6%) and clustering coherence (silhouette score of 0.491). This approach demonstrates potential applications in personalized education, healthcare diagnostics, and consumer behavior prediction, advancing the understanding of human behavior through digital footprints.

Understanding human behavior through digital interactions has become increasingly critical across various fields, including education, healthcare, and marketing. As human interactions continue to migrate to digital platforms, the ability to analyze and interpret behavioral patterns has transitioned from theoretical exploration to practical application, enabled by large-scale datasets. Action sequences, representing series of user interactions, provide a unique lens through which decision-making and performance can be examined.

The availability of vast digital interaction data allows researchers to uncover nuanced patterns and relationships that were previously inaccessible. For instance, analyzing sequences of actions performed during problem-solving tasks can reveal significant insights into cognitive strategies, decision-making processes, and behavioral tendencies. This information has profound implications for improving outcomes in domains such as personalized education1–5, early medical diagnostics6–12, and customer behavior prediction13–22.

Traditional analytical methods, such as adjacent action analysis or n-grams23–25, often fall short of capturing the complexity of non-linear and non-consecutive relationships within sequences. These limitations hinder the ability to uncover deeper behavioral insights necessary for accurate predictions and meaningful interventions. Additionally, conventional methods struggle to integrate diverse and dynamic datasets, further limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Recent research has applied natural language processing (NLP) and vectorization techniques to improve the representation and interpretation of log data. For example, Xiao et al. (2024) proposed a vectorization-based framework for system log parsing that enables deeper pattern discovery35. Similarly, Kampik et al. (2023) demonstrated the utility of NLP for extracting semantic insights from business process logs, while Ramos-Gutiérrez et al. (2021) emphasized improving log quality through linguistic analysis for more robust downstream inference37. These works highlight the expanding role of NLP in understanding behavioral patterns from event logs.

This study addresses these gaps by introducing a novel algorithm that leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, combined with neural networks26,27and random forest28. Neural network is a recently popular machine learning algorithm, and random forest is a traditional algorithm. Neural networks are powerful machine learning tools designed to classify data by identifying complex patterns. Modeled after the structure of the human brain, they consist of layers of interconnected nodes that learn from data through training. In this study, neural networks were employed for classification, utilizing their capacity to model non-linear relationships and adapt to various input features. We apply the two algorithms to see how consistently the results are derived. The proposed approach identifies meaningful actions within sequences that significantly impact outcomes, enabling better understanding and prediction of human behavior26,29. By embedding actions into high-dimensional vector spaces, the algorithm captures contextual relationships between actions, facilitating the discovery of critical behaviors that influence performance27,30.

Using the 2012 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) dataset31, this study validates its methodology on two distinct problem sets—“Party Invitation” and "Club Membership." These problem sets provide diverse contexts for testing the algorithm’s robustness and effectiveness. The findings demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to uncover high-impact actions that distinguish high-performing individuals from their peers. These insights have practical applications across disciplines, including developing adaptive feedback systems in education, predictive models in healthcare, and behavioral analytics in marketing.

Overall, this research highlights the transformative potential of action sequence analysis in advancing our understanding of human behavior. By addressing existing methodological limitations and leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques, this study paves the way for innovative applications that bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical interventions.

The study used the 2012 PIAAC dataset, focusing on two problem sets: “Party Invitation” and "Club Membership." The “Party Invitation” dataset involved 1394 participants who performed 35 distinct actions, while the “Club Membership” dataset included 1345 participants carrying out 25 distinct actions. In the “Party Invitation”, participants performed actions sequentially to solve the problem, selecting from the 35 available actions. Similarly, in the “Club Membership” task, participants performed actions in sequence from the 25 actions. The total number of actions ranged from 10 to 348 (with a median of 31) for the “Party Invitation” task, and from 10 to 253 (with a median of 48) for the “Club Membership” task. Figure1Histogram of the number of actions of `Party Invitation’ and `Club Membership’ problem sets across participants shows the distribution of the total number of actions across participates for both tasks. The participant age and gender details are provided in Table1. The age groups in the 10 s and 60 s and above are slightly smaller, but the remaining age groups are fairly evenly distributed. The dataset is also balanced in terms of gender. Participant scores are categorized into performance levels in Tables2and3, which form the basis for identifying high-impact actions. Tables4and5provide examples of action sequences for the score0 and score3 groups, as well as for the correct and incorrect groups.

To ensure consistency and reliability, the dataset was preprocessed to remove incomplete logs or sequences with missing actions. The preprocessed data were then stratified by performance levels to facilitate comparisons between high- and low-performing groups. These problem sets provided diverse contexts for evaluating the methodology’s robustness and generalizability across different types of tasks.

The feature selection process aimed to convert raw action sequences into meaningful vector representations that capture contextual relationships. Word2Vec, with a vector size of 100 and a window size of 5, was used to embed individual actions into high-dimensional vector spaces, utilizing the skip-gram model to learn contextual relationships from co-occurrence patterns26,29. This approach allowed for the identification of both adjacent and non-adjacent relationships, addressing limitations of traditional n-grams24. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA and t-SNE, were applied to these embeddings to visualize clusters and patterns associated with different performance levels32,33.

To represent entire sequences holistically, Doc2Vec was employed, specifically the Distributed Bag-of-Words (PV-DBOW) architecture26,30. This approach facilitated sequence-level comparisons by embedding sequences based on their constituent actions, enabling deeper insights into group-level differences. Hyperparameters, including vector sizes and training epochs, were optimized to enhance embedding quality, like a vector size of 100, a window size of 5, training epochs of 100, ensuring robust feature selection across diverse contexts27.

To validate the significance of identified actions, a structured verification process was conducted using three distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, original sequences containing all actions were analyzed as a baseline. The second scenario focused exclusively on sequences comprising only the identified meaningful actions, which were determined through clustering and visualization30,33. In the third scenario, sequences were modified to exclude these meaningful actions, allowing for an assessment of their absence on clustering coherence and classification accuracy.

The validation process involved calculating silhouette scores to measure the quality of clustering within the embedded vector space32. Higher silhouette scores indicated better-defined clusters, signifying clearer distinctions between high- and low-performing groups27. Additionally, sequence embeddings were visualized to qualitatively assess spatial separation between clusters, further corroborating the quantitative findings33. We also applied Neural Network and Random Forest for group classification, and verified how well the group classification was performed depending on the presence or absence of the features suggested in feature selection. Figure2shows the process of the feature selection and feature verification.

How to identify meaningful actions from sequences of actions in two steps: feature selection and feature verification.

The feature selection and verification processes have been conducted with the two problem sets, ‘Party Invitation’ and ‘Club Membership’ from the PIAAC problem-solving test.

‘Party Invitation’ is a problem-solving set in which the task is to place emails into folders according to their pars. This task requires reading comprehension and familiarity with the working environment.

Vectorized actions of the participants of the score 0 group and the score 3 group are presented in Figs.3,4, respectively. We concentrated on the score 0 and score 3 groups to better highlight the differences in action sequences between the two groups, where the variations in the vector space are most significant. To compare the two groups, the vector space for the score 0 group was divided into three clusters. Cluster 1, comprising three mail-moving actions (MAIL_DROP, MAIL_MOVED, and MAIL_DRAG), exhibits a notable difference: the mail-moving actions are positioned far apart from other actions in the score 0 vector space, unlike the score 3 vector space. Cluster 2 reveals differences in both the component actions and the structure of actions. In the score 0 group’s vector space, Cluster 2 is tightly grouped without any sub-clusters, while in the score 3 group’s vector space, it is more dispersed with potential sub-clusters. Additionally, mail-moving actions are positioned with other actions in the score 3 group’s vector space, unlike the score 0 group. Lastly, Cluster 3 in both group’s vector spaces does not show significant differences, as they form clusters themselves in both cases.

The mail-moving actions, as highlighted in Fig.4, which exhibit the most significant differences between the score 0 and 3 groups, were selected as potentially meaningful actions to distinguish these groups. One example of action sequences from score 3 group is like [START, MAIL_DRAG, MAIL_VIEWED, FOLDER_VIEWED, MAIL_DROP, MAIL_MOVED, MAIL_DRAG, FOLDER_VIEWED, MAIL_DROP, MAIL_MOVED, MAIL_VIEWED, MAIL_VIEWED, MAIL_VIEWED, MAIL_DRAG, MAIL_VIEWED, FOLDER_VIEWED, MAIL_DROP, MAIL_MOVED, MAIL_VIEWED, MAIL_VIEWED, NEXT_INQUIRY, NEXT_BUTTON, CONFIRMATION_OPENED, BUTTON, DOACTION, BUTTON, CONFIRMATION_CLOSED, NEXT_ITEM] which shows the position of the potential meaningful actions and their varying context actions.

Consequently, we used the mail-moving actions to create three distinct case studies to assess the significance of mail-moving actions in distinguishing between the score 0 and 3 groups: original sequences (case1), subsequences consisting only of mail-moving actions (case2), and subsequences consisting of actions without mail-moving actions (case3). Each case, except for case 1, involves subsequences. Doc2Vec is then used to generate vectors from these subsequences. Silhouette score for each case study is presented in Table6. Visualization of sequences of actions by Doc2Vec is presented in Fig.5. In Fig.5, purple dots indicate sequences by participants in the score 0 group and yellow dots indicate sequences by participants in the score 3 group. In Case 1, which encompasses all 35 actions, the degree of separation, as evidenced by a silhouette score of 0.36, can be visually observed in Fig.5a. Case 2, focusing solely on mail-moving actions, demonstrates an enhanced degree of separation, reflected in a silhouette score of 0.491, as presented in Fig.5b. Case 3, which excludes mail-moving actions, exhibits a lower degree of separation between the two groups compared to Case 1 and Case 2, indicated by a reduced silhouette score of 0.216 (see Fig.5c).

Although the silhouette score may appear relatively low, this can be reasonably attributed to two key factors: distortions introduced by dimensionality reduction techniques and variations in intra-cluster density. In particular, dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE or PCA—commonly used for visualization—often distort the original high-dimensional distance relationships, leading to discrepancies between visual interpretation and quantitative clustering metrics. Additionally, intra-cluster density variation refers to the phenomenon where some clusters are tightly packed while others are more dispersed. This heterogeneity increases the average intra-cluster distance, thereby reducing the silhouette score, even if the clusters are visually well-separated.

Moreover, due to the inherently noisy and overlapping nature of behavioral log data, it is challenging to obtain ideally high silhouette scores in unsupervised clustering settings. Nevertheless, among the three experimental cases, Case 2 clearly exhibits the most distinct cluster separation in the 2D projection, and from a relative performance perspective, it demonstrates the most coherent and interpretable clustering structure. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the validity of the clustering configuration employed in Case 2.

The neural network (NN) results using Doc2Vec vectors as input are displayed in Table7, showing the prediction efficiencies ranging from 0.850 to 0.962 for both F1 and accuracy. Consistent with the Doc2Vec visualization results and silhouette scores, Case 2, which exhibit better separation than Case 1, demonstrate higher prediction efficiencies compared to Case 1. Conversely, the prediction efficiency of Case 3 is the lowest, falling below 0.9 for both F1 and accuracy. The random forest (RF) results were derived not much different from the NN results.

In the “Party Invitation” problem set, mail-moving actions were pivotal for organizing emails into folders, with participants scoring 3 executing all such actions, while those scoring 0 performed few or none. Analysis revealed differences in the frequency, sequence placement, and contextual relationships of these actions, reflecting disparities in participants’ skills and strategies. Using Word2Vec, mail-moving actions in the score 3 group showed strong contextual coherence with 10 adjacent actions, forming tight clusters, whereas the score 0 group exhibited dispersed patterns. Feature verification reinforced the importance of mail-moving actions, with Case 2 (focusing solely on these actions) achieving the highest silhouette score (0.491) and classification accuracy (94.6%), while Case 3 (excluding these actions) showed reduced performance. These findings highlight the capability of Word2Vec to capture non-consecutive relationships and the critical role of mail-moving actions in distinguishing performance levels, contributing to improved data coherence and predictive accuracy.

In the ‘Club Membership’ problem set, participants are tasked with finding a membership ID number for a given name and emailing it. This task evaluates their familiarity with both a lookup system and a mailing system.

The vectorized actions of the correct group and the incorrect group are presented in Figs.6,7, respectively. As in ‘Party Invitation’ problem set, the vector space for incorrect group is divided into 3 clusters for comparison. The cluster 1 displays notable difference between the correct group and the incorrect group, in terms of the sorting actions (SS_SORT, COMBOBOX, RADIO_BTN), the mail-sending actions (TEXTBOX_KILLFOCUS and TEXTBOX_ONFOCUS), and environment actions (ENVIRONMENT and TOOLBAR). In the incorrect group, cluster 1 exists, whereas in the correct group, sorting actions form their cluster, and mail-sending actions, along with environment actions (cluster 2 actions), form distinct clusters. The cluster 3 doesn’t show discernible differences in two vector spaces as it forms its own cluster in both cases.

Sorting actions were excluded from consideration for feature verification as they were infrequent in both groups, occurring only 204 times out of 934 in the correct group and 18 times out of 410 in the incorrect group. It was deemed inadequate to utilize sorting actions to compare the correct and incorrect groups due to their infrequency. Consequently, cluster 2 actions, which include mail-sending actions and environment actions highlighted in Fig.7, were chosen as potential meaningful actions to differentiate between the correct and incorrect groups One example of action sequences from correct group is like [START, TOOLBAR, ENVIRONMENT, DOACTION, DOACTION, DOACTION, DOACTION, TOOLBAR, ENVIRONMENT, DOACTION, DOACTION, DOACTION, DOACTION, TEXTBOX_ONFOCUS, KEYPRESS, KEYPRESS, KEYPRESS, KEYPRESS, TEXTBOX_KILLFOCUS, NEXT_INQUIRY, NEXT_BUTTON, CONFIRMATION_OPENED, BUTTON, DOACTION, TEXTBOX_ONFOCUS, TEXTBOX_KILLFOCUS, BUTTON, CONFIRMATION_CLOSED, NEXT_ITEM, END] which shows the position of the potential meaningful actions and their varying context actions.

Similar to the ‘Party Invitation’ problem set, three cases were created, and each case involved subsequence generation, except for case 1. Case 1 encompasses all 25 actions; case 2 focuses exclusively on mail-sending actions, and case 3 involves all 21 actions, excluding mail-sending actions. Silhouette score for each case study is presented in Table8. Visualization of sequences of actions by Doc2Vec is presented in Fig.8. In Fig.8, purple dots indicate sequences by participants in the correct group and yellow dots indicate sequences by participants in the incorrect group. Notably, the differences between the two groups became more pronounced in case 2 with the higher silhouette score compared to case 1 as shown in Fig.8a and b. In contrast, the absence of mail-sending actions in sequences in case 3 led to a decrease in the degree of separation between the two groups, as evidenced by a silhouette score of 0.129 and visualized in Fig.8c.

Even in this case, the silhouette score value is not that high. However, as described in the previous ‘Party Invitation’ problem, it may be a limitation due to the intrinsic characteristics of the data and the intra-cluster density variation. In particular, as shown in the two-dimensional figure, the intra-cluster density variation is large. Nevertheless, a notable point in the silhouette scores is that among the scores of the three cases of the experiment, the score of case 2 tends to be considerably higher than that of the other two cases. This suggests that the action sequences we detected are sufficiently meaningful compared to other action sequences.

In all three cases, NN efficiency, F1, and accuracy range from 0.862 to 0.917 in Table9. Notably, when exclusively considering the mail-sending and environment actions in case 2, the efficiency is as good as the one of case 1 with a maximum F1 score of 0.917 and an accuracy of 0.876. Case 3, which omits the meaningful actions in sequences, exhibits a slightly reduced F1 score and accuracy. As with the party invitation problem, the RF results show very similar consistency with the NN results.

In the “Club Membership” problem set, mail-sending actions were critical for task completion, as participants needed to email membership information. Correct group participants consistently executed these actions at the end of sequences, aligning with task requirements, while the incorrect group performed them less frequently and at inconsistent points in sequences. Analysis using Word2Vec revealed that correct group participants demonstrated stronger contextual relationships between mail-sending and adjacent actions, forming cohesive clusters. Feature verification further highlighted the significance of these actions, with Case 2 (focusing on meaningful actions) achieving superior silhouette scores and NN prediction efficiency compared to Case 1 (all actions) and Case 3 (excluding meaningful actions). Although the improvement was less pronounced than in the “Party Invitation” set, focusing on four key actions achieved comparable prediction accuracy, underscoring their importance. These findings suggest that the trained NN model can generalize to new datasets, enabling score predictions and comparisons across various features like completion time.

This study introduced a novel algorithm leveraging NLP techniques, specifically Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, to identify and validate meaningful actions in action sequences using the 2012 PIAAC dataset. These NLP methods enabled the vectorization of individual actions and sequences, facilitating visual inspections to uncover key action sequences. The algorithm was tested on two problem sets, successfully identifying meaningful actions through the visual examination of word vectors in a 2D space.

A significant advantage of employing Word2Vec is its ability to uncover action relationships independently of their relative positioning, which is challenging for conventional methods like n-grams. The proposed algorithm demonstrated the effectiveness of combining action sequence vectorization with neural networks for binary classification, as evidenced by improved prediction accuracy and clustering coherence. Silhouette scores confirmed the spatial differentiation between high-score and low-score groups, reinforcing the robustness of the identified meaningful actions.

In both problem sets, our methodology successfully identified actions critical to participant performance. For the “Party Invitation” problem, three key actions were identified among 35 behaviors, distinguishing participants scoring 0 and 3. Similarly, in the “Club Membership” problem, four key actions were identified among 25 behaviors, effectively differentiating correct and incorrect groups. These findings suggest that individuals who do not perform these critical actions well are significantly more likely to achieve lower scores.

The findings of this study demonstrate substantial implications across various fields, showcasing the versatility of the proposed methodology. In education, the algorithm enables the development of adaptive feedback systems that guide individuals by identifying critical actions they fail to perform, thereby improving learning outcomes. In healthcare, the approach provides a framework for detecting behavioral patterns linked to conditions such as depression or dementia, offering potential for early intervention and personalized treatment plans. Similarly, in marketing, the algorithm can analyze clickstream data to predict consumer purchasing intentions, optimizing customer targeting and enhancing campaign effectiveness. These applications underline the broader utility of action sequence analysis, providing a pathway for translating behavioral data into actionable insights across disciplines.

Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications, even when executed on moderately resourced hardware. In practice, each experiment was completed within half a day, and with optimized data handling, we anticipate scalability to datasets involving tens or even hundreds of thousands of sequences. This efficiency supports the applicability of our approach to large-scale behavioral data analysis across various domains.

Despite its strengths, this study has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. The analysis relies on the Belgian PIAAC dataset, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other cultural or demographic contexts. Additionally, the sequences analyzed were relatively short and structured, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world behaviors. Temporal dynamics, such as transitions between actions, were not explicitly modeled, potentially overlooking critical sequential patterns. Furthermore, the computational cost associated with vectorization and clustering processes raises concerns about scalability when applying the algorithm to larger datasets or real-time applications. Addressing these limitations is essential for broader adoption and improved robustness of the methodology.

One important limitation of this study is the potential bias in action sequence patterns arising from demographic differences among participants. While prior research has shown that factors such as age, gender, and digital familiarity can influence interaction behaviors e.g.34, our analysis could not incorporate subgroup-specific comparisons due to insufficient demographic labeling in the available dataset. Future studies should incorporate fairness-aware modeling approaches to assess whether the algorithm performs equitably across diverse user populations and mitigate any unintended bias.

To overcome these limitations and enhance the applicability of the proposed approach, future research should focus on several key areas. First, the algorithm should be validated using datasets from diverse cultural and demographic backgrounds to ensure robustness and generalizability. In particular, subgroup analyses based on age, gender, and digital literacy could help identify whether certain demographic groups exhibit distinct behavioral patterns, thereby improving the fairness and interpretability of the model. Second, predictive modeling using advanced temporal architectures—such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer-based models—should be explored to capture long-range dependencies and improve outcome prediction based on action sequences. These architectures may also provide greater expressiveness in modeling complex behavioral transitions over time. Third, the methodology should be extended to analyze unstructured or longer action sequences, which are more representative of real-world scenarios. Additionally, improving computational efficiency through algorithmic optimization will address scalability concerns, enabling applications to larger datasets and real-time settings. Finally, integrating multimodal data such as text inputs, physiological signals, action lengths, and timestamps per action enriches analytics and expands the scope of behavioral insights, opening the way to innovative applications in human behavior modeling and predictive models.

This study makes a significant contribution to the field of human behavior analysis by introducing a novel NLP-driven methodology that captures the complexity of action sequences. By uncovering meaningful actions, the proposed algorithm enhances prediction accuracy and provides actionable insights across diverse domains. Through continued refinement and expansion of this approach, future research can unlock further potential in understanding and influencing human behavior, enabling innovative solutions in education, healthcare, and beyond.
