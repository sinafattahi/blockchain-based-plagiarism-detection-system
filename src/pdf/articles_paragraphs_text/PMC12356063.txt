The development of
intelligent 3D printing materials with photo-
and thermally responsive properties remains a challenge, particularly
for sustainable applications requiring reprocessability, multifunctionality,
and precise control over dynamic behaviors. Herein, we report a solvent-free
photoprintable ink featuring dual dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs), designed
for photo- and thermally responsive 3D printing. The resin combines
dynamic disulfides and β-hydroxy esters, further enhanced with
photoswitchable spiropyran additives, enabling tunable photochromic
and thermochromic properties. This material also exhibits shape memory
functionality, allowing simultaneous shape and color transitions under
heat. Printed prototypes demonstrate exceptional thermal stability
and multifunctionality, supporting applications in anticounterfeiting,
imaging, and sensing. These results provide a sustainable and innovative
solution for intelligent 3D printing materials, bridging the gap between
multifunctionality and reprocessability. By advancing the capabilities
of responsive materials, this work paves the way for transformative
progress in adaptive manufacturing and practical applications in next-generation
functional devices.

To overcome the existing issues with SLA printing materials,
incorporating
dynamic covalent chemistry into the chemical composition provides
feasible pathways for developing closed-loop recyclable inks, printed elastomers with variable mechanical properties, robust prints with ductile properties at elevated
temperature, and shape-programmable processes.
Traditional covalent networks are typically static and stable, making
it difficult to break and reform. In contrast, dynamic covalent networks
(DCNs), composed of cross-linked polymer structures in dynamic equilibrium
via reversible covalent bonds, combine the high mechanical and thermal
resistance of thermosets with the reshaping, reprocessing, shape reconfiguration,
and memory capabilities of thermoplastics through reversible bond
exchange. The polymer network’s
topology is the key determinant of its shape memory and reprogramming
abilities. Upon heating, the increased mobility of polymer chains
allows for rearrangement under applied stress, enabling shape reconfiguration.
Upon cooling, the stabilized network locks in the new shape. Moreover,
the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) enables reversible
bond breakage and reformation at elevated temperatures, facilitating
the reorganization of the polymer network’s topology. This
dynamic cross-linking process allows the material’s internal
structure to adjust under thermal stimuli. By employing these reversible
bonds in UV-curable inks, shape-adaptive and thermally adaptable printable
prototypes can be developed. The commonly used reversible chemistries
include, disulfide bonds, transesterification
reactions, Diels–Alder reactions, imines, carbamate, hindered urea, and
boronate esters. In this work, the combination
of disulfide bond exchange and β-hydroxy ester transformations,
facilitated by a transesterification catalyst, allows for enhanced
control over polymer chain rearrangement and topological reorganization
at elevated temperatures. The use of
these two chemistries provides complementary mechanisms: disulfide
bond exchange offers rapid reversibility, while β-hydroxy ester
transformations enable more gradual, tunable rearrangement, together
improving the adaptability of the material’s structure. This capacity is essential for facilitating
self-healing, shape reconfiguration, and memory effects. These properties
are critical for developing materials with shape memory and configurability,
making them highly valuable for additive manufacturing.

In addition to incorporating dynamic building
blocks or other versatile
moieties into the polymeric network to enhance the fundamental physicochemical
properties of printing materials, recent advancements in ink technology
have driven significant interest in the development of multifunctional
printing components. By simply mixing additives with ink, prints can
be readily tailored to meet a wide range of functional requirements.
Inks containing multifunctional additives demonstrate improved properties
and functionalities, such as enhanced mechanical strength, thermal stability, electrical conductivity, and superior
chemical, optical, and biological characteristics,
thereby accelerating the advancement of the 3D printing field.

Molecular switches, which can reversibly change molecular conformation
and color in response to external stimuli such as light, pH, and temperature,
represent an exciting development in functional inks. These functional
inks expand the range of applications and lead to the development
of innovative printed parts with superior performance characteristics.
The unique properties of photochromic and thermochromic inks make
them highly versatile and appealing for various functions, including
apparel, textiles, fluorescence imaging, smart lenses, security printing, packaging, indicators, hazard warnings, and smart windows for energy-efficient buildings.,Among the molecular switches, spiropyrans are one of the earliest
reported organic photochromic systems, yet highly interesting due
to their multiresponsive behavior to light, heat, and pH. Spiropyrans
are colorless, but UV excitation causes a ring-opening reaction associated
with the breakage of the C–O bond, which transforms the molecule
into its conjugated merocyanine (MC) form, that absorbs visible light
(500–600 nm) and, hence, appears colored.

Finally, traditional inks, which rely on solvent-based
formulations,
release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous chemicals
during production and postprocessing, contributing to environmental
impacts and health risks. This underscores
the need for more sustainable alternatives. The development of environmentally
friendly printing inks is essential for aligning industrial practices
with sustainability goals.

In this
work, we address critical limitations in materials for
mSLA 3D printing by developing an affordable photoprintable ink that
incorporates dual dynamic covalent bonds (disulfides and β-hydroxy
esters) via a straightforward, solvent-free process. The cross-linker
(DPBMA) was synthesized to introduce dual dynamic disulfides and β-hydroxy
esters into its main chain. Successful synthesis was achieved through
a straightforward preparation method, where glycidyl methacrylate
(GMA) was esterified with 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid at a
2:1 molar ratio at 100 °C, using triazabicyclodecene (TBD) as
a transesterification catalyst (Figurea). Its chemical structure was confirmed with ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy (Figure S2) and1H NMR (Figure S3). The appearance of absorbance
at 3460 and 1636 cm–1, along with the absence of
intensity at 1689 and 910 cm–1, indicates the successful
grafting of methacrylate while maintaining the unsaturated moiety
(Figure S2). Additionally, the protons
at 6.0 and 5.7 ppm and the signals from the f, h, and g positions
further support this finding (Figure S3). For the photoprinting (Figureb), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA, 20% w/w), a
monofunctional diluent, was mixed with DPBMA (80% w/w) and a photoinitiator
(BAPO, 0.5% w/w). Spiropyran molecular switches capable of photochromic
responses (SP1, reddening upon exposure to 365 nm UV lightand, and
SP2, yellowing upon 50 °C or above) were mixed into the liquid
photosensitive resin, resulting in a SP1 containing resin and a SP2
containing resin, to investigate its responsive behavior (Figurec). This innovative
approach minimizes the need for extensive postprocessing while enhancing
mechanical strength and durability, effectively overcoming challenges
related to material fragility and enabling tunable shape adjustments.
Moreover, the dual dynamic bonds confer reusability and reprocessability,
directly addressing environmental concerns such as waste and pollution
associated with conventional thermoset materials. By integrating two
spiropyran additives with distinct photochromic behaviors, we developed
self-healable resins capable of color switching upon irradiation or
heating/cooling stimuli. For instance, a printed flower demonstrates
a dual-response mechanism: it opens and transitions from colorless
to yellow under heat, showcasing the potential for developing and
enriching interactive 4D printing materials. Furthermore, our strategy
offers a rapid stress-relaxation polymer network, solving problems
related to high consumable costs and offering a sustainable, cost-effective
alternative. These advancements collectively demonstrate a substantial
improvement in the material properties for mSLA printing, unlocking
new opportunities for versatile, environmentally friendly, and high-performance
applications.

2-Hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA, 99%, containing
≤ 50 ppm monomethyl ether hydroquinone as an inhibitor), 2-propanol
(99.5%), and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 ((CD3)2SO, 99.5
atom % D) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Phenylbis­(2,4,6-trimethyl
benzoyl) phosphine oxide (BAPO, 97%), glycidyl methacrylate (>95%,
stabilized with MEHQ), and 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid (>99.0%)
were purchased from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Japan). Triazabicyclodecene
(TBD, 97%), 2-(3′,3′-dimethyl-6-nitrospiro­[chromene-2,2′-indolin]-1′-yl)­ethanol
(SP1, 93%) were acquired from BLD Pharmatech GmbH. All chemicals were
used as received. Merocyanine photoacid (SP2) molecules were prepared
according to a reported procedure.,The1H NMR spectrum corresponding to the chemical structure is presented
inFigure S1.

(3,3′-Disulfanediylbis­(propanoyl))­bis­(oxy)­bis­(2-hydroxypropane-3,1-diyl)
bis­(2-methyl acrylate) (DPBMA) was synthesized through straightforward
polymerization as follows. First, glycidyl methacrylate (28.4 g, 190
mmol), 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid (20.2 g, 95 mmol), and TBD
(0.5% w/w, 0.243 g) were added to a conical flask. The mixture was
stirred using a magnetic stirrer at a speed of 200 rpm, while the
heating plate was set to 100 °C. Throughout the process, the
mixture was carefully observed as it transitioned from phase separation
to a milky white state and eventually became transparent. Once the
mixture reached a transparent state, heating was maintained for an
additional 10 min and then turning off the heater. While the reaction
mixture was still warm and relatively fluid, the magnetic stir bar
was removed. Finally, after cooling, a colorless and transparent viscous
substance was obtained. The product’s chemical structure was
determined through1H NMR and ATR-FTIR analyses.

HEMA and DPBMA were
mixed at a weight ratio of 1:4 and stirred magnetically at 100 rpm
until a uniform mixture was obtained. Subsequently, 0.5 wt % of the
photoinitiator (BAPO) was added to produce the liquid printing ink.
Based on functional requirements, a photochromic additive was incorporated
into the previously prepared liquid printing ink. To minimize bubble
formation during stirring, a magnetic stirrer was used at a controlled
speed of 50 rpm to ensure thorough mixing. The specific photochromic
additives included 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,3-dimethylindoline-6′-nitrobenzopyran
(SP1, 0.02 wt %) and (E)-3-(2-(2-hydroxyphenylethenyl)-5-methoxy-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-1-ium-1-yl)­propane-1-sulfonate
(SP2, 0.02 wt %). The prepared spiropyran additive (SP1 or SP2) was
incorporated into the printable ink for future use. The detailed ink
formulations are reported inTable S1.
Printing was conducted via a bottom-up 3D printer (Phrozen Sonic 4K
2022) with a 405 nm ParaLED Matrix 3.0 light source with 2.5 mW/cm2irradiance. The print models were prepared via a Phrozen
Dental Synergy Slicer, and all the samples were printed with a layer
height of 100 μm and an exposure time of 5.5 s. Following the
printing process, the printed samples were cleansed via a paper towel
moistened with isopropyl alcohol to eliminate residual resin at the
surface. Subsequently, the samples were air-dried for 2 min, and then
UV postcured (405 nm, LED radiant of 6 W) for 10 min at ambient temperature.

To fabricate
an environmentally responsive badge, PR1 and PR2 were used to print
a university logo that exhibits UV light and thermal responsiveness,
respectively. The printed logos from PR1 and PR2 were positioned within
a 25 mm circular mold. Subsequently, a nonphotochromic ink (PR3) was
poured over the logo to encapsulate it and then cured under 405 nm
UV light to finalize the sealing process. After cured, the badge was
demolded to obtain the final responsive badge.

1H NMR spectroscopy of
DPBMA and its synthesis precursor was performed using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) on a 400 MHz Varian VXR spectrometer, with the sample
dissolved in DMSO-d6at 25 °C and
recorded over 16 scans.

Attenuated total reflection-Fourier
transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were acquired via a Bruker VERTEX
70 spectrometer equipped with a diamond single-reflection ATR accessory
and scanned over the range of 4000--500 cm–1. To
further investigate the changes in the absorbance of the dynamic ester,
an ATR accessory with a heater was used to record the spectra across
a temperature range of 40 to 160 °C.

The thermal stability
of the cured resins was analyzed via thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) on a TA Discovery Instruments Q5500 instrument with
an autosampler using a temperature ramp from 25 to 700 °C at
a rate of 10 °C min–1under atmospheric flow.

Tensile testing was performed on an Instron testing apparatus equipped
with a load cell capacity of 1 kN to ascertain the mechanical characteristics
of the materials under examination. The applied strain rate was 5
mm/min, and the samples for tensile testing were printed in a dumbbell
configuration with dimensions of 48.75 × 3.25 × 1.3 mm3. The measurement was repeated five times to ensure reproducibility.

The glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured via a TA Instruments Discovery HR20 instrument in
DMA mode (1 Hz, 0.2% strain, heating rate: 3 °C min–1). The test samples had dimensions of 20 mm × 5 mm × 2
mm.

A UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda950, PerkinElmer)
was used to measure the reflectance and transmittance of the photochromic
film across a wavelength range of 190–2500 nm, featuring a
dual-beam configuration and an integrating sphere. The International
Commission on Illumination (CIE) diagram and the coordinate was obtained
using the transmittance data from UV–vis-NIR spectrum.

UV–vis spectra of the photochromic compounds were recorded
on a Hewlett-Packard HP 8543 spectrometer in a quartz cuvette with
a path length of 1 cm. Irradiation was performed in situ via an optic
fiber-coupled LED (Thorlabs) (455 nm, 1 A; 365 nm, 1 A). Solutions
in acetonitrile or Milli-Q water were prepared the day before the
measurements were taken and stored in the dark. The final concentration
of the solutions was 2 × 10–5M.

A portable
365 nm UV flashlight (5 W) and LED visible light (5
W) were used to excite the photochromic compounds and induce a color
change process. Additionally, the heat gun was set to 80 °C and
used to induce color change and shape reprogramming.

The reshaping
of the printed specimen was performed by heating
it to 80 °C using a heat gun. At this temperature, the material
becomes highly malleable. External manual force was applied to bend,
twist, or fold the sample into a temporary shape. Once the desired
shape was achieved, the heat gun was removed while maintaining the
external force. Once cooled, the printed specimens retained its programmed
shape. This reshaping process is repeatable, allowing the material
to be reprogrammed into various shape.

Adaptive materials, which integrate real-time responsiveness and
multifunctionality through a dynamic interplay between structure and
function, represent a significant advancement in smart fabrication.
Among additive manufacturing, mSLA printing offers a scalable photopolymerization
process that provides a promising platform for adaptive manufacturing
when functional additives are incorporated. As illustrated inFigure, the introduction
of dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) enables the printed materials
with programmable shape memory and reprocessability. In parallel,
the incorporation of spiropyran additives imparts stimuli-responsive
color changes. The combination of these functionalities endows 3D-printed
constructs with adaptive behavior in response to external stimuli.
These capabilities directly address the limitations of conventional
mSLA printing materials, which often lack tunability and postfabrication
adaptability. Specifically, the incorporation of dual dynamic covalent
bonds (DCBs) facilitates bond exchange and topological rearrangement
under elevated conditions, enabling shape reprogramming and recovery
without compromising structural integrity. Furthermore, the photochromic
nature of spiropyran provides a visual feedback mechanism, allowing
printed components to dynamically respond to light and heat, thereby
extending their utility beyond static applications. This advancement
establishes mSLA printing as a viable strategy for adaptive manufacturing,
where the properties and functionalities of printed materials can
evolve in response to environmental stimuli.

The printing process
was successful for all formulations, yielding
stable prints, with specific formulations detailed inTable S1. The thermal stability and thermally
activated shape reconfigurability of the printed samples were investigated
via TGA and ATR-FTIR equipped with a heater. First, the heat resistance
of the molecular switches (SP1 and SP2) was confirmed, showing only
a 4–5% weight loss before reaching 200 °C (Figures S4 and S5). To further assess the thermal
stability of the switchable prints, a series of thin films were printed
using the aforementioned resin formulations. A series of thin films
of PR1 (containing the photochromic switch SP1), the PR2 (containing
the thermochromic switch SP2), and the PR3 film (without molecular
switches) were analyzed. As shown inFigurea–c, the comparative analysis indicated
that their thermogravimetric degradation curves exhibit very similar
trends, with a mass loss of less than 3% occurring at approximately
100 to 120 °C, mainly due to the hygroscopic water loss. Additionally,
the incorporation of photochromic or thermochromic additives slightly
decreased the temperature at which 5% weight loss occurred from 250
to 230 °C (Figuresa-c). To better understand the behavior of the material during heating
and cooling, infrared spectroscopy was performed over a temperature
range of 40 to 160 °C (Figured). The results revealed that as the temperature increased,
the infrared spectrum exhibited a redshift in the absorption band
at approximately 3500 cm–1, indicating a weakening
of hydrogen bonding within the polymer chain network. This weakening of intermolecular forces facilitates shape
reprogramming at elevated temperatures by softening the material’s
mechanical behavior. Conversely, the absorption shifted back to its
original state as the temperature decreased, indicating the reversible
nature of the hydrogen bonding interactions.

emission of the PR2 film.

The printed objects (Figuree) demonstrated thermal shape reprogramming, evidenced by
the reshaping of the thin printed splines. Benefiting from the incorporated
dual dynamic networks, the material exhibits both toughness (Figure S6) and a moderate glass transition temperature
(80 °C,Tg) (Figure S7). The International Commission on Illumination (CIE)
diagram is used to represent the color of the photo- and thermally
responsive films (PR1 and PR2) after exposure to UV light or heat.
For photochromic materials, high transmittance is essential as it
allows effective light penetration, enhancing the material’s
responsiveness to light stimuli and maximizing the visibility and
contrast of photoinduced color changes. The emission of the two types
of photochromic polymeric films, based on PR1 and PR2 respectively,
is presented on the CIE chromaticity diagram. The emission color coordinates
for the PR1 film (referred to as R inFiguref) are 0.372 and 0.381, and for the PR2 film
(named as Y inFiguref), the coordinates are 0.444 and 0.459.

In this study, two
types of spiropyran-based molecules were separately
incorporated into a photocurable resin to develop photo- and thermally
responsive printed structures. Photoswitch SP1 was incorporated into
the resin PR1, the University logo was printed, and the UV-responsive
behavior of the printed logo was tested. Upon exposure to 365 nm UV
light, the logo became clearly visible, demonstrating a color change
to red (Figureb).
The color change results from the reversible transition between the
closed spiropyran (SP) form and the open merocyanine (MC) form. In
the closed SP state, the molecule adopts a nonconjugated structure,
lacking an absorbance peak in the visible spectrum, rendering it colorless.
However, upon exposure to UV light, the molecule undergoes ring-opening
to form the planar, conjugated MC state, which absorbs visible light
and results in a distinct color change (Figurea). The fluorescent mechanism of spiropyran
is primarily driven by its isomerization under ultraviolet (UV) light.
Upon UV exposure, the chromophore, typically a benzene ring, absorbs
light energy, transitioning from the ground state to the excited state.
As the molecule returns to the ground state, energy is released in
the form of photons, resulting in fluorescence. The whole process of pattern emergence and luminescence
is provided inVideo S1. As shown inFigurec–d, the SP-to-MC
transition was completed in approximately 250 s, indicating a significant
color change in a relatively short period. This rapid response time
highlights the system’s capability to undergo visible transitions
under 365 nm UV stimulation. Furthermore, the printed complex hollow
fullerene structures provided a clearer visual representation of the
color fading process (MC-to-SP transition) in a 3D model (Video S2). The digital images inFiguref–g vividly illustrate
the high-resolution and color-retention properties of the film. Notably,
the pink color required significantly longer time (approximately 3000
s, as shown inFigureg) to revert to its original state, indicating potential applications
in areas requiring extended color retention, such as smart windows,
where durability and accuracy are crucial. This photochromic film,
when applied to windows, offers a promising approach for enhancing
building energy efficiency by dynamically adjusting light transmission
to reduce indoor heating and cooling demands. This functionality indirectly
supports carbon neutrality efforts and actions against climate change
by lowering the energy consumption associated with air conditioning
systems.

Classically, spiropyrans
absorb energy from UV radiation to achieve
molecular switching. More recently, a series of protonated merocyanine
has been developed, which are able to ring-close, to form their corresponding
SP form upon irradiation with visible light. The reverse process spontaneously
happens in the dark to yield the protonated merocyanine form.,Moreover, the ring opening reaction is associated with the appearance
of coloration, thanks to the increase in conjugation of the molecule.
The ring-opening process is thermodynamic and is accelerated by the
application of heat. In this study, we utilized the spiropyran (SP2),
generated upon irradiation with visible light, as a component in a
printable ink formulation where the color change can be stimulated
by temperature. Using the same protocol previously discussed, both
the university logo and the fullerene model were prepared with resin
PR2. The mechanism underlying the reversible transition of SP2 is
analogous to that of SP1, involving a ring-opening or ring-closing
process (Figurea).
As shown inFigureb andVideo S3, the logo exhibited no
fluorescence, and the color change occurred at a moderate rate (Figured). The time evolution
of the UV–visible absorbance (Figurec) in the visible wavelength range for the
SP–to-MC and MC–to-SP transitions is presented inFigures S12 and S13. The entire color fading
process of the 3D model is provided inVideo S4. Notably, the color change takes approximately 2500 s (Figured) to reach full
contrast, whereas the yellow color under visible light faded within
just 25 s (Figuree), indicating that light-generated SP2 bears a stable temperature
response suitable for temperature indicators, with potential applications
in memory retention and enhanced accuracy.

Thermoplastic 3D objects prepared from extrusion printing exhibit
lower temperature resistance than thermosetting 3D printing materials
via ink curing, mainly because thermoplastics are linear polymers
that can melt and flow instead of being permanently fixed via chemically
cross-linked networks. Vitrimer printing
altered this phenomenon, as the dynamic covalent bonds reprogrammed
the printed structures and prevented geometric collapse through thermally
activated DCNs. As previously reported by Chen and co-workers, dual
dynamic vitrimers that contain disulfide and ester bonds can be reprocessed
when heated at elevated temperatures. In the polymer network formed by mSLA printing, the stable and irreversible
C–C bonds resulting from methacrylate photopolymerization constitute
the fixed phase, which retains the original shape. In contrast, disulfide
bonds and β-hydroxy esters form the reversible phase, allowing
chain segment mobility when the temperature exceeds the bond exchange
threshold. As shown inFigurea–f, upon heating the material to itsTg, the reversible phase softens, enabling chain mobility
and polymer deformation under external force. After maintaining the
deformed shape, lowering the temperature reduces the segment mobility,
halts bond exchange, and stabilizes the temporarily reprogramming
shape. When reheated, the reversible phase reactivates, allowing chain
segments to move again. Driven by internal stress, the polymer returns
to its initial shape, completing the shape memory cycle. In this work,
incorporating thermally responsive molecules into the photosensitive
resin endowed the material with dual responsiveness, allowing it to
adapt both its shape and color in response to temperature changes.
By mixing SP2 with the resin PR2, we successfully printed advanced
structures, such as flowers, that demonstrated simultaneous shape
and color changes, showcasing their potential as adaptive 3D-printed
materials. Under heat flow at 80 °C, the flower transitions from
a closed to an open state while its color shifts from colorless to
yellow, demonstrating both shape transformation and chromatic response
(Figureg–j,Video S5). This process is fully reversible,
with the flower returning to a closed state as the color fades upon
cooling (Figurek–n,Video S6). These dual-responsive materials offer
customizable geometries and color transitions, making them highly
adaptable for temperature-triggered applications such as 4D printed
bionic smart materials and environment
and performance indicators.

In summary, we present
the development of environmentally friendly,
photochromic and dual-responsive thermochromic printing inks through
a solvent-free polymerization process. By incorporating dynamic covalent
bonds and spiropyran-based molecular switches, the resulting printed
structures demonstrate remarkable shape memory properties, high thermal
stability, and tunable chromatic responses. The dual-responsive behavior,
where both shape and color transitions are activated thermally, paves
the way for advanced applications in domains such as anticounterfeiting,
optoelectronics, and information encryption. The use of dynamic covalent
networks in the printing process allows for highly customizable material
properties that can endure thermal reconfigurations without geometric
deformation. This work significantly advances the design of sustainable
3D printing ink that aligns with both cost-effective and functional
demands, laying the groundwork for future innovations in smart material
applications.
