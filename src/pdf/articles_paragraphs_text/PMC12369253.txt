Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) causes irreversible valvular injury and mortality globally. Easily detectable miRNAs may provide valuable perspectives into the clinical management of RHD. This study aimed to explore the role of miR-134-5p in RHD progression.

A total of 167 subjects (80 non-RHD, 87 RHD) were included in this study. The level of miR-134-5p was evaluated by qRT-PCR, and its diagnostic value was assessed by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between miR-134-5p and RHD severity was evaluated by correlation analysis. The association between miR-134-5p expression and RHD prognosis was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate COX regression analysis. The regulatory relationship between miR-134-5p and lysine acetyltransferase 7 (KAT7) was assessed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. In vitro cell experiment was used to assess the regulatory mechanism of miR-134-5p in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs).

Upregulated miR-134-5p in RHD was correlated with RHD severity and could diagnose RHD from rheumatic fever (RF). Low miR-134-5p level was associated with a better prognosis of RHD and could serve as an independent prognostic factor for RHD. Suppression of miR-134-5p in hVICs injury could attenuate the inflammation and oxidative stress by regulating the KAT7 expression.

Upregulated miR-134-5p expression showed a diagnostic and prognostic value in RHD. MiR-134-5p may be involved in RHD by regulating the inflammation and oxidative stress in hVIC injury via targeting KAT7.

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a condition characterized by the dysfunction of the heart valve due to rheumatic fever (RF) recurring repeatedly. Over time, chronic valve dysfunction can progress to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke, profoundly impacting the quality of life and healthcare systems [1]. Globally, RHD affects over 15.6–19.6 million individuals worldwide, with 12.5% of death cases occurring in low-resource regions [1]. Its prevalence peaks in adolescents and young adults, particularly affecting females more severely than males [2,3]. Current diagnostic approaches for RHD rely on clinical evaluation, echocardiography, and serological markers like anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, these methods exhibit significant limitations. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) exhibits poor specificity and a high false-positive rate. Similarly, conventional biomarkers show inadequate discriminatory power as CRP merely indicates systemic inflammation, while ASO titers only confirm prior streptococcal exposure. Importantly, chronic RHD patients might exhibit normal CRP/ASO levels as these acute-phase reactants poorly correlate with established valvular pathology [4–6]. Treatment strategies remain constrained by antibiotic resistance risks with prolonged steroid use and the prohibitive costs of surgical interventions for advanced cases. Therefore, an in-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of RHD will help provide new ideas for developing novel diagnoses, treatments, and clinical care for RHD.

The pathogenesis of RHD involves a complex interplay of valve inflammation, valve oxidative stress, and fibrotic remodeling. Heart valve inflammation and oxidative stress drive heart valve damage through a synergistic action. The investigation of aberrant moleculars during valvular injury could yield novel biomarkers for early RHD diagnosis, enable prediction of adverse clinical outcomes, and offer innovative perspectives for RHD therapeutic management. Recent studies have illuminated the role of non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), as key modulators of the pathological cascade in heart valve damage, including RHD. For instance, miR-155-5p downregulation could inhibit the progression of valvular injury in RHD by targeting the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways [7]. The development of RHD could also be influenced by the dysregulated circ_0003748 through regulating miR-577 to affect the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby affecting the cell functions of human valve interstitial cells (hVICs) [8]. Additionally, downregulated miR-101 was associated with the progression of RHD and could contribute the RHD development by regulating TLR2 [9]. Collectively, these studies suggest that dysregulated miRNAs during the heart valve injury have the potential to serve as both novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers for RHD. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of miRNA-based biomarkers and their precise molecular mechanisms in RHD pathogenesis warrant further investigation.

Comprehensive profiling of miRNAs in RHD patients demonstrated significant upregulation of miR-134-5p [10]. In addition, this elevated miR-134-5p expression was functionally linked to activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and promotion of oxidative stress in cardiomyocyte injury [11,12], both established pathological mechanisms in RHD-associated valve damage. Based on the above information, it could be speculated that miR-134-5p upregulation may play a contributory role in RHD pathogenesis. However, the association between miR-134-5p and RHD and the possible regulatory mechanism of miR-134-5p in RHD still needs further exploration. To evaluate the clinical significance and regulatory mechanism of miR-134-5p in RHD, the expression of miR-134-5p in RHD patients was analyzed, and the effect of miR-134-5p in hVICs injury was investigated by in vitro cell experiments.

A total of 167 RF subjects, including 87 RHD subjects (RHD group) and 80 subjects without RHD (Non-RHD group), were selected in the Shaanxi Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine from 2022 to 2024. RHD subjects were diagnosed according to the ultrasonic cardiogram and electrocardiograph (ECG). Healthy individuals who underwent physical examination in the same hospital during this period were enrolled as the healthy control (HC) group (n= 70). All subjects or their families accepted this study objective and signed the informed consent. The Ethics Committee of Shaanxi Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine also approved this study.

Inclusion criteria for RHD subjects: (1) patients were first diagnosed as RHD, (2) patients with or without mitral stenosis (MS), and accepted mitral valve replacement.

Exclusion criteria for RHD subjects: (1) patients in the active stage of rheumatism or rheumatoid activity were under control for less than 3 months, (2) patients with comorbidities such as actue heart failure, (3) patients with any severe liver and kidney dysfunction, (4) patients with severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, (5) patients with any infectious diseases, (6) patients with acute and chronic lung diseases.

Human valve interstitial cells (hVICs, Innoprot, Spain).

Baseline information, including age, body mass index (BMI), gender, hypertension (HYP) history, and diabetes mellitus (DM) history, was collected from all subjects. Additionally, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), pulmonary artery pressure (PASP), mitral stenosis (MS), and New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade [13] were also recorded.

Blood sample processing: The fasting blood samples of the enrolled subjects were collected in the morning after they were hospitalized. The blood samples were allowed to stand for 20 min at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 3700 rpm for 10 min at 4 ℃ to collect the serum. The serum samples were then stored at −80 ℃ for further analysis.

All subjects were followed for 5 to 60 months, and the progression-free survival status (PFS, survival period without disease progression) of RHD subjects after treatment was recorded.

The hVICs were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 105and then cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA), which was supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Corning Incorporated, USA). The cells were cultured at a temperature of 37 °C, with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, in the incubator (Binder, Germany). The cells were passaged when they had reached a confluence of 80–90%. A subsequent experiment was conducted in the passage of 4 to 6, and each experiments were repeated 6 times.

The cell injury model was performed by the LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). LPS (200 ng/mL) was added to cells and cultured for 24 h under the standard culture conditions [14].

Suppression of miR-134-5p and lysine acetyltransferase 7 (KAT7) in cells was performed with miR-134-5p inhibitor (100 nM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and siRNA-KAT7 (si-KAT7, 30 nM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), respectively. The overexpression of miR-134-5p was performed by the transfection of miR-134-5p mimic (50 nM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The hVICs were counted and seeded in the 6-well plates and transfected with miR-134-5p inhibitor/mimic and si KAT7 with the help of lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (1.5 µL/µg RNA, Invitrogen, USA) and incubated for at least 48 h. Negative controls were conducted by transfecting negative control (inhibitor NC, mimic NC) and siRNA negative control (si NC) into hVICs with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA).

An online database, TargetScanHuman database (https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/), was used to predict the binding sites of miR-134-5p in KAT7. The regulatory relationship between miR-134-5p and KAT7 was further assessed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type 3’UTR segments of KAT7 containing the miR-134-5p binding sites were cloned into pGL3 luciferase reporter vectors to conduct KAT7-WT reporter vector and mutated at the miR-134-5p binding sites to conduct the KAT7-MUT reporter vector. The KAT7-WT or KAT7-MUT reporter vectors were co-transfected with miR-134-5p inhibitor and inhibitor NC with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) into hVICs, respectively. After being incubated for 48 h, the relative luciferase activity of KAT7 was analyzed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, USA).

The total RNA was extracted from the serum (miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit, Qiagen) and cells (TRIzol, Invitrogen). The RNA concentration/purity was evaluated by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA; A260/A280: 1.8–2.0). For cDNA synthesis, the RNA was reverse-transcribed by the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara, Japan) for KAT7 and the TaqMan MicroRNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) for miR-134-5p. Quantitative real-time PCR amplification was conducted using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) on the ABI 7900HT system. Relative expression levels were calculated through the 2−ΔΔCtmethod, normalized to spike-in cel-miR-39 and GAPDH internal controls.

‌Inflammatory Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) evaluation:‌ Cell supernatants and lysates were centrifuged at 3700 rpm and analyzed using ELISA kits (TNF-α: RayBiotech Life, USA‌; IL-6: Abcam, UK‌; IL-1β: Elabscience, China‌).

‌Oxidative Stress (MDA, SOD) evaluation:‌ The oxidative stress of the cells was analyzed using MDA (BIOXYTECH®MDA-586TM Assay, OXIS International, USA))‌ and SOD (Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit, Cayman Chemical, USA)‌. For MDA evaluation, the cells were lysed and mixed with thiobarbituric acid, heated (95 ℃, 60 min), and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. For SOD analysis, the cell supernatants were centrifuged at 10000 rpm, 4 ℃ for 15 min, and incubated with WST-1/xanthine oxidase; the SOD activity was quantified at 450 nm.

GraphPad Prism 9.0 and SPSS were employed for the data analysis. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using unpaired Student’s t-tests and a Chi-square test. For multi-group comparisons, one-way ANOVA was applied. The diagnostic value of miR-134-5p on RHD was evaluated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox regression analysis were employed to assess the association of miR-134-5p expression with RHD prognosis, with parallel Kaplan-Meier curves confirming the proportional hazards assumption required for Cox modeling. Pearson correlation coefficients quantified linear relationships between the expression of miR-134-5p and KAT7. AP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The baseline information of all subjects was shown in Table1. The HC group was comprised of 39 males and 31 females with an average age of 39.97 years and a BMI of 221.21 kg/m2. There were 46 males and 34 females in the non-RHD groups with an average age of 40.95 years and a BMI of 22.28 kg/m2. The RHD groups consisted of 41 males and 46 females with an average age of 41.16 years and a BMI of 22.66 kg/m2. There were no significant differences in age (P= 0.245 for HC vs. Non-RHD;P= 0.178 for HC vs. RHD;P= 0.792 for Non-RHD vs. RHD), BMI (P= 0.764 for HC vs. Non-RHD;P= 0.080 for HC vs. RHD;P= 0.108 for Non-RHD vs. RHD), gender (P= 0.826 for HC vs. Non-RHD;P= 0.285 for HC vs. RHD;P= 0.180 for Non-RHD vs. RHD), HYP history (P= 0.783 for HC vs. Non-RHD;P= 0.068 for HC vs. RHD;P= 0.107 for Non-RHD vs. RHD), and DM history (P= 0.873 for HC vs. Non-RHD;P= 0.346 for HC vs. RHD;P= 0.416 for Non-RHD vs. RHD) among the HC, Non-RHD, and RHD groups. However, the RHD group exhibited significantly lower LVEF (RHD: 48.12 ± 4.96% vs. Non-RHD: 57.44 ± 3.41%,P< 0.0001) and more narrow LVEDD (RHD: 49.75 ± 4.66 mm vs. Non-RHD: 43.00 ± 4.59 mm,P< 0.0001), alongside higher PASP (RHD: 26.07 ± 3.00 mmHg vs. Non-RHD: 16.95 ± 1.98 mmHg,P< 0.0001).

No significance in miR-134-5p expression between the HC and non-RHD groups could be observed (Fig.1a). Elevated miR-134-5p levels were further observed in the serum of the RHD group compared with the non-RHD group and HC group (P< 0.0001, Fig.1a). The miR-134-5p exhibited a significant diagnostic value (AUC = 0.903, sensitivity = 85.06%, and specificity = 83.75%) on RHD from RF subjects according to the ROC curve analysis (Fig.1b).

There was a close relationship between miR-134-5p and the RHD severity (Fig.2). A negative correlation was observed between miR-134-5p and LVEF with a correlation coefficient r of −0.605 (P< 0.0001, Fig.2a). The miR-134-5p expression was positively correlated with LVEDD (r= 0.626,P< 0.0001, Fig.2b) and PASP (r= 0.602,P< 0.0001, Fig.2c). Additionally, the level of miR-134-5p in RHD subjects who developed MS was elevated than that of RHD subjects without MS (P< 0.0001, Fig.2d). For RHD subjects with different NYHA grades, higher NYHA grades were associated with higher miR-134-5p levels (P< 0.05, Fig.2e).

In the follow-up study, three RHD subjects were lost to follow-up. The RHD group was further divided into a high miR-134-5p expression group (n= 44) and a low miR-134-5p group (n= 40) by using the average miR-134-5p expression level as the cutoff, following confirmation of normal distribution via P-P plot analysis. The PFS rate (Fig.3) of RHD subjects with a low miR-134-5p level was compared with those with high miR-134-5p expression. The log-rank test revealed a significant difference in PFS rate (P= 0.046), with the RHD subjects in the high miR-134-5p expression group demonstrating a worse PFS through the K-M survival analysis.

The multivariate COX regression analysis identified independent prognostic factors for RHD with no variable adjusted (Table2). MiR-134-5p showed significant significance on RHD prognosis (HR: 6.601, 95% CI: 1.592–27.371,P= 0.009). Additionally, LVEF (HR: 0.260, 95% CI: 0.069–0.977,P= 0.046), LVEDD (HR: 0.203, 95% CI: 0.050–0.820,P= 0.046), PASP (HR: 4.283, 95% CI: 1.416–12.954,P= 0.010), MS (HR: 5.545, 95% CI: 1.189–25.848,P= 0.029), and NYHA grade (HR: 6.994, 95% CI: 1.381–35.412,P= 0.019) were also revealed to be independent prognostic factors for RHD.

The correlation between miR-134-5p and KAT7 was revealed in Fig.4. The serum level of miR-134-5p was negatively related to KAT7 expression in the RHD subjects with the correlation coefficient r of −0.678 (P< 0.0001, Fig.4a). The dual-luciferase reporter assay further confirmed the association between miR-134-5p and KAT7 (Fig.4b and c). Overexpression of miR-134-5p in hVICs could suppress the relative luciferase activity of KAT7 in the KAT7-WT group (P< 0.001), and inhibition of miR-134-5p expression could facilitate the luciferase activity of KAT7 (P< 0.01). Nevertheless, a statistically significant discrepancy in the relative luciferase activity of KAT7 was not observed among the KAT7-MUT group (P> 0.05).

LPS significantly increased the expression of miR-134-5p in hVICs compared to the control group (P< 0.001, Fig.5a), and this promoting effect was suppressed by the presence of the miR-134-5p inhibitor (P< 0.01). In contrast, LPS induced a significant downregulation of KATT7 in hVICs (P< 0.0001, Fig.5b), which was partially reversed by the involvement of the miR-134-5p inhibitor (P< 0.001). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that interference with the expression of KAT7 in hVICs induced by LPS can significantly reduce the level of KAT7 expression that was elevated after the inhibition of miR-134-5p expression (P< 0.01).

Following LPS stimulation, hVICs exhibited significantly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, with marked increases observed in IL-6 (Fig.6a), IL-1β (Fig.6b), and TNF-α (Fig.6c) compared to untreated controls (P< 0.0001). The elevated level of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α could further be suppressed by the downregulated miR-134-5p expression (P< 0.0001). Additionally, the knockdown of KAT7 following miR-134-5p inhibition rescued the reduced IL-6 (P< 0.05), IL-1β (P< 0.01), and TNF-α (P< 0.01) levels caused by miR-134-5p suppression.

LPS stimulation led to elevated MDA levels (P< 0.0001) in hVICs (Fig.6d). The reduction of miR-134-5p expression demonstrated significant attenuation of MDA production in LPS-stimulated hVICs, as evidenced by the ability of the miR-134-5p inhibitor to effectively counteract the LPS-induced elevation in MDA levels (P< 0.0001). However, further KAT7 knockdown could reverse the reductions in MDA levels that were suppressed by miR-134-5p downregulation (P< 0.01). Following LPS stimulation in hVICs, a decline in SOD levels was observed concerning the control group (P< 0.0001, Fig.6e). Downregulation of miR-134-5p in LPS-stimulated hVICs demonstrated a significant enhancement of SOD activity (P< 0.0001). The antioxidant enhancement mediated by miR-134-5p downregulation manifested through elevated SOD activity in LPS-stimulated hVICs, was significantly abolished following KAT7 inhibition (P< 0.01).

RHD imposes severe cardiovascular morbidity through valvular damage and myocardial inflammation, with persistent oxidative stress exacerbating tissue fibrosis. Emerging evidence implicates miR-134-5p as a dual mediator in cardiac pathology - it amplifies pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades (IL-6/STAT3) [14] while suppressing antioxidant defenses via XIAP [12]. MiR-134-5p coordinated regulation of both inflammatory and redox imbalances may mechanistically link to RHD progression. To evaluate the association between miR-134-5p and RHD, the expression and possible regulatory mechanism of miR-134-5p in RHD patients were investigated, aiming to provide a better understanding of the clinical management of RHD.

In RHD, chronic valvular damage (e.g., mitral stenosis) restricts left ventricular (LV) filling, increasing LVEDD leading to LV atrophy and fibrosis, and thus lowering LVEF [15]. Concurrently, elevated left atrial pressure from valvular obstruction induces pulmonary venous congestion, increasing PASP via passive hemodynamic transmission [16]. In this study, the baseline information results also revealed that there was a significant decrease in LVEF, elevated LVEDD, and PASP in comparison with non-RHD patients. MiR-134-5p exhibited significant upregulation in RHD, with ROC curve analysis demonstrating robust diagnostic efficacy in RHD from RF. However, there was no significant difference in miR-134-5p expression between the healthy individuals and RF patients without RHD, indicating that miR-134-5p upregulation might be specifically associated with valvular involvement and cardiac injury in RHD pathogenesis rather than being a general feature of RF. The relation between miR-134-5p and RHD severity was further corroborated by that the level of miR-134-5p was related to the levels of LVEF, LVEDD, PASP, MS, and NYHA grades. As stated previously, it could be known that LVEF, LVEDD, and PASP reflect myocardial function and cardiac conditions. In addition, MS could lead to progressive left atrial pressure overload, causing pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure [17]. A higher NYHA grade also implies worse cardiac function in RHD patients [13]. Thus, the close relationship between miR-134-5p and cardiac indexes could illustrate that miR-134-5p was correlated with the severity of RHD. Additionally, a higher PFS rate was observed in the RHD patients with lower miR-134-5p levels, and based on the multivariate COX regression analysis, miR-134-5p was identified as the independent prognostic factor for RHD, suggesting that miR-134-5p had the potential to serve as a reliable prognostic indicator for RHD and a valuable monitoring tool for clinical nursing interventions in RHD prognosis. For RHD patients with lower miR-134-5p expression, closer attention might be paid to avoid the worst possible prognosis. In addition to miR-134-5p, several other indicators, such as LVEF, LVEDD, PASP, MS, and NYHA grade, could also be regarded as independent prognostic factors for RHD, which was consistent with previous studies [18–21].

Upregulation of miR-134-5p observed in the serum of patients with RHD suggested its potential involvement in the pathological mechanisms underlying RHD development and progression. To further explore the possible regulatory mechanism of miR-134-5p in RHD, downstream genes of miR-134-5p were explored through a comprehensive literature review using “miR-134-5p” and “myocardial” as keywords and identified potential cardiac-related targets, and it was found that miR-134-5p knockdown could inhibit myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis after myocardial infarction by modulating KAT7 and decreasing oxidative stress levels [22]. In addition, the binding sites of miR-134-5p in KAT7 were also predicted by the online database of TargetScanHuman and the dual-luciferase reporter assay, which was consistent with a previous study validating the regulatory relationship between miR-134-5p and KAT7 [22]. The negative relationship between serum miR-134-5p and KAT7 expression of RHD could also demonstrate that there was an interaction relationship between miR-134-5p and KAT7. The pathogenesis of RHD involves a vicious cycle where sustained inflammatory responses and oxidative stress initially induce valvular damage, which subsequently triggers the dysfunctional activation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) - the pivotal cellular mediators that drive pathological extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, ultimately culminating in irreversible structural deterioration and clinically significant valvular dysfunction including stenosis and regurgitation [23]. Thus, this study employed the hVICs injury model to investigate the effect of the miR-134-5p/KAT7 axis in RHD progression. LPS has been established as an effective inducer of VIC damage, recapitulating key aspects of RHD pathophysiology [14,24]. The expression of miR-134-5p was found to be elevated in hVICs following LPS stimulation, and this was aligned with the upregulated miR-134-5p expression in the clinical study. KAT7 expression was reduced in the LPS-induced hVIC injury. Further experimental evidence demonstrated that miR-134-5p downregulation exerted protective effects in hVIC injury models by reducing inflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress levels, indicating its pathogenic role in promoting hVIC damage. KAT7, which functions as a histone acetyltransferase regulating gene expression via chromatin modification, plays crucial roles in cell cycle progression and DNA replication, while also participating in inflammatory responses and oxidative stress regulation [25,26]. This study demonstrated that KAT7 knockdown exacerbated inflammatory cascades and oxidative stress in LPS-induced hVIC injury. This heightened damage stimulated by KAT7 knockdown effectively abolished the protective effect conferred by miR-134-5p inhibition, thereby revealing the essential function of KAT7 in safeguarding hVICs against injury. These findings provided novel mechanistic insights into RHD pathogenesis, suggesting that the miR-134-5p/KAT7 regulatory axis represented a promising therapeutic target for developing innovative treatment strategies against RHD progression.

Although this study provided insights into the possible clinical significance and molecular mechanisms of miR-134-5p in RHD, several limitations should be acknowledged. While the present study has successfully identified serum-based biomarkers for early RHD detection, it should be noted that our findings currently lack supporting evidence from tissue analyses and animal models regarding the expression patterns of miR-134-5p and KAT7. This limitation highlights the need for future investigations to systematically examine the correlation between circulating and tissue-specific expression levels of these biomarkers, which would provide more comprehensive insights into their pathophysiological roles in RHD progression. A critical gap lies in the lack of direct investigation into valvular fibrosis and osteogenic differentiation of cardiac valve cells, which are central to the progression of RHD [27]. A previous study had confirmed that VE-cadherin was downregulated in myocardial fibrosis [28], and upregulation of miR-134-5p could facilitate the VE-cadherin levels to suppress aortic endothelial dysfunction [29]. Similarly, in the progression of RHD, miR-134-5p may play a function in valvular fibrosis through the regulation of VE-cadherin expression. This hypothesis should be investigated in subsequent experimental studies. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that both TLR4 and NF-κB signaling pathways play distinct roles in rheumatic cardiac complications, with TLR4 implicated in cardiac fibrosis and NF-κB in valvular lesions, and these signaling pathways could be regulated through KAT7 expression [30–32]. These findings underscore the need for a comprehensive investigation of the miR-134-5p/KAT7/TLR4 and miR-134-5p/KAT7/NF-κB regulatory axes through integrated in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches to elucidate their precise mechanistic contributions to RHD pathogenesis.

Upregulated expression of microRNA-134-5p was identified as a valuable diagnostic marker for RHD, exhibiting a correlation with the severity of the condition. Furthermore, it was identified as an independent prognostic factor for RHD. The regulatory mechanism of miR-134-5p in RHD may be that it regulates the inflammation and oxidative stress in hVICs by targeting KAT7.
