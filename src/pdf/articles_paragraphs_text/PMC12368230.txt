Uterine fibroids are common among women of reproductive age and often recur after treatment. Accurate recurrence prediction is essential for guiding clinical decisions, yet existing models remain inadequate. This study aimed to develop a nomogram based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to estimate recurrence risk after myomectomy. We retrospectively analyzed data from 678 patients who underwent myomectomy, randomly dividing them into training and validation cohorts (7:3 ratio). LASSO regression was used to select relevant predictors, and a nomogram was constructed. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Six key predictors were identified: leiomyoma subclassification, fibroid diameter ≤ 4 cm, postoperative residual fibroids, postoperative pregnancy or childbirth, family history, and the number of fibroids detected via transvaginal ultrasound. The nomogram demonstrated strong discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. The proposed nomogram provides a reliable and practical tool for predicting fibroid recurrence, supporting personalized postoperative management and follow-up planning.

Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, their high postoperative recurrence rate poses a significant clinical challenge1. Approximately 15–30% of patients experience recurrence within 1 to 3 years, with rates approaching 50% by five years2. Several studies have indicated that age, hormonal levels, reproductive history, and lifestyle factors may influence the development and recurrence of uterine fibroids3, but existing research has produced inconsistent conclusions regarding the specific effects of these factors4. Moreover, current predictive models have considerable limitations in assessing individual recurrence risk5, failing to provide sufficient support for clinical decision-making.

The increasing availability of electronic medical records and hospital databases provides new opportunities for developing more accurate and individualized prediction tools6,7. Nonetheless, most existing models inadequately integrate key predictors and fail to achieve reliable performance8. To address these gaps, we aimed to develop a novel recurrence risk model using LASSO regression, an advanced variable selection technique. Our goal was to improve predictive accuracy and support clinical decision-making by constructing a practical, data-driven nomogram for patients undergoing myomectomy.

This study was designed as a retrospective cohort analysis to identify factors associated with uterine fibroid recurrence after myomectomy and to develop a predictive model. Clinical data were collected from patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University. A nomogram was constructed based on statistically significant predictors to estimate individual recurrence risk.

A total of 678 patients who underwent myomectomy between October 2015 and October 2022 were retrospectively included. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and personal identifiers were removed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data were extracted from the hospital’s electronic medical record system.

Collected variables included demographic characteristics (age at surgery, BMI, age at menarche, parturition history, family history), pelvic comorbidities (adenomyosis, adenomyoma, endometriosis, benign adnexal masses), and fibroid-related ultrasound parameters (number of fibroids on transvaginal ultrasound [TVS], maximum fibroid diameter [MDF], uterine volume [UV], and FIGO-based leiomyoma subclassification [LS]). Additional variables included surgical approach (SA), postoperative fibroid residue, postoperative infection (POI) , oral contraceptive use, and postoperative pregnancy or childbirth (POP or POC). POP or POC was coded as a binary variable: 1 for occurrence, 0 for none.

The BMI was categorized as follows: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal (18.5–23.9 kg/m2), overweight (24–27.9 kg/m2), and obese (> 27.9 kg/m2). Uterine volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula9. Fibroid types were classified using the FIGO system: submucosal (FIGO 0–2) vs. others (FIGO 3–8). Residual fibroids were defined as any of the following: (1) fewer fibroids removed than indicated by preoperative ultrasound; (2) gynecologist-confirmed incomplete removal; (3) fibroids detected during the first postoperative ultrasound (within 3 months).

The full inclusion process is shown in the flowchart (Fig.1).

The flowchart illustrates the screening process from the total number of patients to the final study sample.

Variable selection was performed using LASSO regression to identify key predictors of recurrence. Significant variables were then entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine independent risk factors.

A nomogram prediction model was constructed using the “nomogram” function in the R software (v.4.4.0). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted using the “roc” function, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated with the “auc” function to assess the discriminative ability of the model. The calibration curve was drawn using the “calibrate” function to evaluate the model’s calibration. The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was conducted using the “hoslem.test” function. The clinical decision curve was plotted using the “decision_curve” function to assess the clinical utility of the model. The model’s performance was evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

The CBCgrps package was used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Data that followed a normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation, and group comparisons were conducted using the t-test. For data that did not follow a normal distribution, the median (interquartile range) was used, and group comparisons were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (%), and group comparisons were carried out using the chi-square (χ2) test. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (v.4.4.0). A significance level of α = 0.05 was set, and differences were considered statistically significant whenp< 0.05.

The clinical cases included were randomly divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort at a 7:3 ratio, with a total of 476 cases in the training cohort and 202 cases in the validation cohort. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in various indicators between the two groups. The results are shown in Table1, and there were no statistically significant differences between the training and validation cohorts across all indicators (p> 0.05).

In the training cohort, LASSO regression was applied to identify predictors associated with uterine fibroid recurrence based on clinical variables. The coefficient path plot (Fig.2A) illustrates how each variable’s regression coefficient changes with the regularization parameter λ. As λ increases, coefficients for less important variables shrink toward zero, leaving only the most relevant predictors. The optimal λ was determined using tenfold cross-validation (Fig.2B), with the λ corresponding to the minimum mean squared error (left vertical dashed line) selected to reduce overfitting and enhance model robustness. LASSO regression identified six key variables: fibroid subtype (non-submucosal types), MDF, Residue, POP or POC, FH and TVS.

These six variables were subsequently entered into a multivariate binary logistic regression model. As shown in Table2, submucosal leiomyoma was identified as an independent protective factor (OR = 0.381,P= 0.015). In contrast, postoperative residue (OR = 10.746,P< 0.001), POP or POC (OR = 4.121,P< 0.001), and FH (OR = 2.045,P= 0.003) were significant independent risk factors for recurrence. While a fibroid diameter ≤ 4 cm appeared to confer a protective effect (OR = 0.817), this did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.571). Similarly, the number of fibroids on TVS was not statistically significant (P= 0.129), although a trend toward increased risk with higher counts was observed.

Based on the multivariate logistic regression results, a nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of fibroid recurrence following myomectomy (Fig.3). Each of the six predictors included in the model is assigned a point value using a corresponding scale. The total score, obtained by summing the individual scores, yields an estimated probability of recurrence. To demonstrate the application of the nomogram, we selected a representative patient from the study cohort. This patient had a maximum fibroid diameter > 4 cm, a non-submucosal fibroid subtype, postoperative residual fibroids, and four fibroids identified on transvaginal ultrasound (TVS score = 2). The total score calculated was 280, corresponding to an estimated recurrence probability of 87.8%.

Each predictor is assigned a point score, and the total score corresponds to an estimated recurrence probability. Red dashed lines illustrate an example patient. Higher total points indicate a higher probability of fibroid recurrence.

To comprehensively evaluate the model’s performance, ROC curves were generated for both the training and validation cohorts based on predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. In addition to the AUC, key classification metrics—including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy—were calculated to provide a more complete assessment of predictive performance (Table3).

Performance metrics of the predictive model in the training and validation cohorts.

In the training cohort, the model yielded an AUC of 0.834 (95% CI: 0.796–0.873) (Fig.4A), indicating excellent discriminatory ability. In the validation cohort, the AUC was 0.799 (95% CI: 0.737–0.861) (Fig.4B), demonstrating good generalizability. The C-index derived from ten-fold cross-validation in the training cohort was 0.795 (95% CI: 0.673–0.918), further supporting the model’s robustness and discriminative capability.

Calibration analysis further demonstrated strong consistency between predicted and observed recurrence probabilities. In the training cohort, the calibration curve (Fig.5A) closely aligned with the ideal reference line, with a mean absolute error of 0.019. In the validation cohort (Fig.5B), the calibration curve also showed good agreement, with a mean absolute error of 0.035. These findings suggest that the model exhibits high calibration quality and reliable performance across different datasets.

The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (χ2= 5.362,P= 0.616) indicated no significant deviation between the model’s predicted probabilities and observed outcomes (P> 0.05), supporting its good calibration and overall fit. To further assess clinical applicability, DCA was performed for both the training and validation cohorts (Fig.6). The DCA curves demonstrated that the prediction model yielded a consistently greater net benefit than the “treat all” or “treat none” strategies across a broad spectrum of threshold probabilities, particularly between 0.1 and 0.5. This threshold range reflects clinically relevant scenarios in which decisions about postoperative surveillance or preventive treatment may be considered. The red curve (training cohort) and blue curve (validation cohort) both lie above the gray line (“All”) and black line (“None”) across this range, suggesting that the model can effectively stratify patients according to their recurrence risk. This enables clinicians to prioritize intervention for high-risk individuals while avoiding unnecessary treatment in low-risk cases. Therefore, the model not only exhibits strong predictive performance but also has the potential to optimise, improving patient outcomes, and enhancing healthcare resource allocation.

Uterine fibroid recurrence after myomectomy remains a significant clinical issue, with recurrence rates ranging from 11 to 50%10. These recurrences often lead to menstrual irregularities, chronic pelvic pain, and bulk-related symptoms, significantly impairing quality of life11,12. In severe cases, fibroid recurrence can compromise fertility, posing long-term implications for reproductive health13,14. While recurrence risk is often estimated through clinical judgment and patient history, these methods lack standardization and are subject to variability15.

In this context, our study aimed to develop a reproducible and clinically interpretable prediction model using a nomogram framework. Rather than identifying novel predictors, we integrated well-established clinical variables—including fibroid number, size, subtype, postoperative residue, childbirth history, and family history—into a unified model. Using LASSO for variable selection and logistic regression for model construction, we transformed conventional risk factors into a comprehensive, individualized prediction tool. This methodological innovation enhances clinical decision-making by shifting from subjective estimates to quantified recurrence risk assessment. Importantly, we addressed a key limitation highlighted by Keizer et al. (2024), who identified gaps in existing models, such as poor clinical applicability and lack of internal validation16. Our model responds directly to these critiques by incorporating accessible clinical variables and undergoing rigorous internal validation. It offers clinicians a reliable tool for stratifying recurrence risk post-myomectomy and tailoring follow-up strategies accordingly.

To enhance clinical applicability, this nomogram-based approach can be applied at multiple postoperative time points using updated clinical data. By manually recording and plotting the predicted recurrence risks, clinicians can monitor individual risk trends over time. Although an interactive web-based tool has not yet been developed, we intend to advance its construction in future studies to further improve the model’s usability and integration into clinical practice.

Among the predictive variables, fibroid characteristics—especially size, type, and number—play central roles. Submucosal fibroids were associated with a lower recurrence risk, likely due to more complete surgical excision. In contrast, larger fibroids and multiple nodules may complicate complete removal due to irregular distribution and enhanced angiogenesis. These findings align with the hormonal theories proposed by Narine et al.17, who highlighted the role of endocrine regulation and postoperative pregnancy in mitigating recurrence through hormonal suppression of residual fibroid growth. Family history also emerged as an independent risk factor, likely reflecting underlying genetic predispositions. This supports findings by Langton et al.18, who associated recurrence with hereditary influences, reinforcing the importance of including family history in risk stratification. These observations pave the way for future research into genetic markers, such as fumarate hydratase (FH) mutations, which are implicated in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome.

We also emphasize the importance of surgical approach, as technique-related differences may affect residual burden and recurrence rates. Minimally invasive techniques, while offering faster recovery, may be limited in tactile feedback and field of view, potentially leaving undetected fibroids. Yasushi et al.19reported recurrence rates exceeding 76.2% at 8 years post-laparoscopic myomectomy, significantly higher than those following open surgery. Nonetheless, the primary goal of myomectomy—especially in reproductive-aged women—is to alleviate symptoms while preserving uterine integrity, not necessarily to achieve complete fibroid eradication. Therefore, early recurrence should be interpreted within the context of reproductive goals. A recurrence-free interval of 3–5 years may suffice for conception, and overly aggressive surgery may compromise the myometrium. A thorough pre-operative assessment of fibroid location and number, combined with appropriate surgical modality selection, is essential to optimize outcomes. For example, hysteroscopic resection of submucosal fibroids has been associated with recurrence rates as low as 0.9% at 2 years20.

Our study is not without limitations. As a single-center, retrospective analysis, it is susceptible to selection bias and lacks ethnic diversity. Additionally, lifestyle and genetic risk factors, including FH mutations, were not included in the model due to data constraints. We also acknowledge the absence of standardized perioperative hormone measurements, which may affect recurrence dynamics. Moreover, due to the limited number of robotic-assisted cases and short follow-up, these were excluded but will be analyzed in future expansions. To address these limitations, we conducted statistical controls and plan to extend the study through multicenter, prospective cohorts, incorporating radiomics and genomic markers for enhanced generalizability. A prospective biobank is being considered to support integration of genetic data in future analyses.

In this cohort study of 678 post-myomectomy patients, we developed and internally validated a predictive nomogram model using LASSO regression to quantify uterine fibroid recurrence risk. Key predictors—including fibroid subtype, maximum diameter, residue, childbirth status, family history, and fibroid count—were integrated into a clinically accessible framework. While these predictors are individually well known, their combined use in a validated, visual prediction model offers a practical tool for personalized risk assessment and postoperative planning. Limitations such as the exclusion of genetic markers and lack of external validation will be addressed in future studies. Nevertheless, this model represents a significant step toward individualized care for patients undergoing fibroid surgery and provides a foundation for precision follow-up and intervention strategies.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the doctors involved in this study for their time, dedication, and invaluable efforts. We also extend our heartfelt thanks to the patients for providing essential clinical data and for their cooperation during follow-up. Their contributions were crucial to the success of this research.
