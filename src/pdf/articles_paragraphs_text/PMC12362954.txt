To evaluate the efficacy of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation in treating refractory glaucoma and analyze the factors influencing the surgical success rate.

A 3-year retrospective analysis was conducted on 199 patients with refractory glaucoma treated with AGV, model FP7.Preoperative and postoperative data, including intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, number of glaucoma medications, and surgical outcomes, were analyzed. Complete success was defined as an IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without the use of glaucoma medications or additional filtration surgery, and a reduction in IOP of ≥ 15% from baseline. The qualified success was defined as: IOP ≤ 21 mmHg with adjunctive medications or the reduction of IOP < 15% from baseline. The overall success encompassed both complete success and qualified success.

Complete Success rates were 60.5% and 56% at years 1 and 3, respectively. Overall success rates were 83% and 74.7% at the same intervals. Visual acuity (VA) showed statistically significant improvement at year 1 (P< 0.05), but changes at year 3 were not significant (P> 0.05). Low preoperative IOP and a history of pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) were identified as protective factors contributing to the success of surgical outcomes at year 1.

AGV implantation is a safe and effective treatment for neovascular glaucoma. Preoperative IOP and a history of PRP significantly influence surgical success at one year, with success rates declining over 3 years. Careful surgical execution is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes.

Glaucoma is a prominent contributor to permanent vision loss on a global scale, with the potential to impact as many as 111 million individuals worldwide by 2040 [1–3]. Due to the gradual deterioration of vision, the common imbalance of illness between the eyes, and the neurological processes that compensate for regions of visual loss, patients typically remain unconscious of their declining eyesight until the latter stages of the disease [4–6]. Refractory glaucoma, a term encompassing neovascular, uveitic, angle recession glaucoma, other secondary forms, and residual glaucoma, presents a significant clinical challenge due to its resistance to conventional medical and surgical interventions [7]. The severity of this condition often leads to visual impairment and blindness, underscoring the urgent need for effective management strategies. Traditional treatments, including trabeculectomy with anti-metabolites and cyclodestructive procedures, frequently fail to provide adequate control of intraocular pressure (IOP) and disease progression. Therefore, it is crucial to identify cases and provide efficient therapy. Consequently, there will be a greater need for improved identification and treatment of refractory glaucoma to prevent avoidable blindness [8–10].

Surgical intervention is a widely established approach for the managing of glaucoma. In concert with technological advancements, there has been a significant expansion in the development of intraocular implants, designed to efficiently lower intraocular pressure [11]. The Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) is a surgically implanted drainage device designed to regulate the flow of fluid in the eye. It is composed of thin membranes made of silicone elastomer that open and close in response to changes in intraocular pressure (IOP). This helps prevent the occurrence of low eye pressure after surgery [12,13]. Trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage device implantation are the most common glaucoma procedures performed worldwide. While trabeculectomy is considered the most effective method, a growing trend is emerging in the use of glaucoma drainage devices. The Ahmed glaucoma valve is a widely used glaucoma drainage device that is prevalent on a global scale [14]. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the intermediate-term effects of AGV on patients with refractory glaucoma patients.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records from patients diagnosed with refractory glaucoma (neovascular, uveitic, other secondary glaucoma, and residual glaucoma), all of whom were treated with the AGV (model: FP7, New World Medical Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA) at Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital in China, from January 2016 to June 2023. The patient cohort was stratified into three distinct groups: neovascular glaucoma (NVG), secondary glaucoma (including uveitic, post-vitrectomy, traumatic, but excluding NVG), and residual glaucoma (with a history of anti-glaucoma surgery, the types of glaucoma before the surgery including primary open angle glaucoma, primary angle closure glaucoma and secondary glaucoma). The study included all patients clinically diagnosed with refractory glaucoma who underwent AGV implantation. Additional inclusion criteria included: absence of severe systemic or mental disorders, except for primary glaucoma (Fig.1).

All procedures were performed by the same experienced glaucoma surgeon (XXL). In all cases of NVG, anti-VEGF therapy was administered approximately one week before AGV implantation to reduce the occurrence of neovascularization. The AGV surgical process proceeded as outlined: (i) 2.5 mL of 2% lidocaine (Anhui Changjiang Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Wuhu, China) was administered for peribulbar anesthesia. (ii) A suspension wire was fashioned in the corneal limbus, and the bulbar conjunctiva superior to the temporal side was incised along the corneal limbus, resulting in the formation of a fornix-based conjunctival flap to reveal two rectus muscles. A pocket was created between the episclera and Tenon’s capsule using blunt dissection. Following the separation of the fascia, hemostasis was achieved with cauterization. A 4 × 4 mm scleral flap with a thickness of 50% was created superior to the temporal side. (iii) The valve tube was irrigated with a balanced saline solution to activate the valve mechanism. The Ahmed valve (model: FP7) was subsequently positioned between the lateral rectus and superior rectus muscles, with a 6 − 0 suture secured 10 mm posterior to the corneal limbus. (iv) A corneal stab incision at the temporal quadrant was performed, sodium hyaluronate was administered into the anterior chamber, and an anterior chamber puncture was executed at the corneal limbus beneath the scleral flap. The drainage tube was introduced into the anterior chamber via the puncture site. (v) The sclera flap was secured with 10 − 0 suture, the drainage tube was anchored and partially ligated with one stitch of 8 − 0 absorbable suture, and the conjunctival flap was sutured. The postoperative regimen involved Tobramycin and Dexamethasone eye drops four times daily for each group.

Similar to Mao et al. [15], the procedure was deemed a “complete success” if the IOP was ≤ 21 mmHg without the use of glaucoma medications or additional filtration surgery throughout the entire follow-up period. It was classified as a “qualified success”, if the IOP ≤ 21 mmHg was achieved with adjunctive medications, and was defined as a “failure” if the IOP exceeded 21 mmHg despite medication, if additional surgical intervention was required, if vision deteriorated to no light perception (NLP), or if phthisis bulbi developed. To establish a more rigorous definition of success, we introduced an additional criterion for complete success, requiring patients to demonstrate a reduction in IOP of at least 15% from baseline in addition to meeting the original criteria. Cases that did not fulfill this additional requirement were classified as qualified successes. The overall success included both complete success and qualified success.

Preoperative data were extracted from patient records and included age at surgery, gender, eye laterality, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), number of glaucoma medications, mean IOP over the three months preceding the surgery, history of prior ocular surgeries or laser interventions, specific glaucoma diagnosis and ocular history, and other co-morbidities.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 25.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Preoperative and postoperative data were compared using paired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests, while unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests were applied for independent continuous variables. Nonparametric variables were analyzed using Chi-square tests. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors influencing the surgical success rate.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Table1illustrates the baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study. The final analysis encompassed 199 eyes, with a distribution of 119 eyes from male patients and 80 eyes from female patients. Their mean age at the time of surgery was 55.06 ± 12.23 years, 42.23 ± 17.98 years, and 57.09 ± 12.06 years for the neovascular, secondary, and residual glaucoma groups respectively. The mean pre-operative IOP was 39.95 ± 11.93 mmHg, 33.95 ± 12.00 mmHg and 30.80 ± 9.84 mmHg among neovascular, secondary, and residual glaucoma, respectively. The difference between the mean baseline IOP and the IOP at each follow-up point was statistically significant (P< 0.05) (Fig.2). The mean change in VA between the pre-operative and post-operative groups at years 1 and 3 is shown in Fig.3. Statistically significant changes were observed in year 1 (P< 0.05), however, changes in VA at year 3 was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). The average number of glaucoma medications decreased from 3.25 ± 0.59 medications at baseline to 0.30 ± 0.65 at year 1, and 0.43 ± 0.74 at year 3. The difference between the mean baseline number of medications and the number at each follow-up point was statistically significant (P< 0.05) (Fig.4).

The complete success rates among all participants were 60.5% at year 1, and 56% at year 3. The overall success rates were 83% at year 1, and 74.7% at year 3. At year 1, the complete success rates for neovascular glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and residual glaucoma were 63.7%, 62.8%, and 59.3%, respectively. The overall success rates for these subgroups at year 1 were 86.4%, 86%, and 81.5% respectively (Table2).

Among the three glaucoma subgroups, NVG had the highest number of reported postoperative complications, with the most frequent being drainage tube exposure (6.7%), followed by choroidal detachment (3.7%) and drainage tube displacement (1.5%). No cases of malignant glaucoma were observed in this group. In the secondary glaucoma group, complications were less frequent, with drainage tube exposure being the only reported complication (9.1%). The residual glaucoma group showed a broader spectrum of complications, including malignant glaucoma, drainage tube displacement, and choroidal detachment, each occurring in 4.7% of cases. Notably, this group had no instances of drainage tube exposure. In the postoperative period, some patients required bleb needling. The rates of needling were 6.7% for the NVG group, 36.4% for the secondary glaucoma group and 44.2% for the residual glaucoma group. Overall, drainage tube-related complications were the most common across all groups, particularly in NVG, while malignant glaucoma occurred exclusively in the residual glaucoma group. The two malignant glaucoma patients primarily suffered from primary angle closure glaucoma. Within a week following AGV implantation, they experienced a disappearance of the anterior chamber and a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). As a result, vitrectomy was carried out to manage the onset of malignant glaucoma.

Table3presents the regression analysis of factors contributing to failure. Factors such as age, gender, diagnosis, preoperative VA, preoperative IOP, AGV combined with cataract surgery, history of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), history of vitrectomy, history of cataract surgery, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), and history of high blood pressure were included in the analysis. Logistic regression analysis ascertained the relative predictive ability of these factors. The findings suggested that preoperative IOP, and a history of PRP had a statistically-significant influence on the surgical success rate at 1-year follow-up.

Table4displays the regression analysis of factors influencing the surgical success rate at 1 year after surgery in NVG patients. Pre-operative IOP and a history of PRP were found to be statistically significant factors that affecting the surgical success rate at one-year follow-up in this subgroup.

The AGV has significantly improved the surgical treatment of refractory glaucoma, and this article analysed the long-term surgical success of the AGV implant in the Chinese population. Furthermore, preoperative factors contributing to the surgical success of the AGV and complications related to the procedure were explored. Similar to the current study, Xie, Z., et al. [16] reported a one-year surgical success rate of AGV of 66.7%. Lai, J. et al. [17] achieved a 73.8% success rate in operated eyes and Netland. et al. [18] reported a success rate of 73.1%. Our findings revealed an overall success rate of 83% at year 1, and 74.7% at year 3 of follow-up. The success rates for treatment declined over time. Failure rates progressively rose from 17% at year 1 to 25.3% at year 3. Subgroup analysis revealed similar trends across neovascular, secondary, and residual glaucoma at year 1, with complete success rates ranging from 59.3 to 63.7%, and overall success rates ranging from 81.5 to 86.4%.

In contrast to previous studies, the present research documented a higher success rate at the end of the year 1. We hypothesized that this discrepancy is due to the differences in the patient populations examined and the relatively larger sample size employed.

Consistent with the majority of retrospective studies evaluating treatment efficacy in refractory glaucoma, the present study did not include a control group, primarily due to the limited surgical options available. A meta-analysis has shown that the Baerveldt implant demonstrates a higher surgical success rate and greater reduction in glaucoma medication use compared to the AGV. Nonetheless, both implants exhibit comparable efficacy in lowering IOP and have similar adverse event profiles, indicating equivalent overall tolerability [19]. Qin et al. reported a one-year surgical success rate of 83.87% for microcatheter-assisted 360-degree trabeculotomy combined with trabeculectomy, which is consistent with the findings of the present study [20]. Collectively, these studies suggest that the AGV provides comparable efficacy to other surgical modalities in the management of refractory glaucoma.

In line with current research, previous studies have explored potential factors influencing the success rates of AGV implantation. Souza et al. conducted a long-term study involving 78 eyes to evaluate the outcomes of AGV implantation over an extended follow-up period [21]. Their study indicated an 80% success rate after one year and 49% after five years. They said prior glaucoma surgery increased the risk of failure. Postoperative fibrosis, characterized by the formation of a fibrous capsule around the endplate, is a significant challenge as it impedes aqueous flow. The progression of fibrosis around the plate is a leading cause of tube shunt failure. To mitigate this, the use of antifibrotic agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil, has been proposed to prevent encapsulation and improve the outcomes of AGV implantation. However, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of antifibrotics is mixed. For instance, Yazdani et al. (2016) observed no significant advantage in using MMC to prevent fibrosis and encapsulation in some cases [22]. These conflicting findings suggest that the role of antifibrotics in AGV implantation success is complex and may be influenced by various factors such as patient characteristics, surgical technique, and the underlying disease process [23,24]. Özalp, et al. conducted a retrospective study on 60 eyes in Turkey with AGV implantation, they found that higher mean preoperative IOP and younger age were risk factors for hypertensive phase development [25]. Xie et al.’s study in Chinese patients found that age, PRP, complications, and hyphema had an impact on surgical success [16]. Abe et al.’s findings from a tertiary hospital in Brazil, African American heritage, and an early hypertensive phase were associated with an elevated chance of failure [26]. Our findings align with several previous studies, indicating that higher preoperative IOP is a significant factor in the failure of the surgery.

Additionally, PRP emerged as a protective element against failure. PRP, by ablating the ischemic retina, effectively reduces tissue oxygen demand. This approach not only addresses the immediate neovascularization but also preemptively counters the risk of scar proliferation, which could compromise the long-term success of the AGV implantation. Therefore, integrating PRP as a critical component of the treatment regimen for NVG patients undergoing Ahmed valve surgery is essential for optimizing therapeutic efficacy and visual prognosis [16].

Following AGV surgery, patients may experience a range of postoperative complications, including hyphema, shallow anterior chamber, malignant glaucoma, choroidal detachment, exposure or displacement of the drainage valve. In contrast to our findings, Xie et al. reported a lower incidence of choroidal detachment, as well as a reduced occurrence of exposure or displacement of the drainage valve [16]. The variation in outcomes could be related to the surgical techniques and the characteristics of the patient populations studied. Choroidal detachment emerges as one of the most frequently encountered complications following AGV implantation. A retrospective case-control study conducted by Shin et al. suggested that the risk of choroidal detachment following AGV implantation is associated with the etiology of glaucoma, older age, pseudophakia (lens status), and hypertension in a Korean population [27]. Another study reported a significantly higher incidence of choroidal detachment, reaching 57.8% [28]. The discrepancy in incidence rates may be attributed to the poor vision of patients masking the symptoms of choroidal detachment. This highlights the importance of emphasizing postoperative B-ultrasound examinations in future studies to detect the occurrence of choroidal detachment.

In comparison to similar research, our study encountered several limitations. The study sample consisted of a greater number of male participants (male = 119 vs. Female = 80), which may have impacted its generalizability. Furthermore, the retrospective nature of the study presents several limitations, particularly with respect to potential biases arising from the extraction of non-standardized data from medical records. These include inconsistencies in IOP measurement techniques and VA recording methods. The absence of significant changes in VA at years 3 indicate stabilization of visual outcomes; however, this apparent stability may not accurately reflect true clinical stability and could be partially explained by a “floor effect”, particularly in neovascular glaucoma (NVG) patients with poor baseline VA. Additionally, the study did not include comparisons with other surgical interventions, which limits the ability to further substantiate the efficacy of AGV implantation. Finally, only 37.7% of eyes completed the 3-year follow-up, introducing attrition bias and potentially leading to an overestimation of long-term success rates. To obtain more accurate and generalizable outcomes, future studies should prioritize improved follow-up strategies and patient retention. Although the inclusion of a comparative group in the present study would have offered valuable context regarding the efficacy of the AGV, future research should aim to incorporate comparisons with alternative devices and treatment modalities.

AGV implantation is both successful and safe for the treatment of refractory glaucoma. Pre-operative IOP and a history of PRP were found to be statistically significant factors that influenced the surgical success rate at 1-year follow-up and decreased over 3-year follow-up. Despite the application of AGV implantation, the intermediate-term success rate remains modest, underscoring the need for close postoperative monitoring and proactive management of complications. Furthermore, ongoing research and development of more effective treatment modalities remain essential in the management of refractory glaucoma.
