KRASmutations drive pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. This study investigates molecular heterogeneity amongKRASsubtypes and their prognostic implications. This study exploresKRASmutations in PDAC, analyzing molecular heterogeneity and prognosis across our hospital cohort (SDFM,n= 113) with TCGA cohort (n= 183) and QCMG cohort (n= 383).KRAS,TP53,CDKN2A, andSMAD4were the main mutated genes. Co-mutations ofKRASwithTP53, andTP53withCDKN2A, correlated with higher tumor mutation burden and poorer outcomes.KRASsubtypes G12D and Q16&others had worse prognosis than G12V and G12R. CombiningTP53status withKRASsubtypes improved risk stratification: high-risk patients had shorter survival (P≤ 0.001), higher PD-L1 expression, P53 pathway alterations, fewer CD4+/CD8 + T cells and macrophages (p< 0.05), but more neutrophils (p< 0.001). These findings underscore the prognostic impact ofKRASandTP53mutations, guiding personalized treatment.

Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer, and the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths1. In Asia, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is increasing2. Pancreatic cancer is notorious for its high degree of malignancy. Due to the lack of distinctive clinical symptoms and early diagnostic tools, many patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease, leading to poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 10%3–5. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all types of pancreatic cancer. The advancement of molecular diagnostics has enabled researchers to gradually pinpoint targets for treating PDAC, includingKRAS6–8.

KRASmutations are the most prevalent genetic alterations in PDAC, occurring in approximately 90% of cases9,10. However, the specific molecular structure ofKRASresults in its low drug ability. Cancer-associated mutations inKRAScluster in one of three hotspots, with a majority (84%) of mutations causing single amino acid substitutions at G1211. Of the possible single-base missense mutations that can occur at G12, G12D is the most predominant (42%), followed by G12V. Currently, Adagrasib6,7and Sotorasib8can be used for targeted therapy in PDAC patients with theKRASG12C mutation. However, as G12C mutations are relatively low, this means that the majority of PDAC patients with G12D and G12V mutations face a lack of targeted therapies. In a recent cohort study from MDA, the overall positive rate ofKRASmutations was 82%, with the most common mutation beingKRASG12D (39%), followed byKRASG12V (31%),KRASG12R (14%),KRASQ61 (6%), and other rarerKRASvariants (9%)12. In terms of prognosis, patients withKRASG12D orKRASQ61 mutations have a lower survival rate compared toKRASwild-type patients, regardless of disease stage. The overall survival of patients withKRASG12R mutations is similar to that of wild-type patients. Other studies have also indicated that differentKRASmutations have varying impacts on prognosis13,14.

To characterize the mutational landscape of PDAC, we analyzed genomic profiles from three independent cohorts. Consistent with the known molecular architecture of PDAC9,KRASandTP53were the most commonly mutated genes across all datasets (SDFM, TCGA, QCMG), followed byCDKN2AandSMAD4(Fig.1A–C). Statistically significant co-occurrence was observed betweenKRASandTP53, as well as betweenTP53andCDKN2A(p< 0.05 in all cohorts; Fig.1A–C).

The mutation landscape and co-mutation patterns of the top 20 genes in pancreatic cancer patients were analyzed across three distinct cohorts: 113 patients from the SDFM cohort (A), 183 patients from the TCGA cohort (B), and 383 patients from the QCMG cohort (C); Additionally, in all three cohorts, PDAC patients with mutations inKRAS,TP53, andCDKN2Aexhibited significantly higher TMB values compared to those with wild-type alleles (P< 0.01), whereas no significant correlation was observed forSMAD4mutations (D–F).

Mutations inKRAS,TP53, andCDKN2Awere consistently associated with significantly elevated TMB compared to their respective wild-type groups across all cohorts (p< 0.05; Fig.1D–Fand TableS1), whereasSMAD4mutations were not significantly associated with TMB. Despite these associations, overall TMB levels remained low, with mean values ranging from 0.86 to 3.13 mutations per megabase (TableS1).

To investigate the impact ofKRAS,TP53,CDKN2A, andSMAD4mutations on prognosis, we conducted a univariate regression analysis of OS using the TCGA cohort data. The results are depicted in Fig.2A. Factors such as age,KRAS, andTP53mutations showed significant associations with overall survival (OS) (p< 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis (Fig.2B), onlyKRASmutation and age remained significant factors (p< 0.05). Detailed information on regression analysis is provided in TableS2. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed mutations inKRASandTP53were significantly associated with both poorer OS and progression-free survival (PFS) (p< 0.05) (Fig.2C, D). CombinedKRASandTP53mutations result in the worst survival outcomes (p< 0.05) (Fig.2E). However, no significant difference in OS or PFS between PDAC patients aged <65 and those aged ≥65 (Fig.S2).

AUnivariate Cox regression analysis identified Stage II (HR = 2.42,p= 0.026),KRASmutation (HR = 0.44,p< 0.001), andTP53mutation (HR = 0.59,p= 0.014) as significant factors for overall survival (OS);BMultivariate analysis highlighted age (HR = 1.026,p= 0.011) andKRASmutation (HR = 0.571,p= 0.028) as independent prognostic factors;C–EKaplan–Meier survival analyses demonstrated:KRASmutations are associated with worse outcomes in both OS (p= 0.00032) and PFS (p= 0.01);TP53mutations predict poorer survival compared to wild-type (OS:p= 0.013, PFS:p= 0.0056); combinedKRASandTP53mutations result in the worst survival outcomes (OS:p= 0.0023, PFS:p= 0.011) in TCGA cohort.

In our genetic mutation prognosis analysis, we further differentiatedKRASmutations. Figure3Ashows that theKRASG12D, G12V, and G12R mutations were predominant across all three cohorts, followed byKRASQ61 and other mutations. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses on the TCGA cohort withKRASmutations (Table1) revealed that the G12D, Q61, and other mutations were associated with a worse prognosis compared to the G12V mutation subgroup. Notably, the Q61 and other mutations were statistically significant (P< 0.05). However, analysis of clinical characteristics and driver gene mutations across the three cohorts (TablesS3–S5) showed no significant differences in age, gender, tumor stage,TP53,CDKN2A,SMAD4mutations, TMB, and MSI (Fig.S1). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that theKRASG12D, Q61, and other mutations had a worse prognosis, while G12R and G12V mutations had the highest median OS or PFS (Fig.3B). Further analysis ofTP53, CDKN2A, andSMAD4mutations withinKRASsubgroups showed no inter-group differences inTP53(Fig.3C),CDKN2A(Fig.S3A), orSMAD4(Fig.S4A). However,TP53mutations were significantly more prevalent in theKRASG12D and Q61&other mutation subgroups compared to otherKRASmutations (p< 0.05) across all three cohorts.

Prognostic analysis (Fig.S5) revealed thatTP53mutations do not significantly impact prognosis in cases withKRASG12D mutations. In contrast,KRASG12V mutation is associated with poorer prognosis inTP53-mutant patients, whileTP53wild-type patients show relatively better outcomes. Conversely, an opposite trend was observed inKRASG12R mutation cases. Further analysis ofKRASmutation subtypes inTP53-mutant patients demonstrated thatKRASG12R mutation is associated with significantly better prognosis compared to other subtypes (Fig.3D,P< 0.01). InTP53wild-type patients,KRASG12V mutation was linked to a relatively better prognosis (Fig.3E). Notably, patients with bothKRASG12R andTP53mutations showed survival outcomes similar to those with wild-typeKRAS, whileKRASG12V mutation inTP53wild-type patients (Fig.S6). Conversely, no clear patterns were observed in prognosis analyses based onCDKN2A(Fig.S3B–F) andSMAD4(Fig.S4B–F).

In light of these observations, we categorized PDAC patients into high- or low-risk cohorts based on theirKRASandTP53mutation status, as delineated below: Those withKRASG12D orKRASG12V mutations co-occurring withTP53mutations, as well as those withKRASG12R mutations co-occurring withTP53wild-type orKRASQ61 and other mutations, were designated as high-risk. Meanwhile, patients withKRASwild-type,KRASG12V mutations co-occurring withTP53wild-type, andKRASG12R mutations co-occurring withTP53mutations were classified as low-risk individuals. Based on this risk stratification, we conducted a prognostic analysis in TCGA and MSK cohorts. As illustrated in Figs.4AandS7, high-risk PDAC patients demonstrated significantly shorter median OS, PFS, DFS (disease free survival), and DSS (disease free survival) compared to low-risk patients in TCGA cohort (p≤ 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis further identified high-risk status as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (Fig.4B). The prognostic analysis of the MSK cohort further validated that risk stratification based onKRASmutation status is a reliable predictor of outcomes in PDAC patients (Fig.S8).

To understand the potential mechanisms underlying these prognostic differences, we conducted a gene differential analysis. As depicted in the heatmap (Fig.4C), the gene expression profiles of high-risk patients show obvious differences compared to low-risk patients. Specifically, high-risk patients exhibit a marked upregulation of genes compared to low-risk patients (232 vs 26, Fig.4D). As shown in Fig.4E, GO enrichment analysis revealed that, in terms of Biological Processes, genes upregulated in high-risk patients were significantly enriched in pathways related to epidermis development, skin development, cornification, epidermal cell differentiation, and keratinization. Regarding Cellular Components, highly enriched categories included the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, anchored components of the membrane, membrane components, intermediate filaments, and lipid droplets. For Molecular Functions, the upregulated genes were predominantly associated with retinol dehydrogenase activity, signal receptor ligand activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and extracellular matrix structural constituents. Furthermore, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (Fig.4F) identified significant enrichment in key signaling pathways, including retinol metabolism, estrogen signaling, and PPAR signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that the gene expression profile of high-risk patients is marked by the activation of pathways related to epidermal development, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction.

To further investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted a differential mutation analysis of oncogenic signaling pathways. In the SDFM cohort, high-risk patients exhibited a higherTP53pathway mutation rate (96.2% vs. 67.86%,p< 0.001) (Fig.5Aand TableS6). In the TCGA cohort, high-risk patients showed higher mutation rates inTP53(96.2% vs. 67.86%,p< 0.001), Cell Cycle (34.07% vs. 5.95%,p< 0.001), TGF-Beta (32.97% vs. 19.05%,p< 0.05), and Hippo (29.67% vs. 16.67%,p< 0.05) signaling pathways (Fig.5Band TableS6). In the QCMG cohort, high-risk patients exhibited higher mutation rates inTP53(76.23% vs. 51.28%,p< 0.001) and WNT (21.13% vs. 8.55%,p< 0.01) signaling pathways (Fig.5Cand TableS6). The corresponding pathway mutation profiles are shown in Fig.5D–F. The three cohorts exhibited significant differences in theTP53pathway, consistent with the analysis of clinical characteristics and driver mutation status between high-risk and low-risk groups (TablesS7–S9).

Exploratory analyses with FDR-adjustedp-values in Supplementary TableS6, see “Methods” for analysis definitions;D–FHeatmaps showing the mutation profiles of pathway-related genes for high-risk and low-risk groups in the three cohorts.

We further analyzed the association between mutations inKRAS,TP53,CDKN2A, andSMAD4 with PD-L1 expression levels. When setting the threshold of PD-L1 expression using TPS at 1%, a significantly higher proportion of PD-L1 positivity was observed in patients with PDAC harboringKRASorTP53mutations compared to wild-type cases, with the increase being particularly pronounced inTP53-mutated patients (P< 0.05) (Fig.6A, B). Similarly, a higher proportion of PD-L1 positive cases was noted in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig.6C). When the TPS threshold was gradually increased to 5% and 10%, a similar distribution trend in PD-L1 expression was consistently observed (Fig.S9). Notably, the trend appeared more prominent at the 5% threshold, suggesting a degree of stability in the observed association (TableS10). However, when the threshold was further increased to 50%, these differences in distribution became less evident (TableS10). In contrast, mutations inCDKN2AandSMAD4showed no significant impact on PD-L1 expression across all threshold settings (1%, 5%, or 10%) (Fig.S9). Moreover, we found no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and TMB levels (Fig.6Dand TableS10).

Exploratory analyses with FDR-adjustedp-values in Supplementary TableS11, see “Methods” for analysis definitions.

Through the analysis of TCGA transcriptome data, it was found that the mRNA expression level ofCD274was higher in high-risk patients compared to the low-risk group, while the mRNA expression levels ofCTLA4andPDCD1were lower, although the differences were not statistically significant (Fig.6E). However, we found the expression levels of CD3(composed of CD3D, CD3E, and CD3G subunits) and CD8 (composed of CD8A and CD8B subunits) were markedly elevated in the low-risk group relative to the high-risk group (Fig.S10). The ESTIMATE immune scoring analysis showed that the immune scores (including StromalScore, ImmuneScore, and ESTIMATEScore) of high-risk patients were significantly lower than those of the low-risk group (P< 0.05) (Fig.6Fand TableS11). Further analysis of immune infiltration levels between the two groups using TIMER (Fig.6G) and QUANTISEQ (Fig.6H) revealed that the infiltration levels of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells were significantly lower in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (P< 0.05) (TableS11). However, QUANTISEQ analysis also found that the infiltration levels of Tregs and M2 macrophages were significantly lower in the high-risk group (P< 0.05), while the infiltration levels of M1 macrophages and neutrophils were significantly higher than those in the low-risk group (P< 0.05) (TableS11).

KRASmutations are a key event in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis ofKRASmutations and their subtypes in the SDFM cohort, and performed parallel validation in the TCGA and QCMG cohorts. Consistent with previous studies12, we identifiedKRAS,TP53,SMAD4, andCDKN2Amutations as the most common driver mutations in PDAC across all three cohorts. Additionally,KRASmutations frequently co-occur withTP53mutations, which in turn often co-occur withCDKN2Amutations. Prognostic analyses have shown thatKRASmutations andTP53mutations are associated with poorer prognosis, which is consistent with earlier research on PDAC15,16. A preclinical study suggested thatKRASandTP53mutations synergistically promote PDAC growth and metastasis through interactions with CREB117, potentially explaining the poor prognosis associated with these mutations. Additionally,KRAS,TP53, andCDKN2Amutations correlate with higher TMB, which is considered a key factor in generating immune neoantigens18. However, despite this correlation, TMB did not show a significant link to PDAC prognosis in this study. Most patients had TMB values below the clinical threshold for TMB-H (10 mutations/Mb), indicating that the role of TMB and these mutations in prognosis and treatment warrants further exploration.

Our study found that the proportion ofKRASwild-type mutations is approximately 10%, and the prognosis is better than that ofKRASmutant types, which is consistent with previous research19. The analysis ofKRASmutation subtypes in PDAC patients aligns with previous studies11,12, showingKRASG12D, G12V, and G12R as the most common, followed by Q61 and other rare mutations. Among them, G12D, Q61, and other mutations are linked to shorter PFS and OS, while G12V and G12R mutations are associated with better prognosis. This finding is consistent with the research conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center12,20. The prognosis differences among G12D, Q61, G12V, and G12R mutations may stem from their distinct effects on KRAS protein function and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The G12D/Q61 mutations may enhance RAF/MEK/ERK signaling21or create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment22,23, promoting tumor proliferation, survival, and invasion. Spatial profiling reveals revealed elevated oncogenic signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in G12D tumors, whereas G12R tumors exhibited increased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling20.

Given the high prevalence ofTP53mutations across allKRASsubtypes, with mutation rates exceeding 60%, particularly in the G12D, Q61, and other mutant subtypes, we further explored the relationship between specificKRASmutations andTP53alterations. Our analysis reveals, for the first time, thatTP53mutation status may impact the prognosis of patients with certainKRASmutation subtypes. As previously reported24, theKRASG12D mutation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, both independently and in combination withTP53mutations. In contrast, forKRASG12V subtype, those with theTP53wild-type tend to have a longer survival than those withTP53mutations.TP53mutations are linked to worse OS in various cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)20, likely due toTP53’s critical role in tumor suppression and DNA repair. Mutations inTP53lead to uncontrolled cell cycle progression and accumulation of DNA damage, exacerbating tumor malignancy. Research by Zou et al. suggests thatKRASG12D andTP53co-mutation patients exhibit a low Th1/Th2 ratio and an immunosuppressive microenvironment (high Treg, high ratio of Treg to tumor-specific CD4 + T cell), whileKRASG12V andTP53wild-type patients show a more inflammatory microenvironment and significant survival improvement following adjuvant chemotherapy25. Based onKRASmutation subtypes andTP53mutation status, PDAC patients are categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups. The low-risk group, including some patients with specificKRASG12V and G12R mutations, exhibits significantly better prognosis, as confirmed in the large-scale MSK PDAC cohort10. Pathway enrichment analysis reveals that mutations in high-risk patients are primarily concentrated in TP53 and cell cycle-related pathways, with a particularly high co-occurrence rate ofKRASandTP53mutations. Previous studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect betweenKRASandTP53mutations in the development and metastasis of pancreatic cancer17,26.TP53mutations cause abnormal exon retention, upregulating hnRNPK, which promotes GAP17 membrane localization and sustains Ras signaling, driving tumorigenesis27. These findings underscore the importance of consideringTP53mutation status when treating KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer, underscoring the need for risk stratification.

IHC analysis of PD-L1 protein expression is a critical biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response. Studies consistently show that high PD-L1 expression in PDAC is associated with a poorer prognosis28–30. Notably, patients exhibiting PD-L1 expression levels of ≥10%, as assessed using the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody SP142, demonstrated significantly reduced disease-specific survival, as reported by Tessier-Cloutier et al.30Our findings further demonstrate that PD-L1 positivity is more frequently observed in PDAC patients carryingKRASorTP53mutations, particularly those withTP53mutations, and classified in the high-risk group. Notably, the most pronounced difference in PD-L1 expression distribution was observed when a TPS threshold of 5% was applied. These results suggest that PD-L1 positivity or upregulation may contribute to the poor prognosis observed in these patients; however, further data are required to substantiate this association. In immune infiltration analysis, low-risk patients show higher levels of CD4/CD8 T cells and Treg cells, which correlate with better prognosis across various cancers31,32. CD4 + T cells activate CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, playing a vital role in anti-tumor immunity33,34. However, in high-risk PDAC patients, reduced CD4 + T cell infiltration weakens CD8 + T cell function, diminishing anti-tumor responses and worsening prognosis. We also observed higher neutrophil infiltration in high-risk PDAC patients, which has been linked to increased malignancy and poorer prognosis35.KRASandTP53mutations, common in high-risk PDAC, are associated with a higher density of immunosuppressive myeloid cells like MDSCs and Tregs, which inhibit CD4 + Th1 and CD8 + T cell activity, creating an immune-tolerant microenvironment36.TP53mutations increase CD8 + T cell density, but this effect is influenced by other mutations37.KRASmutations, in particular, enhance Treg conversion and suppress CD8 + T cell anti-tumor activity38,39. Furthermore,KRASmutations elevate PD-L1 expression, contributing to immune suppression and tumor progression40,41. Interestingly, tumors with bothKRASandTP53mutations exhibit higher PD-L1 levels, which have been associated with better immunotherapy outcomes42,43, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic mutations and immune responses in PDAC prognosis.

This study has several limitations. First, although PDAC patients were included, the sample size was small, and detailed pathological staging data were unavailable. To mitigate this, two external PDAC cohorts were analyzed. However, some cohorts lacked complete clinical and prognostic data, with notable imbalances in pathological stage distribution. Future studies should focus on larger, well-characterized cohorts with balanced clinical profiles for validation. Additionally, the unmeasured treatment modality and performance status may affect the clinical generalizability of the risk stratification. Future prospective studies should incorporate these factors to refine the prognostic model. Second, this study’s SDFM cohort utilized a 639-gene panel to detect mutations and calculate TMB, rather than WES, which might have some impact on the mutation profile and TMB calculation, although the results are quite similar to those of TCGA and QCMG. Also, our study primarily focuses on molecular subtyping based on mutational profiles, without in-depth analysis of transcriptomic or proteomic data. Due to practical constraints, key transcriptional features of pancreatic cancer subtypes, such as the classical and basal-like types, were not included. Third, although we conducted prognostic validation using large-scale cohorts, we did not account for the impact of postoperative adjuvant therapy or systemic treatment, which may significantly influence survival outcomes. The absence of treatment factors could limit the generalizability of our findings. Therefore, future studies should incorporate these treatment variables into the analysis to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their potential effects on prognosis. Lastly, the results of the mechanistic analysis are based solely on the characteristics of the study cohort and require further validation. Therefore, future studies should validate these observations in larger cohorts and explore the functional significance of the identified molecular changes, with the aim of providing a more robust scientific foundation for the management and prognosis improvement of pancreatic cancer patients.

In conclusion, the aforementioned findings provide a comprehensive analysis of the complex molecular landscape of pancreatic cancer, with a particular focus on the critical roles of differentKRASmutation subtypes andTP53mutations in patient prognosis. The risk stratification and immune infiltration analysis based on these findings could offer significant insights for personalized treatment strategies in PDAC, helping to identify patient subgroups that may benefit from targeted or immunotherapy treatments.

This study included 113 patients diagnosed with PDAC, confirmed through pathological evaluation, and enrolled between June 2021 and December 2023 at Shandong Cancer Hospital, constituting the SDFM cohort. To minimize potential confounders and ensure data accuracy, patients who had previously received anti-RAS inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were excluded, as these treatments could alter the tumor microenvironment and mutation profiles. Additionally, inclusion was limited to patients with both tumor tissue and paired blood samples available for genetic analysis. Tumor tissue specimens, obtained via surgical resection or biopsy, were required to contain at least 20% tumor cells to ensure the reliability of genetic testing. Rigorous exclusion criteria were applied to maintain the integrity of the study. Patients without a confirmed PDAC diagnosis, those lacking either tumor tissue or paired blood samples, or those with tumor samples containing less than 20% tumor cells, were excluded to guarantee that the genetic analyses were based on high-quality, representative tumor specimens. Clinical data, including patient age and gender, were retrieved from medical records. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board of Shandong Cancer Hospital (SDTHEC2023011024) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Tumor DNA and peripheral blood genomic DNA were extracted using commercial kits from YunYing (Shanghai, China), specifically the Human Tissue DNA Extraction Kit and the Human Blood Genomic DNA Extraction Kit, respectively, following the manufacturer’s protocols. DNA was eluted in the provided elution buffer, and its concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. All DNA samples were stored at −20 °C until further processing.

Library preparation was carried out using the VAHTS Universal DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Targeted enrichment was performed using proprietary probes optimized by Shanghai YunYing, which cover the exonic regions and selected intronic sequences of 639 cancer-associated genes (see TableS12for full gene list)44. Sequencing was conducted on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform using standard protocols.

FastQC software (version 0.11.2) and customized Python script were used to screen FASTQ files, with the adaptor sequences and sequences with Q below 30 removed. Clean reads were mapped to the reference human genome GRCh37/hg19 using BWA (Burrows Wheeler Aligner version 0.7.7). BAM files were then realigned and recalled using GATK3.545, which was also used to detect mutations. Duplicate sequences were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates (version 1.35) to reduce any potential polymerase chain reaction bias. VarScan (version 2.3.2)46was used to select single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) satisfying the following criteria: depth ≥ 100, reads ≥ 10, and allele frequency ≥ 5% (if hotspot, ≥ 1%). Pindel (version 0.2.5b8)47was used for insertion or deletion (indel) detection using default parameters, with at least 5 unique reads.

Compared with matched normal samples, somatic SNVs and InDels of tumors were named and functionally annotated using MuTect v. 1.1.4 and Varscan2 v. 2.3.9 software. Mutations with a variant allele frequency of ≥5% were defined as high-confidence mutations (≥1% for hotspots). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated using the number of all somatic, coding, base substitution, and indel mutations per megabase, including synonymous mutations. The total number of mutations counted was divided by the size of the coding region of the targeted territory (1.36 Mb of the coding genome) to calculate the TMB per megabase. Microsatellite instability (MSI) scores of all samples were calculated using MSIsensor48with default parameters, a software tool for quantifying MSI in genome sequencing data using tumor-only or paired tumor-normal samples. We used 29 microsatellite sites as input files for MSI detection of tumor-only patterns. The MSI score was defined as the percentage of unstable microsatellites among all microsatellites used. Each microsatellite site had at least 20 spanning reads and single-nucleotide mutations.

The PD-L1 expression level for each patient was determined using the Dako 22C3 pharmDx system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) assay, and the results are presented as a tumor proportion score (TPS)49.

This study utilized two external validation groups for comparative analysis with the SDFM cohort: 184 PDAC patients from the TCGA cohort and 383 PDAC patients from the QCMG cohort, all of which have comprehensive genetic mutation data. These cohorts served as parallel groups for comparative analysis within the SDFM cohort (detailed clinical information see in TableS13). The data were sourced from the publicly available cBioPortal database (https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets). Among them, 116KRAS-mutant patients from the TCGA cohort were analyzed for survival outcomes across different groups. Additionally, a large validation cohort (MSK cohort, comprising 2270 patients with survival data) was used to validate subsequent risk stratification10. We used the survfit function from the R package “survival” to analyze the differences in prognosis between different groups of samples. We then assessed the difference in gene expression between the groups using the limma method in the Sangerbox platform50–52(http://www.sangerbox.com/tool, a free online platform for comprehensive data analysis).

The prevalence and distribution of genomic alterations were visualized using the R package “maftools”53. The “IOBR” package is used for immune infiltration analysis54. The R package “ggplot2” was used to draw the boxplots. The nonparametric Wilcox test was subsequently used to test for the significance of the difference in means between the two populations. For exploratory post hoc comparisons, multiple testing adjustments were performed using the FDR to control the false discovery rate.
