In the context of the global energy transition, the efficient extraction of lithium resources has become a critical link in the new energy industry chain. Addressing challenges such as poor selectivity, low adsorption capacity, and environmental concerns in extracting lithium from salt lake brines, this study developed a novel aluminum-based adsorbent/zeolite molecular sieve composite adsorbent (LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5). The material was constructed with a hierarchical porous structure through seed-assisted synthesis of the ZSM-5 molecular sieve carrier, followed byin situhydrothermal growth of lithium-aluminum layered double hydroxide (LiAl-LDHs). Systematic characterizationviaXRD, FT-IR, and SEM confirmed its crystal structure, functional group distribution, and micro-morphology. Single-factor experiments optimized key parameters (ZSM-5 : LiAl-LDHs = 1 : 2) and adsorption conditions (pH = 7,T= 25 °C,C= 10 g L−1). Kinetic analysis revealed that the adsorption conformed to the pseudo-second-order model, indicating chemisorption-dominated mechanisms. The composite demonstrated high selectivity (αLi Mg = 188.13) and recyclability in authentic salt lake brine, offering an environmentally friendly solution for exploiting high Mg2+/Li+ratio resources.

A novel lithium extraction composite adsorbent was prepared by loading aluminum salt adsorbent onto molecular sieve LiAl-LDHS/ZSM-5 for the first time.

Lithium compounds are extensively utilized in ceramics, nuclear materials, glass manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and battery production industries.1–3The rapid expansion of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage has substantially increased lithium demand for batteries.4–6Compared to ore-based extraction (e.g., spodumene), lithium recovery from salt lake brines reduces costs by 30–50% while offering environmental advantages.7However, both brine and seawater systems contain coexisting ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), where efficient Li+/Mg2+separation remains challenging due to their similar crystal ionic radii (Li+: 0.076 nm; Mg2+: 0.072 nm).8Globally, major lithium-rich salt lakes are distributed in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, the United States, and China. While brine resources in the first four countries typically exhibit Mg2+/Li+mass ratios <8.0,9Chinese salt lakes—despite harboring >85% of domestic lithium reserves—face inherent challenges of ultrahigh Mg2+/Li+ratios (>40).10Current domestic lithium production fails to meet escalating strategic demands, necessitating breakthroughs in cost-effective extraction technologies for high-Mg2+/Li+ratio brines to achieve resource self-sufficiency.

In recent years, adsorption has emerged as a pivotal approach for lithium extraction from low-grade brines due to its environmental and economic merits, with high-performance adsorbent development being central to this technology. Manganese-based ion sieves (such as LiMn2O4) exhibit superior selectivity but suffer from structural instability, where acid treatment triggers manganese dissolution.26,27Although doping,28,29nano structuring,30or electrochemical assistance31,32can mitigate these issues, industrial deployment remains constrained. Titanium-based adsorbents (e.g., lithium titanate, LTO) demonstrate exceptional cycling stability, with Lawagonet al.8reporting Li+/Mg2+separation factors up to 333.2, while the production cost of LTO is expensive. Fe-doped LTO developed by Wanget al.33achieves high capacity but suffers from poor permeability in powder form, necessitating porous granulation34or nanotube synthesis35for engineering applicability. Aluminum salt adsorbents (LiAl-LDHs) enable Li+-specific capturevialayered vacancy structures, where the “memory effect” and “steric hindrance effect” confer ultrahigh Mg2+/Li+selectivity.36,37Magnetic modification further enhances separation performance.38However, the practical adsorption capacity of LiAl-LDHs was consistently lower than the theoretical capacity.39Therefore, improvement in the Li adsorption capacity of LiAl-LDH has become a challenge to foster further progress of the Li extraction industry. Early resin-supported versions incur high costs, while directly synthesized variants show limited capacity, demanding synergistic enhancement with molecular sieves. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with high Si/Al ratios, large surface areas, and shape-selective catalysis are well-established in catalytic cracking40and alkylation.41Recent studies extend their utility to environmental adsorption, where Zuoet al.42demonstrated that high-silica ZSM-5 (HSZSM-5) efficiently removes sulfonamide antibioticsvialiquid-film diffusion mechanisms, highlighting its potential as an adsorbent carrier. Silvaet al.43successfully loaded biomass materials onto ZSM-5 molecular sieves and applied the resulting composite to Cr(vi) adsorption. Experimental results demonstrated the exceptional ion-exchange capacity of this composite, unequivocally validating the feasibility of such hybrid materials for metal ion adsorption applications. The hydrothermalin situloading of aluminum-based adsorbents onto seed-assisted ZSM-5 carriers offers a notable advancement in lithium extraction from high Mg2+/Li+ratio brines. This composite design leverages the structural and chemical synergy between LiAl-LDHs and ZSM-5. The high surface area and abundant silanol groups of ZSM-5 enhance the dispersion and accessibility of active sites. Its rigid framework provides structural support, mitigating layer collapse of LiAl-LDHs through a nano-confinement effect. Moreover, the interconnected pore channels of ZSM-5 facilitate rapid lithium-ion transport while complementing the ion-selective adsorption of LiAl-LDHs, together improving separation efficiency and material permeability. This strategy effectively addresses the stability and diffusion limitations of conventional LiAl-LDHs adsorbents.

Addressing ecological fragility and compositional complexity in lithium extraction from western China's salt lakes, this work pioneers an innovative strategy of integrating aluminum salt adsorbents (LiAl-LDHs) with ZSM-5 molecular sieves. Throughin situhydrothermal loading of LiAl-LDHs onto seed-assisted synthesized ZSM-5 carriers, we constructed a novel LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 composite adsorbent designed to overcome the traditional capacity limitations of aluminum salts and enhance permeability. Systematic optimization of ZSM-5/LiAl-LDHs mass ratios and adsorption parameters (time, temperature, pH, and solid–liquid ratio) was conducted. Material formation mechanisms were elucidatedviaXRD crystallography, FT-IR functional group analysis, and SEM morphological characterization. The composite demonstrated exceptional cyclic stability and ion selectivity (particularly Li+/Mg2+separation efficiency) in authentic salt lake brines. Adsorption kinetics modeling further revealed mass transfer mechanisms. This study provides a new paradigm for developing high-capacity, readily regenerable, and environmentally benign adsorbents, enabling sustainable exploitation of high-Mg2+/Li+ratio brine resources.

Manganese carbonate (MnCO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory (China). Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) and sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) were purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Chemical Reagent Factory (China). Lithium nitrate (LiNO3), urea (CH4N2O), ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, (C2H5O)4Si), anhydrous ethanol (EtOH, C2H5OH), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, C12H29NO), and silica sol (SiO2·nH2O) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd (China). Salt-lake brine samples were collected from Baqiancuo salt-lake (Tibet, China). The composition of the salt-lake brine used in the experiment is shown inTable 1.

Nano-silicalite-1 seeds were hydrothermally crystallized (120 °C, 48 h) from a gel (molar ratio SiO2: TPAOH : EtOH : H2O : Na2O = 2 : 0.5 : 8 : 20 : 0.05) prepared by sequential addition of TEOS (41.66 g) and ethanol (36.85 g), NaOH (0.4 g), H2O (36 g), and dropwise TPAOH (10.16 g) under 24 h stirring. The product was quenched, centrifuged, washed, dried (80 °C, 12 h), and pulverized.

ZSM-5 was synthesizedviastaged hydrothermal crystallization from a gel (Na2O : SiO2: Al2O3: H2O = 10.3 : 100 : 1.25 : 2500). NaOH (0.76 g) and Al2O3(0.43 g) dissolved in H2O (42.86 g) were mixed with silica sol (15.94 g, 5 h stirring), then seeded with 0.6 wt% silicalite-1 (1 h stirring). The solid was quenched, centrifuged, washed, dried (80 °C, 12 h), and pulverized.

LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 was prepared by dissolving Al(NO3)3·9H2O and LiNO3(Al : Li = 2) in H2O, adding urea (urea : metal ions = 3) and ZSM-5 (zeolite : Li+= specified ratio), homogenizing (1 h), and hydrothermally treating (120 °C, 24 h). The composite was washed, dried (80 °C), and pulverized. The synthesis protocol is schematically illustrated inFig. 1.

Material characterization was performed as follows: X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis employed Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 25 mA) with a 2θrange of 5–80°at a 4°min−1scan rate to determine the phase composition of both pristine and modified aluminum salt adsorbents. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy identified functional groups and bonding configurations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed morphological features and surface architectures. Lithium ion concentrations before/after adsorption were quantified using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), with measurements conducted in triplicate.

Adsorption kinetics employs mathematical models to describe dynamic evolution toward equilibrium under multifactorial influences. Given the inherent complexities—including adsorbent heterogeneity, diverse target ions, variable media composition, and environmental fluctuations (such as ambient and elevated temperatures)—single-theory approaches prove insufficient for comprehensive analysis. In solid–liquid systems, adsorption rates are typically modeled using three primary equations: the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Weber–Morris (W–M) kinetic models.

Comparative SEM analysis of LiAl-LDHs and ZSM-5 elucidates their structural characteristics and synergistic functionality in lithium extraction from salt lakes.Fig. 2areveals uniformly distributed ZSM-5 particles (1–3 μm) exhibiting smooth surfaces, regular hexagonal morphology, and predominant pupa-like crystalline structures.Fig. 2bdemonstrates well-dispersed LiAl-LDHs spheres (200–500 nm) composed of distinctly stacked nanolayers with structural integrity. The composite morphology inFig. 2cconfirms successful LiAl-LDHs loading onto ZSM-5, transforming originally smooth zeolite surfaces into coarse textures with granular deposits. High-magnification imaging (Fig. 2d) resolves these surface features as densely packed layered structures characteristic of LiAl-LDHs, verifying effective heterostructure formation. This nano-architectural integration provides additional active sites, enhancing metal ion capture efficiency from brines compared to individual components. The synergistic adsorption mechanism elevates lithium recovery rates, positioning LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 as a promising adsorbent for industrial brine processing.

Fig. 3bconfirms successful synthesis of nano-silicalite-1 seeds, with distinct XRD reflections at 2θ= 7.8°, 8.8°, 23.2°, 23.8°, and 24.3°matching the standard MFI topology. Persistent high-intensity peaks at 2θ= 7.9 ± 0.1°, 8.8 ± 0.1°, 23.1 ± 0.1°, 23.8 ± 0.1°, and 24.3 ± 0.1°further validate the high crystallinity and phase-pure MFI structure of the synthesized ZSM-5 molecular sieve.45As evidenced inFig. 3c, the hydrothermal-derived aluminum salt adsorbent exhibits XRD patterns identical to LiAl2(OH)7·xH2O, confirming its dominant component as lithium–aluminum layered hydroxide.46Fig. 3dreveals preserved MFI topology in the composite through characteristic reflections at 2θ= 7.9 ± 0.1°, 8.8 ± 0.1°, 23.1 ± 0.1°, 23.8 ± 0.1°, and 24.3 ± 0.1°, while LiAl2(OH)7·xH2O signatures from LiAl-LDHs remain detectable. Notable intensity attenuation of ZSM-5 peaks, coupled with minimal peak shifts (<0.2°), demonstrates effective LiAl-LDHs loading without compromising the zeolitic framework integrity, confirming successful composite formation.

The mass ratio of composite components critically governs adsorption performance. As depicted inFig. 4a, adsorption capacity follows a bell-shaped curve with increasing ZSM-5 content: initial enhancement transitions to decline beyond an optimal threshold. This trend originates from competing mechanisms—moderate ZSM-5 incorporation facilitates effective LiAl-LDHs loading, whereas excess ZSM-5 (>1 : 2 ratio) induces active site dilution and structural heterogeneity. Consequently, the LiAl-LDHs : ZSM-5 mass ratio of 1 : 2 delivers peak performance with a calculated capacity of 4.00 mg g−1.

Fig. 4breveals rapid exponential growth in adsorption capacity during the initial 240 min for LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5, attributable to abundant vacant sites facilitating unrestricted Li+intercalation. Subsequent plateau formation beyond 240 min indicates restricted adsorption kinetics due to structural reorganization and pore narrowing caused by accumulated Li+. Equilibrium was achieved after 12 h, yielding an optimal adsorption capacity of 6.06 mg g−1. This represents a discernible enhancement over coprecipitation-synthesized aluminum salt adsorbents and pristine LiAl-LDHs, demonstrating the composite's structural superiority.

Fig. 4cindicates that temperature exerts a less pronounced influence on LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 adsorption compared to other factors. While thermal effects are observable, they are not decisive for adsorption performance. Considering industrial cost-efficiency and energy-saving benefits, the optimal adsorption temperature was selected as 25 °C (ambient conditions), yielding a calculated capacity of 4.00 mg g−1.

Fig. 4dindicates enhanced adsorption performance of LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 in weakly alkaline environments (pH = 3–11), with deviations from pH 7 significantly reducing efficiency due to competing reactions governed byeqn (9)and(10).

Consequently, the optimal adsorption pH is determined as 7.0, yielding a calculated capacity of 6.05 mg g−1.

Fig. 4edemonstrates an inverse correlation between the solid-to-liquid ratio and adsorption capacity of LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5: higher ratios correspond to reduced Li+uptake. This phenomenon arises from constant Li+concentration in solution, consistent with heterogeneous adsorption mechanisms observed in coprecipitation- and hydrothermally-synthesized adsorbents. Consequently, the optimal adsorbent concentration is determined as 10 g L−1, yielding a calculated adsorption capacity of 4.71 mg g−1.

As demonstrated inFig. 4f, comparative adsorption experiments under optimized conditions reveal enhanced Li+uptake capacity in LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5versuspristine LiAl-LDHs. This performance elevation confirms that composite formation not only preserves but significantly amplifies adsorption functionality, successfully achieving the modification objectives. The results establish LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 as a promising candidate for industrial lithium extraction applications.

As evidenced inFig. 5a, the LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 composite achieved a high Li+desorption efficiency of 60.4% under optimal conditions using water elution, demonstrating favorable regeneration performance. Over five consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles, the composite maintained 91.9% of its initial adsorption capacity (Q1= 6.42 mg g−1), withQ5declining to 5.90 mg g−1. This marginal efficiency reduction (8.1% loss) is attributed to partial active site degradation during cyclic operations. Strategic approaches—such as periodic regeneration or structural modifications—are recommended to enhance long-term stability for practical deployment. The adsorption–desorption principle of aluminum-based adsorbent was given byeqn (11). It can be seen that the adsorption–desorption of aluminum salt adsorbent is a reversible process, which has the characteristics of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. The regeneration of aluminum salt adsorbent can be realized by washing.47This reflects its economic and environmental advantages, as the utilization of water as a desorbent not only reduces costs but also minimizes ecological impact, thereby facilitating industrial cycle sustainability.

Lithium extraction from salt lake brines offers the advantages of operational simplicity and low cost. However, the similar chemical properties of Li+and Mg2+pose tough challenges for economically efficient lithium recovery from brines with high Mg2+/Li+mass ratios. As shown inFig. 5b, LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 exhibits markedly superior adsorption capacity for Li+over competing ions in authentic brine systems, demonstrating exceptional selectivity. The experimentally obtained parameters are presented inTable 2. As can be observed, the distribution coefficient (Kd) of Li+is significantly higher than those of other metal ions, indicating the superior selectivity of the adsorbent toward Li+. Moreover, the competition factor (CF) of Li+was significantly higher than that of competing ions, indicating that GEL-LMO exhibits strong resistance to interference from other ions during lithium-ion adsorption. The selectivity order of LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 for each ion follows Li+≫ Mg2+> Na+> K+> Ca2+> B3+.This phenomenon can be explained by the adsorption mechanism of LiAl-LDHs: Li+ions can enter the solid phase and bind to structural vacancies in LiAl-LDHs, while other impurity ions remain in the liquid phase. LiAl-LDHs is a unique layered material composed of monovalent Li+and trivalent Al3+ions. Li+ions are embedded in the lattice vacancies within the octahedral framework of Al(OH)3, generating a positively charged structure.48Furthermore, due to weak binding affinity on the adsorbent surface, impurities exhibit minimal interference with adsorption efficacy. Consequently, LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 demonstrates promising potential for lithium extraction from salt lakes.

Kinetic analysis of the adsorption process for the LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 composite was performed. The kinetic model curves and corresponding parameters are presented inFig. 6andTable 3. As evident fromFig. 6a, the time required to reach adsorption equilibrium increases while the equilibrium adsorption capacity decreases with increasing initial adsorption capacity. The kinetic characteristics are consistent with the conclusions from the previous single-factor experiments. As observed inFig. 6b and c, the pseudo-second-order model exhibits superior fitting performance compared to the pseudo-first-order model for LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5, with the calculated adsorption capacity closely matching experimental values. This confirms that the adsorption process follows pseudo-second-order kinetics.Fig. 6dreveals that the W–M curve for Li+adsorption does not pass through the origin, indicating a two-stage adsorption mechanism. The initial steep-slope section reflects rapid adsorption dominated by surface diffusion, where abundant active sites lead to high adsorption rates. Subsequently, the plateau section demonstrates slowed adsorption due to site saturation, suggesting intra-particle diffusion contributes to the process but is not the sole rate-limiting step.

Based on the aforementioned research, this study designed a lithium extraction process (as shown inFig. 7) from salt lake brine using LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5. Raw brine collected from salt lakes first undergoes pretreatment to remove impurity ions such as Mg2+and Ca2+, with the solution pH adjusted to 7.0 to optimize adsorption conditions. The conditioned brine then enters an adsorption column where granular LiAl-LDHs/ZSM-5 adsorbent dynamically enriches lithium ions at 25 °C with a solid-to-liquid ratio of 10 g L−1. The lithium-saturated adsorbent is regeneratedviawater elution to obtain a lithium-enriched solution, while the depleted adsorbent can be recycled through washing and reactivation. Finally, the lithium-rich solution undergoes sodium carbonate precipitation and crystallization at 90 °C, yielding battery-grade lithium carbonate with purity exceeding 99.5%. This process demonstrates high adsorption capacity, excellent selectivity, and remarkable adsorbent recyclability, showing significant industrial application potential.
