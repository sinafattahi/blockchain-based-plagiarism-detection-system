Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.

Our theoretical motivation to study TAMs stems greatly from their central role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. TAMs interact with virtually all immune cell types, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), to regulate effector responses through cytokine secretion, checkpoint ligand expression, and metabolic competition. For example, M2-polarized TAMs secrete interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-β, which inhibit cytotoxic T-cell activity while recruiting regulatory T (Treg) cells via C-C motif ligand 22 (CCL22), thereby establishing an immunosuppressive mechanism. In contrast, proinflammatory M1-like TAMs enhance antigen presentation and secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or IL-12 to stimulate antitumor immunity. This plasticity, driven by signals such as interferon (IFN)-γ or IL-4, highlights the need to investigate the molecular pathways that govern TAM polarization. Indeed, TAMs are associated with resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, making the modulation of TAMs a key strategy for improving clinical outcomes. For example, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors and CD47-blocking antibodies targeting TAM recruitment or phagocytosis have entered clinical trials, reflecting their translational potential.

Although there has been continuous progress in the course of TAM research, there are still several major controversies that compel us to organize, reflect and summarize systematically. The traditional M1/M2 dichotomy, although useful, oversimplifies the heterogeneity of the TAM. Single-cell RNA (scRNA-seq) sequencing has revealed distinct TAM subpopulations, such as C1Q+ macrophages in hepatocellular carcinomas and FN1+ TAMs in gliomas, which define traditional classification and exhibit unique functional characteristics. Furthermore, there is conflicting evidence regarding the prognostic value of TAMs: high infiltration of TAMs is usually associated with poor survival in patients with breast and lung cancers, but in some cases, such as those with colorectal cancer, there is a paradoxical relationship with improved prognosis. These differences may stem from spatial heterogeneity, as TAMs at the tumor margins exhibit a different phenotype than do TAMs in the tumor core, or from differences in marker selection methods. In addition, the optimal treatment strategy continues to be debated; should we eliminate TAMs completely or reprogram their polarization? Or can specific signaling axes be disrupted without exacerbating systemic immunosuppression? These questions are waiting to be discussed and resolved.

In this review, we first trace the historical milestones of TAM research, from early observations linking inflammation to cancer to modern discoveries of TAM plasticity. We then delineated the TAM subtypes, their distributions in the TME, and the clinical implications of their heterogeneity. We also dissected the signaling pathways and multilayered regulatory mechanisms that govern TAM function and explored TAM interactions with other immune cells. On the basis of these findings, we discuss the therapeutic potential of antibody‒drug conjugates (ADCs) that target TAMs and critically evaluate strategies to modulate TAMs, ranging from pharmacological interventions to gene editing. The present review organizes TAM biology within a historical and cutting-edge framework, aiming to foster innovative research and translate mechanistic insights into transformative therapies, ultimately bridging the gap between clinical discovery and clinical practice.

Since the 19th century, scientists have improved their understanding of the relationship between inflammation and cancer. In 1863, Rudolf Virchow first described the connection between inflammation and tumors, and the roles of these two cell types were previously described, suggesting that inflammation may be causally related to cancer.9In the late 19th century, Elie Metchnikoff began studying phagocytic cells in the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial systems, which later became known as macrophages,10and won the Nobel Prize in 1908. In 1923, the concept of the reticuloendothelial system was introduced, distinguishing macrophages from other small phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils.11By the 1970s, scientists had discovered the clonal stimulating factors that induce macrophage differentiation, with colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) being the first such factor discovered.12In 1972, research revealed the prevailing theory that the immune system may promote cancer growth.13The development of monoclonal antibody technology in the 1980s made it possible to identify and isolate macrophages. The use of genetically engineered mouse models in the 1990s further advanced cancer research. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of the TME on malignant tumors was explored after the 1990s. In the 21st century, studies have shown that the depletion of macrophages can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis while promoting angiogenesis. In 2012–2013, scientists discovered that resident macrophages in tissues originate from the yolk sac.14In 2018, research confirmed that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can be reprogrammed into an antitumor state. In 2019, a CSF1R inhibitor was approved for the treatment of certain types of tumors. Recent research has revealed an association between TAMs and poor prognosis, providing a new perspective for cancer treatment15(Fig.1).

Tumor-associated macrophages play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment, as extensively studied, highlighting their contribution to tumor progression and metastasis. These cells exert immunosuppressive effects through various mechanisms and are associated with the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The phenotypic diversity of TAMs has been observed across different tumor types, with multiple TAM subtypes identified, some of which are linked to poor prognosis. The subtypes of TAMs associated with poor prognosis mainly include M2 TAMs. M2 TAMs promote the antiapoptotic ability of tumor cells by secreting IL-6, IL-10 and other cytokines and increase the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs. For example, M2 TAMs in breast cancer tissue promote resistance to doxorubicin in tumor cells through the paracrine circuit of IL-6.16Additionally, M2 TAMs can inhibit the activation and proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), weaken their antitumor immunity, and reduce the antitumor effect of cytotoxic drugs.17Transcriptome-wide profiling of TAMs has revealed their complex roles in the tumor microenvironment, including immunosuppression and promotion of angiogenesis.18,19Single-cell RNA sequencing studies have provided insights into the heterogeneity of TAMs, revealing distinct phenotypes and functions within tumors. The investigation of TAMs has propelled the consideration of macrophages as targets for cancer therapy, particularly in clinical trials targeting CD47.20The origin and dynamics of TAMs have been elucidated through fate mapping techniques, shedding light on their differentiation process within the tumor microenvironment. TAMs have demonstrated immunosuppressive and proangiogenic properties in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, which are closely related to tumor growth and metastasis. The clinical importance of TAMs is underscored by their correlation with poor prognosis in various human cancers, indicating their potential significance in cancer therapy.

In recent years, M2 macrophages have been classified into four subtypes, M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d, according to the differences in cytokines and signaling pathways involved in macrophage activation,27–30and these four subtypes differ in tumor microenvironments and have their own unique functions, which will be described next. Next, we describe the differences and functions of each of these four macrophage subtypes.

In M2a macrophages, IL-4 and IL-13 are the main cytokines that can polarize macrophages to the M2a phenotype;31M2b macrophages are activated primarily by the expression of high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to combined exposure to IgG immune complexes and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists;32,33and M2c macrophages are activated by either glucocorticoid or IL-10-dependent macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) signaling, which induces an M2 macrophage subtype.28Unlike the first three subtypes, M2d macrophages are derived from polarized M1 macrophages28and are induced by IL-6, TLR, and A2 adenosine receptors.27,34In addition, M2b, M2c, and M2d macrophages produce more ATP through anaerobic glycolysis than do M2a macrophages, which are more dependent on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS for energy supply.

In summary, the four subtypes of M2 macrophages, although differing in polarization mode and surface markers, promote tumor growth and metastasis mainly by exerting similar effects, such as anti-inflammatory and angiogenesis-promoting effects.

Using single-cell sequencing technology, multiple novel macrophage subpopulations can be identified, and they influence tumor progression through different signaling pathways; for example, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-ALKAL1 signaling is a key regulator of the MerTK+ macrophage subpopulation,54and in-depth studies of these novel macrophages may be able to identify new targets for tumor therapy.

The difference in the surface markers of TAMs is also one of the reasons why M1 and M2 macrophages play different roles in tumor tissues. Notably, although there are some common TAM surface markers, such as CD11b, CD11c, and CD64, in humans and mice, there are still differences. In humans, the TAM marker is the universal marker CD68, whereas in mice, it is the specific universal marker F4/80.55Qiao T et al. reported that F4/80 TAMs are close to neovascularization and tumor vessels and are prone to angiogenesis in vivo. It also strongly promoted the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), Ki67 and other key angiogenesis markers in endothelial cells in vitro.56H.H. Lin et al. reported that the F4/80 molecule plays a crucial role in the development of Ag-specific regulatory T cells that can inhibit Ag-specific immunity, providing direct evidence for its role in the induction of Ag-specific tolerance.57By searching the relevant data, we summarized and drawn a table of the main types of surface markers of M1 and M2 macrophages, the different roles of different surface markers and the related pathways (Table1) so that we can further explore the mechanisms underlying the different meanings.

TAMs are the most abundant cell population in the tumor immune microenvironment, and TAM infiltration is closely associated with tumor stage and metastasis. Zheng et al. studied 104 lung cancer patients and reported that the density of M1-type TAMs was greater than that of M2-type TAMs and that the density of M2 invasive margin (IM)-TAMs was significantly greater.58There was no significant difference in the density of M1 TAMs between the tumor center (TC) and IM regions. TAMs infiltrated more of the stroma than the parenchyma in both the M1 and M2 types. Patients with high-density M1 TAMs had greater overall survival (OS) benefits, whereas M2 TAM density was not significantly associated with overall survival. The probability of metastasis significantly increased with increasing proximity of the tumor to M2 TC-TAMs or M2 IM-TAMs, and tumor size was correlated with the proximity of M2 IM-TAMs, with larger tumors being closer to each other.

Every adult tissue contains a rich population of resident macrophages; for example, in the breast, there are at least two resident macrophage populations: stromal and ductal macrophages (SM and DM, respectively). Laviron et al.59identified several TAM subpopulations in breast tumors that exhibit different ecological niches from those of macrophage subpopulations prior to tumor development and reported that the TAM composition shifts between proliferative and malignant neoplastic lesions; for example, the expression of CD11b is significantly elevated in malignant neoplastic lesion-associated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cells compared with that in proliferative lesions, which is consistent with the CD11b phenotype of macrophages in the pretumor tissue epithelium. The classification of M1, M2-type macrophages has already been widely used for the classification of TAMs; however, a growing body of research and evidence now suggests that this classification is oversimplified and that macrophages exhibit different transcriptomes in response to different external stimuli, and TAM heterogeneity has been described in different tumor models. Huang et al. investigated the relationship between the tumor environment and the heterogeneity of TAMs via multiplex immunohistochemistry in 56 gastric cancer (GC) cases.60There was an increase in M2-type TAMs at the edge of the tumor and an increase in M1-type TAMs in the core. The study classified TAMs into seven populations and revealed that CD68+, CD68+CD206++ and CD68+CD163+CD206+ cells were enriched in all regions of interest. CD68+CD163+CD206+ cells accumulated the most at the margins, decreasing toward the core, whereas the opposite was true for CD68+IRF8+ cells. CD68+CD163+ and CD68+CD206+ cells were more densely packed in tumors than in normal tissue. These findings suggest that TAMs polarize according to their location. In addition, the macrophage count was correlated with patient recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS. These findings indicate that the distribution of TAMs is different in different tumor immune microenvironments and that the different distributions of TAMs affect tumorigenesis and progression, which in turn affects the prognosis of patients. We may be able to treat tumors by regulating the spatial distribution and number of TAMs in the TME.

TAMs have dual influences as both promoters of tumorigenesis and designers of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, which allows them to fight against tumor cells and, at the same time, may promote tumor growth and spread (Fig.3). This dual role depends mainly on the two subtypes of TAMs: type M1 and type M2. Type M1 TAMs are usually associated with an antitumor immune response, with the ability to promote inflammation and kill tumor cells. In contrast, M2-type TAMs are usually associated with the suppression of immune responses, the promotion of tumor growth, and the support of angiogenesis.

Tumor-associated macrophages are important immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, and they play a key role in tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. TAMs interact with tumor cells through a variety of signaling pathways to promote tumor progression. The following are some of the key signaling pathways associated with the function of TAMs.

Another pathway that promotes inflammation and tumor cell proliferation is the STAT pathway. TAMs have multiple effects on the STAT signaling pathway, and they can activate or inhibit the STAT signaling pathway by secreting cytokines and growth factors, thereby affecting tumor growth and progression. TAMs can secrete a variety of cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, which can activate Janus kinase (JAK), which phosphorylates STAT3, causing it to form a dimer and translocate to the nucleus, initiating the transcription of downstream genes. The activation of STAT3 promotes the expression of a variety of genes, including VEGF, MMPs, and cyclin D1, which are associated with tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and progression. tumor angiogenesis, invasion and proliferation. Studies have shown that STAT3 can also promote the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which inhibits the antitumor activity of T cells. One study revealed that in ovarian cancer, STAT3-activated TAMs can express PD-L1 and bind to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptors on T cells, leading to T-cell inactivation.72The activation of STAT5 can promote the expression of various genes, including Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which are related to cell survival and proliferation.

Angiogenesis is an important process in tumor biology and plays a key role in promoting tumor nutrition and oxygen supply; metabolism and growth; invasion and metastasis; and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Among them, the VEGF pathway and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) pathway are strongly influenced by TAMs, which can secrete VEGF, activate the VEGF pathway, and promote tumor angiogenesis. Moreover, HIF-1α is upregulated in TAMs, which can increase VEGF expression and further promote angiogenesis. Therefore, inhibiting the angiogenic process has become an important strategy in tumor therapy, by which angiogenesis can be inhibited to slow or stop tumor growth and metastasis. For example, antiangiogenic drugs such as Avastin and Sorafenib have been used to treat certain types of cancer.

MMPs are a group of protein hydrolases capable of degrading the ECM; they play a key role in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, and the action of TAMs on the MMP pathway involves a variety of mechanisms. TAMs can activate the production and secretion of MMPs by secreting a variety of cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and TGF-β, to activate the production and secretion of MMPs. One study revealed that TAMs can induce the production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 via IL-1β.73Moreover, certain proteases secreted by TAMs, such as histone B (Cathepsin B), can activate inactive pre-MMPs (e.g., pre-MMP-2 and pre-MMP-9) to become active forms. Active MMPs can degrade the ECM, providing a pathway for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. TAM-mediated activation of the MMP pathway also promotes the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer tumor cells.

First, TAMs can express PD-L1, one of the ligands for PD-1. PD-L1 binds to the PD-1 receptor on T cells and inhibits T-cell activation and function. One study revealed that in ovarian cancer, TAMs express PD-L1 and bind to the PD-1 receptor on T cells, leading to T-cell inactivation.74TAMs also express the PD-1 receptor. The activation of PD-1 can inhibit the phagocytosis and clearance of TAMs, which can affect the immunosurveillance role of TAMs. A previous study revealed that the inhibition of PD-1 enhances the phagocytosis of TAMs, thereby prolonging survival time in a mouse model of colon cancer.75In addition, TAMs can interact with T cells and inhibit the antitumor immune response of T cells through the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. This interaction can lead to T-cell depletion and dysfunction, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis.

Second, the action of TAMs on the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathway involves multiple mechanisms. CTLA-4 is an immune checkpoint molecule that is expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and inhibits the activation and proliferation of T cells. TAMs can express CTLA-4 and bind to the CTLA-4 ligands B7.1 and B7.2 on T cells, which inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation.76This inhibition reduces the killing of tumor cells by T cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. TAMs can also secrete immunosuppressive molecules, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, which can act synergistically with the CTLA-4 pathway to further enhance the immunosuppressive effect.

The activation and regulation of these signaling pathways in TAMs are very complex, and they are intertwined with each other, not only affecting tumor growth and metastasis but also participating in the development of the tumor microenvironment, which plays an important role in immune escape and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of these signaling pathways can help in the development of new tumor therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of treatment by regulating the function of TAMs.

In addition, TAMs can help tumors evade immune surveillance by suppressing adaptive immune responses. Organisms can inhibit tumorigenesis and development through natural and acquired immunity, while tumor cells can evade recognition and attack by the organism’s immune system through a variety of mechanisms. The inhibition of antitumor immunity by TAMs involves the following mechanisms: (1) tumor cells produce IL-10, which induces the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of TAMs,88binds to PD-1 on the surface of T cells in the TME, and inhibits cytotoxic T-cell function; (2) TAMs produce CCL22, which recruits regulatory T cells into the TME and inhibits the activation and function of effector T cells;89and (3) TAMs produce Arg-1, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine, inhibits the upregulation of cytokinin D3 and cytokinin-dependent kinase 4, and prevents the T-cell cycle from proliferating by arresting in the G0/G1 phase.90Overall, TAMs play dual roles as “immune suppressors” and “tumor promoters” because they can promote tumorigenesis and act as central drivers of the immunosuppressive TME.

The process of specific recognition and clearance of tumor cells by immune cells is complex, and macrophages are among the most important members of this process. TAMs are key components of leukocyte infiltration and are widely observed in a variety of tumors. In most studies, the density of TAMs has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients,91whereas very few studies have shown that the density of TAMs in the TME is associated with good prognosis.92This duality has been found in a variety of cancers, including prostate, lung, and brain cancers.93Other researchers have reported that TAMs inhibit the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Both the M1 and M2 isoforms of TAM inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma cells under certain conditions.94The dual nature of the TME may be due to the influence of other cell types present within the TME.

More importantly, when macrophages express CSF-1R, tumor cells secrete M-CSF to attract TAMs,108and after TAMs are attracted to tumor cells, they secrete EGF, which activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in tumor cells, and the activation of the EGFR pathway results in the extension of more pseudopods in tumor cells.101Since myeloid cells are highly mobile and less compact, tumor cells combined with TAMs can gain stronger metastatic ability and are more likely to metastasize to the distal end.

In summary, TAMs play multiple facilitating roles in the process of tumor metastasis, helping tumor cells evade immune surveillance, invade surrounding tissues, enter the blood circulation and colonize distant organs to form metastatic foci through multiple mechanisms.

Cell signaling plays a crucial role in regulating macrophage function, particularly in tumor immunity and disease progression. Studies have shown that pyroptosis induced by photocatalytic carbon dots can significantly increase the antigen-presenting capacity of macrophages, thereby triggering specific tumor immune responses and providing new insights for tumor immunotherapy.112Furthermore, clusterin (CLU) promotes the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype by inducing mitochondrial damage and activating the type I interferon pathway, thus enhancing their antitumor capabilities.113This mechanism further highlights the central role of organelle signaling in tumor immune responses.

With respect to the metabolic regulation of macrophages, M1 macrophages exhibit downregulation of c-Myc expression under proinflammatory stimuli, which inhibits proliferation while upregulating HIF-1α and glycolysis. In contrast, M2 macrophages upregulate c-Myc, promoting their differentiation toward the anti-inflammatory phenotype.114These metabolic changes determine the immune function of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of tumors.

Moreover, Caspase-1 enhances the protumor function of TAMs by specifically cleaving Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), while tumor cells counteract phagocytosis by overexpressing glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2), thereby inhibiting macrophage mitochondrial fission.116These studies not only underscore the importance of organelle function and signaling pathways in the interaction between macrophages and tumor cells but also reveal the potential of these pathways as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.

In addition, TAMs can increase the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy and targeted therapy by secreting antiapoptotic factors, regulating the cell cycle, promoting DNA repair, etc. IL-10 secreted by TAMs can inhibit Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis, thus protecting tumor cells from being killed by chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, TGF-β secreted by TAMs can inhibit the expression of the cell cycle protein-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27, leading to an uncontrolled cell cycle and increased drug resistance in tumor cells. A study on lung cancer revealed that TAMs promote the migration and invasion of tumor cells through the secretion of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 and simultaneously increase the resistance of tumor cells to EGFR inhibitors,18reducing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs, such as inhibiting their immunosuppressive activity or promoting their antitumor function, may help reduce tumor recurrence and improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy.

As major components of TME, TAMs interact with immune cells including T cells, dendritic cells, Tumor-associated neutrophils, B cells, Kupffer cells. The interaction between TAMs and other immune cells is briefly illustrated in Fig.4.

While the immunity of Th2 cells to parasites and the pathogenic role of allergic diseases are well established, the regulation and function of Th2 cells in the TME remain largely neglected and controversial. In general, Th2 cell immunity to tumors is mediated by Th2 cytokines and acts synergistically with macrophages through secondary recruitment of tumor-killing myeloid cells, such as eosinophils.145,146It has been demonstrated that mice deficient in the Th2 cytokines IL-2 and IL-4 show reduced tumor clearance.147Neutralization of IL-4 by monoclonal antibodies may also help restore tumor growth.148–152The possible mechanism involves the secretion of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 by Th2 cells, which prompts the transformation of TAMs into M2-type macrophages, which in turn promotes tumor growth.

The escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance is one of the key events regulating tumor growth, survival and metastasis. TAMs in an M2 macrophage-like state have poor antigen presentation capacity and suppress the immune response of T cells by releasing the immunosuppressive factors IL-10 and TGF-β, which include the inhibition of the cytotoxic function of NK cells.183Kuang and colleagues reported that TNF-α and IL-10 secretion by activated monocytes strongly induced PD-L1 expression in an autocrine manner and that PD-L1-positive monocytes induced T-cell dysfunction, which was defined as low cytotoxicity against tumor cells and reduced T-cell proliferation.184TAMs can bind to inhibitory receptors on NK cells, such as PD-1, through the expression of such inhibitory receptor ligands, which can in turn inhibit NK cell function.

Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have provided profound insights into the intricate interactions between TAMs and DCs within the TME. In hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC), scRNA-seq analysis revealed a collaborative interplay between TAMs and LAMP3+ DCs, leading to the establishment of an immunosuppressive milieu that facilitates tumor progression by recruiting regulatory T cells while inhibiting CD8+ T-cell function. This interaction highlights the concerted efforts of TAMs and LAMP3+ DCs in promoting immune evasion mechanisms within tumors.190Similarly, scRNA-seq profiling in early lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) demonstrated an increased presence of both TAMs and CD1C+ DCs, which correlated with accelerated tumor progression. Although no distinct M1 or M2 polarization was observed, these cellular components likely contribute to immune evasion and tumorigenesis within the TME.191These findings underscore the intricate interplay between TAMs and DCs in modulating both antitumor immunity and disease progression.

Tumor-associated macrophages and Kupffer cells are closely related in both physiological and pathological states. Kupffer cells, liver macrophages with M1 characteristics, can clear pathogens from the blood. Moreover, Kupffer cells exhibit the same phenotype, suggesting that TAMs and Kupffer cells undergo a dynamic transformation process in the tumor microenvironment.56TAM receptors, particularly phosphatidylserine receptors such as Tim-4, are crucial for Kupffer cell phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. These receptors help Kupffer cells eliminate apoptotic cells and inflammatory mediators, reduce liver injury and inflammation, and modulate the inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions of Kupffer cells, which are crucial for liver health and disease treatment.200,201Overall, the TAM–Kupffer cell interrelationship spans phagocytosis regulation, tumor microenvironment dynamics, and liver modulation.

In previous studies, monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective in the diagnosis and treatment of hematologic malignancies and various solid tumors,202,203and they act by targeting tumor-associated antigens, which can inhibit cell growth and angiogenesis or stimulate a lasting immune response against tumors to achieve antitumor effects.204,205ADCs have emerged as needed,206which combines the targeting method of monoclonal antibodies with the ability of chemotherapy to kill tumor tissues while protecting healthy tissues, leading to major breakthroughs in the field of cancer treatment.207,208To date, ADCs have become an important approach in cancer treatment. Infiltrating immune cells have been shown to play important roles in promoting tumorigenesis and progression,93and TAM infiltration is usually associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients, which inevitably affects tumor therapy.209TAMs are potent effectors of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, contributing to the antitumor activity of anticancer monoclonal antibodies such as anti-CD20 and anti-HER-2.210In fact, TAMs have been previously shown to be associated with the response to targeted anticancer drugs,211and many studies have confirmed that trastuzumab can trigger the phagocytosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cells by macrophages,212,213which suggests a potential role for TAMs in the antitumor activity of antibody therapy. The interaction between TAMs and ADCs is mediated by the Fcγ receptor (FcγR), which leads to the internalization of ADCs and treatment by TAMs, followed by the release of the payload in the TME.214For further validation, Li et al. compared the antitumor activity and intratumoral drug concentration of targeted and nontargeted (hlgG-vcMMAE) monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugates and reported that nontargeted ADCs could bind to F4/80+TAMs, and their abundance correlated with the in vivo antitumor activity of nontargeted ADCs in lymphoma and breast cancer models. These findings demonstrated the ability of TAMs to internalize ADCs with FcγR and subsequently process ADCs to release their payload.215Their study was the first to demonstrate this phenomenon even in the absence of antigen binding. TAMs can also interact with therapeutic ADCs. A study by Selby et al. demonstrated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies act through macrophages expressing Fcγ receptors.216They demonstrated in mouse model experiments that macrophage-mediated elimination of Treg cells by ADCC is an important component of anti-CTLA-4 therapeutic activity.216Many previous studies have demonstrated that the development of ADC drugs that target TAMs may provide a new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

TAMs, as important immune cells, can interact with various factors in the TME.217As an increasing number of studies have explored the relationship between TAMs and tumors, we have shown that TAMs have unique characteristics during tumor progression to malignancy. Many studies have shown that TAMs in tumor tissues tend to polarize to the M2 type once they affect or interact with the tumor extracellular matrix,218,219suggesting an important role for TAMs in early tumor prediction, therapeutic intervention and even prognosis prediction.

TAMs are important components of the tumor microenvironment and account for a high percentage of immune cells. They are involved in the whole process of tumorigenesis, development and metastasis by promoting the growth of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, inhibiting immune responses and regulating immune responses. In view of the important role of TAMs in tumor progression, TAM-based tumor prediction, prognostic assessment and targeted therapy have emerged. In the future, the construction of models based on TAM-related genes for the prediction of tumorigenesis and prognosis may be a very promising research field. In addition, research related to the cooperation of TAM-targeted therapy with immunotherapy, conventional chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy in the interventional treatment of patients with tumors is also a very promising option. Multimodal prediction and intervention based on TAM may become a hot research topic in the future.

A significant strategy of immunotherapy is regulating the number of TAMs. The following section will investigate this mechanism in detail. Table2summarizes the main target sites for TAMs regulation.

Clinical experiments have confirmed that TAMs can help tumor cells form an inflammatory environment after tumorigenesis, which is conducive to the growth of tumor cells, while their ability to promote angiogenesis enhances the migration and invasion ability of tumor cells.247Tumor cells are able to secrete some cytokines to recruit TAMs through their cellular pathways of action, further constructing a tumor microenvironment that is conducive to the growth of tumor cells and contributes to tumor development.248Therefore, termination of macrophage recruitment in cancer tissues can block macrophage growth and signaling pathways of differentiation, thus reducing the ability of TAMs to promote tumor development and spread.

Several drugs have been demonstrated to have ancillary effects on TAM recruitment. Total glucosides of paeony (TGPs) have been found to inhibit the release of inflammatory factors, and there is evidence of their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.253,254Jin et al.255revealed the great role and therapeutic potential of TGP in altering the inflammatory microenvironment of tumors, revealing that TGP can be used to inhibit the release of inflammatory factors via the NF-κB/CCL2 signaling pathway and thus reduce the recruitment of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment, as well as to inhibit M2-type polarization by decreasing the expression of mRNAs in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages (LPS-stimulated macrophages), ultimately exerting a regulatory effect on TAMs. A reduction in the release of inflammation-related factors (e.g., CCL2) further reduces the infiltration of TAMs. It improves the inflammatory microenvironment of the tumor, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic processes.

NT157, a small-molecule inhibitor of immunotherapeutic drugs, can exert its antitumor effects mainly through two signaling pathways, the IGF-1R-IRS and JAK-STAT3 pathways. Sanchez-Lopez et al.259found that NT157 reduces the aggregation of TAMs in tumor cells, mainly by blocking the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. Cytokines such as IL-6, which has the ability to protect intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis, are inducible to STAT3. By blocking the expression of these cytokines, NT157 can block the activation of STAT3, which further achieves the goal of inhibiting the recruitment of TAMs and reducing the number of TAMs.

In addition, both BLZ945 and PLX3397 were able to modulate the immune cell infiltration profile. For example, increasing the immune infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor sites. In combination therapy with monoclonal antibodies, this can further promote the polarization of TAMs toward the M1 type.265These findings suggest that CSF1/CSF1R is a viable therapeutic target and may be used in combination with other therapies. These discoveries provide promising therapeutic approaches and treatment ideas for immunotherapy.

One way to regulate TAMs is by increasing their immunostimulatory capacity. TAMs can be polarized into M1-type and M2-type TAMs, where M1-type TAMs have antitumor and immune-promoting effects,266whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor development by suppressing the immune system. In recent years, M2-type TAMs have also been shown to be strongly associated with weaker immunotherapeutic efficacy and other adverse clinical outcomes, such as drug resistance in patients during anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.267Therefore, the activation of M1-type TAMs with antitumor activity, or the promotion of TAM polarization to the antitumor type, can enhance the ability of TAMs to phagocytose and kill tumor cells. Reeducation of M2 TAMs can effectively achieve this goal. Reprogramming TAMs to release their immunostimulatory capacity could be achieved via three main strategies: signaling pathway regulation, cytokine regulation and metabolite regulation, which reverse the phenotype of TAMs to remodel the tumor microenvironment.

Tumor cells evade macrophage phagocytosis by overexpressing CD47, which binds to SIRP-α on macrophages, transmitting a “do not eat me” signal. Consequently, the CD47-SIRPα axis is now recognized as an immune checkpoint for macrophages and a potential target for immunotherapy. Research has shown that blocking the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway could actively shift TAMs toward an antitumor profile by reeducating the M2 type and enriching the M1 type to restore phagocytic function. Tang et al.270reported M1-macrophage-derived hybrid nanovesicles (SPI@hEL-RS17) with RS17, a CD47-specific antitumor peptide that effectively inhibits CD47-SIRPα signaling. Blockade of CD47 enabled M1 TAMs to be enriched in the TME and produce greater tumor-phagocytosing effects. Similar effects were observed in Zhao’s research, which constructed a stimuli-responsive multifunctional nanoplatform (ZIF-PQ-PDA-AUN) to increase the phagocytotic ability of macrophages, reversing M2-type TAMs into M1-type TAMs.271Although direct mechanistic evidence for TAM re-education is limited, these findings, which succeeded in reversing the TAM phenotype, provide a feasible and promising strategy for improving the therapeutic index with low-toxicity immunotherapy.

TAMs can participate in antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by mediating the phagocytosis pathway and eliminating target cells through specific antibodies. Li et al.272reported that resiquimod (R848) promotes ADCP by stimulating M1-type macrophages and shifting TAMs from the M2 phenotype to the M1 phenotype. Compared with monotherapy, combination therapy with TLR7/8 agonists resulted in more efficient TAM re-education. Figueiredo et al.273M2-type TAMs were targeted with mUNO peptides on lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying a dual agonist of the Toll-like receptor TLR7/8 (Resiquimod, R848), achieving effective low-dose treatment and re-educating M2-type macrophages to M1-type macrophages, enhancing the antitumor immune response.

The Wnt signaling pathway was demonstrated to be a driver of the immunosuppressive phenotype of M2 TAMs, which could also affect the communication between tumor cells and TAMs.274Thus, drugs that affect Wnt signaling may exert an indirect effect on TAMs. Andrographolide (ADE), a drug that can directly promote the apoptosis of tumor cells through cytotoxicity and inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis, has recently been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating TAMs. Li et al.275reported that ADEs significantly inhibited the polarization of TAMs toward the M2 phenotype and promoted the polarization of the M1 phenotype, ultimately inhibiting triple-negative breast cancer. Further research on the underlying mechanism by transcriptome sequencing revealed that ADEs act mainly on the Wnt signaling pathway, inhibiting the expression of the Wnt5a, β-catenin, MMP-9 and MMP-2 proteins in the signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner, thus reducing the invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of tumor cells.

CRISPR/Cas9 is a commonly used gene editing technology that enables the editing and regulation of specific genes in TAMs, allowing for precise alteration of their phenotype and function.285Zhao et al.286used bacterial protoplast-derived nanovesicles to deliver CRISPR-Cas9, which targets Pik3cg in TAMs. This suppressed PI3Kγ signaling, reducing the expression of M2 markers (CD206 and IL-10) and increasing the expression of M1 markers (CD86 and TNF-α), which inhibited tumor growth by reprogramming TAMs in 4T1 and MC38 mouse models. The success of this practice provides a viable option to achieve the regulation of TAMs by effectively silencing genes that promote TAMs. In glioblastoma, a tumor suppressor gene, the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, is deleted, leading to increased secretion of galectin-9 (Gal-9), which induces polarization of TAMs toward the M2 type. Knockdown of the CCR2 gene effectively reduces the level of infiltration of TAMs and achieves the clearance of TAMs.262(Fig.6).

Targeted gene silencing technology mediated by siRNA or shRNA is able to inhibit or reduce the expression of target genes, thus altering the phenotype or function of TAMs and regulating them. Targeting the CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling pathway to disrupt CSF-1R expression has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential across various cancers. In prostate cancer (PCa), a study utilizing M2 macrophage-targeting peptides for the delivery of siRNA specifically to M2 TAMs reported an increase in M1 TAM expression, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of M2-specific markers (CD68+/CD206+). These findings indicate the successful reprogramming of M2 TAMs into the M1 phenotype via siRNA-mediated modulation.287Similarly, in pancreatic cancer (PC), siRNA-mediated interference targeting the same pathway in combination with the PI3K-γ inhibitor BEZ235 yielded comparable outcomes. Notably, BEZ235 alone demonstrated the ability to modulate TAM phenotypes through the suppression of the phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) pathway. Moreover, the combination therapy exhibited synergistic effects, significantly enhancing TAM phenotype reprogramming compared with single agent treatments, with markedly reduced production of IL-6, a signature cytokine of M2 macrophages that is also closely associated with pancreatic cancer progression. In experiments where IL4RPep-1 was modified on the surface for targeted transfection of NF-κBp50 siRNA as well as miR-511-3p into M1-type exosomes, significant downregulation of the expression of M2 markers and cytokines (Arg1, TFG-β, IL-10, and IL-4) was observed, whereas M1 cytokines (IL-12p40 and IFN-γ) were upregulated, suggesting the ability to reprogram the M2 type to the M1 type.288Researchers have designed nanoparticles (NPs), which include trimethyl chitosan (PEG = MT) and citraconic anhydride-grafted poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PC) (PEG = MT/PC NPs). The NPs were then double modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mannose (MT) and internally wrapped with VEGF siRNA (siVEGF)/PIGF siRNA (siPIGF) for targeted delivery to M2-type TAMs. These NPs then aggregated at high concentrations in the tumor cells and effectively silenced the target genes after their contents were released. This ultimately repolarizes the M2 type to the M1 type and achieves the regulation of TAMs.289Selective silencing of genes related to M2-type TAMs can effectively reduce the aggregation of M2-type TAMs. However, to achieve this goal, the targeting ability and effectiveness of siRNA transfer into target cells need to be improved, and the combination of nanotechnology may be a promising solution.

Macrophages exhibit dual protective and pathogenic effects on cancer development. As macrophages, especially TAMs, are essential immune cell components in the TME, the distribution of TAMs is closely associated with cancer progression, therapeutic response and prognosis. As mentioned above, proper modulation of macrophages can increase their antitumor ability. Thus, unraveling the antitumor potency of M1 macrophages through several regulatory strategies to leverage their phagocytic function has now become the main strategy in cancer therapy and has already been proven in several preclinical and clinical studies. The FDA has approved several macrophage-based therapies, and more drugs are now in the clinical trial stage.

Employing the strategies discussed earlier in the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway could reveal the potential of identifying and phagocytosing macrophages. Several drugs that block this pathway have been tested for therapeutic efficacy and toxicity in clinical trials (Table3).

Immunotherapy uses humanized IgG4 anti-CD47 antibodies (Abs) or anti-SIRPα antibodies. First-generation Abs, including CC-90002 and Magrolimab, exhibit off-target effects, which lead to relatively severe hematotoxicity. Moreover, the next-generation Abs Lemzoparlimab and Ligufalimab reduce off-target binding to red blood cells (RBCs), which does not cause substantial hematotoxicity. Both generations block CD47, which has been shown to enhance antitumor effects on hematological malignancies and solid tumors. These drugs are currently in clinical trials, with promising outcomes in the next-generation group.

The first generation of anti-CD47 antibodies appears to have a high incidence of off-target adverse effects. This is because CD47 is widely expressed in somatic cells, especially red blood cells (RBCs), which cause adverse hematologic events, including anemia and thrombocytopenia, and hematotoxicity seems to be Fc dependent. Several clinical trials have been terminated because of intolerable treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs).290–292With respect to the Fc portion of anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), researchers have reported that the Fc-FcγR interaction is required to fully trigger macrophage phagocytosis and maximize antitumor effects.293However, current anti-CD47 mAbs are mainly humanized IgG4, which lacks Fc-FcγR interaction. This finding reveals the need for restructuring the Fc portion to achieve AE alleviation and increased therapeutic efficacy.

Next-generation antibodies are targeted to minimize off-target effects by reducing the binding of anti-CD47 Abs to RBCs and platelets. Compared with previous anti-CD47 mAbs, significant alleviation of AEs was observed in clinical trials. Patients with CD20-positive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the relapsed and refractory (R/R) state have a 100% disease control rate (DCR) with manageable TRAEs, mainly Grade 1 or 2 TRAEs, after receiving Lemzoparlimab.294In addition, the strong tumor-targeting effect indicates the effectiveness of RBC-sparing therapy. This provides a new strategy for R/R patients and reveals the potential of differentiated Abs.

Anti-CD47 mAbs exhibit limited therapeutic efficacy when combined with other therapies. This limitation arises because, compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies that bind to a single antigen, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) can engage two distinct epitopes on the same cell, increasing their affinity and activating or restraining diverse signaling pathways.295This also helps shape the TME into an antitumorigenic state with alterations in immune cell infiltration and immune-related gene regulation.296The use of bsAbs enables Fc–FcγR interactions, which traditional monoclonal antibodies’ IgG portion cannot achieve, thereby activating key biological processes such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These processes significantly improve the efficacy of both monotherapy and combination therapy, particularly in tumors in which multiple ligands are expressed.297Furthermore, the design of bsAbs with low CD47 affinity can reduce hematotoxicity, addressing one of the major side effects associated with CD47 targeting.298Current co-targeting strategies with CD47, including PD-L1, CD20, CD19, HER2, and 4-IBB (CD137), are being actively investigated in multiple clinical trials. Moreover, additional targets, including CD24, CD33, CD38, CD70, CD123, EGFR, and receptor glypican-3 (GPC3), are under investigation in preclinical studies. For signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), co-targeting with 4-1BB is also being studied, highlighting the promising future of bsAbs in oncology, which has shown effective repolarization of the TAM phenotype, promotion of phagocytosis, and a potent ability to enhance immunotherapeutic effects299–307(Table3).

The current systematic administration of PLX3397 may cause off-target adverse effects, which introduces the need for targeted delivery. Nanotechnology enables precise drug delivery, enhances therapeutic outcomes and reduces off-target effects. Codelivery of CSF-1R inhibitors with other agents or cytokines via nanocarriers can further reshape the immune microenvironment and strengthen antitumor immunity. Hu et al.316used nanotechnology to co-deliver IL-12-expressing genes and the CSF-1R inhibitor PLX3397, effectively activating T-cell-mediated immunity and reducing the number of M2-type TAMs more significantly than single-drug delivery. This approach induced substantial changes in the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating superior efficacy in impeding M2 polarization.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which act as both allies and adversaries during cancer progression, are central players in the tumor microenvironment. This review synthesizes decades of research to unravel their complex biology, clinical relevance, and therapeutic potential. TAMs, derived from circulating monocytes or tissue-resident macrophages, are highly adaptive, polarizing into different functional states—inflammatory M1 or immunosuppressive M2 phenotypes—according to signals from their surroundings. M1 TAMs fight tumors through phagocytosis and cytokine release, and M1 TAMs fight tumors through phagocytosis, cytokine release, and immune activation, whereas M2 TAMs drive tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. However, this M1/M2 dichotomy is oversimplified. Advances in single-cell technology have led to the discovery of multiple TAM subpopulations, such as thrombospondin-1+ (THBS-1+) macrophages in hepatocellular carcinoma and FN1+ TAMs in gliomas, each with unique transcriptional profiles and clinical significance. These findings challenge traditional classification methods and emphasize the need for a nuanced understanding of TAM heterogeneity.

The dual role of TAMs is governed by complex signaling pathways. For example, the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways drive protumorigenic functions such as angiogenesis and immunosuppression, whereas the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis regulates TAM recruitment and survival. The CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway, a key “do not-eat-me” signal utilized by tumors, has emerged as a key therapeutic target. Blocking CD47 enhances phagocytosis by macrophages, a strategy currently being tested in clinical trials. Macrophages also interact dynamically with other immune cells: M2 TAMs recruit regulatory T (Treg) cells via CCL22, suppress CD8+ T cells via PD-L1, and inhibit NK cell activity, thus collectively creating an immunosuppressive environment. Conversely, reprogramming M2 TAMs to an M1-like state via cytokines such as IFN-γ or TLR agonists restores antitumor immunity, highlighting their plasticity and therapeutic potential.

In the clinical setting, TAM represents both a burden and an opportunity. High M2 TAM infiltration is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, making it a valuable biomarker. For example, CD163+ TAMs are predictive of shorter survival in triple-negative breast cancer patients, while spatial distribution patterns provide additional prognostic insights. Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs aim to eliminate TAMs, block their recruitment, or reprogram their function. CSF-1R inhibitors such as PLX3397 reduce the number of immunosuppressive M2 TAMs in preclinical models, whereas anti-CD47 antibodies disrupt “do not-eat-me” signaling to promote phagocytosis. Combining these approaches with chemotherapy or immunotherapy holds promise for overcoming resistance.

Emerging therapies such as CAR-M cells represent a paradigm shift. By modifying macrophages to express chimeric antigen receptors, researchers have created cells capable of selectively targeting tumors, such as HER2+ cancers, while reprogramming the TME. Early trials, such as those involving CT-0508, which targets HER2-positive solid tumors, demonstrated its feasibility and antitumor activity. Similarly, nanotechnology-driven delivery systems can precisely reprogram TAMs in situ, minimizing off-target effects. These innovations emphasize the potential of TAM-focused therapies to complement existing therapies.

However, significant challenges remain. The M1/M2 framework, while useful, fails to capture the full scope of TAM diversity observed in human tumors. Single-cell studies have revealed environmentally relevant subpopulations that cannot be simply categorized; thus, multidimensional classification systems are needed. For example, Kupffer cell-like TAMs in hepatocellular carcinoma differ functionally from microglia-derived TAMs in glioblastoma, reflecting tissue-specific adaptations. In addition, therapeutic strategies that are successful in mice tend to fail in humans because of compensatory mechanisms. CSF-1R inhibitors, although effective at depleting M2 TAMs in preclinical models, have limited clinical efficacy as monotherapies, in part because tumors recruit alternative myeloid cell populations to maintain immunosuppression. The metabolic flexibility of TAMs complicates targeted therapies. M1 TAMs rely on glycolysis, whereas M2 TAMs favor oxidative phosphorylation, a dichotomy that is affected by metabolites such as succinate and itaconic acid. Drugs targeting metabolic enzymes can reprogram TAMs by altering metabolite levels, but their effects vary by tumor type. Similarly, organelle-specific interventions, such as modulating mitochondrial fission in TAMs, show preclinical promise but require deeper mechanistic validation.

Future research must prioritize several areas. First, integrating multi-omics data—spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—will shed light on how TAM subpopulations interact with other cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, to form TMEs. Second, the development of tailored therapies is critical. For example, TAMs in early-stage tumors may require different targeting strategies than TAMs in metastatic niches. Third, improved preclinical models—using patient-derived organ tissues or humanized mice—will improve translational relevance. Finally, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze TAM heterogeneity and predict treatment response could accelerate the development of personalized medicine.

In summary, TAMs are double-edged swords in cancer biology. Their ability to inhibit or promote tumors depends on environmental cues, making them dynamic therapeutic targets. While current strategies, such as CSF-1R inhibition, CD47 blockade, and CAR-M, are promising, overcoming resistance and environment-dependent variability requires innovative approaches. By embracing the complexity of TAM biology and advancing technologies such as single-cell analysis and nanotechnology, novel therapies that transform the TME from a barrier to a battleground for immune-mediated tumor eradication can be developed. This progress will depend on interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge the gap between immunology, bioengineering, and clinical oncology to provide lasting solutions for cancer patients.
