Cancer is commonly
caused by a gain of function in proto-oncogenes
and a simultaneous loss of function in tumor suppressor genes. Advanced
prostate cancer (PCa) is often linked with changes in the activity
or expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
10 (PTEN), a well-known tumor suppressor, and androgen receptor (AR),
a pro-tumorigenic transcription factor. However, no therapies exist
for the simultaneous correction of tumorigenic promotion and suppressor
depletion. Here, we report that concurrent PTEN restoration and AR
silencing by lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of PTEN messenger RNA
(mPTEN) and AR small interfering RNA (siAR) elicited synergistic therapeutic
effects in PCa cells. We screened various LNP formulations for the
optimal delivery of both RNAs. In C4-2 and LNCaP cells, both of which
are AR-positive and PTEN-null PCa cell lines, the combinatorial treatment
of siAR and mPTEN LNPs resulted in much stronger cytotoxicity in vitro
than the treatment of either alone. Western blot analyses revealed
concurrent regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase
B (PI3K-AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways,
leading to increased caspase-3 cleavage-mediated apoptosis. Our findings
suggest that the strategy of RNA-mediated concurrent restoration of
tumor suppressors and inhibition of tumorigenic drivers could lead
to the more effective treatment of PCa and potentially other malignancies.

The spectrum between health
and disease is often associated with
an imbalance between cellular signals that promote activation or inactivation
of distinct biological pathways. In cancers,
this imbalance results from the dysregulation of pro-tumorigenic and
tumor-suppressing pathways.−For example, the progression of
prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer death in
men, is often associated with the loss of tumor suppressors, such
as phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN),
as well as the activation of tumorigenic drivers such as androgen
receptor (AR).−Through negative regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein
kinase B (PI3K-AKT) pathway, PTEN inhibits tumor proliferation, metastasis,
and angiogenesis and also induces apoptosis.,Despite
PCa’s heterogeneous genetic profile, loss of functional PTEN
is found in roughly 20% of early-stage PCa and approximately 50% of
castration-resistant PCa, underscoring its prevalence in the disease.,On the other hand, the AR gene is the most frequently altered gene
in castration-resistant PCa, with an alteration rate of approximately
63% in a multi-institutional cohort of 150 individuals. The most common alteration is AR amplification,
and AR is one of the most therapeutically targeted oncogenic drivers
in PCa. Current therapies for advanced PCa mainly focus on AR signaling
inhibition, which, however, is often limited by the development of
therapeutic resistance.,In addition, AR inhibition
does not address the underlying tumor suppressor loss.−Similarly, direct targeting of the PI3K-AKT pathway may be inadequate
for restoring the regulatory feedback provided by functional PTEN.,,These limitations highlight the
need for an integrative approach to re-establish the balance between
cellular anti- and pro-growth signals mediated by PTEN and AR, respectively,
which could lead to the development of a novel advanced PCa therapy
with more potent efficacy.

Advances in RNA technologies have
recently resulted in multiple
medicines for clinical use, including small interfering RNA (siRNA)
for silencing protein expression and messenger RNA (mRNA) for inducing
protein expression. Six siRNA therapeutics and three mRNA vaccines
have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and
numerous potential RNA therapeutics for cancer and other diseases
are under preclinical and clinical development.−The use of siRNA to silence the
expression of amplified or mutated tumorigenic proteins has been extensively
reported. Additionally, we and others
have recently applied mRNA delivery to restore the tumor suppressor
function. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of tumor suppressor
(e.g., PTEN and p53)-coded mRNA in inhibiting tumor growth, enhancing
antitumor immunity, and improving other therapies such as immune checkpoint
blockade.−We hypothesize that using mRNA and siRNA to concurrently restore
tumor suppressors (e.g., PTEN) and inhibit tumorigenic drivers (e.g.,
AR) could represent a unique strategy for correcting both aspects
of the cellular signaling imbalance for the highly effective treatment
of PCa.

In this study, we developed and screened distinct lipid
nanoparticle
(LNP) formulations for the optimal delivery of siRNA and mRNA, ensuring
minimal cytotoxicity and efficient cellular uptake and RNA transfection.
We investigated combined delivery, defined as the coadministration
of two distinct LNPs, carrying either siAR or mPTEN, as well as codelivery,
defined as the administration of a single LNP, carrying both siAR
and mPTEN. We evaluated the efficacy of this dual-targeting approach
in AR-positive and PTEN-null PCa cells in vitro by examining cell
viability, apoptosis, and key signaling pathways related to PTEN and
AR. Cytotoxicity results revealed that the combined delivery of PTEN
mRNA (mPTEN) and AR siRNA (siAR) LNPs exhibited a combination index
(CI), a quantitative measure of the combined effects of two drugs,
below 0.5 with select RNA concentrations, indicating a strong synergistic
effect. Flow cytometry analysis also showed a significant increase
in early and late apoptosis with over 60% of cells in the combination
group undergoing apoptosis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that
the concurrent restoration of PTEN and inhibition of AR induce significant
apoptosis through caspase-3 activation, decrease cell proliferation
by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) signaling pathways, and disrupt AR-mediated pro-growth signaling.
We expect that this approach of LNP delivery of siRNA and mRNA could
be robustly expanded to many other tumor suppressors and tumorigenic
drivers for a fundamental biological understanding and therapeutic
development.

D-Lin-MC3-DMA (MC3, MCE,
CAS No. 1224606-06-7), SM-102 (MCE, CAS No. 2089251-47-6), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE, Cayman Chemical,
CAS No. 4004-05-1), cholesterol (Sigma, CAS No. 57-88-5), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG2000,
Avanti, CAS No. 880151P) were purchased for LNP formulation. Small
interfering RNAs targeting luciferase (siLuc) and androgen receptor
(siAR) were synthesized by Horizon Discovery. Messenger RNAs targeting
GFP (mGFP) and PTEN (mPTEN) were synthesized by TriLink Bio Technologies.
The AlamarBlue assay (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. A50100) was used for
cell viability assays, and the Annexin V-FITC-PI kit (Thermo Fisher,
Cat. No. A13199) was employed for apoptosis detection. Antibodies
used for Western blotting included anti-AR (CST, Cat No. 5153), anti-PTEN
(Biolegend, Cat No. 655002), anti-pERK (CST, Cat No. 9101), anti-pAKT
(CST, Cat No. 4060), anticleaved caspase-3 (CST, Cat No. 9661), and
antiactin (CST, Cat No. 4967).

LNPs were
formulated by the pipetting technique to encapsulate siRNA or mRNA.
MC3/SM-102, DOPE, cholesterol, and DMG-PEG2000 in different ratios
were dissolved in ethanol. For the optimization of the nitrogen-to-phosphorus
(N:P) ratio for siRNA and mRNA delivery, we varied the amount of ionizable
lipids while keeping the RNA amount constant to achieve ratios of
4, 5, and 6. The lipid mixture was rapidly mixed by pipetting with
an aqueous solution of siRNA or mRNA in a sodium acetate buffer (pH
4.0) at a ratio of 3:1. The resultant LNPs were immediately diluted
in PBS and dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) to remove ethanol and adjust
the pH.

For LNP screening, 12 formulations were prepared for
each siRNA and mRNA payload by varying the LNP components (Table S1). The ionizable lipids, MC3 and SM-102,
were used at different molar percentages along with DOPE, cholesterol,
and DMG-PEG2000. Each formulation was prepared as described above.

C4-2
and LNCaP PCa cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. For transfection experiments, cells were seeded
into 96-well culture plates to achieve a confluence of ∼60–70%.
LNPs containing siRNA or mRNA were incubated with the cells for 24
h. Subsequently, the medium was replaced, and the cells were cultured
for another 24 h before measuring RNA transfection efficiency. For
the siLuc silencing evaluation, cells were lysed using a passive lysis
buffer. Luciferase activity was measured by adding a luciferase substrate
to the lysate and measuring luminescence with a luminometer. For mGFP
expression detection, cells were visualized by using a fluorescence
microscope. Images were captured from multiple fields to ensure representative
sampling, and the fluorescence intensity was quantified using image
analysis software by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
of GFP-positive cells.

Cells were treated with varying concentrations
of siAR LNPs (5, 10, 20, and 40 nM siRNA) and mPTEN LNPs (62.5, 125,
250, and 500 ng/mL mRNA) individually to establish the dose–response
curves. For combination treatments, cells were cotreated with siRNA
and mRNA LNPs at all possible concentration combinations. LNPs were
incubated with the cells for 24 h, followed by medium replacement
and another 24 h incubation. Cell viability was measured using the
AlamarBlue assay. The synergistic effects of concurrent delivery were
evaluated using the Chou–Talalay method. Cell viability data from combination treatments were analyzed
by using CompuSyn software to calculate the CI. We adhered to the
standard approach for combination analysis, as recommended by Chou–Talalay,
and no modifications were made to the underlying principles or calculations
in the software. The CI shows the extent to which a given interaction
of drugs will produce a synergistic, addictive, or antagonistic result.
A CI value less than 1 indicates synergy; a value equal to 1 indicates
an additive effect; and a value greater than 1 indicates antagonism.

Live-cell
imaging was performed by using Calcein-AM staining. After treatment
with RNA LNPs, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 2 μM
Calcein-AM in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence images were
captured using a fluorescence microscope. The MFI of Calcein-AM was
quantified to assess the cell viability.

Apoptosis was also
evaluated using an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit. Treated
cells were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended
in binding buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/mL.
5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of PI were added to 100
μL of the cell suspension and then incubated for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark. Samples were then diluted with 400 μL
of binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h. Data
was collected for at least 10,000 events per sample, and the percentages
of viable, early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells were
determined using appropriate quadrants in the flow cytometry plots.

Cells were
lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined
using the BCA protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (20–30
μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred onto
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at
room temperature. They were then incubated overnight at 4 °C
with primary antibodies against AR, PTEN, pAKT, pERK, cleaved caspase-3,
and β-actin. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system and quantified using densitometry software.

Statistical
significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons.
Apvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. GraphPad Prism software was used for all statistical
analyses and graphing.

The optimization of the LNP formulation
was first conducted by varying the nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N:P) ratio
for both siRNA and mRNA delivery. Three N:P ratios (4, 5, and 6) were
tested by increasing the amount of ionizable lipid (MC3) while maintaining
a constant RNA amount. An optimal N:P ratio is critical for achieving
efficient encapsulation, protecting RNA, and effectively and safely
delivering RNA-encapsulated LNPs to target cells. The model luciferase
siRNA (siLuc) was chosen for the formulation of siLuc LNPs (FigureA). The average size
of the siLuc LNPs was approximately 100 nm, and no significant differences
were observed between N:P ratios of 4, 5, and 6 (FigureB). Cell viability analysis
showed that all siLuc LNP formulations had minimal cytotoxicity at
a concentration of 40 nM. Among the different N:P ratios, the ratio
of 4 resulted in the lowest cytotoxicity compared to higher ones,
yet the differences were not statistically significant (FigureC). Luciferase expression slightly
decreased as the N:P ratio increased, though siRNA silencing was efficient
at all the tested N:P ratios (FigureD). For mRNA delivery, the model green fluorescent
protein mRNA (mGFP) was chosen for testing the LNPs (FigureE). The average size of mGFP
LNPs was approximately 110 nm, and no significant differences were
noted among the tested N:P ratios (FigureF). Cell viability results demonstrated minimal
cytotoxicity across all mGFP LNP formulations (FigureG); however, an N:P ratio of 4 resulted in
the lowest cytotoxicity. Additionally, an N:P ratio of 4 showed roughly
2-fold higher GFP expression compared to ratios of 5 and 6, suggesting
better mRNA delivery (FigureH). This high GFP expression at an N:P ratio of 4 with similar
size, cell viability, and luciferase expression distinguished an N:P
ratio of 4 from a ratio of 5 or 6. Our data shows that an N:P ratio
of 4 was the optimal condition, which provides the best balance for
both efficient siRNA/mRNA delivery and minimal cytotoxicity.

Following N:P ratio screening, a library of 12 LNP formulations
was prepared for each siRNA and mRNA delivery by varying the composition
of two distinct ionizable lipids, DOPE, cholesterol, and DMG-PEG2000
to identify the optimal LNP formulation for siRNA and mRNA delivery
(Tables S1 and S2). The two ionizable lipids
examined were MC3 and SM-102, both of which have been clinically validated
for RNA delivery. MC3 was used in the LNP delivery system of the first
FDA-approved siRNA drug, Onpattro, while SM-102 was used as an ionizable
lipid in the mRNA LNP-based COVID-19 vaccine. For siRNA delivery,
the size of these siLuc LNP formulations ranged from ∼79 to
∼151 nm. As exhibited inFigureI, all siLuc LNP formulations demonstrated a high cell
viability. Luciferase silencing efficiency ranged from ∼63
to ∼80%, with MC3-4 showing the best silencing (FigureJ). Furthermore, siRNA encapsulation
efficiency (EE) ranged from ∼56 to ∼76%, with MC3-4
having an EE of ∼73% (Table S1).
These results indicate that all tested LNP formulations could effectively
deliver siRNA while maintaining a low cytotoxicity. Although the results
show minimal differences in luciferase silencing, this may reflect
the robustness of these formulations in delivering siRNA, while their
efficiency in mRNA delivery varies more significantly. For mRNA delivery,
the size of all mGFP LNP formulations ranged from ∼89 to ∼144
nm, and similar results were obtained with high cell viability for
these mGFP LNP formulations (FigureK). GFP expression analysis by fluorescence microscopy
revealed that MC3-4 and SM-102-6 achieved the highest levels of GFP
expression (FigureL,M). The mRNA EE for all formulations ranged from ∼86 to
∼94%, with MC3-4 having an EE of 94% (Table S2). Based on the combined analyses of cell viability, luciferase
silencing, GFP expression, and EE, the MC3-4 formulation emerged as
the optimal candidate for delivering both siRNA and mRNA, which consisted
of 13.5% DOPE, 50% MC3, 35% cholesterol, and 1.5% DMG-PEG2000. The
screening of different LNP formulations demonstrated that the lipid
composition plays a crucial role in determining the efficacy of RNA
delivery.

The concurrent treatment of siAR and mPTEN
LNPs in AR-positive and PTEN-null PCa cell lines, C4-2 and LNCaP,
was evaluated to determine the combined efficacy of AR inhibition
and PTEN restoration. We first tested the cytotoxicity for the combined
delivery of control siLuc LNPs and mGFP LNPs. The results demonstrated
that even at high concentrations (e.g., 40 nM for siLuc and 500 ng/mL
for mGFP), cell viability remained above 80% in both C4-2 and LNCaP
cell lines (Figure S1). This indicates
that the selected LNP formulations are biocompatible for studying
the in vitro antitumor effects of siAR and mPTEN LNPs. The siAR LNPs
and mPTEN LNPs (with an average size of ∼104 and ∼120
nm, respectively,Figure S2) were then
incubated with C4-2 and LNCaP cells for cell viability evaluation.

Individual dose–response experiments showed that siAR LNPs
had minimal cytotoxicity, with cell viability ranging from 93 to 97%
across different siAR concentrations (5–40 nM) for C4-2 cells
(FigureA). In contrast,
mPTEN LNPs exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, with low
cytotoxicity at 62.5 and 125 ng/mL (5.05% ± 3.71% and 9.83% ±
0.75%, respectively) but increased cell death at 250 and 500 ng/mL
(29.15% ± 5.75% and 53.40% ± 1.07%, respectively) (FigureB). When mPTEN LNPs
were coadministrated with siAR LNPs, there was a dose-dependent enhancement
of cytotoxicity compared to individual treatments (FigureC). For instance, at 250 ng/mL
mPTEN, cotreatment with 5, 10, 20, and 40 nM siAR reduced cell viability
to 69.3, 42.3, 23.1, and 18.3%, respectively, compared to 29.2% with
mPTEN alone, indicating significantly enhanced efficacy. The CI values
for different combinations of mPTEN and siAR were calculated, with
values below 1 indicating synergy and values below 0.5 indicating
strong synergy. The CI heatmap showed that mPTEN combined with siAR
resulted in strong synergy, particularly at higher doses of both components.
Notably, the best synergistic effect was observed with siAR at 20–40
nM and mPTEN at 250–500 ng/mL, with CI values of 0.23–0.39
(FigureD). This strong
synergistic effect at higher concentrations may be attributed to the
optimal balance between AR silencing and PTEN restoration. To further
investigate the synergistic effects between siAR LNPs and mPTEN LNPs,
the additive index (fadditive) as well
as the combination index (fcombination) were calculated using the reported method. Thefadditive=fsiAR×fmPTEN(fsiARis cell viability in the siAR LNP group, andfmPTENis cell viability in mPTEN LNP group),
while thefcombinationis cell viability
in siAR and mPTEN LNPs combination therapy.FigureE shows the comparison between the calculated
values offadditiveand that offcombination. It was observed that thefadditivevalues gradually exceeded thefcombinationvalues with increased mPTEN concentrations,
indicating a synergistic effect between siAR and mPTEN therapy. These
results confirm the hypothesis that concurrently addressing the restoration
of tumor suppressors and inhibition of tumorigenic drivers could lead
to a highly potent antitumor effect. Furthermore, similar results
were observed in LNCaP cells (Figure S3), where the combination of 20 nM siAR with 250 or 500 ng/mL mPTEN
led to cell death rates of 70.11% ± 9.35% and 84.25% ± 8.95%,
respectively, indicating consistency across both cell lines. While
the cell viability measurements and CI values demonstrate that the
40 nM siAR and 500 ng/mL mPTEN had the highest degree of cell killing
and synergy, for our subsequent studies, we chose to pursue siAR at
20 nM and mPTEN at 250 ng/mL to balance a high degree of synergistic
efficacy while retaining a sufficient number of viable cells for Western
blot and flow cytometry analyses.

To further study the potential enhanced cytotoxicity from the coadministration
of siAR and mPTEN LNPs, apoptosis induction was evaluated in C4-2
PCa cells. Representative bright field and Calcein-AM staining images
showed increased cell death with concurrent delivery of mPTEN and
siAR LNPs compared to single-agent treatments, as evidenced by the
decreased number of viable cells and reduced fluorescence signal (FigureA). Quantitative
analysis of the MFI of the Calcein-AM signal indicated a significantly
reduced live cell signal in the combination group, confirming enhanced
cytotoxicity (FigureB).

Flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V-FITC and PI staining was
also performed to assess apoptosis. The results showed a significant
increase in both early and late apoptotic cell populations in the
combination treatment group compared with single-agent treatments
(FigureC). Quantitative
analysis of apoptosis revealed that the percentage of early and late
apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the cotreatment group,
with over 60% of cells undergoing apoptosis, compared to minimal or
low apoptosis in the control and single-agent groups (FigureD). These results demonstrate
that the enhanced cytotoxicity observed with the concurrent treatment
of siAR and mPTEN LNPs is primarily due to the induction of much higher
apoptosis. The combination treatment effectively triggers both early
and late apoptosis, suggesting that the simultaneous inhibition of
AR and restoration of PTEN may disrupt key survival pathways, leading
to programmed cell death. These findings further support the synergistic
effect of the dual-targeting strategy and highlight its potential
as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of advanced
PCa.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying
the observed synergistic effect of the coadministration of siAR and
mPTEN LNPs, Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression
of key proteins involved in PCa cell survival and apoptosis (FigureA). Co-treatment
with siAR and mPTEN LNPs led to a marked decrease in AR, and the level
of PTEN expression was successfully restored, as evidenced by increased
PTEN protein levels. Phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and phosphorylated
ERK (pERK) levels were decreased, indicating effective suppression
of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inhibition of the ERK signaling
pathway, which are known to promote cell survival and proliferation
in PCa. The analysis also revealed increased levels of cleaved caspase-3
(c-Cas3), a marker of apoptosis, in the cotreatment group compared
to single-agent treatments, indicating enhanced apoptosis induction.

evaluation of siAR and mPTEN cotreatment in PCa cells.

in C4-2 cells treated with siAR LNP, mPTEN LNP, or siAR LNP + mPTEN
LNP. (B) Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of action
for coadministration of siAR and mPTEN LNPs.

The proposed mechanism of action for the coadministration of siAR
and mPTEN LNPs is shown inFigureB. AR silencing leads to decreased AR-mediated transcriptional
activity, while restoration of PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT
and ERK pathways. By concurrently restoring PTEN to inhibit the PI3K/AKT
pathway and silencing AR to inhibit the ERK pathway, we effectively
block two major survival routes, thereby preventing compensatory signaling
and enhancing proapoptotic responses through caspase-3 activation.
We define concurrent regulation as the simultaneous modulation of
two distinct cellular pathways that occur through different molecular
mechanisms, each operating on its own time scale. In our system, mPTEN
and siAR are coadministrated to achieve concurrent effects: restoration
of PTEN tumor suppressor function and inhibition of the AR tumorigenic
pathway in PCa cells. This dual-targeting approach effectively addresses
both oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressor deficiencies, providing
a comprehensive therapeutic effect against PCa.

We also compared the
efficacy of codelivery of siAR and mPTEN in
the same LNP to coadministration of siAR LNP and mPTEN LNP, using
siRNA and mRNA concentrations of 20 nM and 250 ng/mL, respectively.
First, we performed EE measurement experiments with model siLuc and
mGFP to confirm that each LNP contained the correct amount of siRNA
and mRNA. We found that the EE of siLuc and mGFP was 70.27 and 92.23%,
respectively, which is similar to the EE for each RNA in separate
LNPs, showing effective RNA complexation. The results are presented
inFigure S4, showing the cell viability
in both C4-2 and LNCaP. The cell death for the codelivery strategy
was 68.06% ± 5.32% and 70.90% ± 9.96% for C4-2 and LNCaP,
respectively. On the other hand, the cell death for the combination
treatment was 76.88% ± 11.62% and 70.11% ± 9.35% for C4-2
and LNCaP cells, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of both approaches
is comparable. These data suggest that LNP codelivery is a viable
alternative strategy for siAR and mPTEN cotreatment. Given that codelivery
in one particle may be beneficial for consistent pharmacokinetics
and biodistribution of multiple payloads and for maintaining their
synergistic ratio, the LNP codelivery
strategy may be adopted for future in vivo studies to test the antitumor
efficacy of concurrent AR silencing and PTEN restoration and their
synergistic effect.

This
study presents a novel approach to cancer therapy by concurrently
delivering siRNA and mRNA to silence pro-tumorigenic drivers and restore
tumor suppressor function. While concurrent siRNA and mRNA delivery
has been shown as proof-of-concept, this
study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report of concurrent
siRNA and mRNA therapy for cancer. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous
silencing of AR and restoration of PTEN exhibit a strong synergistic
effect in PCa cells. This strategy may also be robustly extended to
other tumorigenic drivers (e.g., MYC) and tumor suppressors (e.g.,
p53) in PCa and other cancer types, such as breast cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. With careful selection
of pro-tumorigenic and tumor-suppressing pathways, the versatility
of this codelivery system suggests broad applicability to various
cancers, potentially improving outcomes through precise modulation
of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways.

In our experiments,
we tested both the combined delivery of two
LNPs and codelivery with one LNP. While combined delivery may potentially
enable titration of the ratios of siRNA and mRNA in a more reproducible
and predictable manner, codelivery could have the advantage of overlapping
pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of both siRNA and mRNA. Additionally,
while concurrent siRNA and mRNA therapy could be highly effective
in vitro as demonstrated in this work, in vivo experiments (e.g.,
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and safety) are still
needed to further solidify it as a new viable strategy for cancer
treatment. Additionally, an in-depth understanding of the synergy
of siAR and mPTEN is still needed. To further clarify the mechanism
behind this synergistic effect, comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic
analyses will be needed, which may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic
targets.

In conclusion, our study provides strong evidence that
concurrent
delivery of siRNA to silence pro-tumorigenic drivers and mRNA to restore
tumor suppressors could achieve synergistic antitumor effects. This
RNA-based dual-targeting strategy holds significant potential for
developing more effective treatments for advanced PCa and possibly
other cancers. Future in vivo studies and a mechanistic understanding
may further validate and enhance this unique therapeutic approach
for its potential clinical development.
