This study presents MZ CUBE, a newly developed multipurpose phantom designed to assess both image quality and geometrical accuracy in image‐guided radiotherapy.

The phantom is a 16 × 16 × 16 cm3cube made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and designed to evaluate HU constancy, HU uniformity, spatial integrity, spatial resolution, low contrast resolution, and geometrical accuracy. Two CT simulators (Big Bore RT and Discovery RT Gen3) and two cone‐beam CT (CBCT) systems (XVI and OBI) were used for verification alongside commercial phantoms (ACR 464 and CatPhan 504).

HU constancy differences were within 3 HU, and uniformity was within 1 HU for CT and 2 HU for CBCT, based on repeated MZ CUBE measurements. Spatial resolution with the MZ CUBE was 7 lp/cm (Big Bore RT), 8 lp/cm (Discovery RT Gen3), 7 lp/cm (XVI), and 8 lp/cm (OBI). The minimum discernible disk diameters were 7, 5, 6, and 6 mm, respectively. Geometrical accuracy was confirmed with translational offsets below 1 mm and rotational deviations below 0.2° for both CBCT systems.

MZ CUBE enables comprehensive image quality and geometric accuracy evaluation in a single scan, offering an efficient and cost‐effective solution for radiotherapy QA.

Commercially available QA phantoms often assess image quality and geometrical accuracy separately, increasing the burden on clinical workflow and staff resources. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multipurpose phantom, the “MZ CUBE (Paprica Lab Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea)”, capable of assessing both geometrical accuracy and image quality.

This study presents the design, fabrication, and validation of the MZ CUBE phantom. Its clinical applicability was evaluated using two CT simulators and two CBCTs.

The phantom's main body was made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) for its lightweight and water‐equivalent properties,6and was fabricated using CNC milling. It has a cube shape (16 × 16 × 16 cm3) and weighs 4.24 kg. It consists of four modules: HU constancy/spatial integrity, spatial resolution, low contrast, and geometrical accuracy. Table1compares the specifications of the MZ CUBE with those of conventional QA phantoms.

A pre‐angled tilt plate was incorporated to introduce fixed rotational offsets. Figure1illustrates the phantom and its tilt plate configuration. Module‐specific design and validation details are provided in the following sections.

HU‐electron density consistency is vital for treatment planning and CBCT‐based adaptive RT.5,7,8The HU constancy module contains four 2.5‐cm‐diameter holes filled with acrylic, polyethylene, Teflon, and air, with respective electron densities of 0.004, 3.335, 3.833, and 6.243 (×1023/cm3). The same slice includes four 2‐mm holes spaced 10 cm apart, used to assess spatial integrity.

Spatial resolution was assessed using ten air‐filled line‐pair patterns (1–10 lp/cm). Low contrast was evaluated using holes (3–25 mm diameter) filled with VytaFlex 20 (Smooth‐On, Macungie, PA), a urethane polymer with low contrast to ABS. It was mixed 1:1, degassed, poured, and cured in the module. The geometrical accuracy module contains a 2‐mm Teflon ball and ten air‐filled ellipses aligned vertically and horizontally.

Once each module was produced, they were compressed, followed by painting, engraving, and inking. The exterior includes setup‐direction indicators, field‐size markers, and offset markers. The field‐size marker confirms a 10 × 10 cm2field at 100 cm SSD, with 1, 2, and 4 mm tolerance lines (Figure1a). Two offset markers were included: black for translation‐only (2.7, 2.4, 2.0 cm inx,y,z), and red for combined translation and rotation (1.0° yaw, 1.3° pitch, 0.8° roll). Rotational offsets were applied using the pre‐angled tilt plate.

Two CT and CBCT systems were evaluated. The CT systems were (1) Big Bore RT CT (Philips), which used 250 mAs with iDose, and (2) Discovery RT Gen3 (GE), which used 350 mAs with ASiR. The CBCT systems were (1) XVI on a Versa HD (Elekta AB), paired with the Big Bore RT CT and operated at 120 kVp, 132 mAs, using an F1 bow‐tie filter and FDK reconstruction, and (2) OBI on a TrueBeam STx (Varian Medical Systems), paired with the Discovery RT Gen3 and operated at 100 kVp, 150 mAs, using a half bow‐tie filter and standard reconstruction.

Image quality was evaluated by measuring deviations from baseline values,2,3which were re‐assessed after one week under identical conditions using MIM Software (v7.3.7; Cleveland, OH).

Spatial integrity was evaluated by measuring distances between 2‐mm holes in the HU constancy module.3,4After CT acquisition, the phantom origin was defined in the TPS (Monaco or Eclipse) and aligned using the offset marker. CBCT images were registered to the baseline CT (Figure2), and differences between known and measured offsets were recorded as positioning/repositioning errors.

Coincidence between imaging and treatment coordinates was assessed by aligning the phantom to room lasers and measuring the offset between the Teflon ball center and crosshair intersection.

The ACR 464 was used for Big Bore RT CT and XVI, and CatPhan 504 for Discovery RT and OBI, using the same scan parameters as MZ CUBE. Each phantom was measured twice under identical conditions for cross‐comparison. Geometrical accuracy was cross‐validated using the MIMI Phantom (Standard Imaging, Inc.), evaluating only translational offsets due to the absence of a HexaCheck module.

The phantom was placed at 100 cm SSD, and alignment of the 1, 2, and 4 mm tolerance markers was visually verified using a ruler with collimator settings of 10.1, 10.2, and 10.4 cm. The phantom's compatibility with four SGRT systems (AlignRT Gen5 and Horizon, ExacTrac Dynamic, and Catalyst+HD) was evaluated by importing CT datasets into each system and aligning the phantom to the treatment isocenter. Technical specifications are shown in Table2.

Figures3and4show the MZ CUBE modules acquired from the two CT simulators and two CBCT systems, with evaluation results compared to commercial phantoms summarized in Tables3. For HU constancy, differences between repeated measurements were within 3 HU across all systems. HU uniformity showed less than 1 HU variation in CT and up to 2 HU in CBCT. Spatial resolution and low‐contrast resolution matched the baseline values across all systems.

Tables3and4summarize image quality and geometrical accuracy results from MZ CUBE and commercial phantoms. HU differences between phantoms were generally within 10 HU, except for polyethylene and Teflon, where differences reached up to 30–60 HU. HU uniformity differences remained within 2 HU across all systems. Spatial resolution was comparable, except on Discovery RT Gen3, where CatPhan 504 achieved slightly higher resolution (10 lp/cm vs. 8 lp/cm). In low‐contrast resolution, MZ CUBE consistently detected smaller disks than the commercial phantoms, particularly on Big Bore RT and OBI CBCT.

A 10 × 10 cm field at 100 cm SSD was visually confirmed for both linacs. All SGRT systems successfully recognized and tracked the MZ CUBE phantom. System interface screenshots demonstrating successful surface recognition by each SGRT platform are shown in Figure5.

In this study, we developed the MZ CUBE phantom to enable integrated evaluation of both image quality and geometrical accuracy in IGRT, in accordance with the EFOMP‐ESTRO‐IAEA protocol.5Unlike conventional approaches requiring separate phantoms and multiple scans, MZ CUBE combines both functions into a single device, reducing scan time and setup effort. It is applicable to both CT and CBCT systems, and tilt plates allow assessment of 6D couch geometrical accuracy. While setup time may vary by user, the consolidated workflow using a single phantom can significantly reduce overall QA time.

For the low‐contrast module, previous studies used materials like PVC and Pinkysil silicone to slightly enhance contrast for low‐contrast evaluation.14,15In this study, VytaFlex was used for its similar contrast and moldability, enabling holes of various sizes. While the ACR 464 phantom has multiple low‐contrast holes, the large gap between 25 and 6 mm limits intermediate sensitivity. In contrast, the MZ CUBE includes 25–3 mm holes in finer steps, allowing detection of 6–7 mm disks and more precise evaluation across CBCT systems.

Geometrical accuracy methods vary by phantom design; some use full‐length rods or hollow spheres for alignment.17The MZ CUBE includes eight circular and elliptical holes arranged horizontally and vertically. Ellipses improve plane distinguishability over circular openings alone, enhancing alignment accuracy. Moreover, although the MZ CUBE was primarily developed for volumetric CT/CBCT QA, its centrally located circle is also visible on planar images, allowing for 2D–2D registration to verify setup accuracy.

This study has limitations. First, the MZ CUBE's cubic shape may cause non‐uniform attenuation and increased scatter near corners, unlike circular phantoms that ensure uniform path lengths during rotation. While this may affect consistency in acceptance testing, it has little impact on periodic QA focused on constancy. Second, the phantom does not support quantitative spatial resolution metrics like MTF, but remains suitable for routine QA using qualitative line patterns per AAPM TG‐142.

The MZ CUBE enables integrated CT and CBCT QA by assessing image quality and geometrical accuracy in a single scan, reducing reliance on separate phantoms. Its compatibility with four SGRT systems also supports its use in SGRT accuracy checks. Despite integrating multiple QA functions typically covered by separate commercial phantoms, the MZ CUBE remains cost‐competitive. It reduces QA‐related costs and streamlines logistics, offering a practical solution for diverse clinical settings.

We developed an integrated QA phantom compliant with the EFOMP‐ESTRO‐IAEA protocol that evaluates both image quality and geometrical accuracy in a single scan. Unlike conventional methods using separate phantoms, the MZ CUBE enables simultaneous assessment, providing time and cost efficiencies for radiotherapy QA.
