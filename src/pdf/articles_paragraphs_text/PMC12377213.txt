The advent of graphene catalyzed extensive exploration into two-dimensional (2D) materials, owing to their extraordinary electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Among these, two-dimensional silicon carbide (2D-SiC) has emerged as a compelling candidate for next-generation optoelectronic devices due to its inherent planar structure, robust mechanical strength, high exciton binding energy, high thermal stability, and wide band gap. In this work, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation into the effects of intrinsic point defects including vacancies and antisites as well as substitutional doping with various single foreign atom (e.g., As, Bi, Ga, Ge, In, P, Pb, Sb, Sn, Te, Ca, K, Mg) on the electronic and optical properties of 2D-SiC. Using density functional theory (DFT), we demonstrate that the direct band gap of pristine 2D-SiC is preserved in the presence of key defect types and dopants, affirming its suitability for efficient light-emitting applications. Building upon these findings, we propose a novel light-emitting diode (LED) architecture utilizing defect, doping-tailored 2D-SiC as the active emissive layer. Simulated optical and electrical performance metrics, including power spectral density, current–voltage characteristics, luminous power, light extraction efficiency, and CIE color coordinates, confirm the feasibility of achieving high-performance white light emission through strategic RGB color mixing. These findings confirm the capabilities of defect and dopant-engineered 2D-SiC as a high-performance material platform for adjustable light emission within the visible spectrum, which highlights its appropriateness for incorporation into cutting-edge optoelectronic devices and solid-state lighting applications.

DFT analysis reveals that defect and dopant engineered 2D-SiC retains a direct band gap, enabling efficient light emission. A proposed LED design achieves tunable white lightviaRGB mixing, highlighting 2D-SiC's promise for advanced optoelectronics.

The extraction of a single graphene layer from graphite in 20041marked a significant milestone in materials science, sparking a surge of interest in the exploration of additional two-dimensional (2D) materials. These fundamentally thin materials have attracted significant interest due to their remarkable physical, optical, and electronic properties.2–52D materials are highly desirable for next-generation technologies due to their exceptional characteristics, which make them ideal for applications in flexible electronics, nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics.6–10The unique features of these materials, such as lower scattering rates of charge carriers, improved carrier mobility, and higher conductivity, make them more effective than bulk silicon in the operation of electronic devices, which is fundamental to the modern semiconductor industry.11,12Despite graphene's remarkable properties, its intrinsic zero band gap remains a fundamental drawback for its use in nanoelectronics applications.13For a two-dimensional material to be viable in electronic devices, the presence of a finite and tunable band gap is crucial. To mitigate this constraint, many ways have been investigated to produce a band gap in graphene. Various strategies have been explored, including chemical doping, application of in-plane strain, surface functionalization (e.g., hydrogenation), and molecular adsorption.14–22In a research, Deniset al.23demonstrated that the incorporation of substitutional impurities including aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur into monolayer and bilayer graphene may successfully induce a band gap.

2D-SiC has gotten a lot of attention as a possible base for nano-electronic and optoelectronic devices because it is very thermally stable, strong, has a wide bandgap, and allows carriers to move easily. So far, most theoretical investigations have focused on the electrical and optical properties of monolayer 2D-SiC. Singhet al.47used HSE06 simulations to get very accurate measurements of the electrical and optical characteristics of pristine monolayer SiC. Recent advancements have been achieved in the synthesis of two-dimensional SiC structures within the experimental domain. Linet al.48effectively created quasi-two-dimensional SiC flakes with thicknesses under 10 nm by facilitating a reactive interaction between silicon quantum dots and graphene. Despite the quasi-2D-SiC flakes not being atomically thin, the authors noted alterations in the electrical structure indicated of quantum confinement. Further advancement was achieved by Chabiet al.,49who utilized a catalyst-free carbothermal reduction method to produce 2D-SiC nanoflakes with average lateral dimensions around 2 μm and thicknesses reduced to approximately 2–3 nm, corresponding to about seven to ten atomic layers. Yanget al.50used the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach to create multi-layer 2D-SiC films and ultra-thin 2D-SiC layers (8–10 nm thick). Through the use of a wet exfoliation technique, Chabiet al.were able to successfully revive 2D-SiC from hexagonal SiC.29A recent study by Polleyet al.51highlighted the successful growth of a large-area, atomically thin epitaxial monolayer of SiC featuring a honeycomb lattice using the “bottom-up” solid state fabrication technique. The findings indicate that, in contrast to numerous other 2D materials that experience environmental instability, this experimentally synthesized 2D-SiC monolayer exhibits environmental stability and remains intact at room temperature. At the same time, there have been significant improvements in defect and dopant engineering, as well as the integration of several types of 2D materials for optoelectronic uses including light-emitting devices.52–55The results show that the configurations studied in this study can be used in real life, and they also give a good reason for more theoretical research on 2D-SiC-based LED.

Ion implantation is a well-established and precise technique widely used for doping in semiconductor materials. This approach involves the acceleration and precise direction of dopant ions into the host lattice, specifically two-dimensional silicon carbide, facilitating meticulous placement at designated lattice sites.56The concentration and distribution of dopants can be precisely controlled through ion implantation, a recognized technique for selective doping in semiconductors. The introduction of dopant precursors during the development phase of CVD enables the generation of doped two-dimensional SiC layers.44,57,58This method not only proves to be optimal for large-scale manufacturing but also facilitates uniform doping throughout the process.

Defects such as dopants, vacancies, antisites, and interstitials are recognized for their essential influence in substantially modifying the electronic and optical properties of 2D materials. The significant quantum confinement in two-dimensional systems leads to a notable difference in the interaction between defected and host wave functions compared to what is seen in bulk three-dimensional materials. Heet al.59and Bezi Javan60looked at how isolated point defects and light-element dopants like nitrogen and boron affect magnetic characteristics and localized electronic states. There hasn't been enough research on how different types of intrinsic defects, like vacancies and antisites, and a variety of substitutional dopants affect the optical transitions and emission properties of 2D-SiC. This study presents a thorough first-principles examination of the electronic, and optical characteristics associated with different defect types in a monolayer of SiC. Utilizing first principle DFT, we conduct a thorough examination of the impacts of intrinsic point defects, including vacancies and anti-sites, alongside substitutional doping with foreign atoms such arsenic (As), bismuth (Bi), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), indium (In), phosphorus (P), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), tellurium (Te), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg). In addition, we explore more complex defect configurations involving coupled defect types, such as vacancy-dopant and antisite-vacancy pairs. This thorough examination provides important insights into the impact of different defects on the electronic and optical properties of 2D-SiC, emphasizing its potential for advanced device applications like light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A foundational objective of this study is to evaluate how vacancy and anti-site defects, along with substitutional doping, affect the band structure of 2D-SiC. Determining monolayers that maintain a direct band gap through these modifications is essential for efficient photon emission, which is a necessary condition for LED technology. Based on our findings, a novel LED architecture is proposed where defect-modified 2D-SiC acts as the primary emissive layer.

2D-SiC, a lot of work has been done on other two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), black phosphorus (BP), and 2D perovskites, to make light-emitting technologies for the next generation.61–63These materials have changeable optical bandgaps, strong excitonic effects, and high quantum efficiencies. Yuet al.64showed that localized strain fields could be used to precisely tune the spectra of single-photon emitters in WSe2monolayers. However, these strain-engineering methods often need complicated fabrication processes, which limits their ability to be used in larger integrated devices. Shenget al.65showed that using high-quality CVD-grown 2D materials, they made an asymmetric structure of monolayer WS2. This structure made red-light-emitting LEDs that worked well and could be seen glowing under both forward and reverse bias. This method shows that optoelectronic platforms based on 2D materials are becoming more and more possible.

Graphene and TMDs are 2D materials that are used as functional interlayers and dopants in real-world LED designs like OLEDs, QLEDs, and PeLEDs. These materials make it easier for charges to enter, change work functions, and stop excitons from dying, which all make devices last longer and work better.70Even if the results in several two-dimensional systems are promising, 2D-SiC has not been fully studied for emission tuning and white-light generation using systematic defect or doping procedures.

Earlier simulation endeavors, including those conducted by Islamet al.showed effective blue light emission through the development of a 2D-SiC-based multi-quantum well structure utilizing SILVACO TCAD tools.71The design utilized 4H-SiC as the quantum barrier and GaN as the electron-blocking layer, aiming to improve carrier confinement and recombination efficiency. In a similar vein, Rashidet al.introduced an LED model that incorporates 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC layers, assessing performance metrics including luminous power, current–voltage behavior, and spectral characteristics under different structural conditions.72Expanding upon these established frameworks, we employed monolayer pure 2D-SiC, defected 2D-SiC, and doped 2D-SiC as active layers in the proposed LED to determine their emission characteristics within the visible red, green, and blue spectrum. This study uses first-principles DFT calculations and TCAD-based device modeling to look at how inherent point defects and substitutional doping affect the optoelectronic properties of monolayer 2D-SiC. This work looks at different types of intrinsic point defects and different types of substitutional point dopants in a systematic way to figure out how they change the electronic band structure and optical absorption properties. Through a color mixing approach, we proposed that integrating these individual red, green, and blue LEDs into a single chip could enable white light emission. This design shows that defect- and dopant-engineered 2D-SiC can be used as a tunable, stable, and scalable base for future solid-state lighting applications. Furthermore, we analyzed the power spectral density, light extraction efficiency, luminous power, CIE chromaticity coordinates, and current–voltage characteristics of the proposed LED, providing comprehensive insight into its optical and electrical performance.

We used the GGA-PBE functional and the independent-particle approximation to figure out the optical properties, which include the imaginary part of the dielectric function and the absorption spectra. It is well known that GGA functionals usually underestimate bandgaps and leave out interactions between electrons and holes. This method is a useful and reliable way to test a lot of different point defect and dopant setups. The bandgap for pristine 2D-SiC was found to be 2.57 eV, which is in line with the experimental results reported by Polleyet al.51and with the results of earlier theoretical investigations that used hybrid functionals.47This constancy comes from a balancing act: the PBE's underestimating of the bandgap is offset by the fact that excitonic binding is not included in the optical spectra. This makes the absorption onset a good estimate. Using GW+BSE or hybrid functionals with time-dependent DFT to make more precise computations would give better estimates of excitonic transitions, radiative lifetimes, and optical sensitivity.

The GGA-PBE functional was also used in this study to look at the electrical characteristics of both pristine and modified 2D-SiC. The estimated bandgap for pristine monolayer 2D-SiC is 2.57 eV, which is quite close to what was found in experiments51,82,83and supports earlier hybrid functional calculations.47This agreement confirms that the procedure is consistent and supports its usage for systematically looking at different point defect and dopant setups. The band structure of pristine 2D-SiC, determined using HSE06, is presented in the electrical results section.

This work looks at how intrinsic point defects and substitutional dopants affect 2D-SiC. All of the defect and dopant configurations were put in on purpose to make the situations seem authentic. Engineering materials at the atomic level is a common way to improve the properties of semiconductors for use in optoelectronic applications.84–86The choice of point defects and dopants is based on theory and backed up by experiments.87–92We looked at intrinsic defects including silicon vacancy (VSi), carbon vacancy (VC), silicon–carbon divacancy (VSiC), and antisite defects like SiC, CSi, and Si ↔ C. Defects in SiC often happen when it grows in a non-stoichiometric way, when it is ion irradiated, when it is thermally annealed, or when it is treated with plasma. Existence has been shown to be present in bulk and two-dimensional SiC systems, affecting electronic structure, trap states, and radiative recombination, as shown in previous research.93,94Point defects can also be intentionally introduced to tailor the electrical and optical properties of the material.

A single carbon vacancy, denoted as VC, was introduced into the monolayer SiC structure by removing one carbon atom, as illustrated inFig. 1(b). Similarly, a silicon vacancy (VSi) was created by removing a single Si atom from the lattice, as shown inFig. 1(c). To investigate more complex defect structures, two types of double vacancies were also considered. The removal of two carbon atoms resulted in the formation of a double carbon vacancy, V2C(Fig. 1(d)), while the removal of two silicon atoms produced a double silicon vacancy, V2Si(Fig. 1(e)). A combined vacancy involving the simultaneous removal of one silicon and one carbon atom led to the formation of a dual vacancy labeled as VSiC, as shown inFig. 1(f).

Antisite defects were also examined in this study. Replacing a silicon atom with a carbon atom yielded the antisite defect CSi(Fig. 1(g)), while substituting a carbon atom with a silicon atom formed the SiCdefect (Fig. 1(h)). The exchange of positions between neighboring silicon and carbon atoms resulted in a double antisite defect, designated as Si ↔ C, as depicted inFig. 1(i).

We chose thirteen substitutional dopants because their atomic size is compatible with silicon, their electronegativity is different, and they have been shown to work in similar materials in experiments. These dopants include As, Bi, Ga, Ge, P, Pb, Sb, Sn, In, Te, Ca, K, and Mg, producing the respective configurations: AsSi, BiSi, GaSi, GeSi, PSi, PbSi, SbSi, SnSi, InSi, TeSi, CaSi, KSi, and MgSi, as illustrated inFig. 2(a)–(m). Additionally, nitrogen and boron doping were achieved by replacing a carbon atom with one nitrogen or one boron atom, resulting in NC(Fig. 2(n)) and BC(Fig. 2(o)), respectively. Phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are all group V elements. Gallium, indium, and boron are all group III elements. To broaden the chemical range and see how they affect localized electronic states and light emission, calcium, magnesium, potassium, tellurium, bismuth, lead, and tin were added. Researchers have added a lot of dopants to SiC, GaN, and ZnO using methods like ion implantation, molecular beam epitaxy, and chemical vapor deposition. Phosphorus and arsenic are known to provide shallow donor levels in 4H-SiC,95,96while gallium and indium have been used to make SiC and ZnO p-type conductors.97,98High-temperature growth and implantation have made it possible to dope magnesium and calcium.99,100Bismuth and tellurium have been used to change the optoelectronic properties of chalcogenide semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.101,102The types of defects and dopants used for this study are a good mix of what can be done with computers and what is useful in experiments. This choice gives us a strong basis for looking at how 2D-SiC can be changed for possible uses in solid-state lighting.

In this work, we propose a novel LED structure employing 2D SiC as an active layer under three different conditions: pristine, defect-engineered, and doped. The performance of this LED is strongly influenced by the band gap of the 2D SiC layer. Our proposed 2D SiC-based LED may be manufactured by integrating epitaxial growth,103a solid-state joining process,104with diffusion bonding,105a state-of-the-art methodology for constructing SiC devices.106Fig. 3shows the basic schematic diagram of the proposed structure. To model the fabrication process, we considered the diffusion welding technique, which involves applying high temperature and pressure to bond thick wafers of different materials. As illustrated inFig. 4, this method is used to join two dissimilar material wafers under elevated thermal and mechanical conditions. Following this concept, we performed microscale simulations of the proposed SiC-based single quantum well (SQW) LED structure using various 2D SiC active layers. These simulations were carried out using the SILVACO TCAD software suite.

In our simulated device, we have implemented the diffusion welding approach to directly link the N-type 4H-SiC thick wafer, rather than using epitaxial layers for deposition. Following this, a thin intrinsic layer of two-dimensional silicon carbide (2D SiC) in its pristine, doped, or defect-engineered form was deposited onto the N-type 4H-SiC substrate to form a layered structure. In the last stage, consisting of an N-type 4H-SiC and an intrinsic epilayer, was combined with a thick P-type 4H-SiC wafer using the same method as the diffusion bonding strategy. The simulated light-emitting diode has been constructed using heavily doped P-type and N-type 4H-SiC layers, with concentrations of 1 × 1018cm−3because it is a standard value used in high-performance SiC optoelectronic devices. The concentrations are in line with what is usually achieved using experimental methods like ion implantation orin situdoping during chemical vapor deposition (CVD).107,108After that, the dopants are activated by high-temperature annealing at temperatures above 1600 °C. Adding phosphorus and nitrogen to 4H-SiC has made it N-type doped, with carrier concentrations between 1017and 1019cm−3, as shown in studies of implantation and diffusion.95,96,109Using hot-wall CVD techniques, it has been shown that P-type doping with aluminum can reach similar levels.110,111The concentration of doping has a big effect on how well a device works. Higher doping levels improve carrier injection and conductivity, which lowers series resistance. But this can also cause more free-carrier absorption, Auger recombination, and band tailing linked to dopants, all of which could make it harder to get light out. On the other hand, lower doping concentrations may help with light extraction, but they often make carrier injection and current density lower. The chosen concentration of 1 × 1018cm−3strikes a good balance between improving electrical qualities and making sure there is a lot of visual output.

A variety of appropriate physical models relevant to LEDs were applied in the simulations. The POLARIZATION command within the MODEL statement of SILVACO TCAD was used to implement and activate the polarization model effectively. Carrier mobilities in the simulation were clearly shown for the bulk 4H-SiC and monolayer 2D-SiC areas. The Caughey–Thomas equation was used to simulate the mobility of P-type and N-type 4H-SiC layers, which depends on the amounts of doping.112,113The degradation of mobility in 4H-SiC layers due to doping was modeled using the Caughey–Thomas empirical relation, which is automatically activated upon enabling CONMOB. This approach is often used for SiC-based devices, and experiments show that it works. In the 2D-SiC active layer, constant values of electron and hole mobilities were utilized, based on the first-principles results obtained from our calculations. The values are displayed inTable 1.

In this study, we used advanced physical models from Silvaco Atlas to precisely represent how the LED structure behaves when light is present. The Fermi model could use Fermi–Dirac statistics for carrier distributions, which is more accurate than Boltzmann statistics, especially when there is a lot of doping or the temperature is low. The consrh model is used in SILVACO TCAD included Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, which takes into consideration trap-assisted electron–hole recombination through defect states in the bandgap. To look at non-radiative recombination at high carrier densities, the auger model was turned on. This made it possible to model energy transfer from recombining carriers to a third carrier instead of photon emission. The optr model added optical recombination mechanisms, which made it possible to model radiative processes that are important for light emission in LEDs. Also, spontaneous emission was thought to be able to catch photon production from direct electron–hole recombination. We employed the Lorentz model to account for spectral broadening in the emitted light. We applied a Lorentzian line shape to make the device's emission spectrum look like it really is. These models worked together to make sure that the LED's transport, recombination, and emission phenomena were all fully and physically true.

Fig. 5(a)illustrates that the pristine 2D SiC possesses a direct bandgap, with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) located at theKpoint. The calculated bandgap for the pristine structure is 2.57 eV, which aligns well with values reported in previous studies.44To investigate the impact of vacancy defects on the electronic structure, several defect configurations were considered, as shown inFig. 5(b)–(f). The carbon vacancy (VC) was introduced by removing a single carbon atom from the relaxed 4 × 4 × 1 supercell. The resulting structure exhibits an indirect bandgap of 1.13 eV, with transitions occurring between theMandKpoints, as shown inFig. 5(b). The silicon vacancy (VSi) configuration, formed by removing one silicon atom, exhibits an indirect bandgap of 2.21 eV, with the CBM located at theKpoint and the VBM at theΓpoint (Fig. 5(c)).

For divacancy configurations, the carbon divacancy (V2C), obtained by removing two carbon atoms, shows an indirect bandgap of 0.9531 eV with the CBM atΓand the VBM atK[Fig. 5(d)]. The silicon divacancy (V2Si), formed by removing two silicon atoms, reveals a direct bandgap of 0.64 eV at theΓpoint [Fig. 5(e)]. The silicon–carbon divacancy (VSiC), formed by simultaneously removing one silicon and one carbon atom, exhibits an indirect bandgap of 0.95 eV, with the CBM atΓand the VBM atK[Fig. 5(f)].

Antisite defects were also explored by substituting a silicon atom with a carbon atom (CSi), a carbon atom with a silicon atom (SiC), and by interchanging the positions of a silicon and a carbon atom (Si ↔ C). The corresponding electronic band structures are depicted inFig. 5(g)–(i). The CSiand Si ↔ C configurations both show direct bandgaps at theKpoint, with calculated values of 1.99 eV and 1.41 eV, respectively. In contrast, the SiCstructure presents an indirect bandgap of 2.00 eV, with the CBM atΓand the VBM atK.

The effects of substitutional doping at the silicon site were examined using elements such as As, Bi, Ga, Ge, In, P, Pb, Sb, Sn, Te, Ca, K, and Mg.Fig. 6(a)–(m)show the band structures of these doped configurations. Dopants including As, Ga, In, Pb, Sn, Ca, K, and Mg yield direct bandgaps at theKpoint. The respective bandgap values are 1.96 eV (AsSi), 2.50 eV (GaSi), 2.47 eV (InSi), 2.50 eV (PbSi), 1.38 eV (SnSi), 1.84 eV (CaSi), 2.48 eV (KSi), and 2.31 eV (MgSi). In contrast, Bi, Ge, and Sb dopants result in indirect bandgaps, where the CBM is located atΓand the VBM atK. The corresponding bandgaps are 2.00 eV (BiSi), 2.51 eV (GeSi), and 2.01 eV (SbSi), as shown inFig. 6(b), (d) and (h), respectively.

Doping at the carbon site with nitrogen (NC) and boron (BC) were also analyzed. The NCstructure shows an indirect bandgap of 2.54 eV with the CBM atΓand the VBM atK(Fig. 6(n)), whereas the BCconfiguration yields a direct bandgap of 2.14 eV at theKpoint (Fig. 6(o)).

The effective mass of charge carriers is a key parameter in semiconductors, as it directly influences the carrier mobility and, consequently, affects the photoelectric and thermoelectric performance of the material.114In this section, we report the calculated effective masses of electrons and holes for pristine and defect-engineered 2D-SiC, for which, to the best of our knowledge, no prior comprehensive data exist.

The effective masses of holes and electrons were estimated by performing second-order parabolic fitting of curves at the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum, respectively. Effective masses of carriers:wherem* denotes the effective mass,his the Planck constant,E(k) is the energy as a function of wave vectork. The effective masses are normalized with respect to the free electron massm0.

The relaxation periodτfor semiconductor solids generally ranges from 10−13to 10−14.112,118–121In this work, the mobility computation has utilized a value ofτof 10−13.

To investigate the impact of structural defects on charge carrier transport, we extended our calculations to various defect and doping configurations. The effective masses and carrier mobility were calculated for both defective and doped 2D-SiC systems, specifically focusing on those configurations that exhibit a direct band gap. The extracted values are summarized inTable 1.

This section presents a detailed examination of the optical characteristics of pristine 2D SiC and its variations incorporating point defects and dopants. The examination highlights essential parameters relevant to optoelectronic applications, such as the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, refractive index, absorption coefficient, and electron energy loss function.

The absorption spectra don't include excitonic corrections, which are known to affect how two-dimensional materials respond optically. Even though this is a problem, we still want to compare how different defect and dopant systems affect optical behavior. The predicted optical gap for pure 2D-SiC is about 2.6 eV, which is in line with experimental photoluminescence measurements. This shows that PBE is enough for looking at qualitative trends. The good agreement is probably due to the fact that the computed spectra don't include exciton binding energy and the bandgap underestimate was canceled.

The complex dielectric function is defined asε(ω) =ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), whereε1(ω) represents the real part, andε2(ω) denotes the imaginary part.122,123The behavior of the real part of the dielectric function,ε1(ω), offers critical insights into how light interacts with SiC, particularly in terms of its propagation characteristics and electronic polarizability. The real part of the dielectric function,ε1(ω) reflects how the material responds to incident electromagnetic waves, governing both dispersion and energy storage in the system. The low-frequency or long wavelengths limit ofε1(ω) asωapproaches 0 indicates a relatively high static dielectric constant of about 3.9, suggesting significant polarization effects in the in-plane direction of the pristine SiC, as shown inFig. 7(a). This high value suggests robust dielectric screening and pronounced responsiveness to external fields. Across the visible spectrum, from roughly 850 nm down to 480 nm,ε1(ω) displays a gradual increase in magnitude, peaking near 410 nm. This trend implies enhanced optical activity and a resonant interaction with photons in this range. A decrease inε1(ω) is observed with a further reduction in wavelength, indicating enhanced light–matter interaction and a possible increase in optical absorption processes. This parameter turned negative in the ultraviolet (UV) region, implying a potential for plasmonic behavior in that region. Moreover, the presence of distinct peaks inε1(ω) corresponds to allowed interband transitions, likely originating from energy states near Van Hove singularities in the electronic band structure.123These optical transitions highlight the intrinsic anisotropy and dipole-allowed excitations within the material. Taken together, the high static dielectric response, strong visible-range activity, and spectral features ofε1(ω) affirm that SiC is a promising platform for optoelectronic applications, particularly those operating in the infrared and visible regimes.

In the case of single vacancy defects, the carbon vacancy (VC) configuration demonstrates a relatively highε1(ω) value at low frequencies, indicating enhanced dielectric screening and elevated electronic polarizability, as illustrated inFig. 7(b). Conversely, the silicon vacancy (VSi) configuration exhibits a negativeε1(ω) value, suggestive of metallic or plasmonic behavior, as depicted inFig. 7(b).

Double vacancy structures, including V2C, V2Si, and VSiC, exhibit elevatedε1(ω) values in the low-frequency regime, as illustrated inFig. 7(d)–(f), reflecting pronounced static polarizability and effective dielectric screening at long wavelengths. As the excitation wavelength decreases,ε1(ω) transitions to negative values, indicating the onset of plasmonic behavior and a metallic-like optical response at higher photon energies. The transition from robust dielectric properties in the infrared and visible spectra to negative permittivity in the ultraviolet spectrum highlights the promise of these defect-engineered 2D-SiC for adjustable optoelectronic and plasmonic uses.

Antisite defects exhibit distinct dielectric behavior depending on the atomic configuration. The CSidefect shows a negativeε1(ω) value at very long wavelengths, indicating a metallic or plasmonic optical response, as shown inFig. 7(g). In contrast, the SiCand Si ↔ C configurations demonstrate highε1(ω) values in the same spectral range, suggesting enhanced static dielectric screening and elevated in-plane polarizability, as presented inFig. 7(h) and (i), respectively.

Doping significantly alters the dielectric response of 2D-SiC. In particular, dopant configurations such as AsSi(Fig. 8(a)), BiSi(Fig. 8(b)), GeSi(Fig. 8(d)), PSi(Fig. 8(f)), SbSi(Fig. 8(h)), SnSi(Fig. 8(i)), TeSi(Fig. 8(j)), and NC(Fig. 8(n)) exhibit notably high values of the real part of the dielectric function,ε1(ω), in the low-frequency or long-wavelength regime. This behavior indicates strong static polarizability and efficient dielectric screening, underscoring the doped structures' responsiveness to external electric fields in this spectral region. At higher energies, particularly within the ultraviolet range,ε1(ω) transitions to negative values. This shift suggests the onset of plasmonic activity and a metallic-like optical response. The observed transition from a high positive dielectric constant at low energies to negative values at higher excitation energies reveals the potential of these doped SiC systems for tunable optoelectronic and plasmonic applications.

In contrast, doped configurations such as GaSi(Fig. 8(c)), InSi(Fig. 8(e)), PbSi(Fig. 8(g)), CaSi(Fig. 8(k)), KSi(Fig. 8(l)), MgSi(Fig. 8(m)), and BC(Fig. 8(o)) exhibit negative values of the real part of the dielectric function,ε1(ω), in the long-wavelength or low-frequency region. This behavior suggests a response similar to metallic or plasmonic characteristics, potentially arising from oscillations of free carriers or low-energy collective excitations. Furthermore, GaSi, InSi, PbSi, and CaSiconfigurations display positiveε1(ω) values within the shorter visible wavelength range, while KSi, MgSi, and BCshow sustained positive values across a broader region of the visible spectrum. The continued presence of positive permittivity in the visible range further confirms the semiconducting nature of these materials, strengthening their applicability in optoelectronic and photonic devices.

The imaginary part of the dielectric function,ε2(ω), is closely associated with the optical absorption characteristics of a material. It indicates the extent to which light is absorbed when it interacts with the material. As such,ε2(ω) provides valuable insight into the electronic bandgap, which is linked to the energy of interband transitions occurring near the Fermi level. These transitions significantly influence the absorption properties of the material.Fig. 9(a)presents the variation ofε2(ω) for pristine SiC. As shown in the graph, several prominent peaks appear near the energies corresponding to band transitions. Notably, the main absorption peak for pristine SiC occurs at a wavelength of around 380 nm. There has some prominent peak in UV region. This peak corresponds to strong interband transitions near the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and reflects a high joint density of states.

For single vacancy defects, the carbon vacancy (VC) configuration exhibits a relatively low value of the imaginary part of the dielectric function,ε2(ω), in the high wavelength range, indicating minimal optical absorption in the infrared and near-visible regions, as shown inFig. 9(b). In contrast, the silicon vacancy (VSi) configuration demonstrates a significantly higherε2(ω) response within the same spectral range, as shown inFig. 9(c). The significant absorption observed at low photon energies indicates strong optical transitions close to the band edge, probably due to notable excitonic.

Double vacancy structures, including V2C, V2Si, and VSiC, exhibit non-zero value of the imaginary part of the dielectric function,ε2(ω), in the high wavelength region, as shown inFig. 9(d)–(f), respectively. This behavior indicates increased optical activity at photon energies below the bandgap of the pristine material, which is likely due to the presence of localized defect states within the bandgap. These configurations also display notable absorption peaks in the ultraviolet and visible regions, reflecting strong defect-related optical transitions. The observation of these peaks indicates that double vacancies create optically active defect states in the bandgap, potentially enabling radiative recombination processes. Similarly, antisite defect configurations such as CSi, SiC, and the Si ↔ C exchange defect also show a non-zeroε2(ω) response in the high-wavelength region, further indicating sub-bandgap optical activity, as shown inFig. 9(g) and (h). While all three defects exhibit pronounced absorption features in the ultraviolet region, the Si ↔ C configuration additionally shows significant absorption peaks in the visible range. The results indicate that double vacancies and antisite defects play a crucial role in affecting the optical characteristics of 2D-SiC, offering potential for the regulating of its optoelectronic properties for specific applications.

Doped SiC structures such as GeSi, SnSi, TeSi, and NCexhibit an imaginary part of the dielectric function,ε2(ω), that remains close to zero, as shown inFig. 10(d), (i), (j) and (n), respectively. This behavior reflects the wide bandgap nature of the material and the absence of low-energy electronic transitions. In contrast, dopants such as AsSi(Fig. 10(a)), BiSi(Fig. 10(b)), GaSi(Fig. 10(c)), InSi(Fig. 10(e)), PSi(Fig. 10(f)), PbSi(Fig. 10(g)), SbSi(Fig. 10(h)), CaSi(Fig. 10(k)), KSi(Fig. 10(l)), MgSi(Fig. 10(m)), and BC(Fig. 10(o)) result in a pronounced increase inε2(ω), indicating the formation of additional electronic states within or near the bandgap. These states promote optical transitions at sub-bandgap energies, leading to enhanced absorption in the low-photon-energy region. A significant rise inε2(ω) is observed at shorter wavelengths, with a strong absorption peak evident in the ultraviolet region for all doped configurations. This peak is attributed to interband transitions occurring near high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone.

The refractive index serves as an essential optical parameter, detailing the propagation of light through a material and shaping its interaction with electromagnetic radiation. The refractive index of 2D-SiC is indicating of its intrinsic electronic structure and the robust in-plane bonding that exists between silicon and carbon atoms. The refractive index of 2D-SiC in its pristine, defect, and doped form is notably high within the visible spectrum, as illustrated inFig. 11and12, varying with photon energy and polarization direction. The increased refractive index suggests a significant electronic polarizability and is closely associated with its moderate direct band gap and strong optical absorption across the ultraviolet to visible spectrum. The optical response of 2D-SiC exhibits increased tunability, attributed to its reduced dimensionality and interactions that are dominated by the surface. We can see that inFig. 11and12, the refractive index is influenced by structural modifications such as defects and single atom doping, presenting opportunities to tailor its optical characteristics for specific applications. These properties make 2D-SiC a promising candidate for integration in nanoscale photonic and optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes.

The absorption coefficient of pristine 2D-SiC, as shown inFig. 13(a), becomes non-zero at the onset of the wavelength range, indicating the beginning of optical absorption from the visible region. This behavior corresponds to the material's bandgap of approximately 2.57 eV. The position and intensity of the absorption peaks are influenced by both the electronic band structure and lattice vibrations. The absorption edge is primarily determined by the bandgap energy, while the peak positions are also affected by excitonic interactions. A notable absorption maximum occurs near 180 nm.

Symmetry within the crystal structure plays a critical role in governing the selection rules for optical transitions. Materials with higher symmetry often restrict allowed transitions, resulting in fewer or weaker absorption features. Conversely, lower-symmetry structures can relax these selection rules, enabling stronger or more numerous optical transitions. In the case of 2D-SiC, the reduced symmetry permits enhanced optical transitions, which manifest as several strong absorption peaks in both the ultraviolet and visible regions. Furthermore, strong excitonic effects in 2D-SiC contribute to the appearance and shifting of these prominent absorption features.

The optical absorption spectra shown inFig. 13and14clearly reveal that defective SiC monolayers exhibit redshifted absorption onsets relative to the pristine monolayer. This redshift in absorption is primarily attributed to defect-induced states within the bandgap, which effectively narrow the optical gap. In the cases of vacancy type defects as shownFig. 13(b)–(f), absorption starting from higher wavelengths (0 eV), resulting in metallic-like behavior. On the other hand, antisite type defects (Fig. 13(g) and (h)) where defect states are situated close to the CBM or VBM, the absorption spectra remain largely similar to the pristine monolayer with the first absorption peaks appearing in the visible range.

For doped SiC systems such as AsSi(Fig. 14(a)), BiSi(Fig. 14(b)), GeSi(Fig. 14(d)), PSi(Fig. 14(f)), PbSi(Fig. 14(g)), SbSi(Fig. 14(h)), and SnSi(Fig. 14(i)) the absorption spectra remain largely similar to the pristine monolayer and their initial absorption peaks also lie in the visible region. In contrast, the doped SiC structures such as GaSi(Fig. 14(c)), InSi(Fig. 14(e)), TeSi(Fig. 14(j)), CaSi(Fig. 14(k)), KSi(Fig. 14(l)), MgSi(Fig. 14(m)), NC(Fig. 14(n)) and BC(Fig. 14(o)) absorption starting from higher wavelengths (0 eV), resulting in metallic-like behavior. These structures also exhibit strong absorption peaks within the visible spectrum.

The observed strong absorption in the visible region highlights the potential of these defective and doped SiC structures for applications in solar-driven photocatalysis and visible-light LEDs. Additionally, the presence of absorption peaks in the IR region indicates suitability for IR LEDs, with potential uses in communication, sensing, and remote-control devices. The wide absorption coverage spanning UV, visible, and IR regions further highlights the applicability of these materials in diverse optoelectronic technologies.

The electron loss function (ELF) represents the amount of energy lost by electrons as they pass through a dielectric material. It provides critical information about the material's electronic structure, especially regarding energy dissipation and collective excitations such as plasmons. The peak positions and their intensities in the ELF spectrum reflect various electronic transitions and are closely related to the bandgap of the material. The ELF can be derived from the dielectric function using the standard relation involving the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant.

Fig. 15(a)presents the ELF for pristine 2D SiC. A strong peak appears near 105 nm, indicating a significant energy loss due to plasmon resonance. This feature is linked to the dielectric constant of the material and reveals its response to external electric and optical fields. Several prominent peaks are also observed in the ultraviolet (UV) region, for types of 2D SiC structure as shown inFig. 15and16, suggesting that major plasmon excitations and energy losses occur in this range.

In the visible spectrum, the ELF displays moderate peaks, which correspond to interband electronic transitions. These transitions provide insight into the band structure and optical gap of 2D SiC. In the infrared region, the ELF decreases, showing that the material becomes more transparent and exhibits less energy loss in the infrared region.

Additionally, the presence of smaller energy peaks in the ELF may be attributed to phonon interactions and lower-energy excitations, hinting at underlying electron-phonon coupling mechanisms. Understanding these features is essential for exploring the electrical and optical characteristics of 2D-SiC, which has promising potential for applications in optoelectronics, high-power devices, and nanoelectronic systems.

Now, we analyzed the various characteristics of our proposed LED device. Throughout this analysis, 2D SiC was utilized as an active layer under different conditions, including pure, defect, and doped states. We have already analyzed the electrical and optical characteristics of pure SiC, defected SiC, and doped SiC.Table 1provides a comprehensive overview of the electrical properties, optical characteristics, and device performance for various active layers. In this context, blue light (λb) is designated as 450 nm, green light (λg) as 550 nm, and red light (λr) as 650 nm.124Since LED technology is optimized for materials with a direct band gap, we focused on those materials exclusively. Afterward, we changed the active layer of our proposed LED by using defected SiC, and doped SiC. In order to create a white LED, it is necessary to obtain structures that are capable of emitting blue, green, and red light. Subsequently, we determined the specific active layer that is accountable for producing visible light in our proposed LED. We found these structures through analysis of the power spectral density curve. Following the examination of the power spectral density curve, we proceed to analyze the remaining attributes of our proposed LED, focusing solely on the structures accountable for emitting blue, green, and red light.

At constant 5 V, power spectral density in TCAD was measured with respect to wavelength. The simulated emission spectra are not symmetrical; they have a wider low-energy tail and a sharper high-energy cutoff. This phenomenon is caused by using Lorentzian broadening in the optical model, as well as the energy-dependent joint density of states and the Fermi–Dirac carrier distribution. The likelihood of radiative recombination changes over the energy spectrum, which causes the spectral profile to be asymmetric. The observed asymmetry is in line with electroluminescence spectra seen in several light-emitting devices that use semiconductors.

Initially, the model created by pure SiC was employed as an active layer in our proposed device, and the corresponding power spectral density curve is depicted inFig. 17(a).Fig. 17(a)indicates that the peak intensity occurs at a wavelength of 480 nm. Subsequently, a single antisite defect in SiC (CSi) was employed as the active layer, with the peak power spectral density observed at 620 nm. Thereafter, a double antisite defect in SiC (Si ↔ C) was utilized as the active layer, exhibiting a maximum power spectral density intensity at 868 nm. Using InSias the active layer gave the highest power spectral density at 504 nm, which is close to green light. However, by utilizing CaSias the active layer, we achieved the highest power spectral density at a wavelength of 534 nm, resulting in the emission of green light. We obtained the maximum power spectrum density at 628 nm and 613 nm, which emit near red light, when we employed AsSiand PSias the active layer, respectively. However, the maximum power spectral density, which is red light, was observed at 668 nm when KSiwas utilized as the active layer. Based on our power spectral density analysis as shown inFig. 17(b), by using the pristine SiC, CaSi, and KSias an active layer of our proposed LED should be capable of producing blue, green, and red light, respectively.

The simulated band structure of the proposed LED, incorporating pristine SiC, KSi, and CaSias an active layer, has been analyzed under an applied input voltage of 5 V. The corresponding results are illustrated inFig. 18(a). On the other hand, the radiative recombination rates for the proposed LED utilizing pristine SiC, KSi, and CaSiare presented inFig. 18(b).

Fig. 19(a)illustrates the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the proposed LED. The IQE characteristics depicted inFig. 19(a)indicate that the pristine SiC-based LED exhibits the highest internal quantum efficiency among the three configurations. In contrast, the CaSibased LED shows a little reduced IQE, whereas the KSibased LED shows the lowest IQE.

Each electron injected into the active region of an ideal LED results in the emission of a single photon. An electron, being a charged particle, produces a photon which is a particle of light. Photons generated within the active region must be able to escape the LED die. An ideal LED would achieve zero-loss extraction efficiency by emitting all of the photons generated in the active zone into space. However, in a practical LED, not all the power generated in the active region is emitted into the surrounding environment. The high refractive index of semiconductors contributes significantly to this reduced extraction efficiency.

The effectiveness of light extraction is characterized as:Here,Pintis the amount of light that the active area emits, and the optical power that is released into space is denoted asPout. The simulation assumes that the structure is level and smooth and that the emission is directed straight out from the surface. The study didn't take into account things like waveguiding, substrate absorption, and surface roughness, which made the estimation of LEE too perfect. We got the optical constants for 4H-SiC, namely the refractive index (n) and the absorption coefficient (α), from well-known experimental data.46,109,125We used first-principles calculations in this study to find the optical constants for 2D-SiC.

Absorption and the imaginary component of the dielectric function (ε2) also have a major impact on the LED structure's light extraction efficiency (LEE). An increase in the absorption coefficient inside the active region causes a decrease in LEE due to an increase in photon losses. In addition, absorption is directly affected by the imaginary component of the dielectric function (ε2), with a greaterε2value indicating more absorption losses and reduced LEE. Therefore, in order to increase LEE in SiC-based LEDs, it is vital to optimize the characteristics of the material in order to improved refractive index matching and obtain low absorption. The point doping approach significantly modifies the optical characteristics of materials, leading to decreased optical losses and a notable improvement in LEE relative to their pristine forms. After analyzing the optical properties of pristine SiC, KSi, and CaSi, we can see that KSigives the best optical characteristics. This improvement indicates that KSiis the most suitable candidate for optimizing LEE in the proposed LED configuration.

We determined the light extraction efficiency of our proposed structure as shown inFig. 19(b). A fixed bias of 5 V is used in these computations for the simulated LED structure. Notably, the efficiency is only 10.27% when utilizing pristine SiC as the active layer. However, employing CaSias an active layer results in a significant enhancement of our extraction efficiency, with an increase of 16.04%. When KSiis used as the active layer, the extraction efficiency is doubled to a value of 22.57% compared to when pristine SiC is employed as the active layer.

The computed LEE values provide us an idea of how well different 2D-SiC layouts can radiate. In practice, these values can be increased even more by optimizing photonic structures. Dielectric mirror back reflectors, microlens arrays, graded-index encapsulation, and surface patterning are some of the ways to improve light outcoupling by reducing total internal reflection. Adding optical enhancements to future simulations and device fabrication will help us get a better idea of how much light can be extracted from real LED systems.

In our proposed LED configuration, we utilized pure 2D-SiC, CaSi, and KSias an active layer to examine their effects on the relationship between anode voltage and anode current density. The relevant outcomes are depicted inFig. 20(a).Fig. 20(a)demonstrates that when utilizing pristine SiC, CaSi, and KSias the active layer, all exhibit nearly identical characteristics in terms of anode voltageversusanode current density. The current exhibits a higher value when pristine SiC is utilized as the active layer. Conversely, when we employ CaSias the active layer, it exhibits a relatively lower current.

A little difference in current density is apparent based on the individual material utilized. When pristine 2D-SiC acts as the active layer, the device has the maximum current density over the examined voltage range. Conversely, substituting the active layer with CaSiyields a somewhat diminished current density, indicating a disparity in charge carrier transport qualities or interfacial features between the electrode and the active material. An intermediate level of current conduction is indicated by the behavior of KSi, which is found to fall between these two scenarios.

An analysis has been conducted on the relationship between power output and anode current density in our suggested LED, while maintaining a fixed bias voltage of 5v. The active layer materials used in this analysis were pristine SiC, CaSi, and KSi. To examine the luminous electric power of the LED, it is necessary to have information on the current density (Js). The relationship between current density and the luminous power output is presented inFig. 20(b).Fig. 20(b)shows that when pristine SiC is employed as the active layer in our suggested LED, the increase in luminous power is slightly higher compared to using KSior CaSi. However, compared to pristine SiC, CaSiused as the active layer in our proposed LED, the luminous power increases slightly less when KSiis used.

The suggested LED structure utilizes pristine 2D-SiC as an active layer, resulting in light emission within the wavelength range of 440 nm to 485 nm. The emitted light exhibits a narrow line width and falls within the precise blue color region, as depicted inFig. 20(c). On the other hand, the proposed LED design has a CaSilayer as the active material, which enables the emission of light in the wavelength range of 478 nm to 539 nm. The light that is produced has a very small range of wavelengths and is located specifically in the green portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, as seen inFig. 20(c). By employing KSias an active layer, the proposed LED structure is able to emit light with a wavelength range of 580 nm to 674 nm.Fig. 20(c)shows that the emitted light has a short line width and is exactly in the red color area.

The single and multichip types are the two primary categories that represent the fabrication technology of white LED at present.62We proposed a single-chip design in which the three monochromatic light radiations produced by the green, blue, and red LEDs are combined to produce white light, as seen in (Fig. 21). An inherent benefit is in the ability to modify the necessary light color to suit various requirements. In all the LEDs, we employed 2D SiC as the active layer. Specifically, we utilized pure 2D SiC for the blue LED, CaSifor the green LED, and KSifor the red LED. The area size of each LED is determined by a thorough analysis of the power spectral density graph. Here, we alter the width to vary the area of the LED, but the length remains the same. The width of the red, green, and blue LED is represented by theWR,WGandWBsymbols, respectively. Our suggested LED chip has a width of 1 μm, with red, blue, and green LEDs having widths of 0.4, 0.34, and 0.26 μm, respectively (Fig. 21).

Yooet al.132looked at a number of electrical doping methods for 2D semiconductors, including substitutional, chemical, and charge-transfer methods. These methods have worked well in materials like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).133Wanget al.134came up with a modulation doping method that lets defects in nearby encapsulation layers provide or take free carriers. This makes it possible to do n- or p-type doping in 2D heterostructures without damaging them. Xuet al.135showed that high-energy ion implantation with a protective PMMA layer could dope 2D materials such as MoS2with phosphorus. This worked well for doping while causing less harm to the lattice structure.

Defect engineering is very important for controlling the flow of light and carriers. Chenet al.136found that adding group IIIA elements to 2D material such as WS2monolayers increases the quantum yield of photoluminescence and makes it easier to change the polarity of carriers. This helps make optoelectronic devices that work well and stay stable. Jianget al.90say that methods like electron beam irradiation, plasma treatment, and chemical doping make it easier to fine-tune defect patterns in 2D materials, which makes them work better.137Wanget al.138showed how to make ordered silicon vacancy arrays in SiC systems using a scalable, maskless focused ion beam approach. These arrays are photostable single-photon emitters that work better at lower doses. Telkhozhayeva and Girshevitz139looked at how the parameters of an ion beam and how it interacts with a substrate affect the production of defects in 2D materials. They came up with rules for making defects in a controlled and repeatable way.140Mohseniet al.40came up with a way to make SiC by employing aluminum precursors to make silicon vacancy and divacancy quantum defects directly. They changed the settings to increase the number of paramagnetic defects, which was confirmed by electron spin resonance studies.141Jinet al.142used cathodoluminescence to study silicon vacancies in 4H-SiC. This confirmed that these point defects are optically active.138,143At the same time, Beke and Gali144showed how to turn bulk SiC containing vacancies into nanoparticles, which is a process that can be used for quantum applications.

The simulations assume perfect ohmic connections and don't take into account excitonic effects, temperature fluctuations, or interface trap states. Also, the defect modeling based on supercells uses defect densities that are higher than what is usually seen in experiments. Advanced simulations and experimental testing will look at these things in the future. The results of the computer simulations are very useful for guiding actual work on optoelectronic devices made of 2D-SiC with dopants and defects.

The proposed white LED has three individual LED placed on top of each other. Each one is responsible for giving off red, green, or blue light. The intrinsic portion of each LED has a single layer of 2D-SiC that is point doped to emit certain wavelengths: K-doped 2D-SiC for red, Ca-doped 2D-SiC for green, and pure 2D-SiC for blue. The P-type and N-type zones are made up of strongly doped 4H-SiC, which has carrier concentrations of about 1 × 1018cm−3. Ion implantation orin situdoping during epitaxial growth are the most common ways to reach doping levels.109,148–151Photolithography and dry etching are used to make dielectric trenches, like SiO2, that separate the three emission zones. This is a common approach used in high-resolution LED arrays.152–154Selective area growth or transfer printing is used to make 2D-SiC monolayers, which lets the doped layers be arranged in space accurately.155–161Each LED unit has a top transparent electrode, like indium tin oxide (ITO) or graphene, and a bottom electrode that all pixels share. Graphene films or Ag nanowires are examples of current-spreading layers that can be used to make light emission more even and reduce resistive losses.160,162,163This setup makes it possible to put all three main emission colors on a single chip, which makes a small and adjustable white LED possible. The design uses fabrication methods that have already been used in the fields of 2D materials, micro-LEDs, and heterogeneous optoelectronics.

The recent experimental demonstration of monolayer 2D-SiC growth and advancements in 2D-3D heterostructure device fabrication show that the material systems and device concepts proposed in this study can be tested in the lab.51,54,55,57,141The fact that our theoretical results match up with recent events shows how important the proposed RGB white LED design is. It also shows how important it is for future study to keep using combined simulation-experiment methods. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the electrical and optical properties of two-dimensional silicon carbide (2D-SiC) under various structural configurations, including the pristine form, systems with antisite and vacancy defects, and doped with different foreign elements. Initially, we aim to identify which of the modified 2D-SiC retain a direct band gap upon the introduction of such defects or dopants. Our results show that pristine 2D-SiC possesses a direct band gap of 2.57 eV. Moreover, single atom doping in SiC, such as calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) preserves this direct band gap nature, indicating that controlled doping strategies can be employed to modulate the material's electronic properties, thus making it a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications, particularly in LEDs. To further explore the device-level performance, we utilized the SILVACO TCAD platform to conduct the simulations of LED structures incorporating 2D-SiC in pristine, defective, and doped forms. The simulation results confirm that the designed LEDs are capable of emitting light across the visible spectrum, specifically in the blue, green, and red regions, thereby enabling the generation of white light. Among the configurations studied, the LED based on pristine SiC exhibits the highest luminous intensity and maximum power spectral density. In contrast, the KSiLED demonstrates the highest light extraction efficiency (LEE), underscoring its potential for improved optical output in practical applications.
