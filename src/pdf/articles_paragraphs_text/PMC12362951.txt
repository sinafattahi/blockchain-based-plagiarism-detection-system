Circulating platelets are increasingly recognized for their critical involvement in thromboinflammatory complications during respiratory infections, underscoring the importance of comprehending their dual role in immunomodulation and hemostasis. The multifaceted roles of platelets are attributed to their inherent heterogeneity, where the molecular diversity enables their functional versatility. However, research remains deficient in dissecting platelet heterogeneity within respiratory infection contexts, capturing the platelet subpopulations exhibiting specialized functional roles, and elucidating the therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab.

Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions.

This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19.

A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.

The pathogenesis of severe respiratory illness is frequently associated with hyper-inflammatory responses characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and myeloid cell overactivation [1]. Under such hyper-inflammatory process, the increased incidence of thromboembolic complications is associated with increased mortality of severe respiratory infections [2]. Thromboembolic complications accompanied by hyper-inflammation underscore the intricate relationship between coagulation abnormalities and systemic inflammation. Previous research demonstrated that excessive immune activation triggers a pro-coagulant cascade [3], and conversely, thromboembolic events trap immune cells at the site of inflammation, promoting sustained immune cell activation that exacerbates the inflammatory response [4]. These interconnected mechanisms persist beyond acute infection, with emerging evidence linking sustained thromboinflammation to long-COVID symptoms such as chronic fatigue [5]. Notably, current clinical practice demonstrated that antiplatelet therapy could mitigate the thromboinflammatory processes and improve severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas anti-coagulation treatment, such as heparin administration, is inadequate to control disease progression [6]. This disparity underscores the necessity to comprehend platelets’ multifaceted roles in the inflammatory, thrombotic, and immunoregulatory processes, which will be beneficial to develop potential therapeutic strategies for disrupting the thromboinflammatory loop.

Platelets play a dual role in both hemostasis and the immune response in respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 and influenza, where activated platelets modulate the pro-inflammatory processes by releasing soluble mediators and directly interacting with immune cells, as demonstrated across studies [7,8]. Upon activation, they release α-granule C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CXCL4) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) to recruit monocytes/macrophages, amplifying IL-1β and IL-6 production [9], while driving neutrophil recruitment via P-selectin binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and glycoprotein Ib/glycoprotein IIbIIIa (GPIb/GPIIbIIIa)-mediated binding with β2-integrin macrophage antigen-1 (Mac-1, also known as CD11b/CD18) [10,11]. Platelet-derived high mobility group box 1-Toll-like receptor 4 (HMGB1-TLR4) signaling and C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) signaling further induce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), fueling thromboinflammation [7,12,13]. Beyond innate immunity, platelets bridge adaptive responses by presenting viral antigens via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) to CD8+T cells and modulating dendritic cell (DC) maturation through CD40 ligand (CD40L)-CD40 interactions, while CD40L binding with B-cell activating factor (BAFF) shapes B cell antibody responses [14,15]. These multifaceted interactions depend on platelet activation states, and their dysregulation exacerbates immunopathology, such as microvascular clotting and cytokine storms [5,16].

The diverse roles of platelets in both coagulation and inflammation are attributed to their heterogeneity. Previous studies have shed light on the platelet’s heterogeneity through the diverse components of the α-granules with varying patterns of release during platelet activation [17]. However, systematic investigations of platelet heterogeneity, particularly through omics approaches that resolve functionally distinct subpopulations, remain underexplored. While bulk transcriptomic studies have identified some broad immune and pro-thrombotic platelet signatures during respiratory infections, these analyses fail to capture the intra-platelet subpopulations exhibiting these specialized roles [18]. Current single-cell studies have achieved greater resolution and uncovered more immune-related platelet signatures in respiratory infections. However, these single-cell studies primarily focused on platelet-immune cell interactions, which often regarded platelets as a collective entity, lacking resolution into platelet subpopulations during respiratory infections [19–21]. Few single-cell research has systematically explored the intra-platelet diversity at the platelet subpopulation level. There is only one prior single-cell transcriptomic study by Qiu et al., that identified platelet subpopulations within the transcriptomic landscape integrated from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sepsis and COVID-19 [22]. However, their multi-disease framework prioritized the shared mechanisms across the autoimmune disease and acute systemic infections, which obscured the specificity for respiratory infection-associated heterogeneity driven by pulmonary vascular pathology and viral-induced responses. Taken together, there is a need to systematically explore the intra-platelet diversity within respiratory infection contexts. Precisely capturing the platelet subpopulations and systematically delineating their distinct functions in respiratory infections will deepen our understanding of the immune-thrombotic dysregulation during severe respiratory infections and provide a foundation for potential diagnostic biomarkers.

To achieve fine analytical depth to platelet heterogeneity investigation, we collected single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from published sources involving 190 individuals, and established three study cohorts central to respiratory disease mechanisms: (1) COVID-19 severity stratification, (2) COVID-19 therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 severe respiratory infections. The first cohort delineates distinct platelet subpopulations associated with the severity of respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Clinical practice indexed the efficacy of corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by severe COVID-19 or other severe respiratory illnesses [23,24]. In the therapeutic responsiveness cohort of an additional 32 severe COVID-19 patients, we investigated how dexamethasone and tocilizumab modulate platelet-immune cell interactions and explored potential platelet-associated targets, a dimension largely unexplored in prior single-cell studies. Subsequently, we extended our illustration to non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses to preliminarily compare the platelet heterogeneity between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses. As a whole, our integrative annotation framework, combining pseudotime trajectory analysis, high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), and cell-cell communication analysis, enhances functional annotation of platelet heterogeneity beyond prior studies [22], offering a multifaceted perspective on subpopulation characteristics linked to respiratory illness severity. These findings advance our understanding of platelet heterogeneity and its participation in respiratory illness pathogenesis.

The 10× Genomics Cell Ranger software (version 5.0.1) was utilized to process single-cell gene expression data retrieved from E-MTAB-10026,GSE149689,GSE157789, andGSE155224. The command cellranger mkfastq was employed to generate FASTQ files from the raw sequencing data. Subsequently, a count matrix was created for each sample by mapping the FASTQ files to the human genome reference GrCh38. This count matrix contained gene expression levels corresponding to the barcodes of each cell in the sample.

Scrublet (v0.2.1) was applied to each sample to generate doublet scores, which exhibited a bimodal distribution. The tool’s automatic threshold was then utilized. Non-empty droplets were identified within each multiplexed pool of donors using the emptyDrops function from the Bioconductor package DropletUtils (v1.10.3), with a UMI threshold of 100 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. The probability of each cell being a doublet was estimated per sample (i.e., one 10x lane) using the doubletCells function in the scran package, based on highly variable genes (HVGs). Next, we employed the cluster_walktrap algorithm on the shared nearest neighbor graph computed from HVGs to create highly resolved clusters for each sample. Clusters were tagged as doublets if they had a median doublet score greater than the median plus 2.5 times the median absolute deviation (MAD), or if they contained more than the median plus 2.5 times MAD genotype doublets. This was followed by a second round of highly resolved clustering across the entire dataset, where cells in clusters with a high proportion (> 60%) of previously labeled doublets were also classified as doublets.

The combined raw data was filtered to exclude cells that expressed fewer than 200 genes and had more than 10% mitochondrial reads. Highly variable genes (HVGs) were identified using the Seurat variance-stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm. Harmony was employed to adjust the principal components (PCs) by sample ID, which facilitated the generation of the neighborhood graph and its embedding using UMAP. Clustering was conducted using the Leiden algorithm with an initial resolution of 1.5 based on 30 principal components. Subsequently, platelet functional subpopulations were annotated by comparing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and merging clusters with functionally similar gene expression profiles, which were further validated through quantitative analyses and supervised classifications to justify their delineation (see Supplementary Methods).

Platelet clusters exhibiting high expression levels of canonical markers, including proplatelet basic protein (PPBP), platelet factor 4 (PF4), glycoprotein IX platelet (GP9), integrin subunit alpha 2b (ITGA2B), integrin subunit beta 3 (ITGB3), and glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit alpha (GP1BA), were selected for further analysis. For sub-clustering the platelet population, principal component analysis (PCA) and t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) were performed to reduce dimensionality and enhance visualization. Nearest neighbors were computed based on 20 principal components, and cells were grouped using the FindClusters function with a resolution of 0.7, resulting in the identification of 18 distinct populations. Marker genes for each population were detected using the DEsingle package, adhering to a false discovery rate–adjusted P-value of < 0.01.

Platelets were extracted, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the DEsingle package. DEGs were considered significant if they had an absolute log2 fold change greater than 0.3, a false discovery rate–adjusted P-value of less than 0.05, and expression in at least 10% of platelets in the comparison group. Using the focused DEGs, functional analyses were conducted, including gene over-representation analysis for gene ontology biological processes and functional enrichment analysis. These analyses were visualized using the Metascape gene enrichment analysis tool (https://metascape.org), Cytoscape (version 3.9.1) and clusterProfiler (version 4.6.0). Terms with a P-value of less than 0.01 and a minimum gene count of 3 were selected for display.

To assess the activity of platelet-associated functions based on the condition, we retrieved gene sets from the GSEA database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/genesets.jsp?collection=CP). We calculated the activity of each term using the AddModuleScore function from the Seurat package, which computes a score for each cell by comparing it to 100 randomly selected control genes.

hdWGCNA (v.0.3.0) was conducted with the log normalized count matrix and created a signed-hybrid network with a soft threshold of 7 using bi-weight mid-correlation. The minimum module size was set to 100 to ensure robust module identification. Subsequently, modules exhibiting an eigengene correlation of less than 0.2 were merged to enhance the interpretability of the network, resulting in a final configuration of six distinct modules. This approach allowed for the comprehensive exploration of gene co-expression patterns and the identification of biologically relevant modules within the dataset.

The CellChat package version 1.6.1 was utilized to reconstruct differential cell-cell interaction networks [25]. By employing the compareInteractions function in CellChat, the total numbers of interactions and their strengths were computed. Subsequently, over-expressed ligands or receptors identified within cell populations were mapped onto the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. CellChat enhances the understanding of biologically significant cell-cell communication by assigning probability values to each interaction and conducting permutation tests. CellChat determines significant signaling pathways and ligand-receptor pairs using thep< 0.05 threshold, derived from permutation tests, to restrict false positives for low-abundance ligands and receptors [25]. Visualization of the communication network and signaling pathways was achieved through circle plots, heatmaps, and bubble graphs. To filter receptor-ligand edges and generate Circos plots, the differential edge list underwent processing via netVisual_chord_gene in CellChat.

The R package monocle2 (v2. 24. 0) was used to identify trajectories of single cells to detect cell state transitions. The Seurat object preprocessed by the previous step is used as input for monocle2, where the package employs reversed graph embedding and differential expression analysis algorithms to construct trajectories representing the developmental paths of individual cells. These trajectories provide insights into the progression of cell states and transitions between different cellular states over time or under specific condition. Key genes and regulatory pathways driving cell fate decisions and transitions were identified by analyzing the gene expression dynamics along these trajectories.

Differences with a P value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant (symbol * for < 0.05). Data are presented as mean ± SEM or SD, and an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA was selected.

To understand the fluctuation of circulating platelet heterogeneity during respiratory infections, we collected single-cell transcriptome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of 158 individuals with varied COVID-19 severities [26] (asymptomatic COVID-19n= 13; mild COVID-19n= 62; severe COVID-19n= 38) and non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness (n= 5), together with healthy volunteers as controls (n= 28) and intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administrated healthy volunteers as a surrogate control (n= 12) to an acute systemic inflammatory response (retrieved from E-MTAB-10026 [27],GSE149689[28]) (Fig.1A). A total of 695,699 cells were screened after filtering the data with stringent high quality, yielding a mean of 8946 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell and detecting 26,728 genes per cell on average (Fig.1B). The transcriptome profiles of the biological replicates we gathered were highly reproducible, ensuring the high quality of the scRNA-seq data analyzed in this study. In addition, COVID-19 patients who received hormonal and immunological treatments are included in later analyses of this study to investigate the platelet alteration corresponding to dexamethasone and tocilizumab administrations (GSE157789[29],GSE155224[30]).

After subjecting the 695,699 cells to uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) based on highly variable genes using the Seurat package, we identified 10 distinct immune cell populations and further identified 26 additional cell states through Leiden clustering unbiased by patients or experimental batches (Fig.1B, Fig. S1A). The cells were manually annotated based on the RNA expression of the canonical marker genes (Fig.1C, Fig. S1B). Alongside the comprehensive alterations in the immunological profile, we observed an expansion of the platelet population with worsening COVID-19 condition which is consistent with the trend in clinical blood cell count data (Fig.1B, Fig. S1C). Meanwhile, non-COVID-19 and IV-LPS groups also exhibit platelet enrichment compared to healthy control (Fig.1B). Two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on each cell type demonstrated that platelets exhibit quantitative changes in severe COVID-19 compared to both healthy control and the mild condition, unlike the limited changes between mild COVID-19 and the healthy group. Consistent with previous studies, in severe COVID-19, we observed the proportion of CD14+monocytes increased, whereas nonclassical CD16+monocytes, T cell group, and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in this study cohort (Fig.1D). Previous studies demonstrated the correlation between the fluctuation of those immune cells and disease outcomes [31,32]. Principal component analysis (PCA) of all cells, annotated by cell types, revealed that the variance in the platelet population was captured by the second principal component, distinct from the variance explained by the first principal component, which primarily accounted for immune cell types (Fig. S1E). This orthogonal separation suggests platelets’ transcriptional divergence from immune cells and specialized functions. Taken together, the quantitative changes in platelet population prompt us to investigate platelets’ diverse role in respiratory infections.

Besides the quantitative alteration, platelet population sub-clustering analysis showed the potential qualitative variance inside the platelet population related to the disease conditions. After extracting the platelet population and projecting it to UMAP, we preliminarily identified 8 platelet sub-clusters. Severe COVID-19 condition enriched platelets in cluster 2 compared to those in mild and non-COVID-19 condition (Fig.1E). In addition, differential gene expression analysis reveals distinct gene expression patterns under different disease groups (Fig. S1D).

To further uncover the severity-associated transcriptional signatures in the platelet population, we performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) to project platelets from COVID-19 samples across asymptomatic (A,n= 13), mild (M,n= 62) and severe (S,n= 38) severities and healthy donors (H,n= 28). The fine-resolution clustering of mRNA profiles and reveals 18 initial clusters. Broader platelet subpopulations were annotated based on the 18 clusters by comparing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the signature genes of platelet biology in the literature and combining clusters that express functionally similar genes (Fig.2A-B, S2A-B). As a result, six functional subpopulations were identified: (1) immunothrombotic (Imm-T) platelets, abbreviated as Imm-T PLT, with dual roles in coagulation via intensive platelet activation/aggregation and pro-inflammatory immune signaling, (2, 3) two immunologically specialized subpopulations, named immune platelet-A and immune platelet-B, abbreviated as immune PLT-A, immune PLT-B in figures, (4) stress-sensitive PLT, abbreviated as stress PLT, (5) immature PLT, and (6) a small cluster of platelets designated PLTx (Fig.2A). A Sankey diagram was drawn to depict the flow of cells from initial to final cluster assignments (Fig.S2A). UMAP plots show the spatial distribution with cluster centroids computed (Fig.S2B). We employed a hybrid approach to quantitatively justify the delineation of the six subpopulations, including (1) the Jaccard similarity index and hypergeometric tests to assess the statistical significance of shared pathway enrichment; (2) supervised classification by random forest models to validate the transcriptional distinctiveness of the initial and final clusters; and (3) silhouette score analysis to evaluate the cohesion and separation of the initial 18 clusters and final 6 subpopulations. The out-of-bag (OOB) error rate calculated from random forest models was reduced from 39.83% for the initial clusters to 16.07% for the final clusters, indicating improved classification performance after merging (Fig.S2C). Feature importance scores were computed to identify the top discriminatory genes as PPBP, HIST1H2AC, and TSC22D1 (Fig.S2D). Given the close proximity of immune platelet-A and Imm-T platelet subpopulations on UMAP (Fig.S2E), we further used a confusion matrix to classify these two subpopulations. The low error rates (0.0583 and 0.1395) confirmed that these two subpopulations are reliably separable (Fig.S2E). The Jaccard similarity of the enriched pathways between the clusters reinforces the biological coherence within the six subpopulations (Fig.S2F). The silhouette score distributions for the final clusters are slightly higher than those for the initial clusters, as shown in Fig.S2F, indicating that the final clusters exhibit better or at least comparable quality compared to the initial 18 clusters. These analyses validated the delineation and transcriptional coherence of the six functional subpopulations.

To annotate and illustrate the functionality of the above six platelet subpopulations, we analyzed the pathways enriched through gene ontology (GO) analysis (Fig.2B), and applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to score the six platelet subpopulations with four gene sets representing their respective functions (Fig.2C). The immunothrombotic platelet subpopulation is characterized by two key functionalities: coagulation with intensive platelet activation and aggregation and pro-inflammatory immune response. Upregulated expression of gene markers including myosin light chain 9 (MYL9), parvin-β (PARVB) and actin-β (ACTB), implicates cytokinesis, receptor capping and cell mobility, and indicates the coagulation potential in the Imm-T platelet subpopulation (Fig.2B). Additionally, expression of Fc receptor IgG low-affinity I-γ chain (FCER1G), mediates interactions with IgE, thereby promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators during allergic reactions, particularly in conditions like asthma or anaphylaxis. On the other hand, calreticulin (CALR), a chaperone protein, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and its upregulation activates innate immune signaling to enhance antigen presentation and danger signals release [33]. We conducted the protein interaction network analysis of the top 100 up-regulated genes of the immunothrombotic platelet subpopulation based on STRING v12 and uncovered 12 protein interaction clusters [34]. In the Imm-T platelet subpopulation, protein interaction network analysis of the top 100 differentially expressed genes identifies clusters enriched for antigen presentation, chemotaxis and IgG binding processes (Fig.S3A). Together, the transcriptomic patterns of the Imm-T platelet subpopulation prompt its capacity to bridge hemostasis and immune defense.

The immune platelet-A subpopulation facilitates leukocyte trans-endothelial migration and exhibits innate immune responding ability with an IL-6 signaling pathway enriched (Fig.2B). A previous study reported that IL-6 is associated with the severity of COVID-19 and the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [35]. In addition to IL-6 signaling, this subpopulation expressed high-level interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) (Fig.2B). Another feature of the Immune platelet A subpopulation is characterized by the expression of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) which potentially mediates platelet response to hormonal signals (Table S1 [see Additional file 2]). Progesterone, a steroid hormone, has been studied for its potential role in modulating the hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathology [36]. Previous studies suggest progesterone has anti-inflammatory properties to alleviate lung inflammation, reduce lung injury, and suppress cytokine storm [36]. Another subpopulation the immune platelet-B tends to be more active in adaptive immune response with antigen processing and presenting capacity by upregulation of cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) and eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) (Fig.2B). The stress-sensitive platelets unfold the typical hyper-activated status of oxidative stress response with expression of genes encoding histone, such as HIST2H4A, HIST1H4H, and HIST1H2AE, together with cytokine production regulation and chemotaxis pathways enriched (Fig.2B). Immature platelet intensively upregulated genes that link to platelet cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis signaling (Fig.2B).

To inspect the relationship between disease conditions and the six platelet subpopulations, we noticed that the Imm-T platelet subpopulation with elevated immune responsiveness and coagulation potential was enriched and depleted in the severe and mild COVID-19 group, respectively (Fig.2D, S3B). Of note, the up-regulated genes in Imm-T platelets were associated with previously defined gene sets for “COVID-19_THROMBOSIS_AND_ANTICOAGULATION”, implying the significant role of this platelet subpopulation in severe COVID-19 condition (Fig.2C). GSEA analysis reveals TNF-α signaling is upregulated in the immune platelet-A subpopulation enriched in severe COVID-19 condition (Fig.S3C). A high level of TNF-α has been reported as an indicator of severe COVID-19 and is known to exacerbate inflammatory signatures such as myeloid cell overactivation [37].

We further conducted trajectory analysis with Monocle2 [38] to align the six platelet subpopulations along the disease severity. Pseudotime trajectories in platelets reflect functional state transitions, from quiescent to activated states or variations in priming for specific roles (e.g., aggregation or immune response), driven by differences in mRNA content inherited from megakaryocytes or post-transcriptional regulation [39,40]. In the trajectory we establish, the Imm-T platelet subpopulation and stress-sensitive platelet subpopulation correspond to later and earlier stages of pseudo-time, respectively (Fig.2E). Immature platelets are newly released thrombocytes that exhibit heightened metabolic activity and larger size, likely appearing around the earlier stage in the trajectory (Fig.2E) [41]. After ordering the cells along with the trajectory analysis, platelets from severe COVID-19 condition exhibit a distinct trajectory ending point that corresponds to the Imm-T platelet subpopulation, in contrast to those from mild COVID-19 condition, which demonstrate a trajectory ending point aligning with the immune platelet A and B subpopulations (Fig.2F). This divergence suggests potential distinction in functional transitions. In severe cases, platelets may be more actively participating in thrombus formation and vascular complications associated with the disease, together with potent immune reactivity.

To compact the transcriptomic patterns reflecting platelet heterogeneity under different COVID-19 severity conditions, we used the platelet profile to reconstruct the gene regulation networks (GRNs) by high dimensional weighted gene co-expression analysis (hdWGCNA) [42] and identified hub genes regulating the six platelet subpopulations across COVID-19 severity. Platelet populations from mild, severe and healthy donors, with a total of 559,741 platelets and 26,728 genes, were used for this computation. Six co-expressed gene modules (PLT-M1 through PLT-M6, each containing > 100 genes) were identified (Fig.3A). tSNE projections of the six gene modules provide a visual representation that highlights the potential alignment between gene modules and the six platelet subpopulations (Fig.3A). After screening the six modules against the expression profile of the six platelet subpopulations, PLT-M3 was upregulated in the Imm-T platelet subpopulation while the PLT-M1, M4, M5, and M6 were upregulated in the two immune platelet subpopulations and downregulated in Imm-T platelets (Fig.3B). We observed PLT-M1, M4, and M5 enriched in immune platelet-A, which implements innate immune response as described above in Fig.2B, and PLT-M6 enriched in immune platelet-B with adaptive immune capability (Fig.3B). The mapping between the gene modules and platelet subpopulations was confirmed by correlation analysis (Fig.3C). The alignment between the gene co-expression modules and the six platelet subpopulations offers valuable insights into the underlying molecular heterogeneity within the platelet population.

Correlation analyses between the six gene modules and disease conditions demonstrate that PLT-M3 exhibits a significant positive correlation, while PLT-M1, M4, M5, and M6 exhibit a significant negative correlation with the severity of COVID-19. (Fig.3D). Given these modules linked to COVID-19 severity, a significant negative internal correlation emerged between PLT-M1 and PLT-M3, signifying that PLT-M1 negatively correlated and PLT-M3 positively correlated with disease severity (Fig.3D). PLT-M3 is characterized by platelet hyperactivity and immune-activated status across innate and adaptive responses with marker genes as integrin-α2b (ITGA2B), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) indicating platelet activation; Fc fragment of IgE receptor 1 (FCER1), CFL1, HLA and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-like 1 (TREML1) suggesting immune activation; and ACTB, actin-γ1 (ACTG1), myosin light chain 6 (MYL6), MYL9, PARVB indicating enhanced immune cell migration (Fig.3E, F). Conversely, PLT-M1 has the potential to downregulate viral-induced cytoplasmic pattern recognition processes, suggesting a role in the modulation of immune responses in the context of COVID-19 severity. PLT-M1 showed the expression of marker genes: a regulator of G protein signaling 18 (RGS18) as a modulator of immune response by negatively regulating G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways in immune cells; E74-like factor 1 (ELF1) acting as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses; RAS guanyl releasing protein 2 (RASGRP2), that could influence immune cell activation and vascular integrity by mediating Ras/MAPK signaling pathways; and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2) controlling antioxidant gene expression to protect against oxidative stress contributing to immune and inflammatory processes (Fig.3E, F). The positive correlation of PLT-M3 with COVID-19 severity highlights its role in promoting the pro-inflammatory process and platelet activation that could exacerbate thrombosis and disease progression.

We also observed that PLT-M3 and PLT-M2, aligned with severe COVID-19 occurrence, were positively correlated with the male sex. The immunological imprints harbored in PLT-M3 potentially interpret that, indicated by previous research, males are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and have a higher mortality rate compared to females [43]. We further investigated the module correlation with aging and discovered that PLT-M2 and PLT-M4 show positive and negative correlations, respectively, with the older population (Fig.3D). Previous research indicated that increased vulnerability in older demographics is attributed to a decline in immune function with age, known as immune senescence, which results in a reduced ability to mount an effective immune response against the virus [44,45]. We observed the gene modules with platelet hyperactivity (PLT-M2) expanded and the gene modules with immune activation (PLT-M4, M5) diminished in older COVID-19 patients in platelet transcriptome (Fig.3D).

To further contextualize the associations between the gene modules and sex/age while controlling for disease severity, we categorized patients by disease severity (healthy, mild, and severe COVID-19) and conducted separate analyses within each stratum to assess whether the observed associations persisted. The correlations were visualized in the heatmap (Fig.S3D). The results confirmed that PLT-M3’s positive correlation with male sex was significant in severe and mild COVID-19 groups (Fig.S3D). PLT-M3 and PLT-M2, associated with severe COVID-19, exhibited significant positive correlations with male sex, particularly in severe COVID-19 groups but not in healthy controls (Fig.S3D), aligns with prior research indicating that males are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms and higher mortality rate [43]. Regarding age, PLT-M2 showed a positive correlation with older age in healthy and mild COVID-19 groups, but this association reversed in severe COVID-19 (Fig.S3D). Conversely, PLT-M4 displayed a negative correlation with age in the mild COVID-19 group, yet a positive correlation in severe COVID-19 (Fig.S3D). Stratified analyses revealed differential age-related associations with platelet gene modules, highlighting the intricate impact of disease severity on age-related platelet gene expression. This underscores the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these transcriptomic shifts. These stratified correlation analyses delineated the interplay of sex, age, and disease severity in shaping platelet transcriptomic profiles.

We further inspected the interactions of the six platelet subpopulations with the main immune cell types, aiming to elucidate the functionality at the level of cell-cell communication using CellChat [25]. The differential interaction number and strength between severe and mild COVID-19 condition indicated a wide range of variations in global communication patterns (Fig. S4A,4A).

The pathway-level dynamics of cell-cell communication (CCC) patterns were analyzed by differential expression (DE) analysis of the platelets involved in CCC pathways. During severe COVID-19, the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type C (CD45) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) pathways sourcing from platelet subpopulations were upregulated, while the amyloid precursor protein (APP), cluster of differentiation-99 (CD99), C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL), major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and C-type lectin-like domain-containing receptor (CLEC) pathways sourcing from platelets were downregulated (Fig.4B). CD45 and CXCL pathways are critical for immune cell activation and recruitment. The CD99 pathway plays a pivotal role in the process of cell adhesion and migration, particularly in facilitating the migration of monocytes [46]. The angiogenesis role of the CCL pathway facilitates cell migration and wound healing [47], which are more pronounced in mild COVID-19. Notably, the MHC-I and CLEC pathways potentially indicated an enhanced antigen presentation capacity in platelets under mild COVID-19. CLEC-2, expressed on platelets, has been shown to bind to podoplanin on cancer cells, facilitating the immune system’s recognition [48,49].

For the incoming signaling of platelet population, selectin L glycoprotein ligand (SELPLG), resistin-like molecule alpha (RESISTIN), cluster of differentiation 22 (CD22) and thrombospondin (THBS) pathways were upregulated while junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), CD99 and APP pathways downregulated in severe COVID-19 (Fig.4B). From the pathways enriched in severe COVID-19, SELPLG, RESISTIN together with the THBS pathway suggest the hyper-activated and pro-inflammatory characteristics of the platelet population enriched in severe COVID-19 condition. SELPLG is implicated in platelet aggregation and activation, together with a role in immune cell recruitment to the sites of inflammation, influencing the overall inflammatory response and tissue remodeling [50]. The RESISTIN pathway is reported to promote a significant role in the inflammatory process by promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, enhancing immune cell recruitment [51]. From the pathways enriched in the mild condition in the platelet population, the JAM and PDGF pathways are associated with tissue-repairing function, as supported by studies on their roles in hemostatic responses and tissue repair [52,53].

To further inspect the CCC patterns at the cellular level and understand the dynamics of receptor-ligand interactions, we reviewed specific interaction profiles between platelets and neutrophils, NK cells, monocytes, and T cells. In severe COVID-19, the six platelet subpopulations, especially the Imm-T platelets, upregulate crosstalk towards neutrophils through platelet-secreted PPBP molecules and the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) expressed on neutrophils (Fig.4C). Ligand binding to CXCR2 enhances neutrophil activation and recruitment to the lung, which is linked to increased inflammation and contributes to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [54]. While the overall interaction strength between NK cells and platelets tends to be decreased in severe condition (Fig.4D), a receptor-ligand pair CLEC-2-KLRB1 enriched in severe condition (Fig.4E), specifically from the immature platelets and stress-sensitive platelets which locate at an earlier stage in trajectory timeline (Fig.2D). CLECs are pattern recognition receptors that modulate platelet and immune cell activation [55,56]. KLRB1, also known as CD161, functions as an inhibitory receptor on NK and T cells, potentially inhibiting cell activation [57].

Turning the attention to monocyte signaling, in contrast to NK cell signaling, the interaction increased between platelets and monocytes in severe COVID-19 condition (Fig.4F). Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) molecules binding to CD47 are the functional ligand-receptor pairs inside this interaction (Fig.4G, S4B). Monocytes in severe COVID-19 condition turn out to be the instructor-secreting THBS1 molecules (Fig.4G). THBS1 activates platelets through the CD47 receptor, leading to enhanced adhesion and aggregation, which are essential for the formation of a stable clot at the site of vascular injury [58]. THBS1-CD47 signaling was exalted in severe condition indicating dominated pro-thrombotic reactions (Fig.4G). Another noteworthy ligand-receptor pair is the MHC-I molecules on platelets interacting with the receptors on T and NK cells (Fig.5A). In contrast to healthy and mild conditions, a notable shift was observed in severe COVID-19, where the target cells of the MHC-I pathway transitioned from NK cells to T cells (Fig.5A). The interaction strength between T cells and the six platelet subpopulations increased in general compared between healthy and COVID-19 conditions (Fig. S4C).

To amplify our CCC investigation in severe COVID-19 condition, we examined a new study cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, with stratification of stable (n= 12) and progressive (n= 6) clinical status, as part of the Yale COVID-19 IMPACT (Implementing Medical and Public Health Action Against Coronavirus CT) biorepository [30]. Progressive clinical status required ICU treatment with a succumbed outcome, while stable status was defined for severe patients who were hospitalized in internal medicine wards and successfully recovered, leading to discharge outcomes. Regarding the DE pathways sourcing from platelets, stable clinical condition enriched CLEC and CXCL pathways. In contrast, the progressive condition is characterized by enhanced CCL signaling (Fig.5B). In addition, the MHC-I pathway targeting platelets is specifically enriched in progressive condition (Fig.5B). In patients with progressive status, immune platelet-B subpopulation exhibited more active cell-to-cell communications, acting as source cells, while the level of communication from immature platelets was notably reduced (Fig.5C, Fig. S4D). In immune platelet-B subpopulation, the levels of MHC-I and CD99 signaling were elevated in the progressive state (Fig.5D). In contrast, the CD99 and MHC-I pathways in the immature platelet subpopulation were downregulated in progressive status, along with reduced THBS, CLEC, CXCL, ICAM, ITGB2, and PARS pathways (Fig. S4E). These results highlight the specialized functions carried out by immune platelet-B and immature platelet subpopulations during stable and progressive status. The ligand-receptor pairs in the MHC-I pathway compared between stable and progressive COVID-19 status are shown in Fig.5E.

Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, is commonly used in the treatment of severe COVID-19 to mitigate the hyperinflammatory response [23]. To elucidate the potential impact of tocilizumab treatment on the six platelet subpopulations, we launched a new study cohort that included hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab treatment (n= 14) and without tocilizumab treatment (n= 4). Following filtration and cleanup, 2,036 platelets were included in the following cell-cell communication analysis (Fig. S5A-B). Following tocilizumab administration, the overall number and strength of interactions receded as shown in Fig. S5C.

After treatment, there was a reduction in the interaction between platelets as instructors and IFN-activated CD8+T cells (IFI1+/IFI3+) (Fig.6A). The ligand-receptor pair mediates this communication involving MHC-I molecules expressed on platelets binding to CD8 receptors on IFN-activated CD8+T cells (Fig.6C). In contrast, communication pathways targeting platelets from other immune cell types, including memory B cells, memory CD4+T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), and NK cells, were notably enhanced after tocilizumab treatment (Fig.6A). Of note, memory CD4 T cells talked to the immune platelet-B subpopulation only after tocilizumab treatment. This interaction was facilitated by the binding of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to its receptor CD74, along with the co-receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) (Fig.6D). MIF binding to CD74 can initiate intracellular signaling cascades that modulate the activation of various immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 [59]. On the other hand, the binding of MIF to CXCR4 contributes to chemotaxis, cell adhesion, and immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation [60]. The differential expressed pathways are described in Fig.6B and Fig. S5D. We observed that immature platelets exhibited upregulated engagement in Semaphorin-4 (SEMA4) and CD34 pathways while downregulating their participation in nectin cell adhesion molecule (NECTIN) and CD226 pathways, as shown in Fig. S5D. These alterations suggest the potential influence post tocilizumab treatment on the immature platelet function.

Dexamethasone treatment has been shown to reduce mortality by approximately one-third in severe COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support, as demonstrated in the RECOVERY trial [24]. To illustrate the role of platelets in relation to dexamethasone efficacy, we uncovered the platelet-involved cell interactions in a new study cohort comprising six severe COVID-19 patients who received dexamethasone treatment and eight severe COVID-19 patients who did not receive the medication. After filtering, a total of 86,371 high-quality cells were mapped onto UMAP and clustered into 15 cell types as shown in Fig. S6A. The platelet population was projected to obtain the six platelet subpopulations we identified from the above COVID-19 cohort (Fig. S6A). The total amount and strength of cell interactions were reduced after dexamethasone administration (Fig. S6B). There are 10 cell types that displayed altered incoming and outgoing interaction strength after dexamethasone administration (Fig.7A). The interactions sourcing from Imm-T platelets were repressed remarkably after dexamethasone administration, while the stress-sensitive platelet group relatively increased their interactions with other cells after dexamethasone treatment (Fig.7A) Of note, Imm-T platelets downregulated their talks with CD8+effector memory T cells (CD45RO+/KLRG1+/CD62Llow). Stress-sensitive platelets enhanced their interaction with NK cells, type I IFN-active neutrophils, and CD8+effector memory T cells typically. Meanwhile, the immune platelet-B group and immature platelet group also elevated their interaction with NK cells (Fig.7B).

Regarding the signaling level, the CCL pathway, sourcing from Imm-T platelets towards monocytes and IFN-active neutrophils, was repressed after dexamethasone treatment (Fig.7C, D). Lower levels of CCL could skew monocyte populations towards a more anti-inflammatory phenotype, which might be beneficial in avoiding excessive inflammation [61]. Another pathway targeting monocytes is the GP1BA signaling. The GP1BA pathway sourcing from stress-sensitive platelets was reduced following dexamethasone treatment (Fig.7D). In contrast, we noticed the Imm-T platelets and immature platelets upregulated GP1BA signaling strength after dexamethasone treatment (Fig.7D). GP1BA gene encodes a subunit of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, which is crucial for platelet activation and adhesion [62]. The decrease of GP1BA signaling among platelet subpopulations may suggest that the dexamethasone treatment potentially withholds the platelet activation process in the stress-sensitive platelet group and immune platelet-A group. In addition, the APP pathway sourcing from Imm-T platelets towards B cells was attenuated after dexamethasone treatment (Fig.7D). Further investigation is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this inhibition. In addition, we observed TGF-β signaling was enriched only in the non-treatment group (Fig.7E). The THBS pathway sourcing from Imm-T platelets was also suppressed after dexamethasone administration (Fig.7C, Fig. S6C). We noticed the Imm-T platelets reduced CD99 signaling compared to other platelet subpopulations after dexamethasone administration (Fig. S6D). Regarding the incoming signaling of Imm-T platelets, the CD99 signaling from NK cells, monocytes, and CD8+effector memory T cells was reduced after dexamethasone administration (Fig. S6D). The communication probability of these ligand-receptor pairs of Imm-T platelets signaling, compared with and without dexamethasone treatment groups, are shown in Fig. S7.

In the above results, we dissected platelet heterogeneity in the context of COVID-19 severity and comprehensively described how these subpopulations evolve in different COVID-19 severity conditions. Here we extended our understanding of these six platelet subpopulations to the non-COVID-19 condition, to compare the platelet heterogeneity between COVID-19 (abbr. Cov,n= 102) and non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness individuals (abbr. non-Cov,n= 5) (Fig.8A, Fig. S8A). We observed fluctuation in the six platelet subpopulations when compared between the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 conditions. Specifically, the immune platelet-A group was notably enriched in patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory diseases, while a marked increase in stress-sensitive platelets and immature platelets was observed in COVID-19 patients (Fig.8B).

To examine the platelet status between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 condition, we constructed the platelet trajectory to capture the functional plasticity and successively uncovered the distinction of platelet heterogeneity between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19. The composition of the 11 trajectory states altered in non-COVID-19 condition compared to those in COVID-19 (Fig.8C, D). Notably, state 9 is specifically expressed under COVID-19 condition but is diminished in non-COVID-19 condition (Fig.8D). We identified one major branchpoint that diverts cell fate towards state 9 by doing branch expression analysis modeling (BEAM) analysis (Fig.8E). State 9 is characterized by neutrophil chemotaxis, marked by expression of PPBP (also known as CXCL7), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-5 (CXCL5), and platelet factor-4 (PF4) (Fig.8E, Fig. S8B). Additionally, a set of marker genes encoding immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulin heavy constant-α1 (IGHA1), immunoglobulin-κ constant (IGKC), immunoglobulin-λ constant 2 (IGLC2), is enriched in cells from state 9, indicating B cell-mediated humoral responses. The expression of protein kinase C-β (PRKCB), which regulates B cell functions through the NF-κB pathway, and genes involved in maintaining oxygen affinity and oxygen transport like Hemoglobin-δ (HBD), Hemoglobin-β (HBB), Hemoglobin-α1 (HBA1), Hemoglobin-α2 (HBA2), Hemoglobin-γ2 (HBG2) and Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit-α1 (GNAI1), were also enriched in this branch (Fig. S8B). In contrast, the cell fate towards the state 7 or 8 exhibits regulation of B cell humoral immune response with the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type-6 (PTPN6) and cluster of differentiation-55 (CD55, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF)) (Fig. S8C).

To dissect the cell interaction profile, the platelet population under non-COVID-19 condition exhibits enhanced incoming interactions with NK cells, CD8+T cells, γδ-T cells, proliferating T cells, and erythrocytes. Outgoing interactions between platelets and NK cells or erythrocytes were also enhanced under non-COVID-19 condition (Fig.8F). Conversely, the interactions between platelets and CD16+monocytes or plasmablasts were downregulated under non-COVID-19 condition in both incoming and outgoing directions (Fig. S8D). Meanwhile, platelets displayed enhanced incoming interactions but reduced outgoing interactions with CD14+monocytes (Fig. S8D) in patients with non-COVID-19 infections. Of note, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, γδ-T cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) demonstrate varied interaction patterns with the six platelet subpopulations. Stress-sensitive platelets downregulated their talks toward CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells, while the rest of the platelets showed increased interactions with CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells (Fig.8F, S8D). Interestingly, platelets increased their interactions with proliferating T cells, except for the stress-sensitive platelets, in both incoming and outgoing directions under non-COVID-19 condition (Fig. S8D).

On the pathway level, non-COVID-19 samples downregulated the GP1BA pathway (Fig. S8E). The ligand-receptor pairs mediate this pathway in the GP1BA molecule expressed on platelets binding to the integrin complex CD11b/CD18 (MAC-1) expressed on NK cells and CD14+monocytes (Fig.8G). The interaction between GP1BA and MAC-1 is known to enhance platelet activation and aggregation and facilitate the formation of platelet plugs [63]. It is noteworthy that under non-COVID-19 condition, platelets muted the GP1BA signaling with NK cells (Fig.8G). The increased engagement between platelets and NK cells during COVID-19 potentially contribute to the hyper-inflammatory state observed in severe cases of the disease. The adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E5 (ADGRE5) pathway is specifically expressed under COVID-19 condition between immature platelets and other immune cells (Fig. S8E). This interaction is mediated by the ligand-receptor pairs ADGRE5 molecule expressed on immune cells and CD55 expressed on immature platelets (Fig. S8F). ADGRE5 and CD55 interaction is pivotal in the modulation of immune responses, inflammation, and cell adhesion [64]. CD55, as a key regulator of the complement system, primarily inhibits the formation of C3/C5 convertases, thereby preventing excessive complement activation and protecting immune cells from complement-mediated damage [65].

Platelets, derived from megakaryocytes, are the most abundant blood cells that serve dual roles in blood coagulation and immune modulation [66]. Once believed to be uniform, platelets are now known to demonstrate heterogeneity in size, age, receptor expression, and responsiveness to agonist stimulation [67]. Upon entering the bloodstream, the phenotypes and functions of circulating platelets are intricately influenced by a range of endogenous ligands [68]. However, investigation on platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections remain insufficient. We believe this is the first study to systematically resolve platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections while interrogating its modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments.

This study annotates the essential platelet subpopulations that contribute to the severity of respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients. From the quantitatively expanded platelet population in severe COVID-19, a enrichment of platelet subpopulations characterized by heightened innate immune responsiveness and increased coagulation potential was identified, which confirms the role of platelets as a critical interface between viral pathogenesis and thromboinflammatory cascades [7]. Some of the platelet signatures identified in this study align with previously reported platelet profiles. Of note, the elevated oxidative phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling, observed in fatal sepsis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [22], are signature features of the stress-sensitive platelet subpopulation we identified, which is rare in healthy individuals but expands significantly in COVID-19. Furthermore, the immunothrombotic platelet subpopulation we identified exhibits transcriptional profiles and a disease severity-associated role analogous to the hyperactivated platelets observed in fatal sepsis [18,22], which is mechanistically linked to thromboinflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

The dysregulation of platelet-immune cell crosstalk in severe COVID-19 reveals a potential immunothrombotic switch mechanism. Notably, platelet subpopulations exhibit enhanced communication with neutrophils while their interactions with NK cells are markedly suppressed. This bidirectional modulation aligns with the observed neutrophilia [69] and NK cell exhaustion in critical cases [70,71], suggesting platelets may amplify neutrophil-driven inflammation while evading NK cell surveillance. Furthermore, the MHC-I pathway undergoes a target cell shift from NK to T cells, implying that platelet-mediated antigen presentation might preferentially activate adaptive immunity over innate cytotoxicity. Such immune redirection could reflect viral evasion strategies or compensatory responses to lymphopenia [15], warranting further investigation into platelet-MHC-I dynamics in viral persistence. Gene co-expression network analysis further dissects platelet functional heterogeneity, identifying six modules, that not only stratify disease severity but also highlight sex/age-dependent transcriptional programs, potentially explaining the reported demographic disparities in thrombosis risk [36]. Trajectory analysis uncovers a COVID-19-specific platelet state (State 9) with dual roles: it orchestrates neutrophil chemotaxis and paradoxically supports B cell responses through CD40LG-CD40 axis activation. This hybrid phenotype likely drives immunopathology by dysregulating thromboinflammation and humoral defense in COVID-19 [16].

While we delineated the distinct functional plasticity between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 conditions by trajectory analysis, one limitation of this study is that the exploration of non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illnesses is preliminary. We focused our inspection on COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 stratification without further categorizing the non-COVID-19 cohort into specific respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, bacterial pneumonia, or other viral etiologies). Besides, due to the inherent challenges in obtaining well-defined severe cases caused by non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens, we acknowledge that the non-COVID-19 cohort is limited in sample size, rendering its exploration preliminary despite satisfying the statistical requirements for this study. This prompts us to conduct a thorough comparative analysis in our future research, with the larger and pathogen-stratified non-COVID-19 cohort, to enhance generalizability and elucidate pathogen-specific platelet heterogeneity. In addition, future studies incorporating flow cytometry and downstream functional experiments are warranted to investigate the translation and functional consequences of the transcriptomic signatures delineated in this study.

Dexamethasone and tocilizumab improve survival in severe COVID-19 [23,24], but their platelet-specific effects during respiratory inflammation remain unclear. Our study elucidated how these treatments modulate the interactions between platelets and immune cells, an aspect largely unexplored in prior single-cell studies [19–22]. We observed that the interactions between immunothrombotic platelets and immune cells were repressed remarkably after dexamethasone administration, potentially limiting thromboinflammatory damage. Conversely, immune platelet-B and stress-sensitive platelet subpopulations upregulated their communications after dexamethasone administration. The persistence of immune platelet-B and stress-sensitive subsets post-treatment underscores their potential as residual thrombotic triggers, warranting longitudinal studies to assess long-term vascular complications in long-COVID symptoms [5]. Tocilizumab, targeting IL-6 receptors, attenuates platelets’ crosstalk with IFN-activated CD8+T cells (identified by markers CD69+CD25+CD38+[30]), consistent with its therapeutic effect on T cell hyperactivation [72], and potentially curbing T cell-mediated tissue damage. However, the enhancement of platelet interactions with memory B and CD4+T cells after tocilizumab treatment suggests a compensatory pivot toward adaptive immunity, where platelets may act as antigen-presenting scaffolds to reinforce viral-specific responses. This duality of platelets as both thromboinflammatory triggers and immune coordinators underscores their central role in shaping therapeutic outcomes.

We systematically investigated the six platelet subpopulations under varied respiratory disease conditions and delineated dexamethasone and tocilizumab therapeutic modulation on platelet heterogeneity. On the one hand, this multifaceted heterogeneity investigation paves the way to uncover the immune roles of circulating platelets during respiratory infections and therapeutic modulation by elucidating their active communications with immune cells. On the other hand, platelet heterogeneity provides critical insights into the mechanism involved in thromboembolic complications which is closely related to the severity and progression of respiratory inflammation. This detailed landscape offers a resource for future identification of prognosis markers and therapeutic targets for thromboembolic complications.

In conclusion, this study examines platelet single-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory inflammation, particularly in severe COVID-19, and its modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments. It identifies key subpopulations with heightened immune-coagulation activity, details their interactions with immune cells, and contrasts COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19 platelet dynamics. These findings advance prognostic marker discovery and therapeutic targeting of thromboembolic complications.
