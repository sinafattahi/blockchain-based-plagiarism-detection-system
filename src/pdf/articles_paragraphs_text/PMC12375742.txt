This work presents a self-healing system designed for smart distribution networks, integrating fault detection, isolation, and power restoration with optimal network reconfiguration. Leveraging the Backward/Forward Sweep method for load flow analysis. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for distributed generation sizing and location is used to improve the voltage profile for buses. The proposed design is validated on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system using MATLAB/Simulink and CYME software. Simulation results demonstrate a swift service restoration time, a reduction in power losses post-fault with two distributed generators, and an improved minimum voltage. This work enhances network reliability for the customers, voltage stability, and operational efficiency, offering a feasible and practical solution for investment in modern smart grids.

The increasing complexity of modern electricity distribution systems, coupled with rising energy demands and environmental concerns, has necessitated a paradigm shift from traditional power grids to smart grids. Smart grids leverage advanced technologies to enhance the safety, reliability, and efficiency of power delivery, integrating distributed generation (DG), renewable energy sources, and real-time control mechanism1,2. A key feature of smart grids is their ability to support two-way power flow, enabling distributed energy resources to complement centralized power generation. However, this evolution introduces new challenges, particularly in managing bidirectional power flows and ensuring system stability under fault conditions3. Traditional protection and control strategies designed for unidirectional power flow in radial networks are often inadequate for these dynamic systems, necessitating innovative approaches to fault management and service restoration.

Self-healing which is a cornerstone of smart grid technology, refers to the capability of a distribution network to autonomously detect, isolate, and recover from faults, thereby minimizing outages and enhancing system dependability4,5. This concept has gained significant attention in light of the increasing pressures facing energy systems around the world due to climate change, aging infrastructure, and the integration of renewable energy sources6. Self-healing systems use advanced sensing, communications, and control technologies to isolate faulty components, reconfigure the grid, and restore power to healthy areas with minimal human intervention7.

Figure1illustrates a self-healing protection system that uses measuring devices and sensors to deliver electrical power to customers efficiently while maintaining high quality. These sensors are capable of detecting signals that indicate faults in the power lines of the network. The sensors form clusters and establish direct links to the main controller via a wireless connection. Multiple clusters communicate wirelessly with the main controller, enabling smooth grid operation. In the event of a fault, the system responds quickly to restore affected branches, ensuring a rapid recovery process.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of self-healing to reduce outage durations and improve power quality, particularly in active distribution networks with embedded DGs8,9. For instance, Torres et al.10proposed a distributed intelligence system for self-healing, leveraging localized switch communication to handle complex fault scenarios, validated on real-world networks, demonstrating its efficacy in large-scale networks, while Shirazi et al.3. introduced an agent-based framework to optimize service restoration. Dong Li Jia et al.11proposed a layered architecture (base, support, application) and defined five operational states: normal, warning, critical, emergency, and recovery. This structure enhances outage management by enabling proactive fault mitigation. Elmitwally et al.12introduced a Multi-Agent Control System (MACS) to address voltage violations, feeder congestion, and reactive power coordination, demonstrating its efficacy in smart grids. Xu et al.13developed a greedy algorithm to optimize remote-controlled switch placement, improving restoration capability with near-optimal solutions for large-scale networks. Zadsar et al.14presented a two-layer algorithm integrating microgrids and direct load control, minimizing switching costs and load shedding while enhancing reliability. Zhao et al.15introduces a specialized optimization model through case studies on modified IEEE 33-node and 123-node networks. A binary hybrid algorithm is proposed to optimize switch states and DG operation modes, achieving minimal load curtailment, network losses, and voltage deviations, with demonstrated superior accuracy compared to BQPSO and BFOA solvers. The method effectively restores faulty ADNs to normal operation with minimal power losses.

Despite these advancements, significant research gaps remain. Many existing self-healing strategies focus on theoretical frameworks or small-scale simulations, with limited emphasis on practical implementation in real-world radial distribution systems16,17. Furthermore, the integration of DGs into self-healing processes introduces additional complexity, as their optimal placement and sizing must be carefully considered to maximize restoration efficiency and minimize power losses11,13,18. Generally, among the methods available, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) performs well and converges faster than alternatives like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)19.

Studies show that PSO, GA, and WOA all reduce voltage deviations to below 0.05 p.u. across buses and significantly reduce power losses. However, PSO stands out for its speed, due to its swarm-based approach that efficiently shares information between particles. The GA, on the other hand, takes longer because it depends on evolutionary processes like selection, crossover, and mutation. While slower, GA is more robust and better suited for complex problems where thoroughness matters more than speed. The WOA offers similar performance to PSO, balancing exploration and exploitation, but its convergence time is sensitive to parameter tuning. Newer metaheuristics, such as Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), show comparable results but are less studied in this context.

For the IEEE 33-bus system, PSO is one of the better optimization strategies used to resolve power system problems by increasing or decreasing the number of objective functions20,21. This technique is used to optimize the number and location of the required DGs in the IEEE-33 bus system in this research, as a MATLAB code22. The economic and operational feasibility of such systems, particularly under varying fault scenarios and load conditions, also warrants further investigation23.

Against this backdrop, this study proposes a novel self-healing methodology for smart distribution networks, utilizing the IEEE 33-bus test system as a benchmark. By combining the Backward/Forward Sweep load flow method with PSO for DG placement, this research aims to achieve rapid fault isolation, optimal network reconfiguration, and maximum power restoration while adhering to operational constraints. The proposed approach advances the state-of-the-art by offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution, validated through simulations in MATLAB and CYME software, with implications for enhancing the resilience of modern power distribution systems.

The simulation of a power distribution network was performed using MATLAB R2017b and CYME 9.0, with the IEEE 33-bus test system adopted as the reference topology. The CYME-based simulation entailed a systematic process, including the use of an equipment library, integration of load data with precise geospatial assignments, and specification of all components essential for power flow analysis, including line and load specifications, unbalanced load conditions, and fault calculations, thereby enhancing the accuracy of network simulations. It conducts load flow and power loss analyses using various sweep methods to determine voltage profiles and current magnitudes across the IEEE 33-bus system under diverse operating conditions. Furthermore, it supports the validation of restoration strategies through reliability metrics and provides limited real-time simulation capabilities. The load and line data for the IEEE 33-bus system are listed in Table124.

CYME offers improved modeling accuracy and validation capabilities through its specialized distribution modeling features and adherence to standard performance metrics, thereby complementing the study’s PSO-based optimization approach and self-healing system design and simulation utilizing MATLAB/Simulink.

Load flow analysis of the initial configuration revealed that the feeder was operating under abnormal conditions, with 19 sections experiencing under-voltage issues.

The research methodology was structured into three distinct phases: First, a load flow analysis was conducted to determine the voltage profiles and current magnitudes across the IEEE 33-bus system under steady-state conditions. The second phase focused on optimizing the sizing and placement of distributed generators (DGs) within the same test system to eliminate the under-voltage issues, employing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in MATLAB. Finally, the third phase investigated the implementation of a self-healing protection scheme within a smart grid framework, applied to the IEEE 33-bus system both with and without DGs, leveraging the combined capabilities of MATLAB R2017b and CYME 9.0 to assess system performance and resilience.

The IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system, operating at 12.66 kV, serves as the testbed25. It comprises 33 buses, 32 sectional switches (Sw-1 to Sw-32, normally closed), and 5 tie switches (Sw-33 to Sw-37, normally open), with a total load of 3715 kW active and 2300 kVAR reactive power. The feeder’s current capacity is 208.6 A, with initial power losses of 202.66 kW and a minimum voltage of 0.91 p.u. at bus 1726. Figure2depicts the single-line diagram of the system, illustrating its radial topology and switch locations.

Load flow analysis for the IEEE 33-bus distribution system can be conducted using either MATLAB-based codes or CYME software. To assess result accuracy and performance, this study investigates three methods: the Backward/Forward Sweep, Newton-Raphson, and Gauss-Seidel techniques.

The Newton-Raphson method is known for its fast (quadratic) convergence and high accuracy, but it involves significant computational effort due to the repeated calculation and inversion of the Jacobian matrix. The Gauss-Seidel method, while simpler and more memory-efficient, is better suited for smaller systems due to its slower convergence rate27. Both methods, however, face limitations when applied to radial distribution systems, primarily due to high R/X ratios and convergence difficulties.

In contrast, CYME software offers a more efficient and practical solution for radial systems. It includes specialized load flow analysis tools designed to accommodate the specific characteristics of distribution networks, providing accurate results with reduced computational complexity.

The current flowing through the load line in the grid has allowable limits and represents another constraint13.

By leveraging PSO-based DG placement and dynamic network reconfiguration, the system maintains voltage stability, minimizes losses, and ensures reliable service restoration under varying load and generation conditions. The adaptive control strategy is capable of responding to the unpredictable nature of power flow directions by dynamically adjusting switch states and load paths. Furthermore, the consideration of DG output in the reconfiguration logic enhances the system’s ability to manage reverse or bidirectional power flow, prevent undervoltage and overvoltage conditions, and maintain balanced feeder loading.

The bus voltages of the system in its original configuration during normal operation were calculated using the Backward/Forward Sweep load flow method, as shown in Fig.4. The results, computed in MATLAB R2017b and CYME and presented in Table2, align closely with those obtained from the Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel methods. Figure4illustrates the voltage profile of the IEEE 33-bus test system derived from the Backward/Forward Sweep method, alongside a comparison with results from other methods. Initial load flow analysis revealed under-voltage in 19 sections (< 0.95 p.u.), with a minimum of 0.90 p.u. at bus 17 and losses of 202.66 kW.

To minimize active power losses, the proposed method employs the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to determine the optimal number, sizes, and locations of distributed generators (DGs). Figure5visually compares power losses across different DG deployment scenarios, indicating that using two DGs is the most effective choice. The PSO algorithm identifies bus bars 6 and 32 as the optimal locations for these DGs.

Load flow analysis conducted after distributed generation (DG) placement revealed that section 6 requires 1310.805 kVA per phase, and section 32 requires 873.8701 kVA per phase. Table3summarizes the load conditions before and after reactive power compensation. Initially, the system exhibited a minimum voltage of 0.90 per unit, as confirmed by load flow analysis. Following optimal DG placement, the system losses decreased to 71.85 kW, with the minimum voltage reaching 0.97 per unit at bus 17. Figure6illustrates the enhanced voltage profile, highlighting DG benefits30.

In this work, to apply the self-healing methodology on the IEEE 33-bus test system using CYME software, the fault was chosen to be simulated in Sect. 8 because of the ability of fault isolation and multiple choices to reconfigure the network and restore power to this area using fewer numbers of switches. This study investigates a three-phase short-circuit fault introduced in the transmission line between bus-bar 8 and bus-bar 9 of the IEEE 33-bus distribution network. This type of fault is classified as a big disturbance due to its substantial impact on voltage profiles, power flow, and overall system stability. In contrast to small disturbances, such as small load variations or single-phase faults, a three-phase fault necessitates complex network reconfiguration. The proposed self-healing approach proves the ability to manage such a fault effectively.

As soon as a fault occurs on the line between bus bar 8 and bus bar 9, the protection relay located at bus 8 opens the switch (Sw-8) to isolate the rest of the line to prevent the fault from affecting the healthy lines located before the fault location, thereby avoiding a shutdown of the entire power distribution network. As a consequence, the power to Sects. 8 to 17 is disrupted, as depicted in Fig.7. The self-healing protection system responds by opening the switch (Sw-9) to isolate and clear the faulty line completely.

Fault Detection and Isolation: Sensors monitor voltage and detect anomalies (e.g., a fault in Sect. 8). The control unit triggers the relay (Sw-8 opens) to isolate the faulty line, interrupting 815 kW across Sects. 8–1723.

Network Reconfiguration: Optimal switching (open Sw-9, close Sw-35) minimizes losses and balances load, maintaining radiality31.

Power Restoration: Tie switches (Sw-35) close to reroute power, restoring service total, leveraging automated control signals10.

To achieve optimal network reconfiguration and power restoration, voltage drop areas were addressed by strategically deploying distributed generators (DGs) with calculated power ratings and locations. Figure8illustrates the optimal switching plan for the IEEE 33-bus system, which restores power to feeders 9 through 17 via switch Sw-35 after isolating the fault in Sect. 8 using DGs.

The self-healing process for the power distribution network is summarized in a detailed flowchart, presented in Fig.9, which systematically outlines the sequential steps involved in the self-healing mechanism.

The self-healing methodology was applied to the IEEE 33-bus test system using CYME software, with a fault simulated in Sect. 8 due to its suitability for fault isolation and multiple reconfiguration options to restore power with minimal switch operations. The self-healing protection system responds by opening switches Sw-8 and Sw-9 to isolate the fault, resulting in a power disruption to Sects. 8 through 17, as shown in Fig.7. This outage affects a total unserved consumer load of 815 kW.

Network reconfiguration was effectively carried out using self-healing techniques to strategically manage switch operations, ensuring optimal load transfer and power restoration for consumers affected by the outage in Sect. 8. The optimal setup for Sect. 8 involves opening switch Sw-9 and closing the normally open tie switch Sw-35, as outlined in Table4, for scenarios both with and without distributed generation (DG). This configuration facilitates the transfer of 815 kW through the tie line switches after fault isolation. The resulting network layouts are illustrated in Fig.8.

In this study, the simulation framework for evaluating self-healing mechanisms in power distribution networks is developed using MATLAB/Simulink, with the IEEE 33-bus test system serving as the foundational topology. This section delineates the configuration of the simulation environment, encompassing the hardware and software infrastructure, alongside a comprehensive description of the model components, including bus configurations, load profiles, power sources, and switching mechanisms.

Central to the simulation is the control unit model, precisely designed in MATLAB/Simulink to coordinate the operation of smart protection devices. The Simulink model represents the dynamic behavior of these devices, offering a graphical representation of their interactions within the distribution network. Key components include bus signal blocks, which emulate protective relays with configurable parameters such as overcurrent settings, time delays, and trip characteristics; circuit breaker blocks, which model the response to fault conditions through controlled opening and closing actions; and switch blocks, which simulate network reconfiguration by isolating faulty segments or redirecting power flow. The control unit block integrates decision-making algorithms, processing inputs from sensors and relays to execute coordinated actions, such as fault isolation or power restoration.

Additionally, a measurement unit block collects and processes real-time system data, providing critical inputs for the control unit’s decision-making process. This model facilitates the simulation of diverse fault scenarios, enabling thorough analysis of device coordination, response times, and the overall efficacy of the smart protection system in enhancing the reliability and stability of the distribution network. Figure10shows the Simulink control unit, integrating relays, breakers, and switches.

(b) The bus current and voltage monitoring components in the measurement system unit. (c) The logic unit model diagram in the control system.

The self-healing approach was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink using protective devices capable of receiving remote commands to respond rapidly to faults. In this scenario, a fault is simulated in Sect. 8, as shown in Fig.11. When the fault occurs, the current exceeds its rated limit, prompting the monitoring unit to detect the abnormal current surge. This triggers a signal to the comparison unit, which evaluates the currents in each feeder segment against the relay settings. To isolate the fault, the comparison unit sends a signal to switch Sw-8, which opens within 0.02 s. Consequently, the power supply to Sects. 8 through 17 is disrupted, resulting in an unserved consumer load of 815 kW.

The IEEE 33 bus test system is supported with 2 DGs Simulink mode.

Figure12demonstrates that when implementing the self-healing process without distributed generators (DGs), the minimum voltage of 0.90 p.u. presented at bus 17, and the system losses calculated to be 144.97 kW. With the integration of DGs, the minimum voltage improved to 0.973 p.u. at bus 17, and the losses were substantially reduced to 48.6 kW as detailed in Table4. Figure12presents the post-fault voltage profile, while Fig.13compares branch currents.

Voltage profile before/after fault isolation with DG.

Figure13offers the voltage profile before/after activation of the fault event in the self-healing system. The pre-fault voltage at bus 9, steady at 0.984 p.u., demonstrates the enhanced steady-state condition achieved through optimal DGs placement. Following the fault, the voltage stabilizes at 0.972 p.u. The slight voltage reduction at bus 9 is due to load redistribution and line impedance effects post-reconfiguration, yet it remains within the acceptable range of 0.95–1.05 p.u. Additionally, Fig.13indicates that the post-restoration minimum system voltage is 0.94 p.u. at bus 32. This robust dynamic response highlights the system’s capability to maintain voltage stability during fault conditions, reinforcing its reliability as a key feature of a smart grid.

Figure14illustrates the branch current loading in the IEEE 33-bus system under two conditions: normal operation and post-fault isolation. During normal operation, the main feeder carries a load current of 106.2 A per phase. Following a fault in section 8 and the subsequent self-healing process with fault isolation, the total recovered load current across the 33-bus system reduces to 74.6 A per phase, as detailed in Table5.

Simulation results before and after fault isolation and service restoration using 2DGs.

Figure15displays a time-domain plot of the voltage magnitude at bus 9 during a fault in Sect. 8, simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis shows the voltage value in per unit (p.u.). Before the fault, the voltage was stable at approximately 0.98 p.u., reflecting the improved voltage profile due to DGs placed at buses 6 and 32.

At the fault onset (t= 0.1 s.), the voltage drops sharply due to the disturbance. Within 0.02 s., the fault is detected and isolated by opening switch Sw-8, resulting in a transient voltage dip. The self-healing process then activates, opening switch Sw-9 and closing switch Sw-35 to restore power. Att= 0.16 s, the voltage stabilizes at approximately 0.97 p.u., confirming successful power restoration. This rapid recovery, achieved within 60 ms, highlights the effectiveness of the control unit and DG support in mitigating voltage sags and ensuring system stability. During the fault event, the self-healing approach underscores the system’s capability to maintain stability and ensure reliable power restoration. The self-healing system significantly reduced overall power losses by 76% (from 202.66 kW to 48.6 kW).

Although direct comparisons with other studies are limited by the lack of standardized benchmarks for the IEEE 33-bus system, Table6compares the quantitative performance of the proposed self-healing framework based on PSO for DG placement with related works in the literature. The comparison includes voltage-profile improvement, loss reduction, and service restoration time. Additionally, a comparison between the base case load conditions before and after optimal DG placement is presented in Table3.

Comparison of the proposed work with other works on a 33-bus system.

The proposed self-healing mechanism demonstrates robust performance under varying load conditions and fault scenarios, including multi-point faults and real-time load variations, through its adaptive control strategy and optimized network reconfiguration. It adapts to different load conditions through PSO-based DG placement and network reconfiguration, ensuring voltage stability and minimizing losses.

In fault scenarios, the system effectively handles single-point faults and is also capable of managing multi-point faults using the same control strategy. It utilizes automated switching and centralized control functions for monitoring, fault detection, isolation, and reconfiguration, all managed by a central control unit through fully controlled switches. Specifically, only three switches are used per fault: one bus-bar switch is tripped to isolate the faulty section based on a protection relay signal; the next downstream bus-bar switch is automatically tripped to isolate the faulty line; and finally, the tie switch is closed automatically to restore service to the healthy sections.

This work developed a MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation model for self-healing in power distribution networks, using the IEEE 33-bus test system as a test case. The simulation model is designed to integrate smart protection relays, circuit breakers, and switches, which are coordinated by a control unit for rapid fault response. A fault assumed to occur in Sect. 8 was detected by smart measuring sensors and isolated within 0.02 s by opening switch Sw-8, resulting in an outage of 815 kW of load across Sects. 8–17. The proposed self-healing process restored power by reconfiguring switches Sw-9 and Sw-35, the voltage at bus 9 stabilized to 0.947 p.u. within 60 milliseconds. The overall post-fault power losses reduction achieved from 202.66 kW to 48.6 kW (76%). The system demonstrates enhanced reliability and stability supported by distributed generators, as observed through Simulink’s real-time data processing and measurements. The fast response and power recovery highlight the excellent performance of the control unit in eliminating voltage drops, reducing line outage time, and ensuring network resilience and reliability.
