This study focused on extracting and preconcentrating lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) fromLawsonia inermisleaves to develop an advanced antibacterial polymer wound dressing designed to prevent infections and enhance wound healing. Utilizing biocompatible cellulose acetate as the base polymer, the material was combined with Ag-MOF (silver-metal-organic frameworks) to serve as a nano-carrier for the controlled release of lawsone. Extraction was performed via maceration and QuEChERS methods, with HPLC and UV-Vis spectrophotometry confirming a significantly higher lawsone yield from QuEChERS (57.218 ppm) than maceration (8.205 ppm). Spectrophotometric analysis identified water as the optimal solvent, with QuEChERS achieving an 83% dry extract efficiency. The wound dressings exhibited exceptional hydrophilicity (contact angles of 39.7° for QuEChERS and 57.2° for maceration), high moisture absorption (63% equilibrium rate, 79.42% water fraction), and effective antibacterial activity, particularly againstStaphylococcus aureus(17.5 mm inhibition zone for maceration-based extract). Sustained release profiling indicated peak extract concentration (934.124 ppm) after 24 h, while structural analyses (XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM) confirmed optimal physicochemical properties. These findings demonstrate the dressing’s superior exudate management, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial efficacy, positioning it as a promising therapeutic solution for wound care.

Living organisms, particularly humans, are constantly exposed to skin damage1. As the body’s first line of defense against environmental pathogens and external stressors, the skin plays a critical protective role2. When skin integrity is compromised due to abrasions, chemical exposure, or microbial invasion, prompt and effective wound coverage becomes essential. The wound-healing process begins immediately after injury and progresses through distinct phases, the duration of which depends on the severity of the damage3. However, this process can be significantly influenced by extrinsic factors, including oxygenation levels, infection risk, and localized biochemical conditions4. Conventional wound dressings often fall short of addressing key therapeutic requirements. Their limitations include poor adhesion, insufficient moisture regulation, inefficient drug delivery, and a lack of controlled release mechanisms. These shortcomings can lead to the rapid degradation of bioactive compounds, inconsistent treatment efficacy, and increased susceptibility to bacterial colonization—factors that may delay healing or precipitate secondary infections. Given these challenges, there remains a pressing need for advanced wound care solutions. An ideal dressing should exhibit biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and the ability to maintain a moist wound environment while offering antimicrobial protection and controlled drug release5–8. Notably,Staphylococcusspp. are among the most prevalent pathogenic bacteria implicated in wound infections. Other common causative agents includeStaphylococcus aureus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Acinetobacter baumannii,Proteus mirabilis,Escherichia coli, andCorynebacteriumspp9–11. These pathogens have been extensively documented in studies on acute and chronic wound infections, underscoring the need for targeted antimicrobial strategies in wound management12–14.

Providing suitable wound coverage to protect against infection is a critical medical necessity15. An ideal wound dressing should exhibit durability, elasticity, water vapor permeability, and antibacterial properties—features that not only enhance wound protection but also actively promote the healing process. These functional requirements have driven the development of diverse wound dressing materials. Consequently, researchers have turned to natural substances as promising solutions for effective wound treatment. Among emerging innovations, nano-fibrous scaffolds composed of polymeric materials have shown significant potential16. Cellulose, in particular, has attracted considerable attention due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, and abundance as a renewable, cost-effective resource17. However, a challenge limiting its biomedical application is its poor solubility in common organic solvents, a result of its extensive intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. To address this limitation, scientists have explored modified cellulose derivatives as viable alternatives18. One of the most pivotal polymers for biomedical applications is cellulose acetate (CA), a semi-crystalline polymer renowned for its biocompatibility, chemical stability, hydrophilicity, and widespread availability19. However, its limited mechanical properties hinder broader utilization20. Conventional wound treatments, such as D-panthenol (risk of skin inflammation), silver sulfadiazine (severe skin reactions), and tetracycline ointments (risk of hearing loss, nausea, and vomiting), often pose significant side effects. Even alpha ointment, used in severe cases, can induce intense itching during wound healing21. Consequently, medicinal plant extracts have gained prominence as safer alternatives due to their high biocompatibility and minimal adverse effects22.

Among these, polymeric nanofibers infused with herbal extracts have emerged as highly effective wound dressings, leveraging their bioactive properties23. Plant-derived secondary metabolites, in particular, exhibit lower toxicity and potent biological activity, making them promising candidates for wound management24. Notable examples includeAloe vera,Malva sylvestris,Camellia sinensis,Matricaria chamomilla, andLawsonia inermis25–27.Lawsonia inermis, a member of the Lythraceae family28is especially noteworthy due to its antioxidant, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, and anticancer properties29,30. Its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects make it highly effective in treating burns, skin infections, and wounds31–34. Remarkably,Lawsonia inermisextract demonstrates efficacy comparable to common antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline, gentamicin, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin) in combating skin infections35. Phytochemical analyses reveal thatLawsonia inermiscontains over 100 bioactive compounds, including naphthoquinones, quinoids, phenolic glycosides, flavonoids (luteolin, apigenin), and coumarins (scopoletin, umbelliferone)36. Its essential oils contain ionones (e.g., β-ionone)37. The primary active compound, lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), constitutes 1–1.4% ofLawsonia inermisleaves and serves as a natural dye38. Beyond its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, lawsone inhibits macrophage activity and aids in fingerprint detection39–41underscoring its versatility and therapeutic potential37.

Given its broad applications, efficient extraction methods are crucial. Traditional techniques—supercritical fluid extraction, ultrasonication, microwave-assisted extraction, maceration, and Soxhlet extraction—are widely used42,43. However, many suffer from high solvent consumption, incomplete extraction, and environmental toxicity44. Thus, innovative, eco-friendly methods are needed to enhance efficiency while minimizing chemical use45,46. The tissue solid-phase dispersion (TSPD) extraction method offers a rapid, low-solvent approach for isolating and preconcentrating analytes from complex matrices47. Its success hinges on selecting optimal adsorbents (e.g., silica gel, activated carbon, alumina, polymeric/nano-adsorbents)48, optimizing solid-phase-to-sample ratios49,50and choosing solvents tailored to target compounds51.

Similarly, the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) method—a salting-out extraction coupled with dispersive SPE—has gained traction due to its adaptability and efficiency52. However, its performance depends on analyte properties, matrix composition, and available analytical techniques53. The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has spurred the development of micro- and nano-platforms for controlled drug release, maximizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects54. These systems enhance drug half-life, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics while reducing dosing frequency55. Nanocarriers fall into three categories56,57: Organic (e.g., liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, protein-based nanoparticles) – biocompatible, ligand-conjugatable58,59. Inorganic (e.g., carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, mesoporous silica, gold nanoparticles) –precisely tunable, synergistic therapeutic effects60,61. Hybrid (e.g., lipid-polymer hybrids, metal-organic frameworks [MOFs]) – combines advantages of organic/inorganic materials62–65. MOF-based nanocarriers, in particular, have shown exceptional promise in biomolecule delivery66,67. While their biomedical applications have been extensively reviewed, few studies explore their dual role as biosensors and multi-disease drug carriers59.

The following chemicals were used in this study: magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄), sodium chloride (NaCl), zirconium chloride octahydrate (ZrCl₄·8 H₂O), terephthalic acid (C₈H₆O₄), dimethylformamide (DMF), sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), triethanolamine (TEA), ethanol (C₂H₅OH), methanol (CH₃OH), silver nitrate (AgNO₃), tannic acid (C₇₆H₅₂O₄₆), cellulose acetate, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), benzenedicarboxylic acid, diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, iron(II) chloride (FeCl₂), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄), potassium chloride (KCl), potassium acetate (CH₃COOK), aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl₃·6 H₂O), TPTZ (2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine), distilled water (H₂O), and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Lawsonia inermiswas sourced from Qaleh Ganj County, a principal production region in Iran. The taxonomic identities of theLawsonia inermisplant were authenticated by the Medicinal and Industrial Research Institute, Ardakan, Dr. R. Zareshahi and deposited in the herbarium of institute (voucher specimen no. SSU 0066). The aerial parts were harvested at the blooming stage (August 2021) and transported to the laboratory for processing. The plant material was shade-dried at 25–30 °C for one week and protected from direct sunlight. After drying, the leaves were separated and ground into fine powder using a laboratory mill (IKA A11 Basic). The resulting powder was sieved through a 100-mesh sieve to ensure uniformity before further experimentation.

In this method, 1 g of pre-groundLawsonia inermisplant material was immersed in 6 ml distilled water and macerated on a magnetic stirrer (700 rpm) for 24 h at room temperature (27 °C), protected from light68.

To prepare UiO-66, 0.5 g of zirconium chloride (ZrCl₈), 0.25 g of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (BDC), 0.70 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF), and 0.5 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl) were combined in a 100 mL beaker. The mixture was stirred magnetically for 5 min until homogeneous, then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 24 h. The resulting white UiO-66 product was washed repeatedly with ethanol, separated via centrifugation, and dried at 100 °C for 24 h. To homogenize, the material was mixed on a magnetic stirrer without temperature for 5 min (700 rpm). It was also washed 4 times with ethanol by centrifugation at 7000 rpm69–72.

ALawsonia inermisleaf extract was prepared by suspending 1 g of dried leaves in 6 mL of distilled water and stirring magnetically (700 rpm) for 10 min. Subsequently, 0.5 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0.6 g of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) were added, followed by vortexing for 1 min. Next, 0.05 g of UiO-66-MOFs and 1 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) were introduced, and the mixture was centrifuged (7000 rpm) for 3 min to isolate the purified extract73.

TheLawsonia inermisextract was analyzed using a Kenavar HPLC system equipped with a UV-VIS 2550 detector and a Zorbax SB-C18 column (250 mm × 3.9 mm, 5 μm particle size). The mobile phase consisted of methanol and water (80:20 v/v) at 0.1 mL/min. Detection was performed at 280 nm with a 20 µL injection volume. A calibration curve was constructed using standard lawsone solutions (0.5–200 mg/L), and sample concentrations were determined in triplicate74.

The phenolic content ofLawsonia inermisextract was quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Briefly, 500 µL of the FC reagent (10% v/v) was mixed with 100 µL of each extract (1 mg/mL) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature (27 °C) in the dark. Subsequently, 400 µL of sodium carbonate (7.5% w/v) was added, and the resulting solution was incubated under the same conditions for 60 min. The absorbance of the samples was then measured at 765 nm. Gallic acid was used as the standard, and the phenolic content was expressed as micrograms of gallic acid equivalent per milligram of dry weight (µg GAE/mg). All measurements were performed in at least duplicate76.

The total flavonoid content of the extracts was determined using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method. Briefly, 500 µL of each extract (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 10 µL of aluminum chloride (10% w/v) and 50 µL of sodium nitrite (10% w/v). The solution was incubated for 6 min at room temperature (27 °C) in the dark, followed by the addition of 500 µL of sodium hydroxide (4% w/v). After thorough mixing, the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min under the same conditions. Absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer. Quercetin was used as the standard, and the flavonoid content was expressed as micrograms of quercetin equivalent per milligram of dry weight (µg QE/mg)77.

Solution A: 10 mM TPTZ (2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine) in 40 mM hydrochloric acid-Solution B: 20 mM FeCl₃ - Solution C: 300 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.6.).

A volume of 1.5 mL of the FRAP working solution was combined with 50 µL of the herbal extract (1 mg/mL) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Absorbance was measured at 593 nm. A standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of FeSO₄ (1 mM), and results were reported as µmol Fe²⁺ per gram of extract (µmol Fe²⁺/g)78.

The silver-based metal-organic framework- tannic acid (Ag-MOF-TA) was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. A mixture of 0.37 g silver nitrate, 0.72 g terephthalic acid, and 0.25 g tannic acid was dissolved in 44 mL of dimethylformamide and heated in an autoclave at 120 °C for 36 h. The resulting black precipitate was isolated by centrifugation. It was also washed 4 times with ethanol by centrifugation at 7000 rpm and dried at 80 °C for 12 hr79.

FTIR spectroscopy (4000–400 cm⁻¹, resolution: 4 cm⁻¹) was employed to analyze functional groups and structural changes in the MOF)metal-organic framework) and cellulose film before and after extract loading. Samples were ground, mixed with KBr, and pressed into disks for analysis80.

XRD was performed to assess the crystalline structure and phase composition of the synthesized MOF, both in its pure form and after incorporation into the film79.

Morphological characterization of nanoparticles and film surfaces was conducted using FE-SEM (Quanta FEG 450, China). Samples were sputter-coated with gold before imaging, and micrographs were acquired at 30 kV with a magnification of ×50081.

The cellulose scaffold was prepared using the phase inversion method. First, 0.5 g of cellulose powder was mixed with 3 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and heated at 80 °C under continuous stirring (500 rpm) for 5 min. Subsequently, 0.04 g of silver nitrate-tannic acid MOF (Ag-MOF-TA) was added to the mixture, which was then stirred (500 rpm) for 3 h at 80 °C until a homogeneous gel formed. The gel was cast onto a clean glass plate, and a glass slide was used to ensure a uniform cellulose layer. The resulting film was immersed in a distilled water bath, allowing water to penetrate the DMF solvent and induce phase inversion, thereby forming a uniform porous substrate82,83.

It was stirred for 5 min at 500 rpm at 80 degrees Celsius and then stirred for 3 h at 500 rpm at 80 degrees Celsius.

Before loading, the pH of the extract was adjusted to 7 using sodium hydroxide to neutralize its inherent acidity. The Ag-MOF-TA (silver-metal-organic framework-tannic acid) scaffold was then incubated with 1 mL of the pH-adjusted extract at 37 °C for 24 h to facilitate complete loading. To confirm the successful immobilization of the extract, the residual solution was analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy (450–500 nm, corresponding to the absorption wavelength of lawsone). A significant reduction in absorption indicated quantitative binding of the extract to the scaffold84.

Each measurement was performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility85.

To evaluate the drug release rate (extracts) from the wound dressing, a pseudo-physiological medium of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was employed. A 2 × 2 cm dressing sample was immersed in 10 mL of phosphate buffer and incubated at 37 °C under gentle agitation (100 rpm) to ensure uniform diffusion. At predetermined intervals (6, 8, 12, and 24 h), 1 mL of the release medium was collected and replaced with fresh buffer to maintain sink conditions. The absorbance of the samples was measured via spectrophotometry (450–500 nm), and the extract concentration was quantified using a pre-established calibration curve. The cumulative amount of released extracts was calculated at each time point14.

Static water contact angles were measured at room temperature using a contact angle analyzer (Jikan CAG-20). A 4 µL droplet of distilled water was deposited onto the wound dressing surface, and droplet profiles were analyzed using Jikan Assistant software86. The test employed the non-settling drop method with a 5 µL droplet for static measurements. Contact angle analysis determined the material’s hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, wettability, and self-cleaning properties.

The antibacterial efficacy of the wound dressing was assessed using the disk diffusion method against two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis,Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains. Uniform dressing samples (166 mg, ~ 11 mm diameter) were tested. Bacterial suspensions were prepared in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) using the 0.5 McFarland standard (10⁶ CFU/mL, 37 °C, 18 h), adjusted to 3 × 10⁸ cells/mL via spectrophotometry. Then, 50 µL of each suspension was spread onto Nutrient Agar (Merck) plates, and dressing samples (11 mm diameter) were placed on the inoculated agar. After 24-hour incubation at 37 °C, antibacterial activity was quantified by measuring the inhibition zone diameter around each sample87.

Statistical analysis of data was performed using SAS version 9 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), graphs and tables were drawn using Excel software, and mean comparison was performed using Duncan’s test at a probability level of 5%.

The as-synthesized UiO-66 was characterized using FE-SEM, N₂ adsorption-desorption analysis, and XRD (Fig.1). The XRD pattern exhibited high crystallinity, closely matching the simulated patterns reported in the literature, confirming the successful synthesis of pure-phase UiO-6688. The diffractogram of the synthesized UiO-66 (a, blue trace) shows excellent agreement with the simulated pattern (pink trace), further verifying the material’s crystalline structure. Distinct Bragg reflections were observed at 2θ values of 7.4°, 8.5°, 12.0°, and 25.5°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (600) crystallographic planes, respectively. These reflections align with a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice symmetry. The sharp, well-defined peaks indicate high crystallinity, while the absence of extraneous peaks confirms phase purity and the lack of detectable impurities or secondary phases.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of UiO-66, derived from N₂ adsorption-desorption analysis, was determined to be 335 m²/g, consistent with a pore volume of 0.22 cm³/g. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm (b) displays a composite Type I/Type IV profile (IUPAC classification), suggesting a hierarchical pore structure with micropores and mesopores. This dual porosity enhances the material’s surface area and improves mass transport, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring high adsorption capacity.

FE-SEM imaging (Fig.1) revealed that UiO-66 consists of uniformly sized spherical particles aggregated into larger structures89. The homogeneous dispersion of these nanocomposites within the cellulose acetate matrix enhances mechanical stability and constituent compatibility, optimizing the functional integrity of the fabricated wound dressing.

In the FTIR spectroscopy of the Ag-MOF sample, the bands observed at 1400 to 1600 cm−1can be attributed to the benzene ring, and the bands at 2667 cm−1and 519 cm−1can be attributed to the Ag-O bond71. In Ag-MOF-TA (silver-metal-organic framework-tannic acid), the bands found at 1426 and 1533 cm−1were related to C = C of the aromatic ring, and the band observed at 1319 cm−1was related to the phenol group in tannic acid (Fig.2A)90.

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of tannic acid- andLawsonia inermisextract-loaded Ag-MOF silver-metal-organic framework-cellulose acetate (Ag-MOF/CA) nanocomposites reveal a broad absorption band within the 3200–3400 cm⁻¹ range, characteristic of –OH stretching vibrations originating from hydroxyl-rich constituents, including tannic acid, plant extracts, and the cellulose acetate matrix. An increase in band intensity and a discernible red shift in extract-loaded samples (LI-MA and LI-QA) indicate pronounced hydrogen bonding interactions between phenolic –OH groups and carboxylate or metal-oxo moieties (e.g., Zr–O, Ag–O) within the MOF framework. Distinct bands observed at 1600–1650 cm⁻¹ are ascribed to aromatic C = C stretching vibrations, corroborating the retention of polyphenolic and flavonoid constituents. A weak absorption band near 1700–1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C = O stretching modes, likely derived from carbonyl functionalities in tannic acid and the extract. Enhanced vibrational bands in the 1380–1450 cm⁻¹ region (C–H bending and C–O stretching) further validate the successful incorporation of bioactive extracts. Additionally, bands within the 600–700 cm⁻¹ range are attributable to metal–oxygen vibrational modes (Ag–O and Zr–O), confirming the structural preservation of the MOF architecture post-extract loading.

To investigate the crystalline and stereochemical structure of Ag-MOF, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted. The resulting pattern exhibited four prominent diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38.13°, 44.32°, 66.46°, and 77.39°, which corresponded closely with the standard silver PDF cards JCPS No. 04–0783 and JCPS No. 89–372291. These peaks can be attributed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure92. Additionally, moderate peaks at 2θ values of 40.34° and 42.59° matched the standard silver terephthalate pattern (JCPS No. 35–1679)93. The terminal effect and bridge pattern were identified as the primary coordination modes between Ag atoms and terephthalic acid (Fig.2B)71. The XRD pattern of the UIO-66 sample revealed peaks entirely consistent with the reported reference pattern, confirming the successful synthesis of a pure-phase UIO-66. FE-SEM imaging further confirmed that UIO-66 consists of uniformly aggregated spherical particles.

The morphology of the Ag-MOF-TA/CA film (silver-metal-organic framework-tannic acid-cellulose acetate film) was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). As illustrated in Fig.2C1and 2C2, silver nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 30 to 50 nm and a spherical shape were well-dispersed on the film’s surface and effectively loaded onto the Ag-MOF structures. The FE-SEM images (Fig.2C3and 2C4) further demonstrated that after loading the extract onto the wound dressing, the metal-organic silver-tannic acid framework (Ag-MOF-TA) underwent a morphological transformation from a rod-like shape to a hexagonal crystal form. This hexagonal structure was uniformly distributed across the surface of the wound dressing (Fig.2C5and 2C6).

The QuChERS method was employed with various solvents, including ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, and water, to determine the optimal solvent for enhancing extraction efficiency and preconcentration of lawsone. UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis revealed that water yielded the most intense absorption spectrum for lawsone, indicating superior extraction efficiency. In contrast, conventional soaking (maceration) extracted a broader range of plant compounds, resulting in lower lawsone specificity and efficiency compared to the QuChERS method94. Further evaluation of the absorption spectra (400–550 nm) confirmed that water provided the highest absorption intensity, corresponding to the most effective lawsone extraction. Acetonitrile produced a pale-yellow extract with a peak below 478 nm, while ethanol exhibited a robust color intensity and a peak near 478 nm. Methanol and water yielded orange-colored extracts with a higher lawsone concentration. Notably, maceration proved less selective than QuChERS, co-extracting nonspecific compounds and causing significant peak shifts. These findings align with Turchan et al., who attributed the 600–700 nm peak to chlorophyll-a (Fig.3)95. Ultimately, the QuChERS method using water achieved the highest dry extract yield (83%)96, establishing it as the optimal approach for lawsone preconcentration.

The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to measure the phenolic sources of extracts, and results were presented in mg of gallic acid. After carrying out various steps according to the method mentioned, the absorbance value of the samples was read at 720 nm concerning the control by putting the absorbance value of the samples in the equation related to the standard curve of the amount of total phenol in the extracts. The results showed that the highest amount of phenolic acid was related to the extract obtained by the maceration method. This test was consistent with the results of Kalita et al. (Fig.4A; Table6,7,8,9,and10,11,12,13)97.

The flavonoid content was quantified and expressed as milligrams of quercetin equivalent per gram of extract (mg QE/g). A stock solution of quercetin (1 mg/mL) was prepared, and absorbance measurements were taken to construct the standard curve at 415 nm following the established protocol. The sample absorbance values were then interpolated from the standard curve equation to determine the total flavonoid concentrations in the extracts. The maceration-derived extract exhibited the highest flavonoid content milligrams of quercetin per gram (1.39 mg QE/g), a finding consistent with the observations of Molazadeh et al. (Fig.4B; Table4, and 5)98. These results align with prior research in the field99further validating the methodological reliability.

The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay revealed that the maceration-based extract demonstrated the highest iron-reducing capacity (2.14 mg FeSO4 per gram of extract) (Fig.4C; Table4, and 5)99.

One of the most significant compounds in theLawsonia inermisis lawsone, which exhibits an orange-red color. The retention time of the standard lawsone solution was compared with the peaks obtained from the extracts to confirm the presence of lawsone in each extract. As illustrated in Fig.5, the standard lawsone peak appeared at four minutes. The corresponding peaks in the extracts were also eluted at the same retention time, confirming the presence of lawsone. This demonstrates that lawsone was successfully extracted using the QuEChERS and maceration methods. HPLC was employed to quantify the concentration of lawsone in the extracts. For calibration, a series of standard lawsone solutions (0.5 to 200 mg/L) were prepared in chromatographic-grade distilled water and injected into the HPLC system. The chromatograms were recorded at an absorption wavelength of 400–500 nm, and a standard calibration curve was generated. The high correlation coefficient (Table14) indicated a strong linear relationship between lawsone concentration and detector response. The peak area was measured after duplicate injections under identical conditions to determine the Lawsone concentration in the unknown samples (extracts). The results revealed that the QuEChERS method yielded a higher lawsone concentration than maceration, indicating superior extraction efficiency. Furthermore, the higher peak intensity of lawsone in the QuEChERS chromatograms, along with the reduction of interfering peaks, further validated the effectiveness of this method. In contrast, the maceration extract contained higher analytes, leading to increased interactions with the stationary phase of the HPLC column (UV-Vis detection). Consequently, the chromatograms exhibited more peaks with longer retention times, suggesting a less selective extraction process.

Historically, the QuEChERS method was primarily used for pesticide analysis, but it has since been adapted for extracting phenolic compounds. TheLawsonia inermiscontains over 70 phenolic compounds, with lawsone being one of the most significant37. This method has also been successfully applied to extract phenolics from other medicinal plants, such asPassiflora incarnata100. In this study, QuEChERS proved highly effective for isolating lawsone, with HPLC analysis confirming its higher recovery rate than maceration.

The results obtained from the absorption spectra of extractive extracts loading on the wound dressing showed that with the passage of time and the decrease in the intensity of the absorption peaks, the loading of the extract is done on the wound dressing surface. Moreover, according to the percentage change obtained from the absorption spectra, the maximum loading of the extract on the wound dressing occurred after 25 min (Table15– Fig.6A).

In the FTIR spectroscopy of the Ag-MOF-TA/CA-Film (silver-metal-organic framework- modified with tannic acid/and cellulose acetate-Film) sample, long and sharp bands observed at 1748 cm-1 can be attributed to the ester carbonyl stretch, indicating the acetyl groups. In addition, the bands from 1200 to 1300 cm−1indicated the existence of the C-O stretching band of acetate, and the 1376 cm−1band was related to the vibration of the C-H bond, indicating the acetyl groups101. In the FTIR of the extract extracted by the Maceration method, the band observed at 3375 cm−1indicated the phenol hydroxyl group, the band at 2961 cm−1indicated aliphatic C-H stretching, and the band at 1700 cm−1corresponded to carbonyl C-O stretching. In the FTIR spectrum of the extract extracted by the QuChERS method, the observed band at 1000 cm−1corresponded to the bending vibration of the C-H bond, the broadband at 3319 cm−1represented the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl phenol hydrogen bond, the small band at 2953 cm−1was related to the aliphatic and aromatic C-H group. The band at 1655 cm−1was associated with the stretching vibration of the carbonyl bond, and the band at 1400 and 1438 cm−1was related to the C = C stretching vibration of the naphthalene ring, suggesting that these characteristics corresponded to the lawsone structure (Fig.6B)96.

The formation of the Ag-MOF-TA/CA-Film wound dressing is attributed to cellulose acetate, a hydrophilic compound that facilitates effective interaction with water molecules. The Ag-MOF-TA-CA Film/LI-MA (wound dressing (silver-metal-organic framework-modified with tannic acid/and cellulose acetate-Film/containing extract prepared by maceration) exhibited a water absorption rate of 38.6%. The reduced absorption capacity in this sample may be due to the higher concentration of aromatic compounds introduced via maceration. Since these compounds are inherently hydrophobic, their increased presence diminishes the dressing’s overall water absorption. In contrast, the Ag-MOF-TA-CA Film/LI-QA wound dressing (silver- metal-organic framework-modified with tannic acid/and cellulose acetate-Film/containing extract prepared by the QuEChERS method)demonstrated enhanced water absorption (63.02%), likely due to the lower percentage of aromatic compounds and the increased hydrophilicity of cellulose acetate. Additionally, the presence of MOF-(Ag) significantly influences hydrophobicity. The carboxylic groups in Ag-MOF attract surrounding water molecules via strong hydrogen bonds, forming a dense hydration monolayer that acts as a molecular channel for water transfer, thereby improving absorption efficiency102. This controlled water absorption is particularly beneficial for high-exudate wounds, as the dressing can effectively absorb wound secretions while maintaining a moist wound environment. Furthermore, the equilibrium water fraction (79.42–93.02%, Table4, and 5) suggests that these dressings can also be applied to dry wounds to enhance hydration103. The most important advantages of the study component include:Lawsonia inermis: A widely available, cost-effective medicinal plant in Iran, making it an accessible resource for wound care applications104. Cellulose acetate: A biocompatible, biodegradable, and low-cost polymer, ideal for wound dressing substrates, particularly in electrospun nanofiber formulations, either alone or in composite materials105. QuEChERS method: An efficient, rapid, and economical extraction technique that minimizes toxic solvent use while reducing extraction time and costs106.

In this analysis, the contact angle of both samples was less than 90 °C, indicating that both samples were hydrophilic, and the wound dressing sample containing the extract prepared by the QuChERS method was more hydrophilic than the wound dressing sample containing the extract prepared by the Maceration method107. The contact angles in the wound dressings containing the extracts prepared by the QuChERS and maceration methods were 39.7 °C and 50.2 °C, respectively (Fig.7). The contact angle test was used to determine the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the wound dressing surface. If the water droplet on the surface has an angle of less than 90 degrees, it indicates that the bonding force between the water molecules is less than the bonding force between the water molecules and the new surface, confirming the hydrophilicity of the new surface108.

Contact angle measurement (θD) of wound dressings covered with extracts prepared by two different methods: (a) maceration method (θD= 50.2°), and (b) QuEChERS method (θD= 39.7°). The difference in contact angle indicates variation in surface wettability due to the extraction method.

To understand the release mechanism, a complete immersion method was performed in a phosphate-buffered saline medium for 0–24 h. The release profile was plotted in mg/L and based on the extract concentration versus time (Fig.8). It was found that after the initial rapid release, a high concentration of the extract was released into the medium, which is due to the high surface area of the Ag-MOF-TA. Gradual release occurs over time, and after 24 h, the maximum release of the extract occurs109.

Bacterial infections are known to impede wound healing and may lead to severe complications. Consequently, wound dressings with antibacterial properties are an effective strategy to prevent contamination and accelerate healing110. To evaluate antimicrobial efficacy, Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coliandPseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureusandStaphylococcus epidermidis) were tested. Studies indicate thatLawsonia inermisextract enhances collagen deposition by promoting fibrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Additionally, lawsone (a key bioactive compound inLawsonia inermis) appears to accelerate epithelialization by stimulating carbohydrate metabolism, particularly glucose utilization, thereby reducing wound gap distance and shortening the healing period111. In assessing antibacterial properties, a cellulose acetate film (control sample) exhibited no antimicrobial activity, forming no inhibition zones. Table16summarizes the bacterial growth inhibition rates of the fabricated wound dressings. Results demonstrated that the soaking extraction method achieved superior inhibition compared to the QuEChERS method. TheLawsonia inermisextract showed robust bactericidal effects against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas Gram-negative bacteria, protected by a double-membrane cell wall, displayed higher resistance, reflected in smaller inhibition zone diameters. The QuEChERS method selectively removed phenolic compounds (interfering analytes) fromLawsonia inermis, reducing antibacterial efficacy. Moreover, this method yielded fewer aromatic compounds, increasing the dressing substrate’s hydrophilicity and permitting bacterial growth around the QuEChERS-extract dressing. Notably, the incorporated tannic acid independently exerted antibacterial effects, preventing bacterial proliferation on the dressing surface despite its hydrophilic properties112. Thus, QuEChERS-based dressings remain suitable for superficial wound repair (Figs.9and10)113.Lawsonia inermisextract has antibacterial effects due to the presence of multiple compounds. These compounds have a synergistic effect. Therefore, the antibacterial properties are enhanced in the presence of all compounds. In the maceration method, since most of the compounds were extracted, especially flavonoid compounds, it can be stated that more effects were observed. On the other hand, lawsone is a naphthoquinone and has antibacterial properties, but because most of the compounds are selectively removed in the from QuEChERS method, the synergistic effect of the compounds is also reduced and bacterial inhibition is also reduced29,114,115.

Experimental research design and the relationships among experiments.

The integration of Ag-MOF with tannic acid and cellulose acetate yielded a multifunctional nanocomposite exhibiting a high surface area, hierarchical porosity, chemically active functional moieties (e.g., phenolic and hydroxyl groups), and structural stability. These properties are critical for developing advanced wound dressings with high extract-loading efficiency, controlled release kinetics, and potent antimicrobial activity. Comprehensive characterization via FTIR, XRD, and FE-SEM confirmed the successful synthesis of the nanocomposite, highlighting its potential for biomedical applications. HPLC analysis revealed that the QuEChERS method effectively extracted and preconcentrated lawsone fromLawsonia inermis, outperforming traditional maceration. Specifically, the QuEChERS method yielded a lawsone concentration of 57.63 mg/L, compared to 7.82 mg/liter via maceration, establishing its superiority for targeted extraction. Furthermore, UV spectroscopic evaluation of different solvents indicated that water, a low-risk, readily available solvent, was optimal for the QuEChERS process. Antibacterial assessments of wound dressings containing QuEChERS-extracted and maceration-derivedLawsonia inermisextracts were conducted against common wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Escherichia coli, andStaphylococcus epidermidis). The maceration-based dressing exhibited stronger antibacterial effects, withS. aureusshowing the highest susceptibility (inhibition zone: 17.5 mm). Notably, both extract-loaded dressings completely suppressed the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the pure (unloaded) wound dressing demonstrated no antibacterial activity. These findings underscore the nanocomposite’s efficacy as a drug carrier and the potential of optimized extraction methods (QuEChERS) for enhancing bioactive compound delivery in wound care applications.
