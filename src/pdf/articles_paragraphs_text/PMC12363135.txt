Gallbladder and biliary tract cancers (GBTCs) represent aggressive malignancies with poor prognosis and rising global incidence. While previous studies have examined disease burden patterns, the relationship between health workforce capacity and GBTC outcomes remains unexplored, representing a critical knowledge gap in understanding healthcare system determinants of disease management effectiveness.

We conducted a comprehensive epidemiological analysis using Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 data from 204 countries and territories (1990–2021). Age-standardized rates and absolute numbers for incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years were analyzed. Advanced statistical approaches included age-period-cohort modeling, decomposition analysis, health inequality assessment, frontier analysis, and novel correlations between 22 health workforce categories and disease burden. Bayesian age-period-cohort modeling projected trends to 2046.

Globally, incident cases increased from 107,798 to 216,768, while age-standardized incidence rates declined (EAPC: -0.45%, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.41). Males showed increasing incidence trends (EAPC: 0.22%) contrasting with declining female patterns (EAPC: -0.91%). Population growth contributed 76.7% to absolute burden increases, aging added 43.3%, while epidemiological improvements reduced burden by 19.9%. Health workforce analysis revealed paradoxical positive correlations between conventional healthcare personnel density and disease burden (physicians/community health workers:r= 0.61 for incidence,r= 0.47 for mortality), while traditional practitioners showed consistent negative correlations (r=-0.17 for incidence,r=-0.25 for mortality). Slope inequality indices increased from 2.62 to 3.45 for incidence, indicating widening absolute disparities. Projections suggest incident cases will reach 387,000 by 2046.

Despite declining age-standardized rates, absolute GBTC burden continues rising due to demographic transitions. The novel finding of paradoxical health workforce correlations challenges conventional assumptions about resource allocation effectiveness, suggesting that diagnostic capacity rather than workforce density per se determines reported disease burden. These insights inform evidence-based strategies for optimal resource allocation and targeted interventions addressing persistent global health inequalities.

Gallbladder and biliary tract cancers (GBTCs) represent a heterogeneous group of aggressive malignancies arising from the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts and the gallbladder, generally characterized by poor prognosis and rising incidence worldwide [1]. These malignancies encompass intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and ampullary carcinoma, each presenting distinct epidemiological patterns and therapeutic challenges [2–4]. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, resulting in limited treatment options and unfavorable outcomes.

The global burden of GBTCs has demonstrated complex temporal patterns over the past three decades. While absolute case numbers have nearly doubled from 107,798 incident cases in 1990 to 216,768 in 2021, age-standardized incidence rates have shown a declining trend with an estimated annual percentage change of −0.45% globally. However, this overall trend masks significant regional heterogeneity, with high socio-demographic index countries experiencing declining rates while low and low-middle SDI regions show increasing burden [5]. The disease burden varies substantially across geographical regions, with the highest rates consistently observed in the “gallbladder cancer belt” extending from South America through Asia, particularly in Chile, Republic of Korea, and Thailand.

Recent epidemiological studies have revealed striking disparities in disease patterns between sexes and across different populations. While traditionally considered more prevalent in females, recent trends suggest a shifting paradigm with males showing increasing incidence rates and females demonstrating declining patterns [6]. Risk factor profiles vary considerably across populations, with gallstone disease [7]primary sclerosing cholangitis, and chronic inflammatory conditions established as significant risk factors [8–10]. Additionally, novel associations have emerged, including the protective effect of tea consumption (hazard ratio 0.77 for gallbladder cancer) and reproductive factors such as premature menopause before age 40 being associated with increased risk [11,12].

The therapeutic landscape for advanced GBTCs has undergone significant transformation with the integration of immunotherapy. Recent landmark clinical trials have established immunotherapy-based combinations as new standards of care. The KEYNOTE-966 trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin significantly improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone, with median survival extending from 10.9 to 12.7 months [13]. Similarly, the TOPAZ-1 study showed sustained benefits with durvalumab plus chemotherapy, achieving improved survival outcomes with manageable safety profiles [14].

Healthcare system performance and resource allocation significantly impact GBTC outcomes, with substantial variations observed across countries with similar socio-demographic development levels. The increasing absolute disease burden due to population growth and aging, coupled with persistent health inequalities across socio-demographic strata, necessitates comprehensive analysis to optimize prevention and control strategies. Despite therapeutic advances, several critical knowledge gaps persist regarding the complex interplay between demographic transitions, evolving risk factor exposures, and healthcare system capabilities.

The present study addresses these knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of global GBTC burden patterns from 1990 to 2021, utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. Through advanced statistical modeling approaches, including age-period-cohort analysis, decomposition analysis, frontier analysis, and health workforce correlation analysis, we aim to elucidate the complex temporal trends, driving forces, healthcare system performance, and the critical relationship between health workforce capacity and disease management effectiveness. This novel approach of examining associations between 22 different categories of health workforce density and GBTC burden provides unprecedented insights into human resource determinants of disease outcomes, informing evidence-based strategies for optimal resource allocation, prevention, and improved patient outcomes on a global scale.

This comprehensive epidemiological analysis utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021, which provides standardized estimates of disease burden for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The GBD Study employs a systematic approach to synthesize data from multiple sources, including vital registration systems, cancer registries, population-based epidemiological studies, and administrative health records. For gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes C23, C24-C24.9), we extracted age-standardized rates (ASR) and absolute numbers for incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) stratified by sex, age groups (5-year intervals from 20 to 95 + years), and geographic location [15,16].

Four primary burden indicators were analyzed: (1) incidence, representing new cases diagnosed annually; (2) prevalence, indicating the total number of individuals living with the condition; (3) mortality, encompassing deaths attributed to gallbladder and biliary tract cancer; and (4) DALYs, combining years of life lost due to premature mortality and years lived with disability. All rates were age-standardized to the GBD world population standard to enable valid temporal and geographic comparisons. Uncertainty intervals (UI) were calculated using the 25th and 97.5th percentiles of 1,000 draw-level estimates generated through the GBD modeling process [17].

Temporal trends from 1990 to 2021 were quantified using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), calculated through log-linear regression models fitted to natural logarithm-transformed age-standardized rates. The EAPC was computed as (exp(β)−1)×100, where β represents the slope coefficient from the regression of ln(ASR) on calendar year. Confidence intervals for EAPC were derived using standard errors from the regression model. Trends were classified as increasing (EAPC > 0 with lower 95% CI > 0), decreasing (EAPC < 0 with upper 95% CI < 0), or stable (95% CI includes 0).

Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis was performed using intrinsic estimator methods to decompose temporal trends into age effects (biological aging), period effects (environmental changes affecting all age groups simultaneously), and cohort effects (exposures during specific birth periods). The analysis included individuals aged 20–99 years across 5-year age groups, 5-year calendar periods (1992–2021), and birth cohorts (1897–2001). Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each component, with statistical significance assessed atp< 0.05.

Changes in absolute disease burden from 1990 to 2021 were decomposed into three components using standardized demographic methods: (1) population growth effects, representing changes due to increased population size; (2) population aging effects, reflecting demographic transitions toward older age structures; and (3) epidemiological changes, capturing alterations in age-specific disease rates. The decomposition was calculated as: Total change = Population growth + Population aging + Epidemiological change, with percentage contributions computed for each component [18].

Socioeconomic inequalities in disease burden were quantified using two complementary measures: (1) the slope index of inequality (SII), measuring absolute differences in disease rates between highest and lowest SDI countries; and (2) the concentration index (CI), assessing relative inequalities in the distribution of disease burden across the SDI spectrum. Both indices range from negative to positive values, with values closer to zero indicating greater equality. Concentration curves were plotted to visualize inequality patterns, with statistical significance tested using bootstrap methods.

Healthcare system performance was evaluated through stochastic frontier analysis, which estimates the theoretical minimum disease burden achievable at each SDI level. The frontier represents optimal performance given available resources and development constraints. Effective differences were calculated as the gap between observed disease burden and frontier estimates, indicating potential for improvement. Countries were ranked by effective differences to identify best and worst performers relative to their development level.

Associations between health workforce density and disease burden were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients across 22 health workforce categories, including physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, traditional practitioners, and allied health professionals. Health workforce data were obtained from WHO Global Health Workforce Statistics and expressed as density per 1,000 population. Correlation analyses were stratified by time period (1990 vs. 2019) and statistical significance was evaluated atp< 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons [19].

Future disease burden projections to 2046 were generated using Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) models implemented in R software using the BAPC package. The BAPC approach represents an advanced extension of classical age-period-cohort modeling that incorporates Bayesian inference framework to account for parameter uncertainty and provide probabilistic forecasts with credible intervals. The BAPC model decomposes the logarithm of age-specific rates into additive age, period, and cohort effects: log(λ_ac) = α_a + β_p + γ_c + ε, where λ_ac represents the rate for age group a in calendar period c, α_a denotes age effects, β_p represents period effects, γ_c indicates cohort effects, and ε represents random error. To address the inherent identifiability problem in APC models, the BAPC framework employs integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) with proper prior distributions that ensure model identifiability while maintaining interpretability. Prior distributions were specified as follows: age effects followed a second-order random walk prior to capture smooth age-related changes, period effects used a first-order random walk prior to model temporal trends, and cohort effects employed a second-order random walk prior to account for generational patterns. Hyperparameters controlling the smoothness of these effects were assigned weakly informative gamma priors with shape and rate parameters selected through empirical Bayes methods. Models were fitted separately for males and females to account for sex-specific disease patterns and risk factors. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning were performed using 5-fold cross-validation with deviance information criterion (DIC) as the primary selection metric. Convergence diagnostics included trace plots, effective sample size calculations, and Gelman-Rubin statistics to ensure adequate mixing of Markov chains.

Future projections incorporated both parametric and non-parametric approaches: period effects were extrapolated using linear trends fitted to the most recent time periods, while cohort effects were projected using the established cohort patterns with appropriate uncertainty quantification. Prediction intervals were calculated using posterior distributions from Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with 10,000 iterations after 5,000 burn-in samples, providing 95% credible intervals for all projected estimates [20].

All analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Specific packages included: mgcv for generalized additive models, forecast for time series analysis, ggplot2 for visualization, and custom scripts for GBD data processing. Maps were created using the rnaturalearth and sf packages, with disease burden categories defined using natural breaks classification. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05 for all analyses, with appropriate corrections applied for multiple testing where applicable.

Globally, gallbladder and biliary tract cancer demonstrated contrasting trends in age-standardized rates versus absolute case numbers from 1990 to 2021 (Fig.1and Table S1). While age-standardized incidence rates declined from 2.89 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2.59–3.15) to 2.56 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2.16–2.89) with an EAPC of −0.45% (95% CI: −0.48 to −0.41) (Fig.1A), the absolute number of incident cases nearly doubled from 107,798 to 216,768, reflecting global population growth and aging. Similarly, prevalence showed an increasing trend with age-standardized rates rising from 3.40 per 100,000 to 3.69 per 100,000 (EAPC: 0.26%) and absolute cases increasing from 130,026 to 314,465 (Fig.1B). This divergent pattern between incidence and prevalence trends suggests improvements in survival and case detection over the study period.

Mortality patterns revealed more pronounced improvements, with age-standardized death rates declining from 2.69 per 100,000 to 2.04 per 100,000 (EAPC: −0.97%) (Fig.1D), while absolute deaths increased from 98,683 to 171,961. The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) showed the most substantial improvement in age-standardized rates, decreasing from 58.58 per 100,000 to 43.21 per 100,000 (EAPC: −1.07%), though absolute DALYs increased from 2.33 million to 3.73 million (Fig.1C). The steeper decline in mortality and DALY rates compared to incidence rates indicates modest but consistent improvements in disease management and survival outcomes globally.

Significant regional heterogeneity was observed across all burden measures, with a clear epidemiological transition pattern related to socio-demographic development. High SDI countries consistently demonstrated declining trends across all age-standardized measures (incidence EAPC: −0.77%, mortality EAPC: −1.59%, DALYs EAPC: −1.96%), while Low and Low-middle SDI countries showed increasing trends (incidence EAPC: 0.81% and 0.70%, respectively). Regionally, the highest burden in 2021 was observed in High-income Asia Pacific, Southern Latin America, and Andean Latin America, while the most significant improvements were seen in Central and Southern Latin America, Western Europe, and High-income Asia Pacific regions. Conversely, South Asia, Western Sub-Saharan Africa, and several low-development regions experienced increasing disease burden, highlighting the shift of gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden toward less developed areas.

Age-specific analysis revealed distinct temporal patterns across the lifespan, with gallbladder and biliary tract cancer demonstrating a characteristic bimodal trend in the oldest age groups (Fig.2and Table S2). For all burden measures, rates increased exponentially with age, peaking in the 80–84 years age group in 1990 and showing sustained elevation through the oldest age categories by 2021. Notably, while younger age groups (20–79 years) consistently showed declining trends across all indicators with EAPCs ranging from − 0.24% to −1.34%, the oldest age groups (85 + years) demonstrated either stable or increasing trends. The 95 + age group showed the most pronounced increases in incidence (EAPC: 1.66%), prevalence (EAPC: 1.94%), mortality (EAPC: 1.08%), and DALYs (EAPC: 1.01%), highlighting the growing burden among the very elderly population.

Sex-stratified analysis revealed significant disparities in disease patterns and temporal trends between males and females. While males showed increasing incidence trends (EAPC: 0.22%) and prevalence trends (EAPC: 1.05%), females demonstrated declining incidence (EAPC: −0.91%) and prevalence (EAPC: −0.37%) patterns. Both sexes experienced improvements in mortality and DALY rates, but the magnitude of improvement was substantially greater in females (mortality EAPC: −1.32%, DALYs EAPC: −1.40%) compared to males (mortality EAPC: −0.43%, DALYs EAPC: −0.60%). These divergent patterns suggest different underlying risk factor exposures or treatment responses between sexes, with the traditional female predominance in gallbladder cancer appearing to diminish over the study period, while outcomes improved more dramatically in women than in men.

Country-level analysis revealed profound geographic heterogeneity in gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden, with distinct regional clustering patterns maintained over the 31-year study period (Fig.3). The highest disease burden consistently concentrated in specific geographic corridors, particularly the “gallbladder cancer belt” extending from South America through Asia. In 1990, the most severely affected countries included Chile (17.50 per 100,000 incidence, 419.06 DALYs per 100,000), Republic of Korea (10.51 per 100,000 incidence, 237.21 DALYs per 100,000), and Czechia (7.59 per 100,000 incidence, 164.09 DALYs per 100,000). By 2021, while absolute rates declined in many high-burden countries, the geographic distribution pattern remained remarkably consistent, with Chile (9.01 per 100,000 incidence), Republic of Korea (8.12 per 100,000 incidence), and Thailand (7.11 per 100,000 incidence) continuing to demonstrate the highest burden levels.

Regional variations demonstrated both continuity and evolution in disease patterns across different burden measures. Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, emerged as a persistent high-burden region with incidence rates increasing from 6.37 to 7.11 per 100,000 and prevalence from 6.51 to 8.89 per 100,000 between 1990 and 2021. South American countries, led by Chile and Bolivia, maintained their position as the most severely affected globally, though with substantial improvements over time—Chile’s DALY burden decreased dramatically from 419.06 to 168.03 per 100,000. Conversely, several regions showed concerning upward trends, including parts of Sub-Saharan Africa where countries like Zimbabwe and Sao Tome and Principe demonstrated increasing burden across multiple indicators. The geographic stability of high-burden areas suggests persistent environmental, genetic, or lifestyle risk factors that transcend temporal changes in healthcare systems and socioeconomic development, while the magnitude changes reflect improvements in disease management and evolving risk factor profiles within these endemic regions.

Age-period-cohort analysis revealed distinct temporal risk patterns that illuminate the complex interplay of aging, secular trends, and generational effects in gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden (Fig.4and Table S3-5). Age effects demonstrated the expected exponential increase in relative risk across all burden measures, with the highest risks observed in the 90–94 years age group for incidence (RR: 5.57, 95% CI: 5.50–5.65), prevalence (RR: 4.34, 95% CI: 4.28–4.40), and mortality (RR: 6.50, 95% CI: 6.41–6.60), while DALYs peaked slightly earlier in the 75–79 years group (RR: 2.88, 95% CI: 2.87–2.88). Period effects revealed consistent increasing trends across successive time periods from 1992 to 1996 to 2017–2021, with the most recent period showing the highest relative risks for incidence (RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.44–1.46) and prevalence (RR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.53–1.55), suggesting improving case detection and survival over time (Fig.4A and B). Mortality and DALY period effects, while also increasing, showed more modest elevations (RR: 1.36 and 1.22, respectively), indicating genuine improvements in disease outcomes despite enhanced detection (Fig.4C and D).

Cohort effects demonstrated a pronounced generational pattern, with individuals born in earlier cohorts (1897–1916) exhibiting substantially higher relative risks across all measures compared to those born in more recent decades. The most striking cohort effect was observed in the 1897–1901 birth cohort, showing elevated risks for incidence (RR: 3.50, 95% CI: 3.24–3.78), prevalence (RR: 3.47, 95% CI: 3.14–3.83), mortality (RR: 3.68, 95% CI: 3.42–3.95), and DALYs (RR: 2.42, 95% CI: 2.36–2.48). Sex-stratified analysis revealed differential cohort patterns between males and females, with males showing more pronounced early cohort effects and steeper declines in recent birth cohorts. The consistent decline in relative risk among successive birth cohorts born after 1920 suggests substantial improvements in early-life risk factor exposures, potentially including reduced infections, improved nutrition, and better socioeconomic conditions during formative years, which collectively contributed to the observed temporal trends in disease burden across different age groups and time periods.

Decomposition analysis revealed that population growth and aging were the primary drivers of increasing absolute gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden globally, while epidemiological changes contributed to overall burden reduction through improved disease management and risk factor profiles (Fig.5and Table S6). At the global level, population growth accounted for 76.7% of the increase in incident cases, aging contributed an additional 43.3%, while epidemiological improvements offset these increases by reducing burden by 19.9%. This pattern was consistently observed across different socio-demographic index levels, with high SDI countries showing the most pronounced epidemiological improvements (−43.4% for incidence) but also experiencing substantial aging effects (76.6%), while low and low-middle SDI countries demonstrated modest epidemiological deterioration, suggesting ongoing challenges in disease prevention and management in these regions (Fig.5A). Similar patterns were observed for prevalence changes, where global population growth contributed 60.1% to increased cases, aging added 31.9%, and epidemiological factors provided a modest 8.0% improvement (Fig.5B).

Mortality and DALY burden changes demonstrated even more pronounced epidemiological improvements, highlighting genuine progress in disease outcomes despite demographic pressures. For mortality, while population growth contributed 97.6% to increased absolute deaths and aging added 56.9%, epidemiological improvements reduced mortality burden by 54.5% globally, with the most substantial improvements observed in high SDI countries (−164.8%) and significant reductions also seen in high-middle SDI regions (−90.2%) (Fig.5C). The DALY analysis revealed the most dramatic epidemiological improvements, with a global reduction of 68.9% offset by population growth (115.1%) and aging effects (53.9%). Notably, high SDI countries achieved remarkable epidemiological improvements in DALYs (−705.8%), while low and low-middle SDI countries showed positive epidemiological changes (12.4% and 13.7% respectively), indicating that even resource-limited settings have made progress in reducing disease impact per capita (Fig.5D). These findings underscore the dual challenge of managing increasing absolute disease burden due to demographic transitions while simultaneously achieving improvements in age-standardized outcomes through enhanced prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies.

Health inequality analysis revealed persistent and, in some cases, widening disparities in gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden across countries with different socioeconomic development levels between 1990 and 2021 (Fig.6and Table S7). The slope inequality index, measuring absolute inequalities, demonstrated increasing disparities for incidence (from 2.62 to 3.45, 95% CI: 2.88–4.03) and prevalence (from 3.07 to 4.84, 95% CI: 4.05–5.64), indicating that the absolute gap in disease burden between the most and least developed countries has widened over the three-decade period. Conversely, mortality and DALY burden showed more stable absolute inequalities, with slope indices remaining relatively unchanged for mortality (2.27 to 2.37) and slightly decreasing for DALYs (49.55 to 45.55), suggesting some convergence in fatal outcomes despite increasing disparities in disease occurrence. The concentration index, measuring relative inequalities, revealed a more nuanced pattern with modest reductions across all burden measures: incidence concentration index decreased from 0.53 to 0.49, prevalence from 0.59 to 0.57, mortality from 0.48 to 0.41, and DALYs from 0.42 to 0.32. This divergence between absolute and relative inequality trends suggests that while the proportional distribution of disease burden has become slightly more equitable, the absolute differences in disease rates between high and low socioeconomic countries have grown, reflecting both the overall increase in global disease burden and the varying capacity of different healthcare systems to prevent and manage gallbladder and biliary tract cancer effectively (Fig.6A-H).

Frontier analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity in country-level performance relative to their socio-demographic development, identifying significant opportunities for improvement across all burden measures in 2021 (Fig.7and Table S8). The analysis demonstrated that most countries operated below the theoretical optimal frontier, with effective differences representing the gap between observed rates and the best-achievable performance for their development level. High-burden countries consistently showed the largest effective differences, with Chile exhibiting the greatest underperformance across all indicators (incidence effective difference: 9.01 per 100,000, prevalence: 11.97 per 100,000, mortality: 7.57 per 100,000, DALYs: 168.03 per 100,000), followed by Thailand, Republic of Korea, and other endemic regions. Conversely, several countries achieved near-optimal performance for their SDI level, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where countries like Chad, Niger, and Somalia approached the frontier despite low development indices, suggesting effective resource utilization within their constraints. The analysis revealed that development level alone does not determine disease burden outcomes, as countries with similar SDI values demonstrated markedly different performance levels. For instance, among high SDI countries, significant variation existed between optimal performers approaching the frontier and underperformers with substantial effective differences, indicating that healthcare system efficiency, resource allocation, and disease-specific interventions play crucial roles beyond overall development status (Fig.7A-D).

Building upon the healthcare system performance analysis, we conducted comprehensive correlation analyses between 22 different categories of health workforce density and gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden across countries to identify key human resource determinants of disease outcomes (Fig.8). The analysis revealed consistently positive correlations between most health workforce categories and disease burden indicators, with correlation coefficients ranging from moderate to strong across all burden measures. The strongest positive correlations were observed for physicians, clinical officers, and community health workers (CHWs) combined, with correlation coefficients of 0.61 for incidence (p< 0.001), 0.69 for prevalence (p< 0.001), 0.47 for mortality (p< 0.001), and 0.43 for DALYs (p< 0.001) in 2019. Similar patterns were observed across specialized healthcare personnel including dentists, medical laboratory technicians, and pharmaceutical personnel, suggesting that higher health workforce density paradoxically correlates with increased disease burden indicators, likely reflecting better case detection, diagnostic capacity, and reporting systems in countries with more developed healthcare infrastructure.

Notably, traditional and complementary practitioners represented the only health workforce category demonstrating consistent negative correlations with disease burden across all indicators and time periods, with correlations of −0.17 for incidence (p= 0.014), −0.14 for prevalence (p= 0.048), −0.25 for mortality (p< 0.001), and − 0.27 for DALYs (p< 0.001) in 2019. This contrasting pattern became evident when examining extreme cases: countries with the highest disease burden, such as Chile (mortality: 8.26 per 100,000 with 30.04 physicians/CHWs per 1,000 vs. 1.02 traditional practitioners per 1,000 in 2019), Thailand (mortality: 6.32 per 100,000 with 7.99 physicians/CHWs per 1,000 vs. 1.33 traditional practitioners per 1,000), and Bolivia (mortality: 5.98 per 100,000 with 24.45 physicians/CHWs per 1,000 vs. 2.47 traditional practitioners per 1,000), demonstrated high conventional healthcare workforce density but relatively low traditional practitioner density. Conversely, countries with minimal disease burden, including Niger, Chad, and Gambia, exhibited the opposite pattern with very low conventional healthcare workforce density but proportionally higher traditional practitioner presence (Fig.8A and B).

Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) modeling projected continued divergent trends between absolute case numbers and age-standardized rates for gallbladder and biliary tract cancer through 2046 (Fig.9). The models predicted substantial increases in absolute burden across all indicators, with incident cases projected to nearly double from 216,750 in 2021 to 387,000 by 2046, prevalence cases increasing from 314,407 to 484,223, deaths rising from 171,942 to 286,147, and DALYs growing from 3.73 million to 5.80 million. These projections underscore the dual challenge healthcare systems will face in managing an aging global population with increasing absolute disease burden while simultaneously achieving continued improvements in prevention and treatment effectiveness, with uncertainty intervals widening substantially toward 2046, reflecting inherent uncertainties in long-term epidemiological forecasting.

Our comprehensive epidemiological analysis of gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden from 1990 to 2021 reveals complex temporal patterns that both align with and extend previous findings in the literature. The observed decline in age-standardized incidence rates (EAPC: −0.45%) coupled with a near doubling of absolute case numbers reflects the dual impact of demographic transitions and epidemiological improvements, consistent with recent global burden assessments that have documented similar paradoxical trends in cancer epidemiology.

The regional heterogeneity observed in our study, with high SDI countries experiencing declining trends while low and low-middle SDI regions show increasing burden, aligns with findings from recent studies examining global cancer inequalities. Our results corroborate the persistence of the “gallbladder cancer belt” extending from South America through Asia, with Chile, Republic of Korea, and Thailand maintaining the highest burden levels. This geographic stability suggests deeply rooted environmental, genetic, or lifestyle risk factors that transcend temporal changes in healthcare systems. A recent study by Zhou et al. specifically examining biliary tract cancer epidemiology in China reported rising trends in certain regions, particularly among males and older individuals, which is consistent with our findings of increased burden in low and middle SDI regions [21]. Similarly, international trend analyses have documented rising intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma mortality rates (APC: 3.1%) in several countries, supporting our observations of subtype-specific variations within the broader GBTC category [22].

The striking sex-specific temporal patterns revealed in our analysis represent a significant departure from traditional epidemiological understanding of GBTCs. While females have historically shown higher incidence rates, our findings demonstrate a convergence and potential reversal of this pattern, with males showing increasing incidence trends (EAPC: 0.22%) and females demonstrating declining patterns (EAPC: −0.91%). This finding is particularly noteworthy when considered alongside recent Korean cohort data demonstrating that premature menopause (before age 40) is associated with increased risk for both cholangiocarcinoma (adjusted HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01–1.64) and gallbladder cancer (adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03–1.97) [12]. The observed sex disparities in our study may reflect changing hormonal exposures, occupational risk factors, or lifestyle patterns that differentially affect males and females over time. Additionally, recent molecular characterization studies have identified sex-specific mutational patterns and treatment responses, suggesting that biological differences may contribute to the observed epidemiological trends [23].

Our age-period-cohort analysis provides crucial insights into the temporal dynamics of GBTC burden, revealing distinct generational effects that have not been previously characterized at this scale. The pronounced cohort effects observed in earlier birth cohorts (1897–1916) with relative risks exceeding 3.0 for most burden measures suggest that early-life exposures during formative years significantly influence lifetime cancer risk. These findings complement recent studies examining environmental and lifestyle risk factors, including the protective association of tea consumption (HR: 0.77 for gallbladder cancer) and potential risks associated with coffee consumption observed in large-scale pooled analyses [11]. The period effects demonstrating increasing relative risks across successive time periods (1992–2021) likely reflect improvements in diagnostic capabilities and case detection rather than genuine increases in disease occurrence, particularly given the concurrent improvements in survival outcomes.

The decomposition analysis revealing that population growth contributed 76.7% to increased incident cases while epidemiological improvements offset burden by 19.9% globally provides quantitative evidence for the competing forces shaping contemporary cancer epidemiology. These findings are consistent with recent projections suggesting that demographic transitions will continue to drive absolute burden increases despite improvements in age-standardized rates. Studies examining future burden projections have similarly identified population aging as the primary driver of increasing absolute cancer cases, with epidemiological improvements providing modest mitigation [5]. Our results extend these findings by quantifying the relative contributions across different SDI levels, revealing that high SDI countries achieve the most substantial epidemiological improvements (−43.4% for incidence) while simultaneously experiencing significant aging effects.

The health inequality assessment revealing widening absolute disparities (slope inequality index increasing from 2.62 to 3.45 for incidence) despite modest improvements in relative inequalities (concentration index decreasing from 0.53 to 0.49) highlights the complex nature of global health equity in cancer care. These findings align with broader assessments of cancer inequalities demonstrating that while proportional distributions may improve, absolute gaps between high and low development countries often persist or widen. Recent analyses of biliary tract cancer burden across European countries have similarly documented substantial disparities in access to diagnostic tools and multidisciplinary care, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions [24]. The persistence of these inequalities despite overall improvements in global health outcomes underscores the need for targeted interventions addressing both healthcare system capacity and upstream determinants of health.

Our novel analysis of health workforce correlations reveals paradoxical patterns that challenge conventional assumptions about healthcare resource allocation and disease outcomes. The consistently positive correlations between most health workforce categories and disease burden indicators, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.43 to 0.69 for physicians, clinical officers, and community health workers combined, likely reflect enhanced diagnostic capacity and reporting systems in countries with more developed healthcare infrastructure rather than causal relationships. This interpretation is supported by the observation that traditional and complementary practitioners demonstrated the only consistent negative correlations with disease burden across all indicators (correlation coefficients: −0.17 for incidence, −0.25 for mortality), suggesting either different practice patterns or populations served by these healthcare providers. These findings provide important insights for healthcare policy, indicating that simple increases in conventional healthcare workforce may not directly translate to reduced disease burden without corresponding improvements in prevention, early detection, and treatment effectiveness.

The frontier analysis identifying substantial heterogeneity in country-level performance relative to socio-demographic development provides actionable insights for healthcare system optimization. Countries like Chile, Thailand, and Republic of Korea consistently demonstrated the largest effective differences across all burden measures, indicating significant opportunities for improvement despite their relatively high development levels. Conversely, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa achieved near-optimal performance for their SDI level, suggesting effective resource utilization within existing constraints. These findings complement recent studies examining healthcare system efficiency in cancer care, which have similarly identified that development level alone does not determine disease outcomes, with healthcare system organization, resource allocation, and disease-specific interventions playing crucial roles [24].

Our predictive modeling extending to 2046 projects continued divergent trends between absolute burden and age-standardized rates, with incident cases expected to increase to 387,000 by 2046 while age-standardized rates continue declining. These projections align with recent Bayesian age-period-cohort predictions and other forecasting studies that have consistently identified demographic pressures as the primary driver of future cancer burden. The widening uncertainty intervals in our projections reflect inherent challenges in long-term epidemiological forecasting, particularly given evolving risk factor exposures, healthcare system capabilities, and potential therapeutic advances. Recent studies examining future cancer burden have emphasized the importance of strengthening prevention and early detection programs to mitigate the projected increases in absolute case numbers [5].

The clinical implications of our findings extend beyond epidemiological surveillance to inform evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies. The identification of persistent high-burden regions suggests the need for targeted interventions addressing specific environmental, genetic, or infectious risk factors. Recent therapeutic advances, including the demonstrated efficacy of pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (median OS: 12.7 vs. 10.9 months, HR: 0.83) and durvalumab-based combinations (median OS: 12.9 vs. 11.3 months) in advanced disease, provide hope for improved outcomes [13,14]. However, the persistent challenges in early detection and the limited benefit of these therapies in advanced disease underscore the critical importance of prevention and early intervention strategies.

Based on our comprehensive findings, several actionable policy recommendations emerge for addressing the global GBTC burden. First, countries within the persistent ‘gallbladder cancer belt’ should prioritize targeted prevention programs including gallstone disease prevention initiatives, hepatitis B vaccination campaigns, and region-specific dietary modification programs. Second, given our novel health workforce correlation findings, policymakers should focus on enhancing diagnostic accuracy and early detection capabilities rather than simply expanding healthcare workforce numbers, while developing integrated care models that leverage both conventional and traditional healthcare providers where negative correlations were observed. Third, addressing the widening absolute health inequalities requires differential investment strategies that provide proportionally greater resources to low and middle SDI countries, coupled with international collaborative networks for knowledge transfer and capacity building. Fourth, anticipating our projections of nearly doubled case numbers by 2046, healthcare systems must develop comprehensive capacity planning strategies that account for both demographic pressures and epidemiological improvements, including age-appropriate screening protocols, geriatric care infrastructure expansion, and specialized biliary tract cancer care networks in high-burden regions.

Several limitations of our study warrant consideration. First, the reliance on GBD estimates may introduce uncertainties related to data quality and modeling assumptions, particularly in regions with limited surveillance infrastructure. Second, the ecological nature of our health workforce correlation analysis precludes causal inferences and may be subject to confounding by unmeasured factors. Third, the heterogeneity within the GBTC category, encompassing distinct anatomical sites with different risk factors and prognoses, may mask important subtype-specific patterns. Fourth, our analysis does not account for recent molecular advances that have identified targetable alterations in approximately 34.3% of patients, including FGFR2 fusions and IDH1 mutations, which may influence future treatment paradigms and outcomes [25]. Finally, the evolving landscape of risk factor exposures, including changing dietary patterns, environmental exposures, and infectious disease prevalence, may alter future disease patterns in ways not captured by historical trends.

This comprehensive epidemiological analysis of global gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden from 1990 to 2021 reveals complex temporal patterns characterized by declining age-standardized rates concurrent with substantially increasing absolute case numbers. The observed regional heterogeneity, with high socio-demographic index countries experiencing declining trends while low and middle SDI regions show increasing burden, highlights persistent global health inequalities that require targeted interventions. The striking sex-specific temporal patterns, with males showing increasing incidence trends and females demonstrating declining patterns, represent a significant departure from traditional epidemiological understanding and warrant further investigation into underlying mechanisms.

Our age-period-cohort analysis demonstrates distinct generational effects with pronounced cohort impacts in earlier birth cohorts, suggesting that early-life exposures significantly influence lifetime cancer risk. The decomposition analysis quantifies population growth as the primary driver of increasing absolute burden, while epidemiological improvements provide modest global mitigation, with substantial variation across development levels. The health inequality assessment reveals widening absolute disparities despite improvements in relative inequalities, underscoring the complex nature of global health equity in cancer care.

The novel health workforce correlation analysis reveals paradoxical patterns that challenge conventional assumptions about healthcare resource allocation and disease outcomes, suggesting that enhanced diagnostic capacity rather than causal relationships may explain the positive correlations between healthcare workforce density and reported disease burden. The frontier analysis identifies substantial opportunities for healthcare system optimization, with significant performance variations among countries with similar development levels.

Predictive modeling projects continued divergent trends through 2046, with absolute burden expected to nearly double while age-standardized rates continue declining, emphasizing the dual challenge of managing demographic pressures while achieving epidemiological improvements. These findings inform evidence-based strategies for prevention, early detection, and optimal resource allocation, highlighting the critical importance of addressing both healthcare system capacity and upstream determinants of health to effectively reduce the global burden of gallbladder and biliary tract cancers.

The comprehensive insights provided by this analysis contribute to the understanding of global cancer epidemiology and provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions addressing the evolving challenges of gallbladder and biliary tract cancer burden in the context of demographic transitions, health system development, and persistent global inequalities.
