The impact of adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS) in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer remains unclear. The study aims to evaluate the value of OFS for patients with HR+/HER2 + early-stage breast cancer treated with trastuzumab.

Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to predict the utilization of OFS.

A total of 1,338 patients from multiple centers were enrolled, including 570 who received OFS treatment. Patients treated with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) plus OFS as adjuvant endocrine therapy showed significantly better DFS compared to those who received SERM alone (HR = 0.496; 95% CI: 0.307–0.803;p= 0.004). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis further confirmed that receiving SERM/AI plus OFS as adjuvant endocrine therapy was an independent prognostic factor in HR+/HER2 + early-stage breast cancer patients. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with estrogen-receptor (ER) expression below 50%, histological grade 3, tumors larger than 2 cm, or lymph node-positive could benefit from OFS. In addition, age<35 years, nodal involvement, histological grade 3 and ER expression below 50% were more likely to receive OFS compared with control group.

Our study confirms that premenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 + early-stage breast cancer could benefit from additional OFS after trastuzumab treatment.

The age of breast cancer diagnosis in China is generally 10 years younger than that in Western populations, with more than 60% of patients being premenopausal [1]. As is known, approximately 80% of early-stage breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtype and require adjuvant endocrine therapy [2]. In the past 20 years, tamoxifen has been the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal breast cancer [3]. Results from the phase III clinical trial (SOFT) indicated that tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) significantly improves the survival of HR-positive breast cancer compared to tamoxifen alone [4,5]. Subgroup analysis suggested that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status does not affect the benefits from OFS. The ASTRRA trial, which included younger patients (under the age of 45), similarly demonstrated that an additional two years of OFS can further reduce the recurrence risk of HR + breast cancer [6]. However, subgroup analysis from the ASTRRA trial revealed that the benefit of OFS was primarily observed in the HR-positive, HER2-negative subtype (HR+/HER2-), but not in HR+/HER2 + tumors. Moreover, few patients with the HR+/HER2 + subtype were enrolled in these two trials. Therefore, the survival benefit of OFS for HR+/HER2 + BC remains controversial.

Endocrine therapy is the most important treatment for the HR + HER2- subtype. The SOFT trial suggested that tamoxifen plus OFS improves outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone in HR + HER2- patients who are at sufficient risk to warrant adjuvant chemotherapy [4]. According to the result from Monarch E trial, patients with HR+/HER2-, node-positive early-stage BC who are at high risk of recurrence could benefit from abemaciclib [7]. Few studies focus on the endocrine therapy of the HR+/HER2 + subtype. However, due to the complex interaction between the estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 signaling pathways, HR+/HER2 + subtypes exhibit different responses to endocrine therapy [8]. An increasing body of research indicates that HR + early breast cancer patients with HER2-positive tumors benefit less from tamoxifen compared to those with HER2-negative tumors and have an increased risk of tamoxifen treatment failure [9,10]. Multiple studies have shown that anti-HER2 therapy significantly improves invasive disease-free survival rates among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [11,12]. However, only a few HR+/HER2 + patients enrolled in the SOFT trial received trastuzumab treatment. It remains unknown whether HR+/HER2 + breast cancer patients can benefit from additional OFS after trastuzumab treatment.

Regan et al. developed a composite scoring model using the nonparametrics sliding-window subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot(STEEP)methodology based on data from the SOFT and TEXT trials to help clinicians identify high-risk HR+/HER2- BC patients [13]. OFS is recommended for HR+/HER2- patients with a high recurrence score. However, there is currently no suitable approach to guide the application of OFS for HR+/HER2 + breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to report real-world treatment patterns pertaining to the choice of adjuvant endocrine therapy and evaluate the value of OFS for HR+/HER2 + breast cancer patients who have received trastuzumab treatment.

We included premenopausal women with HR+/HER2 + early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2021. Clinicopathologic features were obtained from the Shanghai Jiaotong University-Breast Cancer Database (SJTU-BCDB), which includes data from 42 breast centers in China. The study protocol received approval from the independent ethical committee of Quanzhou First Hospital, affiliated with Fujian Medical University, and adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. A waiver of informed consent was granted due to the retrospective nature of the study.

All patients received trastuzumab, administered as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg, or along with pertuzumab (recommended for patients with positive lymph nodes, loading dose of 840 mg on cycle 1 and 420 mg thereafter every three weeks). Neoadjuvant therapy was recommended for patients with tumors larger than 2 cm or with lymph node metastasis. Patients with non-pathological complete remission (non-pCR) after receiving neoadjuvant therapy are recommended to use trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens utilized in this study included: 1.EC-T regimen: Epirubicin (100 mg/m²) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) administered every three weeks for four cycles, followed by docetaxel (80 mg/m²) every three weeks for four cycles; 2. TCb regimen: Docetaxel (75 mg/m²) and carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] = 6) administered every three weeks for six cycles; 3. TC regimen: Docetaxel (75 mg/m²) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) administered every three weeks for four cycles; 4.wP regimen: paclitaxel (80 mg/m²) every weeks for 12 cycles. Chemotherapy and Anti-HER2 targeted therapy are administered simultaneously, except when combined with anthracyclines. The decision to apply OFS for treatment follows institutional guidelines based on risk stratification and tumor biological characteristics, and is determined through discussions among departmental physicians.

In this study, all patients received at least 2 years of SERM or SERM/AI combined with OFS treatment. We excluded male breast cancer patients and those with a history of breast cancer or other invasive cancers. Patients with stage 0 or IV disease were also excluded. In additon, patients lacking information on endocrine therapy and follow-up were excluded from our study. Based on our power analysis conducted prior to study initiation, we targeted enrollment of 1,300-1,350 patients to achieve adequate statistical power for detecting a clinically meaningful difference in the primary endpoint between treatment groups. This sample size calculation accounted for an anticipated 10% attrition rate and allowed for subgroup analyses of the different endocrine therapy regimens.

The primary endpoint of our study is disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from the date of receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to the occurrence of recurrence, metastasis, or death. All patients undergo outpatient follow-up visits, including every three months during the first two years after surgery, every six months during years 3–5, and annually after the fifth year. Follow-up includes medical history review, physical examination, corresponding tumor marker tests, and imaging studies. In addition, we regularly assess patients’ presenting symptoms and communicate with patients to raise their awareness about signs of recurrence.

ER or progesterone receptor (PR) positivity was defined as having at least 1% staining in tumor nuclei. ER or PR was categorized as low expression (< 50%) or high expression (≥ 50%). HER2 positivity was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a score of 3+ (IHC+++) or a score of 2+ (IHC++) confirmed by positive fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Ki-67 index was categorized as low expression (< 30%), or high expression (≥ 30%). These biomarkers evaluation was primarily based on the assessment of surgical specimens using standardized immunohistochemistry protocols. In cases where neoadjuvant therapy was administered, biomarker status was determined from the preoperative core needle biopsy specimens.

We used Chi-square tests to compare the differences in clinicopathological characteristics and treatment information between the SERM/AI(SERM or AI)+OFS group and the SERM alone group. Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were utilized for survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to predict the utilization of OFS. All analyses were perform using R version 4.2.3.pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 1,338 premenopausal women with HR+/HER2 + early-stage BC who received trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 treatment were enrolled in the study. The characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table1. 56.8%(760/1338)of patients received SERM alone as endocrine therapy. 570 patients received SERM/AI + OFS treatment, with the majority receiving AI + OFS (481/570) treatment. In the subgroup of those less than 35 years old, histologic grade 3, higher N stage (N1, N2&N3) and ER expression levels below 50%, more patients receive SERM/AI plus OFS as adjuvant endocrine treatment. In addition, 22.12% of patients received both trastuzumab and pertuzumab as anti-HER2 treatment. Among these patients, a higher proportion received SERM/AI plus OFS compared to those receiving SERM alone (36.14% vs. 11.72%).

The median follow-up time was 46 months. Patients with HR+/HER2 + breast cancer who received SERM/AI plus OFS as adjuvant endocrine therapy showed significantly better DFS compared to those receiving SERM alone (HR = 0.496; 95% CI: 0.307–0.803;p= 0.004) (Fig.1). Subgroup analysis revealed that the OFS beneficiary population was predominantly those with tumors larger than 2 cm (Fig.2A), positive lymph nodes (Fig.2B), grade 3 (Fig.2C) and ER expression less than 50% (Fig.2D). In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox regression showed that endocrine therapy, age, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), lymph node status, and ER expression level were independent prognostic factors affecting DFS in HR+/HER2 + early-stage premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab (Table2).

Age less than 35 years was the most influential factor in predicting OFS application (Odds Ratio 3.5, 95% CI 2.41, 5.09,p< 0.001) (Table3). Patients with nodal involvement were more likely to receive OFS compared with those nodal negative (Odds Ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.5, 2.49,p< 0.001) (Table3). In addition, grade 3 was also an important factor in predicting OFS application (Odds Ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.07, 1.86,p< 0.001) (Table3). In contrast to ER expression above 50%, patients with ER expression below 50% were less likely to receive OFS (p< 0.001) (Table3).

According to the St. Gallen 2021 expert consensus, 94% of experts agree that premenopausal patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who are at high enough risk to warrant chemotherapy should also receive OFS if they remain premenopausal after chemotherapy treatment [14]. However, there is no consensus regarding OFS for HR+/HER2 + BC due to insufficient evidence. In our study, we included 1,338 premenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 + early-stage BC who were treated with trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy. We found that patients receiving SERM/AI plus OFS had significantly better DFS compared to those receiving SERM alone.

In the SOFT trial, which enrolled 3,047 premenopausal women with HR + breast cancer, 367 (12%) patients had HR+/HER2 + disease. After 12 years of follow-up, the results indicated that HER2-positive tumors benefited more from the addition of OFS compared to HER2-negative tumors [5]. However, only 54% of patients with HER2 + disease in the combined SOFT and TEXT population received anti-HER2 therapy, which is now recommended for nearly all patients with HER2 + breast cancer [15]. The results of these clinical trials cannot tell us whether patients still benefit from OFS after receiving standard chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy. This study provides new evidence to address this confusion. After univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, we confirmed that receiving SERM/AI plus OFS as adjuvant endocrine therapy was an independent prognostic factor for premenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 + early-stage BC who were treated with trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 therapy. A retrospective study by Ju et al. has reported similar results [16]. However, the ASTRRA trial reported contrasting results [6]. Unlike the SOFT trial, the ASTRRA trial included a younger population with a higher risk of recurrence and administered only 2 years of OFS. This shorter duration may not effectively cover the peak period of recurrence for HR+/HER2 + BC, which could explain why patients in the ASTRRA trial did not benefit from OFS.

Furthermore, the use of OFS for HR+/HER2 + BC varies across different countries. A study from the United States founded that only 12.7% of patients with HR+/HER2 + BC received OFS [17]. Among these patients, age was the only clinicopathologic feature associated with OFS use, with those under 35 years old being more likely to receive OFS compared to those aged 35 and older. Young age is considered an independent risk factor for breast cancer prognosis [18]. The SOFT trial demonstrated that premenopausal HR + breast cancer patients under 35 years old benefit from OFS. OFS is recommended for HR+/HER2- premenopausal breast cancer patients younger than 35 years. In our study, we reported similar result. A higher proportion of younger patients (<35 years) with HR+/HER2 + BC received SERM/AI plus OFS as adjuvant endocrine therapy.

ER expression levels below 50% were identified as important prognostic factors for HR+/HER2 + breast cancer (Table2). Our findings suggest that patients with ER expression below 50% may derive greater benefit from the addition of OFS. Furthermore, tumor size larger than 2 cm, lymph node-positive, and Grade 3 tumors were also associated with the recommendation for OFS according to our results. A study by Ju et al. indicated that the benefits of OFS in patients with HR+/HER2 + breast cancer were limited to those with lymph node-positive disease [16]. This may be attributed to the small sample size of the study, which predominantly included lymph node-positive patients.

To our knowledge, this is the largest Chinese cohort to date exploring the value of OFS in HR+/HER2 + early-stage breast cancer. However, this study has several limitations. As a retrospective real-world study, it is subject to follow-up bias, selection bias, and confounding factors. Moreover, information on pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC) was unavailable, preventing us from evaluating its influence on OFS decisions or disease-free survival. Secondly, we did not investigate the optimal partner for OFS (TAM or AI) for high-risk premenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 + BC. Thirdly, due to unavailability of data regarding the specific timing of endocrine therapy and the proportion of cases with amenorrhea due to chemotherapy, we are unable to correct for this confounding factor. Finally, further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up is needed to confirm the effects of OFS for premenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 + BC.

In summary, premenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 + early-stage BC could benefit from the additional OFS after trastuzumab treatment. Age<35 years, nodal involvement, histological grade 3 or ER expression below 50% were the predictor of OFS application.
