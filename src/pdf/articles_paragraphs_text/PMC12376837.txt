The harmful effects and long-term unpredictability of conventional compounds made from lead have driven a more intense quest for practical, stable, and ecologically acceptable lead-free perovskite components. Among the exciting prospects, the pair of perovskites Rb2NaInI6stands out for its special structural, electrical, and optical properties, therefore offering a possible subsequent-generation light-absorbing substance for photovoltaic energy and optoelectronic use. We study Rb2NaInI6holistically in this work, utilizing a mixed computational method. The density functional theory (DFT) computations using WIEN2k verify their cubicFm̄3morganization with an optimal lattice consistency of 12.25 Å, guaranteeing strong structural integrity. Whereas its density of states (DOS) assessment shows substantial hybridization concerning In-5s and I-5p orbitals, boosting charge transport, the semiconductor band structure provides a secondary bandgap of 0.68 eV. Strong absorption in the visible to light spectrum, with a significant coefficient of attraction and low reflectance (<30%), makes optical analysis very appropriate for solar power plants and optoelectronic device uses. Furthermore, its dielectric material functions alongside refractive index, pointing to great possible usage in photonic devices and wavelength guides. Using SCAPS-1D, we simulate four straight heterojunction topologies, including various electron transport layers (ETLs), ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM,viaPt as the rear contact as well as CBTS as the hole transport layer, thereby exploring its device-level efficiency. Under AM 1.5G enlightenment the FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS/Pt arrangement obtained the best leads to between these with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.39 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) at 21.39 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 89.83%, particularly a staggering power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.84%. When combined with ideal ETLs, Rb2NaInI6expresses a lucky, lead-free perovskite-absorbing material that opens routes for developing stable, effective, and ecologically conscious solar panels made of perovskite. This work highlights the need to accelerate development and enhance new solar components by merging first-principles modelling with device training exercises.

The conventional crystal structure, device configuration, and band alignment of Rb2NaInI6.

Advancing innovative materials is crucial for progress in research and technology across various sectors, including energy, electronics, healthcare, and the environment. However, traditional experimental methods for discovering and optimizing materials are slow, costly, and labor-intensive—often taking over two decades to move from concept to commercialization.1This sluggish tempo engenders a bottleneck in advancement in technology, highlighting the pressing necessity for expedited and more efficient approaches to material discovery. In response to these challenges, computational materials science has emerged as a groundbreaking discipline, enabling researchers to predict material properties and design innovative molecules with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Computational technologies diminish dependence on experimentation and failure methods of testing and substantially decrease scientific and development expenditures. Research by Allisonet al.indicates that utilizing computational design can decrease time to market and yield a return on your investment of 300% to 700%.2Density Functional Theory (DFT) has emerged as one of the many potent and adaptable computing approaches. Rooted in the concept of quantum mechanics, DFT provides a first-principles framework for examining the electronic makeup of molecules, atoms, and compressed material systems.1,3–5The complicated many-body Schrödinger equation does not need to be solved directly since DFT makes it possible to calculate ground-state parameters based just on electron density. This renders it highly beneficial across several research domains, encompassing molecular morphologies,6,7elements and interfaces,8flaws in solids,9–11as well as the examination of electrical transport,12,13optical characteristics,14and contributing behavior.15The accuracy of DFT is contingent upon the exchange–correlation functional utilized, which presents difficulties in accurately simulating specific interactions; nonetheless, ongoing advancements and novel approximations have markedly improved its predictive efficacy. Consequently, DFT has become essential in contemporary materials science, connecting theoretical predictions with experimental confirmations. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines DFT with the solar panel Cell. The term capacitor Simulators (SCAPS-1D) to examine the optoelectronic characteristics and performance of the Rb2NaInI6double perovskite, a potential contender for solar power applications. We seek to deliver an extensive comprehension of the material characteristics and photovoltaic performance of this free from lead double perovskite by integrating atomistic simulations with device-level modeling.16,17After identifying viable materials, a crucial stage is the filtration and selection process. Preliminary screening often emphasizes the exclusion of materials containing hazardous substances such as lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg), as well as those that incorporate rare and costly elements like palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt).18–20Advanced Training filtering processes, based on computational projections of properties such as formation electrical power, bandgap, along with thermodynamic rigidity (e.g., hull energy), enhance the refinement of candidate materials, guaranteeing that only the best potential candidates are given preference for exploratory synthesis and testing.21–23Perovskites have transformed the domain of photovoltaics in the last decade, mostly due to their beneficial material characteristics and straightforward production. These materials generally possess a crystalline structure defined by the formula ABX3, in which ‘A’ represents a monovalent cation, ‘B’ denotes a divalent metal cation, and ‘X’ signifies a halide anion.24–26They are renowned for their ideal direct bandgaps, robust absorption of visible light, minimal effective carrier masses, and outstanding charge transport properties, including extended diffusion lengths, lifetimes, and elevated mobilities. Furthermore, their inherent defect tolerance and multifunctionality broaden their applicability beyond photovoltaics to encompass photocatalysis, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), unpredictable optical devices, photodetectors, scintillators, memristors, and field-effect transistors.27–29Since the initial demonstration of a perovskite solar cell (PSC) in 2009, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%, efficiencies have escalated to over 25.8% by 2022. Notwithstanding these notable accomplishments, the actual implementation of PSCs is impeded by two critical concerns: the environmental and health risks linked to lead-based perovskites and their inherent instability under operational settings.30,31Strategies to boost stability have involved substituting organic cations with inorganic counterparts such as Cs+and Rb+, which fortify lattice connections and improve heat and moisture stability.32–34Nonetheless, the issue of lead toxicity persists, prompting significant investigation into lead-free alternatives. Lead-free perovskites, specifically those composed of tin (Sn2+) and germanium (Ge2+), have surfaced as appealing alternatives owing to their analogous electrical structures and optoelectronic characteristics. Regrettably, these materials exhibit inadequate ambient stability, as Sn2+and Ge2+are susceptible to oxidation into their tetravalent states (Sn4+and Ge4+), leading to fast deterioration of device performance.35,36An alternate method is hetero valent replacement, in which two Pb2+ions are substituted by a mixture of monovalent (+1) and trivalent (+3) cations, resulting in lead-free double perovskites (LFDPs)viathe following formula: A2B(i)B(iii)X6.37–39These compounds provide enhanced chemical maneuverability and customization of band structure and optical characteristics, expanding the possibilities for material design. The structural paradigm of double perovskites originated in the early 20th century, with K2NaAlF6recognized as one of the initial documented instances.38–41Recent studies have concentrated on inorganic LFDPs employing Cs+or Rb+at the A-site, as these cations strengthen the contact between cations and [BX6]−octahedra, leading to improved structural integrity.34,42Sn-based perovskites have commendable photovoltaic properties, featuring band gaps ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 eV—approaching the Shockley–Queisser optimum bandgap of 1.34 eV43–45and power conversion efficiencies above 13% in certain studies.46,47Oxidation difficulties continue to exist, driving the persistent quest for innovative LFDPs that integrate stability, ideal bandgaps, and enhanced electrical characteristics. Elpasolites, a category of low-dimensional functional materials characterized by the general formula A2M(i)M(iii)X6, include more than 350 recognized structures.48,49Building upon the research of Z. Zhanget al., who achieved a power conversion efficiency of 6.37% with a hydrogenated Rb2NaInI6structure, our investigation advances this field by employing sophisticated computational methods to enhance and model device performance. We utilized an inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cell architecture, maintaining ZnO as the electron transport layer (ETL) and Cu2BaSnS4(CBTS) as the hole transport layer (HTL). Simulations were performed under AM 1.5G illumination with SCAPS-1D (version 3.8), enabling the optimization of essential parameters like absorber layer thickness, loading concentration, and defect density. Furthermore, we methodically examined the influence of HTL thickness and doping concentrations on device efficacy. To enhance comprehension of the interfacial characteristics and band alignment, we simulated devices employing four distinct electron transport layers: ZnO, WS2, WO3, and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). ZnO and WS2exhibit elevated electron mobility and advantageous energy-level alignment with perovskite absorbers, whilst WO3and PCBM provide adjustable electronic characteristics and compatibility with scalable processing methods.50–54Our simulations demonstrated remarkable maximum power conversion efficiencies of 26.84% (ZnO), 26.61% (WS2), 26.73% (WO3), and 26.26% (PCBM), underscoring the significant potential of hydrogenated Rb2NaInI6in inverted perovskite solar cell topologies. Experimental power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)
for analogous materials like Cs2AgBiBr6are modest, varying from 1.66%52to 21.88%55in optimized setups, although theoretical and computational analyses persist in highlighting their promise for high-performance solar applications.56–58DFT studies of essential electronic properties—namely band structure, bandgap, density of states (DOS), and electron density mapping—provide critical insights into the applicability of halide perovskites for optoelectronic applications.59–61Our research constitutes the inaugural comprehensive endeavor to amalgamate DFT and SCAPS-1D simulations for the assessment of the photoelectric potential of the Rb2NaInI6double perovskite. By integrating atomistic insights with device-level performance modeling, we offer a comprehensive understanding of this material's appropriateness for subsequent-generation, without lead, perovskite solar cells. This study establishes a foundation for subsequent experimental validations and informs the conceptualization of trustworthy, high-efficiency LFDP-based solar energy sources.

In this instance,ε0signifies the permittivity of free space,ψdenotes the potential of electricity, andεrindicates the proportional permittivity. The symbols ND as well as NA refer to the adjustment of charged donors as well as acceptors, whilenamongpindicate the densities of electrons plus holes. Pnalsoρpshow that the distributions of electrons and holes, respectively, andqrepresents the electric charge. Considering all processes simultaneously-recombination, generation, drift, and diffusion—the continuity equation emerges as the primary equation of importance.Eqn (2)and(3), which are continuity equations, describe the changes in the counts of electrons and holes, respectively, taking into account the various mechanisms at play.

Under this situation,JnandJpcorrespondingly reflect the current density of holes as well as electrons.RnandRpshow the relative recombination rates;GnandGpshow the hole in addition to the electron generation rates.Eqn (4)and(5)help one to determine the current densities of electrons and holes in solar cells utilizing the charged carrier drift-diffusion mathematical equations. The following formulas clarify the way holes as well as electrons migrate across the dielectric material in response to changing electromagnetic fields, concentration shifts, carrier production, and recombination events.

In this context,DnandDpdemonstrate these diffusion coefficients, whereasμnandμpcorrespondingly reflect the mobility of electrons and holes. Carrier lifetime and mobility, which are represented by the Albert Einstein relation, significantly affect their diffusion coefficient of friction. Furthermore, the absorbance constant of sheets was determined using a modified form of the old sqrt (hν−Eg) model based on the recently updatedEg-sqrt structure.Eqn (6)therefore shows this coupled with using the “Torque laws”, which offer understanding of substance absorption behavior depending upon their band gap energy.

In the provided context, the symbolshνrepresent the photon energy, andEgrepresents the band gap and absorption coefficient of the material.Eqn (7)and(8)demonstrate the relationship between the model constantsα0andβ0with the traditional model constantsAandB. This relationship allows for a clear understanding of how these parameters are interconnected and how they relate to the material's optical properties.

Fig. 1, therefore, displays our performance in the SCAPS-1D modeling. First, we created a model of our solar cell using the program. This involved organizing all the several layers, including ETLs, and that Rb2NaInI6material we employ as an electromagnetic absorber—the perovskite component. By simulating several varying situations to obtain theJ–Vcurves. We varied the voltage, light intensity (AM 1.5G), and temperature while inputting key material properties like bandgap, electron affinity, and carrier mobility. The simulation results, includingJ–Vcurves, capacitance, QE, and Mott–Schottky plots, were matched with experimental data. The software internally solves drift-diffusion, Poisson, and continuity equations to model electron behavior. Finally, we visualized and analyzed the data to assess solar cell performance.

Fig. 2aillustrates the stratified architecture of a perovskite solar cell (PSC) including Rb2NaInI6as the light-absorbing layer. The design commences with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) film at the base, functioning as a translucent conducting electrode that permits sunlight to penetrate the cell. The Electron Transportation Layer (ETL) is positioned beneath the FTO, comprised of one of four substances: ZnO,75WS2,75WO3,76or PCBM,75enabling electron transfer from the absorbers to the FTO. The absorbing layer, composed of Rb2NaInI6, captures sunlight and produces a pair of electron–holes. Furthermore, the Hole Transport Layer (HTL), consisting of CBTS,75facilitates the transfer of holes to the upper electrode. The rear contact, composed of Platinum (Pt), finalizes the cell by collecting holes and enabling their mobility, thereby generating an ongoing current flow while subjected to sunlight.

Fig. 2billustrates that the photoelectric device architecture incorporates Rb2NaInI6as the primary absorber layer, complemented by meticulously positioned holes as well as electron transport layers ETLs along with HTL to facilitate effective separation of charged particles and collection. The heterogeneous structures comprise FTO, an electron transport layer (ETL) such as ZnO, WS2, WO3, or intentionally PCBM, Rb2NaInI6, CBTS, and additionally Pt, with each layer selected to enhance energy alignment. The ETLs and Rb2NaInI6exhibit compatible band alignments, leading to the quasi-Fermi levels representing electrons (Efn) along with holes (Efp) aligning with the conduction band (EC) and valence band (EV) edges, for example, facilitating efficient electron and hole transportation to their corresponding electrodes. The HTL CBTS is deliberately designed to promote hole transport to the Pt back contact while reducing recombination losses. The resulting device architecture utilizes work function differences, employing FTO as the front contact (4.0 eV) along with Pt as the rear contact (5.7 eV), thereby inducing electron transportation toward the FTO and hole migration toward the Pt, which improves charge collection. Among the ETLs, WS2,75WO3,76or PCBM75exhibit their conduction band edges that are closely aligned with Rb2NaInI6, facilitating efficient electron transport and reducing energy loss. Although ZnO75has a lower conduction band minimum, it may create energy barriers that affect carrier dynamics. The HTL CBTS is compatible with Rb2NaInI6, facilitating efficient hole extraction. The band alignment underlies the observed solar performance, with ZnO and WO3achieving better efficiencies due to advantageous energy level alignment.Table 1outlines key parameters such as thickness, bandgap, electron affinity, dielectric constant, effective density of states (VB and CB), carrier mobilities, shallow acceptor/donor densities, and defect density (Nt). These values were carefully chosen based on fabrication data from peer-reviewed literature to ensure accurate simulation results.

In the simulations, parameters such as electron and hole thermal velocities (set at 107cm s−1) were standardized across all layers. Interface defect layers (IDLs) were introduced between the ETL/Rb2NaInI6and Rb2NaInI6/HTL interfaces to better reflect real conditions, as detailed inTable 2. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) served as the transparent, conductive anode, while platinum (Pt) was used as the cathode for its suitable work function. Simulations were conducted under standard AM 1.5G illumination at 1000 W m−2and 300 K. Only defect-related recombination was considered, excluding radiative and Auger processes. The voltage range was set from 0 to 1.8 V to capture the full operational window.

Our computational findings align well with existing literature, reinforcing the validity and robustness of the adopted methodology. Evaluating the dynamic stability of a crystalline material is essential for determining its practical applicability, particularly under time-dependent or external perturbations. To this end, the phonon dispersion curve (PDC) serves as a critical diagnostic tool. In this study, we analyzed the dynamic behavior of Rb2NaInI6by calculating its phonon spectrum along the high-symmetry paths (W–L–Γ–X–W–K) within the Brillouin zone, as depicted inFig. 4. The absence of imaginary phonon modes across the entire Brillouin zone confirms the dynamical stability of the structure. This result is significant, as imaginary frequencies would indicate structural instabilities and potential lattice distortions. Therefore, the phonon dispersion analysis provides strong evidence that Rb2NaInI6is not only energetically favorable but also dynamically stable, further supporting its potential for reliable real-world applications.

Understanding the optical properties of a material is crucial for evaluating its interaction with electromagnetic waves, which directly influences its suitability for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.88The optical properties of Rb2NaInI6are investigated over a broad range of photon energies, considering essential parameters such as absorption coefficientα(ω), optical conductivityσ(ω), reflectivityR(ω), dielectric functionε(ω), refractive indexn(ω) and energy loss functionL(ω).

The absorption coefficient is a fundamental optical parameter that quantifies how deeply incident light penetrates a material before being absorbed. A high absorption coefficient is desirable for applications such as solar cells and photodetectors.89The calculated absorption spectrum of Rb2NaInI6shows strong absorption in the visible to ultraviolet (UV) region, making it highly efficient in capturing solar energy. The initial peak in the absorption spectrum is observed at 1.70 eV, aligning with the bandgap value calculated using the TB-mBJ functional. As photon energy increases, the absorption intensity rises markedly, reaching a maximum of approximately 1.5 × 104cm−1, which signifies strong photon absorption in the ultraviolet region and highlights the material's suitability for optoelectronic applications (Fig. 7).

The optical conductivity represents the ability of free charge carriers to respond to an applied electric field within specific energy ranges.90The optical conductivity spectrum of Rb2NaInI6remains negligible at low photon energies due to its semiconducting nature. The optical conductivity (σ1) begins to rise noticeably around 6 eV, reaching a distinct peak at approximately 7.5 eV, followed by a steady decline toward near-zero values. This spectral behavior indicates a high degree of photoresponsivity in Rb2NaInI6, underscoring its potential for integration into optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors and light-emitting components.

Reflectivity is an important property that determines how much of the incident light is reflected off the surface of the material.91The reflectivity spectrum of Rb2NaInI6starts with a low value of ∼7% at 0 eV, which ensures high light absorption and minimal optical losses—a crucial requirement for solar cell applications. The reflectivity increases with energy, reaching a peak of approximately 60% around 13.6 eV, which is attributed to interbond transitions. However, the overall reflectance remains below 65%, indicating that Rb2NaInI6is an excellent absorber of light.

The dielectric function characterizes the optical response of a material when subjected to an electromagnetic field. It consists of a real partε1(ω), which represents the material's ability to store electric energy, and an imaginary partε2(ω), which corresponds to energy absorption due to electronic transitions.92The static dielectric constantε1(ω) of Rb2NaInI6is relatively high, indicating efficient charge separation, which is beneficial for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. The real partε1(ω) of the dielectric function exhibits a marked decline beyond 7 eV, suggesting the onset of metallic behavior at elevated photon energies. Meanwhile, the imaginary componentε2(ω) shows a pronounced peak near 8 eV, indicative of intense interband electronic transitions within the material.

In solar cell design, the selection of electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL) materials plays a critical role in determining the device's overall performance. These transport layers not only facilitate efficient extraction and transport of charge carriers (electrons and holes) but also significantly influence the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE). An optimal ETL/HTL combination ensures minimal recombination losses, good energy level alignment with the absorber, and high carrier mobility, all of which are essential for achieving superior device efficiency and stability. In this context,Fig. 8presents a comparative performance analysis of different ETL and HTL materials using Rb2NaInI6as the absorber layer, with a focus on four key parameters:Voc,Jsc, FF, and PCE. To select the best ETL materials, the HTL CBTS was considered, as it consistently demonstrated strong performance across various ETL combinations. Among the ETLs, ZnO stood out with the highest PCE of 26.84%, coupled with aVocof 1.39 V,Jscof 21.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 89.83%. These parameters indicate excellent charge extraction capability, minimal energy losses, and strong interfacial contact with CBTS, making ZnO an outstanding candidate. WS2also exhibited remarkable performance, achieving a PCE of 26.61%,Vocof 1.39 V,Jscof 21.42 mA cm−2, and FF of 89.03%. The layered structure and good electrical conductivity of WS likely contribute to its efficient charge transport and collection, further validating its suitability. WO3emerged as another high-performing ETL, delivering a PCE of 26.73%,Vocof 1.39 V,Jscof 21.37 mA cm−2, and FF of 88.95%. WO3's high work function and excellent electron affinity promote efficient electron extraction while suppressing recombination at the interface. Similarly, PCBM demonstrated strong performance with a PCE of 26.26%,Vocof 1.38 V,Jscof 21.34 mA cm−2, and FF of 88.92%. Although slightly lower in FF compared to the top three, PCBM still offers a robust balance of parameters and good compatibility with the CBTS HTL. The consistent performance of these ETL materials in combination with CBTS highlights their strong interfacial alignment, effective charge transport properties, and potential to enhance the overall device efficiency. In summary, the careful evaluation of performance metrics fromFig. 8justifies the selection of ZnO, WS2, WO3, and ZnS as the four best ETL materials when paired with CBTS, underscoring the importance of synergistic ETL/HTL combinations in optimizing perovskite solar cell performance.

To determine the conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO),eqn (8)and(9)can be employed. For instance, when considering WS2, the CBO at the electron transport layer (ETL)/absorber interface can be calculated using these equations.Xabsorber−XETL= 3.779–3.95 = −0.171 eV = CBO. The computed negative CBO value illustrates a cliff-like power barrier at the interface of the system. VBO is equal toXHTL−Xabsorber+ EgHTL− EgAbsorber= 3.6–3.779 + 1.9–1.702 = 0.019 eV. The absorber/HTL contact at the valence band offset. A positive CBO value indicates the existence of a spike-like energetic barrier. The VBO remained consistent at 0.019 eV across all ETLs. The CBO values varied depending on the ETL: −0.171 eV for WS2, −0.2998 eV for WO3, −1.598 eV for ZnO, and −0.298 eV for PCBM. The VBO CBO table is attached in the supporting information.

Fig. 9a–dillustrates the energy band diagrams of the simulated FTO/ETL/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS solar cells, highlighting the crucial energy level alignment at the ETL-Rb2NaInI6and Rb2NaInI6-CBTS interfaces for efficient charge extraction. For effective electron extraction, the electron affinity of the ETL must be higher than that of the Rb2NaInI6absorber, In each diagram, the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons (Fn) and holes (Fp) are shown relative to the conduction band (Ec) and valence band (Ev) energies, indicating the energy landscape for photogenerated carrier transport. The Rb2NaInI6absorber has a band gap of approximately 1.7–1.8 eV (inferred from the diagrams), while the band gaps of the ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM ETLs. The varying band alignments and offsets presented inFig. 9a–dlikely contribute to the differences inVocand FF observed for the different ETLs, underscoring the importance of selecting an ETL with optimal energy level matching to both the absorber and the front contact for enhanced charge extraction and overall device efficiency. Further analysis of the specific band offsets and their correlation with device performance metrics is necessary to identify the most promising ETL for this solar cell architecture.

The thickness of both the absorber layer and the electron transport layer (ETL) is a key determinant of solar cell performance, and overall energy conversion efficiency. Achieving optimal photovoltaic performance requires precise control over the thickness of these layers. In particular, the ETL thickness must be fine-tuned to avoid excessive light absorption and to enhance photon penetration into the absorber layer.98For high-efficiency solar cells, the entire PV structure must be carefully engineered and optimized.97Fig. 10illustrates the open-circuit voltage (Voc) variations of contour maps as a function of absorber and electron transport layer (ETL) thickness for solar cells with different ETLs: (a) FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS, (b) FTO/WS2/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS, (c) FTO/WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS, and (d) FTO/PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS. For FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 10a), theVocranges from 1.387 V to 1.405 V, with the highest values observed at a thinner absorber layer, below 0.8 μm. This suggests that reducing layer thickness enhances charge separation and minimizes recombination. A similar trend is observed for FTO/WS2/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 10b), whereVocvalues upscale from 1.386 V to 1.404 V, though the slightly narrower range compared to ZnO indicates differences in interfacial properties that could affect charge transport efficiency. In the case of FTO/WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 10c),Vocvalues range between 1.379 V and 1.397 V. A minimal absorber thickness (0.8 μm) and thinner ETL (0.05–0.06 μm) needed for achieving highestVoc, which are slightly lower than those for ZnO and WS2, possibly due to increased charge recombination or less efficient charge extraction at the interface. FTO/PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 10d) exhibits the lowestVocvalues, ranging from 1.371 V to 1.389 V, indicating that charge transport limitations or higher interfacial recombination might be negatively impacting performance. However, the ETL material selection also plays a critical role in device performance, with FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS and FTO/WS2/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS demonstrating superiorVocvalues compared to FTO/WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS and FTO/PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS. Contour maps show that an absorber thickness of 1.2–1.3 μm yields the highestJsc, highlighting the need for precise thickness optimization. Overall, selecting a suitable ETL and tuning absorber and HTL thicknesses are key to achieving high-efficiency solar cells.

Fig. 11a–dpresents contour plots illustrating the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of FTO/ETL/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS-based solar cells as a function of both absorber (Rb2NaInI6) as well as ETL thicknesses for four different ETLs: ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM. Across all cases,Jscconsistently increases with absorber thickness, particularly in the 1.2–1.3 μm range, as thicker absorbers enhance light absorption and electron–hole pair generation. For the FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 11a) structure,Jscranges from ∼20.96 to 21.75 mA cm−2, with slightly higher values observed at thinner ETLs and thicker absorbers. The FTO/WS2/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 11b) structure depicts the highest performance, achievingJscvalues from ∼21.00 to 21.76 mA cm−2, indicating that WS2gives more efficient electron extraction as well as transport. The FTO/WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 11c) configuration shows a similar trend, withJscranging between ∼20.90 and 21.73 mA cm−2, showing minimal sensitivity to ETL thickness. Meanwhile, the FTO/PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 11d) device displays a wider but slightly lowerJscrange of ∼20.64 to 21.71 mA cm−2, with the absorber thickness again playing the dominant role. The Rb2NaInI6absorber thickness is the key factor in maximizingJsc, with WS2proving to be the most effective ETL for enhancing current and overall performance. Contour maps show that an absorber thickness of 1.2–1.3 μm consistently yields the highestJsc, highlighting the need for precise optimization. Overall, selecting a suitable ETL and fine-tuning absorber and HTL thicknesses are vital for achieving high-efficiency solar cells, with WS2emerging as the most promising choose.

The contour plots inFig. 12a–dillustrate the fill factor (FF) dependency on the thickness of the ETL and absorber layer for FTO/ETL/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS solar cells. The FF, which represents the efficiency of charge extraction and recombination losses, exhibits the highest values for thinner absorber layers (0.5–0.6 μm) across all SCs, indicating improved charge transport with reduced recombination. Among the devices, WS2-based SC (Fig. 12c) demonstrates the best FF performance, peaking at 85.41%, followed by PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 12d) (85.38%), ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 12a) (85.31%), and WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS (Fig. 12c) the lowest (85.08%). ETL thicknesses between 0.05–0.07 μm are optimal, as thicker layers increase resistive losses and hinder charge transport. FF declines when absorber thickness exceeds 0.8 μm, likely due to higher recombination and reduced carrier collection. WS2emerges as the most effective ETL for high FF, with PCBM also showing competitive performance.

In perovskite solar cells, absorber defect density (Nt) refers to the density of traps or imperfections within the perovskite layer that can capture and recombine charge carriers. In contrast, shallow acceptor density (Na) refers to intentional p-type doping that adds mobile holes to facilitate the modulation of the electrical characteristics of the material that absorbs radiation. When you combine these two factors, the interaction between them strongly influences the device's key performance metrics: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).98,99The combined effect of absorber defect density and shallow acceptor density on photovoltaic (PV) performance is illustrated inFig. 14–17. In these figures, the defect density varied from 1012to 1017, while the acceptor density exhibited a similar trend.

The four 3D surface plots (Fig. 14a–d) illustrate the combined impact of shallow acceptor density (NA) and absorber defect density (Nt) on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing different electron transport layers (ETLs): ZnO-based device (Fig. 14a), WS2-based device (Fig. 14b), WO3-based device (Fig. 14c), and PCBM-based device (Fig. 14d). Across all ETLs, a clear trend emerges: as the absorber defect density (Nt) increases,Vocconsistently decreases due to enhanced non-radiative recombination, which reduces the quasi-Fermi level splitting and ultimately lowers the open-circuit potential. In contrast, increasing the shallow acceptor density (NA) generally leads to an increase inVoc, thanks to the stronger built-in electric field that improves charge separation and reduces recombination. The optimal condition for maximizingVocis a lowNt(<1013cm−3) combined with intermediate-to-highNA(1015–1016cm−3). At very highNAlevels,Vocmay plate Pt or slightly decline due to adverse effects such as increased Ptger recombination or impaired carrier mobility. Specifically, for the ZnO-based device (Fig. 14a),Vocranges from approximately 1.21 V to 1.575 V; for the WS2-based device (Fig. 14b), it spans about 1.164 V to 1.542 V; for the WO3-based device (Fig. 14c), it ranges from ∼1.190 V to 1.437 V; and for the PCBM-based device (Fig. 14d), it shows the lowest maximumVoc, between ∼1.251 V and 1.416 V. This analysis suggests that ZnO and WS2are the most favorable ETLs for achieving high open-circuit voltages, especially in scenarios of minimal number of defects and enhanced doping.

Fig. 15a–dillustrates how shallow acceptor density (NA) and absorber defect density (Nt) influence the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of PSCs across four configurations. Overall,Jscshows a strong negative dependence on absorber defect density (Nt), as higher defect densities introduce recombination centers that reduce the collection of photogenerated carriers. UnlikeVoc,Jscis less sensitive to variations in shallow acceptor density (NA), though moderate improvements are sometimes observed at intermediate to highNA, likely due to better charge extraction. However, excessively high doping levels may slightly decreaseJsc, potentially becPtse of enhanced carrier scattering or mobility limitations. For the ZnO-based device (Fig. 15a),Jscranges from approximately 19 to 20 A m−2, with similar values seen for the WS2-based device (Fig. 15b), WO3-based device (Fig. 15c), and PCBM-based device (Fig. 15d). Across all ETLs, minimizing absorber defect density emerges as the most critical factor in maximizingJsc, underscoring the importance of material quality and defect passivation strategies in high-performance PSC designs.

The combined effect of absorber defect density (Nt) and shallow acceptor density (NA) on the fill factor (FF) of perovskite photovoltaic cells, shown inFig. 16a–d, demonstrates that FF is moderately sensitive to both parameters, though less dramatically thanVoc. The analysis of the fill factor (FF) plots reveals that the ZnO-based device exhibits the highest FF values (∼90–91%) when the shallow acceptor density (NA) is in between 1016and 1017cm−3, provided the absorber defect density (Nt) remains below 1015cm−3. This indicates that the ZnO ETL can maintain excellent carrier extraction and minimize recombination even at relatively high doping levels, as long as defect densities are kept low. In contrast, WS2(Fig. 16b), WO3- (Fig. 16c), and PCBM-based (Fig. 16d) devices show initial FF values above ∼91%, which decline to ∼67–73% at the highestNtandNAregions. This decline can be attributed to enhanced recombination losses and poor charge extraction when the absorber layer has excessive defects or over-doping, both of which disrupt the optimal electric field and series resistance balance. Notably, the WS2and PCBM devices seem to retain slightly higher FF across a broader defect and doping range compared to ZnO and WO3, suggesting their better resilience against performance degradation. Overall, these plots indicate that while FF is fairly robust under low to moderate absorber imperfections, it degrades significantly when bothNtandNAexceed critical thresholds, aligning with known recombination and resistive loss mechanisms.

The 3D contour plots inFig. 17a–dshow how the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells varies with absorber shallow acceptor density as well as absorber defect density for four different electron transport layers (ETLs): ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM. Across all four cases, a clear and consistent trend emerges—as the absorber defect density increases (moving upward in the plots), the PCE decreases sharply, underscoring the critical importance of minimizing defects in the absorber layer to maintain high photovoltaic performance. For ZnO (Fig. 17a), the highest PCE (∼29–30%) is observed in a broad region where the shallow acceptor density ranges from approximately 1015to 1016cm−3under low defect densities; however, efficiency deteriorates rapidly as defects rise. WS2(Fig. 17b) exhibits the most extensive high-efficiency region (reaching ∼30–31%), again centered around a shallow acceptor density of 1015–1016cm−3, suggesting that WS2offers slightly better tolerance and potential compared to ZnO. WO3(Fig. 17c) shows a narrower optimal region, with maximum PCE (∼27–28%) shifting slightly towards higher shallow acceptor densities (around 1016cm−3), while PCBM (Fig. 17d) demonstrates the smallest high-efficiency window and the lowest maximum PCE (∼26–27%), indicating it is less effective in this material system.

The results highlight the importance of maintaining low absorber defect density to achieve high power conversion efficiency. Optimizing shallow acceptor density is also critical, with the optimal range varying slightly based on the chosen ETL. Among the materials studied, WS2emerged as the most effective ETL, followed by ZnO, while WO3and PCBM were less favorable. These insights provide valuable guidance for material selection and device design, emphasizing the strong correlation between absorber quality and ETL compatibility in enhancing perovskite solar cell efficiency.

Fig. 18presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of Rb2NaInI6and CBTS thickness variations on the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell employing different Electron Transport Layers (ETLs): ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM. The study evaluates key parameters, including Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Fill Factor (FF), Short-circuit Current Density (Jsc), and Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), providing valuable insights into absorber and buffer layer optimization for enhanced device performance. Here, the absorber thickness varied from 0.7 to 1.3 μm, while the CBTS thickness varied from 0.1 to 0.6 μm. InFig. 18a,Vocdecreases with increasing Rb2NaInI6absorber thickness, falling from approximately 1.413 V at 0.7 μm to around 1.37 V at 1.2 μm. Among the ETLs, ZnO and WS2-based devices exhibit better voltage retention, withVocstabilizing near 1.39 V, while PCBM-based cells show the lowestVoc, indicating greater recombination losses at higher thicknesses due to elongated charge transport paths alternatively,Jscsteadily improves as the absorber layer becomes thicker, increasing from about 20.8 mA cm−2to 21.6 mA cm−2across all configurations. This enhancement reflects more effective light harvesting and photocarrier generation with thicker active layers. In terms of fill factor (FF), the values remain relatively stable, fluctuating between 89.0% and 90.5% for ZnO, WS2, and WO3-based devices, which indicates minimal impact of absorber thickness on charge extraction efficiency for these ETLs. However, the PCBM-based device displays a slight FF degradation, decreasing from approximately 89.5% to 88%, likely due to increased internal resistive losses. Lastly, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) shows a noticeable enhancement as the Rb2NaInI6thickness increases from 0.7 μm to 1.2 μm, where WS2-based cells reach up to ∼27.0%. At the same time, ZnO-based configurations maintain slightly better overall efficiency, reinforcing ZnO's consistent top performance. Meanwhile, PCBM-based cells exhibit the lowest PCE, affirming their weaker overall performance. The initial increase in PCE is due to enhanced absorption of sunlight and carrier production; however, the enhancement rate diminishes at greater thicknesses, indicating a saturation threshold beyond which further width results in decreasing returns.

InFig. 18b,Vocremains nearly constant across all CBTS thicknesses (0.1 μm to 0.6 μm), with ZnO and WS2-based devices maintaining values around 1.398 V, followed by WO3at approximately 1.39 V, while PCBM-based cells continue to exhibit the lowestVocnear 1.385 V, confirming the stability of voltage across thicknesses but highlighting PCBM's relatively weaker performance due to its higher recombination tendency. In contrast,Jscconsistently improves with increasing CBTS thickness, rising from ∼21.35 mA cm−2at 0.1 μm to ∼21.45 mA cm−2at 0.6 μm for WS2, which outperforms the others, while ZnO and WO3show moderate improvements and PCBM lags slightly behind, reinforcing the significance of thicker absorbers in enhancing photocurrent through improved light absorption. Regarding FF, all devices maintain high fill factors ranging from approximately 89.8% to 90.1%, with only slight fluctuations as the CBTS thickness increases, indicating efficient charge transport and minimal resistive losses across all ETLs. Lastly, the PCE increases modestly with CBTS thickness, where ZnO-based devices show the highest performance peaking at ∼27.0%, followed by WS2(∼26.8%), WO3(∼26.6%), and PCBM (∼26.3%). This gradual improvement in efficiency stems from enhancedJscwhileVocand FF remain stable, demonstrating that optimizing CBTS thickness primarily benefits current generation without compromising charge extraction or voltage stability.

Fig. 19examines the impact of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) on the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell utilizing different ETLs (ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM). The series resistance (Rs) significantly impacts the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. In perovskite solar cells, series resistance arises from the resistance of various layers, including the ETL, HTL, absorber, and both the front and back electrodes.101InFig. 19a, asRsincreases from 1 Ω cm2to 6 Ω cm2,Vocexhibits a slight reduction, with ZnO and WS2maintaining the highest values (∼1.395 V initially, dropping by ∼0.7%), while PCBM shows the lowestVoc(∼1.385 V, decreasing by ∼0.8%).Jscremains nearly constant across allRsvalues, suggesting minimal impact on charge generation. An increase inRssignificantly reduced both FF and PCE, similar to trends in inorganic and organic solar cells.102FF declines significantly, with an approximate 6% drop for ZnO and WS2, while PCBM experiences a steeper decline (∼8%). This reduction in FF indicates that an increasingRsobstructs efficient charge extraction, raising resistive losses. Consequently, PCE follows a similar decreasing trend, with ZnO and WS2showing a total drop of ∼2%, whereas PCBM undergoes a more significant decrease (∼3%), reinforcing that excessive series resistance hinders the overall power conversion process. The reduction of FF and PCE with increasingRsis linked to the rise in power loss.59Selecting the minimumRshelps reduce its impact on PCE and FF, ultimately enhancing solar cell efficiency.

As the operating temperature increases from 300 K to 425 K, all four photovoltaic performance parameters—Voc,Jsc, FF, and PCE—undergo significant changes, influenced by the choice of electron transport layer (ETL). The impact of temperature on these SCs is shown inFig. 20a–d. This range was selected to simulate real-world operational conditions, as solar cells often experience elevated temperatures under sunlight. The observed behavior is attributed to temperature-induced changes in material properties – specifically, the reduction in bandgap and increased carrier recombination at higher temperatures, which can affect key performance metrics such asVocand FF. The mechanism is primarily related to enhanced phonon interactions, increased intrinsic carrier concentration, and possible interface degradation at elevated temperatures, which collectively influence the device efficiency. This minor improvement inJsccan be attributed to enhanced carrier mobility and reduced recombination resistance at elevated temperatures, though the gain is insufficient to offset the losses in other parameters. The fill factor (FF), which reflects the quality of charge extraction and internal resistive losses, steadily decreases for all devices as temperature rises. ZnO-based solar cells, which begin with a high FF of approximately 90%, drop significantly to around 83%, indicating increased series resistance and reduced diode ideality at higher thermal loads. WS2, WO3, and PCBM-based devices also experience FF degradation, though the decline is relatively less severe in PCBM (from ∼88% to ∼85%), implying a slightly better thermal resilience in charge transport mechanisms. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) drops across all ETLs, driven by the combined effect of reducedVocand FF. ZnO-based solar cells, which initially show the highest PCE of nearly 26% at 300 K, decline to around 22% at 425 K. Similarly, PCBM-based devices drop from ∼25.2% to ∼21%. Despite ZnO's initial superior performance, it is more susceptible to thermal degradation, especially in FF andVoc, whereas PCBM, though starting with slightly lower values, shows relatively stable thermal behavior. This highlights the importance of selecting ETL materials with better thermal stability to ensure reliable solar cell performance under varying environmental conditions.

Fig. 21provides an in-depth analysis of the electrostatic and photophysical parameters for the optimized Rb2NaInI6-based solar cells using various ETLs—ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM. The Mott–Schottky (M−S) method, based on capacitance–voltage (C–V) analysis, enables the determination of the built-in voltage (Vbi) and charge carrier density (Nd). This approach is widely utilized in standard semiconductor devices, particularly those with p–n junctions and semiconductor/metal interfaces containing space charge regions and fixed depletion layers. The junction capacitance for each unit area (C) is calculated usingeqn (12).

In this context,ε0is the vacuum permittivity,εris the dielectric constant of the donor material,qrepresents the electronic charge, and V indicates the applied voltage.77InFig. 21a, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics reveal an increasing trend with forward bias for all devices, indicating enhanced charge accumulation at higher voltages. Among the ETLs, PCBM-based devices exhibit the highest capacitance, peaking at approximately 10.8 nF cm−2at 0.8 V, while ZnO-based devices show the lowest capacitance, around 8.5 nF cm−2. This suggests a broader depletion width in ZnO, which is beneficial for efficient charge separation and suppression of interface recombination.Fig. 21bdisplays the Mott–Schottky (1/C2–V) characteristics. All devices exhibit a typical linear inverse square capacitance profile with increasing voltage. The ZnO-based cell demonstrates the steepest slope, indicating a lower carrier concentration and wider depletion region, which is aligned with its enhancedVocperformance. In contrast, PCBM presents a flatter slope, implying higher doping concentration and possibly inferior junction quality.

Fig. 21cshows the generation and recombination rates of these four PSCs. As part of the carrier production process, an electron moves from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole in the valence band and forming an electron–hole pair.59The maximum generation rates for both designs occur at approximately 1.1–1.2 mm, as depicted inFig. 21c. To calculateG(x), the electron–hole pair production, SCAPS-1D is employed along with the incoming photon flux, Nphot (l,x), as given ineqn (14).

In contrast to the generation process, recombination involves the interaction and separation of electrons and holes within the conduction band. In a solar cell, the recombination rate is influenced by factors such as the density and lifetime of the charge carriers.106A decrease in electron–hole recombination is observed due to the presence of defect states in the absorber layer. The formation of energy states within the solar cell impacts the distribution of electron–hole recombination. The recombination rate distribution becomes irregular due to the presence of defects and grain boundaries.107The ZnO-based device exhibits the highest generation rate, peaking at approximately 6.9 × 1021cm−3s−1, followed by WS2and PCBM. This superior performance of ZnO highlights its strong ability to support efficient photogeneration under optimized conditions.Fig. 21ddepicts the recombination rate across the device thickness. Here, ZnO and WS2again outperform PCBM and WO3, with ZnO-based devices showing a minimal recombination peak of approximately 2.1 × 1019cm−3s−1near the rear interface, while PCBM-based devices exhibit a significantly higher peak of about 9.5 × 1019cm−3s−1, indicating greater carrier losses. This stark contrast underscores ZnO's superior passivation capabilities and reduced defect density at interfaces. Overall, ZnO emerges as the most favorable ETL, offering the best balance of low capacitance (indicating wide depletion width), high carrier generation, and minimal recombination. These electrostatic and optical advantages explain the consistently superior device metrics (Voc,Jsc, FF, and PCE) observed in earlier figures at optimized absorber and HTL thicknesses.

Fig. 22a and bpresents theJ–Vcharacteristics and Quantum Efficiency (QE) spectra of FTO/ETL/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS-based solar cells using four different Electron Transport Layers (ETLs): ZnO, WS2, WO3, and PCBM. TheJ–Vcurves show that all configurations—FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS, FTO/WS2/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS, FTO/WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS, and FTO/PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS—exhibit similar short-circuit current densities (Jsc) in the range of approximately 21–22 mA cm−2, indicating efficient light harvesting and comparable photogenerated charge carrier collection. However, there is a clear variation in open-circuit voltage (Voc), with PCBM yielding the maximumVoc(∼1.40 V), followed up WO3(∼1.39 V), ZnO (∼1.38 V), and WS2(∼1.38 V), demonstrating that the ETL significantly influences the built-in electric field and recombination losses. The fill factor (FF) appears similar across the devices based on the curve shape, suggesting comparable series and shunt resistance characteristics. While PCE is not plotted directly, it is inferred that FTO/PCBM/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS and FTO/WO3/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS structures would exhibit higher efficiencies due to their superiorVoc. The QE spectra further reinforce these observations, showing nearly identical spectral responses across all devices with high quantum efficiencies (∼100%) in the visible range (400–700 nm) and a sharp cutoff near 720 nm, indicating the absorber's bandgap limit. These similar QE responses confirm that the absorber, Rb2NaInI6, governs the light absorption and charge generation, while the ETL predominantly impacts charge transport and extraction, particularly influencingVoc. Overall, the findings underscore that whileJscand QE remain largely unaffected by the ETL type, PCBM and WO3offer superiorVocperformance, making them the most favorable ETL candidates in this device configuration for enhanced power conversion efficiency.

Table 3compares previously reported photovoltaic device structures and the optimized configurations proposed in this work. The comparative performance evaluation of the proposed device architectures based on the Rb2NaInI6absorber layer demonstrates a remarkable advancement over previously reported structures. As shown in the table, prior studies employing various absorbers such as Cs2BiAgI6, MAPbI3, Cs2CuBiBr6, and Cs2AgBiBr6paired with different ETL/HTL combinations exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCE) ranging from 16.23% to 23.05%. Among these, the structure ITO/TiO2/CCSCNCs/Cu2O/Pt reported the highest efficiency (23.05%) with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.83 mA cm−2and a fill factor (FF) of 82.44%. In contrast, the present work introduces novel FTO-based configurations with Rb2NaInI6as the absorber and CBTS/Pt as the back contact, integrated with varying ETL materials (PCBM, WS2, WO3, and ZnO). These optimized designs achieved open-circuit voltages (Voc) up to 1.39 V,Jscvalues up to 21.39 mA cm−2, and FF exceeding 89%, resulting in an impressive peak PCE of 26.84%. Notably, the configuration FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS/Pt delivered the best performance (Voc= 1.39 V,Jsc= 21.39 mA cm−2, FF = 89.83%, PCE = 26.84%), significantly outperforming all previously reported structures. This enhancement is attributed to the superior band alignment, minimal recombination losses, and improved charge extraction at the interfaces facilitated by the optimized Rb2NaInI6absorber and ZnO ETL. Thus, this work highlights the potential of lead-free, double perovskite-based solar cells in achieving high efficiency while maintaining environmental stability and reduced toxicity, thereby paving the way for scalable and sustainable photovoltaic technologies.

In this study, a comprehensive investigation into the potential of the lead-free double perovskite Rb2NaInI6was carried out using a dual approach involving first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and one-dimensional solar cell simulationviaSCAPS-1D. The DFT analysis confirmed that Rb2NaInI6crystallizes in a stable cubicFm̄3mphase, exhibiting a moderate bandgap of 0.73 eV (viaGGA functional) and 1.70 eV (viaTB-mBj functional), which, along with strong In-5s and I-5p hybridization in the density of states, ensures favorable charge transport characteristics. The material also demonstrated high absorption coefficients in the visible to ultraviolet (UV) range-peaking around 12 eV-low reflectivity (<30%), and a high dielectric constant, all of which suggest its promise for efficient light harvesting and minimal optical loss in photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. On the simulation side, SCAPS-1D modeling complemented the theoretical predictions by revealing a wider effective indirect bandgap of 1.702 eV, optimal for solar absorption. Charge distribution analysis highlighted sodium atoms as dominant carriers, with strong covalent In–I bonds and ionic Rb–I/Na–I interactions contributing to the overall material stability. Among 36 device configurations studied using six different ETL and HTL combinations, CBTS emerged as the best-performing HTL when coupled with ZnO as the ETL. The structure FTO/ZnO/Rb2NaInI6/CBTS/Pt achieved a peak PCE of 26.84%, slightly surpassing the WO3-based counterpart. It was also observed that increasing the absorber thickness significantly enhanced performance, whereas ETL thickness had a negligible impact. The simulation further validated device robustness through Nyquist plots,J–V, and QE curves under various operating conditions, including thermal variation and defect-induced recombination. These results affirm the viability of Rb2NaInI6as a lead-free and environmentally benign material and underscore its capability to deliver high photovoltaic efficiency in tandem solar architectures. This combined theoretical–simulation approach confirms Rb2NaInI6as a strong candidate for high-efficiency, environmentally friendly, lead-free perovskite solar cells, offering a promising pathway toward sustainable and scalable photovoltaic technologies.
