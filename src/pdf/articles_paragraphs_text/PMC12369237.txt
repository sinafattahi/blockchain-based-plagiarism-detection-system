Disruption of redox homeostasis and ferroptosis have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung injury. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) are key regulators in this process. However, the clinical significance of ferroptotic factors in severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still lacking. This study investigated the prognostic value of serum glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the GSH/GSSG ratio in severe CAP.

A prospective cohort of 267 ICU-admitted severe CAP patients (2021–2023) was analyzed. Serum GPX4 and GSH/GSSG were measured within 24 h of admission. Patients were grouped by 30-day survival. Statistical analyses included comparative tests, Spearman correlation, ROC curves, Kaplan–Meier survival, and multivariate logistic regression.

Among 267 patients, 79 (29.6%) died within 90 days. Deceased patients had significantly lower GPX4 and GSH/GSSG (bothP< 0.001). GPX4 was lower in COVID-19 cases (P= 0.022), while GSH/GSSG showed no such difference. GPX4 and GSH/GSSG were moderately correlated (r= 0.301,P< 0.001). ROC analysis showed good predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality, with an AUC of 0.778 for GPX4, 0.780 for GSH/GSSG, and 0.841 for their combination. Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated lower survival with reduced GPX4 or GSH/GSSG (P< 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified lower GPX4, GSH/GSSG, COVID-19, higher SOFA scores, prolonged ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation as independent mortality risk factors.

Severe pneumonia remains a major global health challenge, ranking among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality [1]. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) alone accounts for approximately 6.5% of all annual deaths in the United States [2,3]. The disease burden is particularly high among patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [4,5]. Mortality in severe cases is commonly associated with advanced age, immunosuppression, and multi-organ dysfunction [6,7]. Despite advances in supportive care and antimicrobial therapy, the prognosis of severe CAP remains poor, highlighting the need to better understand its underlying mechanisms and identify clinically relevant indicators of disease progression.

Ferroptosis is a newly identified form of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion [8]. It plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and has been implicated in various infectious and inflammatory diseases [9]. Recent studies have begun to explore the involvement of ferroptosis in pneumonia. For example, inducing ferroptosis in Staphylococcus aureus using iron-based nanomaterials was shown to enhance bacterial clearance and improve survival in infected mice [10]. Ferroptosis has also been implicated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). In a 2020 study, ferroptosis was shown to contribute to LPS-induced damage both in bronchial epithelial cells and in murine lung tissue, with accompanying decreases in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) and Fe2+, all of which were ameliorated by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 [11]. Subsequent studies confirmed that ferroptosis exacerbates lung injury and inflammation, and that modulation of redox homeostasis, particularly GPX4 and glutathione (GSH), plays a protective role in LPS-induced injury [12]. In addition, sevoflurane was shown to alleviate LPS-induced ALI by restoring GPX4 and GSH levels and reducing ferroptosis-related damage, likely via upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [13]. Similarly, panaxydol (PX), a bioactive compound fromPanax ginseng, was found to attenuate ferroptosis and inflammation in ALI through activation of the Keap1–Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [14]. However, most existing studies focus on sepsis or LPS-induced lung injury models, and research on ferroptosis in the context of pneumonia remains limited.

Inspired by these recent findings on ferroptosis in inflammatory lung injury, we aimed to explore its clinical relevance in patients with pneumonia. GPX4 is a central regulator of ferroptosis, responsible for detoxifying lipid peroxides in an iron-dependent context [15]. Its activity is critically dependent on reduced glutathione (GSH), which serves as a necessary cofactor. The GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio reflects the intracellular redox state and is closely linked to ferroptosis sensitivity [16]. Therefore, evaluating both GPX4 and GSH/GSSG may provide complementary insights into ferroptosis-related oxidative stress in clinical settings. This study aims to investigate the clinical significance of serum GPX4 and the GSH/GSSG ratio in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). By evaluating their expression profiles and associations with clinical outcomes, we aimed to clarify the clinical relevance of GPX4 and GSH/GSSG in severe CAP and to provide translational support for their mechanistic roles in ferroptosis and redox imbalance.

This prospective observational cohort study consecutively enrolled 267 patients with severe CAP treated at our hospital from month 2021 to month 2023. All patients were diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for pneumonia, which include clinical symptoms such as cough and fever, radiological evidence of lung infiltrates, and microbiological confirmation when available [17]. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on a the quick advice guide for diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 of Chinese National Health Commission [18]. The severity of CAP was determined using the pneumonia severity index (PSI), with stages IV–V classified as severe [19]. Exclusion criteria were: (1) age under 18; (2) conditions, such as tuberculosis, lung tumors, non-infectious interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, eosinophilic pneumonia, and vasculitis; (3) immunological diseases, lung trauma, lung surgery, hematological diseases; and (4) severe infections not related to pneumonia, such as sepsis, severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, malignancies, or cardiovascular dysfunctions. All patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria or declined participation were excluded prior to enrollment, and no patients were lost to follow-up during the study. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Wuhan University of Science and Technology Affiliated Tianyou Hospital (No. TYHP-20210034). All patients participated voluntarily and signed written informed consent forms.

The sample size for this study was estimated using the formula for single proportion in cohort studies:n=Z2*P*(1−P)/d2, wherenis the required sample size,Zis the standard normal deviate at the 95% confidence level (Z= 1.96),Pis the estimated event proportion, anddrepresents the acceptable margin of error. In this study,Pwas set at 0.30 based on clinical experience indicating an approximate 30% mortality rate among patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Given the exploratory nature of this observational cohort study and the practical constraints associated with patient enrollment, the margin of errordwas set at 0.055 to ensure an appropriate balance between statistical precision and feasibility. Substituting the values into the formula yields:n= 1.962*0.30*(1–0.30)/0.0552≈267.

All severe CAP patients admitted to the ICU received standardized, evidence-based care provided by a consistent medical team in accordance with national and institutional protocols. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated promptly and adjusted based on microbiological results. Glucocorticoids were administered in patients with evidence of hyperinflammatory responses. Supportive treatments included electrolyte and acid–base management, oxygen therapy, hemodynamic stabilization with fluids and vasopressors (as needed), and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure. Nutritional support was routinely implemented.

For patients confirmed with COVID-19, antiviral agents such as remdesivir were used, in combination with adjunctive therapies, including corticosteroids and IL-6 receptor antagonists, according to national COVID-19 management guidelines [18].

Peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients within 24 h of hospital admission. Routine laboratory parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and white blood cell count (WBC), were measured using an automated biochemical analyzer (AU5800, Beckman Coulter, USA).

The serum GSH/GSSG ratio was quantified using a commercial GSH/GSSG Ratio Detection Assay Kit (Cat. No. ab138881, Abcam, UK). Serum GPX4 levels were measured with a Human GPX4/MCSP ELISA Kit (Cat. No. LS-F9592, Lifespan Biosciences, USA). All measurements using commercial kits were performed strictly in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions.

All clinical variables were collected within 24 h of hospital admission, including age, body mass index (BMI), smoking and drinking status, pre-existing comorbidities (such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus), liver and renal function indicators, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, length of ICU stay, presence of COVID-19 infection, and use of mechanical ventilation. Both APACHE II and SOFA scores were calculated according to standard criteria, and include components, such as creatinine and white blood cell count, which are also presented individually for clarity. All patients were followed for 30 days during hospitalization. For those discharged from the ICU, clinical outcomes were continuously monitored in the general ward until death or discharge. No patients were lost to follow-up.

Patients were stratified into two groups based on 30-day outcomes: the survival group (patients who recovered or were discharged) and the deceased group (patients who died due to severe pneumonia or related complications). Survival time was defined as the duration from hospital admission to death or the end of the 30-day follow-up period.

All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (range, interquartile range), and compared using the Student’sttest or Mann–WhitneyUtest, as appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive performance of GPX4 and GSH/GSSG ratio for 30-day mortality. For combined analysis, a logistic regression model incorporating both GPX4 and GSH/GSSG was constructed, and the predicted probabilities were used to generate the ROC curve. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test was performed based on median stratification [20]. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for mortality. Linearity and multicollinearity were assessed using the Box–Tidwell test and variance inflation factor (VIF), respectively. Model fit was evaluated by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and Nagelkerke’s R2. A two-sidedP< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

This prospective observational cohort included a total of 267 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the ICU, of whom 79 (29.6%) died within 90 days and 188 (70.4%) survived. As shown in Table1, the deceased group had a significantly higher median age compared to the survival group (P= 0.025). A significantly greater proportion of deceased patients were infected with COVID-19 (P< 0.001). Moreover, deceased patients had significantly higher APACHE II scores (P= 0.006), higher SOFA scores (P< 0.001), and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (P< 0.001). Besides, the PSI score was significantly higher in the deceased group compared to the survival group (P< 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use, hypertension, diabetes, liver and kidney function markers (AST, ALT, Cr, BUN), WBC counts, or ICU length of stay.

Serum GPX4 and GSH/GSSG levels were compared across different patient groups. As shown in Fig.1A, serum GPX4 levels were significantly lower in the deceased group compared to the survival group (P< 0.001), and were also reduced in patients with COVID-19 relative to those without COVID-19 (P= 0.022). As illustrated in Fig.1B, the GSH/GSSG ratio was markedly decreased in the deceased group compared to the survival group (P< 0.001), whereas no significant difference was observed between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (P= 0.779).

Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess the associations between GPX4, GSH/GSSG ratio, and various clinical parameters (Tables2and3). Serum GPX4 levels showed a significant positive correlation with AST (r= 0.129,P= 0.035) and GSH/GSSG ratio (r= 0.301,P< 0.001), while no significant correlations were observed with age, BMI, ALT, kidney function markers (Cr, BUN), WBC count, APACHE II score, SOFA score, or ICU stay duration. Similarly, the GSH/GSSG ratio was positively correlated with GPX4 (r= 0.301,P< 0.001) and ICU stay duration (r= 0.122,P= 0.047), but not with other variables.

ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of serum GPX4 and GSH/GSSG ratio for 30-day mortality in patients with severe CAP. As shown in Fig.2, GPX4 yielded an AUC of 0.778 (95% CI 0.715–0.841), while the GSH/GSSG ratio showed a comparable AUC of 0.780 (95% CI 0.714–0.845), indicating that both markers have good discriminatory ability for mortality risk. When combined using a logistic regression model, the predictive performance improved, with an AUC of 0.841 (95% CI 0.778–0.903).

To further evaluate their prognostic significance, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conducted based on the median values of GPX4 and GSH/GSSG. The median survival time was 30 (3–30, 10) days in all patients. For patients with low vs. high GPX4 levels, the median survival times were 28.5 (3–30, 19.25) and 30 (9–30, 0) days, respectively. For patients with low vs. high GSH/GSSG ratios, the median survival times were 30 (3–30, 19) and 30 (4–30, 0) days, respectively. As shown in Fig.3A, patients with lower GPX4 levels exhibited significantly reduced 30-day survival compared to those with higher levels (P< 0.01, log-rank test). A similar trend was observed for the GSH/GSSG ratio, where lower levels were associated with worse survival outcomes (P< 0.01, Fig.3B).

A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors associated with 30-day mortality in patients with severe CAP. PSI was excluded from the regression model due to its direct use in defining disease severity and its overlap with other included variables. The model demonstrated good fit as assessed by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (P= 0.955) and explained 67.0% of the variance in mortality according to Nagelkerke R2. The Box–Tidwell test confirmed the linearity of continuous variables with the logit, and no multicollinearity was observed among predictors (all VIF values < 2).

As shown in Table4, COVID-19 infection (OR = 5.696, 95% CI 2.327–13.938,P< 0.001), higher SOFA score (OR = 1.665, 95% CI 1.322–2.096,P< 0.001), longer ICU stay (OR = 1.122, 95% CI 1.025–1.229,P= 0.013), use of mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.664, 95% CI 1.107–6.406,P= 0.029), lower GPX4 levels (OR = 0.929, 95% CI 0.894–0.965,P< 0.001), and lower GSH/GSSG ratios (OR = 0.795, 95% CI 0.733–0.861,P< 0.001) were independently associated with increased mortality risk.

Severe pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and death, particularly among patients with preexisting health conditions [21]. Despite advances in supportive care, clinical evidence supporting the relevance of ferroptosis-related pathways in severe pneumonia remains limited [22]. Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has recently gained attention in various disease models, yet its clinical relevance in CAP remains underexplored. In this prospective observational study, we demonstrated that reduced serum GPX4 levels and lower GSH/GSSG ratios were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with severe CAP and served as independent predictors of 30-day mortality.

Accumulating experimental studies have suggested that ferroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia and lung injury, with GPX4 serving as a key suppressor of this process. In Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced epithelial injury, knockdown of lncRNA NEAT1 was shown to upregulate GPX4 expression and reduce ferroptosis-associated damage in alveolar epithelial cells [23]. Similarly, immunization with a mutated bacterial protein (ΔA146Ply) enhanced GPX4 levels in alveolar macrophages, suppressed ferroptosis, and improved resistance to pulmonary infections in mice [24]. In a mouse model of PM2.5-induced lung injury, treatment with Astragaloside IV increased GPX4 expression, reduced oxidative stress, and alleviated lung tissue damage [25]. In addition, moderate hypothermia was found to elevate GPX4 levels and mitigate ferroptosis in septic lung injury [26]. Despite these consistent preclinical findings, clinical evidence regarding ferroptosis and GPX4 in CAP remains limited. In this study, we found that lower serum GPX4 levels were significantly associated with worse prognosis in severe CAP patients, aligning with previous experimental results and supporting the hypothesis that GPX4-mediated inhibition of ferroptosis may contribute to improved clinical outcomes. Besides, we also observed a mild but significant positive correlation between GPX4 and AST levels, the clinical significance of which remains unclear and warrants further investigation.

Although the GSH/GSSG ratio is not a newly identified biomarker, its mechanistic connection to ferroptosis has only been recognized in recent years [27]. Traditionally, it has been used as a general indicator of oxidative stress, rather than being studied independently in the context of disease progression [28]. Several experimental studies have highlighted its protective role in pneumonia and acute lung injury. In COVID-19, reduced GSH levels have been proposed to contribute to redox imbalance and cytokine storm, with suggestions that restoring GSH may attenuate inflammation and organ damage [29]. In influenza viral pneumonia, GSH and the GSH/GSSG ratio were both elevated following emodin treatment, which reduced lung injury and viral replication by suppressing oxidative stress [30]. Similarly, in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury, Tempol treatment alleviated ferroptosis and epithelial damage by enhancing GSH synthesis, suggesting a ferroptosis-inhibitory role for GSH in pulmonary injury [31]. However, despite these preclinical insights, clinical studies directly linking GSH/GSSG levels to prognosis in community-acquired pneumonia, especially in severe cases, remain scarce. In this study, we found that a lower serum GSH/GSSG ratio was independently associated with higher mortality in patients with severe CAP. This finding is consistent with previous experimental evidence suggesting that impaired glutathione redox balance may exacerbate oxidative damage and ferroptosis, thereby contributing to worse outcomes in pulmonary diseases.

Besides, in this study, COVID-19 infection was identified as an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in severe CAP patients. Although COVID-19 is known to induce a hyperinflammatory state, often referred to as a "cytokine storm," which markedly increases the risk of multi-organ failure in susceptible individuals [32–35], the GSH/GSSG ratio did not differ significantly between patients with and without COVID-19, warranting further investigation into its role in virus-associated redox imbalance.

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center study with a moderate sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Second, only serum GPX4 and GSH/GSSG were evaluated as ferroptosis-related markers, without direct assessment of lipid peroxidation or ferroptosis-specific morphological changes. Third, although inflammatory biomarkers such as ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) have been reported to be associated with CAP prognosis, they were not included in our analysis. This was due to the limited scope of the study, which aimed to focus specifically on the prognostic relevance of GPX4 and GSH/GSSG in relation to disease severity. Fourth, the observational design precludes any causal inference between biomarker levels and clinical outcomes. Finally, although COVID-19 status was considered, viral load and variant subtype were not analyzed, which may have influenced disease severity. Future multicenter studies with expanded biomarker panels and mechanistic validation are warranted to confirm and extend these results.

In this prospective cohort study of patients with severe CAP, we demonstrated that serum GPX4 and the GSH/GSSG ratio are clinically relevant indicators of prognosis, providing translational support for their roles in ferroptosis-related lung injury. Both indicators were significantly reduced in non-survivors and independently associated with 30-day mortality, alongside established clinical parameters, such as SOFA score, mechanical ventilation, and COVID-19 status. ROC and Kaplan–Meier analyses further confirmed their predictive performance. These findings highlight the clinical relevance of ferroptosis-related oxidative stress markers in the pathophysiology and risk stratification of severe CAP. Incorporating GPX4 and GSH/GSSG measurements may provide novel insights for early prognosis evaluation and potential therapeutic targeting in pneumonia management.
