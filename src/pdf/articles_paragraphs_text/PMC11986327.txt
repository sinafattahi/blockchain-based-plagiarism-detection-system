Obesity, characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, is a significant health concern. Phytochemicals found in plants are being explored for therapeutic use, particularly in combating obesity. Among these, theobromine, commonly found in cocoa and chocolate, shows promise. Although not as extensively studied as caffeine, theobromine exhibits positive effects on human health. It improves lipid profiles, aids in asthma treatment, lowers blood pressure, regulates gut microbiota, reduces tumor formation, moderates blood glucose levels, and acts as a neuroprotective agent. Studies demonstrate its anti-obesity effects through mechanisms such as browning of white adipose tissue, activation of brown adipose tissue, anti-inflammatory properties, and reduction of oxidative stress. This study aims to suggest theobromine as a potential therapeutic agent against obesity-related complications.

Caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine are methylxanthines commonly encountered in our daily diet through the intake of cocoa, coffee, chocolate, and various teas. These constituents are widely regarded as safe for consumption.1,2Although theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) has not been studied as extensively as caffeine, it has been reported to have positive effects on human pathology.1The primary sources of theobromine are cocoa (Theobroma cacao) and cocoa-based products such as chocolate. In 50 g of chocolate, there are approximately 19 mg of caffeine and 250 mg of theobromine.3,4The beneficial outcomes of cocoa on health have been broadly studied for many years. Specifically, emphasis has been placed on its potential benefits in hypertension,5cancer,6inflammatory conditions,7regulation of intestinal microbiota,8improvement of lipoprotein profile,5,9and the treatment and prevention of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.10To our knowledge, there is no study indicating the toxicity of theobromine in humans, and in many instances, its potential positive impact on health are noted.3Theobromine plays a role in improving serum lipoprotein profile,9,11,12treating asthma and other respiratory tract diseases,3lowering blood pressure,13regulating gut microbiota,8reducing tumor formation,14regulating blood glucose levels,12,15and acting as a neuroprotective agent.16,17The anti-obesity effect of theobromine has been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies.1,18,19Possible mechanisms underlying this effect include the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT),1,18anti-inflammatory properties,9,16,17,20–23and reduction of oxidative stress.16,17,20,24Upon investigating the potential mechanisms of action of theobromine on obesity, no review addressing this topic has been found. The aim of this review is to fill the current gap in the literature regarding the effects and potential mechanisms of action of theobromine on obesity.

This review was structured as a narrative review to encompass all available research on theobromine extensively. The investigation used a comprehensive search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Scopus, accessed through the Hacettepe University Library. Keywords used to conduct the search were “theobromine” in combination with “obesity,” “browning,” “anti-inflammatory,” and “antioxidant.” Human and animal studies examining the effects of theobromine on obesity-related parameters in vivo and in vitro were included. Studies lacking primary data or presenting outcomes irrelevant to obesity were excluded. No temporal restrictions were imposed as exclusion criteria, to ensure a thorough coverage of the topic. A potential limitation of our search strategy is the reliance on English-language publications, which may have resulted in the exclusion of pertinent research published in other languages.

It is emphasized that the positive effect of cocoa on obesity may be attributed to the presence of theobromine in its composition.9Despite the established benefits of theobromine, there remain significant gaps in understanding its specific mechanisms of action in obesity management. This review aims to address these gaps. Theobromine reduces body weight gain.8,9,18,19,42In vitro (Table 1)1,18–24,42,43and in vivo (Table 2)9,12,16–19,24,42,44studies indicate that theobromine is an effective phytochemical in combating obesity, and further research in this area is warranted. Theobromine can exhibit this effect by stimulating browning, increasing lipolysis-reducing adipogenesis, and through its anti-inflammatory effects (Figure 1).1,9,16–19,21–23,42,43Overall, although in vitro and in vivo studies play crucial roles in scientific inquiry, they constitute only partial evidence. To formulate evidence-based recommendations, incorporating findings from diverse studies, such as human clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, is essential for a comprehensive understanding of intervention effectiveness and safety.

In light of all these effects, it should be noted that theobromine stimulates browning; with further studies, its mechanism of action can be better understood, potentially positioning it as an effective “browning agent” in combating obesity. Given the promising outcomes, theobromine warrants consideration for inclusion in dietary interventions targeting the promotion of browning of WAT. Nevertheless, clinical trials are imperative to validate these findings and ascertain appropriate dosages.

Although the anti-inflammatory effect of cocoa has been demonstrated,7,41,69not many studies have examined the effect of theobromine on inflammation. Gu et al20emphasized that theobromine suppresses NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β and exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through this mechanism. Theobromine has inhibitory effects on the stimulation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1.9,16,17,20,21,23,43Contrary to the findings of the aforementioned studies, Lee et al67demonstrated in their study using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells that theobromine induced inflammatory activity by stimulating NF-κB activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, resulting in the release of IL-6 and TNF-α. Camps-Bossacoma et al9observed that hepatic NF-κB and TNF-α expression was higher in the group of mice treated with theobromine.

Although numerous studies have proposed that theobromine possesses anti-inflammatory properties, others have indicated its potential for eliciting pro-inflammatory effects under specific circumstances. The inconsistency in findings may stem from variations in study design, dosage regimens, or the models used. Further research is warranted to elucidate these effects comprehensively. Although a definitive conclusion was not reached in the studies, it is observed that theobromine may have a positive effect on inflammation resulting from macrophage infiltration and the overall inflammatory condition.

Consumption of cocoa decreases oxidative stress levels.79Additionally, studies have demonstrated the antioxidant properties of theobromine.16,17,20,24,80–82Theobromine decreases ROS production induced by IL-1β and reduces levels of malondialdehyde, which indicate membrane lipid peroxidation.20Bhat et al16observed that the levels of glutathione increased in mice administered theobromine, whereas the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, indicating lipid peroxidation, decreased. Papadimitriou et al24observed a decrease in markers of oxidative stress in the kidneys when they administered theobromine to hypertensive rats for 12 weeks. Although there is a limited number of studies on this topic, it appears that theobromine could potentially be implemented in dietary recommendations to reduce oxidative stress; however, further research is needed in this area.

When the potential effects of theobromine on obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress are examined, it is evident that it could play a significant role in combating obesity. Theobromine contributes to the regulation of body weight, reduction of inflammation, and alleviation of oxidative stress through various mechanisms. Particularly by promoting WAT browning and eliciting anti-inflammatory responses, it holds potential for improving metabolic health. However, due to some inconsistencies in the current findings, a more comprehensive understanding of the exact mechanisms of action of theobromine through clinical trials is necessary. Current evidence supports the consideration of theobromine as a potential therapeutic agent in the fight against obesity and related metabolic disorders. Future research should prioritize conducting large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of theobromine as a therapeutic approach for obesity. Furthermore, exploring the synergistic effects of theobromine in conjunction with other dietary components could yield valuable insights and potentially amplify its therapeutic benefits.
