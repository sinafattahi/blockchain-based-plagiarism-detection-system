American cranberry fruit (Vaccinium macrocarponAit.) are rich in flavonols, a subgroup of flavonoids that contribute to human health and plant stress resilience. Despite their importance, the genetic diversity and potential for improvement of flavonols in cranberry remain underexplored. We analyzed phenotypic and genetic variation for eight flavonol compounds in a genetically diverse germplasm collection (n= 247) over 2 years. Myricetin‐3‐galactoside, quercetin‐3‐galactoside, quercetin‐3‐rhamnoside (Q3Rha), and quercetin‐3‐arabinofuranoside represented 87% of total flavonol content (TFC) in cranberry fruit, with TFC ranging from 0.17 to 0.75 mg/g FW (where FW is fruit weight). Wild and landrace accessions in the Rutgers cranberry collection exhibited higher genetic variation and breedability for flavonols than the breeding subgroup. We identified a stable locus on Chromosome 3 associated with Q3Rha, explaining 15.8% –19.7% of the genetic variance. Genomic prediction models for TFC exhibited predictive ability varying between 0.12 and 0.26, with combined data from both years yielding the highest values. Although further investigation is needed to improve prediction accuracy, simulated crosses showed similar outcomes between phenotypic and genomic selection. These findings elucidate the genetic architecture of flavonols and show the potential of genomic tools to enhance flavonol content and fruit quality in cranberry breeding programs.

Wild and landrace accessions are genetic diversity reservoirs for enhancing flavonol content in cranberry fruit.

A stable quercetin‐3‐rhamnoside (Q3Rha)‐linked locus explains up to 19.7% of the genetic variance; however, the favorable allele is rare.

Simulations show genomic and phenotypic selection yield similar genetic gains in cranberry flavonol content.

Berries are rich sources of essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and bioactive compounds that benefit health (Martini et al.,2023). American cranberry fruit (Vaccinium macrocarponAit.) are known for possessing an abundance of bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, which contribute to their human health benefits, including preventing metabolic syndrome, anticancer effects, and antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory abilities (Kowalska & Olejnik,2016; Pappas & Schaich,2009; Shabrova et al.,2011). Flavonoids have also been associated with plant defenses, including heat stress tolerance, UV defense, and disease resistance (Laoué et al.,2022).

Flavonols, a subgroup of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, are abundant in cranberry fruit and contribute to its unique phytochemical profile and antioxidant properties (Neto,2007). Flavonol formation involves the expression of several biosynthetic genes regulated at the transcriptional level by specific regulatory factors (Mehrtens et al.,2005; T. Wang, Yang, et al.,2020). Sun et al. (2015) performed a transcriptome analysis of cranberry fruit to identify genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, including those for flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. They found numerous candidate genes across these pathways, providing a broad overview of flavonoid‐related genes in cranberry fruit. In contrast, this study raises questions about specific genes that should be prioritized to enhance the content of flavonoids in cranberries. For example, several MYB transcription factors have been associated with the flavonol biosynthetic pathway in different plant species (Mehrtens et al.,2005; Pandey et al.,2014; N. Wang, Xu, et al.,2017). The genetic basis of flavonoid biosynthesis in cranberry has been explored for anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (Diaz‐Garcia et al.,2021,2018). Diaz‐Garcia et al. (2021) investigated a locus on Chromosome 3 associated with anthocyanin and proanthocyanin (Diaz‐Garcia et al.,2018) and identified MYB transcription factors within that genomic region. However, the genetic foundation of flavonol biosynthesis in cranberry fruit has not been thoroughly investigated. This gap underscores the need for further research to expand our understanding of flavonols in this important fruit crop.

Flavonols in cranberry fruit have been analyzed in only a few well‐known cultivars (Abeywickrama et al.,2016; Urbstaite et al.,2022; Šedbarė, Jakšāne, et al.,2023; Šedbarė, Siliņa, et al.,2022; Šedbarė, Pašakinskienė, et al.,2023; Vvedenskaya & Vorsa,2004; Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al.,2017). The genetic diversity underlying flavonol content in cranberry fruit remains largely un explored. While studies have identified differences in flavonol profiles and con tent among cultivated genotypes (Šedbarė, Jakšāne, et al.,2023; Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al.,2017), little is known about the diversity in unimproved germplasm. Harnessing these genetic resources could reveal a broader spectrum of flavonol profiles, providing valuable opportunities to enhance flavonol content and composition in cranberry breeding programs. However, developing new cranberry varieties is a lengthy and costly process, often requiring over 20 years due to long juvenile periods and the cost of establishing and maintaining beds for field evaluations. Additionally, cranberry breeding programs evaluate a small number of large biparental families (Covarrubias‐Pazaran et al.,2018). Genomic selection might offer a more efficient approach to improve cranberry by allowing early and accurate selection, decreasing the dependence on expensive and time‐consuming field evaluations, and enabling the assessment of a larger number of individuals (Consortium et al.,2021; Crossa et al.,2017; Kumar et al.,2024). The potential of genomic prediction has been explored in enhancing traits and accelerating genetic gains in various fruit and perennial crops in areas such as fruit quality (Biscarini et al.,2017; de Bem Oliveira et al.,2019; Roth et al.,2020), disease resistance (Fu et al.,2022; Jiménez et al.,2023; Yeon et al.,2024), and abiotic stress tolerance (Cappetta et al.,2021). To date, only one study has applied genomic prediction in cranberry using biparental populations to evaluate different strategies for yield and fruit weight (Covarrubias‐Pazaran et al.,2018). However, no studies have investigated genomic selection in genetically diverse cranberry collections.

In this work, we used one of the most genetically diverse collections assembled to shed light on the phenotypic diversity and genetic variation of flavonols in cranberry fruit. We seek to unravel the genetic architecture underlying flavonols in cranberry and assess the use of genomic prediction through several strategies, including its effectiveness compared to phenotypic selection. These efforts will expand our understanding of flavonol variation across cranberry germplasm and provide a foundation for developing improved varieties with higher flavonol content and superior fruit quality.

Flavonols in cranberry fruit (V. macrocarponAit.) were analyzed using a germplasm collection (TableS1) located at the Rutgers Philip E. Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research and Extension in Chatsworth, NJ (39.71543° N, 74.51046° W). This collection of 247 accessions includes 103 wild, 118 native selections, 16 cultivars, and 10 advanced breeding lines, which represent one of the most genetically diverse assemblies of cranberry genotypes in the world (Diaz‐Garcia et al.,2020; Vorsa et al.,2002). The germplasm accessions were planted in 2.25field plots in 2010, each initiated from single fingerprinted vines to maintain genetic purity. Plots were managed according to standard commercial practices for cranberry production in New Jersey, including pesticide application, fertilization, and irrigation, as previously detailed by Johnson‐Cicalese et al. (2015). In the years in which fruit samples were collected, 2016 and 2017, the winter flood was removed in late April; a preemergent herbicide, napropamide (Devrinol), was applied in early May; fungicides were used at 10‐day intervals starting mid‐bloom, prothioconazole/asoxystrobin (Proline/Abound) applied twice, followed by chlorothalonil (Bravo) two to three times to control fruit rot; and an insecticide (Carbaryl) was applied in late July, following bloom, for leafhopper control. Fertilizer was applied monthly from mid‐May through early August, resulting in approximately 27 kg of nitrogen for the year. Plots were irrigated as needed throughout the season.

We collected approximately 50 ripe cranberry fruits per accession in late September 2016 and 2017—the typical commercial harvest period in New Jersey, guided by fruit color (anthocyanin content) and maturity (Averill et al.,2008)—and stored them at 20C until subsequent analyses of fruit quality traits. The flavonol extraction method was adapted from (Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al.2017) using a subsample of three berries (5 g), which were ground in a Precellys Evolution homogenizer at 7200 rpm for 1 min. The homogenized samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1 min, and then 20 mL of 80% acetone with 0.1% acetic acid was added to resuspend the ground material. The mixture was stored at 4C for over 24 h, after which a 1 mL aliquot was extracted and dried using a vacuum dryer for 12 h. The dried sample was resuspended in 500 µL of methanol and sonicated for 15 min before running on high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cranberry flavonols were analyzed in a Dionex UltiMate 3000 LC system (Dionex Corporation) with a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (150 mm×4.6 mm, 110 Å, 5 µm) at 1 mL/min with a linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Detection was performed at 366 nm following the solvent conditions and gradient times described by Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al. (2017). Standards were available only for quercetin‐3‐galactoside (Q3Gal), quercetin‐3‐glucoside (Q3Glc), and quercetin‐3‐rhamnoside (Q3Rha). Myricetin‐3‐galactoside (My3Gal), myricetin‐3‐arabinoside (My3Ara), quercetin‐3‐xylopyranoside (Q3Xyl), quercetin‐3‐arabinopyranoside (Q3Arap), and quercetin‐3‐arabinofuranoside (Q3Araf) were estimated using the Q3Gal standard curve. The total flavonol content (TFC) was determined by summing the concentrations of all individual flavonols analyzed in this study. Concentrations were reported in milligrams per gram of fruit weight (mg/g FW).

Young leaf tissue was collected and dried with a Labconco Freezezone lyophilizer. The samples were processed (DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing) with the 17K cranberry Flex‐Seq platform (Rapid Genomics) (Clare et al.2024; TableS1). The raw sequencing data were trimmed with Cutadapt 2.6 (Martin,2011) to remove adapter contamination and low‐quality bases (‐q 20 ‐m 30). Quality‐trimmed reads were aligned with the Ben Lear v1.0 reference genome (https://www.vaccinium.org/; Kawash et al.2022) using the BWA 0.7.17 aligner tool (Li,2013). We utilized the GATK4 workflow (Poplin et al.,2017) to identify an initial set of 622,963 bi‐allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To ensure high‐quality variant calls, we applied filtering criteria using BCFtools 1.20 (Li,2011), retaining SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF)≥0.05 and missing data≤10%. The resulting set of 24,154 SNPs was then converted into numeric format (1, 0, and 1) for downstream analyses (DataS1).

The narrow‐sense genomic heritability (h^g2) was estimated using an LMM incorporating a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) calculated from 24,154 SNP marker genotypes using theA.matfunction from the R packagesommer(Covarrubias‐Pazaran,2016). The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was employed to estimate the variance components (Bates et al.,2015).h^g2was calculated asσ^A2/σ^P2, whereσ^A2represents the REML estimate of the genomic additive genetic variance among genotypes (Endelman,2011; Mathew et al.,2018) andσ^P2is the phenotypic variance.σ^P2was estimated asσ^G2+σ^e2/r, whereris the number of observations per individual (r=2across years). The coefficient of additive genetic variance was estimated byCVA=100×σ^A/μ^, whereμ^is population mean.

Phenotypic and additive genetic correlations among flavonols were estimated using a multivariate LMM in the R packagesommer(Covarrubias‐Pazaran,2016). The analysis included EMMs across years and a GRM calculated above. Additive genetic correlations were obtained by standardizing the additive genetic variance–covariance matrix, where each genetic covariance was divided by the product of the standard deviations of the corresponding traits. Phenotypic correlations were derived similarly, using the sum of the additive genetic and residual variance–covariance matrices.

A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SNP data to evaluate population structure in the germplasm collection with theprcomp()function in R. Flavonol EMMs and SNP data were integrated to investigate population structure and relationships of flavonol compounds in the cranberry germplasm collection. Gower distance was calculated using the R packagecluster(Maechler et al.,2023) to perform hierarchical clustering with thehclustfunction in R. The optimal number of clusters was determined by clusteringk‐means using thekmeansfunction in R. The cluster quality was assessed by calculating the sum of squares within the cluster for cluster numbers ranging from 2 to 10 and plotting the results against the cluster numbers (K). The “elbow point” method was applied to determine the optimal number of clusters.

The genetic basis of TFC and individual flavonols was investigated using raw phenotypic data for single‐year analyses and EMMs for across‐year analyses through GEMMA 0.98.3 (Zhou & Stephens,2012,2014). This analysis was carried out using 5099 SNPs from the filtered set of 24,154 markers due to GEMMA's default quality control filters. The final SNP set used in the association analysis had an average MAF of 0.31 (0.05–0.50) with no missing data. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium, measured asr2, averaged 0.35 and decayed below 0.30 by approximately 15 kb (FigureS1). The GRM was incorporated into genome‐wide association analyses to account for genetic relationships among genotypes (Zhou & Stephens,2012,2014). A significance threshold with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to test the null hypothesis that SNPs are not associated with the trait (Benjamini & Hochberg,1995). The most significant SNPs from single‐year and across‐year analyses were fitted into multilocus genetic models to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained (PVE=σ^M2/σ^P2) and genetic variance explained (GVE=σ^M2/σ^G2) by each locus, whereσ^M2is a REML estimate of the average semivariance corrected for bias of the PVE and GVE by the SNP marker (Feldmann et al.,2021),σ^G2is the genetic variance between genotypes andσ^P2is the phenotypic variance;σ^G2was decomposed into the contribution of SNP marker loci and the residual genetic variance not captured by these loci. The additive and dominance effects of the most significant SNP associated with Q3Rha on Chromosome 3 (Vmac_chr03:20409239) were calculated usingα^=μ^AA−μ^GGandδ^=(μ^GA−μ^AA+μ^GG)/2, respectively. Here,μ^GG,μ^GA, andμ^AArepresent the EMMs for accessions with the GG, GA, and AA genotypes at the Vmac_chr03:20409239 SNP locus. The degree of dominance at this locus was quantified as|δ^/α^|(Falconer & Mackay,1996; Walsh,2001).

Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for TFC were estimated using genomic‐best linear unbiased prediction (G‐BLUP) (parametric), Bayesian ridge regression (Bayesian), and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) (nonparametric) to capture different statistical assumptions underlying genomic prediction (de Los Campos et al.,2010; de los Campos et al.,2013; Gianola & Van Kaam,2008; Habier et al.,2013; Hoerl & Kennard,1970). The three whole‐genome regression (WGR) methods were performed in the R packageBGLR(Perez & de los Campos,2014). Raw phenotypic data from single years and EMMs across years of 234 genotyped accessions were used to predict GEBVs for both single‐year and across‐year analyses. Monte Carlo cross‐validation with 1000 iterations was performed to assess predictive ability (PA). In each iteration, 80% of the collection was randomly selected without replacement to build the training set, while GEBVs were predicted for the remaining 20% in the validation set. Pearson's correlation coefficients between EMMs and GEBVs (r^y,g^) were calculated to evaluate PA in this study (González‐Recio et al.,2014; Tusell et al.,2014). The accuracy of genomic prediction was calculated asr^y,g^/h^g2(Chen et al.,2011; Hosoya et al.,2021; Zhang et al.,2015), whereh^g2is the square root of theh^g2estimated above.

Segregating populations with 100 individuals per population were simulated using a factorial mating design with reciprocals from 54,522 crosses among 234 genotyped accessions using the R package PopVar (Mohammadi, Tiede, et al.,2015). Population mean (μ^) and genetic variance (σ^G2) for each simulated population were estimated using across‐year EMMs for TFC (TableS1), 24,154 SNP markers derived from Flex‐Seq data (DataS1), and a reference genetic map constructed from a large mapping population (n= 218) originated in the Rutgers breeding program (DataS2) using the R packageMAPpoly(Mollinari et al.,2020). The genetic parameters were evaluated for different groups of potential parents under phenotypic and genomic selection approaches. The EMM threshold to classify TFC levels in the germplasm collection was determined using the median of the EMM data. Accessions under 0.32 mg/g FW were categorized as low TFC, whereas those above 0.45 mg/g FW were high TFC. The thresholds for genomic selection were adjusted to fall within±0.04 mg/g FW of the phenotypic selection criteria, with low TFC defined as values below 0.36 mg/g FW and high TFC as values above 0.41 mg/g FW.

We quantified My3Gal, My3Ara, Q3Gal, Q3Glc, Q3Xyl, Q3Arap, Q3Araf, and Q3Rha in 247 fruited‐cranberry accessions. Q3Gal was the most abundant flavonol detected in cranberry fruit (47.5%;x¯= 0.09–0.38 mg/g FW), followed by My3Gal (19.8%;x¯= 0.02–0.18 mg/g FW), Q3Rha (11.6%;x¯= 0.02–0.33 mg/g FW), and Q3Araf (8.5%;x¯= 0.01–0.09 mg/g FW). In contrast, My3Ara (4.0%;x¯= 0.00–0.05 mg/g FW), Q3Xyl (3.7%;x¯= 0.00–0.04 mg/g FW), Q3Glc (2.8%;x¯= 0.00–0.04 mg/g FW), and Q3Arap (2.1%;x¯= 0.00–0.03 mg/g FW) were present in lower concentrations in cranberry fruit (TableS1).

The quantified flavonols contributed to a wide range of TFC in the germplasm collection (x¯= 0.17–0.75 mg/g FW). We observed a moderate phenotypic correlation for TFC across years (r^= 0.27;p<0.0001; Figure1A). Relative to this, individual flavonol compounds exhibited a spectrum from weak to strong phenotypic correlation across years (FigureS2A,C,E,G,I,K,M,O). For example, Q3Gal showed the weakest correlation across years (r^= 0.29), whereas the strongest correlation was noticed for Q3Rha (r^= 0.75).

(B) Estimated marginal mean (EMM) differences of TFC for the entire collection (population), breeding lines, landraces, and wild accessions across 2 years. FW, fruit weight.

We did not observe significant differences across subgroups for TFC except between wild and landrace subgroups (p= 0.01; Figure1B). Similarly, although we detected statistically significant differences for My3Gal across subgroups (p<0.05; FigureS2B), individual flavonols showed either nonsignificant differences (My3Ara, Q3Xyl, and Q3Rha) or between some subgroup comparisons (FigureS2D,F,H,J,L,N,P).

Narrow‐sense genomic heritability (h2^g) estimate was moderate for TFC (h2^g= 0.40) and ranged from moderate to strong for individual flavonols (h2^g= 0.45–0.85; Table1). In general, theh2^gestimates varied across subgroups. The wild subgroup showed the highesth2^gfor several traits, including TFC (h2^g= 0.40), My3Ara (h2^g= 0.75), Q3Gal (h2^g= 0.44), Q3Arap (h2^g= 0.87), and Q3Rha (h2^g= 0.88). In contrast, the breeding subgroup displayed the highesth2^gestimate only for Q3Xyl (h2^g= 0.65). These results aligned with the additive genetic variance observed across subgroups (Table1). The wild subgroup consistently exhibited higher additive genetic variance (σ^A2), underscoring its potential as a reservoir for genetic diversity. For example,σ^A2for TFC in the wild subgroup reached3.9e−3, followed by the landrace subgroup (σ^A2=2.5e−3) and breeding subgroup (σ^A2=1.1e−3). Similarly, the wild subgroup showed higherσ^A2than both the landrace and breeding subgroups for two of the most abundant flavonols (Q3Gal and Q3Rha) in this collection (Table1). My3Gal, another abundant flavonol in this study, displayed the highestσ^A2in the landrace subgroup (5.8e−4) compared to both the breeding (σ^A2=1.3e−4) and wild (σ^A2=4.4e−4) subgroups.

Variance component estimates for flavonols identified in Rutgers cranberry germplasm.

Note: Genomic narrow‐sense heritability (h2^g), additive genetic variance (σ^A2), and coefficient of additive genetic variation (CVA) were measured across 234 samples for 2 years, 2016 and 2017.

Abbreviations: My3Ara, myricetin‐3‐arabinoside; My3Gal, myricetin‐3‐galactoside; Q3Araf, quercetin‐3‐arabinofuranoside; Q3Arap, quercetin 3‐arabinopyranoside; Q3Gal, quercetin‐3‐galactoside; Q3Glc, quercetin‐3‐glucoside; Q3Rha, quercetin‐3‐rhamnoside; Q3Xyl, quercetin‐3‐xylopyranoside; TFC, total flavonol content.

The coefficient of additive genetic variation (CVA) varied notably across flavonols in this collection (Table1).CVAwas moderate for TFC (CVA= 0.15), Q3Gal (CVA= 0.17), My3Gal (CVA= 0.29), Q3Xyl (CVA= 0.27), and Q3Araf (CVA= 0.27), suggesting more gradual phenotypic shifts under selection. In contrast, the higherCVAvalues observed for My3Ara (CVA= 0.40), Q3Glc (CVA= 0.38), Q3Arap (CVA= 0.38), and Q3Rha (CVA= 0.55) might imply stronger potential for response to selection. These traits stand out as promising candidates for breeding programs focused on accelerating the genetic improvement of flavonol‐rich varieties. In this context,CVAvalues for TFC, My3Ara, Q3Gal, and Q3Rha in the wild and landrace subgroups revealed the greater breedability in these populations (Table1). For instance, the wild subgroup exhibited nearly twice theCVAfor TFC than the breeding subgroup (CVA= 0.09). The most pronounced difference was observed for Q3Rha, where the wild subgroup showed aCVAof 0.74 compared to 0.33 in the breeding subgroup.

Phenotypic and additive genetic correlations among flavonols revealed weak to strong associations (Figure2). We identified moderate to strong positive phenotypic correlations between TFC and individual flavonol compounds (r^P= 0.54–0.84). However, the additive genetic correlations between these traits were comparatively weaker (r^A= 0.31–0.73). The phenotypic correlation between the most abundant flavonols and TFC ranged from 0.54 (Q3Rha) to 0.84 (Q3Gal), with genetic‐level correlations decreasing by 32% for My3Gal and 20% for Q3Gal and increasing by 15% for Q3Rha. In contrast, My3Gal showed weak genetic correlations with Q3Gal (r^A= 0.09) and Q3Rha (r^A= 0.08), while Q3Gal was also weakly correlated with Q3Rha (r^A= 0.10). Similarly, we observed discrepancies between phenotypic and additive genetic correlations among flavonols (Figure2). For example, My3Ara and Q3Gal exhibited a weak positive phenotypic correlation (r^P= 0.14). By contrast, their additive genetic correlation was negative (r^A= 0.35).

Phenotypic and additive genetic correlation among flavonol traits. Phenotypic and additive genetic correlations for flavonol traits, with the upper section based on estimated marginal means and the lower portion derived from genomic‐estimated breeding values of 237 genotyped accessions across 2 years. My3Ara, myricetin‐3‐arabinoside; My3Gal, myricetin‐3‐galactoside; Q3Araf, quercetin‐3‐arabinofuranoside; Q3Arap, quercetin 3‐arabinopyranoside; Q3Gal, quercetin‐3‐galactoside; Q3Glc, quercetin‐3‐glucoside; Q3Rha, quercetin‐3‐rhamnoside; Q3Xyl, quercetin‐3‐xylopyranoside; TFC, total flavonol content.

Our PCA, using GEBVs derived from the multivariate model, revealed a clear separation between individuals and flavonol compounds (Figure3A). Accessions on the positive side of PC1 (32.4% explained variance) accounted for a large percentage of TFC and individual flavonol variation. Notably, most of these accessions with higher breeding values for flavonol accumulation were wild, followed by landrace and breeding subgroups. Additionally, flavonol compounds showed a differentiated organization along PC2 (27.4% explained variance), where myricetin‐derived compounds and Q3Glc were separated from quercetin‐derived compounds.

Observations of a marked population structure for wild and a more diverse distribution for landraces and breeding lines (Figure4) led to the integration of genotypic and phenotypic data to gain insights into flavonol profiles across the cranberry collection (Figure3B; FigureS3). We identified five main clusters within the germplasm collection, each based on distinct genetic relationships and flavonol profiles. The dendrogram branches grouped accessions based on geographic origins, underlying a potential link between genetic clustering and environmental adaptation (Figure3B; FigureS3; TableS1). For example, one of the clusters enriched in myricetin‐derived compounds (cluster V) predominantly included accessions such as NJ91‐9, NJ91‐10, NJ91‐12, and NJ91‐13 from Massachusetts. However, within these primary clusters, several subbranches were identified that highlight further diversity in flavonol profiles and uncover complex patterns of genetic differentiation. For instance, Cluster IV exhibited the greatest genetic diversity or spread (FigureS3) from various geographic origins, including New Jersey (e.g., NJ91‐7), Delaware (e.g., NJ93‐117), and Michigan (e.g., NJ93‐120).

Clustering of wild cranberry accessions and broader genetic variation among landraces and breeding lines. Principal component analysis (PCA) of 234 accessions genotyped with 24,155 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

The collection was categorized into low, medium, and high levels of TFC, and for specific flavonols, with the medium range defined by the median of the EMM data distribution. Accessions with values below this range were categorized as having low TFC and flavonol levels, while those above were classified as high. We identified between 2.4% and 13% of the collection as flavonol‐high content‐fruited accessions. (TableS2), where 27 accessions were considered high TFC (>0.45 mg/g FW) in single and across years, 25 for My3Gal (>0.10 mg/g FW), 32 for My3Ara (>0.02 mg/g FW), 23 for Q3Gal (>0.21 mg/g FW), six for Q3Glc (>0.02 mg/g FW), 14 for Q3Xyl (>0.02 mg/g FW), 36 for Q3Arap (>0.01 mg/g FW), 28 for Q3Araf (>0.04 mg/g FW), and 17 for Q3Rha (>0.06 mg/g FW).

We noticed that the most favorable alleles for high levels of TFC and individual flavonols came from wild and landraces (TableS2). Considering the three most abundant flavonols detected in the collection, 19 accessions exhibited a high content of Q3Gal, nine for My3Gal, and eight for Q3Rha. Notably, the wild accession NJ91‐12‐12 showed Q3Gal levels (x¯= 0.38 mg/g FW) that were twice as high as the population mean (μ^= 0.18 mg/g FW). Similarly, the My3Gal content in NJ91‐9‐15 (x¯= 0.18 mg/g FW), US88‐5 (Bain4;x¯= 0.16 mg/g FW), and NJ91‐10‐4 (x¯= 0.16 mg/g FW) was double that of the population mean (μ^= 0.08 mg/g FW). Exceptional levels of Q3Rha were observed in NJ93‐117‐14 (x¯= 0.19 mg/g FW) and NJ93‐117‐9 (x¯= 0.33 mg/g FW) at five and eight times above the population mean (μ^= 0.04 mg/g FW), respectively. The landrace US92‐2‐7 (Garwood Bell) was the only accession that showed high content of these three flavonols (x¯= 0.28, 0.14, and 0.06 mg/g FW, respectively). Moreover, US89‐2 (Beckwith) was the only accession from the breeding subgroup that showed high TFC (x¯= 0.68 mg/g FW) alongside elevated concentrations of Q3Ara (x¯= 0.03 mg/g FW), Q3Gal (x¯= 0.30 mg/g FW), Q3Xyl (x¯= 0.04 mg/g FW), Q3Araf (x¯= 0.09 mg/g FW), and Q3Rha (x¯= 0.08 mg/g FW).

Our genome‐wide association study (GWAS) of the genetic architecture underlying TFC and flavonols in the germplasm collection identified significant associations only for Q3Rha on Chromosomes 3, 11, and 12 (Figure5A; FigureS4). The GWAS signals on Chromosomes 11 and 12 were unstable across years and explained between 3.9% and 8.9% of the genetic variance (Table2). In contrast, the GWAS peak on Chromosome 3 was consistent in both years (Figure5A) and accounted for 15.8%–19.7% of the GVE by the significant SNP (Table2).

The favorable allele “A” at position 20,409,239 bp on Chromosome 3 was rare in the collection, present only in 6.84% of the accessions, and was found primarily within heterozygous genotypes (Figure6A). The mean Q3Rha content in the homozygous group carrying the favorable allele “A” (x¯= 0.17 mg/g FW) was four times higher than in the group homozygous for the alternative allele “G” (Figure6A). The homozygous genotypes NJ91‐117‐4 (x¯= 0.19 mg/g FW), NJ91‐117‐9 (x¯= 0.33 mg/g FW), NJ91‐117‐23 (x¯= 0.10 mg/g FW), and US88‐10 (x¯= 0.04 mg/g FW) carried the favorable allele “A” and exhibited varying levels of Q3Rha content. Given the positive and moderate phenotypic and genetic correlation between Q3Rha and TFC (Figure3), we examined the impact of this locus on TFC (Figure6B). We observed an effect on TFC, though it was less pronounced than for Q3Rha, with only a 1.4‐fold difference between the homozygous genotypes. The four homozygous genotypes for the favorable allele “A” in this study exhibited TFC levels ranging from 0.33 (NJ93‐117‐23) to 0.75 mg/g FW (NJ93‐117‐9). Gene action analysis for the locus associated with Q3Rha revealed a significant additive effect (α^=0.06;p=1.29e−2) and a dominance effect (δ^=0.06;p=1.39e−14), suggesting nearly complete dominance (|δ^/α^|= 0.89; Figure6A).

Given the stability of the Chromosome 3 locus (Figure5A) and its significant contribution to both phenotypic and genetic variance in the collection (Table2), we investigated candidate genes within the associated genomic region (5.04 Mb; FDR‐correctedp‐value<0.01). This region contains 548 genes, of which 106 have known functions based on homology withArabidopsis thaliana(≥50%amino acid identity; TableS3). In particular, the most significant SNP (20,409,239 bp;p=1.22×10−4) maps within a putative MYB gene (Vmac_016505), homologous (56% identity) toA. thalianaMYB4R1 (At3g18100). Functional studies in Tartary buckwheat demonstrated that MYB4R1 plays a central role in coordinating flavonoid production and the UV‐B response (M. Liu et al.,2022). Furthermore, MYB4R1 expression increased under heat stress inArabidopsisseedlings (López‐Torrejón et al.,2013) andPopulus tomentosaCarr. (Ren et al.,2019), highlighting its involvement in stress responses.

We observed that the loci detected on Chromosomes 3, 11, and 12 segregated exclusively within the wild subgroup (Figure5B). The GWAS signals on Chromosomes 3 and 11 were large‐effect loci (GVE = 18.9% –20.5% and 15.1%–16.5%, respectively) and detected in both years, whereas the locus on Chromosome 12 exhibited a minor effect (GVE = 1.5%–5.5%; Figure5C; Table2) and was identified only in 2016. In addition to these three loci identified for Q3Rha in the wild subgroup, we also detected two additional loci on Chromosomes 5 and 9 (Figure5C), accounting for 3.8%–12.0% and 7.3%–18.9% of the genetic variance, respectively (Table2).

The GWAS analysis within wild and landrace subgroups detected several unstable and mostly nonsignificant signals for TFC and flavonols (FiguresS5andS6; Table2). We observed that these loci accounted for a substantial portion of the genetic variance, which was not fully captured by the phenotypic variation. For example, in 2017, only 44% of the GVE by the locus associated with TFC on Chromosome 8 in the wild subgroup was reflected in the phenotypic variation.

We evaluated the potential of applying genomic prediction models for TFC in the breeding program by leveraging accessions from the diversity collection. Three genome‐wide regression models were implemented to estimate GEBVs (Table3)—G‐BLUP, RKHS regression, and ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (RR‐BLUP). The three WGR methods yielded similar PA for TFC (r^y,g^=0.12−0.26).

Note: Predictive ability and standard deviation within and across years for three genomic prediction methods—genomic‐best linear unbiased predictor (G‐BLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert space regression (RKHS), and ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (RR‐BLUP)‐are presented. Column headings indicate the training sets, and rows indicate the test sets. Raw phenotypic data were used for single‐year predictions, whereas estimated marginal means were employed for across‐year predictions.

The PA of the WGR methods highlights differences based on the training and test sets used. We observed that PA was greater within years (r^y,g^=0.18−0.24) compared to using a single year to predict the other (r^y,g^=0.12−0.15). In contrast, training on a combined dataset across years resulted in higher PA for both within‐year (r^y,g^=0.20−0.23) and across‐year test sets (r^y,g^=0.25−0.26).

Although GEBVs were shrunk toward the mean (Figure7), the moderate genomic prediction accuracy across years (0.40–0.41) supported our decision to simulate populations for both phenotypic and genomic selection. Our truncation cutoff approach to categorize accessions into low, medium, and high TFC levels identified 50 and 42 accessions with high TFC levels through phenotypic and genomic selection, respectively. Most of the genotypes selected for high TFC were wild (n= 27 and 27, respectively), followed by landraces (n= 18 and 11, respectively), and breeding lines (n= 5 and 4, respectively). However, we observed seven high TFC accessions that overlapped between both strategies: NJ91‐11‐3, NJ91‐12‐12, NJ91‐12‐3, NJ91‐7‐12, NJ91‐7‐19, NJ91‐7‐5, NJ91‐9‐15, NJ93‐117‐10, NJ93‐117‐4, and NJ93‐117‐9, and US88‐72 and US92‐9‐2 (both known as Rezin McFarlin).

Total flavonol content (TFC) plotted against TFC genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). Data were evaluated for two years, 2016 and 2017, for the subgroups breeding, landrace, and wild.

We simulated 54,522 reciprocal crosses, each with 100 progeny, using the germplasm collection (n= 234) to evaluate the introgression of high TFC alleles from wild, landrace, and breeding accessions into a breeding genetic background through phenotypic and genomic selection (Figure8). The simulation included all possible reciprocal crosses rather than preselecting specific crosses based on TFC classifications. Overall, both phenotypic and genomic selection strategies exhibited similar trends. For example, thewild×breedingcrosses exhibited similar patterns across strategies. However, we noticedbreeding×breedingcrosses distinguished between phenotypic and genomic selection, showing higher predicted genetic variance with genomic selection (Figure8B) than phenotypic selection (Figure8A). To identify potential crosses for long‐term genetic gain, we applied a 0.45 mg/g FW cutoff for the predicted population mean and2e−4for the predicted genetic variance. NJ93‐117‐9 was the only wild accession identified as high‐TFC accession between phenotypic and genomic selection that was crossed with 16 breeding accessions with different TFC classifications across both strategies (Figure8).

Cranberry fruit are rich in flavonoids that offer significant health benefits such as metabolic syndrome prevention and anticancer properties (Kowalska & Olejnik,2016; Pappas & Schaich,2009; Shabrova et al.,2011). These bioactive compounds also play a crucial role in biotic and abiotic stresses (Laoué et al.,2022). Flavonols, a subgroup of flavonoids, are abundant in cranberry fruit but have mainly been studied in a limited number of accessions (Abeywickrama et al.,2016; Šedbarė, Jakšāne, et al.,2023; Šedbarė, Siliņa, et al.,2022; Šedbarė, Pašakinskienė, et al.,2023; Urbstaite et al.,2022; Vvedenskaya & Vorsa,2004; Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al.,2017). Although these studies have provided valuable insights, they do not capture the genetic diversity within the species. Our study expanded the scope of flavonols in cranberry fruit by including 247 accessions that form one of the most genetically diverse collections of cranberry genotypes worldwide (Diaz‐Garcia et al.,2020; Vorsa et al.,2002; TableS1). The eight quantified flavonols accounted for a wide range of TFC in the germplasm collection (TableS1). Q3Gal, My3Gal, Q3Rha, and Q3Araf represented 87.4% of TFC in cranberry fruit and have previously been identified as the most predominant flavonols in cranberry fruit (Urbstaite et al.,2022; Šedbarė, Jakšāne, et al.,2023; Šedbarė, Siliņa, et al.,2022; Šedbarė, Pašakinskienė, et al.,2023; Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al.,2017). We observed limited differentiation in TFC (Figure1B) and individual flavanols (FigureS2) among cranberry subgroups. This lack of widespread differentiation is consistent with the low genetic divergence among cranberry subgroups reported by Diaz‐Garcia et al. (2020). Cranberry is a fruit crop with a relatively short domestication history, with the first modern cultivars developed in the 1950s by the USDA after fewer than 200 years of domestication and breeding. The limited number of breeding and selection cycles has primarily targeted yield and fruit size, leading to significant increases in these traits in modern cultivars. In contrast, other fruit quality traits, such as secondary metabolites, have not been direct targets of improvement and demonstrate subtle differences between wild and cultivated germplasm (Diaz‐Garcia et al.,2020; Vorsa & Zalapa,2019). The population structure analysis revealed a distinct cluster for the wild and a wider distribution among landraces and breeding lines (Figure4). However, the low variance explained by the first two PCs (11.41%) suggests that the population structure is limited, likely due to the short selection and breeding history. Similar patterns were observed in previous analyses (Diaz‐Garcia et al.,2020), where wild accessions were grouped; in contrast, the landrace and breeding subgroups were broadly distributed. The genetic diversity observed from landrace and breeding subgroups underlines the impact of domestication and breeding efforts, which may have introduced greater genetic variability within these groups. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining genetic banks in breeding programs to enhance the adaptive potential and trait improvement in cranberry.

Theh2^gestimates for flavonols in cranberry provided insights into their genetic control and potential for improvement through breeding. The heritability for TFC was moderate (h2^g= 0.40), with individual flavonols exhibiting heritability estimates ranging from moderate to strong (h2^g= 0.45–0.85; Table1). These estimates varied across subgroups, with the wild cranberry subgroup consistently displaying the highest heritability for traits such as TFC (h2^g= 0.40) and specific flavonols like My3Ara (h2^g= 0.75), Q3Gal (h2^g= 0.44), Q3Arap (h2^g= 0.87), and Q3Rha (h2^g= 0.88). These findings suggest greater genetic variation for these traits in wild germplasm, which could be leveraged to enhance flavonol content in cultivated cranberries. Comparable studies in blueberry, a closely related species within the genusVaccinium, have reported heritability estimates for similar phytochemical traits. Connor et al. (2002) and Mengist et al. (2020) indicated a wide range of heritability estimates for flavonoids, ranging from 0.15 to 0.80 depending on the compound and genetic background. While differences in study design and germplasm composition may contribute to variations in heritability values, these findings reflect the shared genetic and metabolic characteristics between cranberry and blueberry. Both species exhibit conserved pathways for flavonoid biosynthesis, likely underpinning the observed heritability. The high heritability observed in cranberry, particularly for the wild subgroup, underscores the potential for selecting and incorporating these genotypes into breeding programs to enhance flavonol profiles. The variability in heritability across subgroups also underlines the influence of domestication and breeding on genetic diversity, which may have narrowed the genetic control of certain traits. These findings, coupled with insights from related species like blueberry, provide a foundational framework for advancing the genetic improvement of flavonoid‐richVacciniumcrops.

TheCVArevealed notable differences in the breedability of flavonols in cranberry fruit (Table1). ModerateCVAvalues for traits like TFC, Q3Gal, and My3Gal (0.15–0.29) suggest that these traits may exhibit slower rates of phenotypic change under selection. In contrast, the higherCVAvalues observed for My3Ara (0.40), Q3Glc (0.38), Q3Arap (0.38), and Q3Rha (0.55) point to greater adaptive capacity and genetic variability. These results underscore the link between additive genetic variation and the potential for genetic improvement, where traits with higherCVAvalues are more likely to diverge phenotypically and respond rapidly to selection pressures (Opedal et al.,2023). This emphasizes the opportunity for breeders to leverage traits with greater genetic variation to accelerate the development of flavonol‐rich cranberry varieties.

We observed weak to strong phenotypic and additive genetic correlations between flavonols (Figure2). Notably, phenotypic correlations between TFC and individual flavonol compounds were moderate to strong (r^P= 0.54–0.84), whereas additive genetic correlations for these traits were comparatively weaker (r^A= 0.31–0.73). An analysis of 32 plant studies covering more than 4000 phenotypic and genetic correlations in 27 species reported that genetic correlations were generally stronger than phenotypic correlations in 85% of the comparisons (Waitt & Levin,1998). However, phenotypic correlations measured under controlled conditions might not accurately reflect genetic correlations since greater environmental variability could weaken the alignment between phenotypic and genetic correlations (Searle,1961; Willis et al.,1991). These results might suggest environmental factors influenced this disparity, given the high sensitivity of flavonol content to external conditions (Mierziak et al.,2014; Qaderi et al.,2023).

Our PCA revealed clear separation among individuals and flavonol compounds (Figure3A). PC1, which explained 32.4% of the variance, distinguished predominantly wild and landraces with higher breeding values for flavonol accumulation. PC2, explaining 27.4% of the variance, separated flavonol compounds, with myricetin‐derived compounds and Q3Glc placed opposite quercetin‐derived compounds. These findings align with observations by Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al. (2017), who similarly identified the variation of flavonol along PC2 driven by a different cluster of compounds derived from myricetin and quercetin. Although Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al. (2017) reported comparable patterns for PC2, they concluded that cultivar differences accounted for a small percentage of total flavonol variation. This finding might be explained by the limited genetic variability captured in their study, where only eight genotypes were evaluated. Interestingly, Y. Wang, Johnson‐Cicalese, et al. (2017) observed that PC2 scores could distinguish cultivars based on flavonol profiles. For example, three replicates of Howes showed low negative PC2 scores, corresponding to the highest levels of My3Gal, My3Ara, and Q3Glc, along with the lowest levels of Q3Xyl and Q3Araf, among the eight cultivars tested. Conversely, two Ben Lear replicates displayed high, positive PC2 scores, consistent with lower levels of My3Gal, My3Ara, and Q3Glc and higher levels of Q3Gal, Q3Xyl, and Q3Araf. Our phenotypic and genotypic data integration revealed distinct clustering linked to flavonol variation (Figure3B; FigureS3). Hierarchical clustering identified five main groups characterized by genetic relationships and flavonol profiles, with geographic origin playing a key role. Neyhart et al. (2022) reported that although cranberry exhibits relatively low overall genetic variation, local adaptation to different environmental conditions influences genetic diversity. Šedbarė, Jakšāne, et al. (2023) also applied hierarchical clustering to flavonol composition, identifying three groups among cranberry cultivars with distinct flavonol profiles. They reported variations in flavonol compounds, such as Q3Gal and My3Gal, that differentiated clusters and highlighted cultivar‐specific traits. These findings, combined with ours, underscore the importance of both genetic diversity and geographic origin in shaping flavonol profiles. Despite limited phenotypic differentiation across cranberry subgroups, we identified accessions with exceptional flavonol profiles that are highly relevant for breeding programs (Figure1B; FigureS1B,D,F,H,J,L,N, P). Wild and landraces contributed the most favorable alleles associated with elevated TFC and individual flavonols (TableS2), showing their value in enhancing cranberry flavonol content. These results uncover the potential of specific wild accessions to enhance flavonol profiles in cranberry through targeted breeding efforts. Interestingly, while most accessions with elevated flavonol content originated from wild or landrace subgroups, Beckwith (US89‐2) stood out as the sole breeding line exhibiting high TFC alongside elevated concentrations of multiple flavonols, including Q3Ara, Q3Gal, Q3Xyl, Q3Araf, and Q3Rha (TableS2). Originally released as part of the USDA's cranberry breeding program initiated in 1929, Beckwith was developed for resistance to false‐blossom disease with improved productivity and fruit quality traits (Vorsa & Johnson‐Cicalese,2012). However, like many cultivars from that era, Beckwith is no longer widely cultivated. Its notable flavonol profile in this study suggests that it retains valuable genetic variability, which could be reintroduced into modern breeding programs to enhance cranberry flavonol composition.

The analysis of the genetic architecture of flavonols revealed their polygenic nature and the influence of environmental factors on flavonols in cranberry fruit (Table2; Figure5; FigureS4). This complexity is characterized by highly modular transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis, with distinct branches and regulatory mechanisms that ensure context‐specific metabolite production (W. Liu et al.,2021; Quattrocchio et al.,2006). Environmental variation, including UV light, temperature fluctuations, and other abiotic stressors (Mierziak et al.,2014; Qaderi et al.,2023), likely contributed to the observed instability of GWAS signals, as most loci were detected inconsistently and explained only a minor proportion of genetic variance (Table2). Furthermore, the potential co‐localization of loci associated with different flavonol derivatives, such as Q3Gal and Q3Arap on Chromosome 5, and the overlap between TFC and Q3Araf loci on Chromosome 8 suggest an interconnected regulatory framework that involves multiple enzymatic and regulatory nodes, which influences the coordinated accumulation of diverse metabolites (W. Liu et al.,2021).

The stable locus on Chromosome 3 associated with Q3Rha explained a substantial proportion of genetic variance (GVE = 15.8%–19.7%; Table2). The favorable allele “A” at this locus was rare (6.84%), where the presence of both alleles is essential for its substantial effect on the Q3Rha content (|δ^/α^|= 0.89; Figure6). Diaz‐Garcia et al. (2018) identified a locus on Chromosome 3 associated with anthocyanin and proanthocyanin content in cranberry using a biparental population. While Diaz‐Garcia et al. (2021) provided a physical position for the locus within the interval 9,869,916–12,333,384 bp on Chromosome 3, our significant SNP is located far from this region (20,409,239 bp), indicating that the two loci might not overlap. This distinction may suggest that these loci have different regulatory mechanisms or genetic influences on flavonoid biosynthesis in cranberry. Strikingly, the most significant SNP was located within an MYB gene homologous toA. thalianaMYB4R1 (At3g18100), implicated in flavonoid biosynthesis and stress responses (M. Liu et al.,2022; López‐Torrejón et al.,2013; Ren et al.,2019). Although MYB4R1 is a strong candidate gene for regulating Q3Rha content, its role in cranberry fruit needs to be functionally validated.

Cranberry breeding faces several challenges due to its long cultivar development cycles, high evaluation costs, and reliance on a few large biparental populations (Covarrubias‐Pazaran et al.,2018). These constraints point out the potential of genomic selection to accelerate cranberry improvement by enabling early, accurate selection and reducing dependency on field‐based phenotyping (Consortium et al.,2021; Crossa et al.,2017; Kumar et al.,2024). We evaluated genomic prediction to enhance TFC in cranberry fruit, leveraging a diverse collection (TableS1) to address breeding challenges. Our findings indicate the need to select specific accessions as flavonol‐rich candidates (Table1B; TableS2) while harnessing genetic diversity (Figure4) to improve traits like fruit quality, yield, and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, we used three WGR models to evaluate PA across different scenarios, including within‐year, across‐year, and combined‐year training populations (Table3). Our results showed similar PA across the three WGR methods for TFC (Table3), aligning with studies that demonstrate different genomic prediction models often yield similar levels of predictability (Azodi et al.,2019; Bari et al.,2021; Jiménez et al.,2023; Technow et al.,2014; Zhao et al.,2013). The PA was higher when models were trained and tested within the same year (r^y,g^=0.18−0.24) compared to predicting across different years (r^y,g^=0.12−0.15), reflecting how genotype‐by‐environment interactions can complicate genomic selection by reducing prediction accuracy across variable conditions (Montesinos‐López et al.,2024). Moreover, training on combined datasets across years improved PA for both within‐year (r^y,g^=0.20−0.23) and across‐year (r^y,g^=0.25−0.26), showing that pooling data from multiple environments enhance the power of genomic selection (Haile et al.,2021; N. Wang, Wang, et al.,2020). The modest PA observed for TFC (Table3), characterized by the shrinkage of predicted values toward the population mean (Figure7), might be attributed to several potential factors. First, Our GWAS analysis (Table2; Figure5A) andh^g2estimate (0.40) suggest TFC is a polygenic trait shaped by the combined effects of genetic and environmental factors. Traits with complex genetic architectures and low‐moderate heritability often result in reduced predictive accuracy (Clark et al.,2012; Kaler et al.,2022), indicating the challenges inherent in modeling such traits. Second, the limited number of accessions analyzed in this study for a trait with moderate heritability may have been insufficient to support robust model training. Simulations indicate that predicting GEBVs for traits with moderate heritability demands large training populations (Hayes et al.,2009). For instance, in a full‐sib family with a heritability of 0.5, a sample size of at least 1000 genotypes was necessary to reach a prediction accuracy close to 0.75. Third, the distinct clustering of wild accessions and the broader distribution of landraces and breeding lines observed in our PCA (Figure4) highlight genetic divergence across subgroups within our dataset. This population structure and under‐representation of the breeding subgroup (TableS1) likely presented challenges for genomic prediction models. The PA may have been impacted by the genetic distance between the training and validation sets (Brault et al.,2022), influenced by factors such as differences in linkage disequilibrium (De Roos et al.,2009; Schopp et al.,2017), interactions between quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the genetic background (N. Wang, Wang, et al.,2012; Melchinger et al.,2008; Mohammadi, Blake, et al.,2015), and the occurrence of QTL alleles unique to specific subpopulations (A. Lorenz et al.,2012; Schulz‐Streeck et al.,2012).

The moderate accuracy of genomic prediction over years (0.40–0.41) suggests a meaningful relationship between observed and predicted values after accounting for theh^g2of TFC to warrant further exploration of genomic selection using simulated populations (Figure8). The limited overlap of high TFC accessions identified by phenotypic and genomic selection strategies (n= 7) underscores the complexity inherent in the selection of donor plants with favorable alleles to enhance TFC in cranberry. However, the simulation of 54,522 reciprocal crosses showed similar trends between both schemes (Figure8). With thresholds set at 0.45 mg/g FW for population mean and2e−4for genetic variance, NJ93‐117‐9 was the only wild high TFC accession identified across both strategies for long‐term genetic improvement. Although there are several difficulties in estimating accurate GEBVs for non‐phenotyped individuals in genomic selection schemes (Endelman & Jannink,2012; Müller et al.,2015), these findings could suggest that both phenotypic and genomic data offer a clear advantage by combining the precision of direct phenotypic evaluation with the broader applicability of genomic prediction. Therefore, further investigation is needed to address these challenges in cranberry breeding by optimizing training populations and applying genomic‐enabled breeding strategies.
