Safety in the construction sector is a critical concern due to the high frequency of accidents and their impact on worker health, project timelines, and productivity. To the best of our knowledge, no prior study in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has applied quantitative time series forecasting to construction accident data. This study analyzes over a decade of monthly accident records (January 2011–September 2022) from the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) using three univariate forecasting models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Holt–Winters exponential smoothing, and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES). The analysis identifies recurring seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and quantifies the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on accident rates. SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) achieved the best performance, with a Mean Absolute Error of 74.75 and Root Mean Squared Error of 103.77, effectively capturing both seasonal cycles and trend behavior. By integrating historical pattern analysis with predictive modeling, the study provides a data-driven basis for proactive safety planning and accident prevention in the Saudi construction industry.

The construction sector significantly influences local economies but is characterized by substantial risks, leading to severe losses in both human resources and material assets1. Globally, the construction industry contributes heavily to the risk landscape of many nations2, with various factors resulting in adverse consequences such as workforce absenteeism, project delays, and long-term disabilities3. The industry incurs substantial losses due to incidents including occupational injuries and illnesses, with fatal accidents imposing significant personal, societal, and economic costs4.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the construction sector is a major contributor to economic development. However, ensuring safe working conditions remains a persistent challenge5. As the construction market grows, there is a rising demand for stricter safety regulations, improved building standards, and more environmentally responsible approaches. The focus on worker well-being and site safety has become increasingly important, highlighting the sector’s responsibility to uphold sustainable practices and a positive reputation6. The industry is particularly prone to accidents and injuries due to the dynamic and complex nature of construction sites, where multiple teams often work simultaneously on varied tasks. The pressure to meet project timelines and avoid financial penalties often adds to these risks. In 2014, 51% of the 69,241 occupational accidents and injuries reported in the private sector were linked to construction activities7,8. In many developing countries, workplace health and safety are frequently neglected. The sector often depends heavily on manual labor, lacks effective hazard control measures, and follows record-keeping practices that do not meet international standards9.

In KSA, where the workforce numbers around 10.3 million, the construction sector continues to report a significantly higher rate of accidents and injuries compared to other industries10. Despite various initiatives aimed at improving safety standards, the occurrence of fatal incidents remains alarmingly high. Although technological advancements and regulatory frameworks have been introduced, the ongoing presence of accidents points to persistent challenges in enforcing safety protocols and effectively managing on-site risks. To the best of our knowledge, no prior study in the KSA has applied quantitative time series forecasting to predict construction accidents. This study investigates construction-related accidents in KSA by analyzing over a decade of historical data through time series modeling approaches. The analysis focuses on uncovering recurring patterns and long-term trends in accident occurrences, allowing for a clearer understanding of how incidents are distributed over time. By applying predictive time series models, the study forecasts future accident rates, which can help inform more effective safety planning and support proactive decision-making within the construction sector. In addressing this gap, the research combines extensive accident records with seasonal-trend modeling and explicitly evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on accident trends, providing novel insights for both policymakers and industry practitioners.

The construction industry is widely regarded as one of the most hazardous sectors, with a high occurrence of accidents and fatalities. Identifying the underlying factors contributing to these incidents is crucial for creating effective prevention strategies. Research conducted in various regions has provided valuable insights into the causes and trends of construction-related accidents. A study in the United Kingdom (UK) identified three primary factors influencing fatal and significant incidents in construction: micro factors (e.g., worker-specific issues), mezzo factors (e.g., project management and supervisory roles), and macro factors (e.g., organizational structures and procurement processes)11. The findings reflect the complex interaction among individual, organizational, and systemic factors within the construction industry12. Further research found that 70% of construction accidents arise from workforce-related problems, workplace conditions, equipment deficiencies, material inadequacies, and ineffective risk management13–15.

Globally, research has focused on various dimensions of construction accidents, including demographic factors, economic conditions, and enterprise size. For example, studies have shown that sex differences, time of day, and economic cycles significantly influence accident rates16,17. In Italy, economic cycles were linked to variations in accident occurrences18, while in Taiwan, employment growth in the manufacturing sector was associated with an increased severity of injuries19. Small construction enterprises, especially those not linked to government projects, reported the highest number of incidents, indicating the need for stricter inspections and improved safety training20. In the United States, a strong correlation was observed between roof falls and economic cycles, highlighting the dynamic nature of risk factors in construction21.

In the KSA, the construction industry relies heavily on a workforce largely made up of foreign employees engaged in various roles, including management, contracting, and manual labor22. However, a significant portion of these workers enter the sector with limited training and insufficient skill development, which heightens their exposure to workplace hazards and increases the likelihood of accidents. The harsh climate combined with inherently hazardous working environments, intensifies the risks faced by construction workers. These conditions often contribute to limited awareness of occupational health and safety practices, insufficient on-site supervision, and a consistently high rate of incidents23,24. Notably, the western region of KSA, with Jeddah as a key hub, recorded 34% of all workplace accidents in 2014, which shows a serious safety challenge25. The construction industry is characterized by dispersed project locations, intricate work environments, and frequent workforce turnover, all of which contribute to heightened safety risks and operational challenges in maintaining consistent safety standards26. In response to the elevated risk levels within the construction sector, the Saudi government has implemented several reform measures to improve safety conditions and minimize hazards affecting both workers and the environment. These initiatives reflect an ongoing effort to strengthen regulatory oversight and promote a safer, more sustainable construction industry27,28. Research in the region has predominantly focused on three key areas, which include the management of safety processes, the influence of organizational and individual characteristics, and the analysis of accident data. Studies on safety processes have emphasized monitoring systems, knowledge dissemination, and the implementation of safety measures29,30. Investigations into organizational and worker-related factors have highlighted the critical role of site management and workforce training in reducing accident rates31. Table1shows the compilation of global studies on construction industry occupational accidents.

This study employs a comprehensive approach to assess and forecast construction accidents in Saudi Arabia, utilizing historical data from the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) covering the period from January 2011 to September 2022. The dataset includes detailed information on accident types, worker demographics, and regional distributions. Time series modeling techniques, including Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing), and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), were employed to analyze and forecast accident occurrences. Model performance was evaluated using statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Figure1illustrate the research process.

Construction accident data analysis forms the foundation of numerous studies, encompassing statistical assessments, cost evaluations and explorations of causation44. The construction accident data used in this study was obtained from the GOSI in KSA. GOSI collects and maintains comprehensive records on workplace accidents, including fatalities, injuries, and occupational diseases, as part of its responsibility to ensure financial protection for workers and their families. The construction accident dataset obtained from GOSI covers the period from January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2022 and provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to accidents within the Saudi construction industry. The dataset includes detailed information on the nature of the accidents, the workers involved such as their age, nationality, and job specialties, and the economic activities of the construction companies. It also provides insights into the regions where accidents occurred and the specific dates of these incidents. By analyzing this dataset, various patterns and trends can be identified, shedding light on the critical factors influencing safety outcomes on construction sites.

Prior to analysis, the dataset was processed through a series of preprocessing steps to maintain quality and consistency. These steps included verification of data integrity, removal of duplicate records, and checks for missing or inconsistent entries. Construction accident counts were aggregated to a monthly frequency to align with the time series modeling framework of the study. Outlier detection was performed through visual inspection and statistical screening to identify anomalous records that could unduly influence model estimates.

It is a statistical time series forecasting model that combines trend, seasonality, and noise into a unified framework45. It extends ARIMA by adding seasonal components, making it suitable for time series with recurring seasonal patterns46. The SARIMA model is denoted as Eq.1.

Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) is a forecasting strategy suitable for time series data lacking pronounced trend or seasonal variation47. The technique assigns exponentially declining weights to historical observations, thereby placing greater emphasis on more recent data while progressively diminishing the influence of older values. This characteristic renders SES effective in modeling processes where data oscillates around a relatively constant mean without systematic directional movement. In SES, for the next time period, the forecast is based on the current smoothed valueis given by Eq.14.

Where,indicate the predicted value for the upcoming time point andshows the level (smoothed estimate) at any time t.

The levelis updated using the observed valueat time t and the previous levelis given by Eq.15.

Where,denotes the observed value at any time t (e.g., number of accidents),is the previous smoothed value (previous level) and α is the smoothing parameter (0 < α < 1). If α is close to 1, the forecast relies heavily on the most recent accident count. If α is close to 0, the forecast gives more importance to past accident data.

Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing) is a time series forecasting strategy that extends SES by including components for trend and seasonality48. It is highly suitable for the data with both trends and seasonality. Holt-Winters has two variations i.e., additive model and multiplicative model. In case of additive model the seasonal effects remain constant while in case of multiplicative model, seasonal effects increase or decrease proportionally to the trend. Holt-Winters has level component, seasonal component and trend component. The level componentrepresents the smoothed value at timet, capturing the overall average of the series, which is given by Eq.16.

Where,βrepresents the smoothing parameter for the trend (0 <β< 1).

The seasonal componentcaptures repeating patterns, such as increased construction accidents during specific months due to seasonal factors like hot weather or active construction periods is given by Eq.19.

Where,is the smoothing parameter for the seasonal component, constrained within the range (0 << 1).

ME quantifies the systematic bias in a model’s predictive performance by computing the arithmetic mean of the residuals, defined as the differences between predicted and observed values, as expressed in Eq.20. A positive ME reflects a tendency of the model to over predict, whereas a negative ME signifies a consistent under prediction across the forecast horizon.

MAE quantifies the average magnitude of errors in predictions by taking the mean of the absolute deviations between forecasted and actual values, irrespective of the direction of the error, as shown in Eq.21. MAE serves as a direct metric of predictive accuracy, where lower values denote improved model performance and reduced overall deviation from observed outcomes.

MSE evaluates the average of the squared discrepancies between predicted and actual values, as presented in Eq.22. By squaring each error term, MSE disproportionately penalizes larger deviations, thereby increasing sensitivity to outliers. This characteristic makes MSE suitable in situations where substantial prediction errors carry greater consequences and must be minimized.

It is defined as the square root of the MSE and expressed in Eq.23, which quantifies the standard deviation of prediction errors. Unlike MSE, RMSE retains the same units as the original data, increasing its interpretability. Similar to MSE, it places greater emphasis on larger deviations, which makes it responsive to substantial forecasting inaccuracies.

The analysis is based on construction accident data, focusing on its distribution, frequencies, and temporal patterns. The section is divided into two main sub-sections. First, the distribution and frequency of construction accidents are explored to identify key accident types and their occurrence rates. This is followed by time series modeling of construction accidents, aimed at understanding trends and forecasting future occurrences for better safety management.

The results presented in Fig.2shows key accident types in the Saudi construction industry. The three major accident types identified are falls from high places, being struck by objects, and abrasions. These results indicate critical areas where specific safety measures are essential.

Frequent accidents in the Saudi construction industry.

The construction industry has a significant impact on the frequency of accidents, with the 30–35 age group with approximately 60,750 incidents, having the highest frequency of accidents, accounting for 21% of total incidents. The 35–40 age group had the lowest frequency, with approximately 50,450 incidents, constituting 17% of total accidents as shown in Fig.3. As individuals age, bone density naturally decreases, heightening the likelihood of fractures50. The lowest frequency is observed in the > 85 age group, with the number of accidents decreasing to about 1750. Interestingly, the 25–30 and > 80 years age groups had similar percentages of accidents (approximately 4%), despite a significant difference in the number of accidents (approximately 22,500 for the 25–30 years group and 2750 for the > 80 years group). Significantly there is substantial number of physical disability in workers to effect overall productivity51.

Workers aged 25–29 years are more likely to be subjected to work-related accidents, accounting for 23% of all injured workers. As their age increases, their possibility of suffering accidents decreases. This shows that older workers in the construction sector may experience a greater incidence of disability following injuries than their younger counterparts52. In addition, older workers tend to take more time off work for injury recuperation53. The most common age groups for accidents in the construction industry are between the ages of 25 and 29 years, indicating the effect of experience on construction industry cases due to the unique nature of the industry. Workers older than 55 years’ experience a lower injury rate of 7% but a higher incidence of upper extremity complaints at 47% compared to those under 20 years of age, who have higher injury rates at 20.1% but fewer complaints at 13%54. Research indicates that as individuals age, their body composition and weight often shift, increasing their vulnerability to health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension while also impacting flexibility and mobility55.

The GOSI has provided historical records of construction industry accidents in KSA, revealing a varied distribution of accidents across the days of the week (Fig.4). Saturdays recorded the highest number of accidents (43,462), followed closely by Sundays (42,881) and Tuesdays (42,750). Mondays and Wednesdays also showed significant numbers, with 42,216 and 41,571 accidents, respectively. However, Thursdays reported a slightly lower count of 36,920, and Fridays recorded a significantly lower number of accidents, at only 6730, likely due to Friday being a non-working day in the construction sector. The data shows that accidents take place across all days of the week, but Friday has a much lower incidence rate, which corresponds to its role as a rest day. In contrast, accident rates from Saturday to Wednesday remain relatively uniform, with no clear effect of the day on the likelihood of accidents. Thursday shows a slight decrease but still falls within the typical range observed on working days.

In KSA, the highest incidence rate of construction accidents occurs in March, with just under 25,000 accidents, constituting approximately 10.5% of the annual total, as illustrated in Fig.5. December also records a high accident frequency, with slightly over 22,000 incidents, contributing approximately 9.3% to the yearly total. Most other months show relatively stable accident rates, contributing between 8 and 9% of the annual total, with July and August displaying some of the lowest accident counts, contradicting expectations of elevated accidents during extreme summer heat. The lower accident rates in July and August might be attributed to reduced work hours during intense heat or the implementation of stricter safety measures. March and December, however, stand out as months with noticeably higher accident frequencies, possibly due to seasonal variations in construction activity or increased workloads to meet project deadlines.

The Makkah region in KSA reports the highest number of construction accidents, with 95,618 incidents, significantly exceeding the Eastern Region, which has 68,564 accidents, as shown in Fig.6. This disparity highlights the influence of higher population density, urbanization, and construction activity in Makkah, driven by its significance as a religious and tourist hub. The Riyadh region follows closely with 61,286 accidents, reflecting its status as a major urban and administrative center. In stark contrast, regions such as Al-Baha report a minimal number of accidents, with only 570 incidents, accounting for less than 0.6% of the total accidents in Makkah. Collectively, the Makkah, Eastern, and Riyadh regions account for the vast majority of construction accidents in Saudi Arabia. These three regions alone contribute to a substantial share of the total, while the remaining provinces, including Najran, Medina, and Al-Qassim, collectively account for a significantly smaller proportion.

To develop a time series model for forecasting construction accidents, the dataset was divided using a 75:25 train-test split. The training data covered the period from January 2010 to July 2017, while the remaining portion was used for testing. Figure7shows a decomposition plot that separates the time series into its core components, helping to reveal underlying patterns more clearly. The top panel (in orange) presents the raw time series of construction accident reports in KSA. Although the data shows natural fluctuations due to the variable nature of such incidents, certain recurring patterns can be observed, including periods of increase and decline in accident rates.

Decomposition of the time series for construction accidents (01/01/2011 to 30/09/2022) showing the observed data (top 1st panel), the underlying trend (2nd panel), seasonal fluctuations (3rd panel), and residual (random) component (bottom 4th panel).

The trend component highlights the long-term movement in the data by filtering out short-term and seasonal effects. It shows a general decline in accident numbers during the earlier years, continuing until around 2019. After that, a noticeable rise appears in the data. This shift may reflect a combination of factors, such as increased construction activity, changes in safety regulations, or updates in reporting practices that may have led to higher recorded incidents.

The seasonal component captures recurring patterns at regular intervals, such as monthly or yearly cycles. The data displays a clear seasonal structure, with certain months consistently showing higher accident rates than others. The random component reflects the irregular and unpredictable fluctuations that are not explained by trend or seasonality. This portion of the data captures noise from unforeseen or exceptional events in the construction industry that disrupt the usual patterns.

This decomposition plot aids in interpreting the fundamental components of construction accident data over time, which is essential for building reliable forecasting models. By separating the trend, seasonal, and random elements, the structure of the data becomes clearer, allowing time series techniques such as SARIMA, Holt-Winters, and Simple Exponential Smoothing to be applied more effectively.

Figure8presents the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for the first-differenced construction accident series56. The shaded bands show the 95% confidence limits. Differencing was applied to address the high autocorrelation in the raw series, which indicated non-stationarity. In the ACF plot (Fig.8a), significant spikes at lag 1 and lag 12 suggest short-term correlation and annual seasonality. The PACF plot (Fig.8b) shows similar spikes, which support the inclusion of AR(1), MA(1), seasonal AR(1), and seasonal MA(1) components. These patterns validate the SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) specification as suitable for capturing both short-term dependencies and yearly cycles in the data.

To test for stationarity, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was performed on the first difference of the construction accident time series57. Differencing was required due to the significant autocorrelation observed in the original, non-differenced series. The high autocorrelation rendered the non-differenced parameter unsuitable for modeling, necessitating their transformation to address non-stationarity. Table2presents the results of the ADF test for the first-differenced series. The test statistic for construction accident was − 2.86, with a lag order of 11 and ap-value of 0.048, marking the threshold of statistical significance. These findings confirm that the first-differenced series is stationary, supporting its use in the final time series model.

ADF test results for stationarity in the construction accidents time series.

The parameters of the SARIMA, Holt–Winters, and SES models used for forecasting construction accidents are summarized in Tables3and4, and5, respectively. For the SARIMA model, the configuration (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) was selected through a systematic identification process. The seasonal period m = 12 m = 12 m = 12 was set based on the monthly frequency of the data and the annual repetition observed in the decomposition plots. Results from the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test indicated the need for first-order non-seasonal (d = 1d = 1d = 1) and seasonal (D = 1D = 1D = 1) differencing to achieve stationarity. Examination of the ACF and PACF plots for the differenced series showed significant spikes at lags 1 and 12, supporting the inclusion of AR(1), MA(1), seasonal AR(1), and seasonal MA(1) terms. Among various candidate specifications, this configuration achieved the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and best out-of-sample performance, enabling it to effectively capture both short-term dependencies and annual seasonality patterns in the construction accident data.

Estimated parameters for the SARIMA model used in forecasting construction accidents.

Estimated parameters for the Holt-Winters model used in forecasting construction accidents.

Estimated parameters for the SES model used in forecasting construction accidents.

The Holt-Winters model utilized an additive trend and seasonality framework. The optimized smoothing level (α = 0.2818) indicated moderate smoothing of the data level, while the trend smoothing parameter (β = 0.0421) showed a gradual adjustment to the underlying trend. The seasonal smoothing parameter (γ = 0.7046) reflected a strong seasonal effect. The seasonal period was set to 12, consistent with monthly seasonality in the data. This configuration enabled the model to adapt to both trend and seasonal fluctuations. Furthermore, SES model was also used in which the optimized smoothing level parameter was α = 0.3401, indicating moderate smoothing of the level component. Since SES does not account for trend or seasonal effects, other parameters such as smoothing slope, smoothing seasonality, and seasonal period were not applicable.

Furthermore, Figs.9,10and11present the forecast of construction accidents in KSA using three different time series models including SARIMA (1,1,1)(1,1,1,12), Holt-Winters, and SES. In each of these plots, the black line represents the observed training data from 2011 to 2019, showing the actual number of construction accidents that occurred during that period. The red line represents the actual test data from 2020 to 2022, which is used to evaluate the forecasts of models. The green line shows the rolling forecast generated by each model during the test period, based on the historical training data. Similarly, the gray shaded area highlights the test period (2020–2022), and the blue shaded area marks the COVID-19 lockdown period from March 26, 2020, to June 21, 2020, a time when strict lockdown measures were implemented in KSA58.

Forecast of construction accidents in KSA using the SARIMA (1,1,1)(1,1,1,12) model.

Holt-Winters-based forecast of construction accidents in KSA.

Figure9shows that SARIMA model is a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model that accounts for both trend and seasonality in the data. The model successfully captures the declining trend in accidents from 2011 to 2018 and correctly forecasts the seasonal fluctuations. However, during the COVID-19 lockdown period, the SARIMA model slightly overestimates the number of accidents. This overestimation likely occurs because SARIMA, while capturing general trends and seasonality, does not incorporate external disruptions like the lockdown, which caused a significant decrease in construction activities and consequently, accidents.

The Holt-Winters model as shown in Fig.10, which includes both trend and seasonality, performs quite similarly to SARIMA but with less accuracy. This model also captures the overall trend of declining accidents but struggles with the sudden change in accident numbers during the lockdown. Like SARIMA, the forecast for the lockdown period is overestimated due to the inability of model to account for the drastic drop in construction activity during the lockdown. The model exhibits seasonal fluctuations that do not align with the actual reduction in accidents observed during the lockdown. While Holt-Winters is effective in capturing long-term trends and seasonal variations, it is less accurate during periods of significant disruption like the COVID-19 lockdown.

The SES model (Fig.11), which does not account for trend or seasonality and only relies on a smoothed average of past data, provides the least accurate forecast. SES is a simpler model and, as expected, it performs poorly during the COVID-19 lockdown. The forecast during the lockdown period is significantly overestimated, as SES does not adjust for the sudden change in the construction environment brought on by the lockdown. While the SES forecast aligns with the observed data post-lockdown, it proves less reliable during the disrupted period when accident numbers dropped sharply due to the cessation of most construction activities. Among these models, SARIMA performed better as it aligns with the observed data more closely in the pre-lockdown period and forecasts the overall trend and seasonality better than the other models. For further assessment, Tables6and7show the performance measures of each model and summary statistics of optimal SARIMA model.

Performance comparison of different time series models for forecasting construction accidents.

Summary statistics obtained from the SARIMA model.

The results in Table7for the SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) model, which forecasts construction accidents in KSA, provide important insight into the components that influence accident trends. The model includes both non-seasonal and seasonal parameters and captures the trend, seasonality, and short-term shifts in the data. The AR (Lag 1) coefficient is – 0.2867 with a p-value of 0.107, which shows that the autoregressive term does not reach statistical significance at the 0.05 level. This points to a weak inverse link between the previous and current accident values. Although not statistically strong, this term may still help to account for subtle temporal effects and improve residual behavior.

By contrast, the MA (Lag 1) coefficient is -0.5247 with ap-value of 0.001, which confirms its clear and significant influence. The negative value indicates that a positive deviation in the previous period tends to result in fewer accidents in the current one. This reflects short-term corrections in the error structure. The Seasonal AR (Lag 12) coefficient stands at 0.7511 with ap-value of 0.113, which indicates a positive, though statistically weak, association with accident counts from the same month in the prior year. Its inclusion remains reasonable due to the visible yearly cycle in the data and expert understanding of seasonal effects. On the other hand, the Seasonal MA (Lag 12) coefficient is -0.9996 with ap-value of 0.993 and a very large standard error, which shows no practical value in the model.

Figure12presents the outcome of the residual analysis for the optimal SARIMA model. The top panel displays the residuals over time, which appear to lack any discernible trend. This indicates that the SARIMA model has effectively accounted for the primary patterns within the data, including both seasonal fluctuations and underlying trends. However, there are a few spikes around early 2022, which indicate moments where the forecasts of the SARIMA model significantly deviated from the observed values. This might be due to the occasional outliers or events not accounted for by the model.The QQ plot in the middle panel assesses the normality of the residuals. While most points lie along the red reference line, indicating approximate normality, there are slight deviations at both tails. This shows that the residuals have heavier tails than a normal distribution, meaning that the model occasionally underestimates or overestimates the actual values more than what would be expected under a normal error distribution. The ACF plot in the bottom panel checks for patterns in the residuals. Most of the autocorrelation fall within the confidence intervals (blue shaded region), indicating that the residuals are largely uncorrelated. This implies that the model has adequately captured the dependencies in the data. However, slight autocorrelation at lower lags might illustrate that there are small unexplained patterns left in the residuals.

The analysis of construction accidents in KSA using time series models revealed several critical insights that align with and expand upon the existing body of literature. Unlike prior studies in Saudi Arabia that focus on descriptive accident statistics, this study applies seasonal-trend time series modeling to over a decade of construction accident data. The approach captures both short-term and annual patterns, quantifies the impact of COVID-19 lockdown and produces forward-looking forecasts, providing a data-driven basis for proactive safety planning.

Firstly, the distribution of accidents by type, age group, and region highlights systemic challenges in ensuring safety across the construction sector. The predominance of falls, abrasions, and incidents involving being struck by objects aligns with previous studies emphasizing the hazardous nature of elevated workspaces and inadequate safety measures59,60. The findings reveal a clear need for focused measures in high-risk activities. The age-related trends, with the highest accident frequency recorded among workers aged 30–35, indicate a link between physical demands and job responsibilities within this group. This pattern aligns with prior research, which shows that younger workers tend to face higher injury rates due to limited experience, while older workers are more likely to suffer severe injuries and require extended recovery periods51,52. The implications are twofold i.e., improving training for younger workers and implementing ergonomic interventions for older ones. In our study, we assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown period on construction. This is in line with similar studies conducted on the effect of COVID-19 on construction safety in the Chinese and US construction sectors, which also highlight the disruptions and challenges faced during the pandemic61. In the context of time series modeling, comparative performance measures indicate that while SARIMA effectively modeled accident trends, Holt-Winters struggled with abrupt changes, and SES was limited by its inability to account for trend or seasonality. These results align with prior applications of SARIMA in other contexts, where it has been favored for its adaptability to complex temporal patterns45,46.

The construction sector in KSA presents considerable safety challenges, necessitating dependable forecasting methodologies to support strategic planning. This study utilized monthly construction accident data from January 2011 to September 2022 to evaluate the forecasting capabilities of three time series models including Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES). Among the evaluated models, SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) exhibited the most favorable performance metrics, with ME = 26.5, MAE = 74.75, MSE = 10,758.94, and RMSE = 103.77. The model successfully represented both trend and seasonal structures inherent in the accident data. A marked reduction in accident frequency during the COVID-19 lockdown period further demonstrated the sensitivity of the model to structural breaks in the time series.

While the SARIMA model demonstrates strong forecasting performance, it requires relatively higher computational resources compared to simpler alternatives such as SES. This may limit its applicability in real-time systems or environments with constrained processing capabilities. Furthermore, the dataset employed in this study, although reliable in terms of temporal coverage, does not include disaggregated variables such as safety training records, equipment usage, worker fatigue levels, or environmental conditions at construction sites. The absence of such factors may restrict the ability to identify causal drivers behind construction accident trends and limits the explanatory scope of the proposed model.

Based on the results and observations drawn from this study, several practical actions are suggested. For policymakers, it is necessary to introduce mandatory, centralized reporting systems that maintain detailed records on safety training, equipment specifications, inspection outcomes, and site-level compliance. A more structured data environment will allow the application of reliable forecasting models and promote greater accountability within the construction sector. Similarly, forecasting framework should be integrated into safety planning processes. This framework can inform early-warning systems and guide scheduling and resourcing decisions. In future research, forecasting frameworks should consider the inclusion of exogenous variables such as economic indicators, regulatory developments, and weather conditions. The use of hybrid approaches that combine statistical models with machine learning techniques, or the development of multivariate time series models, may improve predictive accuracy.
