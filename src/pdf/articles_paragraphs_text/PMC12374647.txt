Migraine, a major headache disorder of high prevalence, affects approximately one billion individuals globally and imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden. Acupuncture, as a modality of complementary and alternative medicine, is increasingly used by patients for migraine management. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of acupuncture in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for this condition remains a subject of debate. The varying non-specific effects of different sham acupuncture (SA) techniques complicate the accurate assessment of true therapeutic effectiveness of acupuncture. This protocol details a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed at comprehensively evaluating both the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with various sham controls and the differential non-specific effects of different SA methods in migraine. Our aims involve: (1) evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture relative to SA controls in migraine treatment; (2) comparing the effect sizes across different SA methods and (3) identifying potential factors that influence the outcomes associated with various sham interventions.

We will undertake a thorough investigation using multiple databases, including Wanfang Data, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, Chongqing VIP Database, SinoMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese Clinical Trial Register, International Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Registry and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, spanning from their initial records up to 12 November 2024. The inclusion criteria are RCTs that compare acupuncture with SA controls for migraine treatment. Studies with waiting-list or no-treatment controls will be included only if they also contain an SA arm. Studies focusing exclusively on chronic migraine patients (≥15 headache days per month) will be excluded. Two independent reviewers will perform study selection, data extraction using a standardised prepiloted form and risk of bias assessment. The primary outcome will be the standardised mean difference (SMD) in migraine frequency measures, allowing for the inclusion of various frequency metrics (eg, migraine attacks, migraine days, headache days). Secondary outcomes will include response rate (≥50% reduction in frequency), days with acute medication use, the number of migraine days per month, pain intensity (measured using tools such as the Visual Analogue Scale or Numeric Rating Scale), and scores from migraine-specific questionnaires, among others. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 (RoB 2) will be employed for bias assessment, along with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis online tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. A frequentist NMA will be executed using Stata (V.18.0). The network structure will comprise: acupuncture as a single node (or multiple nodes if heterogeneity warrants), different SA methods as separate nodes, and waiting-list/no-treatment as a single node. In terms of continuous outcomes, the synthesis will be conducted using the SMD with a 95% CI for estimating effects. Heterogeneity, network inconsistency and potential publication bias will be scrutinised. As needed, meta-regression, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be executed.

Since this research is based on data from published sources, it does not necessitate formal ethical clearance. The results will be shared via articles in scholarly journals and during presentations at academic symposiums.

By employing a network meta-analysis, this study methodically evaluates both the true effectiveness of acupuncture and the relative non-specific effects of diverse sham acupuncture controls in migraine prophylaxis trials.

Rigorous systematic review methodologies are used, incorporating comprehensive search strategies and independent dual data extraction. This is facilitated by the use of standardised, prepiloted forms, which enhance the accuracy of the data and the reliability of the study.

The network structure allows for both direct and indirect comparisons, providing a comprehensive evaluation of different sham methods even when direct head-to-head comparisons are limited.

The inherent heterogeneity among the categorised sham interventions, attributable to variations in procedural specifics across studies, may impair the precision of the comparative effectiveness estimates between different types of sham controls.

Potential confounding variables include the inclusion of mixed episodic and chronic migraine populations in some studies, variability in the diagnostic criteria for migraine that have been used historically, language limitations in the scope of the literature search, and the subjective nature and residual impact of varying study quality, despite thorough risk of bias assessments.

Despite these guideline endorsements, RCTs examining the specific efficacy of acupuncture for migraine prevention present mixed results. While systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated effectiveness of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture (SA), individual trial results vary considerably.7 8For instance, during the same 1–4-week treatment period, a 2017 trial highlighted a significant reduction in migraine frequency, favouring acupuncture over SA.9However, a 2020 RCT published inThe BMJindicated that, during the treatment phase, the average number of migraine days and attacks did not significantly differ between the real and SA groups.10This variability may be partly explained by the heterogeneous nature of SA interventions used across studies.

In this context, a network meta-analysis (NMA) that methodically compares the differences between multiple SA methods and acupuncture itself emerges as an optimal strategy to elucidate these effect discrepancies. Common SA methods encompass superficial needling at acupoints, needling at non-acupoints and the use of non-penetrating SA devices. Superficial needling typically involves minimal stimulation, with needle insertion depths ranging from 3 to 5 mm and an avoidance of elicitingdeqi—a sensation often associated with effective acupuncture. This method, while categorisable under broader terms such as ‘direct needling’ or ‘floating needling’, still retains a potential therapeutic impact. Needling at non-acupoints entails inserting needles at locations not recognised as traditional acupoints, often chosen to be 5 mm to 3 cm away from recognised acupoints or situated between meridians. Non-penetrating SA employs specialised devices designed to avoid skin penetration, thus minimising invasive stimulation. However, the perpendicular application of these devices to the skin limits their suitability for simulating specialised needling techniques, such as flat or oblique needling. The inherent differences in the application of various SA methods potentially lead to differential effects, which could significantly influence the interpretation of RCT outcomes.

To date, research has predominantly focused on direct comparisons between acupuncture and SA, without systematically addressing the differential influences exerted by various sham techniques. This oversight impedes a precise evaluation of acupuncture’s effectiveness.26By simultaneously evaluating both the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with various sham controls and the differential non-specific effects of different sham methods, employing an NMA, this study aims to delineate different sham methods’ influences in migraine treatment and to assess the comparative effectiveness of acupuncture vs SA. This approach seeks to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in the relief of migraines more precisely. Furthermore, it will systematically investigate the key factors that contribute to the varying effects of sham methods, thereby elucidating the sham effect and delivering essential evidence for discerning the overall acupuncture effect’s non-specific and specific components. In this study, we aim at: (1) evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture relative to SA controls in migraine treatment; (2) comparing the magnitude of effects among diverse SA techniques and (3) investigating potential factors influencing the observed effects of different sham interventions.

This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines and the reporting checklist for NMA.27Registration number CRD42024620550 marks the official listing of our protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, which can be accessed athttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/. We plan to initiate the study on 1 September 2025. The search strategy will cover all publications available online from database inception to 12 November 2024, with the possibility of extending this timeframe to include additional studies if necessary. Data extraction and analysis are scheduled for completion by November 2025, and the entire project is anticipated to be finalised by 28 February 2026.

The present study will exclusively encompass RCTs that compare acupuncture with SA in migraine treatment. RCTs with waiting-list or no-treatment control groups will be included only if they also contain a SA arm to enable network connections. Only studies published in English or Chinese will be considered. Studies focusing exclusively or predominantly (>50%) on chronic migraine patients will be excluded due to different sample characteristics. Exclusions will apply to studies utilising a crossover design, as well as to published study protocols, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and animal studies.

Participants will include patients diagnosed with migraine based on established criteria, such as the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria by the International Headache Society. There will be no restrictions based on age or sex. Studies involving patients with significant neurological conditions (eg, subarachnoid haemorrhage, cerebral infarction) or secondary headaches will be excluded. Studies including mixed populations of episodic and chronic migraine will be included if chronic migraine patients constitute ≤50% of the sample.

Acupuncture is the targeted insertion of needles at certain body points and includes various techniques such as scalp acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, electroacupuncture, manual acupuncture, dry needling and warm needling. Studies employing acupuncture-like techniques with the exception of needle insertion (eg, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, laser acupuncture, acupressure) will be excluded. If acupuncture is combined with other treatments (eg, medication, moxibustion, cupping), these cointerventions must be administered equally to both the experimental and comparator groups.

Superficial needling at acupoints, regardless of depth, including minimal prick or depths of 3–5 mm.

Needling at non-acupoint locations, defined as any location not identified as an acupoint, at any depth.

Use of non-penetrating SA devices, including blunt-tipped needles and devices including Takakura, Park, Streitberger or those developed by investigators.

Needling at non-therapeutic acupoints, considered irrelevant for treating migraine, at any depth.

Sham electroacupuncture, which mirrors the setup of active electroacupuncture but without electrical stimulation.

Explicitly labelled interventions as ‘SA’ or ‘placebo acupuncture’, which may form a mixed ‘other sham’ category if specifics are insufficient for finer classification.

A waiting list or no-treatment control group, included only if reported alongside an eligible sham comparison to enable network connections.

Primary outcome measures: Standardised mean difference (SMD) in migraine frequency measures, including but not limited to: average monthly frequency of migraine attacks, average number of migraine days per month, average number of headache days per month, or days with at least moderate headache.

Secondary outcome measures: Response rate (defined as ≥50% reduction in frequency from baseline); Number of days with acute medication use per month; pain intensity scores (eg, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)) with clear specification of what is being measured (eg, worst attack pain, average pain intensity); Scores from migraine-specific questionnaires (eg, Migraine Disability Assessment, Headache Impact Test-6, Migraine Treatment Assessment Questionnaire (MTAQ)) and Description of adverse events associated with the interventions.

We will conduct a comprehensive search of the following electronic databases from their inception to 12 November 2024: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP and SinoMed. Search terms will encompass “migraine”, “migraine with aura”, “migraine without aura”, “acupuncture”, “acupuncture treatment”, “electroacupuncture”, among other pertinent keywords. The search strategy, devised by two seasoned researchers (YL and MZ) and refined by an information specialist (FJ), will integrate six key elements: translation of the research question, use of Boolean and proximity operators, application of subject headings, text word searches, attention to spelling/grammar and jargon, and the implementation of limits and filters.30While the syntax may be adapted for meeting each database’s requirement, the underlying vocabulary and logic will remain consistent (online supplemental appendix 1).

Additionally, we will search trial registries such as the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, International Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials. To minimise publication bias, we will also review academic papers, conference proceedings and grey literature. Through Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com) and Baidu Scholar (https://xueshu.baidu.com), we will carry out a manual search to identify any RCTs that may have been overlooked during the database searches.

General characteristics: Gender ratio among patients, sample size, country of origin, year of publication, first author, average age of patients, average duration of the disease, average duration of treatment, follow-up period, criteria used for diagnosing migraines.

Intervention characteristics: Techniques of acupuncture (eg, manual, electroacupuncture, auricular, scalp, dry needling, warm needling); adjunctive interventions (eg, moxibustion, cupping, pharmacotherapy); frequency of needling; depth of needle insertion; duration of each needling session; patient responses to needling (eg,deqi, muscle twitch).

Methods of SA; adjunctive interventions in the control group; frequency and duration of sham procedures; needling response (eg,deqi, muscle twitch); depth of sham needle insertion and selection methods for sham points; type of non-penetrating sham device used; information provided to patients by practitioners regarding the sham procedure. If a waiting-list or no-treatment control group is present, its characteristics or any interventions employed during the waiting period will also be documented.

To address issues of unclear or absent data, communications will be initiated with the original authors to seek clarification. In cases where the required information remains unavailable, studies will be potentially excluded from specific analyses.

Quality assessments, using tools such as RoB 2, Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), will be conducted independently by two reviewers, QL and JY. In instances of disagreement, resolution will be sought through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer, FJ.

Bias from variations in how the intervention was applied.

Each domain will be scrutinised through a series of signalling questions and categorised as ‘high risk’, ‘some concerns’ or ‘low risk’. An overall risk of bias rating will be assigned; studies will be deemed low risk only if every domain pertains to ‘low risk’. Conversely, if any domain of a study is evaluated as ‘high risk’ or if ‘some concerns’ are noted in various domains, the study will be designated as having a high risk of bias, significantly eroding faith in the findings.33We acknowledge that comparisons of acupuncture versus sham typically have lower risk of performance bias due to participant blinding, while comparisons involving waiting-list controls inherently have higher risk due to lack of blinding.

The quality of evidence across studies will be assessed using the GRADE methodology. GRADE evaluates five domains that may downgrade the quality of evidence: publication bias, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency and study limitations.37The quality of evidence will be categorised as ‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’, or ‘very low’.38A ‘high’ quality rating suggests a high level of confidence that the effect estimates are close to the true effect, whereas a ‘very low’ quality rating indicates very limited confidence in the effect estimates.

An NMA will be conducted using Stata V.18.0. This analysis will integrate data from trials involving acupuncture, SA and waiting-list control groups, contingent on their availability. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using SMD to accommodate different frequency measurement scales used across studies. These analyses will include their respective SDs. Dichotomous outcomes, including adverse event incidence and response rates, are expressed in terms of ORs. Through restricted maximum likelihood methods, a random-effects NMA model is estimated to accommodate interstudy variability. This approach will facilitate the calculation of pooled estimates with 95% CIs.39The initial network structure will include: acupuncture (as a single node unless substantial heterogeneity suggests otherwise), while each SA technique will be represented as a distinct node based on predefined operational and mechanistic criteria, and waiting-list/no-treatment controls as a single node when available. If certain sham methods are underrepresented (eg, <3 studies), they may be merged with the most mechanistically similar category to maintain network connectivity and analytical stability. All node-merging decisions will be prespecified and subjected to sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact on network estimates. Detailed rationale for node selection and possible node modifications will be reported in supplementary materials, following international NMA reporting guidelines. Furthermore, cumulative ranking curves, assessed through the surface under the cumulative ranking, will be generated to evaluate and rank the relative efficacy of the interventions.

Should the number of included studies exceed ten, funnel plots will be used for exploring possible publication bias and the influence of small-study effects.40In instances of observed funnel plot asymmetry, Egger’s test will be employed for formally evaluating publication bias presence.

Should sufficient data be available, exploratory meta-regression (eg, examining variables such as total sessions, patient age, intervention depth, proportion of chronic migraine patients and blinding procedures) along with prespecified subgroup analyses (categorising by acupuncture type, sham intervention, migraine classification and the requirement fordeqisensation) will proceed for exploring possible heterogeneity sources.

To evaluate the robustness of our findings, exploratory sensitivity analyses will be undertaken. These analyses will involve the exclusion of studies based on the type of sham control used, specifically: (1) studies using superficial needling at specific acupoints; (2) studies that employ needling at non-acupoints; (3) studies that use non-penetrating SA devices; (4) studies that create their own SA devices and (5) studies using different frequency measures in the primary outcome analysis. Additionally, we will conduct a subgroup analysis based on whether the studies clearly defined what was being measured with the VAS and NRS (eg, ‘average pain intensity’ vs ‘worst pain’).

Since this research is based entirely on data from earlier publications, there is no need for formal ethical clearance. The findings will be shared by publishing them in a scholarly journal and presenting them at academic conferences.

Migraine represents a substantial public health challenge globally, significantly impairing social functioning and diminishing the quality of life of those affected.45While pharmacological treatments are commonly prescribed, their potential side effects frequently lead individuals to explore CAM options, such as acupuncture. Acupuncture, a practice rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for hundreds of years to alleviate migraine symptoms. Nonetheless, the debate continues regarding its efficacy compared with SA, largely due to the variety of sham techniques and a lack of comprehensive evaluations of their effects. This protocol outlines an NMA for systematically assessing the non-specific effects associated with various SA techniques in migraine treatment and their impact on estimating acupuncture’s true effectiveness. By making this detailed protocol public, we intend to make our research process and objectives more transparent.

Despite the abundance of RCTs investigating acupuncture for migraine, the results remain inconsistent. Existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated acupuncture’s effectiveness but have generally treated all sham methods as equivalent.7 8Additionally, studies comparing SA with other placebo interventions have shown that SA often produces larger non-specific effects.24 25This study aims to systematically gather RCTs that compare acupuncture against SA in migraine treatment. NMA will be employed to synthesise both direct and indirect evidence from these studies within a unified analytical framework. By using standardised instruments for risk of bias assessment and evidence certainty evaluation, we aim to categorise and scrutinise the quality and trustworthiness of studies. This comprehensive approach will not only allow for the quantification of acupuncture’s effect on outcomes such as the frequency of attacks and pain intensity but will also provide a more objective assessment of potential biases arising from sample variability and varying study quality. By distinguishing between different sham methods, we can more accurately estimate both the specific effects of acupuncture and the non-specific effects of various control procedures. The outcomes of this study could potentially influence the design of future RCTs on acupuncture for migraine by enabling researchers to differentiate among various sham methods. This will allow for the selection of sham controls that minimise physiological effects while maximising blinding integrity, thereby strengthening the evidence base for acupuncture as a preventive and therapeutic intervention in migraine management.

Although SA is commonly employed as a placebo control in acupuncture research, the methodologies vary considerably in terms of stimulation depth, location, procedure and the subjective experiences of patients. These variations have the potential to elicit differing physiological or psychological responses. Historically, research has often treated various sham methods as equivalent, thereby neglecting their intrinsic heterogeneity. This study harnesses the capabilities of NMA to compare multiple SA methods, aiming to quantify the impact of these differences on clinical outcomes in migraine treatment. Should significant disparities arise among the sham methods in terms of reducing headache days or pain scores, such findings would underscore the diversity and uncertainty prevalent in current sham control designs in RCTs. This insight would equip researchers and clinicians with a more nuanced understanding of non-specific effects, thereby facilitating the selection of appropriate control methods in future RCTs, avoiding the use of overly potent sham controls and enhancing the rigour and comparability of experimental results. This endeavour contributes to a more precise evaluation of acupuncture’s specific therapeutic effect beyond non-specific effects, thereby addressing longstanding academic debates.

Building on the identification of the effects of various sham types, this study will employ meta-regression, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis to examine the main influences on non-specific effects’ level, such as needling depth, point selection method, the emphasis on the sensation ofdeqiand the duration and frequency of treatment sessions. Unveiling which details of the intervention are particularly susceptible to non-specific effects could help resolve inconsistencies observed in previous research findings. By elucidating these critical variables, we aim to provide evidence that supports the design of more rational control interventions in acupuncture research, potentially establishing a more reliable evidence base for clinicians who opt for acupuncture therapy.

This study offers notable strengths. First, this study addresses a gap in existing research by initiating the first detailed assessment of differing SA methods’ effects on migraine outcomes through NMA while simultaneously evaluating effectiveness of acupuncture against these varied controls. Second, we are committed to maintaining high standards of rigour in our procedures: our search strategy has been reviewed by experts for thoroughness and accuracy, and we have implemented a dual-review process for selecting studies and extracting data using standardised, pilot-tested forms to ensure reliability and accuracy of the information gathered. Third, the network structure enables both direct and indirect comparisons, maximising the use of available evidence even when direct comparisons between sham methods are limited. Additionally, our study uses internationally recognised, advanced assessment tools such as RoB 2, CINeMA and GRADE, and we will provide detailed reporting on our evaluation methods, processes and findings, thereby enhancing the rigour and trustworthiness of the NMA results.

However, we also recognise several potential limitations. First, despite categorising SA as superficial needling at acupoints, needling at non-acupoints, or using non-penetrating sham devices, notable heterogeneity remains within these categories. The systematic review of available trials will determine whether node definitions need refinement based on the actual interventions used. For example, the term ‘superficial needling’ varies in its implementation across studies, affecting the consistency of needle insertion depths. Additionally, ‘non-acupoints’ are variously defined, either as points a specific distance from true acupoints or as areas between meridians or near certain anatomical landmarks. Moreover, non-penetrating devices, such as those with blunt-tipped needles or those designed by Streitberger and Park, differ significantly in their structural and operational principles. Second, the International Headache Society’s standards for diagnosing migraines have changed; thus, the studies included may employ varying criteria, potentially affecting the homogeneity of patient populations in terms of disease severity or subtype, which could introduce bias. The exclusion of studies focusing on chronic migraine and sensitivity analyses based on migraine type will help address this issue. Lastly, the literature we reviewed comes exclusively from databases in Chinese and English, and the included studies are from diverse countries and regions, which may vary in quality. Despite employing the RoB 2 tool for quality assessment, which involves some degree of subjective judgement, the impact of low-quality studies cannot be entirely ruled out.
