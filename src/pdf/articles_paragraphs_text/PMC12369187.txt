The role of women’s empowerment in reducing unmet needs for family planning (FP) has received limited attention, particularly in Tanzania. While empowerment may be key to addressing disparities in FP use, its impact on unmet FP needs remains underexplored. This study assessed the impact of women’s empowerment on unmet FP needs, using the Survey-based Women’s Empowerment (SWPER) Global Index as a measure of empowerment.

This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS). The sample consisted of 9,000 women aged 15–49 years. Descriptive statistics summarized socio-demographic characteristics and unmet FP needs. Pearson’s chi-square test assessed associations between socio-demographic variables, empowerment domains, and unmet FP needs. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyzed the relationship between women’s empowerment and unmet FP needs, controlling for individual and community-level factors. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval, using STATA version 18 for analysis.

The study found that 20.9% of women had unmet FP needs. Multilevel logistic regression revealed significant associations between women’s empowerment and unmet FP needs. High empowerment in social independence increased the likelihood of unmet FP needs by 41.9% (aOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.17–1.71), while high empowerment in decision-making reduced the odds by 17.6% (aOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96). Increasing age and prior contraceptive use decreased unmet FP needs, with women aged 45–49 being 88.8% less likely to report unmet needs (aOR = 0.112, 95% CI: 0.08–0.16). Community-level education and FP knowledge were associated with lower unmet needs (aOR = 0.799, 95% CI: 0.71–0.91; aOR = 0.385, 95% CI: 0.35–0.43). Female-headed households had higher odds of unmet needs (aOR = 1.186, 95% CI: 1.02 − 1.38).

These findings emphasize the need for integrated approaches to address unmet FP needs. Policies should focus on enhancing women’s empowerment through education, improving access to reproductive health services, and addressing socio-economic disparities. Policy makers can leverage on community-level interventions to promote FP uptake and reproductive health outcomes.

Family planning (FP) is a fundamental component of reproductive health rights that enables women to make informed decisions about their fertility, thereby promoting overall well-being and socio-economic development [1,2]. Despite widespread availability of modern contraceptive methods, unmet FP remains a significant challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries including Tanzania. Unmet need for family planning refers to women who are sexually active, wish to either space their births or limit the number of children, but are not using any modern contraceptive method [3]. The gap in access to and use of contraceptives is a critical concern, as it contributes to higher maternal and child health risks, as well as economic and social inequalities [4,5].

Globally, an estimated 73 million induced abortions take place each year. Additionally, 61% of all unintended pregnancies, and 29% of all pregnancies end in induced abortion, of which 45% are unsafe abortions [6,7]. Unsafe abortion contributes to the maternal complications that leads to maternal deaths globally [8]. Over 90% of these maternal morbidities and mortalities are recorded in low-and-middle-income countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan African region [9]. The complications of unsafe abortion could be averted with increased access and availability of family planning services, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [10]. The prevalence of unmet FP need in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at 23.7%, of which unmet need for spacing and limiting was 15.81% and 7.90% respectively [11].

Women’s empowerment has emerged as a key factor to addressing maternal health needs, including FP [12–14]. Empowerment encompasses a range of factors that affect a woman’s autonomy, access to resources, and ability to make decisions, particularly regarding reproductive health. In the context of FP, empowered women are more likely to seek out and use contraceptive methods, exercise control over their fertility, and engage in informed decision-making regarding their reproductive health [13,15]. These factors not only influence women’s ability to access and use family planning services but also affect their overall quality of life.

Despite an improvement in the availability and accessibility of FP services in Tanzania, there are still records of unmet need for FP in some parts of the country, particularly in the rural areas [5,16]. Various socio-demographic factors, including age, education, employment status, wealth, and parity, have been identified as key determinants of unmet FP needs in earlier studies [17–19]. However, the role of women’s empowerment in reducing these unmet needs has received limited attention in the literature, particularly in the Tanzanian context. Empowerment may be a crucial factor in addressing disparities in family planning use, but it has not been fully explored in terms of its impact on unmet FP needs.

This study seeks to fill this gap by assessing the effect of women’s empowerment on unmet FP needs in Tanzania, using a most recent national representative data, the 2022 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey (TDHS) and the Survey-base Women Empowerment Global [20].

This study will provide insight into how improved women’s empowerment can contribute to increased contraceptive use and reduced unmet needs for FP. Additionally, the study will explore the role of individual and community-level factors that may influence this relationship. This would offer a comprehensive understanding of the socio-cultural and structural determinants of unmet family planning needs in Tanzania. The use of a comprehensive women empowerment measure and the multilevel consideration of factors that can potentially influence FP uptake in Tanzania presents as an advantage over earlier studies in the jurisdiction.

The findings from this study could inform policy and intervention strategies aimed at enhancing women’s empowerment, improving family planning access, and ultimately contributing to better reproductive health outcomes for women in Tanzania.

This research employed a cross-sectional design, using secondary data from the most recent 2022 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey (TDHS) dataset. The Demographic Health Survey (DHS) is nationally representative carried out every five years in over 85 low- and middle-income countries globally [21]. Participants in the survey are selected through a multistage sampling process. The methodology employed in the 2022 TDHS is present athttps://www.dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr382-dhs-final-reports.cfm?cssearch=1811439_1[21].

A total of 15,254 eligible women age 15–49 years from 15,705 households were successfully interviewed. The survey had a response rate of 97%. For the purpose of this study, only women who were married or cohabiting were included. This was because the Survey-based Women Empowerment (SWPER) Global required primarily women who were cohabitting or married to create the empowerment scale [22]. This brought the final sample size for the study to 9000 women age 15–49 years.

The detail description of the methodology used for the 2022 TDHS is freely available in the DHS website (https://www.dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-FR382-DHS-Final-Reports.cfm) [21]. Figure1shows a summary of the sampling process in a flow chart.

This study’s data is obtained from the responses in the woman’s questionnaire. The Woman’s questionnaire or also called the individual questionnaire collected data on maternal and child health issues, including but not limited to background characteristics (age, marital status, education, exposure to media, etc.), child birth and mortality history, family planning use and knoweldge, etc.

Social Independence: Access to information (frequency of reading newspapers or magazines), Educational attainment, Age at marriage, Age at first child, Differences in age and education between the woman and her cohabiting partner.

Decision-Making: Who makes decisions in the household on large purchases, Who makes decisions about the woman’s health care, Who makes decisions about visits to family or relatives, and Whether the woman worked in the previous year.

Attitudes to Violence: Woman’s opinion on whether a husband is justified in beating his wife in specific situations (e.g., leaving the house without telling the husband, neglecting the children).

These variables are combined using principal component analysis (PCA) to create the SWPER Global Index.

Unmet Need for Spacing: This refers to fertile women who wish to space their births but are not currently using any modern contraceptive methods.

Unmet Need for Limiting Births: This pertains to fertile women who do not desire any more children but are not using any modern contraceptive methods.

The primary outcome variable for this study is the unmet need for FP, (coded as 0 = no unmet for FP and 1 = unmet for FP), which includes both the unmet needs for spacing or need for limiting births. This outcome variable is not directly listed in the DHS dataset. It was obtained by recoding of data on family planning use among the women. The recoding process is available athttps://github.com/DHSProgram/DHS-Indicators-Stata/tree/master/Chap07_FP.

Attitude Towards Violence: This domain evaluates a woman’s opinion on whether a husband is justified in beating his wife in specific situations.

Social Independence: This domain assesses a woman’s access to information, attainment of a desirable educational level, age at marriage and first childbirth, and the differences in age and education between the woman and her cohabiting partner.

Decision Making: This domain measures who makes decisions in the household and whether the woman is employed.

Women are categorized into low, medium, and high empowerment levels based on the cutoff points defined in the SWPER Global methodology. The comprehensive design of this index is detailed by Ewerling and colleagues. The STATA do-file for calculating the SWPER index is available athttps://goo.gl/isGonn[22].

The study also included covariates that is used to control for the primary explanatory variables. These covariates are obtained are significant variables associated with unmet needs for FP in previous studies [4,25–30]. These variables were categorized into individual level variables and community level factors. Some of the community level variables we aggregated individual responses within each cluster, or “community,” and used the average response for categorization [31].

Educational attainment (community level): The average number of years of education among women in the cluster was calculated. Women living in clusters above the national mean were coded as “high education community” and those below as “low education community”.

Wealth index (community level): Using the DHS wealth quintile scale (1 = poorest to 5 = richest), we computed the average wealth index per cluster. Communities with a mean index ≥ 3 (middle or above) were classified as “high wealth”; <3 were “low wealth”.

Knowledge of family planning (FP): Proportion of women in a cluster who knew at least one modern contraceptive method. Clusters with ≥ 50% of women reporting FP knowledge were classified as “high knowledge”.

Exposure to FP messages: Defined by the proportion of women in the cluster who reported exposure to family planning messages via radio, newspapers, or any media. Communities with ≥ 50% were labeled “high exposure”.

All thresholds (e.g., national mean, ≥ 50% cut-off) were selected based on literature precedence and practical distributional cut-points in DHS-based studies [31].

For instance, suppose in one cluster, the average years of education is 8 years. If a woman’s education level is below 8 years, she is coded as part of a “low-education” community. If her education level is 8 years or higher, she is coded as part of a “high-education” community. Again, let’s say the average wealth index in a community is 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 5, where a lower score indicates lower poverty. If a woman’s wealth index is 2.6 or higher, she is in a “high wealth” community. If her index is below 2.5 or lower, she falls into a “low-wealth” community.

Table1shows each of the study variables and how they are coding.

To guide our model specification and clarify hypothesized relationships, we developed a conceptual model (Fig.2). This figure represents our theoretical assumptions regarding the directionality and potential confounding or mediating relationships among variables influencing unmet need for family planning.

The data for this study was downloaded in STATA statistical analysis format and the data analysis performed in four stages using STATA version 18 statistical software, with sampling weights from the DHS data applied to adjust for the sampling design.

In this first stage, we generated a descriptive summary of the variables, including frequency distributions for the sociodemographic characteristics of the women, the unmet needs for FP and SWPER domains.

In the second stage of the analysis, Pearson’s chi-test was used to test for association between unmet needs for FP and the primary explanatory variables and covariates. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

In the third stage of the analysis, explanatory variables, which were statistical significantly associated with unmet needs for FP, were included in a regression model to test for multicollinearity using variance inflation factor (VIF). Variables found with vif of 5 or more were excluded from the next stage of the analysis [32].

In the final stage of the analysis, a mixed-multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify women empowerment and its association unmet needs for FP. Five regression models were created. The first model (null model) was fitted without explanatory variables to test the random variability in the intercept and show the total variance in the unmet needs for FP among women in different communities. The second model (Model I) fitted women empowerment domains to test the effect of women empowerment on unmet needs for FP. In the third model (Model II), the individual-level factors were also fitted to examine their effect on unmet needs for FP. The Model III examined the effect of community-level factors on unmet needs for FP. The final model (Model IV) examined the combined effect of all statistically significant (p< 0.20) explanatory variables in the preceding models on unmet needs for FP among the women.

Fixed-effect results were reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was calculated for each model to quantify the proportion of variation attributable to higher-level clustering and to facilitate comparisons between models.

In the analysis, the ’svy’ command in STATA was used to allow for adjustments for the cluster-sampling design of the data collection and weights. This was also done to account for selection bias in the study. The “melogit” STATA command was also used for the logistic regression, “estat icc” for the intra-class correlations and “estat ic” for the information criterions (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)).

The data were cleaned by checking and correcting all inconsistencies and discrepancies. Also, missing data were handled by STATA’s default listwise deletion method.

The data used in this study were secondary and publicly accessible, therefore individual consent was not required by the ICF International Institutional Review Board. This study proceeded with the necessary permissions from the DHS Program, and all data were carefully managed to ensure privacy during the processing and analysis stages of the study.

About 15.55% of women have an unmet need for family planning for spacing births. In total, 20.94% of women have unmet family planning needs for either spacing or limiting birth but are not using any contraceptive method (Fig.3).

The largest age group (25–29 years) constitutes 20.46%, while the youngest (15–19 years) makes up 6.1%. Most women (58.4%) have only primary education, and education level strongly correlates with unmet family planning (FP) needs (p< 0.0001), with the highest unmet need (24.9%) among those with no formal education. About 31.8% are unemployed, while 26.3% engage in manual labor. Although 97.9% are aware of contraceptives, 39.8% have never used any. Just over half (51.6%) have heard FP messages on the radio. Wealth distribution shows 18.6% in the poorest and 22.4% in the richest categories. Parity significantly affects unmet needs (p< 0.0001), with the lowest unmet need among childless women (5.2%) and the highest among those with four or more children (25.6%). Prior contraceptive use is strongly linked to unmet needs (p< 0.0001), with never-users reporting higher unmet needs (31.5%) than ever-users (13.9%).

Male-headed households show slightly lower unmet FP needs (20.4%,p= 0.036). Distance to health facilities is a “big problem” for 31.6% of respondents and significantly influences unmet needs (p= 0.011), with higher unmet needs among those facing access challenges (23% vs. 20%). Urban women have lower unmet needs (17.8%) than rural women (22.4%,p< 0.01). Most communities (80.1%) have low education levels, which correlates with higher unmet needs (22% vs. 16.7% in high-education communities,p< 0.001). Wealth disparities also play a role, with 61.9% in low-wealth communities. High community FP knowledge is linked to lower unmet needs (20.7% vs. 31.2%,p< 0.001). This is shown in Table2.

Figure3shows nearly half of the respondents (47.2%) fall into the high empowerment category within the attitude towards violence domain. However, 32.7% have low empowerment in this area. In terms of social independence, 30.5% of women exhibit high empowerment, while 43.2% show medium empowerment (Fig.2). More than half of the respondents (54.5%) had high empowerment in the decision-making domain, while 17.8% are in the low empowerment category (Fig.4).

There was no association between attitude towards violence domain and unmet need for family planning (p= 0.456). However, there was a very strong assocation between social independence domain (p< 0.0001), decision making (p< 0.0001) and unmet needs for FP. The rate of unmet needs reduced with increase level of empowerment, with women with high empowerment under social independence and decision making having lower rate of unmet needs for FP, 18.2% and 18.3%, respectively (Table3).

Several variables related to education and wealth were included at different levels (e.g., individual, partner, community), and education was also embedded in the social independence domain of the SWPER index. Multicollinearity of the independent variables were therefore tested to ascertain the fitness of the regression model. Multicollinearity was observed among community knowledge of any contraceptive (VIF = 21.18), knowledge of FP (21.16), level of community exposure to FP message (VIF = 6.08) and woman exposure to FP message (VIF = 5.47). According to literature a VIF between 5 and 10 or more shows a high level of collinearity [32]. Therefore, these variables were excluded. A new regression model testing multicollinearity showed no evidence of multicollinearity among the independent variables (mean VIF = 1.88, min = 1.01 and max = 4.39) (Table4).

Additionally, there was a reduction of AIC and BIC along the models, from 9302.09 in the null model to 8444.64, and 9316.30 to 8714.63, respectively in model IV. This indicates that model IV was more parsimonous and best explains the odds of unmets needs of FP among the women. Likewise, the log-likelihood also reduced from − 4649.05 to −4184.32, further indicating the fitness of model IV (Table5).

The ICC in the null model was 7.2%, indicating that approximately 7% of the total variation in unmet need for family planning is attributable to differences between communities. This justified the use of a multilevel mixed-effects model, as it accounts for clustering and allows us to explore both individual- and community-level determinants of unmet need. As explanatory variables were added in successive models, the ICC declined to 2.3% in the final model, suggesting that much of the between-community variation was explained by the included covariates.

Table5presents five models depicting the association between unmet needs for FP and the women empowerment domains, the individual factors and community level characteristics. The variables included in the models are variables that were significant atp< 0.05 in the chi-square test.

In controlling for individual and community level factors associated with unmet for FP, women with high empowerment in the social independence domain were 41.9% more likely to have unmet needs for FP compared to those with low empowerment (aOR = 1.419; 95% CI:1.17 − 1.71), compared to those with low empowerment. However, High empowerment in the decision making was associated with reduced the odds of unmet needs for FP by 17.6% (aOR = 0.824, 95%CI: 0.70–0.96), compared to low empowerment.

There was a consistent pattern of declining odds of unmet needs with increasing age, with women aged being 88.8% less likely to have unmet needs compared to those 15–19 years (aOR = 0.112; 95% CI:0.08 − 0.16). Additionally, women with more children had significantly higher odds of unmet FP needs. For instance, Women with 4 + children were 39.3 times more likely to report unmet needs compared to women with no children (aOR = 39.27; 95% CI:25.54 − 60.38). The findings also show that women who had ever used contraception were 70.9% significantly less likely to report unmet needs for FP compared to those who had never used it (aOR = 0.291,95% CI:0.26–0.33). Women with partners who had secondary education were significantly more likely to report unmet FP needs compared to partners with no education (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI:1.11 − 1.73). Female-headed households were significantly associated with a slight increase in unmet needs for FP compared to male-headed households (aOR = 1.186, 95% CI:1.02–1.38).

Higher educational attainment was associated with lower odds of unmet FP needs, but the results were not statistically significant. Wealthier women generally had lower odds of unmet needs for FP, but the association was not significant as well. Also, all the community level variables were not found to be signficant predictors of unmet needs for FP (Table5).

We accounted for Tanzania’s hierarchical data structure (women nested in clusters, clusters nested in regions) using random intercepts for primary sampling units (PSUs). The ICC indicated that 7.2% of variance in unmet need was attributable to community-level factors (Table6). Region-level fixed effects were tested but omitted due to collinearity with community wealth. The table also shows 25.6% of variation in unmet needs for FP could be attibuted to variations at the community level. In model I, which includes two women empowerment domains, social independence and decision making, 20.7% variation of unmet needs for FP is explained by the difference in women empowerment at the community level, whilst 6% of the variations of unmet needs is due to difference across communities. The community level variations of unmet needs for FP decreased with the fitting of individual factors (8%) and community factors (9.6%), with a reduction in clustering effects. In the final model, 7.7% of variation of unmet need for FP at the community level was explained by all the significant variables the previous models. This is shown in Table6.

Our study aimed to assess the effect of women empowerment on unmet needs for family planning among women age 15 to 49 years in Tanzania. Our use of multilevel modeling was guided by the presence of clustering in the data, as indicated by an ICC of 7.2% in the empty model. This suggests that nearly one in every fourteen units of variability in unmet need was due to contextual differences across communities. As more predictors were introduced, this variation decreased, implying that empowerment and socio-demographic factors help explain community-level disparities in FP needs. The multilevel approach thus provided a more accurate estimation of effects across both individual and structural levels.

Approximately 20.9% of women in the study reported total unmet need, with significant variations across Age, education, occupation, parity, wealth, and prior contraceptive use were strongly associated with unmet needs. Over half of the women had high empowerment in decision making and many (43.2%) of them had medium empowerment in the domain of social independence. A highly significant association exists between social independence and decision-making domains and unmet need for FP.

The SWPER index was key tool used in understanding the level of women empowerment in three key domains, attitude towards violence, social independence and decision taking. The study found a strong relationship between decision-making and social independence, as well as unmet family planning needs. Women who had high empowerment in social independence had high odds of unmet FP needs, whilst those with high empowerment in decision making had lower odds of unmet FP needs. This finding suggests that whilst the women may have more freedom to make decisions regarding their fertility, it does not necessarily translate to access to FP resources or support for reproductive health decisions. Women with greater social independence might be more aware of their reproductive rights and desires but still face practical obstacles such as lack of healthcare facilities with adequate provision of FP services. It is therefore significant to improve the availability of FP services in various health facilities, particularly in rural Tanzania.

On the other hand, high decision-making empowerment means women have control over decisions related to fertility, including the use of contraceptives. Women who are empowered in decision-making are more likely to be involved in the decisions surrounding FP and are thus more likely to seek out and use contraceptive methods. This finding corresponds with an earlier literature review [13], confirming the strong imposition of high women empowerment levels in family planning uptake. Similarly, the lower unmet need among women with strong decision-making autonomy highlights the public health value of empowerment interventions. Improving women’s decision-making capacity could reduce unmet need by up to 7–8% points, which is meaningful at a population level.

In this study, education level emerged as one of the strongest factors linked to unmet FP needs, with women who had no formal education experiencing the highest unmet needs. This aligns with other studies that show that higher education levels in women often correlate with better knowledge and access to contraceptive methods, thus reducing unmet needs for FP [11,18].

The study further found that among women with high empowerment, those who reported to have previously used contraception had lower unmet needs compared to those who had never used contraception. This suggests that women who have the knowledge and autonomy to use contraception are better able to meet their family planning needs. This finding is supported by existing studies showing that women’s empowerment can significantly increase the likelihood of contraceptive use, as empowered women tend to be more involved in decision-making related to their reproductive health [12,14].

The study findings also highlight the importance of multilevel factors, individual and community-level influences, that contribute to unmet FP needs among women. Particularly at the individual level, factors such as age, education, occupation, and parity were found to be significantly associated with unmet need for FP. For instance, women aged 25–29 had the highest proportion of unmet FP needs. This finding is consistent with other studies that suggest women in this age group may face challenges in accessing contraception, possibly due to fertility desires, socio-cultural barriers, or lack of information [19,33].

At the community-level, access to FP and the educational level of the community were also found to be significantly associated with unmet FP needs. Women in communities with higher educational attainment and better knowledge of FP had lower unmet needs, which confirms that community-based interventions targeting education and awareness can be effective in reducing unmet FP needs [34].

Although place of residence and distance to health facilities were not associated with unmet FP in the multi-level analysis of this study, unlike in previous studies [35,36], they still showed a notable impact in unmet FP needs. This finding could be attributed to the fact there is an improvement in access and availability of FP service over the years, particularly in rural Tanzania, as argued by some researchers [5,37]. However, empowerment, particularly in decision-making, can enable women to overcome these potential barriers. Empowered women are more likely to make the effort to access health services, even if they are located far from their homes. They may be more likely to utilise available resources, such as public transportation, community health workers, or mobile clinics, to mitigate both the place of residence and distance issues.

The results from this study highlight the importance of a multi-faceted approach in addressing unmet FP needs. Women empowerment through education, improving access to health services, and addressing community-level disparities in knowledge and wealth are critical strategies that can support in reducing unmet FP needs. These findings further suggest that policymakers should consider both individual empowerment and broader social factors when designing interventions to reduce unmet FP needs.

Our study’s findings have shown clear implications for Tanzania’s ongoing efforts to reduce unmet need for FP and improve reproductive health outcomes. For instance, For instance, the Tanzania National Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan (NFPCIP) 2019–2023 emphasizes the importance of increasing contraceptive uptake among underserved populations, including rural women, adolescents, and those with high parity [38]. Our findings that women with more children and limited empowerment are more likely to have unmet need directly align with these priorities. Moreover, the One Plan III (2021–2025) in Tanzania recognizes women’s autonomy and community-level education as key pillars in improving reproductive health [39]. Our study reinforces this by showing that women with high decision-making power have significantly lower unmet needs, and that communities with higher education levels are more likely to meet family planning needs. These results can inform the design of community-based interventions that simultaneously address structural barriers and empowerment deficits, particularly in rural or low-resource settings. Programs like the Community Health Workers (CHW) initiative or youth-friendly service integration could incorporate empowerment metrics as key indicators of service effectiveness.

While the SWPER Global Index has been validated across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including sub-Saharan Africa, we recognize that cultural and contextual nuances in Tanzania may influence how empowerment is experienced and reported. For instance, indicators such as decision-making or attitudes toward domestic violence may be shaped by local norms, gender expectations, or social desirability bias, which can affect how women respond to survey items. Additionally, certain domains like social independence may not fully capture empowerment in extended family systems or polygynous unions, common in some Tanzanian regions. These contextual factors may lead to measurement error or misclassification of empowerment levels, especially when applying a standardized tool across diverse settings.

The study has several strengths, including its use of a large, nationally representative sample from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey, providing generalizable findings. It also employs a comprehensive measure of women’s empowerment through the SWPER Global Index and robust multilevel statistical analysis, which accounts for both individual and community factors.

However, the study’s cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and self-reported data may introduce bias. Additionally, it does not fully explore the social and cultural barriers to family planning or include institutional populations, potentially limiting the applicability of the results. Finally, it focuses on empowerment at a specific point in time, without accounting for long-term empowerment factors. The SWPER Global Index is validated across LMICs, its application in the Tanzanian context may not fully capture local dimensions of empowerment, particularly within polygynous or extended household settings. Due to multicollinearity, we excluded several theoretically important variables (e.g., family planning knowledge and media exposure), which may have limited our ability to fully capture all relevant pathways. We retained the most conceptually and statistically robust predictors, but this tradeoff may have implications for comprehensiveness.

This study findings demonstrate that higher level of empowerment, particularly in decision making, is significantly associated with reduced with unmet FP needs. Empowered women are more likely to access and utilize contraceptive methods, and this reflects the importance of autonomy in reproductive health decision-making.

Also, while individual factors such as education, parity, occupation, and prior contraceptive use were significantly associated with unmet FP needs, community-level factors like access to FP knowledge and community education levels also played a critical role. However, distance to health facilities and place of residence, traditionally seen as barriers, were not significant in this study, suggesting improvements in FP service availability in Tanzania.

These findings highlight the need for integrated approaches to address unmet FP needs. Policies should focus on enhancing women’s empowerment through education, increasing access to reproductive health services, and addressing socio-economic disparities. Empowerment initiatives, combined with community-level interventions, can substantially improve FP uptake and reproductive health outcomes, contributing to broader gender equality and developmental goals in Tanzania.
