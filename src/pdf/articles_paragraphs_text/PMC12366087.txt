The Raeini Cashmere goat, native to Kerman Province, Iran, is renowned for its high-quality cashmere fiber, a luxury natural fiber valued for its softness, warmth, and lightweight properties in the textile industry. This breed, adapted to the region’s arid climate through long-term natural and artificial selection, supports the local agricultural economy through cashmere, meat, and milk production. This study presents the first whole-genome resequencing dataset for the Raeini Cashmere goat, providing a valuable resource for ecological, evolutionary, and population genomic studies.

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of ten individual Raeini Cashmere goats and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 2500 platform. The dataset, deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession PRJNA1090775), enables future research into genetic adaptations for cashmere production and environmental resilience, supporting breeding programs and comparative genomics.

The Raeini Cashmere goat (Capra hircus) is an important indigenous breed known for cashmere production, native to Kerman Province in Iran. This breed is highly valued for its superior cashmere fiber production trait [1]. Cashmere is a valuable natural fiber that is highly sought after in the textile industry due to its softness, warmth, and durability [2]. The Raeini breed is also known for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its ability to produce meat and milk in the region, and is one of the most economically significant livestock breeds, with a population of approximately 3,300,000 individual animals [1]. Despite its importance, the genetic mechanisms underlying its unique characteristics, such as cashmere fiber characteristics, disease resistance, and environmental adaptability, are still poorly understood.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the field of genomics, enabling researchers to explore the genetic architecture of livestock species at an unprecedented resolution [3–5]. Whole-genome resequencing (WGS) facilitates the identification of genetic markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels), which can be used to study complex traits, population structure, and evolutionary history [6].

In this study, we present the first WGS data for the Raeini Cashmere goat. This dataset aims to serve as a foundational resource for understanding the genetic diversity and functional genomics of this breed. By analyzing the genomic variants identified through WGS, we aim to uncover candidate genes and regulatory elements associated with cashmere production, disease resistance, and other economically important traits. Furthermore, this data will contribute to the broader field of caprine genomics, facilitating comparative studies with other goat breeds and enhancing our understanding of the genetic factors driving adaptation and productivity in livestock.

The availability of high-quality whole genome resequencing data for the Raeini Cashmere goat will not only advance our knowledge of its genetic makeup but also support breeding programs aimed at improving cashmere quality and yield. Additionally, this resource will enable researchers to investigate the evolutionary history of the breed and its relationship with other goat populations, providing insights into the domestication and diversification of goats in arid and semi-arid regions.

Blood samples were collected from ten individual Raeini Cashmere goats in Kerman and Hormozgan provinces, Iran, where the breed is well-adapted to hot and arid climates. Genomic DNA was extracted using the salting-out technique [7]. Genomic libraries were prepared by the sequencing facility using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free kit, and each sample was sequenced individually on the NovaSeq 2500 platform, generating paired-end reads (150 bp) with an average depth of 10X per sample.

Raw sequencing data were quality-checked using FatQC (v0.11.9), yielding an average of 606 million reads per sample with an average content of GC 43%. Adapter sequences and low-quality reads (Phred score < 20) were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.39) with default parameters, resulting in xxxx million clean reads per sample. Sequence reads were aligned to the goat reference genome (GCF_001704415.2, NCBI) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM v0.7.10), achieving an average mapping rate of 99.4% across samples.

SAM (.sam) and BAM (.bam) file formats were generated utilizing the SAMtools software, which was also employed for file viewing, sorting, and indexing [8]. To reduce the likelihood of false-positive variant detection, PCR duplicates were removed using the Picard toolkit (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).In order to enhance alignment precision, base quality score recalibration (BQSR) and local realignment around insertions and deletions (indels) were carried out with tools from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [9]. Variant calling with GATK HaplotypeCaller identified 136,541 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) across all samples. To ensure data reliability, low-quality SNPs were filtered using the following criteria: Quality by Depth (QD) > 2.0, Mapping Quality (MQ) > 40, Fisher Strand (FS) < 60.0, and ReadPosRankSum >-8.0. Additionally, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% or missingness rate > 10% were excluded, resulting in 84,372 high-quality SNPs for downstream analysis. Sex chromosome X and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were retained in the dataset to provide a comprehensive genomic resource.

In finally, this study is a data note aimed at providing a high-quality whole-genome sequencing dataset for the Raeini Cashmere goat, enabling future analyses of genetic diversity, thermotolerance, immune function, and cashmere fiber traits, as well as comparisons with non-native goat populations. The whole-genome sequencing data presented in this study have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number PRJNA1090775 (https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA1090775). Detailed information and related data links can be found in Table1.

The lack of a reference genome from Iranian goat during alignment is one of the limitations of our study and similar studies. In generating this data, short-read sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 2500 platform were used, which may limit the detection of large structural variants compared to long-read sequencing technologies. Also, we produced the short-reads with a mean depth of 10X which is a medium depth and it might not be suitable for some genomic analyses.
