Uterine myomas are the most common benign tumors in the female reproductive system. The incidence of malignant transformation within a uterine myoma is low, but once it occurs, the prognosis is usually poor. The clinical symptoms of this disease are not specific, which can easily lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis of patients.

A 58-year-old married Chinese female patient had undergone annual check-ups at our hospital from 2007 to 2024, totaling 18 visits. During her initial examination in 2007, uterine fibroids were detected. She experienced natural menopause in 2010. By 2019, no significant changes were observed in the size or characteristics of the uterine fibroids. In 2020, follow-up examinations revealed an increase in the size of the fibroids, although the patient reported no significant subjective symptoms. A preliminary diagnosis of sarcomatous transformation of uterine myomas was made. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgical intervention at an alternative medical facility. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of sarcomatous transformation of uterine fibroids. As of the time of writing, she has been attending regular follow-up appointments annually since then, with the most recent visit occurring in November 2024. Currently, the patient’s overall health status remains stable, with no reported discomfort. Gynecological examinations and tumor markers (carbohydrate antigen 125 [CA125], carbohydrate antigen 199 [CA199], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], and carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]) are all within normal limits.

The malignant transformation of a uterine myoma is a rare but extremely serious complication. Timely and accurate diagnosis, followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions, is crucial for improving patient prognosis. Clinicians should maintain heightened vigilance for postmenopausal uterine fibroids that do not undergo expected regression but instead demonstrate growth.

Uterine myoma is the most prevalent benign neoplasm in the female reproductive system, typically manifesting during the reproductive years and frequently regressing or disappearing following menopause. The rate of malignant transformation in a uterine myoma is low; however, when it does occur, the prognosis is generally unfavorable [1]. The clinical presentation of this condition lacks specificity, which may result in misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Consequently, early detection and prompt treatment are critical for improving patient prognosis. We present the case of a 58-year-old female patient, who was diagnosed with uterine leiomyosarcoma during a routine physical examination. Owing to the early diagnosis, the patient’s prognosis is relatively favorable.

A 58-year-old female patient of Han ethnicity had paid 18 visits to our hospital for physical examinations during the period from 2007 to 2024. The patient first presented to our hospital for a physical examination in May 2007, during which she was diagnosed with uterine fibroids. Ultrasound imaging revealed that the fibroid was located within the myometrium of the uterus and measured 34 mm (mm) × 36 mm. The patient did not report any menstrual irregularities or signs of compression. Based on these findings, it was recommended that the patient undergo regular follow-up evaluations. From 2008 to 2010, the patient underwent annual check-ups at our hospital. During this period, the size of the uterine fibroid was found to range from 35 × 30 mm to 40 × 35 mm. The patient experienced natural menopause in 2010. In the same year, an ultrasound examination revealed a uterine fibroid measuring 40 × 41 mm. Subsequently, from 2010 to 2019, through a series of follow-up examinations, the size of the uterine fibroid was found to be largely stabilized, with minor fluctuations around 35 × 30 mm.

In November 2020, the patient returned to our hospital for a routine physical examination. She did not report any abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vaginal bleeding, or abnormal discharge. Physical examination findings were as follows: Vital signs were stable, and her mental state was good. Gynecological examination revealed an anteverted and enlarged uterus with a prominent mass on the posterior wall, measuring 50 × 60 mm, that was firm in consistency, with mild tenderness and good mobility. No abnormalities were palpated in the bilateral adnexal regions.

Routine blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 4.63 × 109/L and a hemoglobin level of 125 g/L. The levels of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were all within the normal reference ranges. Cervical ThinPrep cytologic test (TCT) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing results were both within normal limits. B-type ultrasound examination revealed an enlarged uterus with an irregular shape. An abnormal echoic mass of 63 × 45 mm was observed in the posterior wall of the uterus, with clear boundaries. There was a circular, slightly hyperechoic lesion in the interior, with clear boundaries, and the rest of the tumor was uniformly low echo. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) showed linear blood flow signals within the mass and semi-circular blood flow signals around it, with a vascular resistance index ranging from 0.52 to 0.70. No abnormalities were found in the bilateral adnexal regions. The ultrasound suggested a solid uterine mass of unknown nature, and leiomyosarcoma was considered (Fig.1). Given the rapid growth of the patient’s uterine fibroids, a preliminary diagnosis of malignant transformation was made. We recommended conducting further evaluations and formulating an appropriate treatment plan.

The patient was evaluated at an outside hospital on 2 December 2020 and subsequently underwent a total hysterectomy on 8 December 2020. Intraoperative rapid pathological examination revealed mild cellular atypia and mitosis in some tumor cells (12/10 high-power fields), with no evidence of necrosis in the sections. The initial diagnosis was a leiomyoma with significant malignant potential.

Subsequently, an extended hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy were performed. The final pathology confirmed uterine leiomyosarcoma, and the postoperative diagnosis was uterine malignant tumor (leiomyosarcoma, stage IA).

From 2021 to 2024, the patient underwent annual follow-up examinations at our hospital. The most recent examination, conducted in November 2024, revealed that both the gynecological evaluation and tumor markers were within normal limits (Table1).

Uterine myomas are the most prevalent benign tumors of the female reproductive system, with a prevalence of approximately 60–80% among women of reproductive age. Most uterine fibroids tend to gradually shrink after menopause. However, if there is an increase in size following menopause, the potential for malignant transformation should be carefully evaluated. The malignant transformation of uterine fibroids is referred to as sarcomatous change, with an incidence rate ranging from 0.4% to 0.8% [1,2].

The diagnosis of uterine fibroids is mainly based on a comprehensive assessment of medical history, physical examination results, and imaging studies. Ultrasound is the preferred auxiliary diagnostic tool for uterine fibroids because it can accurately depict the size, location, and shape of fibroids. Color Doppler ultrasound can further supplement this assessment by providing information on blood supply. Although imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable supplementary information [3,4], the final diagnosis still relies on histopathological examination. Histopathological examination remains the gold standard for differentiating sarcomatous lesions from benign fibroids.

In this case report, the patient was first diagnosed with uterine fibroids in 2007. There was no significant change observed from 2007 to 2019. During a routine physical examination in 2020, it was found that the uterine fibroids had significantly enlarged, and the possibility that there might be sarcomatous degeneration was considered. Therefore, surgical treatment was performed. On the basis of the abovementioned diagnostic methods, the patient’s condition was identified and treated in a timely manner.

The management of uterine fibroid sarcomatous degeneration is usually based on surgical resection. Depending on the stage and severity of the disease, adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also be considered [5]. It is worth noting that, compared with benign fibroids, the prognosis of patients with sarcomatous degeneration is usually poorer, so close and continuous follow-up is required. Through comprehensive treatment and regular monitoring, the patient’s condition can be better managed and the quality of life improved.

The malignant transformation of uterine fibroids is a rare but extremely serious complication. Timely and accurate diagnosis, followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions, is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding postmenopausal uterine fibroids that do not shrink but instead increase in size, particularly when accompanied by abnormal vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain, as these symptoms may indicate potential malignancy.
