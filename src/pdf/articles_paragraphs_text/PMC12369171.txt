Chronic liver disease (CLD) and complications of cirrhosis are responsible for the deaths of approximately two million people per year worldwide. Abnormal intestinal permeability in the intestinal-liver axis and development of intestinal dysbiosis increase disease progression contributing to chronic systemic inflammation in CLD patients. The intestinal microbiota acts as a bioreactor for autonomous metabolic and immunological functions in regulating the host’s response to external stimuli in the intestinal microbiota. The study aimed to analyze the gut microbiota profile from colonic mucosal biopsy materials in CLD patients using a metagenomic application.

CLD and control groups were formed based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria from the study. In the metagenomic study, colonic mucosal biopsy material was studied from a total of 40 individuals, 20 with CLD and 20 healthy controls. We analyzed gut microbiota by 16 S rRNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) method from colonic mucosal biopsy samples in CLD and healthy individuals. Metagenomic results were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Significant differences were observed between the CLD and control groups across multiple taxonomic levels. At the phylum level,Proteobacteriawere significantly enriched in CLD patients, whileFirmicutespredominated in controls. Class-level analysis showed increasedGammaproteobacteriain CLD, the former associated with inflammatory pathways. At the order level,Enterobacteraleswere significantly higher in CLD (OR: 1.89,p= 0.04), whereasClostridialeswere more abundant in controls. Family-level comparisons revealed elevatedEnterobacteriaceaein CLD, whileRuminococcaceaeandVeillonellaceaewere relatively preserved in controls. At the genus level,PrevotellaandStreptococcuswere increased in controls. Alpha diversity indices (Shannon, Chao1) were significantly lower in the CLD group (p< 0.001), indicating reduced microbial richness. Beta diversity analysis (PCoA, Bray-Curtis) showed distinct clustering between groups, supporting compositional divergence. Integration of metagenomic findings with biochemical markers (e.g., GGT: OR 0.79,p= 0.03) further underscored group-specific microbial signatures.

We observed a significant compositional shift in the gut microbiota of patients with CLD. Notably, pro-inflammatory taxa were increased and a decrease in beneficial bacterial groups involved in maintaining microbial homeostasis. Diversity analyses indicated a reduction in microbial richness in the CLD group. These findings may aid in identifying CLD-specific microbial signatures. Furthermore, integrating metagenomic data with biochemical parameters may contribute to improved diagnostic strategies.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is an important cause of death associated with fibrosis, cirrhosis, and decompensation, which is increasing worldwide [1]. The total number of CLD cases is estimated to be approximately 1.5 billion worldwide [2]. The rates of the most common etiologic causes of CLD currently vary with the effectiveness of treatment options (NAFLD (59%), HBV (29%), HCV (9%) and ALD (2%)) [3,4]. In addition, Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest complications of chronic liver disease [5]. There is a circulation between the liver and the intestine that can affect each other significantly.

Recent advances in microbiome research have highlighted the gut-liver axis as a critical player in the pathogenesis and progression of CLD. Numerous studies analyzing fecal microbiota have reported alterations in microbial composition associated with various etiological forms of CLD, including NAFLD, HBV, HCV, and ALD [6,7]. However, these studies predominantly rely on fecal samples, which may not adequately reflect the mucosal-associated microbiota, which is the community more directly involved in host microbe interactions and immune modulation [8]. In recent years, a limited number of studies have profiled the colonic mucosal microbiota in chronic liver Similarly, In diseases, revealing more distinct and disease-related microbial patterns compared to fecal samples. For example, Bajaj et al. reported a marked increase in pro-inflammatory taxa such asEnterobacteriaceaeandStreptococcaceaefrom colonic mucosal samples in cirrhotic patients [9]. Similarly, in NAFLD patients, both fecal and mucosal samples were analyzed. Taxa such asLachnospiraceae,Veillonellaceae, andEnterococcus faeciumwere found to be increased in the NAFLD group, whereasCollinsellaandOscillospiraceaewere more dominant in the control group [10]. These studies support the notion that mucosa-associated microbiota offers a more representative profile in terms of epithelial barrier function and immunological crosstalk with the liver. Moreover, these findings reinforce the biological plausibility of the taxonomic shifts observed in our study and validate the biopsy-based approach utilized.

The limitations of fecal sampling, such as regional variation in microbial populations along the gastrointestinal tract, sample storage inconsistencies, and inability to capture mucosal adherent microbes, have been widely acknowledged [11,12]. Especially in chronic liver disease, where increased intestinal permeability and immune crosstalk play central roles, mucosal microbiota is thought to better represent the pathophysiological landscape [13]. Despite this, studies examining the mucosa-associated microbiota in CLD remain scarce due to technical and ethical challenges related to biopsy collection. Recent pilot investigations employing colonic mucosa samples have suggested distinct microbial patterns in CLD patients, including overrepresentation of pro-inflammatory taxa and depletion of beneficial commensals [14,15]. These findings underline the need for more comprehensive, biopsy-based microbiome profiling to unravel the gut-liver interface and its implications for disease staging, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies.

The identification of intestinal microbiota can provide information about the stage, prognosis, complication risk, and treatment options of patients with CLD. Various methods are applied in the identification of intestinal microbiota composition. The most commonly used one is the analysis of fecal samples. However, this method has some disadvantages, such as, errors that may occur in the stages of sample collection, storage, transportation, processing, and analysis. In addition, the composition of intestinal microbiota may vary according to the intestinal region, which means that the fecal sample may not be sufficient. Therefore, more standardized, sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective methods need to be developed for the identification of intestinal microbiota. Analysis of the intestinal microbiota with biopsy specimens is rare because of sterilization difficulties, but colonic mucosa specimens form an enduring microbiota profile of the gut. This metagenomic study aims to address this gap by analyzing the mucosa-associated gut microbiota in CLD patients using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of colonic biopsy specimens. By focusing on a more physiologically relevant microbial niche, we hope to provide deeper insights into host–microbiota interactions that contribute to liver pathology.

Data from patients with CLD and control individuals were obtained from the hospital system in Balcalı Hospital Gastroenterology Clinic. Ethical permissions for this study were approved by Çukurova University Ethics Committee on December 4, 2020 (institutional review board and clinical trial number 2020–13099). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The designed metagenomic study was completed by the criteria in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The diagnosis of chronic liver disease (CLD) was established through a combination of ultrasonography (USG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), liver biopsy, and histopathological evaluation. The Brunt scoring system was used to assess degrees of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Fibrosis stages were classified as follows: F0 (no fibrosis), F1 (minimal), F2 (moderate), F3 (advanced fibrosis), and F4 (cirrhosis). The study group included individuals aged 40 years or older who met the following inclusion criteria: Elevated aminotransferase levels (ALT and/or AST), Alcohol consumption < 20 g/week, No use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics within the past 6 months, No history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune, psychiatric, or other chronic disorders (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune hepatitis), No malignancy or prior gastrointestinal surgery.

Control group individuals were age- and sex-matched, with no history or clinical evidence of liver disease, and normal aminotransferase levels. Individuals < 40 years of age or with any acute/chronic illness were excluded. USG and MRI were performed to exclude hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Individuals with alcohol consumption ≥ 20 g/week or any antibiotic/probiotic/prebiotic use within the past 12 months were excluded. Additionally, smokers were not included in the control group. All control subjects were selected from individuals presenting for routine health screening at the university hospital’s gastroenterology outpatient clinic and had no systemic comorbidities.

Colon biopsy samples were obtained from 40 patients (20 CLD and 20 control groups) who applied to the Balcalı Hospital Gastroenterology Clinic. A metagenomic study was designed between 2020 and 2022. The population groups included in the study comprised the Mediterranean region. Rectal mucosal biopsy specimens were collected during colonoscopy using sterile forceps and stored in cryotubes at − 80 °C.

Metagenomic DNA was extracted from colonic mucosal tissues using the IANamp Genomic DNA kit. DNA concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer. The extracted metagenomic DNA was stored in a deep freezer (−80 °C) for 16 S rRNA amplification.

The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted and amplified using the forward primer 341 F (5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’) and reverse primer 805R (5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’). PCR reactions were prepared using 25 µl of Taq Green Master Mix, 1 µl of each primer (10 µM), 2 µl of the DNA sample, and 21 µl of nuclease-free water, resulting in a total reaction volume of 50 µl. The thermal cycling conditions included an initial denaturation phase at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. A final extension step was conducted at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The sequencing process utilized the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc.), and sequence quality was assessed with FastQC. Subsequent sequence processing, including filtering, alignment, clustering, and taxonomic classification, was performed using QIIME software. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were consolidated based on 97% sequence similarity, and taxonomy was assigned using the Greengenes database as a reference. Diversity metrics were evaluated through QIIME 2, with Shannon index employed for alpha diversity and Bray-Curtis distance for beta diversity. Statistical comparisons of alpha and beta diversity between groups were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and the PERMANOVA test, respectively.

After amplification, Illumina dual indexes were added and purified using a Nextera XT index kit. The concentration of the created libraries was diluted to 4nM. After this step, the samples were pooled and denatured with NaOH. Hybridization buffer was used for dilution. MiSeq®sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq™ instrument after denaturing with heat in the final step. FASTQ output files were used for downstream analysis.

Sequence results were obtained using the Illumina MiSeq™ platform. Sequence data were automatically converted to FASTQ format by the MiSeq™ instrument. Data analysis was performed using QIIME2 software. Greengenes2 database was used for identification and taxonomic assignment of microbiota sequences. Filtering Steps: Raw sequence data were filtered using QIIME2 software according to the criteria of minimum 200 bp length and maximum 1 base error. In addition, low-quality sequences and chimera sequences were detected and removed from the data using the UCHIME algorithm. Clustering: Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered using the UCLUST algorithm using a 97% similarity threshold. This process was performed to determine taxonomic diversity. Microbial abundance data were normalized by proportioning to the total number of sequences. This ensures that abundances are comparable across samples. Data were log transformed to reduce variation and normalize the distribution. Rarefaction was also applied to remove technical variations that may occur in the sequence data.

Statistical analysis of the data was performed using R software (v.4.0.2). Alpha Diversity Analysis, Shannon and Chao1 diversity indices were calculated to evaluate community diversity. These indices measure species richness and evenness in each sample. Beta diversity analysis, Bray-Curtis measurements were used to compare community structure between samples. The primary goal of beta diversity analysis is to examine the structural relationships between samples within and across groups. This involves comparing samples with other samples within the same group and with different groups. To achieve this, Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) was performed to visualize differences in microbial community structure across samples. PCoA is distinct from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as it takes into account the distances between organisms associated with each sample. Furthermore, the group affiliations of the samples form a crucial part of this analysis. PCoA analyses were carried out using Bray-Curtis methods. These analyses determine similarities and differences between microbial communities. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were applied to evaluate statistical differences between different groups. These tests were used to compare independent samples between groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of confounding factors such as age and gender. Model fit and variable effects were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

In the metagenomic study, colonic mucosal biopsy material was studied from a total of 40 individuals, 20 with CLD and 20 healthy controls. The mean age of CLD patients was 58.60 years. Etiological distribution was observed as HBV 65%, HCV 15%, and NAFLD 5%. 10% of CLD patients were at the cirrhosis stage (Table1). Liver enzyme parameters such as AST, ALT, and GGT were higher in patients with CLD than in the control group. Detailed results of all data are shown in Table1.

The data obtained in this study reveal that the gut microbiota of patients with CLD is significantly different from that of the healthy control group. At the phylum level,ProteobacteriaandFirmicutesare the dominant taxa in both groups. However, the proportion ofProteobacteriais higher in the CLD group compared to the control group. This may indicate a potentially increased inflammatory condition and immune response in CLD patients (Fig.1a).

The CLD group has higher rates ofGammaproteobacteriabacterial groups compared to the control group. However, no significant difference is observed between the two groups in terms of other bacterial groups. These results show that the microbial composition of the CLD group is different from the control group, but not completely separate. At the class level, an increase inGammaproteobacteriais observed in the CLD group. Members of this class may influence metabolic pathways involved in liver disease pathogenesis. In particular, some pathogens belonging to this class are known to trigger inflammatory processes in the liver (Fig.1b).

In the CLD group, the proportion of theEnterobacteralesorder is higher compared to the control group, while the proportion of theClostridialesorder is slightly higher in the control group. The proportions of other orders are similar in both groups. These results indicate that the microbial composition of the CLD group differs from that of the control group. Particularly, the differences in the proportions of theEnterobacteralesandClostridialesorders can help us understand how the microbial structures of these two groups have changed. At the order level, the presence of various taxa in the CLD group is notable, indicating increased microbial diversity. Statistical analyses support these differences with p-values, showing they are significant. Especially, the increase or decrease in the proportions of certain taxa in the CLD group suggests that these microorganisms may affect the course of the disease (Fig.1c). The gut microbiota of CLD patients may have a significant impact on the development and progression of the disease. These microbial changes could offer new targets for understanding and treating CLD.

At the family level, the proportion of organisms belonging to theEnterobacteriaceaefamily is higher in the CLD group compared to the control group. This family includes pathogenic bacteria associated with intestinal infections and inflammatory processes. TheVeillonellaceaefamily is found at similar rates in both groups, while theLachnospiraceaefamily shows a slight increase in the CLD group (Fig.2a).

At the genus level, the genusPrevotellais more dominant in the control group compared to the CLD group.Prevotellais known to be associated with digestive system diseases. An increase in the genusStreptococcuswas also observed in the control group, suggesting that members of this genus may be associated with CLD (Fig.2b).

At the species level, species such asPhotobacterium damselaeare found at different rates in the CLD group. The presence of these species demonstrates the diversity of the gut microbiota of CLD patients and potentially microorganisms that can affect the course of the disease (Fig.2c).

In the etiologies of HBV and HCV, the proportion ofProteobacteriais higher than others, indicating the impact of viral hepatitis on the gut microbiota. In the NAFLD and Crypto categories, the proportions ofFirmicutesandClostridiaare noteworthy (Fig.3a). As the stages of fibrosis progress, an increase in the proportion of theFirmicutesphylum is observed, while the proportions of theProteobacteriaandClostridiaphyla decrease. This suggests a potential association betweenFirmicutesand fibrosis progression. At the stage of cirrhosis, the proportion ofFirmicutesis observed to be the highest, while the proportions ofProteobacteriaandClostridiaare the lowest (Fig.3b).

Alpha diversity analyses using Shannon and Chao1 indices revealed significant differences between the CLD group and the control group. The CLD group showed lower diversity compared to the control group. This finding suggests that CLD has a negative effect on microbial diversity. Statistical significance was confirmed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p< 0.05). Beta diversity analyses showed significant structural differences between the CLD patients and control groups. PCoA analyses using Bray-Curtis distance measurements revealed significant separations between the two groups. However, beta diversity analyses showed that there were significant variations not only between disease conditions but also between samples. These variations may be due to individual microbiome differences and require further investigation (Fig.4a, b,c, d).

In the study, multivariant analyses of biochemical and metagenomic parameters of two groups were examined. For GGT, OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.96–0.98),p= 0.03 in biochemical parameter (Table2),Enterobacterales, OR:1.89 (95%CI 1.00-3.58) p-value was 0.04 in metagenomics. (Table3). In this context, biochemical parameters (GGT, ALT, AST) were integrated with metagenomic parameters (Proteobacteria,Firmicutes,Enterobacterales) in CLD patients. This finding suggests that demographic factors may modulate the microbial effects of CLD. These findings indicate that the gut microbiota in CLD patients undergoes significant changes and these changes may be related to the pathophysiology of the disease. It is also emphasized that microbial diversity is affected by demographic factors and these effects should be taken into account in disease management (Fig.5).

Intestinal microbiota is an influential factor in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases together with NAFLD, HBV, and HCV etiologies. The linkage mechanism between CLD and gut microdiversity is not yet fully understood. The prevailing hypothesis regarding intestinal microbiota suggests a link between intestinal permeability and chronic liver disease [16]. A colon biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue from the intestinal wall. It can reflect the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota more accurately. In addition, a colon biopsy can also reveal the structure, inflammation, and damage of the intestinal wall. This approach facilitates a better understanding of the mechanisms between the intestinal microbiota and liver disease. In this study, the first metagenomic microbiota study was performed with colonic mucosal biopsy specimens and various etiological factors in CLD patients. According to the results of our study, the intestinal microbiota profile of patients with CLD differed significantly from healthy controls. In patients with CLD, the alpha diversity of the intestinal microbiota was reduced. These include bacteria such asFirmicutes,Lachnospiraceae,Ruminococcaceae,Faecalibacterium, andRoseburia. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria such asProteobacteria,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia, andShigellaincreased in patients with CLD. Significant statistical associations were observed between the intestinal microbiota composition and liver function tests, clinical findings, and demographic data.

Studies have revealed that the composition and metabolites of the intestinal microbiota play a significant role in the progression of CLD. In this context, it has been found that 21 species in the intestinal microbiota affect the risk of liver cirrhosis and 11 of them show genetic predisposition. For example, it is reported that there is a relationship between theLachnospiraceaefamily, which increases the risk of liver cirrhosis, and theErysipelatoclostridiumgenus, which reduces the risk [17]. Liu et al. reported that, in general, the most abundant taxa in CLD patients were members of the phylaFirmicutes,Bacteroidetes,Actinobacteria, andProteobacteria[12]. In our study, whileFirmicutesincreased in the control group,Bacteroidetes,Actinobacteria, andProteobacteriamembers increased in the CLD group. Different etiological factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease with various common mechanisms [5,18,19]. There is an increase in intestinal barrier permeability in patients with NAFLD and obesity; thus metabolic endotoxemia and blood levels of LPS begin to increase. Microbiota-associated LPS has been reported to be associated with the degree of liver injury and progression to NASH [20]. Ethanol and its metabolites cause disruption of tight junctions and increased intestinal permeability, resulting in intestinal barrier dysfunction. Intestinal microbiota,Bacteroides fragilis,Escherichia,Bifidobacterium adolescent, andClostridium thermocellumspecies can ferment dietary carbohydrates into ethanol, which then enters the bloodstream and is eventually eliminated in the liver [21]. Ethanol interferes with the regulation of E polypeptide 1, can inhibit fatty acid ß-oxidation and cause lipid accumulation as well as exacerbate hepatic inflammation and fibrosis [22]. It has been found that ethanol-producing bacterial species such asEnterocloster bolteaeare enriched in the intestinal microbiota of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. In addition, it has been observed that this strain produces high amounts of ethanol. These species are thought to be associated with human diseases such as autism, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as ethanol production, which may play a role in the progression of liver disease [23]. Studies have reported that the hepatitis B virus affects the microbiota profile of the host. The composition of the microbiota in patients with HBV infection may differ. It has been reported in studies that a decrease in bacterial diversity occurs with HBV infection [24]. A change in bacterial diversity has been observed with HBV infection in CLD diseases [25]. Zhu et al. reported that bacterial diversity significantly changed in HBV-infected mice. AlthoughPhascolarctobacteriumandClostridium_XIVAwere significantly increased at the genus level in patients infected with HBV, the abundance ofGemmigerspecies was found to be decreased [26]. As many researchers have reported, the intestinal microbiota of HBV patients has changed and plasma endotoxin levels are significantly higher than in healthy individuals [27,28] this leads to cirrhosis in HCC due to microbial dysbiosis and endotoxemia [8], but the antiviral activity of probiotics prevents chronic HBV infection and slows down HCC progression [29,30]. Probiotic bacteria have played a defining role in mechanisms such as intestinal mucosal barrier function, decrease in endotoxin levels, and systemic immunity. It has been reported thatBifidobacteriumspecies from this group of bacteria show a decrease in HBV-associated decompensated cirrhosis, whileLactobacillusincrease [31]. In parallel with these results,Lactobacillusincreased in the CLD group, while a decrease was observed inFirmicutesandEnterobacterialesorders. The microbiome analysis in the mouse cecum contents showed thatLactococcus lactiswas effective in preventing and treating liver fibrosis in all mouse models, but the effect of otherLactobacillusspecies was variable [32]. It is observed that causes such as a continuous inflammatory process, destruction and regeneration of the liver parenchyma play an active role in the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis in CLD. The flora that makes up the gut microbiota triggers fibrosis progression in CLD by inducing TLR pathways [33,34]. In this context, LPS constitutes both an important component in the cell wall structure of gram-negative bacteria and the TLR4 ligand [35]. This amplifies hepatic cytokine release via enhanced inflammatory signaling in the liver and represents the inflammatory waterfall pattern in fibrosis. Studies have reported a decrease inFirmicutesspecies due to the development of fibrosis, on the contrary, an increase inAcinetobacteras the pathogen of tissue infections [17,36]. The results of our studies are in parallel with and support the information mentioned above.

Cirrhosis is the last stage of CLD, and it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota may also be altered in liver cirrhosis [37]. Patients with liver cirrhosis generally show a decrease inLachnospiraceae,Ruminococcaceae,Veillonellaceae, andClostridiales incertae sedis XIV, while an increase inStaphylococcaceae,Enterobacteriaceae, andEnterococcaceae[38]. Evidence suggests increased oral microbiota in stool, high periodontitis rate, changes in salivary microbiota, use of proton pump inhibitors, and relatively low stomach acid levels can be observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In NAFLD-associated cirrhosis, there is an increase in the levels ofVeillonella parvula,Veillonella atypica,Ruminococcus gnavus,Clostridium bolteaeandAcidaminococcus spp, while a decrease in the levels ofEubacterium eligens,Eubacterium rectaleandFaecalibacterium prausnitziihas been reported [39]. The progression and clinical prognosis of liver cirrhosis are affected by the changes in the intestinal microbiota, which are associated with severe microbial imbalance and reduction of SCFA-producing bacteria in patients who reach the decompensated stage.Firmicutesabundance is related to liver function and is low in patients with high levels of ALT, AST, and DBIL, while it is reported that improvement can be achieved with probiotic treatment in patients with decompensated cirrhosis in a retrospective study [40]. In chronic liver patients, enzyme elevations, microbial dysbiosis, and cirrhosis play an important role in the progression of HCC, which is the most common primary cancer. The pathogenesis of HCC may develop on the background of CLD etiological factors. Intestinal microbiota profiles of etiological factors are important for a better understanding of this disease. Data from clinical and animal studies help analyze the distribution of the gut microbiome in hosts with HCC. Metagenomic studies with HCC patients report a significant increase inE. coli[41]. HBV, HCV, and NAFLD constitute important etiological factors in HCC progression. In this context, CLD may play a precursor role in the development of HCC. In our study, HBV was found to be 65% in the etiology of CLD, and the most striking increase in the HBV-based CLD gut microbiota profile was observed in theBlautia(5.31%) andFaecalibacterium(2.24%) genera.

Thanks to new generation applications, it has become easy and applicable to analyze and understand the gut microbiota distribution, diversity, and functional data more deeply with artificial intelligence ML algorithms [42–44]. The metagenomic gut microbiota study with colonic mucosal biopsy specimens in CLD patients was analyzed for the first time in the Turkish population. Although our study contains important data in terms of diagnosis and treatment in patients with CLD, there are a few shortcomings. Differences such as the inadequacy of the patient population, the cost, and the fact that the study population is specific to the Mediterranean region are seen as important deficiencies. In addition, our study group is small and single-centered. Moreover, colon biopsy is a more invasive and expensive method than a stool sample. Therefore, there is a need for more studies on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of this method. Considering these limited parameters, it is thought that experimental studies to be prepared with this draft on large cohort populations can provide meaningful results in the diagnosis and treatment of CLD disease.

In this metagenomic study, significant differences were identified in the colonic mucosal microbiota composition of CLD patients compared to healthy individuals. A decrease was observed in taxa known for their beneficial and anti-inflammatory effects in CLD patients, while bacteria with pro-inflammatory potential were found to be elevated. Additionally, alpha diversity was significantly reduced in the CLD group, and beta diversity showed notable differences between the groups. The integration of these microbial alterations with clinical parameters may offer valuable insights for CLD characterization and the development of personalized treatment strategies. However, it is considered that these parameters alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis and should be evaluated in conjunction with radiological and clinical findings.

We are grateful to the Balcalı hospital institution and the patients for their contributions to this metagenomic study.
