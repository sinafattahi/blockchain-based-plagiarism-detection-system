Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Approximately one-third to one-half of cases of TBI are associated with severe extracranial injuries, particularly abdominal trauma. This combination is associated with high mortality rates. However, studies describing the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with combined severe head and abdominal trauma are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes and identify prognostic factors in this patient population.

This single-centre, retrospective observational study included patients with major trauma, TBI, and abdominal injury admitted to a Level 1 trauma centre from 2016 to 2020. The inclusion criteria were TBI with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥ 3 and abdominal injury with an AIS score ≥ 3. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at discharge.

Of 4,554 patients screened, 160 met the inclusion criteria. The in-hospital mortality rate was 20.6%, and 63.1% of the patients had favourable functional outcomes. Multivariate analysis identified factors associated with increased mortality: lower initial mean arterial pressure (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91–0.98,p= 0.006), higher base deficit (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45,p= 0.022), lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62–0.91,p= 0.004), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05,p= 0.029), lower platelet count (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00,p= 0.008), and lower fibrinogen level (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01,p= 0.014). For unfavorable functional outcomes, independent predictors included lower initial GCS score (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78–0.95,p= 0.002), head AIS score of 5 (OR: 3.52, 95% CI: 1.32–9.40,p= 0.012), lower platelet count (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.012), and massive transfusion requirement (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.23–6.95,p= 0.015).

This study demonstrates a 20.6% mortality rate in patients with combined severe head and abdominal injuries. The findings identified key prognostic factors, including initial GCS score and platelet count. These results suggest that platelet dysfunction plays a crucial role in both mortality and functional outcomes. Early recognition and management of these factors are crucial for improving outcomes in critically injured patients.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and has a significant impact on public health and socioeconomic consequences [1,2]. Approximately 33–50% of TBI cases are accompanied by severe extracranial injuries, with abdominal trauma being a common concomitant injury [1,3,4]. The combination of severe head and abdominal injuries is associated with higher mortality rates and worse outcomes compared to isolated TBI [1,3–6].

The management of patients with combined severe TBI and abdominal trauma is particularly challenging, as both injuries require immediate attention and can result in life-threatening complications [4,6]. Extracranial injuries may exacerbate secondary brain injury through hypotension and hypoxia, which are known to negatively impact TBI outcomes [5,7,8]. While various studies have identified clinical predictors of mortality and unfavorable outcomes in patients with severe TBI and concomitant extracranial injuries [9–14], the specific impact of abdominal injury management strategies on neurological outcomes remains unclear. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined the interaction between surgical timing for abdominal injuries and TBI outcomes, nor have they provided clear guidance on surgical prioritization in hemodynamically unstable patients with both injuries.

Moreover, the optimal management strategies for patients with combined severe TBI and abdominal trauma are not well-established. Some studies suggest that early surgical intervention for abdominal injuries may improve outcome [4,15,16], while others emphasize the importance of damage control strategies and prompt neurosurgical interventions for TBI [17–19].

Given the limited evidence and the complexity of managing these patients, further research is needed to better understand their prognostic factors and identify optimal treatment approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe TBI and concomitant abdominal injuries, identify factors affecting prognosis including mortality and functional outcomes, and specifically examine the impact of abdominal injury management strategies on neurological outcomes.

This retrospective observational study was conducted at the Ajou University Trauma Center, a single Level 1 trauma center in South Korea, between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020. Ajou University Hospital South Gyeonggi Regional Trauma Center serves major trauma patients across southern Gyeonggi Province, which has a population of 9 million. It is the only Level 1 trauma center with neurosurgical capabilities and receives transfers from 15 hospitals within a 100 km radius. The center operates under a trauma system modeled after American College of Surgeons verification standards. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Hospital/Human Research Protection Center of Ajou University Hospital (AJOUIRB-DB-2024-028). Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study and the use of de-identified data to protect patient privacy.

All patients with major trauma (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≥ 15) admitted to the Ajou University Trauma Center during the study period were screened for inclusion. Data were obtained from the Ajou Trauma Registry. Inclusion criteria were traumatic brain injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥ 3 and abdominal injury with an AIS score ≥ 3. This AIS threshold was chosen to focus on clinically significant severe injuries that would likely impact patient management and outcomes. Patients younger than 16 years or those with missing data were excluded. Patients with other associated injuries were included, as polytrauma is common in this population.

Demographic data, injury characteristics, vital signs, laboratory findings, coagulation profiles, trauma severity scores, brain and abdominal injury types, and interventions were collected. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at discharge. Secondary outcomes included the need for surgery or angioembolization, massive transfusion protocol activation, transfusion requirements within 24 h, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, hospital events, and mechanical ventilation duration. Additional data collected included presence of severe extra-abdominal/head injuries (AIS ≥ 3 in other body regions), specific organ injuries, and timing of interventions.

Massive transfusion was defined as the transfusion of > 10 units of packed red blood cells within the first 24 h of admission. Coagulopathy was defined as an international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 60 s, or a platelet count < 100,000/µL. A favorable GOS was defined as a score of 4 or 5, whereas an unfavorable GOS was defined as a score of 1, 2, or 3. Emergency laparotomy for hemorrhage control was defined as laparotomy performed within 2 h of admission in patients presenting with hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) or those who deteriorated within the first hour.

Categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages, while continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Univariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Clinically relevant parameters and variables with a p-value < 0.1 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality and unfavorable GOS scores. Thep< 0.1 threshold was chosen to avoid missing potentially important predictors, following standard epidemiological practice for exploratory analyses. The results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Multicollinearity was assessed among the variables. The accuracy of the regression models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with 95% CI. Subgroup analyses were performed comparing direct admission versus inter-hospital transfer, and examining outcomes based on surgical management strategies. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA).

During the study period, a total of 4,554 patients with major trauma were screened. Of these, 185 patients met the inclusion criteria. After excluding 25 patients (12 patients younger than 16 years, 15 with missing data, and two meeting both exclusion criteria), 160 patients were included in the final analysis (Fig.1). The median age of the patients was 49.5 years (IQR: 34.8–60.0), and 75.6% (n= 121) were male. Blunt trauma accounted for 99.4% (n= 159) of cases, with automobile versus pedestrian being the most common mechanism of injury (37.5%,n= 60), followed by falls (23.1%,n= 37). The median ISS was 34 (IQR: 27–43), and the median initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 8 (IQR: 5–14). The most common head injury severity was an AIS score of 3 (56.9%,n= 91), while most abdominal injuries had an AIS score of 3 (73.8%,n= 118). A total of 142 patients (88.8%) had severe extra-injuries (AIS ≥ 3) in other body regions, with thoracic injuries being most common (45.6%,n= 73), followed by extremity injuries (31.3%,n= 50), facial injuries (8.1%,n= 13), and external injuries (5.6%,n= 9). Table1presents detailed patient characteristics and outcomes.

Of the 160 patients, 58 (36.3%) were transferred from other hospitals. Comparison between patients brought directly from the scene and those transferred from another hospital revealed no significant differences in mortality (19.6% vs. 22.4%,p= 0.672) or favorable functional outcomes (64.7% vs. 60.3%,p= 0.582). Patients transferred from another hospital experienced longer delays in receiving definitive care (median 4.2 vs. 1.0 h,p< 0.001) and were more likely to have received initial resuscitation, including blood products, prior to arrival (41.4% vs. 7.8%,p< 0.001). These findings suggest that appropriate stabilization at referring hospitals may help mitigate the impact of delayed definitive care.

Analysis of specific organ injuries revealed important patterns. Liver injuries (n= 85, 53.1%) had an operative rate of 32.9% (28/85), with grade IV-V injuries more likely to require surgery (78.6% vs. 18.3%,p< 0.001). Spleen injuries (n= 56, 35.0%) had an operative rate of 28.6% (16/56), with similar grade-dependent patterns. Notably, hollow viscus injuries, despite often having lower AIS scores, had high operative rates: small bowel injuries 70.6% (12/17) and colon injuries 76.9% (10/13). Patients with hollow viscus injuries had comparable mortality to solid organ injuries (23.5% vs. 19.8%,p= 0.683), challenging the assumption that lower AIS scores indicate better prognosis in combined injuries.

In univariable analysis between survivors and non-survivors (Table2), non-survivors demonstrated significantly lower initial mean arterial pressure (53.7 vs. 70.0 mmHg,p< 0.001), higher base deficit (-8.0 vs. -5.7 mEq/L,p= 0.004), lower platelet count (157 vs. 204 × 10³/µl,p= 0.003), prolonged aPTT (51 vs. 32 s,p< 0.001), lower fibrinogen level (110 vs. 208 mg/dL,p< 0.001), and lower initial GCS score (3 vs. 11,p< 0.001). Additionally, non-survivors had significantly higher rates of hypotension (36.4% vs. 12.6%,p= 0.001) and massive transfusion (62.1% vs. 24.2%,p< 0.001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20.6% (n= 33). Multivariate analysis identified initial mean arterial pressure (MAP) (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91–0.98,p= 0.006), base deficit (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45,p= 0.022), initial GCS score (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62–0.91,p= 0.004), activated PTT (aPTT) (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05,p= 0.029), platelet count (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00,p= 0.008), and fibrinogen level (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01,p= 0.014) as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (Table4).

A critical subgroup comprised 23 patients (14.4%) who required emergency laparotomy for hemorrhage control. Of these, 19 presented with hypotension on admission, while 4 deteriorated within the first hour. Hemorrhage sources included liver (n= 15), spleen (n= 6), and mesenteric vessels (n= 2). This subgroup had significantly higher mortality (39.1% vs. 16.8%,p= 0.018) compared to other patients. Notably, patients with door-to-OR time < 1 h (n= 11) had 27.3% mortality versus 50.0% for those with longer delays (n= 12) (p= 0.089), though this did not reach statistical significance due to small sample size. Among survivors in this subgroup, delayed ICP monitoring (> 6 h) occurred in 71.4% (10/14), potentially impacting neurological outcomes.

Comparing patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes (Table3), univariable analysis revealed that patients with unfavorable outcomes had significantly lower initial mean arterial pressure (58.7 vs. 70.0 mmHg,p= 0.002), higher base deficit (-7.9 vs. -5.3 mEq/L,p< 0.001), lower platelet count (174 vs. 208 × 10³/µl,p= 0.002), prolonged aPTT (42 vs. 32 s,p< 0.001), lower initial GCS score (5 vs. 13,p< 0.001), and higher rates of head AIS = 5 (44.1% vs. 12.9%,p< 0.001). Furthermore, patients with unfavorable outcomes required massive transfusion more frequently (50.9% vs. 19.7%,p< 0.001). Favorable functional outcomes (GOS 4–5) at discharge were observed in 63.1% (n= 101) of patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that initial GCS score (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78–0.95,p= 0.002), head AIS = 5 (OR: 3.52, 95% CI: 1.32–9.40,p= 0.012), platelet count (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.012), and massive transfusion (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.23–6.95,p= 0.015) were independent predictors of unfavorable functional outcomes (Table4).

Analysis of surgical interactions revealed important patterns. Three patients required both craniectomy and laparotomy within 24 h, with 66.7% mortality (2/3). Among patients requiring craniectomy (n= 13), those who had it performed within 6 h had better functional outcomes (GOS 4–5: 60% vs. 25%,p= 0.032). For patients undergoing laparotomy (n= 55), concurrent severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8) was associated with higher mortality (32.3% vs. 12.5%,p= 0.041) compared to those with moderate TBI.

Within 24 h of admission, 45.6% (n= 73) of patients required surgery, with a median door-to-operating room time of 1.8 h (IQR: 0.9–5.7). Angioembolization was performed within 24 h in 31.3% (n= 50) of patients. The massive transfusion protocol was initiated in 33.1% (n= 41) of patients. The median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 9 (IQR: 5–22) and 27 days (IQR: 14–47), respectively. Hospital events were observed in 51.3% (n= 82) of patients, and the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 11 days (IQR: 4–19) (Table1). Non-operative management failure occurred in 8 patients (5.0%), all requiring surgery within 72 h of admission.

This study investigated the outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with severe concomitant head and abdominal injuries. Our findings provide novel insights into the management of these complex patients, particularly regarding the interaction between abdominal injury management and neurological outcomes. The in-hospital mortality rate was 20.6%, and 63.1% of patients achieved favorable functional outcomes at discharge. Key independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included initial MAP, base deficit, GCS score, aPTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen level. Predictors of unfavorable functional outcomes were initial GCS score, head AIS = 5, platelet count, and the need for massive transfusion.

Our study makes several important contributions to the existing literature. First, we demonstrate that hemorrhage control timing (< 1 h) for emergency laparotomy impacts not only survival but also neurological outcomes, with door-to-OR times < 1 h associated with reduced mortality (27.3% vs. 50.0%). Although this did not reach statistical significance due to small sample size, this finding has not been previously reported and suggests that rapid hemorrhage control may prevent secondary brain injury. Second, we identify platelet count as an independent predictor of both mortality and functional outcomes, indicating that platelet dysfunction plays a dual role in this population. This finding suggests that early platelet transfusion protocols, targeting platelets > 200,000/µL rather than the traditional > 100,000/µL threshold, may benefit these patients. Third, our analysis reveals that hollow viscus injuries, despite lower AIS scores, have comparable mortality to solid organ injuries when combined with TBI, challenging current injury severity scoring assumptions.

Our findings are consistent with previous studies, highlighting the significant mortality associated with combined severe head and abdominal injuries [1,3–6]. The mortality rate in our cohort (20.6%) is comparable to the findings of Watanabe et al. (22.2%) [1] and Jakob et al. (25.0%) [4], emphasizing the critical nature of these injuries and the importance of prompt and effective intervention. We identified several factors associated with mortality, echoing earlier studies that underscored hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, and head injury severity as crucial prognostic factors in trauma patients [9–14]. Our analysis underscores the importance of promptly identifying and addressing these physiological derangements to improve patient outcomes.

Regarding functional outcomes, 63.1% of the discharged patients had a favorable status. Head injury severity, as measured by the initial GCS score and head AIS = 5, along with platelet count and the need for massive transfusion, emerged as independent predictors of poor functional outcomes. This is in agreement with the literature indicating the influence of head injury severity and coagulopathy on long-term recovery [2,20].

The inclusion of patients transferred from another hospital (36.3%) in our analysis provides important insights into real-world trauma system functioning. Our finding of similar outcomes between patients brought directly from the scene and those transferred from another hospital (mortality: 19.6% vs. 22.4%,p= 0.672) demonstrates the effectiveness of a well-coordinated trauma system. This suggests that appropriate initial stabilization and timely transfer can achieve outcomes comparable to those brought directly from the scene, supporting the importance of regional trauma networks with standardized protocols.

The management of patients with severe combined injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach. Evidence supports prompt surgical management of abdominal injuries alongside rapid neurosurgical interventions for severe head trauma, which fosters improved outcomes [4,17–19]. Notably, 45.6% of our cohort required surgical intervention within the first 24 h, with a median door-to-operating room time of 1.8 h, highlighting the importance of timeliness.

Based on our findings, we propose the following clinical management algorithm: (1) Simultaneous activation of trauma surgery and neurosurgery teams for all patients with combined severe TBI and abdominal trauma; (2) For patients with active abdominal hemorrhage, proceed to OR within 60 min with preparation for intraoperative ICP monitoring; (3) For stable abdominal injuries with mass effect on head CT, prioritize neurosurgery; (4) When both injuries require urgent intervention, perform damage control laparotomy with simultaneous burr hole/ICP monitor placement; (5) Maintain MAP > 70 mmHg (rather than standard > 65 mmHg) to balance hemorrhage control with cerebral perfusion pressure; (6) Initiate early platelet transfusion for counts < 200,000/µL; (7) Consider prophylactic tranexamic acid within 3 h of injury.

A key strength of this study is the detailed analysis of clinical factors and their impact on patient outcomes, facilitated by a robust trauma registry that ensured comprehensive data collection and adjustment for confounders during multivariate analysis. Additionally, our analysis of organ-specific injuries and surgical timing provides practical guidance not available in previous studies. However, the study has limitations, including its retrospective design, which may introduce selection and information biases, and its single-center scope, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. The use of discharge GOS rather than 3–6 months follow-up is a significant limitation, though discharge GOS has been validated as a reasonable surrogate for short-term outcomes [21]. The regional context of our trauma center in Korea may also limit external validity, though our trauma system follows international standards. Additionally, the absence of long-term functional outcome data limits insight into the enduring effects of these injuries on quality of life. The small sample size in the emergency laparotomy subgroup analysis (n= 23) limited our statistical power to detect significant differences in door-to-OR timing, though the trend toward improved outcomes with rapid intervention is clinically relevant.

To summarize, our research underscores the high mortality risk and the need for early detection and management of physiological disturbances in patients with severe combined head and abdominal injuries. More importantly, we provide novel evidence that rapid hemorrhage control and early platelet transfusion may improve both survival and neurological outcomes. The prognostic indicators identified in this study can inform clinical decisions and resource allocation. Future studies should focus on developing and validating predictive models and assessing the effectiveness of interventions to improve patient outcomes. Prospective studies with long-term follow-up are particularly needed to validate our proposed management algorithm and confirm the benefit of early platelet transfusion in this population.

In this study, we found a 20.6% in-hospital mortality rate and identified the initial GCS score, platelet count, and other physiological factors as independent predictors of mortality and unfavorable functional outcomes in patients with combined severe head and abdominal injuries. Our novel findings regarding hemorrhage control timing and platelet dysfunction provide actionable insights for clinical practice. These findings emphasize the critical nature of these injuries and the importance of early recognition and management of key prognostic factors to improve patient outcomes. We propose a specific management algorithm prioritizing rapid hemorrhage control and early platelet transfusion. Future research should focus on developing targeted interventions and risk-prediction models to optimize the care of critically injured patients and prospectively validate our proposed protocols.
