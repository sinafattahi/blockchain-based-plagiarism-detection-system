Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide, responsible for nearly 1.8 million deaths annually, which accounts for approximately 18.7% of global cancer-related mortality. Cisplatin, a highly effective and widely utilized anticancer drug, is particularly effective against solid tumors and serves as a cornerstone of adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer. Despite continuous optimization of cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of cisplatin resistance frequently results in treatment failure, significantly limiting its clinical utility and therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, researchers have extensively investigated the biological mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance, including impaired DNA repair pathways and inhibition of apoptosis. Among these mechanisms, epigenetic regulation—encompassing DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regulation—has emerged as a critical factor in mediating cisplatin resistance by modulating gene expression and signaling pathways. This review comprehensively explores the role of epigenetic mechanisms in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, highlighting recent research findings and their potential implications for developing strategies to overcome drug resistance.

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality rates primarily attributed to risk factors such as smoking, air pollution, and genetic predisposition. According to recent global statistics, lung cancer accounts for approximately 12.4% of all cancer cases, with nearly 2.5 million new cases diagnosed annually [1]. Lung cancer is broadly classified into two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC, which constitutes about 85% of all lung cancer cases, is the most common form and includes subtypes such as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. In contrast, SCLC, representing approximately 15% of cases, is less common but more aggressive, often associated with a poorer prognosis [2]. Lung cancer is frequently characterized by an insidious onset, with the majority of NSCLC patients diagnosed at advanced or metastatic stages. Despite significant advancements in cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens over the past few decades, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20% [3]. Similarly, although SCLC is initially sensitive to chemotherapy, long-term survival rates remain dismal, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%, largely due to its aggressive nature and high recurrence rate [4].

Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy has become a cornerstone of adjuvant treatment for lung cancer patients. The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II, IIIA, or selected stage IB disease has been shown to improve survival rates by 5–10% [5,6]. Cisplatin, first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1979, is now one of the most widely used chemotherapy drugs, demonstrating significant clinical efficacy against various cancers, including ovarian, bladder, lung, and head and neck tumors [7]. However, the attenuation of DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signaling represents a major limitation in cisplatin-based chemotherapy, ultimately leading to the development of drug resistance [8]. To mitigate its side effects, alternative platinum-based compounds, such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin, have been developed. These agents offer improved patient tolerance while maintaining anticancer efficacy [9]. Unfortunately, many lung cancer patients exhibit poor initial responses to cisplatin, and even those who initially respond often develop resistance over time. Consequently, cisplatin resistance is a critical factor contributing to treatment failure and poor prognosis in lung cancer patients.

Cisplatin resistance is a multifactorial and complex process involving multiple layers of biological regulation. In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. Key mechanisms include the abnormal expression of drug transporters, enhanced DNA damage repair capacity, dysregulation of cell cycle control, and inhibition of apoptosis [10]. Additionally, epigenetic modifications—such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA regulation—play a pivotal role in cisplatin resistance by altering the expression of critical genes involved in drug sensitivity [11]. For example, epigenetic changes can modulate genes associated with cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, autophagy, and DNA damage repair pathways. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms can influence the expression of multidrug resistance-associated proteins, thereby enhancing drug efflux and reducing intracellular drug accumulation [12–14]. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cisplatin resistance is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies. This review focuses on the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, aiming to provide new insights and potential strategies to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcomes.

Cisplatin, as one of the first metal-based chemotherapy drugs. Chemically known as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), cisplatin is an inorganic metal complex consisting of a platinum atom coordinated with two chlorine atoms and two ammonia molecules, forming a planar square structure (Fig.1)[15]. This unique structure makes the cisplatin molecule highly chemically reactive.

Cisplatin, chemically known as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), has the molecular formula Pt(NH3)2Cl2. It is composed of one platinum (Pt) atom coordinated with two ammonia (NH3) ligands and two chloride (Cl⁻) ions, forming a planar square configuration.

Studies have shown that DNA is the primary target of cisplatin’s anticancer activity, and the main cytotoxic effect of cisplatin occurs when it binds to DNA, causing DNA damage that blocks DNA synthesis, halts DNA replication, and activates various signal transduction pathways, ultimately leading to necrosis or apoptosis. These pathways include ATR, p53, MAPK, and others [16,17]. Oxidative stress is also a common effect of cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin can increase the level of oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxides. These ROS can cause DNA damage, thereby triggering apoptosis [18]. As shown in Fig.2, cisplatin binds to DNA to form adducts, inducing DNA damage and subsequent cellular responses.

Cisplatin primarily exerts its cytotoxic effects through the formation of DNA adducts following binding to genomic DNA, which induces DNA damage and disrupts replication processes. This DNA damage subsequently triggers the activation of critical signaling pathways—including the ATR, p53, and MAPK pathways—ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest, apoptotic cell death, or necrosis. As illustrated in the figure, cisplatin treatment also generates elevated levels of ROS, which synergistically exacerbate DNA damage and potentiate cellular demise. This integrated mechanism provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cisplatin’s cytotoxic activity and its fundamental role in cancer therapeutics.

We all know that cisplatin causes DNA damage, which triggers apoptotic signals, but this signal gradually weakens, and the resulting drug resistance problem has become the biggest obstacle to cisplatin treatment for cancer. Platinum-based drug treatments are characterized by both intrinsic and acquired resistance. Intrinsic resistance occurs at the onset of treatment, while acquired resistance develops when the drug is initially effective but gradually becomes less active over time, resulting in resistance [19]. The development of cisplatin resistance in tumor cells is a complex and multifactorial biological phenomenon that involves several molecular mechanisms, such as enhanced DNA repair, apoptotic escape, and increased drug efflux.

Recent studies have shown that cisplatin resistance is associated with alterations in DNA repair pathways. DNA damage repair is a crucial pathway by which cells respond to DNA damage, involving mechanisms such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), and homologous recombination repair (HRR) [20]. Tumor cells can efficiently recognize and repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage through these repair pathways, restoring cellular function and enabling survival [21]. When they fail to repair DNA damage, cells undergo apoptosis [22]. Studies have shown that cisplatin toxicity can be influenced by interference with DNA repair pathways. For example, cells that overexpress NER are less sensitive to cisplatin [23]. Therefore, tumor cells can reduce cisplatin-induced DNA damage by enhancing these repair pathways, ultimately contributing to drug resistance [24].

Decreased drug uptake and increased efflux are key mechanisms by which tumor cells develop resistance to cisplatin. Reduced cisplatin uptake and enhanced efflux result in lower drug accumulation in cancer cells [25]. The copper transporter CTR1 has been shown to be responsible for cisplatin uptake. Cisplatin causes a decrease in CTR1 concentration, which reduces its accumulation in cancer cells and contributes to drug resistance [26,27]. Cells with higher CTR1 expression are more sensitive to cisplatin [16]. Additionally, multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, such as P- glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), and ABC transporters, actively pump a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, out of cells. This reduces drug accumulation and diminishes their efficacy [28]. In addition, the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B are also involved in the efflux process of cisplatin and result drug resistance [29].

In addition, cisplatin exerts its anti-tumor effects by inducing apoptosis. However, tumor cells can escape apoptosis through various mechanisms, such as upregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), downregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak), or activating survival signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT, MAPK). These processes enable tumor cells to resist cisplatin-induced apoptosis [30–32].

Epigenetic modifications refer to changes in the expression and function of genes that regulate without any modification of the DNA sequence, mainly including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA expression [33]. Compared to stable genetic events, epigenetic changes are highly malleable. Studies have found that epigenetic modifications may contribute to the development of multiple cancer types, which play a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of lung cancer [34,35]. Moreover, there is growing evidence of a clear link between epigenetic modifications and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer [36] (Fig.3), for example abnormal DNA methylation status, overexpression or downregulation of microRNAs, etc.

The figure systematically summarizes several key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. It illustrates the functional roles of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs (including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs) in modulating gene expression: (1) DNA methylation silences tumor suppressor genes (e.g., NNT, HOXA11); (2) histone modifications (e.g., EZH2-mediated H3K27me3) alter chromatin structure; and (3) noncoding RNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs) regulate drug efflux and apoptosis pathways. These epigenetic alterations can affect the transcriptional activity of critical genes, thereby influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis, DNA repair, drug uptake, and efflux, ultimately leading to cisplatin resistance.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that affects gene expression, transcription, and activity [37]. This process involves the transfer of methyl groups to the C5 position of cytosine, forming 5-methylcytosine, and is primarily catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Hypermethylation of gene promoters often leads to transcriptional repression, resulting in reduced gene expression [38,39]. Aberrant methylation patterns, such as genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation in specific gene promoter regions, are commonly observed in tumors, this indicates that abnormal methylation patterns are involved in the development and progression of tumors [40,41]. In normal cells, however, CpG islands are generally unmethylated [42].

Several studies have shown that hypermethylation of DNA is strongly associated with cisplatin resistance [43–45]. Through comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiles, researchers found that DNA methylation levels were significantly higher in cisplatin-resistant tumor samples for NSCLC [46]. Nicotinamide ribotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is a mitochondrial matrixlocalized enzyme [47]. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as NNT and HOXA11 leads to their downregulation, promoting cisplatin resistance. For instance, NNT is silenced by DNA hypermethylation in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells, which promotes autophagy and cisplatin resistance [48]. Similarly, HOXA11 is hypermethylated and downregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells, while the expression level of HOXA11-AS is increased. HOXA11 is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene family, HOXA11-AS, an oncogenic long-chain noncoding RNA, which is a natural antisense transcript of HOXA11 [49]. When the HOXA11 gene is knocked down, it induces cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells; conversely, knocking down the HOXA11-AS gene increases the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin. This inverse interaction between HOXA11 and HOXA11-AS promotes the occurrence of cisplatin resistance [50]. Table1summarizes the key genes associated with cisplatin resistance through DNA methylation, including NNT, HOXA11, and FOXF1.

It enumerates multiple DNA methylation-regulated target genes associated with cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, along with their regulatory mechanisms. Notably, genes including NNT, HOXA11, and CRTAC1exhibit significant hypermethylation in cisplatin-resistant cells, resulting in their transcriptional silencing. This downregulation consequently impairs critical cellular processes such as apoptosis, and transporter protein expression, ultimately enhancing tumor cell chemoresistance. Conversely, other genes (e.g., FOXF1 and MDR1) demonstrate hypomethylation-mediated overexpression, which similarly contributes to drug resistance.

Cisplatin resistance is mainly attributed to the hypermethylation of gene promoters. Methyltransferase inhibitors can reverse this hypermethylation, restoring cisplatin sensitivity. For instance, decitabine (DAC) and 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) are methyltransferase inhibitors capable of reversing drug resistance. Low doses of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A (TSA) can reduce DNA methylation levels and restore gene expression, thereby reversing resistance in A549/DDP cells [46]. Another methyltransferase inhibitor, decitabine (DAC), has been proved to reverse cisplatin resistance through demethylation in bladder cancer cells [45]. Moreover, the combination of methyltransferase inhibitors and cisplatin has shown a synergistic effect. For example, in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine (AZA) and cisplatin together increased apoptosis by regulating levels of the metastasis inhibitor KiSS-1 [51]. Similarly, CRISPR/dCas9-based DNA methylation editing methods have demonstrated high efficiency and specificity in altering DNA methylation levels [52].

DNA methylation abnormalities in certain genes can serve as clinical biomarkers for predicting cisplatin efficacy in lung cancer and may even represent potential therapeutic targets after drug resistance develops. Analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database in NSCLC patients revealed that Cartilage Acidic Protein 1 (CRTAC1), which is highly expressed in normal lung tissues, undergoes promoter hypermethylation leading to its downregulation in tumors. Functional studies demonstrated that CRTAC1 overexpression enhances cisplatin sensitivity by inducing Ca2⁺-dependent Akt1 degradation and promoting apoptosis [53]. Clinical data further supported that patients with high CRTAC1 expression exhibited significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) following cisplatin treatment, suggesting CRTAC1 as a promising predictive biomarker for cisplatin response. Additionally, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes plays a crucial role in cisplatin resistance. For instance, in NSCLC specimens, unmethylated IGFBP-3 promoter status was associated with prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) in stage I patients, indicating that IGFBP-3 methylation status may serve as a clinical biomarker for cisplatin efficacy [54]. Similarly, CDH13 promoter hypermethylation is frequently observed in NSCLC tissues, and demethylation-induced restoration of CDH13 expression reverses cisplatin resistance, highlighting its potential as both a predictive marker and a therapeutic target [55].

In summary, DNA hypermethylation is closely associated with cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. Inhibiting DNA methylation may reverse this resistance, potentially offering a promising treatment strategy for cisplatin-resistant lung cancer.

Noncoding RNA refers to RNA molecules that do not have the ability to encode proteins, including microRNA, long noncoding RNA, and circular RNA. These noncoding RNAs play crucial roles in various biological processes such as gene expression regulation, cell differentiation and development, and tumor occurrence and progression.

MiRNAs are single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules about 19–25 nucleotides long that regulate target genes by binding to their 3'untranslated region, inhibiting translation or promoting transcript degradation [56]. The role of miRNAs in the response of tumor cells to cisplatin and the development of cancer is becoming increasingly clear. Research has found that the expression of miRNAs in drug-resistant cancer cells differs significantly from that in drug-sensitive cells [57]. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been associated with cisplatin sensitivity in lung cancer (Table2).

This table summarizes the noncoding RNAs that are currently strongly associated with cisplatin sensitivity in lung cancer, detailing their expression alterations, target molecules, and functional mechanisms.

Regulatory effects of miRNAs: The expression of MiR-155 and MiR-488 is upregulated, acting on TP53 and eIF3a, respectively, inhibiting apoptosis and activating the NER pathway to enhance drug resistance. Expression of MiR-182-5p, MiR-27b, and MiR-204 is downregulated and is involved in drug resistance regulation by activating survival signaling, affecting EMT, or restoring apoptosis signaling.

Mediation mechanisms of LncRNAs: UCA1, HOXA-AS3, MALAT1, Linc00665, and HOXA11-AS are all upregulated, and they target different molecules or pathways to promote drug resistance by enhancing DNA repair, mediating EMT, activating signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle dysregulation, and upregulating anti-apoptotic genes.

CircRNA involvement pathways: Upregulation of the expression of CircPVT1, Circ_PIP5K1A, and Circ_CPA4, which enhance drug resistance by activating transporter efflux, modulating resistance pump function, and mediating immune escape, respectively. Hsa_circ_0001946, CircsSMARCA5 expression is downregulated and participates in the drug resistance process by affecting DNA damage repair and inhibiting tumor progression. In summary, the above epigenetic molecules are involved in drug resistance through various pathways such as regulating apoptosis, DNA repair, EMT, drug efflux, and immune escape.

For example, the oncogene miR-155 is upregulated in multiple human cancers and further increased in treatment-resistant tumors [58]. And, miR-155 has been shown to induce resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents, and its downregulation can resensitize tumors to chemotherapy. This process is mainly mediated through the miR-155/TP53 feedback loop. A combination of high miR-155 expression and low TP53 expression is significantly associated with shorter survival in lung cancer patients [59]. TP53, also known as p53, is a tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome 17p13 [60]. In addition, miRNA-488 was found to be more expressed in A549/DDP-resistant cells and is associated with cisplatin resistance in two other NSCLC cells, H1299 and SK-MES-1 [61]. Conversely, some miRNAs are downregulated in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells. For instance, miR-182-5p is downregulated in cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells and modulates cisplatin resistance by directly targeting GLI2 in the hedgehog signaling pathway (HHSP) [62]. GLI2 is a transcriptional regulator of the hedgehog pathway, which is commonly reactivated in cancer [63]. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (BMSC-Exo) miR-193a can inhibit the progression of non-small cell lung cancer and promote the expression of miR-193a by downregulating its target gene LRRC1, thereby reducing cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells [64].

MiRNAs contribute to cisplatin resistance in lung cancer by targeting specific genes and proteins. Compared to NSCLC patient samples, miR-27b is expressed at lower levels in adjacent normal tissue controls. Snail, as a target protein of miR-27b, is inhibited when miR-27b is highly expressed, and miR-27b increases the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin and promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition in lung cancer by targeting Snail [65]. miRNAs are also involved in multiple signaling pathways related to cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. For example, miR-29c negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway to inhibit cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells, while miR-204 reduces cisplatin resistance in NSCLC by inhibiting the caveolin-1/AKT/Bad pathway [66,67]. Moreover, miRNAs can interact with each other and synergize with lncRNAs and circRNAs to influence chemosensitivity. For instance, Linc00173 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by “sponging” miRNA-218, thereby regulating the expression of Etk (Epithelial tyrosine kinase) and contributing to chemotherapy resistance in small cell lung cancer [68].

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides [69]. LncRNAs can influence the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin through various mechanisms, including modulating the expression of key genes and interacting with miRNAs [70].

Aberrant expression of lncRNAs plays a significant role in tumorigenesis, development, and metastasis [71]. For instance, overexpression of lncRNA UCA1 has been shown to increase the proliferation and migration abilities of lung adenocarcinoma cells, enhance cisplatin resistance, and is more highly expressed in A549/DDP cells and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. This overexpression may be linked to increased levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) [72]. Similarly, lncRNA UCA1 is upregulated in the tissues and cell lines of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer patients, including serum exosomes, and is involved in cisplatin resistance through the miR-143/FOSL2 pathway regulation [73]. Given its role in cancer progression and cisplatin resistance, UCA1 may serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. HOXA-AS3 is another lncRNA that is overexpressed in various human cancers, including lung cancer [74]. It is also significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells, and promotes cancer cell proliferation [75]. Recent findings suggest a potential link between HOXA-AS3 overexpression and cisplatin resistance. This overexpression enhances cisplatin resistance and induces EMT by downregulating HOXA3 expression [76]. LncRNAs can indirectly regulate ABC transporter gene expression through “sponge” miRNAs, or directly affect their chromatin status and promoter activity, thereby enhancing multidrug resistance as a whole [77]. LINC00707 has previously been reported to be an oncogene able to promote lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and metastasis. However, silencing LINC00707 can enhance cisplatin sensitivity in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells by inhibiting MRP1 and P-gp through spongy miR-145 [78].

MALAT1, also known as NEAT2, is an extensively studied lncRNA in cancer [79]. First identified in NSCLC patients, MALAT1 is upregulated in relation to cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, evasion of apoptosis, and DNA repair defects, indicating its role as an oncogene [80,83]. MALAT1 is closely linked to the development of drug resistance and has been shown to be upregulated in A549/DDP-resistant cell lines, reducing cisplatin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. This is likely due to the activation of STAT3, which upregulates MRP1 and MDR1 [81]. Additionally, MALAT1 forms a feedback loop with miR-101 and SOX9 to modulate cisplatin resistance through the Wnt signaling pathway [82]. Beyond cisplatin, MALAT1 has also been implicated in resistance to other chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, further enhancing resistance in NSCLC cells [84,85]. MALAT1 could serve as a comprehensive target for cisplatin-resistant therapy in lung cancer. lncRNAs are key factors regulating cisplatin sensitivity in lung cancer (Table2).

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed molecules that interact with mRNA and act as molecular sponges to regulate gene expression [86]. These RNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in tumors and normal tissues, including lung cancer, suggesting they may contribute to tumor development [87,88]. Recent studies have shown that circRNAs are closely related to cisplatin resistance and may serve as novel therapeutic targets [89–91] (Table2).

Some circRNAs are aberrantly expressed in resistant tissues or cell lines in lung cancer. For example, circPVT1 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma and upregulated in cisplatin- and pemetrexed-resistant tissues and cell lines. Knocking down circPVT1 expression can resensitize resistant cells to these drugs. CircPVT1 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-145-5p, which targets ABCC1, thus contributing to cisplatin resistance by regulating the miR-145-5p/ABCC1 axis [92]. CircPVT1 is also clinically significant in NSCLC patients treated with cisplatin and gemcitabine. The therapeutic effect can be assessed by detecting circRNA expression in serum, as chemoresistant patients have reduced circPVT1 expression post-treatment compared to chemosensitive patients [93]. MiR-545-3p can inhibit the proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells and promote cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Circ_0072083 enhances the cisplatin inhibitory effect in NSCLC cells through the miR-545-3p/CBLL1 axis [94]. Some downregulated circRNAs are also involved in cisplatin resistance. For instance, has-circ-0001946 downregulation promotes NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, affecting cisplatin sensitivity by modulating the NER signaling pathway [95]. CircsSMARCA5, a tumor suppressor gene, is expressed at low levels in NSCLC tissues and cells. Overexpression of circsSMARCA5 inhibits cell proliferation and enhances sensitivity to cisplatin and gemcitabine [96] [97].

Additionally, dysregulated circRNAs contribute to cisplatin resistance through multiple pathways. ABC transporters, such as P-GP (MDR1) and MRP1, are associated with cisplatin resistance. Circ-0076305 is upregulated in drug-resistant NSCLC, leading to increased expression of these transporters [98]. Exosomes circ_PIP5K1A are overexpressed in NSCLC tissues and cells. Their knockout inhibits lung cancer progression and increases cisplatin sensitivity by modulating the miR-101/ABCC1 axis [99]. ABCC1, a member of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C, reduces drug accumulation in cancer cells, contributing to resistance [100]. Exosomes are involved in cancer development and can promote tumor drug resistance [101]. Circ_CPA4 regulates Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) via the let-7 miRNA, promoting proliferation, invasion, EMT, and cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells. This is due to PD-L1-containing exosomes increasing mRNA levels in stem cells and inactivating CD8 + T cells, leading to immune escape [102].

Although numerous studies have elucidated the regulatory roles of noncoding RNAs in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, conflicting findings regarding their specific functions persist, reflecting the complexity and inconsistency in current mechanistic interpretations. For instance, miR-488 has been reported by some studies to promote cisplatin resistance in lung cancer by targeting eIF3a and upregulating the NER pathway, thereby enhancing tumor cell DNA damage repair capacity and diminishing cisplatin efficacy. However, in other cancer types such as gastric cancer (GC), miR-488 may function as a tumor suppressor, suggesting its role is highly context-dependent and potentially influenced by tissue-specific regulatory networks [103]. Similarly, the lncRNA HOXA11-AS was found to drive cisplatin resistance by modulating the miR-454-3p/STAT3 signaling axis. Yet, other studies indicate that HOXA11-AS forms a bidirectional regulatory loop with the HOXA11 gene, where its overexpression suppresses HOXA11 and promotes resistance, while its inhibition restores cisplatin sensitivity [104]. Such intricate interactions highlight that lncRNA-mediated regulation is not solely dependent on expression levels but also involves competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms.

Furthermore, circPVT1 exhibits a dual role in cisplatin resistance. On one hand, it acts as a miR-145-5p sponge, upregulating ABCC1 expression and conferring resistance to cisplatin and pemetrexed in lung adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, while circPVT1 expression decreases post-treatment, it remains elevated compared to chemotherapy-sensitive patients, suggesting temporal or patient-specific heterogeneity in its functional impact [93]. These discrepancies may stem from variations across tumor types, different subtypes within the same cancer, or temporal dynamics during the development of cisplatin resistance. To address these inconsistencies, we can: (1) conduct large-scale clinical sample analyses to delineate expression patterns of specific ncRNAs across various lung cancer subtypes and treatment stages; (2) identify functionally stable ncRNAs; and (3) employ epigenetic editing tools like CRISPR/dCas9 to validate their causal regulatory relationships.

As we all know, noncoding RNAs play pivotal roles in mediating cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting specific noncoding RNAs to enhance cisplatin efficacy and overcome drug resistance. Furthermore, the dysregulated expression patterns of these noncoding RNAs in lung cancer tissues and cells may serve as promising biomarkers for predicting chemotherapy response and patient prognosis.

Histone modification, a crucial mechanism of epigenetic regulation, controls gene expression by altering the chemical modifications of histone tails (e.g., acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) and affecting the structure and function of chromatin [33]. Recent studies have highlighted the role of histone modifications in cisplatin resistance in NSCLC.

Histone methylation can be regulated by histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases, primarily by the addition or removal of methyl groups from amino acids [105,106]. These enzymes are involved in the occurrence and development of cancer and may even affect the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs [105,107,108]. MJD1 (also known as lysine demethylase 3 A [KDM3A]), a subfamily of JmjC histone demethylases, has been found to be upregulated in various cancers, promoting tumor growth and metastasis [108]. JMJD1B is overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and cell lines, increasing cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the expression of p53. Overexpressed JARID1B can also promote tumor aggressiveness by activating the c-MET signaling pathway and is associated with resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin, which can be reversed by inhibiting their expression. This suggests that JARID1B may promote chemoresistance in NSCLC cells [109].

The zeste enhancer homolog 2 (EZH2) is a catalytic subunit of the multicomb inhibitory complex 2 (PRC2) that mediates the methylation of H3K27, resulting in transcriptional silencing of genes involved in cell differentiation [110]. Dysregulation or overexpression of EZH2 promotes oncogenic transformation by altering chromatin structure and increasing H3K27me3 levels [111]. EZH2, a histone methyltransferase with catalytic activity, is overexpressed in lung cancer cells, where it activates STAT3 signaling upon myristoylation, promoting accelerated proliferation of lung cancer cells [112]. However, knocking down EZH2 using specific inhibitors can inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation while enhancing chemosensitivity to cisplatin [113]. EZH2 also directly binds to regulatory promoters, modulating gene expression. For instance, the PUMA (p53 upregulating regulator of apoptosis) promoter is conjugated by EZH2, and its expression is induced when EZH2 is inhibited, leading to increased sensitivity of NSCLC to cisplatin [114]. EZH2 can serve as a potential biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as its overexpression is associated with poor outcomes in NSCLC patients [115]. In addition, cfDNA epiomics analysis showed that H3K4me3 upregulation and promoter hypomethylation synergistically activate oncogenes (such as CAV2 and PRKCI) in lung cancer, which can be used for early detection (sensitivity 95.1%) [116]. Also found that H3K27me3 modification affects NER and HR leading to chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that it also plays a driving role in drug resistance [117]. For example, SLFN11, which plays a role in DNA damage repair, is silenced in multiple chemoresistance models, and its silencing is associated with increased deposition of H3K27me3 catalyzed by EZH2. And, the addition of EZH2 inhibitors has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of lung cancer to chemotherapy [118]. Additionally, LINC00665 can recruit EZH2 into the promoter of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 C (CDKN1C), promoting H3K27 demethylation and transcriptional repression, thereby exerting its tumorigenic effects and reducing sensitivity to cisplatin [119].

Histone acetylation is another vital epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression, primarily mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which work in opposing directions [120]. Aberrant expression of HATs and HDACs has been implicated in tumor initiation and progression [121]. Gene expression affected by histone acetylation can influence the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. For example, overexpression of the excision repair cross-complementation 1 (ERCC1) gene has been shown to promote cisplatin resistance. However, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can resensitize NSCLC cells with high ERCC1 expression to cisplatin. This occurs because HDACis induce miR-149 expression through acetylation and activation of E2F1, while inhibition of miR-149 reverses the DNA damage and apoptosis of NSCLC cells with cisplatin-induced ERCC1 overexpression by HDACis. Additionally, E2F1 can directly target ERCC1 and inhibit its expression [122]. PD-L1 is an immunosuppressive factor, and increased expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells has been linked to acquired chemoresistance [123]. PD-L1 expression is significantly elevated in cisplatin-resistant tissues and cell lines in NSCLC. This increase is associated with enhanced histone H3 acetylation of the PD-L1 promoter by the COP1/c-Jun/HDAC3 axis [124].

These findings highlight the potential of targeting histone modifications to overcome cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Future research should focus on developing specific inhibitors and exploring combination therapies to enhance patient outcomes.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, one of the most common RNA modifications, occurs through the METTL3/METTL14 methyltransferase complex and influences RNA stability and translation efficiency [125]. This modification is implicated in the onset and progression of various human cancers [126]. For example, m6A is highly enriched in mitochondrial RNA-processing endonuclease (RMRP) and enhances its RNA stability. This is mediated by m6A RNA methylation, which promotes the proliferation and progression of NSCLC by modulating the TGFBR1/SMAD2/SMAD3 pathway [127].

M6A methylation has a potential association with cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. Overexpression of miR-4443, a tissue-derived exosome of cisplatin-resistant NSCLC, promotes cisplatin resistance by inhibiting cisplatin-induced FSP1-mediated ferroptosis [128]. The mechanism involved is that miR-4443 regulates the expression of FSP1 in an m6A-dependent manner through its direct target gene METTL3. In NSCLC, the methyltransferase METTL3 is frequently upregulated, enhancing the stability and translational efficiency of multiple drug resistance-related mRNAs. Specifically, METTL3 overexpression in lung cancer tissues and cells mediates m6A methylation of YAP mRNA, which recruits YTHDF1/3 and eIF3b to the translation initiation complex to promote YAP protein synthesis. Concurrently, METTL3 stabilizes YAP mRNA through the MALAT1-miR-1914-3p-YAP axis [129]. These coordinated mechanisms lead to increased YAP expression and activity, ultimately driving NSCLC chemoresistance and metastasis.

Demethylases (“Erasers”) also contribute to drug resistance. For example, in KRAS-mutant NSCLC, KRAS activation suppresses ALKBH5 demethylase activity through the ERK/JNK signaling pathway, leading to elevated m6A levels. This enhances the stability of DDB2 and XPC mRNAs, thereby promoting NER and driving cisplatin resistance. Additionally, m6A-modified RNAs recruit reader proteins (e.g., IGF2BP1), which stabilize target transcripts by interacting with RNA-binding proteins such as ELAVL1 [130]. Specifically, m6A-dependent stabilization of SNRPA mRNA facilitates exon 8 skipping in ERCC1 pre-mRNA, generating the ERCC1-E8 (+) splice variant. This isoform forms the ERCC1-XPF heterodimer, a critical mediator of DNA damage repair, ultimately conferring cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma [131].

The association between m6A modification and cisplatin resistance is primarily mediated by methyltransferases, demethylases, and reader proteins. These regulators modulate m6A levels to enhance the stability and translational efficiency of drug resistance-related RNAs.

Emerging research has established the critical role of epigenetic modifications in cisplatin resistance, though clinical translation remains in its nascent stages. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are closely associated with cisplatin resistance, making DNA methylation modulation a promising therapeutic strategy. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as decitabine (DAC)—currently approved for hematologic malignancies—demonstrate significant potential in NSCLC treatment and resistance reversal. In vitro studies indicate that low-dose 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine combined with trichostatin A (TSA) can restore cisplatin sensitivity in A549/DDP cells. Furthermore, synergistic effects have been observed when DNMTis (e.g., azacitidine, AZA) are co-administered with cisplatin, significantly enhancing apoptosis in resistant NSCLC cells. While DNMTis for cisplatin resistance remain in preclinical investigation, their clinical applications in NSCLC are being actively explored, including CC-486 (oral azacitidine) combined with HDAC inhibitors (e.g., entinostat) in advanced NSCLC, though this regimen is associated with adverse effects such as injection-site reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperglycemia [132]. A randomized phase II trial (NCT02250326) comparing nab-paclitaxel ± CC-486 in advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients showed no survival benefit with the combination therapy (P> 0.05) [133]. Ongoing clinical studies (e.g., ChiCTR2400089355) are evaluating ctDNA methylation profiling to dynamically monitor treatment response and detect resistance earlier than conventional serum biomarkers in advanced NSCLC.

Alterations in histone chemical modifications contribute to cisplatin resistance, with histone-targeting epigenetic modulators demonstrating therapeutic promise. Aberrant expression of histone methyltransferases and demethylases is observed in lung cancer, exemplified by EZH2 overexpression. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 enhances cisplatin sensitivity by directly binding to gene promoters and modulating transcriptional regulation. Clinical evidence correlates EZH2 overexpression with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Specific inhibitors (GSK126, DZNep) improve the sensitivity of BRG1/EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to topoisomerase II inhibitors like etoposide, establishing a preclinical foundation for EZH2-targeted therapies [134].

Similarly, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) resensitize NSCLC cells to cisplatin through multigene regulation. For instance, Vorinostat (a small-molecule HDACi) potentiates carboplatin/paclitaxel efficacy by inducing γ-H2AX (a DNA damage marker) and increasing α-tubulin acetylation (linked to microtubule stabilization). A phase II trial (NCT00481078) showed improved response rates with vorinostat combination therapy (34% vs. 12%,P= 0.02) but also higher grade 4 thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 3%) and two fatal adverse events, with no survival benefit [135].

Specific miRNAs (e.g., miR-29c, miR-204) augment cisplatin sensitivity by suppressing the PI3K/AKT and CAV1/AKT pathways. Although the MRX34 (miR-34a liposomal injection) phase I trial (NCT01829971) was terminated early due to immune toxicity, it validated the clinical feasibility of noncoding RNAs modulation. Developing safer delivery systems (e.g., exosomes, lipid nanoparticles) for resistance-related noncoding RNAs could advance targeted therapy in precision oncology.

While these trials have demonstrated that some epigenetic inhibitors, either in combination with chemotherapy or used alone, may offer new therapeutic strategies for lung cancer treatment. However, it still faces many challenges in clinical translation. First, these drugs often have dose-related toxicities, such as bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal discomfort, and liver impairment, limiting their clinical tolerability and the possibility of sustainable treatment. For example, myelosuppression, as the main dose-limiting toxicity of DNMTis, was administered sequentially in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of urothelial carcinoma and GCSF was effective in preventing neutropenia, and the results showed that it was tolerable despite some additional myelosuppressive effects [136]. This provides a reference for lung cancer-related treatment. Moreover, there is currently a lack of effective biomarkers to screen patients sensitive to epigenetic treatment, which can lead to highly variable clinical trial results and unpredictable treatment response. In addition, epigenetic high plasticity is affected by tumor heterogeneity, reducing the efficacy of epigenetic inhibitors. For example, alterations in HDAC expression are more common in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and this heterogeneity of tumor cells may attenuate the therapeutic effect of HDACis, limiting its suitability in malignancies characterized by specific expression [137]. This has led to a deep reflection: whether it is possible to detect the relevant epigenetic genes of abnormal states for patient screening before using relevant drugs. When using inhibitors and related drugs, attention should be paid to dose adjustment and indication screening, and even targeted delivery in liposomal nanoparticles should be considered. In combination therapy, it is crucial to maintain time coherence and monitor the treatment effect dynamically. In addition, the development of highly sensitive biomarkers and the application of CRISPR epigenetic editing technology may be beneficial to enhance drug sensitivity.

And it was found that different subtypes of NSCLC also showed differences in DNA methylation patterns, epigenetic regulation mechanisms, and chemotherapy resistance mechanisms. Significant differences in gene mutations (e.g., EGFR, KRAS vs. SOX2, TP63) and molecular background between LUAD and LUSC affect epigenetic regulatory pathways [138]. Moreover, large-scale methylation analysis showed that multiple DNA repair genes (such as MLH1, MSH2, and BRCA1) in NSCLC exhibited differential hypermethylation patterns in the promoter region in different isotypes [139]. Hypermethylation and silencing of common tumor suppressor genes in LUAD, such as RASSF1A, are closely related to increased drug resistance, while LUSC exhibits more prevalent chromatin remodeling abnormalities in the genome, suggesting that its epigenetic regulatory mechanism is different from that of LUAD [46]. Again, miRNA expression profiles differ significantly between the two isotypes. Classical studies have shown that miRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-205, etc.) are expressed differently in LUAD versus LUSC, reflecting the specificity of epigenetic regulation [140]. In addition, although some signaling pathways in lung cancer, especially NSCLC, share some mechanisms with other cancers, they may exhibit some unique details in epigenetic regulation in the specific context of lung cancer. For example, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is more central in NSCLC, is often abnormally activated, with an activation mutation rate of PIK3CA (encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit p110α) of about 2–5%, while the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (negatively regulated PI3K/AKT) is absent or apparently silenced in about 8% of NSCLC, resulting in continued activation of AKT [141]. This aberrant activation is closely related to drug resistance, and it is particularly involved in miRNA regulation imbalances in epigenetic regulation. On the one hand. miR-204 reduces cisplatin resistance in NSCLC by inhibiting the caveolin-1/AKT/Bad pathway miR‑204. On the other hand, upregulation of miR-25-3p negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway by downregulating PTEN release, leading to enhanced AKT activity and promoting the formation of a more significant cisplatin-resistant phenotype in NSCLC cells in vitro and in vitro experiments [142]. These findings suggest that when studying the relationship between epigenetic regulation and cisplatin resistance, it is necessary to consider both the tumor heterogeneity of NSCLC subtypes and the complexity of signaling pathway regulation, which may more accurately identify drug resistance mechanisms and promote the development of precision treatment strategies.

Extensive studies have demonstrated that epigenetic modifications, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNA regulation, play a pivotal role in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. These findings have accelerated the development of novel biomarkers. For instance, noncoding RNAs such as MALAT1, circPTK1, and miR-29c exhibit altered expression levels in body fluids, exosomes, or tumor tissues, demonstrating strong correlations with cisplatin response and patient prognosis. These molecules hold great potential as liquid biopsy biomarkers for real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.

Furthermore, epigenetic inhibitors, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis, e.g., azacitidine [AzaC] and decitabine [AzadC]) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis, e.g., vorinostat), have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical studies. These agents not only enhance cisplatin sensitivity but also exhibit synergistic effects when combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, offering new therapeutic strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance. However, their clinical efficacy, toxicity, and side effects remain significant challenges that cannot be overlooked.

Emerging technologies are also opening new avenues for breakthroughs in this field. Recent advances in CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools (e.g., CRISPR/dCas9-DNMT/TET and CRISPR/dCas13) enable precise modulation of gene promoter methylation or RNA targeting, demonstrating remarkable potential in reversing drug-resistant phenotypes. For example, the CRISPR/dCas9-TET1 system has been successfully employed to demethylate the NNT promoter, restoring its expression and resensitizing resistant cancer cells to cisplatin. These breakthroughs suggest that precision epigenetic editing may serve as a key platform for personalized epigenetic therapy in the future.

Although the role of epigenetic mechanisms in cisplatin resistance has received widespread attention, the clinical translation of epigenetic therapy still faces significant challenges. First, epigenetic drugs lack high specificity, which may lead to off-target effects and systemic toxicity. Also, there is no uniform and reliable biomarker for screening beneficiary patients. In addition, the complex heterogeneity of solid tumors also makes epigenetic treatment effects variable. Therefore, future research should focus on the development of liquid biopsy markers to monitor the evolution of drug resistance, and the application prospects of precise epigenetic editing technologies such as CRISPR/dCas9 in lung cancer.
