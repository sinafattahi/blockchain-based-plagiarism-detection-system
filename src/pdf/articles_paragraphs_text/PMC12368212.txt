Entamoeba histolytica, an anaerobic protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of amoebiasis, bloody diarrhea, and liver abscesses in humans. Amoebiasis is more predominant in tropical areas with poor sanitation conditions, and it remains the fourth leading cause of death due to a protozoan infection.E. histolyticalife cycle spans between an infective ‘cyst stage’ and an active disease-causing ‘trophozoite stage’. We have isolated ribosomes from the trophozoite stage ofE. histolytica. Here, we report single particle cryo-EM structures of the 53S ribosome large subunit (LSU), and 75S associated ribosomes, with P-tRNA, A/P and P/E tRNAs, and with paromomycin antibiotic, at 2.8 Å to 3.4 Å resolution. TheE. histolyticapossesses a reduced ribosome with a conserved core, and the periphery evolved with species-specific unique features. The most notable features are the presence of the rRNA triple helix near the peptide exit tunnel, the expansion segment H88ES102 near the exit site on LSU, and unique insertions in r-proteins. Furthermore, the 75S ribosome paromomycin complex structure provides the atomic details of its interactions. These structures provide insights into the evolutionary adaptation of theE. histolyticatranslational machinery and may be explored further for amoebicidal therapeutic intervention.

Entamoeba histolyticacauses bloody diarrhea and liver abscesses in humans. Here, the authors report the cryo-EM structure ofE. histolyticaribosomes from its disease-causing, trophozoite state and reveal several unique features, such as the rRNA triple helix motif.

Entamoeba histolytica, as its name suggests (histo-lytic = tissue destroyer), is an anaerobic parasite responsible for intestinal infection that results in bloody diarrhea, known as invasive amoebiasis or invasive colitis1. Occasionally, the parasite reaches into the bloodstream and spreads through the body, most frequently ending up in the liver, where it causes liver abscesses. Rarely, it reaches the lung, brain, and spleen and causes abscesses, which can be fatal if untreated1–3.E. histolyticainfects ~35–50 million people worldwide and roughly kills 55,000 people each year (https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/amebiasis/index.html)4. The life cycle ofE. histolyticaspans the active disease-causing “trophozoite stage,” which exists only in the host, and the infective “cyst stage,” which survives outside the host. Infection occurs mainly via ingesting mature cyst from fecally contaminated food, water, or hands4.

Earlier studies showed that ribosomes fromEntamoeba invadens, a non-pathogenic model organism forE. histolytica, assemble in a rod-shaped helical structure known as chromatoid bodies during the cyst stage5–9. In contrast, its trophozoite stage contains typical ribosomes having monosomes, ribosomal large subunit (LSU), and ribosomal small subunit (SSU)10.E. histolyticapossesses a reduced ribosome as its monosome, LSU, and SSU, which sediments at 75S, 53S, and 36S, respectively (S—Svedberg unit)11and their respective rRNA sediments at 25S, 17S, 5.8S, 5S, and 4S12. Conversely, human ribosomes monosome, LSU, and SSU sediments, at the 80S, 60S, and 40S, respectively, and possess four rRNA species 28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S13,14. Whereas the bacterial ribosome, monosome, LSU, and SSU sediments at the 70S, 50S, and 30S, respectively, and their rRNAs are 23S, 16S, and 5S14.

Protein synthesis inEntamoebatrophozoites was first reported by Carter et al.15. The purified ribosomes form helices of the cyst, and polysomes from growing trophozoites appeared identical16. However, the crude cyst extract was inefficient in protein synthesis, and it became efficient only after adding the soluble fractions from trophozoites16. Emetine was introduced as an amoebicidal drug that binds to theE. histolyticaribosome and inhibits protein synthesis17,18. However, within two decades,E. histolyticamutants resistant to emetine were also reported19. Currently, ribosome-targeting aminoglycoside antibiotic “paromomycin” and other drugs are used as amoebicidal20,21. The high-resolution ribosome structures from other protozoans22–29have revealed the species-specific unique features of their architecture and protein synthesis. The atomic details forE. histolyticaribosome architecture are absent, as no structure is available.

Here, we report the single particle cryo-EM structures ofE. histolytica53S, ribosome large subunit, at 2.8 Å resolution, 75S translating ribosome with bound tRNA at P-site, 75S with bound tRNAs at A/P- and P/E-sites, and 75S with bound paromomycin antibiotic and tRNAs at A/P- and P/E-sites. All the ribosome structures are reported at 3.0–3.4 Å resolutions. These structures reveal several unique features specific toE. histolyticaribosome architecture, such as the rRNA triple helix motif, expansion segment defined as H88ES102, and unique insertion in r-proteins. Further, the structure of 75S with bound paromomycin provided an atomic illustration of its binding pocket.

The E. histolyticaribosomes purified through sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC) showed three prominent peaks (Supplementary Fig.1a). The fractions analyzed on 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide showed two prominent bands, suggesting that it contains ribosomal RNA (rRNA), most likely corresponding to the 25S and 17S rRNAs (Supplementary Fig.1a), fractions corresponding to the peaks P1, P2, and P3 (Supplementary Fig.1a), analyzed through negative staining electron microscopy, clearly showed that peak P1 contains irregular shape and size particles (Supplementary Fig.1b), which might be degraded ribosomes. Peak P2 contains a ribosomal large subunit (LSU) like particle, which is 53S inEntamoeba11(Supplementary Fig.1c). Peak P3 contains the associated ribosome like particles (Supplementary Fig.1d), which is 75S inEntamoeba11, and small helical segments were also visible (Supplementary Fig.1d), which might be fragments of helical ribosomal assemblies, observed earlier by Morgan & Uzman6, Further, peak P2 sample screening in cryo-EM conditions showed a uniform ribosomal distribution with optimum ice thickness (Supplementary Fig.1e), suggesting the samples are ideal for high-resolution cryo-EM data collection.

For ribosomal large subunit (LSU), the single particle reconstruction performed using RELION 3.1.4 has yielded an overall 2.8 Å resolution cryo-EM map from finally selected 378,061 particles (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig.2and Supplementary Table1). The local resolution calculated using RELION showed that the core of the ribosomal LSU has a resolution of up to 2.5 Å, whereas the surface has nearly 4.5 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig.2). The cryo-EM map clearly shows the high-resolution features, such as resolved r-protein alpha helices and rRNA double helices (Fig.1a, e, Supplementary Fig.2, Supplementary Movie1). Remarkably, we could clearly see the rRNA triple helix motif in the LSU cryo-EM map, which is located near the peptide exit tunnel (PET) (Fig.1a). The rRNA triple helix is composed of three helices, two parallel and one antiparallel helix. The three nucleotides are on the same plane. The nucleotide bases of the middle helix that have purine nucleotide interact through Watson and Crick base pairing (–) with the nucleotide bases of one of the helices, forming a classical double helical structure. The third helix’s nucleotides interact with the double helix’s major groove through Hoogsteen base pairing (•). Therefore, it is a major groove RNA triple helix. Four such nucleotide triplets U3326–A3414•U3311, U3325–A3425•U3312, U3324–A3426•U3313, and C3323–G3417•U3314 constitutes the triple helix architecture (Fig.1b–d, Supplementary Movie1).

An animation is shown in Supplementary Movie1.eFour base triples that constitute the triple helix are shown in the sticks, and cryo-EM density is shown on the surface with 85% transparency.

Some of the high-resolution features similar to the large subunit cryo-EM map (Fig.1) were also visible in the 75S ribosome cryo-EM map (Figs.2and3and Supplementary Figs.3–5). The 75S ribosome showed the presence of mRNA, nascent peptide, and bound tRNAs at P-site in one class and A/P and P/E-sites in another class (Figs.2and3, and Supplementary Figs.3–5, Supplementary Movies2and3), suggesting that these translation factors were co-purified during ribosome purification andE. histolyticaribosomes were in an active translating state.

The LSU cryo-EM map at 2.8 Å resolution and 75S ribosome bound with P-tRNA focused refinement maps at 3.0–3.4 Å resolution were used for initial model building. The cryo-EM maps of 75S clearly showed two extra densities, one adjacent to H88 and another at the 3′ end of 25S rRNA after modeling the annotated 25S rRNA sequence 3459 nucleotides (nt) long in the NCBI database (GenBank:BDEQ01000001.1). We could unambiguously build nearly 70 nt in H88 and 44 extra nt at the 3′ end (Supplementary Fig.6). The extra nt in H88 appears to be anE. histolytica-specific expansion segment situated near the L1 stalk and E-site of the LSU, and therefore, we named it H88ES102 (Figs.2and4, Supplementary Fig.7). We have reannotated the length of 25S rRNA to 3504 nt long after building 44 extra nt at the 3′ end.

D0 (Sandy brown), DI (purple dark), DII (blue), DIII (purple light), DIV (yellow), DV (pink), DVI (green), 5.8S (sienna), and 5S (light green) are shown and labeled with a Roman number. The rRNA that could not be modeled is shown in gray. Secondary structures were drawn using the R2DT tool from RNA Central and Adobe Illustrator, and human templates were obtained for comparison fromhttp://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RibosomeGallery/index.html. A detailed 2D diagram for 25S is provided in Supplementary Fig.7, and rRNA nt building details are provided in Supplementary Table2.b,cComparative analysis ofE. histolytica25S rRNA with the human 28S rRNA (PDB ID: 4UG013). Conserved regions are shown in a color similar to that of (a). The rRNA helices present in humans, which are either missing or disordered inE. histolytica, are shown in dark gray. The triple helix and H88ES102 are also labeled. A comparison of individualE. histolytica25S rRNA domains with the human 28S rRNA domains (gray) (PDB ID: 4UG013) is provided in Supplementary Fig.9a.

Approximately 90.26% of 25S nt (3163 nt out of 3504 nt), 92.9% of 5.8S nt (144 nt out of 155 nt), and 100% 5S nt (117 nt) of LSU rRNAs were modeled in the cryo-EM map (Fig.4, Supplementary Fig.7and Supplementary Table2). Similarly, 74.06% of 17S nt (1442 nt out of 1947 nt) was modeled for SSU rRNA in cryo-EM map (Fig.5, Supplementary Fig.8and Supplementary Table3). Overall,E. histolyticarRNA retains a conserved core and an altered surface (Figs.4b, cand5b, c, Supplementary Fig.9and Supplementary Tables2and3). The cryo-EM maps did not show any extra density that could be attributed to the 4S rRNA, as observed previously12; maybe its binding is highly dynamic.

The secondary structures were drawn using the R2DT tool from RNA Central and Adobe Illustrator, and human templates for comparison were obtained from the RiboVision suite (http://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RiboVision). A detailed 2D diagram for 25S is provided in Supplementary Fig.8, and statistics in Supplementary Table3.b,cComparisons ofE. histolytica17S rRNA with the human 18S rRNA (PDB ID: 4UG013). Regions either missing or disordered in 17S rRNA are shown in dark gray; other color schemes are similar to (a). A detailed comparison of individual domains is provided in Supplementary Fig.9b.

We were able to build 40 LSU and 31 SSU r-proteins using the focused refinement cryo-EM maps for LSU, SSU body, and SSU head of 75S ribosome with bound P-tRNA and LSU map of individual subunit (Fig.2, Supplementary Figs.10–13, Supplementary Tables2and3). High-resolution features in our cryo-EM maps allow us to assign the correct isoform for r-protein (Supplementary Figs.10–12) and to build r-protein extensions/insertions (Supplementary Fig.13). There were discrepancies in the annotations of ribosomal protein in the whole genome sequence available at NCBI with GENBANK ID:BDEQ01000001.1(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BDEQ01000001.1). Such as protein eL13 has six protein IDs, and uL13 has one protein ID. Sequence alignment showed that four IDs annotated to eL13, out of the six IDs, show similarity to the uL13 r-protein. Thus, these IDs were misannotated as eL13 (Supplementary Fig.10). The genome database does not annotate any protein ID for eL22 and eL29. However, after a sequence search, human eL22 and eL29 showed significant sequence identity withE. histolyticaprotein IDs EHI_141940, EHI_023220, respectively. Further, our cryo-EM maps clearly showed density that could be attributed to these two proteins (Fig.2a–d). The eL29 is shorter (64 aa) and shares only 33% identity with its human (122 aa) counterpart. Similarly, the SSU r-protein eS8 and RACK1 were not annotated in theE. histolyticagenome database. Based on sequence similarity with human counterpart and cryo-EM density in our map, we could assign the protein IDsGAT98092andGAT91985to eS8 and RACK1E. histolyticar-proteins, respectively (Fig.2a–d).

The LSU ofE. histolyticaconsists of 25S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs with 3504, 155, and 117 nt in length, respectively12(Fig.4a, Supplementary Fig.7, Supplementary Table2). Its human counterpart has elaborate rRNAs, 28S, 5.8S, and 5S, with 5070, 157, and 121 nt in length, respectively (Supplementary Table4)13. On comparing both, the overall architecture of the rRNA core is conserved, whereas the surface helices are reduced compared to their human counterpart (Fig.4b, c, Supplementary Fig.9a). TheE. histolytica25S rRNA can be subdivided into the domain system adopted for human 28S rRNA (http://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RibosomeGallery/index.html)30,31, which comprises of conserved core termed as domain 0, along with six other domains (DI to DVI) (Supplementary Table4).

Domain I of the 25S rRNA inE. histolytica, consisting of 1–769 nt, is shorter than the human counterpart, which is 1313 nt long (Supplementary Table4). The difference in length is primarily due to the absence of ESs, H25ES7d, e, f, g, h, and the shortening of ESs, H25ES7a and b, which are ~96 nt long inE. histolyticaas compared to ~245 nt in humans (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a). The ES H25ES7c is shorter and adopts a different conformation than its human counterpart. The 25S rRNA H15 remains partially disordered in our cryo-EM maps, which is longer (87 nt) inE. histolyticacompared to the 28S rRNA of the human ribosome (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a).

Domain II of the 25S rRNA inE. histolyticais from 794 to 1566 nt (772 nt long), which is 257 nt shorter than human Domain II (from 1317 to 2346 nt) (Supplementary Table4), and adopts a similar conformation. The ESs, 30ES9, 31ES9a, 45ES15, and 45ES15a are absent altogether, whereas H45, 30ES9, and H31are truncated inE. histolyticacompared to human counterparts (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a).

Domain III comprises 1587–2079 nt (492 nt in length) inE. histolytica,25S rRNA. This domain is ~33 nt longer than the domain III in human 28S rRNA, which is 459 nt in length (Supplementary Table4). The longer size can be attributed to the longer H54ES20a, H55, and H47, whereas the H54ES20a and H55 remain partially disordered in our cryo-EM maps (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a).

Domain IV spans from 2110 to 2408 nt (298 nt in length), which is drastically reduced inE. histolytica25S rRNA compared to 977 nt long in its human (Supplementary Table4). This domain is mainly composed of H63 and its expansion segment ES27. The enormous difference in size is due to the absence of 668 nt, constituting two major expansion segments 63ES27a and b (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a). These ESs, 63ES27a and b, have been known to play a crucial role in recruiting factors at the peptide exit tunnel and ribosome assembly32–34,and their deletion is lethal in higher eukaryotes32.

Domain V, which harbors the peptidyl transferase center (PTC)35, spans from 2476 to 3121 nt (645 nt long) (Supplementary Table4) and has a conserved PTC region. Although it has a similar nt number (654 nt in humans), it shows significant alterations in the L1 stalk region. The L1 stalk region is composed of H76, H77, and H78, which are disordered in our map, whereas the constituting ESs (ES30 and ES30a) are absent inE. histolyticarRNA. The r-protein, uL1, also remains disordered in our cryo-EM maps. The H79 and its ESs, ES31, ES31a, and ES31b, are shorter compared to their human counterpart (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a). The H88 possesses a 70 nt longE. histolytica-specific ES, H88ES102 (Figs.2and4, Supplementary Figs.7and9a), and makes a unique interaction with the insertion segment of eL13 r-protein (Fig.2c, d). The H88ES102 region remains disordered in our 53S LSU cryo-EM map, suggesting it gets ordered only after 75S formation. Recently, it has been suggested that the H88 plays a role in phase 2 of the 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis, the assembly of the central protuberance (CP). H88 and the L1 stalk provide two nucleation sites for the compaction and assembly of the rRNAs H80-H87, and are involved in forming CP and 5S RNP36. Whether theE. histolyticaH88 expansion H88ES102 has any role in modulating the CP assembly remains to be investigated.

Domain VI ofE. histolyticacomprises 3146 to 3504 nt (358 nt long), shorter than the human domain VI (497 nt long) (Supplementary Table4). The reduction in length is mainly due to reduced H98 and H101 and their compact expansion segments, 98ES39, 98ES39a, 98ES39b, and 101ES41 (Fig.4, Supplementary Fig.7,9a). The H98 adopts a different conformation inE. histolytica25S rRNA, which leads to a unique rRNA motif formation, the triple helix rRNA motif (Fig.4c, Supplementary Fig.9a). The 5.8S and 5S are mostly conserved, with 155 nt and 117 nt in length, respectively. (Fig.4a, Supplementary Fig.7).

Similar to LSU 25S rRNA, the overall architecture of theE. histolyticaSSU rRNA has a conserved core region (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.8and9b). The peripheral helices are either missing or reduced in length compared to their human counterpart (Fig.5b, cSupplementary Fig.9b). The SSU rRNA is 17S12, and consists of 1947 nt. In contrast, humans have 18S rRNA, which has a length of 1869 nt (Supplementary Table4). The 17S rRNA is also made up of four domains: 5′ domain (5′), central (C) domain, 3′ major (3′M) domain, and 3′ minor (3′m) domain (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.S8andS9b). The 5′ domain spans from 1 to 602 nt, shorter than its human (658 nt long) counterpart (Supplementary Table4), mainly because of missing expansion segments, h9es3c and b. Meanwhile, h16 and h17 remain disordered in our cryo-EM map (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.S8andS9b). The 17S rRNA, C domain consists from 603 to 1162 nt (559 nt long), which is longer inE. histolyticacompared to humans (534 nt long) 18S rRNA (Supplementary Table4), mainly because of an insertion in surface helices 21es6c and 26es7, which remains disordered in our cryo-EM map. The 21es6b, which is shorter in 17S rRNA, also remains a disorder. The 3′M domain comprises 1171–1801 nt (630 nt in length) of 17S rRNA, which is exceptionally longer than humans (497 nt long) 18S rRNA (Supplementary Table4). The longer length is mainly attributed to ESs present in h39, h40, and h41es10, which remain partially disordered in our cryo-EM map (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.8and9b). The 3′m domain encompasses from 1802 to 1947 nt (145 nt in length) and is shorter than its human (169 nt long) counterpart (Supplementary Table4). The shorter length is mainly because of h44, the major helix in the 3′m domain, which remains partially disordered in our cryo-EM maps (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.8and9b). The 3′ M and 3′m are domains that constitute the decoding center on the SSU, where codon and anticodon interaction takes place during protein synthesis37, retaining a conserved core with alteration in surface helices inE. histolytica.

The ribosomal catalytic sites, the decoding center33,the peptidyl transferase center, and the polypeptide exit tunnel35are highly conserved inE. histolytica. The tRNA binding sites, A-, P- and E-sites on both the subunits are also conserved (Figs.2and3) with minor variations, particularly in the r-proteins; uS13, uS19, eS25, uL16, and eL42, which constitute the tRNA binding sites (Supplementary Fig.14). Although the core of these proteins is conserved, the terminal end remains disordered compared to their human counterparts (Supplementary Fig.15), even in the tRNA-bound state (Supplementary Fig.14). Interestingly, the loop region of the uL16, which interacts with the acceptor arm of the P-tRNA adopts a slightly different conformation and remains partially disordered in bothE. histolyticaand humans despite having the same amino acid sequence (Supplementary Fig.15d). C-terminus of eL42 is slightly shorter inE. histolyticathan in humans (Supplementary Fig.15e).

E. histolyticar-protein possesses overall conserved domains compared to its human counterpart, with deletions and insertions/extensions in a few r-proteins (Supplementary Fig.13). The uL3, uL18, eL6, eL14, eL29, eL37 and eS17 are truncated, whereas uL4, eL9, eL13 eL18 eL20, uL24, eL31, uS3, eS19, and eS21 carriesE. histolytica-specific insertions/extensions (Supplementary Fig.13). The cryo-EM density for these extensions/insertions were evident in the map (Fig.2a–d). We could build these extensions/insertions (Supplementary Fig.13). Intriguingly, uL24 ofE. histolytica, which has a nearly ~80 amino acid long insertion, occupies the position of the human eL28 protein. The eL28 is absent inE. histolyticabut present in humans (Supplementary Fig.16a). The uL24 extension appears specific toE. histolyticaas it  is shorter in other eukaryotes and protozoa (Supplementary Fig.16b). Similarly, a ~90 amino acid residue insertion in the eL13 seems species-specific (Supplementary Fig.17a) and is absent in other eukaryotes and protozoa (Supplementary Fig.17b).

TheE. histolyticar-proteins, eL6, eS8, and uS17 loops adopt a slightly different conformation, despite sharing a conserved domain with humans (Supplementary Fig.18). The uL10, uL11, eL28, eS31, and eS32 present in human ribosomes are absent inE. histolytica. SomeEntamoeba-specific insertions/extensions in r-proteins, eS4, eS6, eS7, eS25, and eS26, could not be modeled in our cryo-EM map, maybe because of their flexible nature.

Intersubunit bridges at the interface side of the SSU and LSU27hold the ribosomal subunits together. The bridges were analyzed using Chimera X. The residues within a 4 Å distance at the interface side of LSU and SSU were selected. The intersubunit bridges were compared with those of human and another protozoan,Giardia lambliabridges13,27(Fig.6aand Supplementary Table5). We were able to analyze 13 bonafide bridges, whereas the bridge eB13 remains disordered in the 75S ribosome cryo-EM map. TheE. histolyticaribosome has retained most of the bacterial-like bridges, B1b/c, B2a, B2b, B2c, B2e, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7a, B7b/a, and B8, and also acquired a few eukaryotic-specific bridges, eB11, eB12. A notable difference was the distinct conformation of the C-terminus of uS17 (Supplementary Fig.18a), which makes a unique interaction with eL19 r-protein near bridge eB12. This interaction appears to beE. histolytica-specific; therefore, we have named this an eB12a bridge. The eS32 protein is absent inE. histolytica;consequently, the bridge eB14 is missing. The bridge B1a, eB8, and eB13 could not be observed because the interacting residues remain disordered in our cryo-EM map.

aThe ribosomal small subunit (left) and large subunit (right) are shown in light khaki and blue, respectively. The residues involved in intersubunit bridges are shown in the atomic sphere, and bridges are labeled. The bridges shown in gray color were not observed in the 75S ribosome. A detail of interacting residues is provided in Supplementary Table5.bThe LSU coordinates built using 75S cryo-EM maps (light blue) docked into the LSU Cryo-EM map (gray) are shown. The rRNA helices that become ordered upon association with the SSU are labeled.

Docking the LSU coordinates built in the 75S ribosome cryo-EM into the 2.8 Å cryo-EM map of the LSU alone, showed that the rRNA helices, mainly on the interface side, become ordered upon association with SSU (Fig.6b). The most notable is theE. histolytica-specific surface ES H88ES102 and insertions in eL13, which become ordered upon association (Fig.7). Other rRNA helices, H34, H43, H44, H69, H76, H79ES31b, H84, H101 also become ordered in the 75S associated ribosome. The H34, H69, and H101 lead to the formation of intersubunit bridges B4, B2a, and eB11, respectively, upon association with SSU (Fig.6a).

TheE. histolyticaLSU is shown on the solvent side in the middle, and regions of rRNA and r-protein co-evolution are zoomed and shown in the surrounding area in roughly matching orientation. The rRNA (blue) is shown in ribbon and surface view with 80% transparency. The r-proteins in the ribbon (light blue) and extension/insertion (red) are shown. Central perturbance (CP) and peptide exit tunnel (PET) are labeled. A circle that is 50% transparent shows the location of PET in LSU. A full 3D model of r-protein with extensions is provided in Supplementary Fig.13.

E. histolyticaribosomes have evolved with a conserved core and alterations mainly on the solvent-exposed surface. The co-evolution of r-protein and rRNA is a common feature observed earlier in the structure of eukaryotic ribosomes13,22,38,39. The r-proteins, such as uL4, uL9, eL13, eL18, eL20, uL24, and eL31, possess prominentE. histolytica-specific extensions/insertions in their sequences (Supplementary Fig.13). These are mainly localized on the solvent side surface of the LSU (Fig.7). On the other hand, the LSU 25S rRNA is compact and reduced in size compared to human 28S rRNA. The small size of 25S rRNA is mainly because some eukaryotic-specific expansion segments are missing (Fig.4b, c, Supplementary Fig.9a). To stabilize the reduced size of rRNA, which has opted a different conformation for surface helices,E. histolyticahas evolved with extensions, which contain mostly positively charged amino acid residues and mainly adopts α helical secondary structure (Fig.7). The rRNA helices sandwich these α helices, which are localized in the vicinity of the ribosomal surface (Fig.7). For example, uL4 extension sandwich between H25ES7b and H25ES7c, eL9 insertion interacts with H42. Most intriguingly, the eL13 extension is sandwiched between H18ES43 and H25ES7a, with theE. histolytica-specific helix H88ES102. Similarly, the uL24 extension sandwich between H45 and H46, and eL31 interacts with the H94, H99 and H98ES39b, which constitutes the rRNA triple helix, anE. histolytica-specific rRNA motif (Fig.7). In summary, it suggests that theE. histolyticaLSU rRNA helices and r-proteins have co-evolved to provide a compact and stable architecture, which might be crucial for its survival.

RNA triple helix, naturally found in biological machineries, plays a vital role and provides a catalytic scaffold, structural stability, metal binding site, etc.40,41. RNA triple helix is found in telomerase, an RNP enzyme that maintains the chromosome end, where RNA triple helix is crucial for its catalytic activity42. Spliceosome and Group II introns RNA triple helix coordinate the catalytic Mg2+ions during splicing43,44. In riboswitches, the RNA triple helix provides a ligand-binding scaffold45. It is also reported in humans that metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), which is endowed with a blunt end triple helix (no 3′overhang), inhibits the rapid phase of nuclear RNA decay and also upregulates translation46. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) adopts a triple RNA helix motif in lytic phage and protects its genome from decay47. However, there are no reports of rRNA adopting a triple helical conformation.

Interestingly, we found a distinctly visible cryo-EM density for a triple helix in theE. histolyticaLSU map (Figs.1a–eand4, Supplementary Fig.7,9a, Supplementary Movie1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an RNA triple helix present in ribosomal RNA. The triple helix is present in DVI, towards the 3′ end of 25S rRNA, on the surface, solvent side, of the LSU near the PET (Figs.4cand8, Supplementary Figs.7and9a). Compared with the human 28S rRNA, we observed thatE. histolytica3′ is shorter by 16 nt compared with its human counterpart (Fig.8). The human 28S rRNA 3′ position overlaps with theE. histolyticatriple helix position on 25S rRNA (Figs.4cand8, Supplementary Fig.9a). The other eukaryotes,Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand protozoans,Plasmodium falciparum,Leishmania donovani, andGiardia lamblia, also possess an extended 3′ end, and overall, a conserved architecture of domain VI to that of human rRNA domain VI (Supplementary Fig.19).

A comparative analysis of Domain VI is provided in Supplementary Fig.18.

As the 3′ end is a target site for 3′ to 5′ exonucleases, it is speculative to say thatE. histolyticahas remodeled its 25S rRNA by shortening its length and adopting a different conformation, the triple helix, to protect its rRNA from human 3′ to 5′ exonucleases. It will most likely be similar to what was reported earlier for KSHV47. However, it needs experimental evidence.

The cryo-EM single particle reconstruction yielded a final 3.2 Å resolution map after performing focused refinement of the SSU body (Supplementary Fig.5). We could clearly see the cryo-EM density that could be attributed to paromomycin (PAR), an aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotic (Fig.9and Supplementary Fig.5). The PAR binds to a conserved binding pocket, the major groove of h44 in the SSU body (Fig.9b–d), as earlier reported inE. coli48andLeishmania donovani24(Fig.10). PAR binding flips out the universally conserved residues A1902 and A1903 (A1492 and A1493 inE. colinumbering) (Figs.9c, eand10), which otherwise are flipped out only when there is a cognate codon-anticodon interaction at A-site of the decoding center. In normal situations, the flipped-out conformation of A1902 and A1903 (A1492 and A1493in E. colinumbering) stabilizes the cognate tRNA at the A-site and facilitates the correct tRNA selection49. In PAR-bound state, these two nucleotides, A1902 and A1903 (A1492 and A1493in E. colinumbering), remain flipped out permanently, thus facilitating the selection of both cognate and non-cognate (incorrect) tRNA at the A-site in the decoding center, leading to error-prone translation49. The PAR binding pocket is highly conserved, where ring 1 of PAR is involved in stacking interactions with G1901 (G1491 inE. colinumbering) and hydrogen bonds with G1901 and A1902. The ring II of PAR makes three hydrogen bonds with A1903, G1904, and U1905 (A1493, G1494, and U1495 inE. colinumbering), whereas ring III of PAR makes a single hydrogen bond with C1810 (G1407 inE. coli). The ring IV of PAR also makes a single hydrogen bond with G1808 (G1399 inE. colinumbering) (Figs.9e, fand10). The H69 of LSU and uS12 protein further stabilize the PAR binding pocket. The rRNA nucleotide modifications within the PAR binding pocket have been shown to play a role in stabilizing PAR binding24. However, we did not model any modifications in our cryo-EM map; thus, these observations could not be made. The PAR binding pocket is highly conserved inE. histolytica,L. donovani, andE. coli. In contrast, the corresponding pocket in humans is similar with a few notable differences (Fig.10). The base stacking interaction between ring I of PAR with G1901 (G1491 inE. coli) appears to be the major stabilizing interaction, where G1901 makes Watson Crick base pair with C1812 (C1409 inE. coli) and provides a stable platform for base stacking interaction with ring I of PAR. Whereas in humans, the corresponding residue A1823 adopts a slightly different conformation and does not base pair with the opposite strand nucleotide, which is C1710 (Fig.10). Therefore, in humans, the base stacking interaction would be disfavored upon PAR binding.

In summary, theE. histolyticaribosomes isolated from the disease-causing trophozoite stage using sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed prominent peaks corresponding to the 75S ribosome and its 53S large subunit. Single particle reconstruction and model building have elucidated the atomic details of the 53S and 7SS ribosomes with tRNAs, mRNA, and nascent peptide and revealedE. histolytica-specific features such as triple helix motif, H88ES102, and insertion/extensions in r-proteins. TheE. histolyticaretains a conserved core with modifications in solvent-exposed surface.E. histolyticamight have evolved with a triple RNA helix motif to protect its ribosome from host RNase attack. The cryo-EM structure of 75S ribosome in complex with paromomycin antibiotic has illustrated the atomic details of its binding pocket inE. histolytica. This study opens a new avenue to investigate protein synthesis inE. histolytica, which is vaguely understood, and to exploit the unique species-specific features of its translation machinery to design novel amoebicidal therapeutics.

Trophozoites ofE. histolyticastrain HM1: IMSS clone-6 were grown axenically in TYI-S-33 medium at 35 °C as described earlier by Diamond et al.50. To get a sufficient amount of ribosomes, the culture was expanded into a 75 cm2cell culture, plug seal flask (NEST) with 250 ml complete media following the earlier protocol by Gautam et al.51. In brief, TYI-S-33 media was prepared by mixing potassium phosphate dibasic 1.0 g, potassium phosphate monobasic 0.6 g, biosate peptone 30.0 g, glucose 10.0 g, sodium chloride 2.0 g, L-cysteine hydrochloride 1.0 g, ascorbic acid 1.0 g, and ferric ammonium citrate 22.8 mg in 700 ml of double distilled water and pH was adjusted to 6.8 using 5 N NaOH. The volume was made up to 900 ml (10 units) and filtered using a filter assembly (Corning 500 ml, filter system). The cells were grown in TYI-S-33 medium complemented with 15% adult bovine serum, 1X Diamond vitamin mix, 125 µl of 250 U/ml Benzylpenicillin, and 0.25 mg/ml Streptomycin per 90 ml of medium (complete media). After 60 h, the media was removed, and 1X Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS pH 7.4) was added to the confluent culture, chilled on ice for 7 min, and then harvested by centrifugation at 1200 ×gfor 7 min at 4 °C.

Ribosome isolation was done similarly, as reported previously in ref.52, with minor modifications. TheE. histolyticacells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM) HEPES-sodium salt buffer, pH 7.4, 40 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche), RNasin (Thermo,1:40 dilution) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell lysis was performed using Retsch Mixer Mill MM500 at 30 Hz, 1 min/cycle, and a total of 8 cycles. 2 U/ml DNase I (Thermo Scientific) was added to the cell lysate and incubated on ice for 45 min. The cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 18,626 ×gfor 45 min at 4 °C. The cleared cell lysate was layered on a 1.1 M sucrose cushion (20 mM HEPES-sodium salt buffer pH 7.4, 150 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1.1 M sucrose, 3 mM DTT) in equal volume, followed by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 ×gfor 16 h at 4 °C (Hitachi P70AT2 rotor). The pellet was then resuspended in buffer A (20 mM HEPES-sodium salt buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 3 mM DTT) and centrifuged at 18,626 ×g30 min, 4 °C. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 260 nm, and 10 OD units were layered on a 10%–50% sucrose gradient in gradient buffer (20 mM HEPES-sodium salt buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 3 mM DTT) prepared using Gradient Master from Biocomp Instruments. Gradients were centrifuged at 256,400 ×gfor 8 h at 4 °C (Hitachi, P40ST rotor). Afterward, the gradients were fractionated using a Gilson Fractionator from BioComp Instruments (Supplementary Fig.1). The fractions were then analyzed using 1% agarose gel with 0.06% bleach (Supplementary Fig.1). The fractions corresponding to peaks were then pooled and concentrated using 100 kDa cut-off amicon from Merck Millipore, followed by buffer exchange with ribosome storage buffer (20 mM HEPES-sodium salt buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 mM NH4OAc, 3 mM DTT). The concentration of the sample was determined by absorbance at 260 nm, and ribosomes were stored at −80 °C for future use.

The 300 mesh Copper grids with a thin carbon layer on the top (CF300-Cu) from Electron Microscopy Science (EMS) were glow-discharged for 50 s in a JEOL glow discharge unit. A 3 µl sample from peak 1(Supplementary Fig.1a) of sucrose gradient fractionation was applied on the grid’s carbon side and washed three times with Mili-Q water. The grid was stained with 1% uranyl acetate solution. The grids for peaks 2 and 3 (Supplementary Fig.1a) were prepared following a similar protocol. The grids were analyzed in a 120 kVa JEOL JEM1400 electron microscope at Advanced Technology Platform Centre (ATPC), Regional Centre for Biotechnology (RCB), Faridabad (Supplementary Fig.1b–d).

A 3 µl of 53S ribosome (1 µg/µl, peak 1) sample was applied to a quantifoil Cu 1.2/1.3 grids from Ted Pella, Inc. and plunge freeze using GATAN CP3 plunger after 3-s blotting at 4 °C temperature and 80% humidity. The cryo-EM grid was mounted in a GATAN 626 cryo-holder and analyzed using a JEOL JEM2200FS microscope equipped with a GATAN K2 summit direct electron detector camera at ATPC, RCB, Faridabad. At optimum ice thickness, the data were collected in a Movie mode at 1.649 e−/Å2/frame with 30 frames per Movie stack.

After initial cryo-EM condition optimization at ATPC, RCB, the final high-resolution data were collected at a 300 kVa Titan Krios microscope equipped with Falcon 3 direct electron detector camera (ThermoFisher) at the National Electron Cryo-Microscopy Facility, Bangalore Life Science Cluster (BLiSc), Bangalore. The data sets were collected in an electron integration Movie mode. For the 53S ribosomal subunit, 3470 Movie stacks were collected with 25 frames per Movie stack at 75,000× magnification with 1.07 Å pixel and an electron dose of 1.34 e-/Å2/frame in electron integration mode using a Falcon 3 electron detector camera (Supplementary Fig.2, Supplementary Table1). For 75S ribosome, 5724 Movie stacks (dataset 1) and 6116 Movie stacks (dataset 2) were collected in a similar setting as that of 53S ribosomal subunit data collection, with a similar electron dose of 1.34 e-/Å2/frame 75,000× magnification with 1.07 Å pixel (Supplementary Fig.3, Supplementary Table1).

The purified 75S ribosomes, stored at −80 °C, were thawed and spun at 20,000 ×gfor 10 min. 200 nM of 75S ribosomes were incubated with a 1000-time excess of PAR (0.2 mM) at 25 °C for 15 min and immediately used for EM analysis. Initial sample screening was performed by following steps similar to those of the associated 75S ribosome. The samples were screened at room temperature, negative staining using JEOL JEM1400 120 kVa electron microscope, and at cryo-condition using JEOL JEM2200FS 200 kVa electron microscope equipped with GATAN K2 camera at ATPC, RCB Faridabad. High-resolution cryo-EM data were collected using a 300 kVa Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon 3 direct electron detector camera (ThermoFisher) at the National Electron Cryo-Microscopy Facility, Bangalore Life Science Cluster (BLiSc), Bangalore. A total of 4,688 Movie stacks were collected with 32 frames per Movie stack at 75,000× magnification with 1.07 Å pixel with an electron dose of 1.09 e-/Å2/frame in electron integration mode using a Falcon 3 electron detector camera (Supplementary Fig.5, Supplementary Table1).

RELION 3.1.453was used for single particle reconstruction of all three, 53S, 75S and 75S-PAR, ribosome 3D reconstruction (Supplementary Figs.S2–S5, Supplementary Table1). The Movie stacks were drift corrected using RELION’s own implementation, and single micrographs were generated. The micrographs were CTF corrected using CTFFIND454. Initially, particles were picked manually, and 2D reference images were generated for automatic particle picking. 763,731 auto-picked particles for the 53S ribosomal subunit were subjected to 2D classification, and the best classes with 554,832 particles were selected for 3D classification. A 60 Å low-pass filtered 80S ribosome cryo-EM map (EMDB ID 2660) fromPlasmodium falciparum23was used as a reference map. The three best 3D classes, consisting of 447,323 particles, were subjected to 3D refinement, which yielded a consensus map of 3.1 Å resolution after post-processing. The gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion55was used for resolution estimation throughout data processing. These 447,323 particles were subjected to CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, followed by 3D refinement and post-processing, which improved the overall map quality and resolution to 2.8 Å (Supplementary Fig.2, Supplementary Table1). Further, the particles were subjected to a 3D classification into 3 classes without alignment, and one class with 378,061 particles, which has homogeneous particles, was selected. The particles were 3D refined and post-processed to 2.8 Å resolution. The gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion55was used for final resolution estimation. Local resolution was estimated using ResMap56, embedded in RELION. The final map was auto-sharpened using Phenix.auto_sharpen57.

Similar steps to those of 53S data processing were followed for the 75S ribosome refinement. For dataset 1, 100,475 particles were auto-picked using 2D reference images generated after manual particle picking and 2D classification. The auto-picked particles were subjected to 2D classification, and the best classes consisting of 45,379 particles were selected for 3D refinement, and a consensus cryo-EM map was generated at 3.6 Å resolution. A low-pass filtered to 60 Å cryo-EM map (EMDB ID 2660)from Plasmodium falciparum23was used as a reference map in the 3D refinement. The particles were polished using CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, which further improved the overall resolution to 3.3 Å. A 3D classification into 3 classes without alignment was performed on the polished particles. The best class with 37,355 (82%), was subjected to 3D refinement and post-processing, which yielded a 3.3 Å resolution cryo-EM map (Supplementary Fig.3). For dataset 2, similar data processing steps were followed. 96,868 particles were selected after 2D and 3D classification, which yielded a 3.0 Å resolution map after particle polishing (Supplementary Fig.3).

The polished particles from data 1 and data 2, a total of 142,247 particles, were merged, and a consensus map at 3.0 Å resolution was generated. Further, a 3D classification into 4 classes without alignment was performed. Two best classes emerged, class 1 having 39,958 (29%) particles with tRNA bound A/P- and P/E-sites of the ribosome, and another class (class 4) having 53,764 (38%) particles with tRNA bound at the P-site of the ribosome. Meanwhile, 29% of particles yield a low-resolution class, and 2% of particles remain unaligned. The 3D refinement and post-processing yielded a 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM map for both classes. A partial signal subtraction followed by focused refinement58was performed to further improve the quality and resolution of the LSU, SSU body, and SSU head map. After post-processing, the large subunit resolution improved to 3 Å for both classes. Whereas the class 1, SSU body and SSU head resolved to 3.2 Å and 3.4 Å resolution, respectively. Similarly, the class 4, SSU body and SSU head resolved to 3.1 Å and 3.4 Å resolution, respectively (Supplementary Fig.3, Supplementary Table1). The resolution was estimated using the gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion55and local resolution was calculated using ResMap56(Supplementary Fig.4). The Phenix.auto_sharpen was used to auto-sharpen the final maps57.

The 75S-PAR data was processed by following similar steps. Finally, the selected 54,889 particles yielded a 3.0 Å resolution cryo-EM map after particle polishing and 3D classification without alignment. A partial signal subtraction followed by focused refinement58for SSU body was performed59to improve the local resolution (Supplementary Fig.5and Supplementary Table1).

rRNA and r-protein coordinates were built by coalescing both approaches, which are template-based and de novo model building. The atomic coordinates ofToxoplasma gondii(PDB ID: 5XXB)25andHomo sapiens(PDB ID: 4UG013) were used for template-based modeling, where ribosomal rRNAs, 28S, 5S, and 5.8S were rigid-body docked into 53S cryo-EM using Chimera60. By convention, 28S rRNA was divided into 6 domains, and each was rigid-body docked (Supplementary Table4). The regions not fitting into the cryo-EM maps were deleted, and the nucleotide residues were mutated to theE. histolytica25S rRNA, 5.8S, and 5S rRNA sequences using COOT v.0.9.361. The nucleotide sequences were manually built in the cryo-EM map using COOT for the remaining segments of rRNA. The r-protein modules were initially built using Model Angelo62without the FASTA sequence, followed by threading of theEntamoebasequence on the carbon backbone using PHYRE263. The iterative steps of manual model building, real-space refinement, and geometry regularization were done in COOT, then phenix.real_space_refinement was used for the flexible refinement64.

For model building in the 75S, the atomic coordinates of the 53S ribosomal subunit were rigid docked in cryo-EM map of the LSU and followed by flexible refinement using phenix.real_space_refinement. The atomic coordinates of the 36S ribosomal subunit were built by following steps similar to that of the 53S model building in the 53S cryo-EM map described above. The final coordinates of the 53S and 36S were rigid-body docked in the 75S cryo-EM map and followed by flexible refinement using phenix.real_space_refinement. The model-building statistics are given in Supplementary Table1. Unless otherwise stated, all figures were prepared in Chimera and ChimeraX65. The RNA 2D diagram was prepared using the R2DT tool66at RNA Central usingSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandHomo sapiensas templates, RNAPDBee67–69, and Adobe Illustrator were also used.

Similarly, for the model building of the 75S-PAR complex, the coordinates of individual subunits were docked, followed by rigid body and flexible fitting using Phenix. The coordinates of PAR were docked from theE. coliribosome PAR complex, PDB 7K00. Figure9fwas generated using Discovery Studio70.
