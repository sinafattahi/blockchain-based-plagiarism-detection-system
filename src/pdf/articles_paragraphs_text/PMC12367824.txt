To investigate the association between intrinsic capacity (IC) and sarcopenia among older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

This cross-sectional study included 409 community-dwelling older adults with T2D (mean age: 71.2 ± 5.8 years; 207 men, 202 women). IC was assessed using the WHO framework across five domains: cognition (Brain Health Test), locomotion (Short Physical Performance Battery), vitality (Mini Nutritional Assessment–Short Form), sensory (vision and hearing tests), and psychological function (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale). Each impaired domain contributed one point to the total IC impairment score (range: 0–5), with higher scores indicating greater IC decline. Sarcopenia was defined based on the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria, including muscle mass, grip strength, and physical performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between IC impairment and sarcopenia.

The prevalence of sarcopenia was 13.4%, and the average IC impairment score was 0.8 ± 0.8. The most common impairments were hearing (42.1%) and vision (13.2%). Participants with sarcopenia had a significantly higher number of IC impairments. A greater number of impaired IC domains was associated with increased odds of sarcopenia. While locomotion and visual impairments showed a positive association, they were not statistically significant after adjusting for confounders.

Declines in IC, particularly in locomotion and sensory domains, were associated with higher likelihood of sarcopenia in older adults with T2D. Routine IC assessment may support early detection and preventive interventions in this high-risk population.

Intrinsic capacity (IC), a concept introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015, represents a comprehensive framework for assessing the physical, cognitive, and psychological functions of older adults. It reflects the dynamic interaction of multiple health domains including locomotion, cognition, vitality, sensory capacity, and psychosocial function and serves as a critical indicator of healthy aging [1–3]。.

IC is closely linked to functional ability in later life. Older adults with higher IC generally demonstrate better physical performance and a lower risk of functional decline [4]. Emerging evidence suggests that IC is also associated with systemic inflammation, whereby lower IC levels are accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers, possibly contributing to accelerated physiological deterioration [5,6]. A 10-year longitudinal study further demonstrated that lower IC is associated with increased mortality risk, whereas improvements in IC are linked to greater healthy life expectancy [7].

Despite the growing recognition of IC in geriatric assessment, there is still no universally accepted standard for its measurement. The multidimensional nature of IC, spanning physiological, cognitive, and psychological components, presents challenges to establishing a unified indicator [8].

Concurrently, the prevalence of sarcopenia has risen globally, particularly among older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sarcopenia in this population is associated with accelerated loss of muscle mass and strength, leading to increased risks of frailty, falls, hospitalization, and mortality [9–11]. Limited data are available on this relationship in community-dwelling older adults with T2D. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the association between intrinsic capacity and sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults with T2D.

This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and November 2023 at a community-based diabetes specialty clinic in northern Taiwan. A systematic random sampling method was employed, whereby one eligible individual was selected from every five consecutive patients attending outpatient services, based on the order of clinical registration.

Eligible participants were aged ≥ 65 years, diagnosed with T2D, and provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of psychiatric illness, severe orthopedic conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis or fractures), communication barriers (e.g., aphasia, deafness, blindness), or incomplete data for key study variables.

The sample size was estimated using G*Power 3.1, assuming an effect size of 0.15, α = 0.05, and power = 0.80, indicating a minimum required sample of 400. A total of 409 participants were recruited (207 men and 202 women; mean age: 71.2 ± 5.8 years). All participants underwent face-to-face interviews and standardized assessments conducted by trained nursing staff.

Sociodemographic information (age, gender, chronic disease status) and clinical data (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) were collected through structured interviews and medical record reviews. Body composition was measured using standardized equipment, and trained personnel administered all tools consistently.

Seven research instruments were used to collect data in this study. Trained members of the research team conducted interviews with participants and recorded their medical histories. Sociodemographic variables included age, gender, and types of chronic diseases. In addition, clinical indicators such as glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were obtained from participants’ medical records.

IC was evaluated in accordance with the WHO 2017 framework, comprising five domains: cognition, locomotion, vitality, sensory, and psychological function [12]. Cognition was assessed using the Brain Health Test (BHT; score range: 0–16), with a score < 10 indicating cognitive impairment, this cut-off has demonstrated high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (87%) in detecting mild level of dementia [13]. Locomotion was measured via the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), with scores < 10 considered indicative of impairment [14]. Vitality was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment–Short Form (MNA-SF); scores ≤ 11 was classified as impaired [15]. Sensory functions include both vision and hearing. Vision was screened using the WHO simple visual test; hearing was evaluated using the whispered voice test (“6, 1, 9”). Sensory impairment was scored as follows: 1 point for impairment in either vision or hearing, and 2 points if both were impaired. Psychological function was measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15); scores ≥ 7 indicated depressive symptoms [16]. An IC impairment score was computed as the total number of impaired domains (range: 0–5), with higher scores indicating greater functional decline.

Sarcopenia was defined according to the 2019 criteria established by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS), which include low muscle mass—defined as appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) < 7.0 kg/m² for men and < 5.7 kg/m² for women, accompanied by either reduced muscle strength (handgrip strength < 28 kg for men and < 18 kg for women) or poor physical performance (five-times sit-to-stand test time ≥ 12 s) [17]。.

Skeletal muscle mass was assessed using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA) device (InBody 770, Cerritos, CA, USA). SMI was calculated as the sum of appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by height squared (kg/m²). MF-BIA is a widely used, non-invasive, radiation-free tool with good reliability for estimating body composition [18,19]. All measurements were conducted by clinically trained nursing staff.

Muscle strength was evaluated using a digital handgrip dynamometer (TKK 5401; Takei Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Three trials were performed using the participant’s dominant hand, and the mean value was recorded [20]. Lower extremity performance was assessed using the five-times sit-to-stand test, in which participants were instructed to rise from a seated position five times consecutively as quickly as possible. A completion time of ≥ 12 s was classified as impaired performance [21]. All tests were administered by experienced nursing professionals.

Covariates included age, gender, types of chronic diseases, duration of T2D, A1C, and body mass index (BMI). These variables were considered potential confounders in the relationship between IC and Sarcopenia.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Landseed International Hospital (IRB No. 22-020-B1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. Data was anonymized to ensure confidentiality.

All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and percentages) were used to summarize participant characteristics, IC domain impairments, and sarcopenia prevalence. Chi-square tests and independent t-tests were applied to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively, between sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups (Tables1and2).

Variables withp< 0.05 in univariate analyses were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association between IC impairments and sarcopenia. Covariates included in the model were age, T2D duration, and BMI. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 409 community-dwelling older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were included in the study. The mean age was 71.2 ± 5.8 years, and 50.6% (n= 207) were men. The mean duration of T2D was 14.7 ± 8.5 years. Based on the AWGS 2019 criteria, 55 participants (13.4%) were classified as having sarcopenia. Compared with participants without sarcopenia, those in the sarcopenia group were significantly older (p< 0.001), had a longer duration of T2D (p= 0.026), and a lower BMI (p< 0.001). Additionally, the sarcopenia group exhibited significantly poorer physical performance, with reduced handgrip strength (p< 0.001), longer sit-to-stand time (p= 0.002), and lower SMI (p< 0.001) (Table1).

The average number of impaired IC domains was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group (p< 0.001). In total, 70.9% of those with sarcopenia had at least one IC domain impairment. Domain-specific analysis showed that impairments in vision (p= 0.014), hearing (p= 0.044), and locomotion (p= 0.011) were significantly more common in the sarcopenia group (Table2).

Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine the association between each IC domain and sarcopenia, adjusting for age, sex, duration of T2D, and BMI. Although not statistically significant, visual impairment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.99, 95% CI: 0.96–4.15,p= 0.066) and impaired locomotion (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI: 0.75–7.20,p= 0.142) were positively associated with sarcopenia (Table3).

As shown in Fig.1, the prevalence of sarcopenia increased with the number of impaired IC domains. Participants with three or more impairments had the highest prevalence of sarcopenia (p for trend < 0.001), suggesting a cumulative effect of multidomain IC decline on sarcopenia risk.

We found that 70.9% of participants with sarcopenia exhibited impairment in at least one IC domain in this study. The number of IC impaired domains was significantly higher compared to non-sarcopenic individuals. Positive associations were observed between impairments in all IC domains except vitality and the likelihood of sarcopenia. Although these associations did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for covariates, the findings suggest a potential effect of multidomain IC decline on sarcopenia risk.

Sensory impairment emerged as the most common IC deficit in this population, with hearing and vision impairments observed in 42.1% and 13.2% of participants, respectively. Overall, 54.8% of all participants exhibited impairment in at least one IC domain. These findings aligned with previous literature indicate that sensory deficits are common complications in individuals with T2D. A study reported that 66.2% of middle-aged adults with T2D had some degree of hearing loss, emphasizing hearing impairment as an underestimated diabetes-related complication [22]. In addition, T2D patients with two or more sensory impairments had significantly lower lower-limb muscle strength compared to non-diabetic individuals, suggesting a potential interaction between multisensory loss and physical decline [23]. Moreover, a large-scale study involving 68,235 adults demonstrated that both hearing and vision impairments were independently associated with increased odds of sarcopenia, and that the risk further increased with the presence of multiple sensory impairments [24]. These findings support our results, highlighting the importance of early screening and management of sensory impairment in older adults with T2D as part of sarcopenia prevention strategies.

Our findings revealed that the prevalence of sarcopenia increased with the number of impaired IC domains, suggesting a potential cumulative relationship. Consistent with previous studies, IC impairment has been identified as a predictor of adverse health outcomes such as frailty, falls, and mortality [25,26]. These results underscore the importance of early detection and ongoing monitoring of IC decline in older adults with T2D.

Although the present study did not explore the underlying biological mechanisms, previous research has proposed plausible pathways linking IC impairment and sarcopenia. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with reduced IC [27]. These pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to muscle protein degradation and inhibit muscle synthesis, ultimately leading to sarcopenia, this chronic low-grade inflammatory state has been particularly linked to declines in vitality and cognitive domains of IC [5,28].

In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction associated with aging has been implicated in reduced energy production and increased oxidative stress, both of which contribute to muscle atrophy [29]. Mitochondrial changes have been associated with lower IC, especially in relation to declines in physical performance and vitality [30]. Moreover, degeneration of the neuromuscular junction impairs muscle contractile efficiency, resulting in weakness and progressive muscle loss [31]. This neuromuscular decline has been associated with deteriorations in locomotion and cognitive function [32].These interconnected biological mechanisms provide a potential explanation for the observed association between IC impairment and sarcopenia.

In this study, the prevalence of sarcopenia among older adults with T2D was 13.4%. Participants with sarcopenia were significantly older, had a longer duration of diabetes, lower BMI and SMI, and demonstrated poorer physical performance, specifically lower HGS and longer FTSST durations. These findings are consistent with the diagnostic criteria proposed by the AWGS, which emphasize the assessment of both muscle mass and function [17]. A meta-analysis reported an overall sarcopenia prevalence of 18% in individuals with diabetes, identifying age, elevated HbA1c, visceral fat area, diabetic nephropathy, longer diabetes duration, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as significant risk factors [33]. Chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation commonly observed in T2D may accelerate muscle protein degradation and impair muscle regeneration, thereby increasing susceptibility to sarcopenia [34,35]. These data underscore the multifactorial etiology of sarcopenia in diabetic populations and reinforce the need for early screening and integrated management strategies among older adults with T2D.

This study has several strengths. First, to our knowledge, it is one of the first to investigate the association between IC and sarcopenia in older adults with T2D. Second, the study employed a comprehensive assessment of IC across five functional domains using validated tools, along with standardized criteria for sarcopenia based on the 2019 AWGS guidelines. These findings highlight the clinical significance of IC in preventing or delaying the onset of sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults with T2D.

However, this study also has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design precludes the establishment of causal relationships between IC impairment and sarcopenia. Second, Differences in the assessment tools used for evaluating IC domains may influence the interpretation of results [36]. For instance, in assessing hearing impairment, some studies have adopted objective audiometric tests [37], while others have relied on self-reported measures [38]. In the present study, hearing impairment was evaluated using the whispered voice test. However, the lack of control over ambient background noise during testing may have introduced misclassification bias, potentially affecting the accuracy and generalizability of the findings. Third, as all participants had T2D, caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings to older adults with other chronic conditions or to the broader aging population. Lastly, the study was conducted in a single community setting in northern Taiwan, which may limit external validity.

This study found that IC impairment was common among older adults with T2D, particularly in the sensory domain. A greater number of impaired IC domains was associated with an increased likelihood of sarcopenia, though not statistically significant after adjusting for covariates. These findings highlight the clinical relevance of IC, especially locomotor and sensory functions, in identifying older adults with T2D at risk for sarcopenia. Early screening and multidomain assessment based on the IC framework may help guide timely interventions to support healthy aging in this population.
