Intellectual disability (ID) significantly impacts individual development and imposes a societal burden. Although mild ID accounts for approximately 85% of total cases, research into its genetic etiology remains relatively limited. We investigated a two-generation pedigree exhibiting varying degrees of global developmental delay (GDD) and ID. We collected clinical data from the proband and her parents, identified the genetic etiology through testing, investigated pathogenic mechanisms, and provided family genetic counseling.

Peripheral blood samples were collected from pedigree members for chromosomal karyotyping and genomic DNA extraction. Trio exome sequencing (Trio-ES) was performed on the DNA samples. Candidate variants identified were validated using Sanger sequencing, and their pathogenicity was assessed in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).

The proband, a 2-year-old female, presented with GDD. Her father exhibited borderline intellectual disability, while her mother had mild intellectual disability. ES analysis revealed: Exome sequencing identified a unknown inheritance heterozygous variant (NM_001202543.2[CUX1]: c.2637G > A [p.Trp879*]) in both the proband and her father, classified as likely pathogenic. The mother carried an 8.60 Mb deletion (seq[hg19]del(9)(p24.3p24.1), which was classified as a pathogenic copy number variant (CNV).

Our findings expand the spectrum of genetic variations associated withCUX1-related disorders. The conclusive molecular diagnosis established through genetic testing not only facilitated accurate genetic counseling but also reduced the time and economic burdens associated with the diagnostic odyssey.

Intellectual Disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized primarily by deficits in cognitive function and adaptive behavior, with a global prevalence estimated at 1%−3% [1]. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the diagnostic criteria for ID require the onset of impairments in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior during the developmental period (before age 18) [2]. Clinically, ID is categorized based on the degree of functional impairment into mild (IQ 55–70), moderate (IQ 40–55), severe (IQ 25–40), profound (IQ < 25), and unspecified types. Mild ID constitutes most cases, accounting for up to 85%. Individuals with mild ID typically achieve a mental age equivalent to 9–11 years in adulthood, and most can acquire basic self-care skills through training [3].

ID exhibits significant etiological heterogeneity. Genetic factors, such as chromosomal abnormalities and monogenic disorders, are implicated in approximately 50% of severe cases. In contrast, mild ID often results from polygenic-environmental interactions. In a study of 651 patients with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF), Sätilä et al. reported that approximately 39% had comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), while anxiety disorders and conduct problems were also prevalent comorbidities. Among the 245 patients with confirmed ID, etiological investigations revealed genetic syndromes or chromosomal abnormalities in 31% of cases [4]. Notably, offspring of individuals with familial ID face a 3- to 5-fold increased risk of birth defects compared to the general population. Additionally, women with ID face increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes [4]. Therefore, effective prenatal diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of birth defects. In current clinical practice, genetic testing is primarily applied for etiological diagnosis in moderate to severe ID. The diagnostic yield for mild intellectual disability remains low (typically < 20%) due to limited genetic evidence [5]. Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities possess the same inherent reproductive rights as the general population [6]. Genetic counseling aims to provide optimized reproductive health services and support informed decision-making for individuals with developmental disabilities [7]. Our study reports two likely pathogenic variants were indentified in the family through ES. The pedigree demonstrates mild ID phenotypes across three consecutive generations, highlighting the clinical utility of ES in diagnosing ID with complex inheritance patterns.

Clinical data from pedigree members were collected, comprising physical examinations, specialist consultations, laboratory investigations, and the creation of a pedigree chart(Fig.1).

The pedigree chart indicates the proband (arrow), the paternally inherited CUX1 variant, the maternally carried 9p24.3p24.1 deletion, and the paternal uncle who did not undergo genetic segregation testing.

After being fully informed that this medical research utilizes peripheral blood leukocytes as human genetic resources for high-throughput sequencing to generate data with potential value for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, and having thoroughly understood the risks, burdens, and benefits of the study, the participants’ parents provided informed consent based on their genuine willingness to participate. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital/Sichuan Provincial Woman’s and Children’s Hospital (protocol code: 20230807-218 and date:2023.08. 07).

Peripheral venous blood samples (0.5 mL) were collected from the proband and both parents using sodium heparin anticoagulant. The samples were aseptically inoculated into a biphasic culture system: simultaneous initiation of a 72-hour short-term culture and a 7-day long-term culture to maximize metaphase cell yield. Harvested cell suspensions underwent sequential fixation, dropping, staining, and drying, followed by G-banding. Chromosome imaging and karyotype analysis were performed using the MetaSystems Ikaros fully automated chromosome scanning and analysis system (MetaSystems GmbH, Germany). A minimum of 20 well-spread metaphase spreads were scanned per sample. Five representative metaphases were analyzed at a band resolution of 500 according to the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN 2020). Karyotype arrangement and aberration screening were conducted using the IKaros software (version 5.7).

Peripheral venous blood samples (2 mL each) were collected from the proband and both parents using 2% disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) anticoagulant. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen kit (Hilden, Germany). DNA quantification was performed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Samples meeting quality control standards (concentration ≥ 20 ng/µL, total amount ≥ 1000 ng) were stored at −20 °C. Genome exons were captured using the GenCap®Whole Exome Capture Probe V6.0 chip. Following quality-controlled enrichment, the captured fragments were used to construct a genomic library. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nextseq 500 platform. The average sequencing depth achieved was 104.38×, with over 97.37% of the target regions attaining coverage of ≥ 20×. Alignment: Sequencing data were aligned against the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19). Variants with a population frequency ≥ 5% in the following databases were filtered out: 1000 Genomes Project NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500) The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) ExAC East Asian subset (ExAC-EAS; ~4000 East Asian individuals). Candidate variants were validated through segregation analysis within the pedigree. The pathogenicity of variants was predicted using bioinformatic tools including REVEL, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, M-CAP, and MutationTaster. Variants were annotated and cross-referenced with the proband’s clinical phenotype and family history using databases such as OMIM, HGMD, ClinVar, MITOMAP, and PubMed. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and/InDels were classified for pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) 2015 guidelines [8]. CNVs were assessed for pathogenicity based on the joint consensus recommendations of ACMG and the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) [9].

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was enriched using the IDT xGen®Human mtDNA Research Panel. High-throughput sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mitochondrial reference genome (NC_012920.1) for variant calling. Identified variants were annotated and cross-referenced with major mitochondrial databases: MITOMAP (https://www.mitomap.org), mtDB (http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se), and mtSNP (http://mtsnp.tmig.or.jp).

IV−1 (The proband) is a 2-year-3-month-old female admitted following 9 episodes of febrile seizures within the past year. Recurrent febrile seizures (temperature ≥ 38.5 °C) began at 1 year of age, with two seizures occurring within a 24-hour period. The seizure type was generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), lasting 10–20 min per episode and terminating following intravenous diazepam administration. Her parents were non-consanguineous. At conception, the mother was 24 years old and the father was 26 years old. There was no known teratogen exposure during pregnancy. The proband was delivered via cesarean section at 37 weeks + 6 days of gestation due to maternal gestational hypertension. Birth measurements included a length of 47 cm (< 50th percentile), weight of 2.75 kg (< 50th percentile), and head circumference of 32 cm (< 50th percentile). There was no history of perinatal hypoxia, trauma, or infection. She has gross motor and language delays, achieving independent walking and use of reduplicated words (“mama”, “dada”) at 1.6 years old. Physical examination revealed a height of 89 cm (< 50th percentile), weight of 11 kg (< 25th percentile), and head circumference of 47 cm (< 50th percentile). There were no facial deformities. The proband underwent developmental assessment using the 0–6 Years Developmental Behavior Scale. The results showed a developmental age of 19.5 months, developmental quotient (DQ) of 72 (Mild abnormality), and motor assessment (Peabody Developmental Motor Scales) of moderately low/below average. Laboratory tests, including blood routine examination, liver and renal function tests, lactate/pyruvate levels, thyroid function tests, plasma ammonia, and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, were within the normal reference range. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a pineal cyst(Fig.2).

Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed nearly normal, occasional sharp- or spike-and-slow-wave discharges in the central region during sleep monitoring(Figure3).

III−3 (The proband’s mother) is a 27-year-old female who can only recognize basic numbers. She has significant arithmetic difficulties (unable to perform addition or subtraction within 10), impaired verbal fluency, and deficits in analytical reasoning, judgment, inferential thinking, and calculation abilities. She dropped out of junior high school but is independent in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) and capable of performing simple household chores. Physical examination revealed short stature (height: 152 cm; the average height of adult women in this area is 159.4 cm), a high-arched palate, and low-set ears. She was evaluated using the Chinese revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC), which confirmed a Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) of 65 (indicating mild intellectual disability). Her parents and siblings had no history of epilepsy, ID, or other related neurodevelopmental disorders.

III−2 (The proband’s father) is a 28-year-old male, who spoke for the first time at 18 months and learned to walk at 24 months. He manifested persistent learning difficulties during formal education, culminating in junior high school discontinuation. He is a blue-collar worker, exhibits weaker language comprehension and poor observational skills. He Assessment using the Chinese revised WAIS-RC diagnosed him with borderline intellectual functioning (FSIQ = 75).

II-2 (Proband’s paternal grandmother), aged 53, has unclear early developmental history and exhibits irritability. II-5 (Proband’s paternal great-uncle), aged 47, had delayed speech (first words at 24 months) and motor milestones (independent walking at 36 months). He remains unmarried, with poor peer interaction and no close friendships. No formal assessment has been performed. They are independent in ADLs and capable of performing simple tasks but demonstrate poor comprehension and reasoning abilities.

Chromosomal karyotype analysis showed no abnormalities in the proband or her parents (Fig.4).

No pathogenic variants were identified in mitochondrial genome sequencing.

ES identified a variantNM_001202543.2(CUX1):c.2637G > A (p.Trp879*), ClinVar variation ID: 3,896,739 in IV−1, inherited from III−2 (the proband’s father). This variant was classified as Likely Pathogenic (PVS1 + PM2_Supporting) according to ACMG guidelines (Fig.5).

Additionally, both IV−1 and III−2 carried the variantNM_182641.3(BPTF):c.1624 C > T (p.Arg542Trp), classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) by ACMG assessment.

ES revealed the following CNVs in III−3 (the proband’s mother): seq[hg19]del(9)(p24.3p24.1)NC_000009.11: g.134929_8733886del, spanning 8.60 Mb (Fig.6).

ACMG/ClinGen CNV Pathogenicity Scoring Evidence: 1 A (0): Region contains protein-coding gene(s) or other functionally important element(s). 2 A (1): Region overlaps a defined haploinsufficient region (9p24.3, includesDMRT1). 2 H (0.15): Two or more HI prediction algorithms predict haploinsufficiency for gene(s) in this region (UHRF2,CDC37L1,RFX3,SMARCA2,PTPRD). 3B (0.45): Region contains 25–34 protein-coding genes. This CNV was classified as Pathogenic.The proband did not carry this CNV. The proband’s mother also carried seq[hg19]dup(10)(q11.21q11.22)NC_000010.10:g.45891269_46312745dup, spanning 421.476 Kb, in this region (ALOX5,MARCHF8,ZFAND4,WASHC2C). This CNV was classified as Uncertain Significance.

Thus, the proband was diagnosed with Global developmental delay with or without impaired intellectual development (NEDDMS; OMIM: 618330), caused by theCUX1variant. III−2 was diagnosed as 9p Deletion Syndrome (OMIM: #158170) [10].

Unfortunately, genetic testing was not completed for other family members. The origin of theCUX1variant carried by III−2 could not be determined. It could not be assessed whether the parents of III−3 are carriers of a balanced translocation.

Through trio-ES we successfully identified the genetic etiology underlying GDD/ID in this pedigree. Due to practical constraints, comprehensive genetic testing could not be extended to other family members. The proband initially presented with recurrent febrile seizures as the primary clinical manifestation. Although febrile seizures are a common pediatric condition generally associated with favorable outcomes, this case exhibited several high-risk features: initial seizure onset before 18 months of age, occurrence of status epilepticus, and developmental assessment indicating mild GDD [11]. Given that a subset of febrile seizures may evolve into epilepsy, recurrent episodes may increase the risk of cognitive impairment, and the patient had a confirmed family history of ID, we conducted a systematic genetic risk assessment and validation. Exome sequencing identified a shared heterozygousCUX1nonsense variant (NM_001202543.2: c.2637G > A; p.Trp879*) in the proband and her father.

TheCUX1gene comprises 24 exons. Its encoded protein is expressed in most pyramidal neurons within layers II-V of the cerebral cortex and specific neuronal subpopulations in the hippocampus [12,13]. Initially studied for its tumorigenic role,CUX1nonsense and frameshift variants have been identified across diverse tumors [14]. The neurodevelopmental role was first established in 2018 [15], with ~ 50 cases now reported globally. Clinical presentations may include ID or occur without ID. Studies of Cux1 haploinsufficient mice(Cux1+/−mice)demonstrate reduced Cux1 protein expression, suggesting that loss-of-function is the primary pathogenic mechanism [16]. According to the genotype-phenotype analysis of 32 patients by Oppermann et al. [16],de novoinheritance was predominant (26/34, 76.5%), familial cases were rare (6/34), and frameshift mutations were common (5/6). Catch-up growth after growth retardation was observed in approximately 30% (10/32) of patients, epilepsy occurred in 25% (8/32), and 6.25% (n= 2/32) had refractory epilepsy—significantly exceeding the general population’s lifetime prevalence (3%) [16]. Rare features included disorders of sex development (DSD) [16,17]. Like other autosomal dominant disorders, NEDDMS exhibits variable expressivity. For example, individuals 18–20 p.(Ala1067Cysfs*3) showed divergent phenotypes, including facial dysmorphism, torticollis, and cardiopulmonary anomalies, suggesting incomplete penetrance or the presence of modifiers [16]. Similarly, individuals 5–6 with the p.(Glu329*) variant manifested differing abnormalities, such as behavioral issues and genital deformities [16]. As the first reported Chinese case, our proband’s GDD presentation aligns with established NEDDMS phenotypic spectra. The proband’s father exhibited GDD in early childhood and was later assessed to have borderline intellectual functioning in adulthood. The mechanisms by whichCUX1regulates postnatal neurodevelopment, particularly its effects on catch-up growth and epileptogenesis, remain unclear. In Oppermann’s three familial cases [16] offspring exhibited variable intellectual outcomes (1/3 normal, 1/3 borderline, 1/3 moderately impaired), with no progressive deterioration, and several had nonsense variants, including the variant p.(Gln21*), p.(Glu329*), p.(Gln536*), p.(Gln574*),p.(Gln873*), and p.(Trp1199*). No correlation was found between genotype and the severity of intellectual disability, epilepsy, or behavioral problems. As a tumor suppressor, CUX1/Cut protein displays strict dosage sensitivity: both haploinsufficiency and overexpression disrupt cellular differentiation programs across lineages [18]. Zhao et al. [19] have observed lung development and regeneration in Cux1-floxed mouse model. Future studies should expand cohort sizes and integrate functional assays to elucidate molecular pathomechanisms.

The proband’s mother harbors a 9p24.3 deletion (chr9:134929–873388, hg19) consistent with 9p Deletion Syndrome (OMIM #158170). The canonical breakpoints for this syndrome map to 9p22-p24, encompassing the haploinsufficient region 9p24.3 (which includesDMRT1). Core phenotypes include GDD/ID [10,20]. We have noticed that this region contains variations in two genes,SMARCA2andRFX3, which are associated with autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorders and have established gene-disease validity [21,22]. Non-truncating mutations in the ATPase domain of the SMARCA2 protein cause Nicolaides–Baraitser Syndrome (NCBRS, OMIM #601358) [23]. The characteristics of NCBRS include ID, sparse hair, prominent interphalangeal joints, coarse facies, and epilepsy. Variants ofSMARCA2located outside the helicase domain are associated with blepharophimosis intellectual disability syndrome (BIS, OMIM # 619293). Both NCBRS and BIS are primarily caused by missense variants ofSMARCA2.Mouse experiments have shown that heterozygous or complete deletion ofSMARCA2has no effect on development [24]. There is clear evidence supporting the association betweenRFX3and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Affected individuals exhibit delayed motor and speech development, ID, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most reported variants are de novo, and the disease mechanism is believed to be haploinsufficiency, although there is a lack of functional validation of the protein [22]. Thus, 9p Deletion Syndrome pathogenesis cannot be attributed to single-gene haploinsufficiency alone. The phenotypic manifestations likely result from the synergistic deletion of multiple genes on 9p short arm and/or modifying genomic factors that collectively contribute to the clinical presentation [20,25].

In clinical practice, individuals with borderline or mild ID often experience underdiagnosis and undertreatment, with significant gaps in genetic counseling and reproductive decision-making support. Limited access to recurrence risk information and precision diagnostics in this population may perpetuate preventable disease burden through intergenerational transmission. ES represents an efficient screening tool with potential as a first-tier diagnostic modality for ID. These measures will enable definitive genetic diagnosis for phenotypically complex or familial ID cases, while providing families with precise recurrence risk quantification.
