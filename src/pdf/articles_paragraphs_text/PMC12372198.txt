Tn7 mobile genetic elements are known for their sophisticated target-site selection mechanisms and, in some cases, programmability. Recognition of target sites is mediated by designated transposon-encoded proteins and modulated by host factor proteins. In the case of the CRISPR-associated Tn7 elements from the type V-K, the ribosomal protein uS15 is an integral component of recruitment complex that promotes R-loop completion. Previous biochemical work also revealed that the ribosomal protein uL29 and the acyl carrier protein (ACP) influence Tn7 transposition frequency in vitro. However, how uL29 and ACP regulate the formation of the Tn7 targeting complex remains unclear. The prototypical Tn7 element encodes a heteromeric transposase (TnsA, TnsB), a AAA + adaptor (TnsC), and two target-site selection proteins (TnsD and TnsE). TnsD targets a highly conserved site at the end of theglmSgene (attTn7). However, poor protein stability has precluded the molecular characterization of how TnsD recognizes its target site. Here, we show that ACP and uL29 interact with the C-terminal region of TnsD through reciprocal electrostatic interactions, in turn, mitigating its tendency to aggregate. Additionally, we identify the uL29 and ACP residues that mediate the interaction with TnsD and stimulate DNA binding. These results unveil unique features of the TnsD-mediated target-site selection complex.

DNA transposons are genetic segments capable of moving and replicating within genomes. Some transposons insert into multiple sites, while others are site-specific. The Tn7 family of transposons is characterized by its sophisticated DNA targeting mechanisms. The prototypical Tn7 element has two alternative targeting pathways that target either a highly conserved genomic site or replication structure in conjugal plasmids, ensuring the efficient vertical and horizontal spread of the element [1]. To mediate these two insertion mechanisms, Tn7 encodes five proteins: TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TnsD and TnsE. TnsA and TnsB form a heteromeric transposase (TnsAB), which catalyzes the transposon’s movement, excising the element from the donor DNA and joining the ends to the target DNA. However, TnsAB is not active on its own. Association with the AAA + ATPase TnsC forms the active transposition complex (TnsABC). TnsC functions as an adaptor between TnsAB and the target-site selection proteins TnsD or TnsE. TnsD belongs to the TnsD/TniQ family of proteins and directs insertion to the so-called Tn7 attachment site (attTn7), located at the 3’ end of the highly conservedglmSgene [2]. Alternatively, the interaction with TnsE directs insertions to replicative DNA structures in conjugal plasmids, promoting the dispersal of the element across species [3].

TheattTn7site includes the very last 36 bp of theglmSopen reading frame [4]. Although TnsD binds to the coding sequence for theglmSgene, the insertion site lies 27 bp downstream from the binding site, providing a safe harbor for Tn7 insertions without deleterious effects on the host [4]. TnsD contains a conserved N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–165) characteristic of the TniQ/TnsD family that mediates the interactions with the TnsC adaptor and binds DNA without sequence specificity [5,6], and a variable C-terminal region that specifically targets theattTn7site (Fig.1a). Deleting even ten residues from the C-terminus suppresses its specificity for theattTn7site [4].

The structure of N-terminal domain of Tn7 TnsD (TnsD-NTD) bound to TnsC has demonstrated that this domain functions as a nucleotide-exchange factor for TnsC and promotes the DNA-dependent oligomerization of TnsC (Suppl. Fig.S1a) [6,7]. A recent structure of the TnsABCD transposome complex from a type I-B2 CAST (CRISPR-associated transposon) unveiled an intriguing DNA binding interaction, where both the N- and C-terminal domains of TnsD interact with TnsC (Suppl. Fig.S1b) [8]. This finding is at odds with previous biochemical analysis studies for the prototypical Tn7 element showing that the N-terminal domain suffices to mediate the interaction with TnsC [4]. It is possible that type I-B2 TnsD binds itsattsite differently than the prototypical Tn7 element, or that the structure of the type I-B2 TnsABCD tranpososome provided a fragmented view of the complex. The acyl carrier protein (ACP) and the ribosomal protein uL29 stimulate binding of TnsD from the prototypical Tn7 element to theattTn7site [9]. Moreover, simultaneous addition of uL29 and ACP caused a three-fold increase in transposition frequency in vitro [9]. Analogously, in vivo experiments showed a 9‐fold decrease in transposition when anE. colistrain containing an internal deletion of 16 amino acids within uL29 was used [9]. In the case of the type V-K CAST, the ribosomal protein uS15 is an integral component of recruitment complex that promotes R-loop completion [10]. Therefore, it is plausible that ACP and uL29 enhance Tn7 transposition by stabilizing the interaction of TnsD with theattTn7site.

Here, we sought to elucidate the effect of ACP and uL29 on TnsD. We found that TnsD is prone to aggregation but addition of both ACP and uL29 partially mitigates its instability. This effect occurs through reciprocal electrostatic interactions with the C-terminal region of TnsD. We identified and characterized uL29 and ACP residues mediating the interaction with the TnsD:attTn7complex. These results provide valuable information to elucidate how TnsD assembles a targeting complex atattTn7sites.

TnsD fromE. coli(Uniprot entryP13991) was subcloned from a plasmid containing all Tn7-encoded proteins (from Nancy Craig’s Lab) into the expression vector pET22b containing a C-terminal 6x Histidine tag (pAG9323). The pAG9323 plasmid was then transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen #44–0049) supplemented with a plasmid encoding rare tRNAs (pRARE) and grown in LB medium at 37 °C to OD600∼0.7. Cell cultures were cold shocked using an ice/water bath and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Cultures were grown at 16 °C overnight with an orbital agitation of 220 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,990gfor 15 min and pellets were stored at -80 °C until further use.

Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 10% v/v glycerol) with a protease inhibitors cocktail containing pepstatin A (1 µM), PMSF (1.0 mM), leupeptin (12 µM) and benzamidine (1.0 mM). Pellets were lysed by sonication and the protease inhibitors were added again. The sample was centrifuged at 39,200g, 4 °C, 45 min and the supernatant discarded. The lysis process was repeated twice to wash the cell pellet. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 20 mL of extraction buffer each (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 M urea, 0.5% tween-20 and 10% v/v glycerol) and protease inhibitors cocktail. Pellets were sonicated and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation (39,200g, 4 °C, 45 min). The supernatant was supplemented with 1.0 mM PMSF and incubated with 10 mL (5 mL per tube) of charged HisPur™ Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Scientific) pre-equilibrated with extraction buffer for 30 min. Beads were washed three times with 15 mL per tube of 30 mM imidazole buffer and the protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole. TnsD-containing elutions were diluted to a final NaCl concentration of 380 mM and supplemented with 1.0 mM PMSF. The protein was loaded into a 5 mL HiTrap Heparin HP column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with Heparin buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 380 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 10% v/v glycerol). After a 10 CV wash with Heparin buffer, TnsD was eluted with 1 M NaCl and purity was assessed via SDS-PAGE. Fractions were flash-frozen and stored at − 80 °C. TnsD was not concentrated to prevent aggregation, but Amicon Millipore 6 ml 30,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrators were used when assessing stability in the absence/presence of host factors.

DNA binding of TnsD in the presence or absence of host factors (or host factors variants) was assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). DNA substrates were prepared by annealing FAM-labeled oligonucleotides with their unlabeled complementary DNA in equimolar amounts in nuclease-free water. The DNA substrates used were the + 23 to + 58 duplex DNA ofattTn7(FAM-5’TTACTCAACCGTAACCGATTTTGCCAGGTTACGCGG3’;5’CCGCGTAACCTGGCAAAATCGGTTACGGTTGAGTAA3’) and a scrambled DNA sequence (FAM-5’ATACTAACAATCAGAACCCGGATTAATCGAAAGCTT3’;5’AAGCTTTCGATTAATCCGGGTTCTGATTGTTAGTAT3’). Increasing concentrations of TnsD (0–80 nM), host factors (0–640 nM) or a combination of both were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with the duplex DNA substrates (10 nM) in EMSA-reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA and 5% glycerol). The final volume of the reactions was 20 µL, from which 15 µL were resolved on 5% non-denaturing Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gels for 1:05 h at 4 °C and a constant voltage of 80 V in EMSA-running buffer (25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine). Gels were imaged using a Sapphire™ Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems).

The plasmids encodingE. coliuL29 (Uniprot entryP0A7M6) and ACP (Uniprot entryP0A6A8) were purchased from GenScript, subcloned into the expression vector pET28a(+)-TEV containing a removable N-terminal 6x histidine tag, sequenced and archived (pAG9431: uL29; pAG9432: ACP). Protein expression and solubility in different cell lines was assayed as described earlier [11].

To produce uL29, the pAG9431 plasmid was transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen #44–0049) containing the pRARE plasmid and grown in LB medium at 37 °C with orbital agitation to an OD600∼0.7. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. For ACP, the pAG9432 plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen #69450) and grown in LB medium at 37 °C with orbital agitation to an OD600∼0.7. Cell cultures were cold shocked immediately prior to protein expression induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG and incubated at 16 °C overnight. For both proteins, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,990gfor 15 min and pellets were stored at -80 °C.

Both proteins were purified similarly. Cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM imidazole and 5% v/v glycerol) with a protease inhibitors cocktail as described above. Cells were lysed by sonication and the lysates clarified by centrifugation (39,200g, 4 °C, 45 min). The supernatant was loaded into a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Impurities were eliminated washing with 36 mM imidazole and protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole. The histidine-tag was removed with TEV protease during dialysis in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5% v/v glycerol. The tagless proteins were loaded again onto the 5 mL HisTrap HP column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with dialysis buffer. ACP eluted immediately, but uL29 required the addition of 24 mM imidazole to the buffer. All other contaminants (TEV protease, histidine tag, etc.) remained tightly bound to the column.

Fractions containing uL29 were pooled and loaded into a Mono S™ 5/50 GL cation exchange chromatography column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with MonoS buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5% v/v glycerol). uL29 was eluted with a salt gradient to 425 mM NaCl. The purified samples were concentrated using an Amicon Millipore 6 ml 5,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator, flash-frozen in 20% glycerol, and stored at − 80 °C.

Fractions containing ACP were loaded into a Mono Q™ 10/100 GL anion exchange chromatography column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with MonoQ buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 5% v/v glycerol). The two forms of ACP were eluted with a linear gradient to 500 mM NaCl. Apo ACP eluted at ∼350 mM NaCl and holo ACP at ∼365 mM NaCl. The two proteins were pooled separately, and the samples were concentrated using Amicon Millipore 6 ml 5,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrators, flash-frozen in 20% glycerol, and stored at − 80 °C.

The uL29R47A/R48S/K54A(pAG9527), uL29R47A/K54A(pAG9550) and uL29K2A/R52A(pAG9567) variants were generated from the plasmid encoding wildtype uL29 (pAG9431) by site-directed mutagenesis using the Q5®Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). pAG9432 was used to generate ACPD39R/E42A(pAG9528). All variants were verified by DNA sequencing (Génome Québec Innovation Centre).

All the variants were produced as described above using either BL21 Star (DE3) cells supplemented with the pRARE plasmid (uL29R47A/R48S/K54Aexpressed at 16 °C ON, uL29K2A/R52Aexpressed at 37 °C for 3 h, ACPD39R/E42Aexpressed at 16 °C ON) or BL21 (DE3) cells (uL29R47A/K54Aexpressed at 37 °C for 3 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,990gfor 15 min and pellets were stored at -80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM imidazole and 5% v/v glycerol) supplemented with a protease inhibitors cocktail. Pellets were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation (39,200g, 4 °C, 45 min).

uL29 and ACP variants were purified as described above with minor differences. On the first HisTrap HP column step, contaminants were washed with 45 mM (instead of 36 mM) imidazole. For the second HisTrap HP column step, the uL29K2A/R52Arequired 36 mM (rather than 24 mM) imidazole for elution. All uL29 variants were then diluted to a final NaCl concentration of 75 mM and loaded into a Mono S™ 5/50 GL cation exchange chromatography column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 75 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5% v/v glycerol. uL29R47A/K54Aand uL29K2A/R52Awere eluted with a linear gradient to 325 mM NaCl. For uL29R47A/R48S/K54A, the protein flowed through the column, but contaminants did not, resulting in a pure sample.

The identity of the two ACP species from the ionic exchange column was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Each sample was diluted in MS buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine) to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. Protein was then diluted in 0.1% formic acid, and 1 µg was injected on an Agilent C4 BEH 1.0/10 mm column and washed 5 min with 4% acetonitrile, followed by a 20 min 4–90% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, with a flow rate of 20 µL/min. The samples were analyzed on a Bruker Impact II ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a funnel ESI source. Data was acquired in positive ion profile mode, with a capillary voltage of 4500 V and dry nitrogen heated at 200 °C. Spectra were analyzed using the manufacturer’s software DataAnalysis (Bruker). The total ion chromatogram was used to determine where the protein eluted, and spectra were summed over the entire elution peak. Multiply charged ion species were deconvoluted at 10,000-resolution using the maximum entropy method. A difference of approximately 340 Da between the protein peaks corresponded to the molecular weight of a phosphopantetheine group, characteristic of holo ACP.

For ACPD39R/E42A, the two species were diluted to 1 mg/mL in water and desalted/concentrated using 0.6 µL C18 reversed-phase ZipTips (EMD Millipore #ZTC18S096) to avoid ion suppression (i.e. buffer containing 250 mM NaCl and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The desalted samples were mixed 1:1 with super-DHB matrix (Sigma #50862; prepared at 50 mg/mL in 50/50 solution of acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) for spotting on ground steel targets (dried droplet method). The co-crystallized samples were analyzed in linear positive mode (intact mass) or reflector positive mode (rapid top-down sequencing / in-source decay) using an UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF system (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) operated by FlexControl (v3.4 software). Relative ion intensities were evaluated in FlexAnalysis (v3.4 software) by averaging four measurements of 500 shots each (i.e. 2,000 shots total per sample for TOF intact mass) or four measurements of 4,000 shots each (i.e. 16,000 shots total per sample for TOF/TOF top-down sequencing). The amino acid sequences for BSA (standard) or ACPD39R/E42A(apo or holo samples) were aligned with the in-source decay (ISD) spectra in BioTools (v3.2 software).

The host factors (20 or 25 µM with or without TnsD respectively) were pre incubated with or without TnsD (1 µM) on ice for 40 min in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA and 5% glycerol) to a final reaction volume of 10 µL. Mixtures were resolved on 5% non-denaturing Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gels for 40 min (reactions without TnsD) or 50 min (reactions with TnsD) on an ice bath and at a constant voltage of 100 V using TG-running buffer (25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (G-250, MP Biomedicals) for 20 min and destained overnight before imaging using a GelDoc Go imager system (BioRad).

The AlphaFold predictions for TnsD (AF-P13991-F1), uL29 (AF-P0A7M6-F1) and ACP (AF-P0A6A8-F1) were downloaded from the AlphaFold database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk). Three-dimensional predictions were generated with AlphaFold multimer using the COSMIC2 platform or AlphaFold3 on the AlphaFold Server with default parameters [12,13]. The Uniprot entriesP0A6A8(ACP),P0A7M6(uL29) andP13991(TnsD) were used as input sequences. For the protein-DNA sequences, DNA sequences spanning the + 23 to + 58 (5’TTACTCAACCGTAA CCGATTTTGCCAGGTTACGCGG3’and5’CCGCGTAACCTGGCAAAATCGGTTAACGGTTGAGTAA3’) and the − 5 to + 64 (regions of theattTn7site were used or from the − 5 to + 64 ofattTn7:5’TGCCCCGCTTACGCAGGGCATCCATTTATTACTCAACCGTAACCGATTTTGCCAGGTTACGCGGCTGGTC3’and5’GACCAGCCGCGTAACCTGGCAAAATCGGTTACGGTTGAGTA ATAAATGGATGCCCTGCGTAAGCGGGGCA3’). The resulting predictions were compared in PyMOL. Side-chain atoms at the ACP: uL29, ACP: TnsD, and uL29:TnsD interfaces and at distances shorter than 3.5 Å were considered when designing the uL29 and ACP variants. Images showing structures were generated with either PyMOL or ChimeraX.

TnsD is a multidomain protein that specifically recognizes the 3’ end of theglmSgene [4], and recruits TnsC for Tn7 transposition (Fig.1a). The N-terminal domain of TnsD (residues 1-318, TnsDNTD) mediates the interaction with TnsC [5] and binds DNA in a sequence unspecific but length-dependent manner [6], suggesting that the C-terminal domain of the protein must drive DNA-binding specificity of TnsD.

TnsDNTDcan be easily produced recombinantly and is well-behaved in solution [6]. However, full-length TnsD is predominantly insoluble when over-produced in different cell lines even when using standard additives in the lysis buffer. We extracted full-length TnsD from the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate by adding 2 M urea and 0.5% tween-20 to the resuspension buffer and purified in the absence of denaturing agents (Fig.1b). In these conditions, TnsD was soluble at low concentrations but prone to aggregation. To confirm that TnsD retained its native fold, we compared its binding to FAM-labeled 36-bp DNA substrates either spanning the + 23 to + 58 region of theattTn7site or with a random sequence. We found that TnsD readily bound to theattTn7site fragment (Fig.1c, top panel, lanes 1–5) but bound only weakly to the control DNA (Fig.1c, top panel, lanes 1–5). In contrast, the N-terminal domain binds the two DNA sequences similarly (Fig.1c, bottom panel) [6]. Quantification of the electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that TnsDNTDbound DNA similarly to full-length TnsD but without sequence specificity (Fig.1d).

To determine the effects of acyl carrier protein (ACP) and the ribosomal protein uL29, we produced and purified them to homogeneity (Fig.2a). ACP eluted as two different species from ionic exchange chromatography (Suppl. Fig.S2a). ACP is activated by the addition of a phosphopantetheine group (4′-PP) to Ser36 (Kim et al., 2006). Using mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the two species corresponded to the “inactive” (apo-ACP) and “active” (holo-ACP) forms of the protein (Suppl. Fig.S2b). To assess whether the 4′-PP is important for the effect of ACP on TnsD, we isolated the two forms of ACP and assayed independently.

We first incubated TnsD with FAM-labeled 36-bpattTn7DNA and each host factor individually or combined and resolved the species using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We found that individual addition of the host factors did not affect the migration of the DNA-bound species, suggesting that they do not bind stably to the TnsD:attTn7complex (Fig.2b, lanes 3–5). However, simultaneous addition of both host factors resulted in the formation of a slower-migrating species, indicating that either the two host factors bind coordinately to the TnsD:attTn7complex or change the architecture of the TnsD:attTn7complex (Fig.2b, lanes 6–7). The former is consistent with previous work showing that, while uL29 could bind weakly to the TnsD:attTn7complex, the presence of ACP greatly enhanced the interaction [9]. This change in electrophoretic mobility was induced by both apo- and holo-ACP (Fig.2b, compare lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that the modification does not impact formation of the complex with uL29 and TnsD on DNA. To confirm the new species was the result of the uL29 and ACP interacting with the TnsD:attTn7complex rather than the host factors independently interacting with DNA, we incubated excess uL29 and ACP withattTn7in the absence of TnsD and no binding was detected (Fig.2c, lane 2). Incubation with excess host factors did not result in additional (non-specific) DNA bound species (Fig.2c, lanes 6–8), suggesting that their effect was specific. Interestingly, addition of ACP and uL29 did not change the electrophoretic mobility of the TnsDNTD:DNA complexes (Fig.2d), indirectly suggesting that ACP and uL29 associate through the C-terminal domain of the protein.

We next wanted to assay whether uL29 and ACP interacted with TnsD in the absence of DNA. To this end, we analyzed various combinations of TnsD and host factors using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Native PAGE). The ribosomal uL29 protein (pI = 9.98) is positively charged and, therefore, does not enter the gel (Fig.3a, lane 1). In contrast, the ACP (pI = 4.1) is negatively charged and migrates well into the gel (Fig.3a, lanes 2–3). Like uL29, TnsD alone does not enter the gel either but the complexes of TnsD and uL29:ACP can be resolved in this assay (Fig.3a, lane 4). When both ACP and uL29 were combined with TnsD, we identified the formation of two new species that migrated differently than the individual components. The fastest migrating species probably corresponds to the ACP: uL29 complex as it is observed both in the absence and presence of TnsD (Fig.3a, compare lanes 5 and 6). This occurred with both apo and holo ACP, although the band was better defined when uL29 was mixed with apo ACP (Fig.3a, compare lanes 5 and 7). The second species was only visible when TnsD was present, indicating that the three proteins interact even in the absence of DNA (Fig.3a, lanes 6 and 8). However, the bands for the complexes are diffuse, suggesting that the complex is not stable under these conditions.

We next tested whether uL29 and ACP improved the behavior of TnsD in solution. TnsD is highly unstable even at low concentrations and readily precipitates while being concentrated using centrifugal devices. This behavior provided a mechanism to assess if ACP and uL29 stabilized TnsD. We mixed TnsD (280 nM) with host factors in a 1:5:5 molar ratio (TnsD: uL29:apoACP) and incubated for 30 min on ice. A TnsD sample at the same concentration without host factors was used as a control. Both samples were concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cutoff of 30 kDa to allow unbound uL29 (7.4 kDa) and ACP (8.8 kDa) to flow through the membrane. TnsD remained in solution at higher concentrations in the presence of the host factors (Fig.3b compare lanes 2–4 to 5–7), indicating that the host factors alleviate TnsD’s tendency to aggregate. Both ACP and uL29 were retained in the concentrated fraction though uL29 was only visible when the gel was silver stained (Fig.3b, inset), suggesting that the TnsD: uL29:apoACP complex is likely labile in the absence of DNA.

Encouraged by these results, we used AlphaFold (AF) to predict the putative interfaces mediating the TnsD:uL29:ACP interaction. We generated AF predictions for the interaction of TnsD with uL29 and ACP on their own and in the presence of DNA (Suppl. Figure3). Both predictions return similar results for the individual domains of TnsD and interfaces for the TnsD: uL29:ACP interaction (Suppl. Figure3a and3d). The relative orientation between TnsD domains is predicted with higher confidence when DNA is present (Suppl. Figure3b-c and3e-f). However, this prediction places the DNA duplex with incorrect polarity and does not support previously published data describing how TnsD interacts with theattTn7site [14]. Inclusion of the TnsC heptamer in the prediction corrects the DNA polarity while maintaining identical interactions between TnsD, ACP and uL29 (Suppl. Figure3g-i).

In all predictions, ACP and uL29 interact with the C-terminal domain of TnsD (Fig.3c and Suppl. Figure3). This domain of TnsD (residues 389–506) has a positively charged patch defined by Arg397, Arg401, Arg405, Lys408, Arg409 and Arg450 that cradle helix a2 of ACP (Figs.3c-d and4a). Reciprocally, ACP helix a2 is at the core of its very acidic central region (14 acidic and no positive residues between residues 30–60) and is often called the “recognition helix” for universal enzyme interactions [15,16]. Adjacent to this positively-charged region of TnsD, there is a negatively-charged patch defined by residues Asp411, Glu453, Glu456, Asp457, Glu495, Glu496 that interact with helices a2 and a3 of uL29 through electrostatic interactions with Arg29, Arg47, and Lys54 (Figs.3d and5a). The interaction is further stabilized through van der Waals interactions between the C-terminal end of helix a2 in uL29 and the terminal helix bundle of TnsD. AlphaFold returned similar predictions for the TnsD: ACP and TnsD: uL29 interactions, indicating that the interactions with ACP and uL29 are primarily driven by reciprocal electrostatic interactions.

While AlphaFold does not precisely predict interactions at the residue level, we engineered point mutations in ACP at positions in which side chains where at a distance from uL29 and TnsD and in an orientation compatible with hydrogen-bond formation. Since ACP does not interact with TnsD in the absence of uL29, we focused on residues that could bridge the interaction between the two proteins. Based on the AlphaFold predictions, residues Asp39 and Glu42 from ACP bridge the interaction with TnsD and uL29. Asp39 connects Arg450 (TnsD) and Arg48 (uL29), while Glu42 bridges Lys 44 and Arg48 in uL29 to Tyr451 in TnsD (Fig.4a). Therefore, we generated the ACPD39R/E42Avariant to probe the interaction (Fig.4a). This variant expressed well and was purified similarly to wild-type ACP. The presence of apo- and holo- ACPD39R/E42Awas confirmed using Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (Suppl. Fig.S4).

Using native PAGE, we found that apo- and holo- ACPD39R/E42Ano longer interacted with uL29 (Fig.4b, lanes 7 and 9). We then used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to see if this variant also abrogated the interaction with TnsD. We found that neither apo- nor holo- ACPD39R/E42Awere able to interact with the TnsD:attTn7complex (Fig.4c-d, lanes 4–8). These results indicate that ACP “recognition helix” (helix a2) is important for the interactions with uL29 and TnsD. However, they do not rule out if the effect is direct (i.e. the helix mediates the interaction with both proteins) or indirect in which disruption of one interaction also abolishes the other one.

The interface of uL29 and TnsD (893 Å2) is more extensive than that with ACP (337 Å2) and involves different surfaces of the protein, providing an opportunity to check the contributions of the different interfaces to complex formation. We designed uL29 variants that could disrupt the interactions with ACP and TnsD independently. Based on the AlphaFold prediction, the uL29R47A/R48S/K54Avariant should abrogate the interaction with both TnsD and ACP, whereas the uL29K2A/R52Aand uL29R47A/K54Avariants would disrupt the interactions with either ACP or TnsD, respectively (Fig.5a). We then tested whether the three variants could form a complex with ACP (Fig.5b-d) and bind to the TnsD:attTn7complex (Fig.5e-g). As expected, the uL29R47A/R48S/K54Avariant, designed to disrupt the interactions with both TnsD and ACP, did not interact with ACP (Fig.5b, lanes 6 and 8), and did not change the migration of the TnsD:attTn7complex (Fig.5e, lanes 4–8).

In good agreement with the Alphafold prediction, the uL29K2A/R52Avariant did not interact with ACP as judged by native PAGE (Fig.5c, lanes 6 and 8). However, native PAGE showed a diffuse band where the uL29:ACP: TnsD would migrate suggesting that uL29 and ACP might interact simultaneously with TnsD even if they do not form a stable complex with each other (Fig.5c, lanes 7–8). Accordingly, the uL29K2A/R52Avariant changed the migration of the TnsD:attTn7complex, albeit less effectively than wild type uL29 (Fig.5f, lanes 4–8), indicating that the interaction between both host factors is necessary to form a stable uL29:ACP: TnsD:attTn7complex. We only detected an interaction with the TnsD:attTn7complex when both host factors were present (Fig.2b, lanes 6–7) but it has been previously published that uL29 –but not ACP– can interact weakly with the TnsD:attTn7complex on its own, although the presence of ACP greatly enhanced uL29 binding to the TnsD:attTn7complex [9]. These results support the idea that the uL29:ACP: TnsD:attTn7complex is stabilized by the simultaneous binding of both host factors but binding of uL29 may not necessitate ACP.

Lastly, we tested the uL29R47A/K54Avariant. This variant was designed to disrupt the uL29:TnsD interface without disrupting the uL29:ACP interface. However, uL29R47A/K54Adid not interact with ACP nor TnsD (Fig.5d, lanes 6 and 8) and did not change the migration of the TnsD:attTn7complex (Fig.5g, lanes 4–8). These results recapitulated the behaviour of the uL29R47A/R48S/K54Avariant, indicating that either Arg47 or Lys54 (most likely Arg47 based on their location) is also important for the interaction with ACP or that disrupting the uL29:TnsD interface precludes binding to ACP. The uL29:TnsD interface occludes a surface area of ~ 900 Å2, while the ACP: TnsD interface is significantly smaller (630 Å2). Therefore, it is plausible that uL29 anchors the interaction to TnsD while ACP further stabilizes the complex.

All Tn7 elements encode at least one target-site selection protein from the TniQ/TnsD family. In the prototypical element, TnsD is composed of a conserved N-terminal domain characteristic of the TniQ/TnsD family, and a variable C-terminal region responsible for recognizing theattTn7site [6]. While the TniQ domain of the protein has been characterized, the poor solubility and aggregation propensity of the full-length protein has precluded the mechanistic understanding. Previous studies revealed that uL29 and ACP can enhance Tn7 transposition efficiency in vitro [9]. We now show that uL29 and ACP coordinately stabilize TnsD and interact through the C-terminal domain of the protein. We also find that both host factors are necessary for the interaction, but they have independent roles with uL29 anchoring the interaction and ACP stabilizing the complex.

Recent structural studies have revealed that the ribosomal protein uS15 is an integral component of the V-K CAST target-site selection complex [10]. The uS15 protein interacts with the tracrRNA rooftop loop and stabilizes the crRNA in a conformation that supports TniQ recruitment [10]. In contrast, ACP and uL29 stabilize TnsD through direct protein-protein interactions and their binding does not preclude the interaction with theattTn7site. It is possible that uL29 and ACP indirectly help remodel theattTn7site but based in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays and the AlphaFold3 prediction of the complex, they do not interact directly with DNA (Fig.2c,6a and Suppl. Fig.S2a-c). In the structure of the TnsD-mediated targeting complex from the type I-B2 CAST element [8], the C-terminal region of TnsD packs the DNA against the N-terminal domain and imposes a sharp bend by intercalating Arg445 into the CC/GG step at position + 32 (Fig.6b and (Suppl. Fig.S1b)). This is quite different from the AlphaFold prediction of the uL29:ACP: TnsD:attTn7complex and the structure of the TnsC:TnsD:DNA complex from the prototypical Tn7 element (Fig.6) [6], where the DNA bending is imposed by the N-terminal domain of TnsD as it recruits the TnsC ring ((Suppl. Fig.S1a)). However, TnsD from the type I-B2 CAST system recognizes a different attachment site than TnsD from prototypical Tn7 element, and the structure was determined in the absence of host factors. Therefore, the recognition mode could be different for the two systems.

AlphaFold predictions have become a useful tool to interpret data from biochemical and biophysical techniques, however they should be interpreted with caution. The AlphaFold models calculated including different components of the target-site selection complex consistently predict similar interactions between uL29, ACP, and TnsD ((Suppl. Fig.S1)). However, when DNA is included in the predictions, theattTn7site is modeled with opposite polarity (Fig.6a). Including TnsC into the prediction corrects the issue and keeps uL29:ACP: TnsD in a similar orientation (Fig.6a). However, the resulting model fails to explain the DNA-binding specificity of TnsD [4]. Mutations at positions + 31, +33, + 43, +45, + 51 and + 54 ofattTn7reduce significantly TnsD binding [4]. Accordingly, mutations at these positions also blocked transposition in vivo [4]. In the AlphaFold model, the C-terminal domain of TnsD (residues 389–508) interacts with uL29:ACP and footprints the + 20 to + 33 region of theattTn7site with the preceding linker (residues 381–388) and intervening folded domain (residues 317–380) extending the footprint to position + 48 of theattTn7(Fig.6a). Understanding how the Tn7 TnsD-mediated target-site selection complex protects the region of theattTn7site beyond position + 48 will necessitate further structural validation.

This work, together with that from others, expands the roles of host factors in Tn7 transposition. We show that TnsD from prototypical Tn7 is prone to aggregation, but it is partially mitigated by the interaction withEscherichia colihost factors, uL29 and ACP. Other Tn7-like elements use host factors to stabilize the RNA conformation in the targeting complex [10,17], or facilitate the integration step by bending DNA [18]. Understanding if all Tn7 elements use host factors to optimize the targeting and insertion events or only some have exploited this resource awaits future proteomics and structural characterization.
