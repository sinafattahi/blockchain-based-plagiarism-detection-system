To assess the comparative effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children, and to evaluate the relative rankings for benefits and harms of mAbs for preventing RSV in children.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen to cause lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children, and these infections are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in young children [1,2]. RSV alone accounts for 33 million acute LRTIs, 3.6 million hospitalisations, and 101,000 deaths globally each year amongst children under five years old [3]. It is the second leading cause of infant deaths worldwide after malaria [2].

RSV is a single‐stranded, negative‐sense, enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus [4]. It belongs to thePneumoviridaefamily andOrthopneumovirusgenus [5]. Transmission occurs through contact with infected surfaces or hands or direct contact with respiratory secretions, and the incubation period is three to five days [1]. By the age of two, 90% of infants and young children have been infected. Symptoms of RSV‐induced upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) include rhinitis, cough, nasal congestion, and sometimes fever, while symptoms of RSV‐induced LRTI include bronchiolitis or pneumonia with dyspnoea, difficulty feeding, wheezing, or apnoea [1]. In temperate regions, RSV is distinctly seasonal, peaking during the colder season. In tropical and subtropical climates, RSV is less predictable and can occur throughout the year [4]. Depending on the geographic location, there are differences in the severity of the disease, primarily attributed to socioeconomic, environmental, and genetic factors [1]. The most severe forms tend to occur in children with underlying chronic conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia; children with congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, Down's syndrome, or immunodeficiency; infants younger than three months; and preterm infants. Mortality is higher in children hospitalised with RSV in low‐income countries versus high‐income countries [1,4,6].

Palivizumab (SYNAGIS), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against RSV, was approved in 1998 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and soon after by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the prevention of RSV disease in infants born before 29 weeks' gestational age and older infants with certain baseline risk factors [7,8]. For many years, palivizumab was the main mAb treatment strategy, as phase III clinical trials of other mAbs (motavizumab and suptavumab) produced insufficient evidence to support their use [9,10] (seeTable 1).

Nirsevimab (Beyfortus) was approved in 2022 by the EMA and in 2023 by the FDA. Compared with palivizumab, the key innovations are a longer half‐life, enabling single‐dose administration rather than monthly dosing, and demonstrated efficacy in healthy newborns and infants born at any gestational age, expanding the target population [11]. A new mAb, clesrovimab (MK‐1654), is currently being studied [12], with promising interim efficacy results [13].

For many years, the prohibitive cost of palivizumab limited its prescription, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) [14]. At present, the cost remains high at USD (US dollar) 1416 per 100 mg [14,15], and economic analyses of its cost‐effectiveness are discordant [8,15]. Although nirsevimab costs less in the USA (USD 520 per 50/100 mg and USD 1040 per 200 mg [16]), the price varies by country and remains unaffordable for most in low‐income countries, which crucially affects access and cost‐effectiveness [17,18,19].

All available or studied mAbs target specific regions of the fusion (F) glycoprotein with different affinities [10,20,21,22,23,24]. Binding with the F protein leads to an inhibition of RSV replication. The different binding affinities and half‐life are related to mAb dosage. Of note, mAbs provide passive immunisation but do not activate the immune system or induce immunological memory, and the length of protection depends on the mAb half‐life [25,26]. SeeTable 1for additional information regarding mAbs of interest in this review.

Since the publication of previous Cochrane reviews on this topic, new mAbs have been developed or are nearing approval for preventing RSV disease, offering promising alternatives to existing options like palivizumab [14,27]. These newer mAbs, with their long‐lasting protection and convenient single‐dose administration, are increasingly being utilised and considered for immunising healthy children. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended that all countries introduce passive immunisation to prevent severe RSV disease in young infants, with or without other RSV prevention tools such as the newly available maternal vaccine [28].

The speed of advances in medical research and the high uptake of new molecules preclude head‐to‐head comparisons. Given the high cost of mAbs, it is essential to know which ones effectively prevent RSV disease in high‐risk children. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several surveillance systems observed a dramatic increase in RSV hospitalisations, which led to a shortage of paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds. This was probably due to a reduction in circulating viruses during the first phase of the pandemic, which highlights the importance of mAbs to prevent RSV infection in children.

The persistent high burden of RSV globally, especially since the COVID‐19 pandemic, underscores the need for regularly updated reviews [29]. Countries require reliable evidence to identify the RSV prevention strategies best suited to their contexts, needs, and resources. Furthermore, the global demand for more affordable, accessible, and widely accepted mAbs highlights the importance of comprehensive information to support global immunisation efforts and inform policy decisions.

To assess the comparative effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children, and to evaluate the relative rankings for benefits and harms of mAbs for preventing RSV in children.

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the review [30]. For reporting, we will follow PRISMA 2020 and the PRISMA for Network Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA‐NMA) extension [31,32].

We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We will exclude: cross‐over RCTs, as they are irrelevant to the review question; cluster‐RCTs, to avoid within‐cluster contamination and threats to the transitivity assumption [33]; and quasi‐RCTs (trials using inappropriate strategies of allocating interventions). We will include studies reported as full text, those published as abstracts only, and unpublished data where it is possible to establish eligibility for inclusion. There will be no date or language restrictions.

We will include studies focusing on children from birth to 24 months of age of any sex, regardless of RSV infection history. We will exclude studies focusing on children with immunodeficiency disorders or cystic fibrosis, as they would threaten the plausibility of the transitivity assumption and, thus, the validity of indirect comparison. We will exclude studies focusing on children whose mothers received maternal vaccination for RSV during pregnancy, as the CDC recommends either maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy or mAb administration (in particular nirsevimab) for the infant to prevent RSV disease, but most infants do not need both [34,35].

We will include studies in which only a subset of participants is relevant to this review if separate data are available for eligible participants, or if more than 80% of participants meet our eligibility criteria.

We will include trials comparing any mAb for the prevention of RSV infection with placebo, no intervention, or standard care. We will include any dose or route of administration (intramuscular, intravenous infusion, or intranasal spray), as defined by the study authors.

We will include one or more of the following interventions in our decision set.

If we find a trial using any other mAb, we will add additional nodes to the decision set.

Figure 1shows a preview of the nodes. We will merge different doses or routes of administration for the same drug in the same node so that the nodes in the network structure will represent each medication, unless this affects the network's coherence [36].

We will include co‐interventions, like standard care (oxygen supplementation, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, etc.), provided they are not part of the randomised treatment and are consistent across groups.

We will exclude studies focusing on maternal vaccination. Although maternal immunisation protects infants through passive immunity, its mechanism of action involves boosting the mother's pre‐existing antibodies, which are then transferred to the infant, providing protection via polyclonal antibodies. Furthermore, maternal vaccination involves administering the intervention to the mothers, and not directly to the infant, differing in the delivery timing and the target population addressed in this review and affecting the transitivity assumption [34].

Reporting of our prespecified outcomes will not be a study eligibility criterion. However, we will exclude studies if we have evidence (e.g. through contact with trial authors or access to the original protocol) that they measured none of our outcomes of interest.

We will consider outcomes measured up to 12 months after randomisation as short‐term and those measured after 12 months as long‐term. If any studies report multiple results for the same outcome, we will include the longest follow‐up.

There are no reported minimally important difference (MID) thresholds for our dichotomous outcomes; therefore, we will define the MID as a relative risk reduction of at least 25% (37;38).

Adverse events: any unexpected or harmful occurrence in the participant, such as rash, pain at the injection site, fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea, reported in absolute numbers or proportions. We will try to report non‐serious and serious adverse events (e.g. death, disability, life‐threatening events or those requiring hospitalisation) separately.

RSV‐specific outpatient medically attended LRTI (MALRI): cases of LRTIs explicitly caused by RSV requiring medical attention in an outpatient setting. It includes symptoms like wheezing, increased respiratory effort, or hypoxia with confirmed RSV infection, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen‐based testing, without hospitalisation.

An Information Specialist (CEL) will develop search strategies in the following databases from their inception, without restrictions on date, language, or publication status.

We will employ Cochrane‐validated search filters to retrieve clinical trials in MEDLINE (sensitivity‐maximising version), and in Embase (highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised trials, 2023 review); both filters are designed for the Ovid search interface [39].

Supplementary material 1presents our search strategies.

We will search for errata or retractions in included studies.

Two review authors (LG, IE, CR, or ML) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of all records returned by the search and eliminate those that are clearly irrelevant. Next, we will retrieve the full‐text publications of all potentially eligible records, and two review authors (LG, IE, CR, or ML) will independently assess them against our eligibility criteria, recording reasons for excluding ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion or, if required, by consulting a third review author (MB or JVAF). We will identify and exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review.

We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram [31]. We will use Covidence software for study selection [40], and Endnote for deduplication [41].

Two review authors (LG, IE, CR, or ML) will independently extract, assess, and code all data for each study using a standardised form developed in Microsoft Excel, which will be piloted on at least one study in the review. We will resolve any disagreements through consensus. A second review author (MB or JVAF) will check data extraction.

We will report these data in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table and summarise them in an 'Overview of included studies and synthesis' table (seeTable 2).

We will calculate or convert the reported data to the required format for meta‐analysis when needed, following guidance from Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[42,43]. We will resolve disagreements by discussion or by involving a third review author (MB or JVAF).

In the event of duplicate publications, companion documents, or multiple reports of a primary study, we will maximise the information yield by mapping all publications to unique studies and collating all available data. We will use the most complete data set aggregated across all known publications. In case of doubt, we will prioritise the publication reporting the longest follow‐up associated with our outcomes.

Two review authors (LG, IE, CR, or ML) will independently assess the risk of bias for our main outcomes (those included in the summary of findings table; seeCertainty of the evidence assessment) in each study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) [44]. We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author (MB or JVAF). RoB 2 covers the following domains.

Answers to signalling questions and supporting information will collectively lead to a domain‐level judgement ('low risk of bias', 'some concerns', or 'high risk of bias'). These domain‐level judgements will inform an overall risk of bias judgement for the outcome. We will consider the algorithm‐proposed judgements and provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgement in the risk of bias table. We will also provide reasons for judgements that do not follow the algorithm. We will summarise the risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed. When judging 'Bias due to deviations from intended interventions', we will focus the analyses on the effect of assignment to intervention [45]. We will aim to source published study protocols for the assessment of selective reporting. Where information on the risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the risk of bias table.

We will use the RoB 2 Excel tool (available at www.riskofbias.info/) to manage the data supporting the answers to the signalling questions and risk of bias judgements. All these data will be publicly available as supplementary material in the Open Science Framework platform (osf.io/).

We will use risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes (as all are dichotomous). We will present results from the network meta‐analysis (NMA) as summary relative effect sizes for each possible pair of treatments.

We will obtain a treatment hierarchy using P scores for all review outcomes [46]. P scores measure the mean extent of certainty that the underlying treatment effect is larger than that of any other intervention.

The unit of analysis will be the participating infant in all trials, as cluster‐RCTs are ineligible for inclusion in this review. We will include multiarm trials and account for the correlation between the effect estimates in the NMA. We will treat multiarm studies as multiple independent comparisons in pairwise meta‐analyses and not combine these in any analysis. We will include only the arms with comparisons relevant to prespecified nodes in our network.

We will request missing data (e.g. absolute frequencies) from study authors. For our analyses, we will conduct available‐case analyses, considering these issues when assessing the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. We will investigate attrition rates (e.g. dropouts, losses to follow‐up, withdrawals) and critically appraise issues of missing data. We will not impute missing data.

We will attempt to obtain study protocols to assess the presence of selective outcome reporting.

If we can pool more than 10 trials, we will create and examine comparison‐adjusted funnel plots to explore possible small‐study effects and publication biases (47). We will interpret the results carefully, as asymmetry in funnel plots may have several explanations besides publication bias. If searches identify trial protocols, clinical trial registrations, or abstracts indicating the existence of unpublished studies, we will attempt to determine their status by contacting the investigators.

We will consider outcome reporting bias in our risk of bias assessments.

We will conduct conventional pairwise meta‐analyses with a random‐effects model in RevMan [48] for each comparison and outcome with at least two studies, following guidance in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[49,50]. We will calculate corresponding 95% CIs for all effect measures, and we will graphically present the results using forest plots. We will use a random‐effects model because we expect clinical diversity. We will use the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method to estimate between‐trial variance. We will use the Hartung‐Knapp‐Sidik‐Jonkman method to calculate a CI for the meta‐analysis effect estimate when there are at least three studies and the estimate of heterogeneity is greater than zero. In other scenarios (i.e. in pooled analyses of two studies, or where the estimate of heterogeneity is equal to zero), we will use the Wald‐type method. When trials are clinically too heterogeneous to be combined, we will perform only subgroup analyses without calculating an overall estimate.

We will perform frequentist NMA for each outcome with a random‐effects model using the network suite of commands [51,52] in Stata 16 [53]. We will estimate the within‐network heterogeneity across comparisons using the REML method (54). Each NMA treatment effect estimate will be presented along with a 95% CI and a 95% predictive interval (PrI). A PrI is an interval within which the treatment effect estimate of a future study is expected to lie, accounting for both uncertainty of the treatment effect and between‐study variance estimates [55,56].

We will estimate how likely all treatments are to be ranked at each possible position for each intervention. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve to rank effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive interventions [57]. SUCRA accounts for both effect size magnitude and uncertainty around the underlying effect size. We will use the rank‐heat plot to present SUCRA values for all outcomes in a single plot [54]. We will display results (network plot and league table) using the 'network graph package' in Stata [58].

We will identify heterogeneity through visual inspection of forest plots, assessing the amount of overlap of CIs, and by calculating the I² statistic, which quantifies between‐study variation across studies. To interpret I² values, we will use this rough guide outlined in Chapter 10 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[49].

50% to 90%: may indicate substantial heterogeneity.

We will avoid using absolute cutoff values but interpret I² values in relation to the size and direction of effects and the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi2test or CI for I²).

Before conducting an NMA, we will assess the transitivity assumption. NMA rests on the assumption of transitivity, that effect modifiers have a comparable distribution across treatment comparisons in a network [59,60]. To assess the plausibility of this assumption, we will visually inspect the comparability of distributions of age, sex, place of residence, presence of comorbidities, and overall risk of bias as potential treatment effect modifiers across comparisons [61]. We will assess the similarity of inclusion and exclusion criteria of all studies, including participants, treatments, and outcomes, to evaluate whether they impact treatment effects.

We will assess the statistical agreement between direct and indirect evidence by assessing the presence of local and global inconsistency. We will evaluate each network locally using the loop‐specific method by generating an inconsistency factor and a 95% CI for each closed loop [62]. We will also apply a global assessment for consistency in each network using the design‐by‐treatment interaction model [51]. If inconsistency is found, we will follow the guidance provided in Chapter 11 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[63].

We plan to conduct the following subgroup analyses for our critical outcomes.

High‐risk children (e.g. children with heart disease, respiratory diseases, infants younger than three months, premature children, children with immunodeficiency, children with low birth weight) versus average‐risk children. We based this analysis on the different disease risks in each subgroup, as children with underlying conditions tend to suffer more from RSV infection [1,4,6].

Tropical regions versus non‐tropical regions. We based this analysis on the differences in case distribution, as temperate regions usually have higher incidence during the colder season, and tropical and subtropical climates have less predictable RSV incidence, with cases occurring throughout the year [4].

High‐income countries versus low‐ and middle‐income countries. We based this analysis on the different disease severities related to geographic and socioeconomic factors [1].

We will use the Chi² test to test for subgroup interactions, following the guidance in Chapter 10 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[49].

We will explore health inequity using the PROGRESS‐Plus framework [64], and following the guidance in Chapter 16 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[65]. This will involve subgroup analyses based on basal RSV infection risk, country income classification, and place of residence (seeInvestigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis).Supplementary material 3describes the equity‐related characteristics of participants that will guide interpretation of the results.

We plan to perform a sensitivity analysis of the critical outcomes to explore the influence of risk of bias (when applicable) on the effect sizes. To do this, we will restrict the analysis to studies at an overall low risk of bias.

We will follow the Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA) approach and use six criteria (within‐study bias, reporting bias, indirectness, imprecision, heterogeneity, and incoherence) to evaluate the certainty of evidence related to studies that contribute data to the meta‐analysis for each prespecified outcome [66]. Two review authors (LG, MB) will independently make judgements about certainty of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low). We will resolve disagreements by discussion or consultation with a third review author (JVAF).

We will use summary of findings tables to summarise key results of the review using the CINeMA framework and software [61,63,67]. The summary of findings tables will present the following outcomes.

We will create a summary of findings table for each outcome using the approach presented by Yepes‐Nuñez (68).

We will involve consumers in all stages of the review. We will include one patient representative (ML) and several health professionals (CR, IE, MB) related to paediatric care.Supplementary material 2provides more information.
