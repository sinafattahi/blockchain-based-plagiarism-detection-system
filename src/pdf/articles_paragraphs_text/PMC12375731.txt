The effective treatment of oil-contaminated wastewater is a critical environmental challenge. This study demonstrates a robust pathway for synthesizing high-performance activated carbon (AC) from date palm seed waste for the removal of crude oil. A two-step process involving pyrolysis and subsequent KOH chemical activation was systematically optimized by varying key parameters, including temperature, time, and impregnation ratio. The optimized adsorbent, AC5 (prepared at a 4:1 KOH: biochar ratio, 700 °C, for 2 h), exhibited a high surface area of 2151 m²/g and an exceptional crude oil adsorption capacity of 1816 mg/g. A key finding is that maximum surface area alone does not dictate performance for complex adsorbates; AC5 significantly outperformed a sample with a higher surface area (2417 m²/g), a result attributed to its more favorable surface chemistry as confirmed by FTIR analysis. The adsorption process was best described by the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Crucially, the performance of the optimized AC represents an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude over previously reported date-seed carbons for oil removal and surpasses that of many other biomass-derived adsorbents. This work establishes a clear synthesis pathway for valorizing an abundant agricultural waste into a superior adsorbent for oil spill remediation.

Oil remains a primary energy resource and is expected to remain dominant as a fuel source for many years1. Oil spills commonly occur, often inadvertently, during exploration, production, and transportation2. According to estimates, 224,000 tons of oil were released into the world’s seas due to oil tanker incidents during the first decade of the 21st century3. The most notable environmental disaster was most likely the Deepwater Horizon oil spill caused by British Petroleum, lasting around three months, killing 11 people, and leaking an estimated 3 million barrels of oil into the Mexico Gulf. The resulting contamination irreversibly damaged the surrounding aquatic ecosystem. In the past, leaks of petroleum products have in fact resulted in several ecological disasters, including the Gulf of Mexico drilling rig accidents in 1970 and 1971, the Piper Alpha platform calamity in the North Sea in 1978, and the Exxon Valdez leakage in Alaska in 19894. Furthermore, industrial effluent streams, frequently contaminated with residual oil, are released into bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, leading to irrevocable harm to ecological systems and public health5. The ecological damage caused by oil and related petrochemicals is so serious that a single liter of benzene could contaminate several million gallons of water, rendering it unfit for consumption1. Therefore, there is an immediate and urgent need to develop efficient, economical methods for the processing of oil-contaminated effluents.

Various techniques have been utilized for oily wastewater treatment. Some examples are the oil containment booms, oil skimmers, oxidation, pumping and burning on the water surface, reverse osmosis, filtration, various flotation methods, adsorption, activated sludge treatment, membrane bioreactors, biological treatment, coagulation, and coalescence6,7. Adsorption is a physical treatment technique wherein a phase (called the adsorbate) is adhered to the surface of a material (called the adsorbent). Compared to alternative treatment methods, adsorption is an effective separation method due to its ease of operation, flexibility in process design, regeneration potential, low capital investment, and its efficiency in removing contaminants across a broad concentration range8–10. Furthermore, it has been shown that, when compared to alternative techniques, adsorption is the most suitable technique to remove crude oil contamination11.

Various adsorbents—such as activated carbons, biochar, clays and minerals, resins and polymers, nanoparticles, and composite materials—have been proposed for the removal of oily and other organic contaminants from water. While each type of adsorbent offers unique advantages and application potential, naturally derived organic materials, particularly those sourced from biomass, are considered among the most cost-effective due to their abundance and ease of accessibility. Moreover, carbon-based materials remain a preferred choice for addressing a wide range of complex adsorption challenges, owing to their high adsorption efficiency11.

Activated carbon (AC), also known as activated biochar, is an amorphous, non-graphitic carbon material produced by activating carbon-rich feedstocks with a high carbon content12. Its exceptional adsorption capacity for contaminants is primarily attributed to its large specific surface area, extensive microporous structure, stable thermal properties, and chemically active surface functionalities9,13–15. As a result, AC is widely employed in applications such as water purification, industrial effluent treatment, air and gas filtration, and the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) )16. Notably, activated carbon has demonstrated outstanding performance in the removal of crude oil from contaminated water. Its high surface area and well-developed porosity enable the efficient adsorption of substantial amounts of crude oil and a broad spectrum of organic pollutants. Available in various forms—such as granular and powdered—AC can be integrated into different treatment configurations, including fixed-bed and fluidized-bed systems, thereby enhancing its operational flexibility. In addition to its adsorption efficiency, activated carbon is valued for its chemical stability and its capacity for regeneration and reuse, which significantly improves its cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability in long-term wastewater treatment applications. These unique properties make activated carbon a promising choice for addressing complex oil contamination issues in wastewater systems17,18.

The characteristics of activated carbon are greatly affected by the nature of the precursor and its pretreatment and activation processes. Agricultural biomass is an attractive feedstock for the large-scale manufacture of affordable activated carbon due to its wide availability, sustainability, and rich lignocellulosic composition19. Fruit seeds are notably important as they are produced in substantial amounts as by-products of the food processing industry, making them ideal for producing efficient adsorbing carbons with satisfactory hardness and a well-developed porous structure20. Olive seeds21,22, grape seeds23, peach seeds24, apricot seeds25,26, cherry seeds27, and date seeds28–30have been successfully used as precursors in the preparation of ACs with large surface areas and pore volumes.

Date palm trees are among the most widely cultivated crops in arid regions, valued for their substantial lignocellulosic biomass content31. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is a leading global producer of dates, contributing approximately 17% of the world’s total date production. With an estimated 31 million date palm trees, the country produces over 1.5 million tons of date fruit annually, along with a considerable quantity of agricultural waste. On average, a single date palm tree generates more than 20 kg of lignocellulosic waste biomass per year32. This abundant byproduct represents a promising resource for the production of value-added materials such as activated carbon.

The production of activated carbon (AC) from lignocellulosic biomass is typically a two-step process involving pyrolysis (or carbonization) to create biochar, followed by an activation step to develop its porous structure33. Activation can be physical (using steam or CO₂) or chemical (using agents like ZnCl₂, H₃PO₄, or KOH)34,35. Chemical activation is often preferred as it allows for greater control over the final product’s surface area, pore structure, and surface chemistry. It is also more energy-efficient and typically results in a higher carbon yield, enhancing the process’s sustainability and cost-effectiveness36,37.

Among chemical activators, potassium hydroxide (KOH) has been consistently shown to be superior for producing high-performance carbons from date seeds. For instance, comparative studies have demonstrated that KOH activation yields significantly higher surface areas and more developed pore structures compared to activation with ZnCl₂ or H₃PO₄38,39. Similar results have also been reported in the literature using other precursors40–42. This enhanced porosity makes KOH-activated carbons particularly effective for adsorbing a wide range of pollutants.

Furthermore, the synthesis methodology plays a critical role in determining the performance of activated carbon (AC). For instance, a two-step process—involving pyrolysis followed by separate KOH activation—has consistently been shown to outperform single-step approaches, yielding activated carbon with significantly higher surface area43. Building on this, various studies have optimized the two-step KOH activation of date seeds by systematically varying parameters such as activation temperature, impregnation ratio, and treatment time. These investigations have successfully produced ACs with high surface areas (e.g., 763–910 m²/g) and demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for a variety of pollutants44,45, confirming that both the choice of activating agent and the processing conditions are critical for tailoring adsorbent properties.

Recently, Alsulaili et al.46screened nine different date seed varieties and identified Khalas seeds as the most effective precursor. KOH-activated carbon derived from Khalas exhibited the highest methylene blue adsorption capacity among the tested types. Importantly, the same activated carbon also demonstrated an oil adsorption capacity of 191 mg/g from synthetic produced water. While this was lower than the performance of commercial activated carbon (622 mg/g), the use of agricultural waste as a precursor highlights the economic and environmental viability of this approach for oily wastewater remediation. These findings provide a useful benchmark for evaluating the performance of optimized date-seed-derived carbons in oil adsorption applications.

Given the abundance of date seed waste in Saudi Arabia and its high carbon content, this feedstock represents a significant, yet underutilized, resource for producing low-cost adsorbents. The present study builds upon this premise by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the synthesis of activated carbon from date palm seeds for the removal of crude oil from aqueous media. A novel contribution of this work lies in the systematic optimization of key synthesis parameters—including pyrolysis temperature, KOH impregnation ratio, and activation conditions—to tailor the physicochemical properties of AC for enhanced oil adsorption. A central objective is to move beyond conventional metrics by critically evaluating whether maximizing BET surface area necessarily correlates with improved adsorption capacity for complex pollutants such as crude oil. To achieve this, the performance of the optimized AC was assessed, and its adsorption behavior was analyzed using established isotherm and kinetic models. Through equilibrium and kinetic modeling, along with extensive characterization, this study establishes a clear link between the adsorbent’s physicochemical properties and its crude oil uptake efficacy, providing valuable insights for the development of effective, waste-derived adsorbents for environmental remediation.

Date palm seeds of the Khalas variety were obtained from a date processing facility in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for use in the preparation of activated carbon. The seeds were thoroughly washed with tap water to remove dirt and surface impurities, then dried in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h. After drying, the seeds were ground into a fine powder, which was subsequently washed with n-hexane to extract residual oil. The powder was dried again at 110 °C in a drying oven. Following this, the material was sieved, and the particle size fraction ranging from 212 to 250 μm was selected as the precursor for activated carbon synthesis.

Potassium hydroxide (KOH) with a purity of 85% was used as the chemical activating agent. For adsorption studies, light crude oil with a density of 0.9 g/mL served as the adsorbate. A homogeneous solution was prepared using Triton X-100, a nonionic surfactant with the general formula (C14H22O(C2H4O)n), commonly used in adsorption studies to create stable and reproducible oil-in-water emulsions.

Figure1illustrates the procedure for preparing activated carbon. Initially, biochar was produced by subjecting 5 g of sieved date seed precursor to pyrolysis in a tube furnace (OTF1200X-S, MTI Corporation, USA). Pyrolysis was conducted at two temperatures—400 °C and 500 °C—for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere (99.99% purity) at a flow rate of 150 cm³/min. For the pyrolysis step, a controlled heating rate of 10 °C/min was employed. This rate is characteristic of slow pyrolysis, a process intentionally chosen to maximize the conversion of the biomass into a solid, carbon-rich biochar. This methodology is well-supported by the literature, where a 10 °C/min heating rate is a common and effective parameter for preparing biochar from various agricultural wastes for activation43,47–49. An additional biochar sample was prepared at 400 °C for 1.5 h. The resulting biochar yield and their corresponding BET surface areas are summarized in Table1. The highest BET surface area (10.25 m²/g) was achieved from the sample pyrolyzed at 500 °C for 2 h. As evident from the table, increasing the pyrolysis temperature led to a reduction in biochar yield. In contrast, the yield remained relatively insensitive to variations in heating duration.

The biochar sample exhibiting the highest BET surface area was selected for chemical activation. It was impregnated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution at varying KOH-to-biochar weight ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 (g/g), and stirred for 6 h to ensure uniform mixing. The impregnated samples were then dried in an oven at 110 °C and subsequently activated in a horizontal tube furnace at 700 °C for 2 h under a continuous flow of high-purity nitrogen gas. Post-activation, the samples were leached using 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to remove residual KOH, followed by repeated washing with distilled water until the filtrate reached a neutral pH range of 6.5–7.0.

Among the tested impregnation ratios, the 4:1 (KOH: biochar) ratio yielded the highest BET surface area and carbon yield. To further investigate the effect of activation time and temperature, the 4:1 sample was subjected to additional activations using the same procedure at 700 °C for 1 and 3 h, as well as at 500 °C for 1, 2, and 3 h.

The adsorptive performance of activated carbon samples, prepared by chemical activation with potassium hydroxide (KOH) at various impregnation ratios (2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 g/g), was evaluated for crude oil removal using batch adsorption experiments. Based on these tests, the activated carbon exhibiting the highest adsorption capacity was selected as the optimal sample. This optimal activated carbon was then employed to investigate the effects of key operational parameters—including adsorbent dosage, initial crude oil concentration, and contact time—on the adsorption process.

A stock solution containing 1000 mg/L of crude oil was initially prepared using distilled water. To ensure homogeneous dispersion of the crude oil, Triton X-100 (C₁₄H₂₂O(C₂H₄O)n), a nonionic surfactant, was added to the mixture. The resulting oily wastewater emulsion was stirred continuously for 1 h to achieve uniform distribution of the crude oil droplets.

Batch adsorption experiments were carried out with a contact time of 1 h. A volume of 40 mL of the crude oil stock solution (1000 mg/L) was transferred into 40 mL Total Organic Carbon (TOC) vials, each containing varying dosages of activated carbon. The mixtures were shaken for 1 h at a temperature of 30 ± 2 °C to ensure thorough interaction between the adsorbent and the emulsified crude oil.

Following adsorption, the mixtures were filtered using a Büchner funnel and flask connected to a vacuum pump to separate the activated carbon. The resulting filtrates were collected for oil concentration analysis. Representative images of the filtered samples are presented in Fig.2. The adsorbent dosage used in the experiments ranged from 0.01 to 0.2 g, while the initial crude oil concentration remained constant at 1000 mg/L.

The concentration of crude oil in the aqueous phase was determined using a Total Organic Carbon (TOC) Analyzer (Model: TOC-L, Shimadzu, Japan), which has a detection range of 4 µg/L to 30,000 mg/L. The instrument was calibrated specifically for crude oil, and concentrations were quantified by correlating absorbance readings with a standard calibration curve.

The adsorption efficiency of the activated carbon for crude oil removal was evaluated under various conditions. In one set of experiments, the initial crude oil concentration was varied from 100 to 1000 mg/L while maintaining a fixed adsorbent dosage of 0.05 g and a contact time of 1 h under batch conditions. In a separate experiment, the contact time was varied from 1 to 15 min, while both the initial crude oil concentration and adsorbent dosage were held constant at 1000 mg/L and 0.1 g, respectively. Figure3displays the filtered samples corresponding to varying initial crude oil concentrations (100–1000 mg/L) at a constant adsorbent dose of 0.05 g. Figure4presents the filtered samples obtained at different contact times (1–15 min), with fixed initial concentration (1000 mg/L) and adsorbent dosage (0.1 g).

To characterize the activated carbon, several analytical techniques were employed. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to determine the specific surface area, while the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was applied to estimate the pore volume and pore size distribution. These analyses were conducted using a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar II PLUS, Model 3020, USA). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to identify the surface functional groups present on the activated carbon. FTIR spectra were recorded for both raw and activated samples using a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 spectrophotometer. Additionally, the surface morphology of the adsorbent was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Morphological analysis was carried out on samples before and after activation using a SEM instrument (Model JSM-6360 A, JEOL Ltd., Japan).

The coefficient of determination is a widely used statistical metric for evaluating the goodness-of-fit of adsorption isotherm models. It quantifies the proportion of variance in the experimental data that is explained by the model. A higher value indicates a better fit between the model predictions and the observed data56.

The adsorption kinetics provides insight how adsorbate is transferred from the fluid phase to the surface of a solid adsorbent and subsequently adheres to it. It involves identifying the controlling mechanisms and factors that influence the rate of adsorption, as well as evaluating how the process evolves over time. Among the various kinetic models proposed, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are most commonly employed to describe adsorption behavior.

A review of research published over the past two decades suggests that the pseudo-second-order model often provides a superior fit to experimental data, as it can effectively represent a broad spectrum of adsorption systems, including those involving chemisorption and multilayer interactions57. In contrast, the pseudo-first-order model may fail to adequately describe adsorption behavior, particularly at high initial solute concentrations or when the adsorbent exhibits low adsorption capacity58. Given the relatively high initial crude oil concentration used in this study (1000 mg/L), the adsorption kinetics were analyzed using the Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which is considered more appropriate under such conditions.

Therefore, a linear plot ofversuswill yield a slope ofand a y-intercept of.

The initial step in preparing the adsorbent involved synthesizing biochar from date seeds via pyrolysis. The selection of pyrolysis conditions was guided by established literature, which typically reports temperatures between 300 and 700 °C and durations of 1–3 h to ensure complete carbonization while balancing yield and energy efficiency42,44,60. Accordingly, we chose representative temperatures of 400 °C and 500 °C and durations of 1.5 and 2 h to conduct preliminary experiments aimed at producing a suitable precursor for chemical activation.

The residence times of 1.5 and 2 h were selected as they lie well within the typical range of 1–3 h commonly reported in the literature for ensuring complete carbonization of biomass precursors44,61,62. These durations offer an effective compromise between promoting sufficient thermal decomposition and maximizing carbon yield, while avoiding excessive energy consumption associated with prolonged treatment. For instance, Hameed et al.44also used a 2-h carbonization period for date seeds, whereas other studies have reported successful carbonization at 1 h 161and 1.5 h38, supporting the suitability of the durations used in this study.

As detailed in Table1, these conditions confirmed a clear trade-off between biochar yield and initial surface area development. Pyrolysis at a higher temperature (500 °C) produced a lower yield (27.50%) but resulted in a more developed pore structure, evidenced by a greater BET surface area (10.25 m²/g). In contrast, pyrolysis at 400 °C yielded more biochar (up to 34.18%) but with a substantially less developed surface.

Based on these results, the biochar prepared at 500 °C for 2 h was selected as the optimal precursor for subsequent activation, as its higher initial surface area provided a better foundation for enhancement. It is important to note that this surface area of 10.25 m²/g, while low for an activated carbon, is entirely consistent for a non-activated biochar. For comparison, Bouchelta et al.63reported a surface area of only 4.8 m²/g for date stone biochar carbonized at a high temperature of 800 °C, while Kalderis et al.64found a value of 13.6 m²/g for rice husk biochar prepared at 400 °C. Our choice of a 500 °C pyrolysis temperature is also in agreement with other studies that have used this condition to prepare biochar for high-surface-area activated carbons61,62,65.

This selected biochar was then chemically activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to significantly increase its porosity and adsorption capacity. Table2presents the results of these activation experiments, which were conducted at 700 °C for 2 h using varying KOH-to-biochar impregnation ratios (from 0.5:1 to 5:1).

Yield and BET surface area of activated carbon at different impregnation ratio.

The results demonstrate a clear trend: as the KOH impregnation ratio increases, the BET surface area increases significantly—from 529.16 m²/g at a 0.5:1 ratio to 2417.54 m²/g at a 5:1 ratio—indicating enhanced pore development due to more aggressive activation. However, this comes at the expense of yield, which decreases from 21.31% (AC1) to 13.75% (AC6). This inverse relationship suggests that higher KOH ratios promote gasification and carbon burn-off, reducing yield but increasing porosity. The 4:1 ratio (AC5) offers a favorable balance, achieving a high surface area (2151.31 m²/g) and a moderate yield (15.43%), with a productivity index (Yield × BET) of 331.95 m²/g of biochar.

To further optimize the activation process, the 4:1 KOH impregnation ratio was held constant while activation temperature and time were varied. Table3summarizes the effect of these parameters on BET surface area and yield. The data in Table3reveal that higher activation temperatures (700 °C) produce significantly higher BET surface areas compared to lower temperatures (500 °C), confirming that elevated temperatures enhance pore formation. At 700 °C, variations in heating time (1–3 h) have a marginal impact on surface area, although extended heating slightly reduces yield due to additional carbon loss. The surface area declines modestly from 2151.31 m²/g (AC5, 2 h) to 2072.98 m²/g (AC8, 1 h) and 2128.99 m²/g (AC7, 3 h), while yield decreases more noticeably from 15.43 to 14.27%. These findings suggest that activation at 700 °C for 2 h offers the best compromise between surface area and material recovery.

BET surface area and yield of activated carbon produced at different activation conditions.

Table4compares the surface area, pore volume, and pore size of biochar and activated carbon samples. The data indicate a drastic transformation from macroporous biochar (pore size ~ 50 nm) to microporous and mesoporous activated carbons with much higher surface areas and smaller pore sizes (~ 2–4 nm). These results confirm that increasing the KOH ratio and activation temperature enhances both surface area and pore volume, while reducing pore size. The AC6 sample, produced at a 5:1 KOH ratio, exhibits the highest BET surface area and pore volume, although with the lowest yield.

FTIR spectroscopy was employed to identify the surface functional groups present in the precursor material and the activated carbon. Figure5shows the FTIR spectrum of the raw precursor (date palm seed). A broad, intense band observed at 3422 cm⁻¹ is attributed to O–H stretching vibrations, characteristic of hydroxyl groups in alcohols and phenols, and indicative of moisture and lignocellulosic components. Peaks at 2924 cm⁻¹ and 2855 cm⁻¹ correspond to C–H stretching vibrations of aliphatic –CH₂ and –CH₃ groups, commonly found in alkanes. A sharp peak at 1653 cm⁻¹ is assigned to C = O stretching, suggesting the presence of ketones or conjugated carbonyl compounds. Peaks at 1436 cm⁻¹ and 1375 cm⁻¹ are associated with C–C stretching in aromatic rings, while the band at 1036 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C–H bending in alkanes or vibrations of alkyl halides. Additional peaks at 870 cm⁻¹ and 806 cm⁻¹ suggest C–O bonding in alcohols, carboxylic acids, or esters66. Collectively, these bands reflect the presence of various functional groups typical of lignocellulosic biomass composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.

After KOH activation, the FTIR spectrum of sample AC5 (Fig.6) exhibits distinct changes. The broad O–H band remains at 3420 cm⁻¹, indicating the persistence of hydroxyl-containing groups. Peaks at 2924 cm⁻¹ and 2855 cm⁻¹ are still observed and correspond to C–H stretching vibrations in alkanes66. New bands at 2375 cm⁻¹ and 2310 cm⁻¹ are attributed to C ≡ N stretching vibrations, potentially arising from nitrile groups or physically adsorbed CO₂.

The peak at 1705 cm⁻¹ is associated with C = O stretching in carbonyl-containing groups such as ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids67. A distinct band at 1569 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of C = C stretching within aromatic rings. The band at 1033 cm⁻¹ is assigned to C–O stretching vibrations typical of alcohols and carboxylic acids68. Additionally, a band at 750 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C–H out-of-plane bending, while a low-intensity peak at 475 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C–X stretching, characteristic of alkyl halides67.

The three SEM images illustrate the morphological evolution of date seeds through different processing stages. In Fig. ‎7a, the raw date seeds display a dense, uneven, and rough surface with no visible pores, indicative of their natural, untreated structure. After carbonization, as shown in Fig.7b, some pores begin to emerge as the cell structure partially decomposes, creating initial pathways that modestly increase the surface area. Finally, Fig.7c depicts the effect of potassium hydroxide activation, resulting in a well-defined porous structure with a more uniform surface. This activation process significantly enhances pore formation and surface uniformity, creating an interconnected network of pores that improves the material’s adsorptive capacity, making it more suitable for applications requiring high surface area and porosity.

The surface of the KOH-activated carbon reveals a well-developed porous network with numerous cavities. These are formed during activation as the impregnated KOH etches the carbon framework, leaving behind an interconnected system of voids upon its removal during the washing stage. These cavities form channels that facilitate the movement of adsorbate molecules through the interconnected micro- and mesopores within the carbon structure, enhancing the material’s ability to capture and hold adsorbed substances effectively66.

Four chemically activated carbon samples with varying BET surface areas—AC3 (1328.61 m²/g), AC4 (1772.70 m²/g), AC5 (2151.31 m²/g), and AC6 (2417.54 m²/g)—were evaluated for their crude oil adsorption performance. The quantity of crude oil adsorbed onto the activated carbon at equilibrium,(mg/g), and the percentage removal efficiency were calculated using Eqs. (2) and (3). The adsorption performance at an initial oil concentration of 1000 mg/L, 1-h contact time, temperature of (30 ± 2 °C), and dosages ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 g (in 40 mL solution) are illustrated in Figs.8,9,10and11for AC3, AC4, AC5, and AC6, respectively.

Effect of different AC6 dosages on crude oil adsorption and removal efficiency.

Two opposing trends were observed in these figures. The removal efficiency (right-hand axis) increases sharply with dosage before approaching an asymptotic value. The rise in removal efficiency occurs because a greater mass of adsorbent introduces more total active sites into the solution, allowing for the capture of more oil molecules. The curve flattens as the system approaches its maximum achievable removal, at which point the concentration of remaining oil becomes the limiting factor, and adding more adsorbent yields only marginal gains.

In contrast, the adsorption capacity,(left-hand axis), which measures the mass of oil adsorbed per gram of carbon, is highest at the lowest dosages and decreases as more adsorbent is added. This is because at low dosages, the abundance of oil molecules relative to the available active sites ensures that the adsorbent surface is used very efficiently. As the dosage increases, the number of active sites begins to far exceed the number of oil molecules, leading to a larger fraction of unsaturated sites. This inefficient utilization of the surface area causes the efficiency per unit mass () to drop. The curve becomes asymptotic as the system reaches a state where the ratio of adsorbate to adsorbent sites stabilizes. These trends have also been reported in earlier studies69, further validating the observed adsorption behavior.

Among the tested adsorbents, AC5 consistently exhibited the best overall performance, demonstrating a superior balance of high adsorption capacity and high removal efficiency across the entire dosage range. The overall performance of the activated carbons followed the order: AC5 > AC3 > AC6 > AC4.

A key finding of this study is that the highest BET surface area did not correspond to the best adsorption performance for crude oil. Although AC6 possessed the largest surface area (2417 m²/g), it was significantly outperformed by AC5 (2151 m²/g), which exhibited the highest adsorption capacity (1816 mg/g). This result strongly suggests that for a complex mixture like crude oil, surface chemistry plays a role as critical as, or even more critical than, total surface area.

The superior performance of AC5 can be attributed to its optimized surface functionality, as revealed by the FTIR analysis (Fig.6). The spectrum for AC5 shows a well-defined combination of polar functional groups (such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid groups) and nonpolar moieties (aliphatic and aromatic structures). This chemical heterogeneity likely creates a multifunctional surface uniquely suited for adsorbing the diverse range of compounds found in crude oil through multiple mechanisms, including hydrophobic interactions, π–π stacking with aromatic rings, and polar interactions. In contrast, the more aggressive activation that produced AC6’s higher surface area may have altered these crucial functional groups, potentially leading to a surface less favorable for effective crude oil binding.

AC5 displayed the highest adsorption capacity, reaching 1816 mg/g at 0.01 g, indicating strong affinity and capacity for crude oil adsorption. AC3 followed, with a peak adsorption capacity of 1155.32 mg/g at the same dosage, while AC6 achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 1001.62 mg/g at 0.01 g. In contrast, AC4 demonstrated the lowest maximum adsorption capacity, reaching 859.39 mg/g at 0.01 g. In terms of removal efficiency, AC5 consistently performed well, reaching 80.5% at a dosage of 0.2 g. While AC3 achieved a slightly higher final removal efficiency (87.1% at 0.2 g), its performance is overshadowed by the exceptional adsorption capacity () of AC5. As shown in the figures, AC5’s capacity of 1816 mg/g at low dosages is significantly greater than that of AC3 (1155 mg/g), indicating a much more efficient adsorbent on a per-mass basis. Therefore, considering both its high capacity and high removal efficiency, AC5 was identified as the superior material overall. AC6 reached a removal efficiency of 66.4% at 0.15 g, while AC4 exhibited the lowest removal efficiency, peaking at 63.6% at 0.2 g, making it the least effective adsorbent overall in terms of both adsorption capacity and removal efficiency.

The superior performance of AC5, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 1816 mg/g, is particularly noteworthy when compared to the existing literature. A recent and highly relevant study by Alsulaili et al.46also investigated activated carbon derived from the same Khalas date seed variety for the removal of emulsified oil. Through their optimization process, they reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 191 mg/g. The substantially higher capacity—nearly an order of magnitude greater—achieved in our study highlights the critical impact of our systematic optimization of the KOH impregnation ratio and activation conditions. This comparison confirms that while the choice of precursor is important, the synthesis pathway is paramount in developing a high-performance adsorbent for oil remediation.

The effect of initial crude oil concentration on the adsorption capacity () and removal efficiency of AC5 is shown in Fig.12. Experiments were conducted using 0.05 g of AC5 in a 40 mL solution, with initial crude oil concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg/L at a temperature of (30 ± 2 °C) and a contact time of 1 h. As the initial crude oil concentration increased, the adsorption capacity () of AC5 also increased, reaching a maximum of 502.98 mg/g at a concentration of 1000 mg/L. This trend suggests that higher initial concentrations provide a greater driving force for mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the adsorbent surface, thus enhancing the adsorption process. However, the removal efficiency showed a different pattern. The highest removal efficiency was achieved at the lowest initial concentration of 100 mg/L, with a value of 99.5%. As the initial concentration increased, the removal efficiency decreased, dropping to 63% at 1000 mg/L. This reduction in removal efficiency with increasing initial concentration is likely due to the saturation of available adsorption sites on the AC5 surface, leading to lower percentages of crude oil being adsorbed relative to the total amount present in the solution.

Influence of initial crude oil concentration on the efficacy of AC5 (Adsorbent Dosage = 0.05 g in 40 mL solution).

The adsorption performance of AC5 was studied over varying contact times (1, 2, 4, 8, 15 min) using 0.1 g of AC5 in a 40 mL solution of 1000 mg/L crude oil at a temperature of (30 ± 2 °C). As shown in Fig.13, the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency initially increase with contact time, indicating that more crude oil molecules are being adsorbed onto the active sites of the adsorbent. At 1 min, the adsorption capacity was 265.94 mg/g, with a removal efficiency of 66.5%. This performance improved steadily with time, reachingvalue of 320.70 mg/g at 15 min. The corresponding removal efficiency was 80.2%. The results indicate that the adsorption capacity peaked at 15 min, suggesting that equilibrium was approached, as no significant further improvement was observed beyond this time point.

Figure14shows the experimental data fitted to the Langmuir isotherm, whereis plotted againstas described in Eq. (6). The coefficient of determination () measures the goodness of fit between the observed and predicted values, with an ideal value of 1 indicating a perfect fit. Here, thevalue of 0.934 suggests that the Langmuir model provides a reasonably good representation of the batch equilibrium data. The maximum adsorption capacity () of 416.67 mg/g demonstrates the high efficiency of AC5 in adsorbing crude oil, highlighting its substantial uptake capacity. Thevalue of 0.39 indicates that the adsorption process is favorable, as 0 << 1 values signify favorable adsorption.

Equilibrium isotherm fit of crude oil adsorption onto AC5 using Langmuir isotherm model.

The prediction of the Freundlich isotherm model using experimental data for crude oil removal is depicted in Fig.15, which shows the linear plot ofversus, as detailed in Eq. (9). With anvalue of 0.965, the Freundlich model fits the data better than the Langmuir isotherm (= 0.934). This indicates that the Freundlich model more accurately describes the adsorption process, capturing the surface heterogeneity and multilayer adsorption better than the Langmuir model’s assumption of a uniform surface and monolayer adsorption. Additionally, the value ofwas found to be 2.15. Since this value is greater than 1, it suggests a cooperative adsorption process, where the presence of already adsorbed oil molecules on the surface enhances the adsorption of subsequent molecules. This suggests that as more adsorbate (crude oil) is added, the adsorbent (AC5) has an increased capacity to adsorb, likely due to surface heterogeneity and the potential for multilayer adsorption.

Equilibrium isotherm fit of crude oil adsorption onto AC5 using Freundlich isotherm model.

Figure16presents the comparison between the Temkin isotherm model and the experimental data, whereis plotted vs.as defined in Eq. (11), showing a poor correlation. The low coefficient of determination (= 0.822) suggests that the Temkin model does not accurately capture the adsorption characteristics in this study, indicating that the assumption of a linear change in adsorption energy with surface coverage is not appropriate for describing this adsorption behavior.

Equilibrium isotherm fit of crude oil adsorption onto AC5 using Temkin isotherm model.

Figure17presents a direct comparison between the experimental adsorption data and three isotherm models: Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin. The abscissa represents the equilibrium crude oil concentration in the aqueous phase (), while the ordinate denotes the corresponding amount adsorbed onto AC5 (). As evident from the plot, the Langmuir isotherm shows poor agreement with the experimental data, especially at higher concentrations, where it significantly overestimates the adsorption capacity. In contrast, the Freundlich model demonstrates a more consistent and accurate fit across the entire concentration range studied, suggesting that adsorption on AC5 occurs on a heterogeneous surface with possible multilayer interactions. The Temkin model captures the trend moderately well but deviates at both low and high concentrations. Therefore, based on the visual and quantitative agreement, the Freundlich isotherm appears to best describe the adsorption behavior of crude oil onto AC5 in this study.

The parameters and correlation coefficients (for all three linearized isotherm models are summarized in Table5. The Freundlich model best fits the experimental results of this study, as indicated by its superiorvalue compared to the other two models. The maximum adsorption capacity () derived from the Langmuir model was calculated to be 416.67 mg/g. It is important to note that this theoretical value is significantly lower than the experimental capacities observed at low dosages (e.g., 1816 mg/g). This discrepancy further confirms that the Langmuir model, which assumes monolayer coverage on a homogeneous surface, is not suitable for describing the complex, multilayer adsorption of crude oil onto the heterogeneous surface of AC5.

Figure18illustrates the experimental data fitted to the pseudo-second-order model, whereis plotted against t as described in Eq. (13). From the plot, the adsorption capacity () and the pseudo-second-order rate constant () were determined from the slope and y-intercept of the plot, respectively. Table6presents the values of,, andfor the linearized pseudo-second-order model for crude oil adsorption onto AC5. The high correlation coefficient (= 0.999) and the calculated adsorption capacity were found to closely match the experimentally determined values.

To contextualize the performance of the activated carbons developed in this study, a comprehensive comparison was made with various adsorbents reported in the literature for crude oil removal. Table7summarizes the maximum adsorption capacities of different materials, including raw biomass, chars, and other activated carbons. The results of this comparison are highly significant. The optimized adsorbent from this study, AC5, demonstrated a maximum adsorption capacity of 1816 mg/g. This value not only surpasses that of other activated carbons derived from agricultural wastes like banana peels (356.2 mg/g) and barley straw (576.0 mg/g) but is also notably higher than that reported for a commercial activated carbon (1667 mg/g).

Comparison of adsorption capacity of different biomass wastes for the removal crude oil from wastewater.

Most importantly, the performance of AC5 represents a substantial improvement over other activated carbons derived from the same date seed precursor. For instance, the previously reported capacity for a date seed AC was 191.00 mg/g46. The nearly an order of magnitude increase in adsorption capacity achieved in our work underscores the critical impact of our systematic optimization of the KOH activation process. While some raw biomass materials like corncob powder show high capacities, their practical application can be limited by low density and lack of structural integrity. Our study successfully produced a robust activated carbon that not only leverages a sustainable waste stream but also exhibits a performance that is competitive with, and even superior to, established commercial adsorbents. This highlights the significant potential of date palm seeds as a feedstock for producing high-performance materials for oil spill remediation.

The sustainability of the developed adsorbent is underscored by its significant potential for scalability and its economic viability, particularly within the agricultural and environmental context of Saudi Arabia. The primary precursor, date seeds, is not a niche material but an abundant agricultural waste, with the Kingdom producing over 1.5 million tons of dates annually. This abundant and consistent supply of feedstock is a critical factor that ensures the scalability of this process from the laboratory to an industrial level.

From an economic perspective, this optimization-driven strategy aligns with a “waste-to-wealth” model, transforming a low-value or even negative-cost material (considering disposal costs) into a high-performance adsorbent. Given the exceptional adsorption capacity achieved in this study—which surpasses that of commercial activated carbon—the developed material presents a promising and cost-effective alternative for industrial applications.

Furthermore, this work offers a compelling circular economy solution tailored to regional challenges. It leverages a prevalent agricultural waste—date seeds from the nation’s vast date farming industry—to address a pressing environmental issue: crude oil contamination from the petroleum industry. This dual-benefit approach not only reduces the burden on landfills but also provides a sustainable, locally sourced solution for oil remediation, aligning perfectly with national sustainability goals.

This study successfully demonstrates a robust pathway for synthesizing high-performance activated carbon from date palm seed waste for the effective removal of crude oil from contaminated water. Through systematic optimization of pyrolysis and KOH activation parameters, a superior adsorbent (AC5) was developed, exhibiting a large surface area (2151 m²/g) and an exceptional crude oil adsorption capacity of 1816 mg/g.

A critical finding of this work is that maximum surface area does not solely dictate adsorption performance for complex pollutants; AC5 significantly outperformed a sample with a higher surface area (AC6), a result attributed to its more favorable surface chemistry and functional groups, as confirmed by FTIR analysis. The adsorption process was best described by the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, indicating multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface.

The performance of the optimized adsorbent surpasses that of many other biomass-derived materials reported in the literature, including commercial activated carbon. Notably, the adsorption capacity represents an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude over previously reported date seed-derived carbons, emphasizing the critical role of synthesis optimization. This work not only highlights the significant potential for valorizing abundant agricultural waste into a cost-effective and sustainable adsorbent but also provides a synthesis pathway for developing adsorbents with exceptionally high efficacy for oil spill remediation.
