The impacts of environmental health risk factors, including temperature, vary across urban and rural areas. Application of different metrics of rurality and urbanicity can yield different risk characterizations. We aimed to identify, describe, and quantify how urban/rural metrics are used in epidemiologic studies of ambient temperature and health across the United States (US).

Using PubMed and Scopus, we identified epidemiologic studies published between January 2010 and March 2025 that examined ambient temperature and health in the US and included a defined, quantitative metric of urbanicity/rurality. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted using a predetermined tool.

Of the 11,013 studies resulting from our search, 36 were included. We identified 23 metrics drawing from 10 data sources. The most frequently used metrics were population density and size from the US Census (n= 11 studies). Other metrics reflected connectivity and proximity to surrounding areas, such as the US Census’s Urban-Rural Classification (n= 7 studies), and the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes (n= 4 studies) and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (n= 2 studies). Additional metrics captured features related to the natural environment, built environment, and employment. Many studies did not provide a rationale for metric selection.

Urbanicity and rurality metrics have moved beyond population size and density to include other features. Providing rationales for choice of metric or the differential vulnerability or adaptive capacity captured by the metric could bolster understanding of urban-rural differences in the impact of temperature on health.

Environmental, social, and health risk factors can vary substantially across the urban-rural continuum [1,2]. Consequently, epidemiologic investigations may assess whether environmental exposure-response relationships differ across urban and rural forms. Such analyses involve the application of metrics to classify the degree of urbanicity and rurality of geographies across the United States (US). Designations such as “urban” and “rural” are proxies for the influence of multiple features of a geography’s socioeconomic and cultural landscapes, as well as its natural and built environments [3–5]. The variety of available metrics and lack of consensus on a standard approach reflects the multidimensional aspects of urbanicity and rurality. While related, different urban-rural metrics are not necessarily correlated [2] and even when they are correlated, they could be capturing different aspects of the urban-rural divide. Therefore, inconsistent usage could yield different interpretations and may lack specificity for underlying factors that may explain how environmental health associations differ across the urban-rural continuum. Further, binary designations of “urban” and “non-urban” areas (suburban and rural areas combined) do not recognize the full spectrum of demographic, cultural, and economic factors within these designations [5–9]. Heterogeneity within urban or rural forms could obscure important adaptive capacities or vulnerabilities [10]. It is important to assess and evaluate the different methods used to define urbanicity and rurality so they can be accurately captured and addressed [11].

Ambient temperature has been linked to a variety of health outcomes, such as hospitalizations, respiratory illnesses, premature mortality, and adverse birth outcomes [12–18]. Most epidemiologic studies of temperature and health focus on urban areas (such as urban heat islands), with rural areas receiving less attention, even though an estimated 20% of the US population and 43% of the global population lives in rural areas [4,19]. Urban and rural areas differ across a range of demographic, economic, and infrastructural characteristics that may shape population vulnerability and adaptability to ambient temperature [4,20,21]. Urban areas are typically characterized by higher population density, more economic diversification, greater access to healthcare and social services, and more built infrastructure, including transportation networks and impervious surfaces, and higher levels of air pollution [22,23]. In contrast, rural areas often have lower population density, older populations, more limited access to healthcare and emergency services, greater reliance on agricultural economies, and more extensive greenspace [24–27]. These differences can affect both exposure (e.g., through land cover and urban heat island effects), health outcomes (e.g., through baseline vulnerability, healthcare access), and adaptation (e.g., access to cooling centers, prevalence of air conditioning) [24–30]. Recognizing this heterogeneity is essential for interpreting geographic variation in temperature-related health effects and for informing equitable public health interventions.

Our scoping review is designed to examine the conceptualization and operationalization of quantitative metrics of urbanicity and rurality within epidemiologic studies of ambient temperature and health in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute methodology [31]. A protocol was uploaded to Open Science Framework [32].

We searched PubMed and Scopus for articles published between January 1, 2010, and March 11, 2025, using a combination of keywords and medical subject heading terms. Full search terms are available in the protocol (TableS1-TableS4). Search terms were organized into three critical components: (1) exposure, (2) urbanicity/rurality, and (3) outcome. The target exposure was related to ambient air temperature, such as average/maximum temperature, temperature variability, heat waves and cold waves (i.e., consecutive days above or below a pre-specified temperature threshold). The specific health outcomes included birth outcomes/defects, cancer, cardiovascular health, general health outcomes related to temperature (e.g., heat stroke, hypothermia), mortality (all-cause and cause-specific), and/or respiratory health. We also included search terms related to urbanicity and rurality. Terms within each category (e.g., exposure) were combined using “or” and the categories were combined using “and”. Gray literature was not included. To achieve a manageable scope and facilitate a more in-depth analysis of urban and rural metrics based on similar data sources, studies were restricted to those with a US population.

Studies resulting from these database searches were uploaded to Covidence, a screening and data extraction tool for conducting systematic reviews, and duplicates were removed [33]. Title and abstract and full-text reviews of included studies were conducted independently by two reviewers from our study team for assessment against inclusion criteria (TableS5). Reasons for exclusion during the full-text review process included: (1) non-English language, (2) non-US study population, (3) not a human observational study, (4) does not use a quantitative metric of urbanicity/rurality, (5) does not include an ambient temperature exposure, (6) does not include a qualifying health outcome, (7) non-relevant, non-primary or non-eligible source (review, meta-analysis, etc.), and (8) relevant, non-primary or non-eligible source (review, meta-analysis, etc.).

Discrepancies concerning inclusion of studies throughout the selection process were resolved by the lead reviewers (NCD and NPJ) through discussion with the two independent reviewers when necessary. Backward and forward citation chaining was conducted with the studies selected for inclusion using citationchaser [34]. Results from this additional search were uploaded to Covidence and underwent the same screening process as the database results (i.e., title and abstract screening, full-text screening by two independent reviewers).

The data from each included study were extracted using a tool we customized in Covidence that included fields capturing methodological details related to study design (e.g., population, location), temperature exposure assessment, health outcome, urbanicity/rurality metric, location, methods, and other key elements relevant to the review questions. In addition, we determined which of six features were captured by each metric, as explicitly described by authors or based on our own assessment (in the absence of an explicit description by authors). The six features included: population, natural environment, built environment, connectivity, proximity, and employment. Population included population density and size, natural environment included features such as greenspace and blue space, built environment included factors such as road density, connectivity captured cross-community social and economic connections, proximity included distance to specific natural or manmade landmark or feature, and employment included percent population employed in select industries. These conceptualizations were informed by our included studies and the general literature [2,5]. Extracted data were summarized and described in tabular and graphic formats.

We identified 11,013 unique studies through our searches of PubMed, Scopus, and citationchaser (Fig.1). Of these, 10,834 were screened out during the title and abstract screening process, resulting in 179 studies that underwent a full-text review. A total of 143 studies were removed during full-text review, with the most common reason for exclusion being the lack of a quantitative metric of urbanicity/rurality (n= 110). We included 36 studies that met our criteria (Fig.1).

Almost half of the included studies focused on geographic regions in the southern US (n= 17) and no studies in the western US (Table1). Studies employed a variety of temperature-related exposure metrics, such as daily maximum air temperature, extreme/oppressive heat (author defined), and heatwave (author defined). All studies evaluated exposures from higher temperatures or heat, with 10 specifically examining health outcomes in relation to heatwaves. A total of 10 studies also evaluated colder temperatures, including 2 studies specifically looking at cold waves. The most common health outcome was mortality (n= 22), followed by emergency department visits and medical services (n= 10), birth outcomes (n= 4), and hospital admissions (n= 2). In terms of comparison groups, most of the included studies reported using an urbanicity/rurality metric to differentiate between rural and urban areas (n= 20); however, other studies differentiated levels of urbanicity within urbanized areas (n= 8) or identified comparison groups defined as metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas (n= 4). Additional details of included studies can be found in TableS6and TableS7.

Most of the 36 studies included a single metric of urbanicity/rurality (n= 29), while seven studies employed more than one metric. Similarly, most studies used single-factor metrics that captured one factor associated with urbanicity/rurality, such as population density or land cover (n= 33). One study [35] used a multi-factor (i.e., composite) metric that combined multiple factors related to urbanicity/rurality. The remaining two studies used metrics that could not be identified as single- or multi-factor (Table1).

Among the 36 included studies, we identified 23 unique metrics, defined as having a specified and distinct data source and calculation (Table2). For example, the same data source (e.g., US Census population data) can be used in multiple ways including calculating population size and population density, each of which we considered distinct metrics. Almost all of the 23 metrics identified relied on government data sources including the US Census (n= 7 metrics) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) (n= 2 metrics). For five metrics, the data source could not be confirmed, so these metrics were not counted among the 23 metrics (Table2).

The 23 metrics we identified in the included studies (n= 36) were often operationalized in different ways. For instance, use of the population density metric as either a continuous or categorical variable or at the census tract or census block group level were considered different applications of the same metric. This yielded what we have defined as 50 applications of these 23 metrics. Among these 50 metric applications, county-level boundary was the most common geographic level of resolution (n= 17 metric applications); 36 metric applications were categorical (Table1). Most metric applications were of existing metrics (n= 30 metric applications); however, some studies constructed new metric applications specific to their research setting and questions (n= 15 metric applications).

Many studies did not explicitly discuss which features of urban and rural settings were captured by the metric(s) used, so we identified the features best captured by each metric, including population, natural environment, built environment, connectivity, proximity, and employment (Table3). Most metrics reflected more than one of these features to measure urbanicity/rurality.

Most (n= 30) of the 36 included studies relied either directly or indirectly on metrics of urbanicity/rurality that account for population size or density. The majority of these studies [8,35–44] calculated population density from US Census population estimates. One study [41] built on this approach by categorizing counties with a US Census estimated population greater than 250,000 and population density of 1,000 people per square mile as part of the urban core. The remaining counties were categorized as non-urban core. Several studies [45–51] used the US Census’s Urban-Rural Classification Scheme, which incorporates census-based population data, in conjunction with other variables on commuting, housing, land use, and population data when designating sub-county census-defined areas into rural and urban areas.

Other studies used metrics created by other organizations and agencies that used US Census population estimates indirectly. The USDA’s Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) and Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes rely in part on US Census population estimates [21,52–54]. One study [55] used the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy’s (FORHP’s) urban/rural designations, which takes US Census population estimates into account.

The US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uses US Census designations in conjunction with additional population estimate requirements when categorizing counties into one of three designations: Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Micropolitan Statistical Area (µSA), and Outside Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) (Fig.2). One study [7] used these designations published by the OMB. Four studies [56–59] used the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) classification scheme, which incorporates additional census-based population estimates in conjunction with OMB designations to assign counties to one of four metropolitan or two nonmetropolitan categories (Fig.2).

The US Census was not the only source of population estimates. Another study [17] calculated the concentration of the population, as estimated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in core areas within larger metropolitan regions and used the OECD’s regional urban/rural typology codes (based in part on population density estimates).

Five studies considered the natural environment in the creation of their urban/rural metric. Seong et al., 2023 [60] used percentage of water area estimated by the US Census and greenspace estimated using the USGS’s normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Sera et al., 2019 [17] calculated green area (land covered by vegetation, forest, and parks) as square meters per million persons, using the USGS’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) dataset. Maier et al., 2014 [61] used the University of Georgia’s Natural Resources Spatial Analysis Laboratory land type/land use classifications to identify nonurban areas. Two additional studies [39,62] used the USGS’s National Land Cover Database. Keeler et al., 2025 [62] calculated percent tree canopy per US Census urban area while Lee and Brown, 2022 [39] calculated percent tree cover, grass area, and water bodies per US Census block group.

More than half (n= 25) of the included studies incorporated elements of the built environment with their choice of urban/rural metric. The most common way studies incorporated the built environment was through the direct or indirect use of the US Census’s urban-rural designations, which account for residential and commercial land use [45–51]. Another twelve studies [7,21,38,44,52–59] used metrics from the OMB, USDA, NCHS, and FORHP which rely on US Census designations.

A wide variety of other sources were used to incorporate the built environment into metrics of urbanicity/rurality. Two studies incorporated continuous road density estimates from the Texas Department of Transportation [60] and US Census [35]. Maier et al., 2014 [61] combined the University of Georgia’s Natural Resources Spatial Analysis Laboratory’s land type/land use classifications of low-intensity urban and high-intensity into one continuous variable representing the percentage of urbanization. All other land types/land uses were categorized as rural. Lee and Brown 2022 [39] used the USGS’s NDVI to calculate the percentage of tree cover, grass area, impervious surface, and water bodies for each block group in their analyses. They also used the USGS’s Normalized Difference Built-Up Index as a continuous measurement of the distribution of urban structures. Sera et al., 2019 [17] used two data elements from the OECD: (1) the sprawl index which measures the growth in built-up areas adjusted for the growth in city populations, and (2) the percentage of urbanized area which measures the share of the urbanized area over the total land of a metropolitan area.

The CBSA designations published by the OMB consider the degree of social and economic connectivity between central and adjacent counties, as measured by commuting patterns. One study [7] used OMB designations directly and four studies [56–59] used NCHS’s Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties, which also rely on OMB designations. Mendrinos et al., 2024 [55] employed the FORHP’s urban/rural designations, which take into account US Census, USDA, and OMB classifications.

The USDA publishes two urban/rural metrics that rely on OMB designations (RUCA and RUCC). RUCA codes assign census tracts to one of 11 primary designations by considering its location in relation to MSAs and µSAs, and commuting flows within and across census-designated urban areas. Four studies [38,44,53,54] used RUCA codes in their analysis. RUCCs assign counties to one of three metro or six non-metro designations based on population estimates and the county’s geographic relation to MSAs and µSAs. Two studies [21,52] employed RUCCs.

One study [35] used US Census data to address connectivity. Yang and Jensen, 2017 [35] calculated the percentage of workers commuting by public transportation, the percentage of workers traveling over an hour to work, and the percentage of workers employed outside their county of residence. Fechter-Leggett et al., 2016 [56] used the NCHS’s Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties, which relies in part on OMB designations.

A total of 20 studies employed an urban/rural metric that captured proximity. The majority of these studies used metrics that group geographies in part based on their proximity to each other including the US Census’s urban/rural designations [45–51], USDA’s RUCA codes [38,44,53,54] and RUCCs [21,52], NCHS’s Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [56–59], and the OMB CBSA designations [7]. Mendrinos et al., 2024 [55] used the FORHP’s urban/rural designations, which take into account US Census, USDA, and OMB classifications.

One study [63] considered proximity by categorizing residential locations less than 30 km from the nearest National Climatic Data Center monitoring station as urban and all other residential locations as rural.

One study [35] used employment estimates in their urbanicity/rurality metric by using US Census estimates of the percentage of the population employed in farming, forestry, and fishing as a proxy of natural resource dependency, a key feature of rurality. This variable was combined with other variables covering different rural features in a composite metric.

In this scoping review, we provide an overview of how quantitative metrics of urbanicity and rurality have been conceptualized and operationalized in environmental epidemiologic research of temperature and health. While traditional population size and density-based metrics were most common, a wide array of metrics were used such as those incorporating population, natural environment, built environment, connectivity, proximity, and employment, which reflect different aspects of urban and rural settings.

Most metrics used in the 36 included studies incorporated data from US government sources, relying to some extent on data collected by the US Census. While the US Census publishes their own urban/rural designations, other agencies use these designations or the variables population size and density in conjunction with additional requirements to calculate their own urbanicity/rurality metrics such as the OMB’s CBSAs and the NCHS’s urban-rural classification scheme for counties.

Different studies in our review employed metrics of urbanicity and rurality that varied in both spatial scale (e.g., census tract, metropolitan statistical area [MSA]) and parameterization (e.g., binary, categorical, continuous). Each metric has distinct advantages and limitations [64]. For example, the USDA’s Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), are widely used due to their accessibility and nationwide coverage. However, the RUCC’s county-level resolution can obscure meaningful intra-county variation, limiting its applicability in health studies that require more geographically granular definitions of rurality.

Included studies used both categorical and continuous metrics. Binary classifications (e.g., urban vs. rural) offer simplicity and ease of interpretation, especially in models requiring clear contrasts, but can obscure important gradations in the urban-rural spectrum. Categorical classifications can enhance interpretability or align with administrative definitions, however, they impart artificial cut-offs on what is an inherently continuous gradient. Moreover, use of a categorical system inherently introduces heterogeneity within each category because no classification system can perfectly capture all relevant features and differences among observations. For example, several studies used metrics based on OMB CBSA designations. The OMB readily recognizes the heterogeneity within these metrics by acknowledging that “the CBSA classification is not an urban-rural classification; MSAs, µSAs, and many counties outside CBSAs contain both urban and rural populations” [65]. A total of 11 studies [7,21,38,44,52–54,56–59] included in this scoping review employed metrics reliant on OMB designations.

Continuous measures can preserve variability and improve statistical power, yet often require assumptions about linearity or distribution that may not be justified. Some metrics of urbanicity and rurality are continuous, such as population density, and may be more appropriately analyzed as continuous variables, if issues of nonlinearity are addressed. One study treated RUCC values as a continuous variable, which preserved the ordinal structure while avoiding the unrealistic assumption of uniform risk within the categories [66]. This approach also enabled more flexible modeling strategies, such as splines or trend analysis.

Creation of composite urban/rural metrics such as indices in which multiple factors (e.g., population density, land use, commuting patterns, resource availability, and natural amenities) are combined reflects multiple features of the urbanicity/rurality of a community, yet they face their own challenges and drawbacks. Some examples of composite metrics include Yang and Jensen, 2017 [35], which applied a factor analysis technique to group six different variables (% employed in farming, forestry fishing; population density; road density; % workers commuting by public transportation; % workers commuting > 1 h; % workers applied outside their county) into three dimensions of natural resources dependency, population concentration, and exogenous economic integration. Another example would be to rank geographies from 0 (most rural) to 100 (most urban) [67]. With this approach, indices can be tailored to specific regions with inputs that are most applicable. The Index of Relative Rurality – a measure of rurality that incorporates dimensions of population, population density, extent of urbanized area, and distance to the nearest metropolitan area – is one such index that was not used in any of the included studies [68]. Development of composite metrics often relies upon multivariate techniques, such as factor analysis or principal component analysis. While factor analysis can be useful for identifying latent constructs, it assumes multivariate normality among input variables, which may not hold for real-world environmental and social variables, even after standard transformations [69]. Principal components analysis is robust to non-normal data and has the ability to reduce dimensionality while retaining the most informative variables. However, it does not account for measurement error and may obscure interpretability if the principal components do not meaningfully align with the underlying features of urbanicity or rurality. Further, composite metrics hinder the ability to disentangle which aspects of urbanicity or rurality are most important for the relationship between environment and health. They also face methodological challenges of identifying the most appropriate way to combine and weight different urbanicity and rurality characteristics, which may differ by environment-health association. Therefore, while composite metrics can provide reflect multiple aspects of urbanicity/rurality, they are also limited and consideration of methodological trade-offs is important when selecting an approach.

Many studies lacked detail on which specific aspects of urban or rural environments were captured by the metrics they used. To address this, we assigned metrics to one or more feature: population, natural environment, built environment, connectivity, proximity, and employment. While we present them as distinct for analytical purposes, they are in some cases conceptually inter-related. For example, the built and natural environments are both components of the physical landscape.

Each of these features may shape the relationship between temperature and health through different ways. For instance, densely populated urban areas may increase social connectedness (e.g., ease of checking on neighbors), but also pose risks due to overcrowding and concentrations of vulnerable groups [70–72]. In contrast, less populated areas often, although not always, have older populations and lower density, which can delay emergency response and reduce access to cooling services [73–76]. Natural environments differ in their capacity to mitigate heat. Some urban areas lack green space and tree canopy, limiting natural cooling, whereas rural settings benefit from more vegetation and open water, although the types and access of green space of urban and rural areas can vary substantially (e.g., urban parks versus agricultural areas) [70,77]. The built environment shapes exposure through infrastructure differences, such as urban heat island effects and unequal access to air conditioning in cities, versus older homes and lower air conditioning prevalence in rural areas [10,78]. Energy poverty can further limit use of cooling, especially in rural regions [10,78]. Connectivity captures differences in transportation and infrastructure, with urban residents typically benefitting from more transportation options and access to resources, while rural residents face longer travel distances and limited infrastructure [74,75]. Relatedly, proximity to services, such as healthcare and climate shelters, is typically higher in urban areas, while rural isolation can delay care during extreme events [74,75]. Lastly, employment patterns affect occupational exposures; rural economies tend to rely more heavily on outdoor, seasonal work, increasing direct exposure to extreme temperatures and reliance on climate-sensitive resources [76,79].

Some included studies used a population-based metric of urbanicity/rurality, such as population size, concentration, or density. Population-based metrics can be useful in categorizing large geographies into distinct rural and urban regions; however, with shifts to urbanization as well as changes in workforce patterns (e.g., work from home and the gig economy), traditional rural-urban metrics may need to adapt to account for the diminished importance of “commuting patterns” as a larger percentage of the workforce shifts to hybrid or remote work [80,81]. Some included studies [17,39,60–62] considered elements of the natural environment pertinent to urban/rural distinctions in their study area. This approach allows researchers to identify the unique environmental features of the geographies in question and determine how they relate to urban/rural categorization for their specific research question.

Many studies examined urban-rural differences as a secondary analysis. However, investigating the impacts of temperature and other environmental and social stressors in rural areas also warrants investigation as a central question. While the world is undergoing rapid, unprecedented urbanization, rural regions are also transitioning, such as shifts in agricultural corporatization and technologies [82]. Residents of US rural areas face social and structural disadvantages, including higher poverty rates and lower healthcare access. The National Institutes of Health has designated underserved rural populations as an environmental disparities population due to the higher health burden from environmental conditions than their urban counterparts, even after adjustment for race/ethnicity and socio-economic status [83]. Furthermore, rural areas are highly understudied in environmental health literature; while about 20% of the US lives in rural regions, rural communities are underrepresented in the environmental health literature. Additional research is needed on the complex pathways through which rural health may be affected by environmental conditions.

Some important limitations of our review should be noted. First, while our analysis focused on the US, in part to maintain a manageable scope, expanding this to obtain a global perspective on urban and rural metrics would provide valuable insights, as the nature of urbanicity and rurality can differ by region. Additionally, no studies were identified from the west coast, which limits regional representation. Finally, despite our best efforts, some relevant studies may have been missed due to the inherent challenges of conducting comprehensive literature searches and it is possible that studies investigating other proxies for urban-rural features (e.g., artificial night lights) were not captured within our search terms. Nonetheless, our findings provide valuable insights into the current state of the literature.
