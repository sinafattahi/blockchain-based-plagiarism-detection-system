Adolescent dating violence victimization is a prevalent public health issue with potential long‐term consequences, yet little is known about its impact on different forms of adult violence. This study investigated the long‐term association between adolescent dating violence victimization and violence involvement in adulthood, differentiating between intimate partner violence (IPV) and non‐intimate partner violence (non‐IPV), as well as victimization and perpetration. It also examined whether these associations vary by gender and race/ethnicity. This study used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) (N= 2164). Sibling fixed effects logistic regression models were employed to control for unobserved family‐level heterogeneity. Interaction terms tested for gender and racial/ethnic differences. Adolescent dating violence victimization was significantly associated with increased odds of non‐IPV perpetration (OR = 2.387, 95% CI [1.183, 4.815]) and IPV victimization (OR = 1.880, 95% CI [1.266, 2.792]) in adulthood. When disaggregating by type, psychological dating violence victimization was linked to higher odds of non‐IPV perpetration and IPV victimization, whereas physical dating violence victimization was more strongly associated with both IPV victimization and perpetration. No significant patterns of gender or racial/ethnic heterogeneity were observed. Findings highlight the developmental continuity of violence and the importance of distinguishing between violence types and roles. Adolescent dating violence victimization, particularly in psychological and physical forms, poses a significant long‐term risk for adult violence involvement. These results underscore the need for early prevention efforts and relationship education that address both victimization and perpetration in diverse contexts.

Adolescent dating violence victimization is a widespread and pressing public health concern, with significant implications for youth development and long‐term well‐being. National estimates indicate that approximately 1 in 3 adolescents in the United States experiences some form of physical, emotional, or psychological violence within a dating relationship (Clayton et al.,2023), and this issue has long been recognized as a matter of national urgency (Leen et al.,2013). A growing body of research has linked adolescent dating violence victimization to a range of immediate negative outcomes which may disrupt physical, emotional, and social development. Victims are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, often rooted in the trauma and diminished self‐worth associated with abusive relationships (Baiden et al.,2021; Van Ouytsel et al.,2017). Exposure to dating violence is also linked to increased substance use, as adolescents may turn to alcohol or drugs to manage emotional distress or relational turmoil (Piolanti & Foran,2022a). Academically, affected youth tend to show reduced school engagement, lower academic performance, and higher rates of absenteeism, reflecting the broader toll of interpersonal violence on their functioning and well‐being (Taquette & Monteiro,2019). Despite substantial evidence on these short‐term effects, less is known about the long‐term consequences of adolescent dating violence victimization, particularly whether such experiences contribute to continued involvement in violence into adulthood.

A growing body of research suggests that adolescent dating violence victimization may serve as a critical precursor to violence experiences in adulthood, reflecting developmental continuity in interpersonal violence. Early exposure to dating violence can shape maladaptive relational patterns, normalize coercive or aggressive behaviors, and impair the development of healthy coping and communication skills (Capaldi et al.,2012; Smith et al.,2003). These patterns may become internalized and later manifest in adult relationships, increasing the likelihood of both revictimization in adult intimate partnerships and perpetration of violence in various social contexts. For instance, individuals who experience psychological or physical aggression in adolescence may carry forward distorted expectations about relationship dynamics, such as associating love with control or conflict, which can contribute to cycles of violence (Exner‐Cortens et al.,2017). Empirical studies have shown that adolescent dating violence victimization is linked not only to poor mental health and substance use in young adulthood but also to elevated risks of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization and perpetration years later (Johnson et al.,2015; Smith et al.,2003).

Despite existing evidence, several areas warrant further attention. First, distinguishing between types of violence outcomes—specifically, intimate partner violence (IPV) versus non‐intimate partner violence (non‐IPV), and victimization versus perpetration—is essential for developing a more nuanced understanding of the long‐term consequences of adolescent dating violence victimization (Kim et al.,2025). IPV occurs within emotionally significant and often interdependent relationships, where dynamics, such as attachment, power, and emotional investment shape both the experience and expression of violence (Capaldi et al.,2012; Exner‐Cortens et al.,2023). In contrast, non‐IPV typically involves acquaintances or strangers and may arise from different social, situational, or behavioral pathways, such as peer influence, impulsivity, or exposure to community violence (Siegel et al.,2019). Likewise, differentiating between victimization and perpetration is important, as these roles may be driven by distinct underlying mechanisms—such as trauma, social learning, or deficits in self‐regulation (Cui et al.,2013; Park & Kim,2019). Treating all violence outcomes as a single, homogenous category risks obscuring meaningful variation in how adolescent dating violence victimization influences individuals over time.

Second, understanding of how the long‐term consequences of adolescent dating violence victimization may differ by gender and race/ethnicity remains limited. Much of the existing literature has focused primarily on overall prevalence and short‐term outcomes, often treating gender and racial/ethnic differences as secondary considerations or relying on subgroup analyses without sufficient statistical power (Hamby & Turner,2013; Vagi et al.,2013). Some studies suggest that females are more likely to experience psychological and physical victimization, while males may be more likely to perpetrate violence; but findings are often inconsistent and may overlook important contextual or intersectional factors (Foshee et al.,2010; Spencer et al.,2016; Storer et al.,2021).

Meanwhile, racial and ethnic minority youth—such as Black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents—have been consistently found to exhibit heightened vulnerability both to repeated exposure to victimization and to the victim‐to‐perpetrator cycle (Kaukinen et al.,2015; Lo et al.,2020). They are more likely to encounter structural disadvantages that limit access to protective resources in the context of victimization, including legal safeguards, mental healthcare, and social support systems (Joo et al.,2024; Park & Kim,2025; Weiss et al.,2017). Furthermore, environmental conditions such as relatively elevated rates of community violence, childhood maltreatment, and peer bullying may further compound their violence‐related experiences (McNulty & Bellair,2003; Rojas‐Gaona et al.,2016; Spriggs et al.,2007). As a result, compared with White adolescents, dating violence victimization may be more readily internalized among youth of color, thereby increasing their subsequent risk of violence involvement. Despite this growing recognition of racial/ethnic diversity and structural inequalities in violence‐related experiences in the U.S., few studies have examined how these broader conditions may interact with early dating violence victimization to shape adult outcomes (Barhight et al.,2017; Campo‐Tena, Larmour, Pereda, & Eisner,2024).

Third, many studies examining the link between adolescent dating violence victimization and later outcomes rely on conventional regression models that adjust only for observable covariates. However, accounting for unobserved family heterogeneity is essential for accurately assessing the long‐term consequences of adolescent dating violence victimization—yet, this critical source of bias has been largely overlooked in prior research (Fergusson et al.,2005; Moffitt,2005). Conventional models often fail to account for unmeasured family‐level factors such as parenting practices, family conflict, exposure to violence in the home, or inherited behavioral tendencies, all of which may influence both the likelihood of experiencing dating violence victimization in adolescence and the risk of violence involvement in adulthood (Ackard & Eisenberg,2024; Calvete et al.,2018). Ignoring these shared influences can lead to biased or overstated associations (Park et al.,2023), thereby conflating the true effects of adolescent dating violence victimization with broader familial or environmental risks.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this study investigates the long‐term consequences of adolescent dating violence victimization by examining its association with multiple forms of violence involvement in adulthood. Specifically, this study distinguishes between IPV and non‐IPV, as well as between victimization and perpetration. This study primarily aims to assess the independent influence of adolescent dating violence victimization on adult violence outcomes across different contexts and roles. To address potential bias from unobserved family‐level confounders, we employ a sibling fixed effect model which leverages within‐family variation. This approach may offer a more rigorous estimation compared with alternative methods that rely on between‐family variation, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or mixed‐effects models. In addition, interaction models assess whether these associations vary by gender or race/ethnicity. By addressing key methodological limitations and disaggregating violence outcomes, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental continuity of violence and offers valuable insights for designing prevention and intervention strategies tailored to diverse populations and relationship dynamics.

This study draws on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative, school‐based study designed to investigate the health‐related trajectories of U.S. adolescents into adulthood. The baseline survey (Wave I) was conducted during the 1994–1995 academic year, targeting students enrolled in grades 7 through 12 (ages 12–21). Participants were subsequently followed over multiple waves: Wave II in 1996 (age 13–22), Wave III in 2001–2002 (ages 18–26), Wave IV in 2008–2009 (ages 24–32), and Wave V in 2016–2018 (ages 33–43). These follow‐up waves capture developmental stages from adolescence into early adulthood, young adulthood, and full adulthood. Add Health is widely regarded for its methodological rigor and high retention rates, which range from 77.4% to 88.6% across waves (Harris et al.,2019). The dataset offers rich longitudinal data on social, behavioral, and relational domains, including detailed information on family structure, peer dynamics, educational and occupational transitions, and romantic and sexual partnerships. This makes Add Health uniquely suited for investigating long‐term associations between adolescent dating violence and subsequent involvement in interpersonal or non‐intimate violence, whether as a victim or perpetrator.

A distinguishing feature of Add Health is its oversampling of sibling pairs, enabling more robust controls for familial and genetic confounding. The present study focuses on a sibling subsample comprising 3666 individuals who were followed through Wave IV. From this group, we excluded 1502 respondents who had not reported any romantic relationships by Wave II, as our primary interest is in the longitudinal consequences of early dating experiences. The final analytic sample included 2164 individuals. To address missing data on key covariates—most notably, cognitive ability scores missing for 94 respondents—we employed multiple imputation using chained equations (MICE) in Stata version 18.5. Ten imputed datasets were generated, and all analytic models included imputed values to improve statistical precision and reduce bias (White et al.,2011). All participants (or their next of kin/caregiver) provided written informed consent in accordance with Add Health study protocols. As this research involves secondary analysis of de‐identified, publicly available data, it was exempt from full review by an institutional review board.

The primary outcome variable in this study, measured at Wave IV, is adult violence involvement, distinguished along two key dimensions: (1) the type of violence—IPV versus non‐IPV, and (2) the role—victimization versus perpetration.

IPV experiences were assessed during Wave IV for participants who reported being in a romantic relationship at the time. IPV victimization was measured using four items that asked how often, in the past 12 months, a partner had: (1) slapped, hit, or kicked the respondent; (2) threatened violence, pushed or shoved them, or thrown something potentially harmful; (3) forced or insisted on sexual relations against their will; and (4) caused physical injuries, such as sprains, bruises, or cuts due to a physical altercation. Response options ranged from 0 (never) to 7 (more than 20 times). For analytical purposes, responses from 1 to 7 were recoded as 1, indicating any occurrence of IPV victimization, while a response of 0 was coded as 0, reflecting no victimization. This resulted in a binary indicator capturing the presence or absence of IPV victimization in the past year. IPV perpetration was assessed using the same four behavioral items, rephrased to reflect the respondent's own actions toward their partner. Responses were coded in the same binary fashion to indicate whether the respondent had perpetrated any form of IPV in the preceding 12 months.

In addition to IPV, non‐IPV experiences were also captured in Wave IV, focusing on incidents that typically occur outside intimate relationships—often involving strangers, acquaintances, or occurring in public settings. Non‐IPV victimization was assessed by asking respondents whether, in the past year, they had been the target of violence, including having a weapon (knife or gun) pulled on them, being shot or stabbed, slapped, hit, choked, kicked, or beaten up. A binary variable was created, with 1 indicating any experience of such events and 0 indicating none. Non‐IPV perpetration was measured using items that asked whether the respondent had, in the past 12 months, engaged in violent acts such as pulling a weapon on someone, stabbing or shooting someone, taking part in a group fight, or getting into a serious physical fight. As with other outcomes, a binary variable was created to capture any instance of non‐IPV perpetration during the reference period.

All violence outcome variables were dichotomized to indicate the presence or absence of each type of violence involvement (victimization or perpetration, IPV or non‐IPV). This decision was guided by several methodological and substantive considerations. First, this approach aligns with standard practice in the violence literature, where binary indicators (e.g., any victimization vs. none) are commonly used to facilitate comparability across studies and to reflect the public health significance of experiencing any violence. Second, dichotomization facilitated the use of logistic regression models, which estimate the relative odds of violence involvement while controlling for unobserved family‐level confounders through sibling fixed effects.

During Wave II, participants were asked to report up to three current or past romantic relationships. A relationship was considered romantic if it included affectionate behaviors—such as holding hands, kissing, or saying “I love you”—and was characterized by labels like “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.” For each reported relationship, participants indicated whether they had experienced any of five specific partner behaviors (coded 0 = “no,” 1 = “yes”): “publicly insulted you,” “swore at you,” “threatened you with physical violence,” “pushed or shoved you,” or “had something thrown at you.” The first three behaviors were drawn from the psychological aggression subscale of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2), while the last two were adapted from the physical assault subscale (Straus et al.,1996). A binary indicator for psychological dating violence victimization was created by coding respondents as 1 if they reported experiencing at least one of the three psychological aggression items. Similarly, physical dating violence victimization was coded as 1 if at least one of the two physical assault items was endorsed. An overall measure of adolescent dating violence victimization was constructed and coded as 1 if the participant reported experiencing any of the five listed behaviors in any of their reported relationships.

Although Wave II includes respondents aged 13–22, about 92% of the analytic sample were younger than 20, corresponding to adolescence in standard developmental frameworks. The small proportion of participants aged 20 or older can be considered late adolescents or emerging adults. Given this age distribution, we consider it appropriate to characterize the exposure as adolescent dating violence victimization.

Recognizing that demographic factors are well‐documented predictors of violence exposure (Napier et al.,2023), this study adjusted for a range of individual‐level covariates assessed at Wave I. These included participants’ age, gender, race/ethnicity (categorized as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Other), foreign‐born status, first‐born status, and cognitive ability, as measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PVT). To facilitate interpretation, PVT scores were standardized by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation. These background characteristics are known to influence adolescents’ vulnerability to violence and may also shape patterns of violence involvement later in life (Campo‐Tena, Larmour, Ribeaud, & Eisner,2024; Maas et al.,2010; Pereda et al.,2022). Moreover, we included the number of dating relationships as a covariate. This variable accounts for differences in opportunity for dating violence exposure, given prior evidence that having multiple relationships increases the likelihood of experiencing dating violence (Halpern et al.,2009). Including these covariates in the models helps reduce potential confounding and enhances the precision of estimates regarding the long‐term association between adolescent dating violence and adult violence outcomes.

The termμfcaptures sibling fixed effects, thereby accounting for shared influences such as genetic predispositions, household socioeconomic status, parental mental health, family relationships, and exposure to early life adversity. Conceptually, the sibling fixed effects approach is equivalent to estimating within‐family differences, isolating the impact of dating violence victimization on later outcomes while holding constant all shared background factors. To address potential clustering of residuals within families, robust standard errors (εif) were clustered at the family level. Accordingly, we conducted four main sibling fixed effects logistic regression models, each corresponding to each of the adult violence outcomes: non‐IPV victimization, non‐IPV perpetration, IPV victimization, and IPV perpetration.

We also conducted post hoc sensitivity analyses using G*Power (version 3.1) to estimate the minimum detectable odds ratios at 80% power andα= .05, given our sample size (N= 2164), exposure prevalence (31%), and the prevalence of each outcome. These analyses indicated that the study was powered to detect odds ratios of approximately 1.42 or greater for non‐IPV victimization, 1.54 for non‐IPV perpetration, 1.33 for IPV victimization, and 1.38 for IPV perpetration.

To further explore potential heterogeneity in the relationship between adolescent dating violence and adult violence outcomes, we estimated interaction models that incorporate interaction terms between adolescent dating violence victimization (ADVif) and key demographic variables—specifically, gender and race/ethnicity—into the baseline sibling fixed effects model (Equation1). These models allow us to assess whether the association between adolescent dating violence and later violence involvement differs systematically across subgroups. The conceptual framework of our analytic model is presented in Figure1.

Table1presented the descriptive statistics for the analytic sibling sample used in this study (N= 2164). The dependent variables, measured at Wave IV, captured four types of violence experiences in adulthood. Approximately, 14% of respondents reported experiencing non‐IPV victimization, while 8% reported engaging in non‐IPV perpetration. In contrast, rates of IPV were higher: 26% experienced IPV victimization, and 18% reported perpetrating IPV. The key independent variable—adolescent dating violence, measured at Wave II—was reported by 31% of respondents. When disaggregated by type, 29% experienced psychological dating violence, and 11% experienced physical dating violence. Individual‐level covariates measured at Wave I include demographic and background characteristics. The average age of respondents was 16.32 years (SD = 1.66), and 45% were male. The sample was racially/ethnically diverse, with 59% identifying as White, 22% as Black, 14% as Hispanic, 4% as Asian, and 1% as another racial/ethnic group. Additionally, 6% of the sample were foreign‐born, and 40% were first‐born children. Respondents reported an average of 1.34 dating relationships at Wave II (SD = 0.61).

Table2displayed the results from sibling fixed effects logistic regression models assessing the association between adolescent dating violence victimization and adult violence outcomes. Focusing first on non‐IPV outcomes, the association with non‐IPV victimization was not statistically significant (Column 1). In contrast, as shown in Column 2, adolescent dating violence victimization was significantly associated with non‐IPV perpetration in adulthood (OR = 2.210, 95% CI [1.074, 4.548],p< .05) (Column 2), indicating that individuals exposed to dating violence victimization in adolescence were more than twice as likely to engage in violent acts outside of intimate relationships compared with their siblings who did not report such experiences. Turning to IPV outcomes, Column 3 indicated that adolescent dating violence victimization was significantly associated with increased odds of IPV victimization in adulthood (OR = 1.807, 95% CI [1.208, 2.702],p< .01), suggesting that early exposure to dating violence may have long‐term implications for vulnerability to harm within romantic relationships. In Column 4, the association with IPV perpetration, while also positive, was not statistically significant.

Note: Odds ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals in brackets. Individual‐level covariates include age, gender, race/ethnicity, foreign‐born status, first‐born child, standardized PVT score, and number of dating relationships. In sibling fixed effects models, robust standard errors are clustered at the family level.

Our power analyses indicated that the study was sufficiently powered to detect the significant associations we observed for non‐IPV perpetration and IPV victimization, supporting the robustness of these findings. For non‐IPV victimization and IPV perpetration, observed ORs were near the minimum detectable levels, but confidence intervals included the null, reflecting limited precision and possibly borderline power for these associations. Moreover, as a robustness check, we re‐estimated the models using continuous measures of the violence outcomes (i.e., the total number of violence items endorsed). The results were substantively consistent with those from the main analyses using dichotomous outcomes, reinforcing the conclusion that adolescent dating violence victimization is associated with greater involvement in violence in adulthood. These results are presented in TableS1in the online supplementary file.

Table3presented results for heterogeneity in the association between adolescent dating violence victimization and adult violence outcomes by gender (Panel A) and race/ethnicity (Panel B). In Panel A, the interaction terms with gender across all violence outcomes were not statistically significant across any outcomes, suggesting that the associations between adolescent dating violence victimization and adult violence involvement did not differ meaningfully between males and females. Panel B explored racial and ethnic differences. Most interaction terms between adolescent dating violence victimization and racial/ethnic groups were not statistically significant, indicating relatively consistent effects across racial/ethnic subgroups. However, a notable exception was the significant interaction for “Others” (i.e., racial/ethnic groups not classified as White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian) in the IPV perpetration model (OR = 3.276, 95% CI [1.134, 9.460],p< .05), suggesting a stronger association between adolescent dating violence victimization and adult IPV perpetration for respondents in this category. However, this finding should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size within that subgroup.

Individual‐level covariates include age, gender, race/ethnicity, foreign‐born status, first‐born child, standardized PVT score, and number of dating relationships. In sibling fixed effects models, robust standard errors are clustered at the family level.

Table4reported the associations between different types of adolescent dating violence victimization —psychological and physical—and violence involvement in adulthood. Psychological dating violence was significantly associated with non‐IPV perpetration (OR = 2.095, 95% CI [1.042, 4.660],p< .05; Column 2) and IPV victimization (OR = 1.543, 95% CI [1.018, 2.462],p< .05; Column 3). These findings suggested that adolescents who had experienced psychological aggression in romantic relationships were over twice as likely to perpetrate non‐IPV and about 50% more likely to be victimized by an intimate partner in adulthood, compared with their siblings who did not report such experiences. In contrast, physical dating violence showed associations with IPV outcomes, but not with non‐IPV outcomes. As shown in Columns 3 and 4, physical dating violence was a significant risk factor for both IPV victimization (OR = 1.930, 95% CI [1.005, 3.704],p< .05) and IPV perpetration (OR = 2.263, 95% CI [1.058, 4.842],p< .05), indicating that adolescents exposed to physical aggression in romantic relationships were nearly twice as likely to be victimized and more than twice as likely to perpetrate IPV in adulthood.

Note: Odds ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals in brackets. Individual‐level covariates include age, gender, race/ethnicity, foreign‐born status, first‐born child, standardized PVT score, and number of dating relationships. In sibling fixed effects models, robust standard errors are clustered at the family level.

The present study provides robust evidence of a significant association between adolescent dating violence victimization and increased risk of violence involvement in adulthood, even after accounting for unobserved family‐level confounders through sibling fixed effects models. Specifically, individuals who experienced dating violence during adolescence were more likely to perpetrate non‐IPV and experience victimization in intimate relationships later in life. These findings align with and extend prior research suggesting that early exposure to relationship violence can disrupt normative developmental trajectories and contribute to the persistence of aggressive or victimization patterns across the life course (Park et al.,2018). Adolescence is a critical developmental window during which individuals form foundational interpersonal skills, emotional regulation capacities, and internal models of romantic relationships (Calvete et al.,2018; Lundgren & Amin,2015). Exposure to violence during this stage can distort perceptions of healthy relationship norms, normalize coercive or abusive behaviors, and impair the ability to navigate conflict constructively (Capaldi et al.,2012; Jang et al.,2024). Prior research has shown that these early disruptions are associated with long‐term consequences such as increased emotional dysregulation, hostile attribution biases, and the adoption of maladaptive coping mechanisms, all of which elevate the risk of future violence involvement—both as victim and perpetrator (Sumner et al.,2015).

An especially noteworthy pattern emerging from the analysis is that individuals who experienced dating violence during adolescence are more likely to experience victimization in intimate partner contexts (i.e., within the home); yet are more likely to perpetrate violence in non‐intimate settings (i.e., outside the home). This divergence in role and context suggests that adolescent dating violence victimization may shape not only the risk of future violence but also the relational dynamics and situational contexts in which that violence occurs. One possible interpretation is that early exposure to violence in romantic relationships contributes to the internalization of submissive or helpless roles in close, emotionally charged relationships, making individuals more vulnerable to revictimization in later intimate partnerships (Manchikanti Gómez,2011). Conversely, the same individuals may externalize their distress or model learned aggressive behaviors in less emotionally intimate or more confrontational settings, leading to aggression or dominance‐seeking behavior in public or peer‐related environments (Capaldi et al.,2012; Esquivel‐Santoveña et al.,2021). This dual outcome underscores the complex and context‐dependent effects of adolescent dating violence victimization. Victimization in early relationships may undermine the development of healthy interpersonal boundaries and coping skills, contributing to a cycle of victimization in emotionally significant relationships (Moon et al.,2022). At the same time, these early experiences may cultivate generalized aggression, mistrust, or hypervigilance that manifests outwardly in social contexts perceived as threatening or competitive.

The present study found no consistent empirical evidence of gender‐ or racial/ethnic‐based heterogeneity in the association between adolescent dating violence victimization and adult violence outcomes. Although prior research has suggested that the consequences of violence may vary by gender, with women more likely to experience victimization and men more likely to perpetrate violence (Hamby & Turner,2013; Malhi et al.,2020)—the interaction models in this analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in effects between males and females. Similarly, despite well‐documented racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to community violence and structural disadvantage (Joo et al.,2024; Rojas‐Gaona et al.,2016), the associations between adolescent dating violence victimization and later violence outcomes did not significantly differ across major racial/ethnic groups. Overall, nonsignificant interaction effects suggest that the long‐term impact of adolescent dating violence victimization on adult violence involvement may operate similarly across gender and racial/ethnic lines, highlighting the pervasive and broadly distributed nature of its consequences.

Another interesting finding from this study is the distinctive role of physical dating violence in increasing the risk of later violence outcomes. Specifically, physical dating violence victimization in adolescence was significantly associated with both IPV victimization and perpetration in adulthood, but showed no significant relationship with either non‐IPV victimization or perpetration. This pattern suggests that physical aggression experienced within early romantic relationships may have a relationship‐specific impact, shaping how individuals engage in or respond to conflict within future intimate partnerships. The absence of an association with non‐IPV outcomes implies that the effects of physical dating violence victimization are not necessarily generalized to broader social interactions but are more likely to manifest within the emotionally intimate and often high‐stakes context of adult romantic relationships. This may be because physical dating violence victimization during adolescence disrupts normative expectations of safety, communication, and boundaries in intimate settings, potentially fostering cycles of both victimization and aggression that are contextually bound to romantic or domestic dynamics (Stith et al.,2004).

This study makes several important theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature on the long‐term violence outcomes of adolescent dating violence victimization. Theoretically, the findings support developmental and life course perspectives that emphasize how early interpersonal experiences—particularly those involving violence—can shape later behavioral patterns and relational dynamics (Littman & Paluck,2015). By demonstrating that adolescent dating violence victimization is associated with both victimization and perpetration in adulthood, particularly in intimate contexts, the study reinforces models of behavioral continuity and cumulative disadvantage, suggesting that early adverse experiences cascade into long‐term relational and psychosocial risks (Littman & Paluck,2015). Additionally, by disaggregating violence outcomes into IPV and non‐IPV, as well as victimization and perpetration, the study provides a more nuanced understanding of how adolescent experiences may influence distinct forms and roles in adult violence. Methodologically, the study advances the field by employing sibling fixed effects logistic regression models, a rigorous design that controls for all shared family‐level confounders—such as overall parenting practices, household environment, and common genetic predispositions—that could bias associations in conventional observational studies.

Despite its strengths, this study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, although the sibling fixed effects approach controls for all unobserved confounders shared between siblings, it does not account for individual‐specific unobserved factors, such as personality traits, peer influences, or unmeasured life events, which may also affect both adolescent dating violence victimization and adult outcomes. Second, the reliance on self‐reported data may introduce social desirability bias, particularly regarding sensitive topics like IPV or perpetration. Such tendencies may contribute in part to the relatively low prevalence of adult violence involvement observed in our analytic sample. This limitation should be considered when interpreting our findings, as low outcome prevalence may reduce the statistical power of our models and lead to underestimation of associations.

Third, the analytic sample was restricted to sibling pairs in which at least one respondent reported having been in a romantic relationship by Wave II. As such, the generalizability of the findings may be limited with respect to only children or adolescents who initiated romantic relationships after Wave II. Given potential variation in both the risks and consequences of dating experiences based on family structure and the developmental timing of relationship initiation (Spencer et al.,2020), future research would benefit from examining whether the observed associations hold across adolescents with different sibling compositions and romantic relationship trajectories. Finally, the measures of dating violence victimization, although based on validated scales, may not capture the full range of experiences—such as coercive control, stalking, or digital abuse—that are increasingly recognized as components of dating violence. In particular, given the growing role of social media and online communication in shaping interpersonal dynamics during adolescence (Rodríguez‐deArriba et al.,2021; Thulin et al.,2022), the absence of data on digital interaction may limit the extent to which this study reflects the contexts in which dating violence occurs. Future research that incorporates digital dimensions of dating violence victimization may provide more comprehensive insights into its long‐term implications for violence involvement.

The findings of this study carry important policy implications. The demonstrated long‐term association between adolescent dating violence victimization and adult violence outcomes underscores the need for both universal prevention programs and early targeted interventions for dating violence victims. In particular, school‐based interventions that promote healthy relationship skills, emotional regulation, and nonviolent conflict resolution among adolescents may be effective not only in reducing the risk of dating violence itself, but also in interrupting its entrenchment into adult involvement in violence (Finnie et al.,2022; Flores Morales et al.,2022; Jang & Kim,2023; Lee & Wong,2022). In parallel, social norms and institutional infrastructures must be strengthened to support the early identification of dating violence and to ensure timely responses across family, school, and community systems. These may include confidential reporting systems, coordinated mental health services, and community outreach efforts aimed at engaging at‐risk youth (Doucette et al.,2021; Moore et al.,2015; Sharkey et al.,2017).

Additionally, given that both psychological and physical forms of dating violence are associated with long‐term harm, policies and interventions should not focus exclusively on physical aggression. While substantial progress has been made in developing and evaluating programs targeting physical dating violence, effective interventions that address psychological dimensions—such as emotional and verbal abuse—remain comparatively underdeveloped (Arrojo et al.,2024; Piolanti & Foran,2022b). Based on the recognition of the enduring consequences of non‐physical forms of dating violence, the targeted strategies that respond to their unique dynamics and impact should be developed. Finally, the distinct pattern wherein adolescent dating violence victimization is linked to IPV victimization and non‐IPV perpetration in adulthood underscores the need for integrated prevention models that address both victim support and the development of prosocial behavior across relational contexts (Jang et al.,2024; Song & Kim,2024). Investing in comprehensive adolescent relationship education and support services may yield long‐term public health benefits by reducing cycles of violence and promoting safer, healthier adult relationships.
