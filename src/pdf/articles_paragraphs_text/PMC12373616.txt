Cancer immunotherapy has transformed oncology, with CAR-T cell therapy emerging as a cornerstone of personalized treatment for hematologic malignancies. In China, rapid advancements in domestically developed CAR-T therapies have achieved clinical outcomes comparable to global benchmarks, with overall response rates (ORR) of 79–89% in B-cell malignancies and 64% 12-month progression-free survival in multiple myeloma. Despite these successes, CAR-T application in solid tumors remains hindered by antigen heterogeneity, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. To address these barriers, China has pioneered innovative strategies, including dual-target CAR-T constructs, armored CAR-Ts secreting immunomodulatory cytokines, and synergistic integration with traditional Chinese medicine, which enhances CAR-T efficacy by inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells and reducing cytokine release syndrome. Notably, preclinical studies demonstrate that Huangqin increases tumor regression rates from 40 to 65% in lung cancer models when combined with CAR-T therapy. Concurrently, China is reshaping accessibility through policy innovations such as the “1 + 3 + N” multi-tiered payment system and regional insurance pilots, which reduce patient costs by 50%. Strategic investments in automated manufacturing and global regulatory harmonization further position China as a leader in cost-effective CAR-T development. However, challenges persist in solid tumor targeting, international market integration, and long-term safety monitoring. Future directions emphasize precision engineering, AI-driven treatment optimization, and cross-border collaborations to advance next-generation therapies. By balancing innovation, affordability, and policy agility, China is poised to drive the global evolution of cancer immunotherapy while addressing unmet needs in both hematologic and solid malignancies.

Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology by reprogramming the immune system to target malignancies, with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy emerging as a transformative approach for hematologic cancers. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have expanded therapeutic options, CAR-T therapy stands at the forefront of personalized immunotherapy due to its ability to engineer patient-derived T cells for precise tumor targeting and eradication [1–3]. Since the 2017 FDA approval of CD19-targeted CAR-T therapies, this approach has achieved unprecedented success in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies, with complete remission rates exceeding 50% in global trials [4,5]. In China, the development of CAR-T therapy has accelerated rapidly, with four domestically developed products, such as Arelcabtagene autoleucel and Equecabtagene autoleucel, approved for lymphoma and myeloma since 2021. These therapies have demonstrated comparable efficacy to their Western counterparts while addressing unique regional challenges, including cost and manufacturing scalability [6,7]. Despite these advances, CAR-T therapy faces limitations in treating solid tumors due to antigen heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments—challenges that are also shared, to varying degrees, by ICIs and BsAbs [8,9]. ICIs, exemplified by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, have shown durable responses in select solid tumors but are hindered by primary resistance [10]. Similarly, BsAbs, such as Emicizumab and Epcoritamab, bridge immune and tumor cells but are limited by cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and antigen diversity [11,12]. In contrast, CAR-T research in China has prioritized overcoming these barriers through innovative strategies such as dual-target CAR-Ts (e.g., CD19/BCMA), armored CAR-Ts that secrete immunostimulatory cytokines, and integration with traditional Chinese medicine to modulate the tumor microenvironment [13–16]. This review focuses on CAR-T therapy as the central pillar of China’s advancements in immunotherapy, contextualizing its progress relative to global benchmarks. It also briefly discusses the complementary roles of ICIs and BsAbs. By analyzing clinical outcomes, regulatory frameworks, and cost-optimization strategies unique to China, we aim to highlight the growing influence of Chinese research in shaping the future of cancer immunotherapy.

CAR-T cell therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking advancement in the treatment of hematologic cancers, leveraging the ability of engineered T cells to specifically target tumor antigens such as CD19 and BCMA[17,18]. The clinical success of CAR-T therapies, including Arelcabtagene autoleucel and Equecabtagene autoleucel in China, underscores the transformative potential of personalized immunotherapy in cancer treatment. These therapies have demonstrated remarkable clinical outcomes, with ORR of 79–89% for CD19-targeted CAR-T in B-ALL from Chinese Phase II single-arm trials (e.g., Arelcabtagene autoleucel, NCT03563810) [21–23] and 89.6% ORR for BCMA CAR-T (Equecabtagene autoleucel) in multiple myeloma from the FUMANBA-1 trial (NCT03784192), a single-arm nonrandomized study [20]. The 64% 12-month PFS in multiple myeloma surpasses historical chemotherapy outcomes and is derived from the same Chinese trial [20]. Recently, there has been growing interest in the potential synergy between CAR-T therapy and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis), in modulating the tumor microenvironment and enhancing treatment efficacy. As noted, active components of Huangqin, such as baicalin and baicalein, have shown significant promise in reducing the immunosuppressive effects within the tumor microenvironment. This is primarily attributed to their ability to inhibit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and reduce the levels of suppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, which typically attenuate immune responses [24–27]. Additionally, Huangqin promotes the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which enhance T cell activation and prevent T cell exhaustion, a critical challenge in optimizing CAR-T therapy efficacy [28].

The application of CAR-T therapy to solid tumors is hindered by three interconnected challenges related to tumor biology and the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). First, antigen heterogeneity presents a significant obstacle, as solid tumors do not exhibit the uniform expression of lineage-specific antigens seen in hematologic malignancies. For example, glypican-3 (GPC3), a frequently targeted antigen in Chinese clinical trials for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is expressed in only 40–60% of HCC patients in China, resulting in incomplete tumor cell eradication and eventual relapse [37]. Similarly, Claudin18.2, a promising gastric cancer target in China, demonstrates variable expression across different tumor subtypes, complicating patient selection [38]. Second, the immunosuppressive TME in solid tumors severely impairs CAR-T cell efficacy. Elevated levels of TGF-β and IL-10 in solid tumors from Chinese patients have been shown to suppress CAR-T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity by upregulating exhaustion markers such as TIM-3 and LAG-3 [39]. A study further revealed that gastric cancer stromal cells reduced CAR-T cytotoxicity by 70% through dual PD-L1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated immunosuppression, underscoring the critical role of the TME in resistance to therapy [40]. Third, on-target/off-tumor toxicity remains a major safety concern. Targeting antigens like Claudin18.2, which is expressed in 60% of Chinese gastric cancers as well as in normal gastric mucosa, has led to severe adverse effects [41]. In a Phase I, single-center, open-label trial (N= 36) of Claudin18.2-targeted CAR-T therapy (CT041) in advanced gastric cancer, 28% (10/36) of patients developed grade ≥ 3 gastritis due to off-tumor toxicity toward healthy gastric mucosa [42]. This highlights the delicate balance between efficacy and safety in solid tumor CAR-T applications, where antigen expression on normal tissues remains a critical challenge. These challenges collectively underscore the need for innovative strategies to enhance antigen specificity, modulate the TME, and mitigate off-tumor effects in CAR-T therapies for solid tumors.

In recent years, the rapid development of CAR-T therapy in China has prompted the government to explore pilot programs and multi-tiered payment models to alleviate the financial burden on patients [46]. One notable initiative is the “Hu Hui Bao” program, launched in 2023 in Shanghai. This program offers up to 50% reimbursement for eligible CAR-T treatments, significantly reducing out-of-pocket expenses for patients. For instance, a patient undergoing CAR-T therapy with Yescarta®(priced at 1.2 million RMB) could receive a 500,000 RMB payout from Hu Hui Bao, reducing their out-of-pocket drug cost by 41.7% (from 1.2 million to 700,000 RMB) [47]. As of March 2024, the program has reimbursed over 33 million RMB for CAR-T treatments, benefiting nearly 60 patients in Shanghai [48]. Notably, this coverage applies solely to CAR-T drug costs and does not include hospitalization, nursing, or other treatment-related expenses. Actual out-of-pocket costs may still exceed 60% of total treatment fees, depending on additional medical needs [48]. Initial reports indicate that the program is available at key medical institutions in both urban and suburban areas of Shanghai. During its implementation, the program has adhered to principles of fairness, ensuring that all eligible patients have access. Moreover, it has emphasized the collection of real-time data and performance evaluations. Early feedback suggests that “Hu Hui Bao” has substantially reduced patient costs, enhanced treatment coverage, and increased patient satisfaction. Despite these promising results in Shanghai, the program has not yet been expanded nationwide. To further internationalize CAR-T therapy, China is actively seeking collaboration with global markets by attracting international investment, enhancing cross-border regulatory coordination, and adopting international standards [49]. These efforts aim not only to reduce treatment costs but also to create favorable conditions for Chinese CAR-T products to enter the global market, thereby establishing a complementary and mutually beneficial development model both domestically and internationally [50].

Looking ahead, the field of cancer immunotherapy is poised for significant breakthroughs in precision medicine, cell engineering, and combination therapies. Advanced techniques such as single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics are expected to refine patient stratification, as demonstrated by emerging trials identifying predictive biomarkers for CAR-T efficacy in solid tumors [51]. Additionally, “armored” CAR-T cells, engineered to secrete IL-12 or resist TGF-β signaling, are showing promising results in early-phase clinical trials, improving persistence and efficacy within immunosuppressive microenvironments [52]. In the field of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), research is expanding beyond dual immune checkpoint blockade to incorporate novel antigen pairs, addressing both tumor heterogeneity and immune suppression [53]. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is transforming telemedicine platforms, enabling real-time monitoring and dynamic adjustment of immunotherapy regimens based on predictive analytics [54]. Meanwhile, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) continue to advance, with next-generation targets such as LAG-3 and TIM-3 aimed at overcoming resistance and expanding their applicability to a broader range of solid tumors [55]. Despite these advances, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) remain substantial obstacles [56]. Future strategies will focus on multi-omics integration and personalized treatment protocols, leveraging predictive biomarkers to enhance efficacy while minimizing toxicity. These efforts are expected to propel cancer immunotherapy toward greater maturity and broader global adoption.

Table2compares the CAR-T development strategies, highlighting key differences between China and Western countries. In Western countries, CAR-T development predominantly focuses on specific cancer types and highly personalized treatment protocols, relying on well-established technological platforms [57]. In contrast, China places a strong emphasis on cost-effectiveness in CAR-T research, while accelerating clinical trial progress, supported by robust policy backing and advantageous market access [58]. Additionally, Western countries tend to impose more stringent drug regulations and data accumulation standards, whereas China benefits from more flexible approval processes and faster market promotion [59,60]. Based on the comparative analysis in Table1, this paper suggests three key strategies for China to enhance the accessibility and international competitiveness of its CAR-T therapies by drawing from the experiences of Western countries. First, China could expand insurance pilot programs, inspired by the Shanghai “Hu Hui Bao” initiative, which provided 50% reimbursement for CAR-T treatments in 2023. Extending similar pilot programs to high-demand regions such as Beijing and Guangdong, along with adopting an outcome-based payment model, could link reimbursement rates to CAR-T efficacy, thus alleviating financial pressures on national insurance funds. Second, China could accelerate conditional approvals by implementing real-world data (RWE) requirements, following the FDA’s Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) and Breakthrough Therapy (BPR) pathways. This approach would broaden the scope of conditional approvals and ensure long-term safety and efficacy monitoring while expediting CAR-T market entry. Finally, China should promote automated CAR-T manufacturing for scaled production. Western CAR-T manufacturers, such as Novartis, have implemented fully automated cell processing systems (e.g., the Prodigy system) to reduce costs and shorten production cycles. China should invest in similar automation technologies and optimize local supply chains to further reduce CAR-T treatment costs and enhance affordability.

In conclusion, tumor immunotherapy has fundamentally transformed cancer treatment worldwide, with CAR-T cell therapy emerging as a cornerstone, particularly for hematologic malignancies. China’s rapid advancements in domestically developed CAR-T therapies have positioned it as a front-runner in the global landscape, marked by three key quantified milestones: clinical efficacy with overall response rates (ORRs) of 79–89% in B-cell malignancies and 64% 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) in multiple myeloma, comparable to international benchmarks; cost reduction through regional insurance pilots like “Hu Hui Bao,” which slashed patient out-of-pocket expenses by 41.7% and reimbursed over 33 million RMB for CAR-T treatments as of March 2024; and enhanced patient accessibility, with the multi-tiered payment system extending coverage to over 60 patients in Shanghai while ensuring equity across urban and suburban medical institutions. Despite these achievements, challenges remain in internationalizing CAR-T products, including gaining global regulatory recognition, harmonizing production standards, and addressing market competition. Future strategies should focus on optimizing policies, advancing automated manufacturing, fostering cross-border collaborations, and integrating innovations like traditional Chinese medicine—efforts essential for ensuring Chinese CAR-T therapies continue to benefit domestic patients and achieve broader global adoption.
