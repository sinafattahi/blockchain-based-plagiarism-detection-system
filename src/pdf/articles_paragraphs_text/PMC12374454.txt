Percutaneous external suturing has been proposed as an alternative approach to fascial flap fixation during anterior subcutaneous transposition for cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS), with the aim of minimizing deep tissue disruption and reducing postoperative complications. This study compared short-term outcomes between percutaneous external fixation and traditional subcutaneous fixation of fascial flaps in CuTS surgery.

In this retrospective cohort study, 114 patients who underwent anterior ulnar nerve transposition with fascial flap coverage were enrolled between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were grouped based on the method of fascial flap fixation: subcutaneous (n= 57) or percutaneous (n= 57). Clinical assessments—including Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Patient-Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation (PRUNE), and Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Functional Score—along with nerve conduction studies (CMAP, SNCV, MNCV), were performed preoperatively and at 6-month follow-up.

Compared to the subcutaneous group, the percutaneous group showed significantly greater improvement in VAS scores (VAS: -2.75 vs. -1.99,p< 0.001), PRUNE scores (PRUNE: -23.78 vs. -17.64,p< 0.001), and functional scores (Score: +3.58 vs. + 2.70,p= 0.0004). Increases in SNCV (16.45 m/s vs. 14.51 m/s,p= 0.035) and MNCV (18.55 m/s vs. 12.13 m/s,p< 0.001) were also more pronounced in the percutaneous group. Although CMAP improved in both groups, postoperative CMAP values were slightly higher in the subcutaneous group (6.02 ± 0.85 mV vs. 5.40 ± 0.51 mV,p= 0.002). No infections or wound complications occurred in either group; two reoperations for recurrent compression were required in the subcutaneous group.

Percutaneous external suturing may represent a safe and promising alternative for fascial flap fixation during CuTS surgery, with potential benefits in early postoperative pain relief, nerve conduction, and functional outcomes. However, longer-term studies are needed to assess durability and potential late complications.

This study was retrospectively registered with the Institutional Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (Approval No. PJ2024-12-17).

Cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS) is a common peripheral nerve compression disorder of the upper limb, caused by ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow [1].It is the second most prevalent condition of its kind, following carpal tunnel syndrome, with an estimated annual incidence of 24.7 cases per 100,000 individuals [2]. Typical symptoms include numbness, hand weakness, and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles. In advanced cases, these symptoms may progress to claw hand deformity, leading to substantial impairment in daily activities and occupational function [3–5]. When conservative treatments such as splinting or physical therapy fail to relieve symptoms, surgical intervention becomes the standard course of action.

Several surgical techniques have been developed for CuTS, including simple decompression, ulnar nerve transposition, and endoscopic approaches. Among these, ulnar nerve transposition often incorporates fascial flap coverage to protect the nerve and reduce mechanical irritation [6]. Traditionally, these fascial flaps are fixed to the subcutaneous tissue using absorbable sutures to maintain nerve positioning and reduce direct pressure [7,8].However, this approach has been associated with several complications, including excessive scar tissue formation, limited nerve gliding, and increased susceptibility to infection [9]. These issues may impair postoperative nerve recovery and prolong patient discomfort.

To overcome these limitations, we implemented a modified technique involving percutaneous external suturing of the fascial flap [10,11]. Compared with conventional subcutaneous suturing, this technique involves a smaller incision and minimizes deep tissue disruption, potentially reducing the risk of fibrosis, infection, and suture-induced tissue laxity [12,13]. Additionally, external fixation may enhance flap stability and maintain nerve alignment more effectively following surgery.

This study aimed to prospectively compare the clinical efficacy of percutaneous external suturing versus traditional subcutaneous suturing in CuTS surgery. Key outcome measures included complication rates, nerve function recovery, and patient-reported satisfaction. We hypothesized that percutaneous external suturing would result in fewer postoperative complications and improved functional outcomes. Findings from this study may provide new clinical evidence to enhance CuTS surgical techniques and improve recovery in affected patients.

This retrospective cohort study included CuTS patients treated surgically between January 2021 and December 2023 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. All surgical procedures were performed by the same senior orthopedic surgeon.During the study period, this surgeon gradually transitioned from subcutaneous to percutaneous fascial flap fixation. Based on surgery timing, patients were assigned to the control group (n= 55), which received traditional subcutaneous suturing, or the experimental group (n= 59), which received percutaneous external suturing(Table1). Clinical data were extracted from institutional records. Only patients with complete 6-month follow-up and standardized procedures were included; cases with incomplete data or protocol deviations were excluded. All patients underwent uniform preoperative and 6-month postoperative assessments. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Approval No. PJ2024-12-17), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Inclusion criteria: (1) clinically confirmed diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome, meeting surgical criteria and indications for surgery; (2) symptom duration of ≥ 3 months with no improvement following conservative treatment; (3) age between 18 and 75 years; (4) first diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome with no history of ulnar nerve-related surgeries; (5) complete clinical data, good compliance, and no loss to follow-up during the study period. Exclusion criteria: (1) poor elbow condition; (2) clear contraindications to surgery or percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy; (3) pregnant or lactating women; (4) inability to complete follow-up evaluations; (5) systemic neurological disorders or nerve-related conditions associated with comorbidities, such as cervical radiculopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, Guyon’s canal syndrome, ipsilateral median nerve disorders, or other peripheral neuropathies.In patients with bilateral CuTS, only the initially operated limb was included in the analysis to avoid data duplication [14–16].

All patients were screened according to these criteria prior to inclusion, and any cases with confounding factors, incomplete data, or poor compliance were excluded from the final dataset to ensure consistency and reliability in outcome measurement.

The patient was placed in the supine position with the affected limb abducted to approximately 90° and externally rotated on a specialized surgical table. Following successful induction of general anesthesia or brachial plexus block, the anesthesia protocol was standardized and uniformly performed by the same anesthesiology team according to institutional guidelines. Routine aseptic skin preparation and sterile draping were carried out. A pneumatic tourniquet was applied proximally to the upper arm to maintain a bloodless operative field.

A curvilinear incision approximately 10–12 cm in length was made posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus, extending proximally and distally to fully expose the ulnar nerve along its course. Subcutaneous tissue was dissected sharply in layers, with careful protection of superficial sensory nerves, especially the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve. After incising the deep fascia, Osborne’s ligament was identified and released longitudinally from its proximal attachment at the medial epicondyle to its distal insertion at the olecranon, thereby achieving full decompression of the ulnar nerve (Fig.1a).

Microsurgical techniques were used to meticulously dissect the ulnar nerve throughout its path, releasing all fibrous bands, fascial structures, and intermuscular septa. Particular care was taken to preserve epineural vessels and avoid traction injury to the nerve. Upon completion of decompression, the nerve was gently transposed anteriorly to lie anterior to the medial epicondyle in a smooth curve, avoiding acute angles or undue tension (Fig.1b).

A fascial flap measuring approximately 3 × 3 cm was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissue proximal and anterior to the cubital tunnel. The flap was prepared carefully to preserve its vascular supply, avoiding excessive thinning to maintain its structural stability and prevent ischemic contracture .

In the control group, the fascial flap was positioned over the transposed nerve and fixed to the subcutaneous tissue with interrupted 4 − 0 absorbable sutures. Proper tension and positioning were confirmed to ensure stable coverage without compression or displacement of the nerve (Fig.1c).

In the experimental group, the flap was similarly positioned but fixed externally using percutaneous sutures. At the two free corners of the flap, 3 − 0 nylon sutures were inserted percutaneously through the skin, passed through the flap, and exited through the skin again. Suture tension was adjusted to secure the flap externally over the nerve, ensuring no compression occurred (Fig.1d).

Prior to wound closure, passive flexion and extension of the elbow were performed to confirm that the ulnar nerve glided freely without signs of subluxation, compression, or kinking. After confirming adequate nerve positioning, the surgical field was irrigated thoroughly with sterile saline, and a drainage strip was placed to prevent hematoma formation.

The wound was closed in layers: subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted 4 − 0 absorbable sutures, and the skin was closed with either interrupted 4 − 0 absorbable sutures or staples. Postoperatively, the elbow was immobilized at approximately 60° of flexion with a posterior plaster splint to maintain joint positioning during early recovery.

All procedures followed a standardized operative protocol established by the research team and were performed by the same senior hand surgeon to minimize inter-operator variability.

All patients followed a standardized postoperative protocol. The operated limb was immobilized in 60° elbow flexion for two weeks to protect the transposed nerve. Dressing changes were performed every 2–3 days. Subcuticular sutures (control group) did not require removal, whereas percutaneous nylon sutures (experimental group) were removed on days 12–1417,18. After suture removal, all patients began gentle elbow mobilization exercises. Follow-ups occurred monthly for three months, then every three months thereafter, conducted by clinicians not involved in surgery. Preoperative and 6-month postoperative evaluations included clinical exams, symptom scoring, and electrodiagnostic tests. Data were recorded in the hospital’s electronic system and extracted by independent researchers. Only patients with complete 6-month follow-up were included; those with missing clinical or EMG data were excluded to ensure analytical validity [19].

Clinical outcomes were evaluated based on a combination of subjective symptom assessments, functional scoring systems, and objective electrophysiological measurements. All outcomes were assessed at two time points: preoperatively and six months postoperatively.

Pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with patients rating their average pain level over the past week on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Functional disability and patient-reported symptom burden were assessed using the Patient-Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation (PRUNE), a validated questionnaire that evaluates numbness, tingling, grip weakness, fine motor difficulty, and activity interference. Higher PRUNE scores indicate greater disability.

Objective functional recovery was assessed using the Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Functional Scores, which incorporates subjective symptom resolution, muscle strength, and return to function. Higher scores reflect better recovery. Sensory function was evaluated using the static two-point discrimination (2PD) test in the ulnar nerve distribution of the hand, with smaller values indicating improved discriminatory sensation.

Electrophysiological recovery was assessed through nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG). Key parameters included compound muscle action potential (CMAP), sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the ulnar nerve. All electrophysiological tests were performed by trained technicians using standardized protocols and calibrated equipment under the supervision of a neurophysiologist [20,21].

All clinical assessments were performed by evaluators blinded to the surgical fixation method to reduce assessment bias. Although this was a retrospective study, electrophysiological evaluations were conducted by technicians independent of the surgical team, and the fixation method was not disclosed during data acquisition. The use of multiple domains—including pain, function, sensation, and electrophysiology—allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of both subjective and objective recovery following surgery.

All postoperative adverse events within six months were systematically recorded and defined as any complication potentially related to the procedure, wound healing, or fixation method (e.g., infection, hematoma, delayed healing, neuralgia, scar-related recurrence, or reoperation). Patients underwent routine clinical evaluations, including incision inspection, neurologic assessment, and symptom review. Unscheduled visits were also captured. Events were documented in the hospital’s electronic system and verified by independent staff. Reoperations were analyzed for causality. The incidence of adverse events served as a secondary safety outcome [19,22].

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of continuous variables.

For between-group comparisons of continuous data (VAS, PRUNE, CMAP, SNCV, MNCV, and functional scores), independent-sample t-tests were applied when data met normality assumptions. Paired-sample t-tests were used to compare preoperative and postoperative values within each group. For variables measured across multiple time points, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used where applicable. Categorical variables, such as the distribution of McGowan grades and the incidence of postoperative complications, were analyzed using chi-square (χ²) tests or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.

A two-sided P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all comparisons. Missing data due to loss to follow-up or incomplete records were excluded from analysis. No imputation was performed.

Given the retrospective nature of the study, a formal power analysis was not conducted; however, the sample size was sufficient to detect statistically significant differences in key outcome measures based on observed effect sizes.

To enhance the interpretability of statistically significant findings, between-group differences in continuous outcomes were supplemented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Cohen’s d effect sizes. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the difference in group means by the pooled standard deviation, which accounts for both group variances and sample sizes. Confidence intervals for mean differences were estimated based on standard error and normal distribution assumptions. These additional statistics were used to reflect not only statistical significance but also the magnitude and clinical relevance of observed differences.

A total of 114 patients were included, with 55 in the control group and 59 in the experimental group. The mean age was 52.53 ± 13.88 vs. 53.19 ± 13.80 years (p= 0.799). Sex distribution was similar: males accounted for 61.8% vs. 62.7% (p= 0.986), and females for 38.2% vs. 37.3% (p= 0.986)(Table1). Regarding affected side, right-sided cases were 67.3% vs. 69.5% (p= 0.777), left-sided 29.1% vs. 23.7% (p= 0.518), and bilateral 3.6% vs. 6.8% (p= 0.425). Preoperative McGowan grade distributions were also comparable: grade I, 18.2% vs. 18.6% (p= 0.957); grade II, 27.3% vs. 27.1% (p= 0.983); and grade III, 54.5% vs. 54.2% (p= 0.981).

Postoperative evaluations were conducted at 6 months, as previous literature suggests this period effectively captures nerve recovery and functional outcomes following cubital tunnel surgery.CMAP values increased in both groups at 6 months postoperatively (Table2a). In the control group, CMAP improved from 1.83 ± 0.44 mV to 6.02 ± 0.85 mV; in the experimental group, from 1.75 ± 0.32 mV to 5.40 ± 0.51 mV. The between-group mean difference in postoperative CMAP was − 0.62 mV (95% CI: − 0.88 to − 0.36), with Cohen’s d = − 0.89 andp< 0.001 (Table2b).

SNCV increased from 32.58 ± 5.31 m/s to 49.03 ± 4.55 m/s in the experimental group, and from 32.47 ± 7.53 m/s to 46.98 ± 5.71 m/s in the control group (Table2a). The postoperative between-group mean difference was 2.05 m/s (95% CI: 0.15 to 3.95), with Cohen’s d = 0.40 andp= 0.035 (Table3b).

MNCV improved from 31.29 ± 6.27 m/s to 49.84 ± 4.14 m/s in the experimental group, and from 34.31 ± 6.31 m/s to 46.44 ± 4.76 m/s in the control group (Table2a). The between-group mean difference in postoperative MNCV was 3.40 m/s (95% CI: 1.76 to 5.04), with Cohen’s d = 0.76 andp= 0.010 (Table3b).

At 6 months postoperatively, VAS pain scores decreased from 4.47 ± 0.87 to 1.72 ± 0.88 in the experimental group, and from 4.76 ± 1.13 to 2.76 ± 1.18 in the control group (Table4a). The between-group difference in postoperative VAS scores was − 1.04 (95% CI: − 1.42 to − 0.66), with Cohen’s d = − 1.00 andp< 0.001 (Table5b).

PRUNE scores decreased from 51.0 ± 8.28 to 27.22 ± 6.36 in the experimental group, and from 50.8 ± 11.71 to 33.16 ± 5.95 in the control group (Table4a). The between-group mean difference in postoperative PRUNE scores was − 5.94 (95% CI: − 8.20 to − 3.68), with Cohen’s d = − 0.96 andp< 0.001 (Table5b).

Postoperative Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Functional Scores were 10.77 ± 1.42 in the experimental group and 9.87 ± 1.34 in the control group (Table4a). The between-group mean difference was 0.90 points (95% CI: 0.39 to 1.41), with Cohen’s d = 0.65 andp= 0.0004 (Table5b).

2PD improved from 9.03 ± 1.92 mm to 5.94 ± 1.89 mm in the experimental group, and from 8.70 ± 1.86 mm to 5.65 ± 1.89 mm in the control group (Table2a). The between-group difference in postoperative 2PD was 0.29 mm (95% CI: − 0.40 to 0.98), with Cohen’s d = 0.15 andp= 0.407 (Table3b).

No infections, wound healing delays, or persistent neuralgia were recorded in either group. However, two patients in the control group required reoperation due to postoperative scar proliferation and recurrent nerve compression, confirmed by intraoperative exploration. All included patients completed follow-up evaluations at 6 months, and no adverse events were observed in the experimental group during the same period.

Classic surgical techniques—including subcutaneous transposition, simple decompression, and submuscular transposition—have been extensively utilized for the management of CuTS and generally yield satisfactory clinical outcomes [2,23]. However, each of these procedures is associated with inherent limitations, particularly regarding postoperative complications that continue to challenge long-term efficacy and patient satisfaction.

Subcutaneous transposition, although effective in alleviating ulnar nerve compression, has been frequently linked to excessive postoperative scar formation and restricted nerve gliding [24].For instance, Chang et al. reported that approximately 10.33% of 184 patients who underwent CuTS surgery experienced recurrent symptoms due to fibrotic scar proliferation at the transposition sit [25].This perineural fibrosis was believed to result from chronic inflammatory responses to absorbable sutures embedded in the subcutaneous layer, subsequently compromising the mobility of the ulnar nerve.

Deep transposition procedures, such as submuscular transposition, have also demonstrated specific drawbacks. Liu’s study highlighted that, although deeper approaches may better shield the nerve from external mechanical stress, they typically necessitate more extensive muscle dissection and soft tissue manipulation, which in turn increase the risks of adhesion formation and secondary fibrosi [26].Notably, some patients required revision neurolysis procedures within two years postoperatively due to these complications [27–29]. However, it is important to note that Liu’s findings were based on long-term outcomes spanning over two years, whereas the current study was limited to a six-month follow-up. Consequently, any direct comparison regarding long-term efficacy should be interpreted with caution. Additional studies with extended follow-up durations are essential to more comprehensively evaluate the durability and safety of each approach.

Other researchers, including Eroglu and Pagnotta, have emphasized that perineural scarring remains a principal cause of recurrent symptoms following conventional surgical decompression techniques [30].Although short-term symptom relief is often achieved, excessive fibrotic tissue can disrupt the physiological gliding of the ulnar nerve, thereby increasing the likelihood of recurrence. In an attempt to mitigate this issue, Burahee proposed the use of non-absorbable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes to reduce adhesion-related compression [31].While this strategy may be beneficial in select cases, its broader applicability is limited by increased procedural cost and potential biomaterial-related complications, highlighting the ongoing challenge of minimizing postoperative fibrosis.

In light of these persistent concerns, the percutaneous external suturing technique evaluated in our study may offer a promising alternative. By avoiding the placement of absorbable sutures in deep subfascial tissue, this approach may reduce local inflammatory responses and the risk of postoperative fibrosis. Recent histological and biomaterial investigations have demonstrated that absorbable suture materials, during their degradation phase, can provoke sustained inflammatory reactions, leading to fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, and ultimately dense perineural scar formation [32,33].

Dong et al. reported in a rat sciatic nerve model that absorbable sutures triggered fibroblast proliferation and macrophage infiltration around the nerve, which directly correlated with reduced axonal regeneration and impaired gliding function [34]. Similarly, Robertson and Saratsiotis underscored that mechanical traction, surgical manipulation, and suture-induced edema collectively contribute to perineural adhesion formation—an effect particularly pronounced within the anatomically confined cubital tunnel [35]. Elhassan further described a pathological feedback loop in which postoperative inflammation, fascial compression, and progressive fibrosis synergistically impair ulnar nerve mobility over time [36].

The percutaneous suturing technique may contribute to mitigating this pathological cycle by eliminating deep suture residues and minimizing mechanical disruption of the deep fascia. In doing so, it could help establish a more permissive microenvironment for nerve regeneration [37,38]. Furthermore, by limiting disruption to structurally and vascularly sensitive deep tissue planes, the technique may better preserve the physiological sliding capacity of the transposed nerve during the postoperative healing phase.

Within our six-month follow-up, the technique was associated with reasonable clinical safety and functional recovery.However, we recognize that the possibility of delayed complications—including late-onset fibrosis, recurrent compression, or infection—cannot be excluded based on short-term observation alone [39].Consequently, further prospective investigations with extended follow-up periods will be essential to fully elucidate the long-term biological and clinical implications of this approach.

The findings of this study indicate that percutaneous external suturing provided measurable improvements in early postoperative recovery compared to traditional subcutaneous fixation. Patients in the experimental group reported significantly lower postoperative pain, as reflected by VAS scores (1.72 ± 0.88 vs. 2.76 ± 1.18;p< 0.001). Additionally, improvements in PRUNE scores (27.22 ± 6.36 vs. 33.16 ± 5.95;p< 0.001) and Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Functional Scores (10.77 ± 1.42 vs. 9.87 ± 1.34;p= 0.0004) further support the potential benefits of this technique in promoting functional restoration of the ulnar nerve and elbow mobility.

From a neurophysiological standpoint, the experimental group demonstrated greater increases in sensory and motor conduction velocities—SNCV (16.45 m/s vs. 14.51 m/s;p= 0.035) and MNCV (18.55 m/s vs. 12.13 m/s;p= 0.010)—suggesting improved remyelination and nodal transmission.These conduction velocity metrics, which are less susceptible to variability from positioning or measurement artifacts, may more reliably reflect the biological recovery of neural pathways during the early postoperative period [40,41].

Interestingly, CMAP values improved in both groups but remained slightly higher in the control group at six months (6.02 ± 0.85 vs. 5.40 ± 0.51 mV;p< 0.001). This apparent discrepancy warrants nuanced interpretation. While CMAP amplitude is often used as a surrogate for motor unit recruitment and axonal continuity, it may also be influenced by local mechanical stability and recording conditions. The relatively higher CMAP in the control group could reflect transient advantages from deeper fascial anchoring, which may provide more rigid early alignment of the transposed nerve [42]. However, this benefit may come at the cost of increased fibrosis risk and reduced long-term nerve mobility.

More specifically, the deeper subcutaneous fixation may physically stabilize the nerve-muscle interface in the early healing phase, minimizing micromotion and enhancing the synchrony of motor unit activation. This improved alignment could lead to a more efficient summation of action potentials, thereby increasing the recorded CMAP amplitude. In contrast, the percutaneous method—designed to reduce soft tissue trauma—may allow more freedom of movement at the nerve-muscle junction early on, which could temporarily reduce the signal consistency during surface recording.

Graf et al. observed that CMAP amplitude in early stages correlates with structural fixation rigidity, suggesting that subcutaneous anchoring may enhance axon-muscle signal fidelity during the initial healing phase, despite its potential to increase scar burden [43].Dy further noted that collateral sprouting during axonal regeneration can obscure the predictive value of CMAP in the first 3–6 months, during which functional reinnervation may occur without proportional increases in action potential amplitude [44]. Additionally, Burahee emphasized that minor differences in fascial tension, vascular integrity, or inflammatory burden may transiently affect CMAP readings, which tend to normalize over time [31]. Therefore, the slightly attenuated CMAP response in the experimental group may reflect early-phase mechanical permissiveness rather than an intrinsic deficit in regeneration.

Taken together, the slightly higher CMAP in the control group may primarily result from enhanced mechanical stabilization of the nerve-muscle unit rather than superior axonal regeneration. Therefore, the slightly attenuated CMAP response in the experimental group may reflect early-phase mechanical permissiveness rather than an intrinsic deficit in regeneration.

Moreover, this electrophysiological difference did not align with clinical outcomes, as the percutaneous group demonstrated better pain relief, conduction velocity, and functional scores. Hence, CMAP should be interpreted as one dimension of recovery, and not as a standalone determinant of surgical success. In fact, when viewed alongside the broader neurophysiological profile, the percutaneous group exhibited significantly greater improvements in both sensory and motor conduction velocities (SNCV and MNCV), which are more directly reflective of axonal remyelination and nodal conduction recovery. These parameters are less susceptible to local tissue variability and more robust in capturing true neurobiological regeneration. The apparent discrepancy between CMAP and other electrophysiological indicators underscores the importance of interpreting nerve recovery using a composite, multidimensional framework. Thus, the slightly lower CMAP observed in the percutaneous group likely represents a localized mechanical or recording phenomenon, not an indication of inferior neural repair. When integrated with the totality of electrophysiological and clinical data, this difference does not detract from the overall finding that percutaneous fixation provides favorable short-term outcomes.

Future studies incorporating serial electrophysiological assessments and longer follow-up durations are needed to better characterize the trajectory of nerve recovery and verify whether the early-phase findings observed here persist or evolve over time.

The modified technique involves superficial fixation of the fascial flap, thereby avoiding direct manipulation of deeper soft tissues. By relocating the anchoring process to the skin level, this method reduces traction on the deep fascia and underlying neurovascular structures, potentially mitigating mechanical irritation and scar formation [45].Reducing contact between the fascial flap and the transposed ulnar nerve may preserve the gliding plane between them—an anatomical relationship considered essential for restoring normal elbow joint kinematics and minimizing dynamic entrapment during flexion-extension cycles.

Additionally, prior experimental and clinical studies have suggested that superficial suturing may preserve regional microcirculation by avoiding compression of subcutaneous vessels, which play a pivotal role in perineural perfusion. Nakamura emphasized the importance of maintaining local blood flow in promoting nerve regeneration, particularly during early postoperative revascularization [46].Lancigu similarly observed that smaller and more superficial surgical wounds are associated with a lower risk of postoperative infection, reinforcing the safety potential of less invasive fixation techniques [47].

Beyond clinical outcomes, this technique offers practical advantages. It simplifies the surgical workflow by eliminating the need for deep knot placement, potentially reducing operative time and dissection depth. Its minimally invasive nature may enhance early wound healing and patient satisfaction.

However, it also introduces specific limitations. The necessity of delayed suture removal (typically 10–14 days postoperatively) requires reliable follow-up and strict adherence to wound care protocols. External sutures, although generally well tolerated, may increase the risk of localized infection if not managed properly. Noncompliance with postoperative instructions or missed follow-up appointments could compromise outcomes and offset the benefits of reduced deep tissue disruption.

Furthermore, although early improvements in pain scores, conduction velocity, and functional indicators were observed, their long-term durability has not been established. The absence of long-term follow-up data precludes conclusions regarding delayed recurrence, chronic fibrosis, or the progression of perineural scarring. Additional investigations with extended follow-up periods are necessary to determine whether the early gains observed in the percutaneous group persist or converge with those of the subcutaneous group over time.

It is also important to reiterate that this study included only cases in which a fascial flap was already employed, and thus the findings are not generalizable to all CuTS procedures or to transpositions without fascial reinforcement. Moreover, the study did not incorporate imaging-based assessments (e.g., high-resolution ultrasound or MRI) or validated scar evaluation tools, which could have provided structural correlates of tissue integrity, perineural fibrosis, or nerve gliding.

As a retrospective cohort study, this analysis is also subject to inherent limitations in design, including the potential for selection bias and unmeasured confounding. Although baseline characteristics between groups were statistically comparable, the decision to use one fixation method over the other may have been influenced by surgeon preference or subtle intraoperative factors not captured in the dataset. Randomized controlled trials would be necessary to eliminate these potential sources of bias and to establish definitive causal relationships.

Taken together, the present findings suggest that even small technical refinements—such as the method of fascial flap fixation—can measurably influence early postoperative recovery. Nonetheless, the clinical relevance of these effects must be interpreted within the broader context of peripheral nerve surgery, where multiple intraoperative and perioperative factors act synergistically to shape outcomes.

Prospective randomized controlled trials, incorporating serial functional and electrophysiological assessments, larger sample sizes, and extended follow-up durations, are needed to validate these results and define optimal fixation strategies across diverse patient populations. Incorporation of objective intraoperative metrics—such as nerve excursion measurements, tissue strain analysis, or perfusion imaging—may also help elucidate the precise biomechanical and biological pathways through which fixation technique influences neural recovery.

In conclusion, this retrospective cohort study observed that percutaneous external fixation of a fascial flap during ulnar nerve transposition for cubital tunnel syndrome was associated with lower pain scores, reduced patient-reported disability, and differences in nerve conduction parameters at 6 months postoperatively, compared to subcutaneous suturing. No increase in perioperative complications was recorded. While the necessity of fascial flap use in primary decompression remains under discussion, the fixation method may be a contributing factor in postoperative recovery profiles. Percutaneous suturing represents a technically straightforward approach that warrants further investigation. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations and to assess their generalizability to wider surgical contexts.
