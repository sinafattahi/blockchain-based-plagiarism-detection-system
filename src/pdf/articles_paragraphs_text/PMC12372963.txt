The journal retracts the article “Role of Protein VII in the Production of Infectious Bovine Adenovirus-3 Virion” [1], cited above.

Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding the integrity of a number of images presented in this publication [1].

Adhering to our complaints procedure, an investigation was conducted by the Editorial Office and the Editorial Board confirmed image issues in Figures 1b, 2d (pUC304a,9dpi), 6b (IVa2), 7a (Tubulin), and 8 (CsCl). While the authors cooperated with the Editorial Office during the investigation and provided supporting material, they were unable to satisfactorily explain the image irregularities. As a result, the Editorial Board has lost confidence in the reliability of the findings and decided to retract this article [1] as per MDPI’s retraction policy (MDPI|Research and Publication Ethicshttps://www.mdpi.com/ethics#_bookmark30).

This retraction was approved by the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Viruses.
