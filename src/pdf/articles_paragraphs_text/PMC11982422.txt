Acupuncture has demonstrated efficacy in treating post‐stroke complications. Electroacupuncture (EA) ameliorates neurological outcomes in cerebral ischemia models, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated EA's role in reducing cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (CIRI) in a rat model, focusing on ferroptosis. A CIRI model was established via the MCAO/R method. Rats were randomly assigned to five experimental groups: Sham, MCAO/R, MCAO/R + COTI‐2, MCAO/R + EA and MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA. We evaluated neurological function with Zausinger scoring. 2,3,5‐Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining assessed infarct size, while haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining examined neuronal damage. Transmission electron microscopy analysed mitochondrial changes associated with ferroptosis, and Perl staining measured iron levels in neurons. The biomarkers associated with ferroptosis, including glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured. The expression ofp53,SLC7A11andGPX4was assessed by qRT‐PCR and Western blot. EA enhanced neurological function, reduced the infarct size, alleviated excessive serum iron accumulation, increased antioxidant markers (GSH, GPX4) and decreased lipid peroxidation levels (ROS, MDA), attenuating lipid peroxidation. Additionally, it reversed mitochondrial morphological changes associated with ferroptosis. qRT‐PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that EA downregulatedp53expression while upregulatingSLC7A11andGPX4expression. In summary, ferroptosis was activated after CIRI, and EA ameliorated neurological deficits in cerebral ischemia models by modulating the p53/SLC7A11 axis to counteract oxidative stress‐induced ferroptosis, ultimately providing neuroprotective benefits.

The global burden of disease database indicates a 70% rise in global stroke incidence and an 85% increase in prevalence from 1990 to 2019, particularly affecting younger patients [1]. About 87% of strokes are ischemic, primarily caused by blockage of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and its branches, with high mortality and morbidity rates, posing a significant threat to health [2,3]. CIRI, a key pathological mechanism in ischemic stroke, causes severe neurological impairment from the initial insult to reperfusion‐induced damage.

Ferroptosis constitutes metabolic cell death induced by oxidative stress [4]. Accumulating evidence from recent investigations has firmly established the involvement of ferroptosis in the pathophysiological process of CIRI [5,6]. Specifically, an overaccumulation of iron and heightened lipid peroxidation within the neuronal microenvironment are considered to be the major pathogenic factors contributing to neuronal damage during CIRI [7], implicating ferroptosis as a crucial component in the cascade of CIRI‐associated neurodegeneration.

As research on ferroptosis mechanisms advances, regulatory factors like glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) have emerged as key elements [8].SLC7A11acts as a cystine/glutamate antiporter, facilitating cystine and glutamate transport to sustain GSH homeostasis [9]. GPX4 is capable of employing GSH to convert lipid peroxides into their respective alcohols, mitigating lipid peroxidation and averting the onset of ferroptosis [10]. Numerous studies indicate that inhibitingSLC7A11or GPX4 activity significantly heightens neuronal susceptibility to ferroptosis, exacerbating CIRI; conversely, enhancing their activity can effectively mitigate ferroptosis and safeguard brain tissue [11,12].

Acupuncture has been recognised as a crucial complementary therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. It has multifaceted effects on various pathways and targets [13,14]. EA merges traditional techniques with electrical stimulation, enabling precise parameter control. Studies indicate that scalp acupuncture prevents neuronal ferroptosis via the Nrf2 signalling pathway in intracerebral haemorrhage models, while preemptive EA reduces infarct size, inhibits ferroptosis, and diminishes oxidative stress in ischemia–reperfusion injury models [15,16]. These findings suggest that EA has the potential to be a therapeutic approach for managing ferroptosis.

Although acupuncture has therapeutic effects on CIRI and can regulate ferroptosis‐related indicators, the molecular mechanisms at the signalling pathway level remain poorly understood. Research on the precise regulation of ferroptosis‐related pathways by acupuncture is scarce. For instance, in the p53/SLC7A11 signalling pathway,p53negatively regulatesSLC7A11and affects the ferroptosis process. Nevertheless, whether and how acupuncture can inhibit ferroptosis in CIRI through this pathway remains undetermined.

In this study, we aim to clarify the role of EA in CIRI by investigating its effect on ferroptosis, especially through the p53/SLC7A11signalling pathway. We will assess the impact of the p53 activator (COTI‐2) on CIRI‐affected neurons and explore how EA alleviates COTI‐2‐induced activation of this pathway to provide neuroprotection. This innovative research is anticipated to enhance the understanding of EA's mechanisms in treating CIRI.

To systematically evaluate the impacts of EA on cerebral activity in MCAO/R rats, we adopted Zausinger scoring for neurological assessment [17]. TTC staining was applied to measure cerebral infarction, and HE staining was conducted to evaluate neuronal death.

Compared with the Sham group, the MCAO/R group had significantly lower neurological scores (p< 0.01), which indicated a more severe neurological impairment in the MCAO/R group, while the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group exhibited even more substantial reductions (p< 0.01 vs. Sham;p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R). Conversely, both EA groups demonstrated improved scores (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R;p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R + COTI‐2) as illustrated in Figure1A.

HE staining revealed considerable neuronal cell necrosis in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus of the MCAO/R group, characterised by pyknosis, vacuolation, widened intercellular spaces and cellular oedema. The MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group exhibited more severe necrosis. However, the MCAO/R + EA and MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA groups had increased normal cell counts and better morphology, with reduced evidence of nuclear pyknosis and vacuolation (Figure1B). Furthermore, EA significantly promoted infarct recovery (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R). The MCAO/R + EA group experienced a significant reduction in infarct size compared to the MCAO/R group (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R), whereas COTI‐2 intervention worsened the infarction area (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R). Remarkably, EA alleviated this effect (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R + COTI‐2), as illustrated in Figure1C,D.

Prussian blue staining revealed that the Sham group had fewer iron‐rich aggregates in the cortical and hippocampal regions near the cerebral infarction. In contrast, the MCAO/R group showed a significant rise in iron accumulation (p< 0.01 vs. Sham), with a higher concentration in the cortex than in the hippocampus. The MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group exhibited a significant increase in iron deposition (p< 0.01 vs. Sham;p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R). Both the MCAO/R + EA group and the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA group demonstrated a decrease in iron aggregates (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R;p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R + COTI‐2), with MCAO/R + EA showing the least iron accumulation (Figure2A–C).

Additionally, to determine if ferroptosis occurred in MCAO/R rat brain tissue, we assessed mitochondrial morphology in infarcted regions using transmission electron microscopy. All groups except the Sham exhibited varying degrees of mitochondrial shrinkage, swelling, and loss of cristae, which are typical features supporting evidence of ferroptosis. Notably, the MCAO/R + EA and the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA groups displayed an increase in normal mitochondria, with restored cristae structures, indicating that EA can partially ameliorate mitochondrial structural damage (Figure3).

Red arrows point to shrunken mitochondria; yellow arrows show swollen mitochondria with cristae decreased or disappeared; and green arrows refer to rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane (bar = 2 μm;n= 3).

We evaluated GSH, ROS and MDA levels to analyse oxidative stress induced by COTI‐2 in CIRI neurons. We also investigated whether EA could alleviate this response. The MCAO/R group showed increased ROS in the ischemic penumbra (p< 0.01 vs. Sham), alongside heightened MDA (p< 0.01 vs. Sham) and reduced GSH (p< 0.01 vs. Sham) in the hippocampal tissue of the affected area. In comparison to the MCAO/R, the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group exhibited elevated ROS (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R) and MDA (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R), along with lower GSH levels (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R). The MCAO/R + EA group displayed decreased ROS (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R) and MDA (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R), while GSH levels increased (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R). When compared to the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group, the MCAO/R+ COTI‐2 + EA group showed reduced ROS (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R) and MDA (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R), along with elevated GSH (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R) (Figure4A–C).

MCAO/R group;▲p< 0.05,▲▲p< 0.01, versus MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group.

Regarding serum iron levels, both the MCAO/R and the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 groups displayed significantly increased free iron levels (p< 0.01 vs. the Sham). The MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group had notably higher free iron levels compared to the MCAO/R group (p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R group), while the MCAO/R + EA group demonstrated decreased serum iron levels (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R group). The MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA group exhibited a marked reduction in iron content compared to MCAO/R + COTI‐2 (p< 0.01 vs. the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group), as depicted in Figure4D.

These findings suggested a potential causal link between the amelioration of ferroptosis markers and the observed neuroprotection, warranting further mechanistic investigation.

To further clarify EA's role in regulating ferroptosis mediated by COTI‐2, this study employed Western blot analysis to assess the protein levels ofp53,GPX4andSLC7A11. After a 3‐day treatment, the MCAO/R group showed a significant decline inSLC7A11(p< 0.01 vs. Sham) andGPX4(p< 0.01 vs. Sham) in the hippocampal region following ischemia–reperfusion, whilep53expression increased (p< 0.01 vs. Sham). Inversely, the MCAO/R + EA group demonstrated higher levels ofSLC7A11(p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R) andGPX4(p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R), alongside a decrease inp53expression (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R). After COTI‐2 administration, increasedp53(p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R) and reduced levels of GPX4 (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R) andSLC7A11(p< 0.05 vs. MCAO/R). The MCAO/R + EA + COTI‐2 group presented lowerp53expression (p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R + COTI‐2), but increasedGPX4(p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R + COTI‐2) andSLC7A11(p< 0.01 vs. MCAO/R + COTI‐2) levels (Figure5A–D). The qRT‐PCR analysis of brain tissues confirmed the mRNA expression patterns forp53,GPX4, andSLC7A11match previous protein expression results (Figure5E). In conclusion, increasedp53reducesSLC7A11andGPX4in MCAO/R, especially in MCAO/R + COTI‐2. However, EA restores these levels, demonstrating its ability to modulate the p53/SLC7A11 signalling pathway, thus counteracting ferroptosis and repairing CIRI damage.

Notably, in the context of COTI‐2‐induced ferroptosis exacerbation, EA intervention reverses ferroptosis markers and neuronal damage through the p53/SLC7A11 signalling pathway, suggesting that the inhibition of ferroptosis is a prerequisite for EA‐mediated neuroprotection, rather than a secondary consequence.

CIRI results in lasting neurological impairments, including disabilities and cognitive deficits, which pose considerable social and economic challenges [18]. Previous investigations have established that the interplay between iron overload and lipid pathways significantly impacts the progression of CIRI [19]. Therefore, targeting ferroptosis is crucial for alleviating CIRI. Acupuncture, a prominent therapeutic intervention in traditional Chinese medicine, demonstrated great potential in pertinent research areas. Research has highlighted that acupuncture effectively combats oxidative damage and inflammation post‐ischemia–reperfusion injury [20].

In our investigation of neural function impairments in rats and examinations of cerebral infarction regions, we observed that EA significantly enhanced the neuro‐system recovery in MCAO/R rats. HE staining supported the conclusion that EA diminishes neuronal necrosis caused by CIRI. These findings robustly validated EA's clinical potential for CIRI management. Furthermore, we evaluated iron overload through Prussian blue staining and serum iron concentrations. MCAO/R rats showed signs of iron deposition, while COTI‐2 significantly increased iron accumulation. Earlier research identified abnormal iron metabolism during CIRI, noting an excessive buildup of free iron within brain tissue, increased mitochondrial ferritin, and serum iron overload [21,22]. Iron's critical role as a haemoglobin component significantly threatens neural cells, initiating Fenton reactions that generate various hydroxyl free radicals. This mechanism intensifies oxidative stress, inflicting damage on cellular structures and potentially leading to ferroptosis [23]. Notably, the EA intervention mitigated iron deposition, which highlighted its neuroprotective potential by lowering excess iron and preventing ferroptosis. These results align with previous studies on acupuncture's effects on iron metabolism [24].

Ferroptosis cells display characteristic mitochondrial morphological changes, including volume reduction or swelling, cristae loss, increased membrane density, and potential outer membrane rupture. The study evidenced ferroptosis in brain ischemia–reperfusion tissue via mitochondrial changes observed by electron microscopy [25]. We assessed lipid peroxidation injury associated with ferroptosis through GSH depletion, ROS, and MDA concentration measurements. While ROS is essential for tissue homeostasis, excessive levels harm cells, leading to death [26]. GSH plays a crucial role in eliminating ROS during ferroptosis. Inadequate ROS clearance can trigger lipid peroxidation, leading to elevated levels of MDA and subsequently inducing ferroptosis. Elevated MDA, an indirect marker of oxidative stress, is a key feature of ferroptosis and promotes its progression during CIRI [27]. The MCAO/R group showed lower GSH and higher ROS and MDA levels, while the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group had even worse outcomes. EA intervention reduced oxidative stress, raised GSH, and decreased ROS and MDA. Collectively, these findings confirmed that COTI‐2 accelerates ferroptosis in CIRI rat neurons, whereas EA not only alleviated iron accumulation and oxidative stress induced by CIRI but also mitigated the pro‐ferroptotic effects of COTI‐2, thereby providing neuroprotection.

Although prior studies have confirmed the neuroprotective effects of acupuncture on CIRI, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. To clarify whether the improvement of ferroptosis is the underlying protective mechanism or secondary to neuroprotection, we analysed the expression of key genes and proteins in the ferroptosis pathway.p53, referred to as the ‘guardian of the genome’, regulates cell survival and division under stress [28, p. 87]. Its expression levels remain low in normal tissues. However, ischemia and reperfusion injury trigger oxidative stress, resulting inp53accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix [29]. Under oxidative stress conditions, phosphorylation ofp53at Serine 15 enhances its transcriptional activity [30]. We hypothesise that EA may suppressp53phosphorylation at Serine 15, thereby reducing its binding affinity to theSLC7A11gene promoter and upregulatingSLC7A11expression. This would enhance cystine uptake, elevate GSH levels, increase GPX4 activity, and ultimately inhibit ferroptosis.

By introducing COTI‐2, a p53 agonist, we specifically observed molecular changes related to ferroptosis. Our findings indicate that, compared with the MCAO/R group without COTI‐2 administration, the MCAO/R + COTI‐2 group exhibited a further increase inp53expression, along with a further reduction inSLC7A11andGPX4expression. This was accompanied by a significant increase in iron ion accumulation and lipid peroxidation levels, leading to more severe neuronal damage. These results suggest that COTI‐2 exacerbates CIRI‐induced neuronal damage by activatingp53and promoting ferroptosis. Conversely, EA intervention in this study was able to inhibit the activation ofp53by COTI‐2, leading to decreasedp53expression, upregulation ofSLC7A11andGPX4expression, and a reduction in iron ion accumulation and lipid peroxidation. This mechanism aligns with recent findings on ferroptosis regulation, thereby reinforcing the conclusions of this study [31]. This indicates that EA's neuroprotective effect is not merely a consequence of global injury reduction but involves direct targeting of the p53/SLC7A11 axis to inhibit ferroptosis. While our data strongly implicated ferroptosis as a key mechanism, we acknowledged that EA may exert additional neuroprotective effects. Future studies using conditional knockout models or time‐course analyses of ferroptosis markers will further clarify the hierarchy of EA's mechanisms.

We used male rats in this study due to their cerebrovascular similarities to humans and consistent experimental outcomes [32]. This approach streamlined experimental design, enhanced manageability, and adhered to ethical guidelines. However, the potential influence of sex‐based hormonal differences, such as oestrogen's impact on ferroptosis during CIRI, necessitates future investigations. Subsequent studies should incorporate female rats to validate our findings regarding EA's effect and elucidate the neuroprotective roles of hormones like oestrogen. This will address sex‐specific responses and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

This study elucidates the mechanism by which EA inhibits ferroptosis, thereby attenuating CIRI damage via the p53/SLC7A11 signalling pathway, offering cellular and molecular insights into acupuncture's neuroprotective effects and supporting the modernisation of acupuncture theory. While this study offers novel insights into therapeutic strategies for CIRI, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The relatively small sample size may affect the generalisability of the findings. Furthermore, the complex interactions between the p53/SLC7A11 signalling pathway and other pathways, as well as the effects of acupuncture modulation on these related pathways, remain unclear and require further investigation. Future studies should prioritise larger sample sizes and in‐depth analyses of multi‐pathway interactions, such as integrating proteomics and metabolomics techniques to comprehensively analyse the effects of acupuncture on CIRI‐related signalling pathways. This will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying acupuncture treatment for CIRI and promote the development of related therapeutic strategies.

The rodents used in this study were sourced from the Laboratory Animal Centre (licence number: SYXK (Jin 2021–0003)). All experiments adhered to the Tianjin Medical Experimental Animal Care guidelines, approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yi Sheng Yuan Gene Technology (Protocol #YSY‐DWLL‐2022348) in compliance with ARRIVE guidelines 2.0.

This study selected SPF‐grade male Wistar rats (250–300 g, 9–11 weeks). They lived in a controlled environment (20°C–25°C, 55% ± 15% humidity) with a 12‐h light–dark cycle and had unrestricted access to food and water. Following a 7‐day acclimatisation period, no sample size calculation was performed. Animals were grouped to align with similar middle cerebral artery ischaemia model (MCAO/R) studies. All procedures complied with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as per the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.

We employed the enhanced Zea Longa line occlusion technique to establish MCAO/R rats [33]. Rats underwent a 12‐h fast and were administered isoflurane anaesthesia. Positioned dorsally on a surgical board, their necks were shaved and disinfected, followed by a 2 cm midline incision. Surgeons exposed the space between the right sternocleidomastoid and sternohyoid muscles and dissected the right common, internal, and external carotid arteries, ligating the external carotid. An arterial clamp was applied to the common carotid artery at the bifurcation. A 1 mL syringe needle punctured the proximal vessel wall to insert a 0.20 mm nylon thread, advancing it 18–20 mm into the internal carotid artery until resistance was felt to occlude the MCA. After placement, the common carotid artery and needle hole were ligated. Two hours later, the thread was withdrawn for reperfusion, while the Sham group underwent dissection without thread insertion. Body temperature and respiratory rate were monitored continuously.

In the preliminary study, rats were randomly assigned to Sham or MCAO/R groups. Researchers confirmed the MCAO/R model's validity using the Zausinger scoring system [17], ranging from 0 to 5. A lower score indicated more severe neurological deficits. Scores of 0, 4, or 5, along with dead animals, were excluded. Only rats Scoring 1, 2 or 3 proceeded to the next stage. The criteria for the Zausinger scoring are defined as follows: a score of 0 indicates an inability to initiate walking; a score of 1 shows spontaneous turning towards the unaffected side during free movement; a score of 2 involves grasping the tail, causing a turn towards the affected side; a score of 3 reflects decreased resistance to pressure on the affected side; a score of 4 indicates difficulty extending the forelimb on the affected side, often resulting in a lean towards the unaffected side and a score of 5 signifies no neurological deficits present.

The follow‐up research divided the rats into Sham, MCAO/R, MCAO/R + COTI‐2, MCAO/R + EA and MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA groups, each with 20 rats. Following 3 days of procedures according to the experimental protocol, samples were collected from all five groups.

Dosing schedule: The MCAO/R + COTI‐2 and MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA groups started treatment 2 h post‐modelling. They received a daily dose of 15 mg/kg of COTI‐2 via intraperitoneal injection. Other groups received 1 mL of physiological saline daily, assigned according to their groups until the observation period ended.

Acupuncture Technique: Acupuncture was localised and performed on rats by integrating their anatomical structures and surface landmarks, referring to a human acupoint map [34]. The MCAO/R + EA and MCAO/R + COTI‐2 + EA groups underwent acupuncture and received EA treatment twice a day, at 10:00 and 16:00. The treatment started 24 h post‐modelling and continued for 3 days. Other groups received Sham treatment without acupuncture. The GV26 point (Shuigou) is located at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the nasolabial groove. The PC6 point (Neiguan) is on the medial side of the forelimb, 3 mm above the wrist, between the ulna and radius. The SP6 point (San yinjiao) is found 1 cm directly above the tip of the medial malleolus on the hindlimb (Figure6). Needles were inserted vertically into the PC6 point to a depth of 1 mm. The GV26 point was needled at a 45°angle to a depth of 1 mm using a finch pecking acupuncture technique and then inserted perpendicularly into the SP6 point to a depth of 3 mm. The Han's nerve acupoint stimulator (model SDZ‐II) was applied to the PC6 and SP6 acupoints using a 2 Hz/15 Hz sparse‐dense wave at an intensity of 1 mA, and the stimulation was maintained for 20 min.

Acupuncture points in rats were determined using a transpositional method. (A–C) Location of GV26, PC6 and SP6 on humans. (D) Schematic diagram of GV26, PC6 and SP6 on a rat. Shui gou (GV26) is at the junction of the upper and lower thirds of the groove of the nose and upper lip; Nei guan (PC6) is located on the inner side of the arm, 2 in. above the transverse stripe on the distal side of the palm of the wrist; San yin jiao (SP6) is on the inner side of the lower leg, 3 in. above the tip of the inner ankle, behind the medial edge of the tibia bone.

The neurological function of the rats was evaluated on the day of surgery, before the initial acupuncture treatment (24 h post‐model establishment), and on Day 3 of treatment. Three rats were selected from each group to obtain serum samples, which were stored at −20°C for subsequent serum iron analysis. The rats were then euthanised by cervical dislocation, and brain tissue was collected. Fresh samples were analysed by flow cytometry, while the remaining samples were stored at −80°C for further analysis.

Neurological impairments were evaluated by a certified specialist who was not involved in surgical modelling or acupuncture techniques. Assessments were performed on the day of surgery and 3 days post‐treatment, employing a Zusinger 6‐point scale, where lower scores reflect greater impairment. The scale ranges from 0 (complete dysfunction) to 5 (normal functionality). The criteria for the Zausinger scoring are defined as follows: a score of 0 indicates an inability to initiate walking; a score of 1 shows spontaneous turning towards the unaffected side during free movement; a score of 2 involves grasping the tail, causing a turn towards the affected side; a score of 3 reflects decreased resistance to pressure on the affected side; a score of 4 indicates difficulty extending the forelimb on the affected side, often resulting in a lean towards the unaffected side and a score of 5 signifies no neurological deficits present.

Brain tissue samples from the frontal to occipital poles were sliced into 3 mm coronal sections and stained with 2% 2,3,5‐triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; LOT: M21HS175453; Shanghai Yuan Ye Bio‐Technology Co. Ltd.) at 37°C for 30 min in the dark. The infarct region was evaluated using Image‐Pro Plus 6.0 software. The infarction percentage was calculated as follows: Infarction Rate (%) = [(Contralateral hemisphere volume − Normal volume of the infarcted side)/Contralateral hemisphere volume] × 100%.

The brain tissue was processed into 5‐μm‐thick paraffin sections. The slices were then subjected to Xylene I and Xylene II for 20 min each to remove paraffin. Subsequently, the sections were rehydrated for 3 min each using a descending ethanol gradient: 100%, 95%, 85%, 75% and 70%. Afterward, Perls' staining solution (80 mL, 20% HCl and 80 mL, 10% potassium ferrocyanide) was applied to the sections for 20 min, followed by three rinses with distilled water. The sections were then incubated with the enhanced staining solution at 37°C for 15 min, followed by gentle washing with 1 × PBS three times, each for 5 s. Counterstaining was performed for 5 min. Finally, the sections were dehydrated with absolute ethanol, cleared with xylene, and sealed with neutral resin.

Brain tissue samples underwent graded ethanol dehydration, xylene clearing and paraffin embedding, followed by sectioning into 4 μm slices. Sections were deparaffinised with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol. They were stained with haematoxylin solution (Plate Number 1, Beijing Zhongsui Jinqiao Biotechnology Co. Ltd.) for 5 min and eosin solution (Plate Number 2, Beijing Zhongsui Jinqiao Biotechnology Co. Ltd.) for 3 min. Following ethanol dehydration and xylene permeabilisation, sections were mounted with neutral resin. Nuclei were stained blue with haematoxylin, while the cytoplasm was stained pink. Samples were examined under a transmitted light microscope (CKX43‐LP, Olympus), and images were captured for analysis.

Brain tissue samples were extracted from the infarct foci and corresponding areas of 1 mm3tissue. The samples were embedded and prepared into ultra‐thin sections (60–80 nm thick). These sections were then subjected to lead‐uranium double staining and negative staining, following the standard operating procedure (SOP) for tissue section preparation on copper mesh grids. The stained sections were observed and photographed under the transmission electron microscope (HT7800, Hitachi, Japan).

A single‐cell suspension from the ischemic penumbra (the area surrounding the core infarct region with compromised blood supply but potentially salvageable neurons) was prepared via mechanical dissociation of fresh rat brain tissue. The dissociated cells were filtered through a 300‐mesh sieve and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (P1020, Solarbio). The probe was diluted to 10 μM in serum‐free medium or PBS, mixed with the cell pellet, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min with gentle mixing every 3–5 min. The probe‐labelled suspension was centrifuged again at 300 g for 5 min, washed one to two times with PBS, and the pellet was collected for fluorescence analysis. The pellet was resuspended in PBS for flow cytometry. The flow cytometer (NovoCyte 2000, Agilent) was set to an excitation wavelength of 500 nm (500 ± 15 nm) and an emission wavelength of 525 nm (530 ± 20 nm) for FITC detection.

GSH (#A006‐2‐1) and MDA (#A003‐1) assay kits were purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute. The cerebral cortex on the ischemic side of rats was collected to prepare tissue homogenate. The microplate method was used for GSH detection. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a microplate reader, and the GSH content was calculated according to the standard curve. The TBARS method was adopted for MDA detection. Given the possible interfering substances in the samples, the absorbances at 532, 600 and 450 nm were measured using a spectrophotometer. The MDA concentration was corrected using the formula ‘MDA concentration = 6.45 × (A532 − A600) − 0.56 × A450’, where A532, A600 and A450 represented the absorbances at the corresponding wavelengths. The MDA content was then calculated based on the standard concentration.

On the day of intervention completion, 2 mL of blood was collected from the abdominal aorta of each rat using a heparin‐coated syringe to prevent coagulation. The blood samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to separate the serum. The serum was filtered through a 0.22‐μm filter to remove any remaining cellular debris and stored at‐20°C until analysis. Serum iron levels were measured using an automatic biochemical analyser (BS‐240VET, Shenzhen Mindray, China) via a colorimetric technique.

Ischemic hippocampal samples (30 mg) from rats were isolated using a grinder (Wuhan Seville, KZ‐III‐F). Total protein was extracted with RIPA buffer, and its concentration was measured using a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS‐PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 2% BSA (Biyuntian, P0252‐100 mL) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies:GPX4(17 kDa, 1:1000, Abcam, ab125066),p53(53 kDa, 1:1000, Abcam, ab175186),SLC7A11(55 kDa, 1:5000, Abcam, ab131442) and β‐tubulin (55 kDa, 1:2000, Zhongshu Jinqiao, batch: 220010627).

After three washes with TBST (0.1% Tween‐20), the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature: Goat Anti‐Rabbit IgG (ZB‐2301) and Goat Anti‐Mouse IgG (ZB‐2305). Following additional washes, the membranes were exposed and developed. Protein expression levels were quantified using ImageJ (version 1.52; NIH) by normalising the grayscale values of target proteins to β‐tubulin.

Fifty milligrams of ischemic hippocampal tissue were collected from rats for total RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#15596018). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by UV spectrophotometry. The OD260/OD280 ratios of all samples ranged from 1.8 to 2.0, indicating high‐purity RNA. RNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, showing distinct 28S and 18S rRNA bands.

Equal quantities of RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using the RR047A reagent kit (Takara). Real‐time quantitative PCR was performed in a 20‐μL reaction volume under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s (denaturation) and 62°C for 1 min (annealing and extension). β‐actin was used as the internal control for normalisation. The relative expression levels ofGPX4,SLC7A11andp53mRNA were determined using the 2−ΔΔCtmethod. Primer sequences are detailed in Table1.

GraphPad Prism version 10.0.2 enabled data visualisation and statistical analysis. To verify the normality of data distribution, we used the Shapiro–Wilk test (α= 0.05). Normally distributed data (p> 0.05) were expressed as mean ± SD. One‐way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used for multiple group comparisons. Non‐normally distributed data (p< 0.05) were analysed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn's post hoc test, and were presented as median ± IQR.pValue under 0.05 signified statistical significance.
