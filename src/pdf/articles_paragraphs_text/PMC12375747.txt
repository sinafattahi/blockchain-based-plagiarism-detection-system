The Biogeochemical cycles are crucial for aquatic ecosystems, particularly the functioning of nutrient cycles. Growing anthropogenic pressure alters their functioning, causing accelerated eutrophication. Understanding the scale of alteration in ecological functions could assist with combat strategies. Bacterial communities regulate the transition of functional traits in aquatic ecosystems. However, current knowledge is still elusive regarding the variability of the environmental drivers dictating the functional roles in dynamic regimes like littoral zones. This study assessed how seasonal and circumlimnal conditions influenced sediment characteristics, bacterioplankton communities, and putative ecological functions (specifically biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur) in the hypertrophic freshwater Lake Pichola (Rajasthan, India). Findings suggest a significant seasonal drivers’ influence on sediment characteristics, while the anthropopressure-aided niche partitioning promoted species richness and diversity in the hypertrophic lake. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes were abundant phyla; chemoheterotrophy and fermentation are the dominant potential putative functions; methylotrophy, nitrate reduction, and sulfate reduction are prominent nutrient cycling biogeochemical functions. Redundancy analysis accurately explained the influence of sediment characteristics on the variability of biogeochemical functions. Shifts in bacterioplankton communities were evident within circumlimnal regimes with greater anthropogenic stress, promoting higher abundance and diversity of putative bacteria orchestrating the ecological functions. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the interplay among the functional traits and environmental factors dynamics in littoral sediments for studying biogeochemical transformation in lakes.

Human activities and climate change are foremost responsible for the extensive alteration of freshwater ecosystems on the Earth. Freshwater lakes constitute 90% of the global freshwater resources, covering just 2.8% of the land surface1. Pertinent wastewater discharge from industries, sewage outflow from dense urban centers, and agricultural runoff primarily add nutrients (carbon (C), nitrogen (N), & phosphorous (P)) and other pollutants in lakes2. Although nutrients are crucial for sustaining life, excessive nutrient loadings (C, N, & P) through anthropogenic activities cause alteration in these systems, including changes in trophic state, physico-chemical characteristics, and microbial communities3. Long-term accumulation of these nutrients could accelerate eutrophication, causing ecosystem degradation.

Microorganisms, being sensitive, are the first to sustain the impacts of these alterations and could serve as ecosystem monitors and influence several ecological roles governed by microbiota, primarily energy transport and material cycling (C, N, P, and sulphur (S))4. From the perspective of biogeochemical cycling, bacteria, and archaea are fundamentally crucial for ecological roles like the transformation of organic matter, nutrients, and pollutant degradation5. Examining their community structure could provide insights into the scale of these processes and assess ecosystem damage and their resilience toward these alterations. Technological advancements have replaced conventional laboratory cultures to study microbial communities with culture-independent high-throughput sequencing of the variable regions of 16S ribosomal rRNA gene with the help of efficient sequencing platforms like Illumina MiSeq6. As the material cycling and energy transport occur at the sediment–water interface, lake sediments, and above-water columns have become extensive subjects of metagenomic analysis and next-generation sequencing, generating vast amplicon and shotgun metagenomic records7.

The standalone richness and diversity estimate for prokaryotic species and community composition do not provide a clear understanding of the ecosystem functions8; therefore, in addition to community composition data, it is equally important to assess functional profiles. Shotgun metagenomics accurately represents both taxonomic and functional profiles for microbes, but has constraints like selective gene amplification, relatively higher cost per sample, and challenges with data processing9. Alternatively, in ecosystems with little background information on community composition or initial screening is the study’s objective, certain bioinformatics tools can be used to predict the functional profile of microbial communities based on taxonomic data obtained after sequencing10–12.

Biogeochemical cycling is a crucial ecosystem function performed by bacteria present in lake sediments and water columns. Since bacterial community composition is highly dynamic, sharp changes in water regimes likely have far-reaching effects on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning in lakes. Nutrient cycling is a complex multi-step process, and apart from its physico-chemical counterparts, a variety of bacterial taxa might be involved at each step, exhibiting interactions within its community. A holistic approach should account for seasonal and circumlimnal conditions variability in the relationship between sediment characteristics and bacterial communities for a comprehensive understanding of sediment functions. Moreover, assessing bacterial community composition in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes might be common. Still, only a few studies have tried to determine the ecological functions of bacterial communities13,14. In contrast, a systematic study should account for community composition explaining the interactions15, ecological and biogeochemical functions for functional profiling16, the role of spatial and temporal changes in modulating the transformative rates of biogeochemical processes17, and the influence of physico-chemical and environmental drivers18under the freshwater ecosystems.

Current knowledge about the association between freshwater bacterial diversity and the environmental drivers governing the functional roles of freshwater bacterial communities is far from comprehensive, and their variability along different seasons and circumlimnal constraints is not very well accounted for within the highly dynamic littoral sediments of freshwater lakes. Considering the above rationale and the research gap, we framed a hypothesis that the interplay among circumliminal conditions and seasonal changes in dynamic littoral zones moderates environmental factors (physico-chemical characteristics), which in turn mediates the microbial community and associated biogeochemical functions. Therefore, this study aims to quantify key sediment physico-chemical parameters of littoral sediments, followed by estimation of bacterial community characteristics to infer overall putative ecological functions, mainly targeting the functions associated with biogeochemical cycling and influence from seasonal and circumlimnal factors. This study could provide deep insights into environmental forces that determine circumlimnal and seasonal differences in bacterial communities’ composition and alterations within the biogeochemical functions. Understanding the nutrient cycles in lakes could contribute to designing, evaluating, and establishing countermeasures to combat eutrophication-associated negative socio-economic impacts and maintain the aesthetic value of lakes.

The sampling site was Lake Pichola (LP) from Udaipur District, Rajasthan State, located in the northwest part of India at a mean elevation of 598 m with semi-arid climatic conditions. The district receives most of its rainfall during the monsoon season (July–September), and the region recorded 805 mm of mean annual rainfall in the past decade. The monthly mean temperatures range from 7 ºC in winter and peak up to 39.8 ºC during summer. Udaipur is a popular destination among international and national tourists, addressed by epithets like “City of Lakes”, and “Venice of the East”19–21.

LP is an artificial freshwater lake that extends within 73º41′12′′ E – 73º39′40″ E longitude and 24º33′20″ N – 24º35′30″ N latitude (Fig.1), with water spread covering a 6.96 km2area. The lake was constructed to fulfill domestic water demand during the dry season, due to which major establishments settled around the northern part of the lake. Presently, with an increase in its popularity, the lake is under severe anthropogenic stress19,22due to activities like leakage from conventional sewage pipelines situated within the lake boundary, an increase in rooftop restaurants and luxury hotels that discharge their untreated organic waste directly into the lake, along with recreational activities like boat rides22. This has resulted in the production of algal bloom (Microcystis sp.)23and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)as the floating type,Hydrilla verticillataas the submerged type, andPaspalidium germinatumas the emergent type macrophyte growth within the lake24. Conversely, the southern part of the lake is covered with scrub vegetation and less permeable clayey loam soil that serves as a nesting site for several local and migratory birds. The western part had inflow from the Sisarma River channel, and the eastern part had an embankment with three outflows: two towards the north and one towards the southern end.

Study area map with littoral sediment sampling sites of Lake Pichola in Udaipur District of Rajasthan State, India. Lake Pichola sampling sites (n = 19) with different markers represent a separate composite group based on the four (PI-PIV) distinct circumlimnal conditions around the lake. ArcGIS v10.6 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) is used to create the study area map. Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) thematic data was sourced as a Web Map Service (WMS) layer from NRSC Bhuvan portal (National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO. (2015–2016). Land Use Land Cover (1:50,000) – Rajasthan [Web Map Service layer]. Bhuvan.https://bhuvan-vec2.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan/wms(Accessed on May 24, 2024)).

Littoral sites in Lake Pichola were surveyed for sampling site selection, deeming the ease of access, considering circumlimnal conditions like point sources for pollutants, land use land cover (LULC), anthropogenic activity, and stream inflow. Accordingly, LP was divided into four groups (PI-PIV), and nineteen sites were selected to collect littoral sediment samples; representing all circumlimnal conditions. The sampling was conducted for three seasons, i.e. pre-monsoon (PR) in May month, monsoon (MO) in the month of September, and post-monsoon (PM) in the month of January within the year 2022–2023. The samples (approx. 10 g) were collected using a 22 cm long sterile stainless-steel spatula which can dig up to 15–20 cm below the surface. Where emergent macrophytes were available, rhizospheric sediments were collected. The sediment slurry was transferred into the sterile 50 mL falcon tubes. The caps of the falcons were sealed with parafilm and later transported in an ice box to the laboratory, where they were stored under −20 ºC before analysis. Additionally, replicate littoral sediment samples (~ 50 g) from all the sites were collected for physico-chemical analysis of samples in zipped bags and were stored at 4 ºC for physico-chemical and elemental analysis.

Sediment pH and oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) were measured in situ using portable electrodes Lutron PH-220S and Labtronics-LT50, respectively. Bulk density (BD) was estimated through the replicate sediment core collected using a corer, and dry mass was measured, which was divided against the known volume of the corer to obtain density. Soil moisture (SM) was estimated by a soil moisture meter (Precisa XM 60). Sediment organic matter (SOM) was estimated through titrimetric measurement of total organic carbon content in sediment samples25. All measurements were repeated 5 times. 5 g of sediment sample from all the sites was oven dried at 60 ºC, sieved (63 µ) to obtain a homogenous fraction, and stored in air-tight capped vials for elemental analysis. Total nitrogen (TN) and total carbon (TC) were estimated for all sediment samples (~ 40 mg) through the elemental analyser (Elementar-Vario EL cube).

Approximately 0.5 g (wet mass) of twelve composite sediment samples (PI-PIV) for three seasons (PR, MO, & PM) was used to extract metagenomic DNA through a commercially available Nucleospin Soil Kit (MN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality (purity and concentration) of the extracted metagenomic DNA from 12 samples was analyzed using NanoDrop by determining the A260/A280ratio.

High-throughput sequencing of bacteria was performed by selecting highly variable V3-V4 regions to generate the first amplicons. The primers used during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification were 341F (5′-GCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-ACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′), designed and synthesized at Eurofins Genomics Lab. The PCR reaction used the Kapa HiFi HotStart mix (Roche). The reaction mixture (50 µL) contains 2 × pre-mix Taq (25 µL), forward and reverse primer (1 µL), DNA (3 µL), and nuclease-free water (20 µL). The PCR conditions are as follows: (1) Initial denaturation (one cycle) at 95 ºC for 3 min (2) Twenty-five cycles of a) denaturation at 95 ºC for 30 s b) renaturation at 55 ºC for 30 s c) extension at 72 ºC for 30 s (3) Final extension (1 cycle) at 72 ºC for 5 min followed by 4 ºC hold. For quality assessment of the PCR product, 3 µL of the product was resolved on 1.2% Agarose gel along with 100 bp DNA ladder RTU (GeneDireX) at 120 V for approximately 60 min or until the sample reached 3/4thof the gel.

The amplicon library was prepared using Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina Inc.) as per the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol (Part # 15,044,223 Rev. B, Illumina, USA). The QC-passed amplicons with Illumina adaptors were amplified using i5 and i7 primers to add multiplexing index sequences and common adapters for cluster generation as per the standard Illumina protocol. The amplified libraries were purified by AMPureXP beads and quantified using Qubit 4.0 (Thermo Fisher). The quality of amplified libraries was analyzed on Bioanalyser 4200 Tape Station (Agilent Technologies) using D1000 Screen Tape as per manufacturer instructions. Based on the mean peak size from the tape station profile, libraries were loaded onto the Illumina MiSeq Platform using 2 × 300 bp chemistry at an appropriate concentration (10–20 pM) for cluster generation and sequencing.

High-quality pair end (PE) reads were obtained using Trimmomatic v0.38 by removing adapter sequences, ambiguous reads having unknown nucleotides “N” > 5%, and low-quality sequences (reads with more than 10% quality threshold (QV) < 25 phred score) along with a sliding window of 20 bp and a minimum length of 100 bp. High-quality PE reads were stitched into the single-end (SE) reads using fluorescent-amplification-based specific hybridization (FLASH) v1.2.1126with an error rate of 2%, over 98% of read pairs correctly with default parameters. Denoised chimeric sequences through Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2)27and filtered them as per Qualitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME 2)28. Diversity analysis was performed based on observed features; besides the rarefaction curves, Taxonomic classification was performed on the amplicon sequence variants (ASV) with the q2-feature classifier using a pre-trained classifier based on the SILVA database29. Richness estimators, Chao1, and abundance-based coverage estimate (ACE), along with diversity metrics (α-diversity: Shannon’s index, Simpson index, Simpson reciprocal) were generated using QIIME and R based on normalized data.

The functional prediction was performed using the Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) v1.2.10, a manually constructed database, which can determine the functions capable of governing ecological and metabolic functional profiles based on a database compiled from peer-reviewed literature and identify corresponding putative strains by utilizing the OTU (operational taxonomic unit) table generated from high-throughput sequencing12. It uses a Python script to match the OTUs table to the FAPROTAX database of functional annotations and provides the functional profiles specifically for marine and lake biogeochemical cycles30.

Although a few limitations are associated with the FAPROTAX database; it only includes cultured members of the strains. Secondly, it also assumes that if a cultured member of a taxon can perform any function, all the members (cultured and non-cultured) can perform the same function31.

Even after considering the above shortcomings, several recent studies from diverse domains have used the FAPROTAX database to study pathogen communities in polluted rivers32, effects of nutrients on bacterial community structure in surface sediments in Lake system33, metabolic functions of the microbial community in indoor dust of university dormitories34, variation in potential functions in cow manure during its transit in earthworm’s gut35, functional properties of the bacterial community in surface sediment of nutrient-saturated lakes36and many more.

Researchers also use other advanced tools for functional annotations, like the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt 2)37and Tax4Fun10. Our study majorly focuses on biogeochemical cycles, and the FAPROTAX database has functional annotations for major biogeochemical cycles such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur38and to account for the dynamics of biogeochemical functions within lake ecosystems. We considered FAPROTAX as it was a preliminary study, and we needed to screen a large number of samples (n= 12) and being a cost-effective alternative to shotgun sequencing (functional metagenomics)12other, researchers also prefer the putative functional profiles prediction approach over sequence homology-based genomic prediction approaches30,31.

The sediment physico-chemical data in triplicate was obtained for all 19 sites from LP, and the mean value was calculated for each composite group’s parameters. One-way analysis of variance with Fisher posthoc pair-wise comparison was applied at a 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05) to determine significant differences within circumlimnal groups and seasons in Minitab 21.2. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine the response of biogeochemical functional traits to sediment physico-chemical characteristics.

Here, Fig.2A presents physico-chemical analyses of sediment samples, with the upper row showing seasonal variations (means across circumlimnal conditions) and the lower row comparing circumlimnal variations (means across seasons). Sediment pH was alkaline during PR and PM seasons but significantly decreased (p < 0.01) to near neutrality during the MO season. ORP was significantly higher (p < 0.001) during PR and PM seasons, indicating oxidizing conditions, while the MO season showed lower ORP, suggesting a reducing environment. Notably, the SM content was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated during the PR season compared to the MO season. Considering the circumlimnal aspect, the PII group (Sisarma river inflow) exhibited a significantly higher SOM content (p < 0.05) than the PIV group (embankment, greater depth). Furthermore, the C/N ratio was significantly higher (p < 0.05) during the MO season than the PR and PM seasons.

The lowercase alphabet represents group labels, and groups that do not share the same letter have significantly different mean values. Fisher-Least Significant Difference (LSD) was applied for pair-wise comparison after one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); PI-PIV represents circumlimnal groups in Lake Pichola while PR, MO and PM represent three seasons. For other abbreviations, refer to the main text.

Sequencing of 12 composite littoral sediment samples across four circumlimnal groups and three seasons yielded 4,511,742 raw paired end (PE) reads. Following adapter and ambiguous read removal (FASTQC v0.12.1), 2,753,986 high quality (HQ) PE reads were retained (Supplementary Fig.S1). These were stitched (FLASH), denoised by chimera filtering, and taxonomically classified. For Lake Pichola (16,349), OTUs were generated, and diversity indices and richness estimates were calculated. Rarefaction curves (Supplementary Fig.S2) indicate optimal sequencing depth and representative bacterial OTUs for the lake sediment.

Within-sample diversity metrics of the microbial community from twelve samples were analyzed post-Illumina sequencing. Good’s coverage (~ 1) indicates that bacterial profiles accurately represent the original communities. Richness estimators (Chao1 and ACE) matched observed features, likely due to few unique features with similar abundance. Figure2B shows within-sample diversity, with the Shannon index considering rare taxa and the Simpson index considering abundance as a function for diversity (0–1, higher value = higher diversity)31; Simpson reciprocal was also calculated, which is the inverse of the Simpson index; it ranges from one to infinity, and a higher value denotes higher diversity. Figure2B (upper row) compares alpha diversity within circumlimnal groups across seasons, and the lower row compares across circumlimnal groups within seasons. The PI group exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) observed features and diversity indices compared to the PII site, while no significant seasonal differences were observed.

PR_PI sample exhibited a distinct bacterial profile (Fig.3), characterized by exceptionally high relative abundances of Patescibacteria (13%) and Planctomycetota (4%), alongside a relatively low Actinobacteriota abundance (2%). Desulfobacterota (6%) displayed a discrete rise in relative abundance within the PR_PII sample along with a low relative abundance of Actinobacteriota (2%). A notable Bacteroidota (24%) dominance was observed in PR_PIII sample rather than Proteobacteria phylum. Likewise, PR_PIV sample had the highest relative abundance for Acidobacteriota (7%) and Verrucomicrobiota (4%). Furthermore, MO_PI was characterized by the highest relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum, while MO_PII (21%) and MO_PIII (17%) shared the highest relative abundance for the Firmicutes phylum. Subsequently, MO_PIII exhibited the highest Actinobacteriota and Acidobacteriota relative abundance (7%), along with the lowest relative abundance for Patescibacteria phylum (1%). Planctomycetota (4%) and Chloroflexi (3%) displayed the highest relative abundance within the MO_PIV sample. Successively, during the PM period, PM_PI was marked by the highest Chloroflexi abundance (8%), while PM_PII was dominated by Bacteroidota (27%) and Firmicutes (21%), with a remarkably lowest Proteobacteria abundance (19%). Similarly, PM_PIII shared the highest Desulfobacterota abundance (6%) and the lowest relative abundance of Chloroflexi, Patescibacteria, Planctomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota phyla. Lastly, PM_PIV showed high Verrucomicrobiota (4%) and low Acidobacteriota (2%). Interestingly, Actinobacteriota abundance was comparatively lowest within all PR season samples, Desulfobacterota phyla had consistently the lowest abundance during the MO season, while Planctomycetota phyla had the lowest relative abundance during the PM season.

Comparison of bacterial community composition at phylum level based on the relative abundance of the first ten abundant phyla within twelve samples from Lake Pichola. Here, PR, MO, and PM represent three seasons, and PI_PIV represents four circumlimnal groups from Lake Pichola.

The input feature table for LP had 16,349 OTU records. Using FAPROTAX database with 92 functional groups12, 3,809 records (23.29%) were assigned to 73 functional groups in LP, and was consistent with recent findings35. Chemoheterotrophy was the dominant function in LP, followed by aerobic chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, animal parasites and symbionts, respiration of sulfur compounds, sulfate respiration, nitrate reduction, and nitrogen respiration (Supplementary Fig.S3), aligning with previous studies39,40. For convenience, all the FAPROTAX functions are categorized into seven broad function classes (Fig.4), but some functions associated with one class might be associated with other classes as well. One-way ANOVA followed by Fischer LSD post hoc test was used to assess significant differences in OTUs associated with each function, comparing either circumlimnal conditions (accounting for seasonal variability) or seasonal variations (accounting for circumlimnal variability).

Pair-wise comparison of variability from seasonal and circumlimnal factors within the available FAPROTAX ecological and metabolic functions for composite grouped samples (n = 12) of Lake Pichola, represented through a polar heatmap with color representing z-score based on normalization across samples. Hierarchical clustering generated 12 clusters for functions and 9 for samples in Lake Pichola. One-way analysis of variance was applied followed by the Fisher LSD post hoc test with appropriate normality and homogeneity checks; wherever required, and the box-cox transformation was applied. The significant differences were represented by group labels, where lowercase and uppercase labels separated by “;” represent three seasons (PR, MO, and PM) respectively separated by “,” and 4 circumlimnal groups (PI, PII, PIII, and PIV) for Lake Pichola. Superscript annotations on group labels represent * is p < 0.05, ** is p < 0.01, *** is p < 0.001, and ns is not significant. The diamond-shaped label with numbers represents the respective function classes as per the legend at the bottom-left part of the plot.

Looking at the carbon cycling function class, out of the 8 carbon cycle functions at the OTU level (Fig.4), methanogenesis, methanogenesis by CO2reduction with H2, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, methanogenesis by reduction of methyl compounds with H2, methanol oxidation, and methanotrophy do not differ significantly. However, methanogenesis using formate had significantly higher OTUs in the PI group (p < 0.05) compared to PII and PIV, and also during the PR season (p < 0.05) compared to the PM season. In the case of methylotrophy as well, there was no seasonal significant difference in methylotrophic OTUs, but PIV has significantly higher (p < 0.05) methylotrophic bacteria OTUs than PIII and PII groups. Clustering of OTUs for carbon cycle functions like methanogenesis, methanogenesis by CO2reduction with H2, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, methanogenesis by reduction of methyl compounds with H2, methanogenesis using formate-associated OTUs were higher in the PI group during the PR period. Likewise, methanol oxidation OTUs were also prevalent in the PM season within the PI group. Methylotrophy and methanotrophy functions are clustered; their corresponding OTUs were higher in the MO season. OTU features for putative functions like acetoclastic methanogenesis and methanogenesis through disproportionation of methyl groups are absent in Lake Pichola.

Statistical analysis revealed distinct seasonal and circumlimnal patterns in the distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with 14 nitrogen cycling functions (Fig.4). Notably, ureolysis, nitrogen respiration, and nitrate respiration exhibited no significant differences. However, nitrogen fixation-associated OTUs were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) during the PM season compared to the MO season. From seasonal purview, the denitrification function (nitrate and nitrite) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the PM season than in the PR and MO seasons, whereas from the circumlimnal prospect, the PI group had significantly higher (p < 0.05) denitrification OTUs than the PIII and PIV groups. Conversely, nitrous oxide denitrification and anammox functions had no associated OTUs in LP. Looking at oxidative processes in N cycling, aerobic nitrite oxidation-associated OTUs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the PR season and at the PIV site group highlighting the favorable conditions for the process. In the PM season, aerobic ammonia oxidation and nitrification-associated OTUs were significantly lower (p < 0.01), indicating the possible unfavorable state. The clustering of these functions further supports this observation, with higher Z score values for the above functions during the PR period. Likewise, for reductive processes like nitrite/nitrate ammonification, the interaction of seasonal and circumlimnal conditions could govern these functions. Statistically, nitrite ammonification-associated OTUs were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the MO season but significantly higher (p < 0.05) at the PIV site group. On the other hand, nitrate ammonification-associated OTUs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the PM season and significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the PIII group. Further, nitrite respiration-associated OTUs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the PI group than PII group within the MO season. Nitrate reduction OTUs were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the PR season, with no significant circumlimnal differences. Conversely, ammonification clustering (nitrite and nitrate) was prevalent during the PR and PM seasons. Ureolysis, nitrogen respiration, nitrate respiration, and nitrite respiration functions clustered together and were substantially prevalent during the MO and PM periods. Finally, nitrite and nitrate denitrification, representing overall denitrification, were prevalent in the PM season.

Nine putative sulphur cycling functions were assigned to OTUs in LP (Fig.4), broadly categorized as respiration and dark oxidation of sulfur compounds. Beginning with reduction functions, statistically, sulfate respiration function and associated OTUs show no seasonal significant difference, but the PIII group has significantly higher (p < 0.01) assigned OTUs than the PIV and PII groups. Sulfite respiration and assigned OTUs also do not show any seasonal significant differences, but here again, the circumlimnal group PIII has significantly higher (p < 0.05) associated OTUs than the PIV group. In contrast, for the sulfur respiration, no statistically significant differences were observed for either of the factors. Out of all the respiration functions, only thiosulfate respiration associated OTUs are significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the PM season, at circumlimnal groups PII and PIII (p < 0.05). Further, in the case of oxidation functions, OTUs associated with dark thiosulfate oxidation are significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the PR season as compared to MO and PM seasons, but no significant differences were observed in associated OTUs from circumlimnal purview. Statistically, for the dark sulfur oxidation function, the assigned OTU features are significantly lower (p < 0.05) within the MO season, but not significant within the circumlimnal aspect. Similarly, for dark sulfide oxidation, the assigned OTUs to the function are significantly higher during the PR period than during MO and PM seasons, with non-significant differences existing for circumlimnal groups. Dark sulfite oxidation function was not associated with any OTUs in LP. As per the clustering, it can be inferred that all the oxidative processes for sulphur cycling were clustered together, indicating the resemblance in functioning and governing factors. Instead, the functions categorized under respiration of sulfur compounds are all part of distinct clusters, except sulfur respiration and thiosulfate respiration.

For clarity, four FAPROTAX functions (methanogenesis, methanotrophy, methylotrophy, and methanol oxidation) were grouped under carbon cycling (Fig.5). Methanogenesis comprised six sub-categories (methanogenesis using formate, methanogenesis by CO2reduction with H2, methanogenesis by reduction of methyl compounds with H2, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, methanogenesis by disproportionation of methyl groups, and acetoclastic methanogenesis), with the last two methanogenesis sub-categories absent in Lake Pichola. In total, 272 putative bacteria/archaea were associated with carbon cycling in LP (Fig.5), contributing 27.21% to methanogenesis, 27.94% to methanotrophy, 38.66% (highest) to methylotrophy, and 6.25% (lowest) to methanol oxidation (Supplementary TableS1). Seasonally, functional contributions to carbon cycling were relatively higher within the PI and PIII groups, in the PR season, replaced by PIV and PI groups during the MO period, ultimately shifting to the PIV and PII groups in the PM season. From a circumlimnal aspect, the PI group follows the order (PR > MO > PM), PII (PM > PR > MO), PIII (PR > MO ~ PM), and PIV (MO > PM > PR) for functional contribution to carbon cycling. Within the carbon cycling function class, methanogenesis involved fourteen types of putative bacteria/archaea (family-species level) across all twelve LP samples. Two of them (Methanomassiliicoccus sp.and the member from the Methanomassiliicoccaceae family) were contributing to methylotrophy function as well so their counts appear double in Fig.5. Assuming that they might equally contribute to both functions, their counts will be considered as half. Looking into the sub-categories of methanogenesis function and associated bacteria, based on the pathway (Fig.5), were: methanogenesis using formate (Methanospirillum sp.); CO2reduction with H2(Methanobacterium sp.,Methanocorpusculum sp.,Methanolinea sp.,Methanoregula sp.,Methanospirillum sp.,Methanosarcina sp., and a Methanomicrobiales family member); reduction of methyl compounds with H2(Methanomonassiliicoccus sp.and a Methanomonassiliicoccaceae member); hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Methanobacterium sp.,Methanocorpusculum sp.,Methanolinea sp.,Methanoregula sp.,Methanosphaerula sp.,Methanospirillum sp.,Methanosarcina sp.,Methanomonassiliicoccus sp., and members from families Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanomonassiliicoccaceae). Looking into other functions; methanotrophy and methanol oxidation are distinct subsets of methylotrophy function. Methylotrophs encompass methanotrophs, methanol oxidizers, and methylotrophic methanogens utilizing single-carbon sources other than methane and methanol. Eighteen types of putative methanotrophs and twenty four methylotrophs with their samplewise contributions (Supplementary Table1), across all twelve LP samples, are shown in Fig.5.

The bacterium names have a prefix separated by a “_” sign for designating taxonomic level where ‘f’ stands for family, ‘g’ for genus, and ‘s’ for species name.

Conveniently for the nitrogen cycle, we considered the broad seven FAPROTAX functions (nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, nitrogen respiration, nitrate reduction, and ureolysis) in the nitrogen cycling function class (Fig.4). Around 480 putative bacteria were associated with these functions across all twelve LP samples (Fig.6). Nitrate reduction (35%) had the highest overall contribution, followed by nitrogen respiration (20.63%), nitrification (20.42%), nitrogen fixation (10.42%), and ureolysis (9.79%). Denitrification and ammonification each contributed the lowest (1.88%) (Supplementary TableS2). Seasonally, PR and MO seasons showed relatively higher contributions in PI and PIV groups, while the PM season showed higher contributions in PIV and PIII groups. From the circumlimnal perspective, in the PI group, contribution to nitrogen cycling in different seasons follows the order MO > PR > PM, for PII (PM > MO > PR), PIII (PM > MO > PR), lastly, for the PIV group, the order is PM > MO > PR, indicating the distinct patterns at the PI group. The nitrogen fixation function involved approximately sixteen distinct OTUs across all LP samples, with some potentially contributing to nitrogen respiration (2.50%), nitrate reduction (2.3%), ammonification (0.84%), and ureolysis (1.46%). Nitrification involved around fifteen putative bacteria (Fig.6), includingNitrosomonas nitrosa(0.21%), which also performs ureolysis. There are two sub-categories within nitrification: aerobic ammonia oxidation (involving all listed nitrifiers) and aerobic nitrite oxidation (onlyCandidatus Nitrotoga sp.). Subsequently, ammonification in LP involved around five bacteria (Fig.6).Clostridium butyricum, also a nitrogen-fixer, contributed to both nitrogen fixation and ammonification in certain samples (PR_PIII, PR_PIV, PM_PI, and PM_PIV) with 0.21% contribution within each.Lactobacillus brevis(MO_PII only) was an ammonifier not associated with nitrate reduction, unlike other ammonifiers (linked to both nitrogen respiration and nitrate reduction).Ammonification is an aggregate of nitrate ammonification (Sulfurospirilllum arsenophillum,Desulfovibrio vulgaris, andAnaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, also capable of nitrite ammonification) and nitrite ammonification (Lactobacillus brevisandClostridium butyricum). Additionally, within a few samples (PR_PI, PR_PII, MO_PIII, MO_PIV, and PM_PIII), ammonification-associated putative bacteria were absent. Four denitrifiers were associated with all LP samples (Supplementary TableS2), all are also involved in nitrogen respiration and nitrate reduction, and absent in certain samples (PR_PI, PR_PII, PR_PIV, and PM_PIII) of LP (Fig.6). Within denitrification (nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide), all putative denitrifiers performed nitrate and nitrite denitrification, but none performed nitrous oxide denitrification (Fig.6). Further, twenty-five OTUs (Fig.6) are associated within the nitrogen respiration function, which includes the nitrate-reducing and the nitrite ammonifying bacteria. Some are also linked to nitrogen fixation (12%), denitrification (12%), and ammonification (20%). Subsequently, nitrate reduction involved around forty-one bacteria, exclusively fifteen (Supplementary TableS2), while others overlapping with nitrogen respiration (twenty-five), ammonification (D. vulgaris,A. dehalogenans, andS. arsenophilum), denitrification (Paracoccus sp.,Zoogloea sp., andD. multivorans), and nitrogen fixation (Azospira sp.,Magnetospirillum sp., andD. tiedjei). Ureolysis involved around fifteen distinct bacteria (Fig.6), exclusively nine, while the rest also involved in nitrate reduction (B. funiculusandS. thalpophilum), nitrification (N. nitrosa), and nitrogen fixation (Azotobacter sp.,Azospirillum sp., andMesorhizobium sp.).

The bacterium names have a prefix separated by a “_” sign for designating taxonomic level where ‘f’ stands for family, ‘g’ for genus, and ‘s’ for species name.

For the sulphur cycle, considering seven FAPROTAX functions (sulfate respiration, sulfur respiration, sulfite respiration, thiosulfate respiration, dark sulfide oxidation, dark sulfur oxidation, and dark thiosulfate oxidation) (Fig.4), are broadly included under two major classes (respiration of sulfur compounds and dark oxidation of sulfur compounds), but to prevent repetition, they were excluded from the text and figures (Fig.7). Around 451 putative bacteria were associated with these functions across all twelve LP samples. Sulfate respiration (63.86%) had the highest contribution, followed by thiosulfate respiration (15.3%), dark sulfide oxidation (7.1%), sulfite respiration (6.43%), and dark thiosulfate oxidation (1.77%). Dark sulfur oxidation had the lowest contribution (0.89%) (Supplementary TableS3). Seasonally, the PR season showed higher sulphur cycling contributions at PI and PIII, and the MO and PM seasons at PIII and PIV. Circumlimnally, PI and PII groups followed the order PR > PM > MO, PIII followed PR > PM = MO, and PIV followed PM > MO > PR. Sulfate respiration involved twenty-four distinct OTUs (Fig.7), withDesulfobulbus sp.(3.77%),D. biactus(0.22%), andD. multivorans(0.22%) also contributing to sulfite respiration, whereasDesulforhopalus sp.(2.22%),D. vulgaris(0.22%), andD. tiedjei(0.22%) also contributing to thiosulfate respiration (Supplementary TableS3). Sulfur respiration involved around five OTUs, withS. arsenophilum(0.44%) also associated with thiosulfate respiration. Sulfite respiration included four bacteria already linked to sulfate respiration (Fig.7). Thiosulfate respiration involved around six bacteria (Fig.7; Supplementary TableS3). Dark oxidation of sulfur compounds involved around four bacteria, withThiobacillus sp.(6.21%) being the major contributor to dark sulfide oxidation, followed byMagnetovibrio sp.(0.89%), which also contributed to dark thiosulfate oxidation along withS. variabilis(0.89%), which also contributed to dark sulfur oxidation (0.89%).

RDA was employed to assess variability in FAPROTAX putative functions related to C, N, and S biogeochemical cycling based on sediment physico-chemical parameters in twelve LP samples. The triplots (Fig.8) illustrate the influence of seasonal and circumlimnal factors on the inertia between sediment characteristics and biogeochemical functions. Figure8a,c,e on the left, depicts within seasonal variability across four circumlimnal groups, while the Fig.8b,d,f represents variability within the circumlimnal groups based on the three seasons for the littoral sediment characteristics and biogeochemical functions.

Redundancy analysis (RDA) based estimation of the association between sediment physico-chemical characteristics and OTU counts associated with FAPROTAX putative function specifically explaining the variability of functions associated with biogeochemical cycling of carbon (a) & (b), nitrogen (c) & (d), and sulphur (e) & (f) from Lake Pichola. Plots on the left side depict seasonal variability, while on the right represent variability among circumlimnal groups. The sample label in different colors indicates three seasons PR (Red), MO (Green), and PM (Purple), whereas dashed vectors with indigo labels represent FAPROTAX functions and solid black vectors represent sediment physico-chemical parameters. Higher magnitudes and closer distances of vectors represent a higher association.

RDA for carbon cycling in Lake Pichola yielded four components (78.63% cumulative inertia). C-RDA I (51.14%) showed positive loadings for methanotrophy (0.65) and methylotrophy (0.64), negatively correlated with SOM (-0.44), ORP (-0.378), SM (-0.34), and pH (-0.29). Methanogenesis (0.49) in C-RDA II (16.68%) was negatively correlated with BD (-0.43) and C/N ratio (-0.35), and positively with ORP (0.32), TN (0.23), and SOM (0.22). Methanol oxidation (0.39) in C-RDA III (10.80%) was positively correlated with ORP (0.417), pH (0.414), and SM (0.32), and negatively with BD (-0.39) and C/N ratio (-0.28).

RDA for nitrogen cycling generated five components (52.42% cumulative inertia). N-RDA I (20.51%) showed positive loadings for nitrogen fixation (0.43), nitrate ammonification (0.39), nitrate reduction (0.29), and nitrogen respiration (0.20), negatively correlated with SOM (-0.530), TC (-0.413), SM (-0.302), and C/N (-0.25), and positively with ORP (0.308) and BD (0.293). N-RDA II (15.13%) showed positive loading for nitrite ammonification (0.53), correlated positively with ORP (0.65) and SM (0.60), and negatively with C/N ratio (-0.35) and SOM (-0.34). N-RDA III (10.20%) showed positive loadings for nitrification (0.35) and nitrate reduction (0.34), correlated positively with C/N (0.80) and BD (0.52), and negatively with pH (-0.92), ORP (-0.46), and SM (-0.31). N-RDA IV (3.93%) showed positive loadings for nitrogen fixation and ureolysis, negatively correlated with TC (-0.65), TN (-0.59), and SOM (-0.34), and positively with BD (0.30). N-RDA V (2.65%) showed a negative loading for nitrogen respiration and a positive loading for denitrification, correlated positively with C/N ratio (0.32), TC (0.27), BD (0.23), and pH (0.18), and negatively with SOM (-0.48).

RDA for sulphur cycling in LP sediments yielded three components (68.16% cumulative inertia). S-RDA I (42.69%) showed higher positive loadings for dark thiosulfate oxidation (0.61), dark sulfide oxidation (0.47), dark oxidation of sulfur compounds (0.46), dark sulfur oxidation (0.45), and sulfate respiration (0.23), and higher negative loadings for thiosulfate respiration (-0.40), sulfur respiration (-0.33), and respiration of sulfur compounds (-0.25), explained by positive loadings for SM (0.56), ORP (0.54), TN (0.30), TC (0.28) and negative loading for BD (-0.39). S-RDA II (15.00%) showed higher positive loadings for sulfate respiration (0.54), respiration of sulfur compounds (0.26), and sulfite respiration (0.22), explained by positive loadings for TN (0.72), TC (0.43), and SM (0.26), and negative loading for BD (-0.28). S-RDA III (10.47%) showed higher positive loadings for thiosulfate respiration (0.28) and respiration of sulfur compounds (0.26), and a negative loading for sulfur respiration (-0.30), explained by positive loadings for pH (0.85), ORP (0.68), and SM (0.23) and negative loadings for C/N ratio (-0.43) and SOM (-0.33).

Physico-chemical characteristics and their seasonal and circumlimnal variability had crucial role in influencing microbial abundance and diversity41. pH is an important parameter that governs the abundance and diversity of microbes42. Onsite pH estimation indicated neutral to weakly alkaline conditions. Sediment characteristics (except SOM) had no significant differences based on circumlimnal conditions, seasonal variations were significant, with pH lower (near neutral) during the MO season in Lake Pichola, potentially due to rainfall dilution43and organic load from stream runoffs leading to organic acid production44; alternatively, the addition of suspended matter might limit photosynthetic activity in the water column and carbon dioxide removal causes pH shifts45. ORP, a redox state indicator, had no significant differences among circumlimnal groups, but oxidizing conditions in PR and PM seasons significantly dropped during the MO season, possibly due to organic load influx from monsoon runoff and microbial decomposition46. BD, influenced by SM, SOM, and fine particulates, was below 1 g/cm3in LP across seasons and groups, likely due to fine silt and clay and biogenic siliceous diatomaceous material47, supported by the inverse relation between SM and BD in most groups and seasons. Significantly higher SM in the PR season is likely due to abundant finer fractions retaining excess moisture. Allochthonous SOM was significantly higher at PII than PIV, possibly from upstream organic matter input at PII during the MO season from agricultural and sewage discharges via the Sisarma River; autochthonous SOM production occurred at outflow sites PI and PIII later in the PR season. TC content showed the highest seasonal variability in the PII group and the lowest in the PIV group, with the relatively highest TC in the PR season, gradually reducing in MO and reaching the lowest in PM, a trend mirrored by SOM, suggesting a major organic carbon contribution. TN showed no significant seasonal or inter-group differences in Lake Pichola, but sites PII and PI had substantially higher TN levels from agricultural runoff and untreated sewage near the Sisarma River catchment. Anthropogenic inputs at PI from densely populated areas and sewage seepage might contribute to TN concentration in PR season with reduced water levels48. The MO season in LP had a significantly higher C/N ratio, with substantially higher values at PI and PIII sites, indicating organic-rich load transport from the PII group towards the two outflows. Groups PII and PIV had relatively lower C/N ratios, significantly lower in PR and PM seasons, suggesting TN retention and TC removal within Lake Pichola.

Observed features (OTUs) displayed intra-lake variability, with significantly higher mean values at the PI group after accounting for annual seasonal changes. The Shannon index indicated substantially higher species richness at PI, while Simpson reciprocal values showed significant intra-lake diversity differences due to variations in species evenness between the PI and PII groups. This aligns with global studies on anthropogenically influenced freshwater lakes, where nutrient enrichment and pollution tend to increase bacterial diversity by creating diverse ecological niches49. Seasonally, considering the entire lake, significantly higher OTUs were present in the PR season at LP. Furthermore, the Shannon index revealed intra-season differences in the MO season, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in LP, as seasonal changes in temperature and nutrient levels are key drivers of bacterial community structure in lakes and can significantly affect OTU richness and diversity50,51.

Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes abundance exhibit a stronger seasonal influence than circumlimnal differences. Although less seasonally variable in tropical aquatic ecosystems, both are influenced by monsoon cycles and agricultural runoff52, contrasting with temperate regions showing their higher abundance in summer and autumn due to increased organic matter and primary productivity53. Other studies on Lake Erie (USA), Lake Geneva (Switzerland), and Lake Taihu (China) have also reported seasonal variation in Proteobacteria dominance, particularly in regions with high nutrient availability and organic matter inflow54. Likewise, Bacteriodota occurs in wastewater-impacted lakes, eutrophic reservoirs, and post-monsoon floodplains; conversely, firmicutes, occur under a hypoxic sedimentary environment55. Firmicutes, having the ability of spore formation, can survive even in extremely harsh conditions, suggesting an adaptive response to seasonal shifts, perhaps could ferment a wide range of organic compounds like butyrate and acetate56. Patescibacteria is widely detected in deep subsurface environments and oligotrophic lakes like Lake Baikal (Russia), Lake Michigan (USA), and Lake Birwa (Japan), and also among the freshwater sediments57. They are metabolically streamlined and lack key biosynthetic pathways, mostly dependent on host bacteria or symbiotic association for survival but have been linked to fermentation-based metabolism and interactions with biogeochemical cycling58. The significantly higher abundance of Patescibacteria in Lake Pichola at the PI site during the PR season is possibly due to the shallow water regime, low turbulence, and organic matter accumulation. Although seasonal variations are less studied in this phylum, their higher abundance might correlate with the host activity level59. Chloroflexi, prevalent in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), freshwater, and marine sediments with notably high organic matter inputs and includes photoheterotrophic, chemoheterotrophic, and anaerobic bacteria with crucial roles like organic matter degradation, nitrogen removal, and hydrogen metabolism60. Their relatively higher abundance at the PI group is explained by the availability of organic matter and nutrients in a low-energy environment and low oxygen availability, possibly from domestic sewage pollution at this site, where they could assist in remineralizing organic matter61. Both, Actinobacteriota and Acidobacteriota abundance were influenced by season rather than circumlimnal conditions, having a moderate abundance, indicating their consistent presence. Actinobacteriota is commonly prevalent in rhizospheric sediments of aquatic plants. As per a study on the Heihe River Basin in China, they play a crucial role in nitrogen cycling and organic matter degradation62. Similarly, Acidobacteriota aids in carbon cycling within the aquatic ecosystems through their ability to utilize diverse carbon sources, including xylan and chitin, acting as key players in organic matter decomposition63. Their presence is often associated with healthy microbial communities as they participate in nutrient cycling and contribute to ecosystem stability and resilience64. Desulfobacterota, formerly (Deltaproteobacteria), is a group of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) commonly found in marine sediments, freshwater wetlands, and tidal flats. They prefer anaerobic environments with sulfate availability, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, hot springs, and coastal sediments, and their distribution is influenced by environmental factors such as sulfate concentration, organic carbon availability, and redox conditions65. Desulfobacterota performs aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and sulfate reduction through symbiotic association with fermenting microbes, utilizing the molecular hydrogen as a fermentation product for sulfate reduction and nitrate reduction, mitigating nitrate reduction in coastal and mangrove ecosystems. In peatlands and freshwater wetlands, they assist with carbon mineralization and methane mitigation by competing with methanogenic archaea for substrates like acetate and hydrogen, limiting methane emissions66. Verrucomicriobiota usually thrive in organic-rich freshwater and marine environments, where they participate in organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling67; here, they showed significantly higher abundance in the PIV group in LP, suggesting niche preference. Planctomycetota, despite with lower abundance in LP, is ecologically important in lakes for its involvement in the degradation of complex organic materials, performing anaerobic processes like fermentation, sulfur reduction, and denitrification68. Additionally, they can thrive in different habitats, including sediments, water columns, and algal mats, exhibiting higher adaptability and survival strategies across different chemical gradients69.

Lake Pichola, considering carbon cycling putative functions, exhibited a dominance of methylotrophic OTUs, with nearly equal methanogen and methanotroph abundance, and the lowest representation of methanol oxidizers, likely due to high substrate availability in its hypertrophic state70. Methylotrophic bacteria are comparatively abundant in Lake Pichola and can oxidize simpler single-carbon compounds. Methanotrophs, which are a type of methylotroph71, are more abundant in LP as compared to methanol oxidizing bacteria, particularly Type I rather than Type II methanotrophs. It implies that the sediment has high oxygen levels and methanotrophs are more responsive to even lower methane concentrations72. The methanotrophic communities in the lake are typically dominated by gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs (Methylococcales order) and substantially lower alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs (Type II)73. LP has two distinct genera of Type II methanotrophs (Methylocella sp.andMethylocystis sp.), possibly as hypertrophic conditions may provide abundant substrates for methanogenesis, leading to increased methane production. This, in turn, supports a higher abundance of Type II methanotrophs74, as compared to oligotrophic lakes73. C-RDA I had high positive loading for methanotrophy (0.65) for MO_PIV sample, followed by PM_PIV and MO_PI. In MO_PIV sample, the abundant methanotrophs wasMethylobacter sp.(1.84%). Being a methanotroph, it could share its methane-derived oxidized carbon produced in PR season with methylotrophs likeMethylotenera sp.(MO_PIV and PM_PIV) during MO and PM seasons for further oxidation, which does not require the cell to cell transfer but is aided by nitrate in eutrophic lakes75. Other associated methanotrophs with the MO_PIV sample wereMethylomicrobium sp.(1.47%), an obligatory methanotroph and members from the family Methylomonadaceae (1.10%). The environmental factors based on C-RDA I indicates the combination of relatively lower ORP and lower moisture content during the MO season in LP which likely creates more favorable micro-oxic conditions and better gas exchange within the upper sediment, allowing methanotrophs to access both methane (from deeper anoxic layers) and oxygen (from the water column/diffusion) more effectively. The relatively lower organic matter might reduce extreme anoxia and competition, while the slightly alkaline pH is within the preferred range for many methanotrophic species. This suite of conditions in MO_PIV and PM_PIV samples possibly shifts the balance, favoring methane consumption over methane production or other anaerobic processes at the sediment–water interface. In the MO_PI sample, as well, there are additional abundant OTUs likeMethylomonas sp.along withMethylomicrobium sp., both being Type I methanotroph along withCrenothrix sp.,which is although associated with manganese and iron oxidation, but here it is oxidizing methane, acting as a connecting link between these cycles.

Considering the C-RDA II with high positive loading for Methanogenesis (0.49), the combination of high organic matter, relatively lower bulk density, a C/N ratio that supports an active anaerobic food web, and ORP conditions indicative of active anoxic micro-niches collectively created highly favorable conditions for the growth and activity of diverse methanogenic archaea, leading to their relatively higher abundance in the samples (PR_PI, PM_PI, PM_PII, and PR_PIV). Particularly PR_PI sample has the possible dominance of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway in LP, like other eutrophic lakes76, based on the abundance ofMethanobacterium sp.(1.10%) andMethanospirillum sp.(0.74%), which is also linked with CO2reduction by H2and methanogenesis using the formate pathway. Additionally, the members of Methanomassillicoccaceae are also abundant (0.74%) in PR_PIV and are methylotrophic methanogens, capable of reducing methyl compounds with H2and producing methane. They consume non-competitive methylated substrates like methanol and methylamines when substrate limitation constricts the hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis pathways77. This is evident in (Fig.4) where no putative OTUs were associated with these functions, possibly due to the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

The methanol oxidation process, a part of the broader methylotrophy pathway for one-carbon compounds, utilizes methanol produced during CH4oxidation through methanotrophs and converts it to formaldehyde or further oxidize it to formate and CO2with the aid of enzymes like methanol dehydrogenases, phenazine methosulphate-dependent pteridine-type enzyme78. Considering the C-RDA III, the methanol oxidation function had positive loading (0.39), the reduced oxidation potential, relatively lower alkaline pH, higher BD and severe nitrogen limitation (high C/N) had selectively favoured the proliferation ofMethylobacillus sp.and Methylophilaceae during MO season at PI site, whereas the combined effect of more oxic, alkaline, moist, and less compacted sediment with a favorable C/N ratio, likely created an optimal niche forParacoccus sp.during PM season, leading to its higher abundance and association with methanol oxidation, demonstrating the influence of environmental parameters driving shifts in the functional composition of the methanol-oxidizing community. Interestingly, the Methylophilaceae andParacoccus sp.are both capable of denitrification, but seasonal changes from MO to PM have shifted the community adapted to anaerobic denitrification in MO to aerobic denitrification in the PM season, indicating the ecosystem’s resilience and continuous removal of nitrogen.

Looking at the nitrogen cycle, N-RDA I with high positive loading for the nitrogen fixation and the nitrate ammonification-associated OTUs. Sediment characteristics at the PM_PIII site, a specific combination of moderately lower organic matter and moisture, a favorable C/N ratio, and crucially, microoxic conditions (higher ORP), collectively created an environment that selectively promoted the abundance ofAzospirillum sp.andMagnetospirillum sp., enabling their key role in nitrogen fixation within the hypertrophic lake.Magnetospirillum sp.abundance suggests the presence of dissolved iron, which is often released from the sediments during reducing conditions, and has been reported to biomineralize magnetite (Fe3O4) through magnetosome formation79aided by diazotrophs likeAzospirillum sp., ensuring nutrient availability. Likewise, at the PII site, relatively higher SOM and BD than the PM_PIII sample, with an abundance of symbionts and cyanobacteria likeNostoc sp.PCC-7107 could be attributed to the presence of algal blooms. In PR_PIBradyrhizobium sp.is primarily an abundant diazotroph and is also a phosphate mineralizing bacteria (PMB) that exhibit symbiotic association with aquatic plants and algae. Nitrate ammonifiers associated with N-RDA I include OTUsAnaeromyxobacter dehalogenans(PM_PI and PM_PII), along withDesulfovibrio vulgaris(MO_PI) andSulfurospirillum arsenophilum(PM_PIV).Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenansis present only in PM season samples and is capable of both reduction of nitrate to ammonium and nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas, even without the typical nitrite reductase genes (nirS andnirK) by a combination of biotic and abiotic reactions, particularly in the presence of Iron through chemodenitrification, highlighting the bacterium’s ability to contribute to N loss in the environment with Iron abundance80. Additionally,S. arsenophilumcould thrive in environments with lower hydrogen concentrations and perform respiration by using arsenate (As(V)) as a terminal electron acceptor similar to those of denitrifiers or Fe (III) reducers, providing a competitive advantage over other anaerobic respirators81, indicating its capacity to modulate microbial processes like sulphur and iron cycling, influencing geochemistry of lake sediments82. Similarly, another sulfate reducer,D. vulgaris, is also associated with ammonification in LP that thrives in environments with heavy metal contamination83as well as facilitating the decomposition of organic compounds along with sulfate reduction even in the presence of oxygen84. Although all nitrate ammonifiers are also associated with nitrite ammonification exceptLactobacillus brevis(MO_PII), a fermenter that degrades organic matter and could indirectly reduce nitrite only, andClostridium butyricum(PM_PIV, PM_PI, PR_PIII and PR_PIV), primarily associated with nitrogen fixation. The abundance ofC. butyricumin PR and PM season is explained by N-RDA II with a specific balance of ORP (indicating a suitable redox environment), high moisture, and a favorable C/N and SOM supporting its metabolism, leading to significant nitrite ammonification. On the other hand, in the MO season, the significantly lower ORP in the monsoon season might be too extreme for the optimal activity ofClostridium butyricumfor nitrite ammonification. The overall lower ORP and potentially less bioavailable SOM could reduce the overall capacity for efficient nitrite ammonification, leading to a shift in the dominant community member that can still perform the function, even if to a lesser extent. N-RDA III explains the abundance of nitrifiers and nitrate reducers, which are primarily explained by the C/N ratio and ORP. Major contributors to nitrification in LP wereMND1,Ellin6067, andmle1-7.MND1 abundance (PR_PI, PR_PIV and MO_PIII) is dependent on relatively higher C/N as compared to PR_PIII and PM_PIV samples withEllin6067 abundance.MND1 presence indicates active organic matter turnover, particularly degrading organic matter and release of methanol and methylamines during decomposition85; being a nitrifier,MND1 utilizes ammonia derived from methylamine degradation for nitrification reflecting functional interconnection86.Ellin6067, a member of Acidobacteria, often found in terrestrial soils, might be transported to lakes through runoff and erosion processes, explaining their abundance in the littoral zone64. Whereasmle1-7 apart from nitrification, is also involved in the degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), particularly recalcitrant compounds, and their abundance can reflect the response of lakes to anthropogenic stress and natural environmental variations87.Nitrosomonas sp.,along withN. nitrosaandN. communis,are abundant in LP and are a part of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) that convert ammonia to nitrite88, and they might compete for ammonia with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)89. These species are indicators of nutrient pollution, particularly in eutrophic lakes with excessive nitrogen inputs (fertilizers and sewage), promoting ammonia accumulation90.Nitrospira sp.is also present in LP, which belongs to nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and converts nitrite to nitrate, but its lower abundance is possibly influenced either by its competitive dynamics with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes91that are relatively abundant in LP or, the suppression by high pollutant levels92. In case of nitrate reduction associated OTUs too, the relatively higher C/N value and ORP possibly influence the abundance ofThauera sp.at MO_PI. Studies have reportedThauera sp.as a core member of the microbial community involved in denitrification, is highly efficient in nitrogen removal as compared to other well-known denitrifiers, specifically in mixotrophic systems where both sulfur autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers are present93. In systems coupling partial denitrification with the anammox process,Thauera sp.plays a crucial role in nitrate reduction primarily through activatingnapA/B/C genes involved in the nitrate reduction process94. In PR_PI, PM_PIII, and PM_PIV samples,Ferribacterium sp.is a dominant nitrate reducer, and its abundance is primarily influenced by a relatively low C/N ratio and high positive ORP. Being an obligate anaerobe, it exists in microaerophilic environments, and few strains can reduce metals like Iron, Manganese, and Zinc95. Relatively lower ORP and higher C/N ratio influence the abundance ofRubrobacter sp.(MO_PIII and PIV). Belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum, they show resilience against extreme environmental conditions like high temperatures, desiccation, and radiation, typically present in arid environments with high alkalinity and salinity96. It also possesses the ability to tolerate oxidative stress and higher concentrations of metals like iron and copper97.A. butzleriis abundant in LP and is commonly found in water systems contaminated with faecal matter, suggesting the presence of sewage or animal waste; its abundance may indicate poor water quality and inadequate sanitation in or around the lake98,99. Being a potential enteric pathogen, it often harbors virulence genes and may pose health risks if transmitted through contaminated water and cause gastrointestinal illness in humans100.Veillonella sp.might also play important roles in the microbial food web and biogeochemical cycles101, with another study reporting multiple antibiotic resistance (MARi) traits94. Another enteric pathogenic bacteriaAeromonas sp., is present in LP, with MARi traits; specifically, two virulent speciesA. hydrophilaandA. veronii,were reported based on a study within lakes of Udaipur102and Lake Erie103.Dechloromonas sp.apart from the nitrogen respiration is additionally associated with the degradation of contaminants, including dechlorination and nitrate reduction104under anaerobic conditions where it might take part in the degradation of microcystins105, also being a putative polyphosphate accumulating organism (PAO) possibly contributing to its removal in Lake Pichola explaining its presence in all seasons. Denitrification is primarily controlled byParacoccus sp.followed byZoogloea sp.andDesulfococcus multivoransin LP.Zoogloea sp.is an aerobic denitrifier reported to be present in oligotrophic lakes106, while strains likeZ. ramigeraoccur majorly within eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes and perform N removal107.D. multivoranshad been reported to perform other functions like sulfate reduction in anaerobic environments and completely metabolize carbon with the acetyl-CoA pathway under aerobic conditions, along with mercury methylation108and dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), thereby playing a crucial role in decontamination of sediments109. Looking at Ureolysis function,Roseomonas sp.is abundant, particularly at the PI site during the PR season, being a part of the potential pathogenic community110, exists in environments with high levels of contaminants like nitrate and radionuclides, incorporating genes associated with nitrate reduction and resistance against heavy metal pollution111. Lake Pichola had three species ofRoseomonasfrom which a novel strain ofR. lacuswas previously isolated from the sediments of Lake Taihu in China111, but further research is required to infer other ecological roles of theR. ludipueritiaeandR. terraein such systems.

The bacterial community associated with sulphur cycling had major proportions from bacteria associated with the respiration of sulfur compounds, under which the major contributors are from sulfate respiration, followed by thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfur respiration. Sulfate respiration associated OTUs or sulfate reducing bacteria SRBs are abundant in PR_PI and PR_PIII sites explained by S-RDA II, under the influence of high TN content, and sediment moisture availability.Desulfovibrio sp., being a SRB, is relatively more abundant in LP, suggesting active sulfate reduction within anoxic layers of sediments common in eutrophic lakes due to stratification and organic matter decomposition112. This bacterium could utilize different organic substrates and electron acceptors like sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate and is also reported to participate in direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), facilitating methanogenesis by transferring electrons to methanogenic partners, aided by prevailing organic matter degradation under eutrophic conditions113. OTUs like members associated with the Syntrophobacteraceae family in LP are known for their syntrophic association with methanogens, particularly by the degradation of fatty acids and other organic compounds for utilization by methanogens to produce methane114. Likewise, members from the Desulfocapsaceae family are abundant in LP, and their presence is often associated with polluted environments, particularly those with high levels of organic pollutants and alkalinity exhibiting higher richness and diversity in nutrients-rich environments.Synthrophobacter sp.is also abundant in LP, and from a eutrophication context, members from Syntrophobacteraceae, along with other genera likeGeobacterandMethanocella,may serve as indicators of nutrient-rich conditions and the ongoing biogeochemical transformations in the lake sediments115. In the case of sulfur respiration,Sulfurospirillum sp.is the major contributor, particularlyS. cavolei, andS. arsenophilum, indicating complete metabolic pathways as a part of chemolithoautotrophic processes116, which can reduce different electron acceptors like thiosulfate, sulphur, nitrate and arsenate and might interact with iron cycling82.Fusibacter sp.is a major contributor to thiosulfate respiration in LP and is capable of converting sulfur compounds like sulfate, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur to sulfide and fermenting various carbohydrates, producing end products like acetate, ethanol, carbon dioxide, acetate, and hydrogen117. Additionally, it possesses genes for pathways like the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway and pentose phosphate pathway118. In the case of dark oxidation of sulfur compounds, major OTUs are associated with dark sulfide oxidation, followed by thiosulfate and sulfur oxidation. Overall, the variability in OTUs associated with dark oxidation of sulfur compounds is explained through S-RDA I with possible influence from sediment characteristics like positive ORP suggesting oxic conditions, followed by SM availability, and relatively lower BD, favoring dissolution of gases and exchange in sediment pore spaces. In Lake Pichola,Thiobacillus sp.is a major contributor in dark sulfide oxidation, followed byMagnetovibrio sp.andSulfurifustis variabilis.Thiobacillus sp.belongs to the category of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) that can oxidize sulfur compounds to sulfate in two phases: a sulfate producing phase and a sulfur and sulfate producing phase to adapt with variable sulfide concentration in case of obligate chemolithoautotrophs119. Alternatively, certainThiobacillus sp.utilize both inorganic and organic substrates by growing mixotrophically120. A study on its use in bioreactors mentioned its potential roles in bio-augmenting processes like autotrophic denitrification and desulfurization121.Magnetovibrio sp.are microaerophiles, capable of both aerobic and anaerobic growth, exhibiting the chemolithoautotrophic growth on thiosulfate and sulfide with oxygen as a terminal acceptor and under anaerobic conditions, N2O acts as a terminal acceptor. They show a distinct lineage withMagnetospirillum sp., exhibit magnetotactic behavior, and support chemo-organoautotrophic and methylotrophic growth under microaerophilic conditions122.S. variabilis, another SOB present in LP, is an autotrophic bacterium that utilizes thiosulfate, tetrathionate, and elemental sulphur as electron donors to support its chemolithoautotrophic growth123and genomic analysis revealed that it carries redundant genes in sulfur oxidation and inorganic carbon fixation pathways124.

Littoral sediments demonstrated dynamic functional potential for all considered biogeochemical putative functions that depend upon variable sediment characteristics, distinct circumlinmal, and seasonal variability. Ideally, seasonal variability is the major driver for altering sediment characteristics, which in turn alters functional traits. Conversely, for the altered trophic state, the interaction of seasonal and circumlimnal conditions governs the functional trait variability. The shifts within bacterial community composition counter the variable environmental conditions, ensuring the continuity of the functional roles even under unfavorable conditions and highlighting the ecosystem’s resilience. The interactions between the bacteria associated with the three biogeochemical cycles (C,N, and S), particularly the electron transfer and donor–acceptor association, were also evident and should be accounted for in future studies, even if the focus is on a specific element. The FAPROTAX database is comprehensive, and we recommend its use for getting insights into ecological functions. Although it covers major biogeochemical functions, it would be wholesome if phosphate metabolism functions were present as well.

This study was the first attempt of its kind in the freshwater lakes from the semi-arid part of India. It demonstrated that the approach used in this study for estimating putative functions provides significant insights into quantitative estimates of functional profiles and their variability at an ecosystem scale. This approach is by far a cheaper and more reliable alternative where limited scientific literature exists about functional profiles, either only taxonomic features (OTUs) data is available, or screening of ecological functions is the objective in ecosystem-scale studies. Although thorough analysis, functional genomics, and enzymatic pathway analysis are recommended approaches in microcosm studies. Apart from providing a comprehensive outlook on variability assessment for biogeochemical function and underpinning the responsible factors, this study also emphasizes the invaluable importance of metagenomic analysis and functional profiling in assessing biogeochemical transformation.

In Lake Pichola, the methylotrophs and chemoheterotrophs are the frontline defenders that combat environmental degradation. At the same time, nitrate reducers consistently reduce mobile forms of nitrogen, implying substantial N immobilization either through assimilation by phytoplankton or macrophyte assemblages. Sulfate reduction by SRB aids in direct interspecies electron transfer and exhibits symbiotic association with methanogens and denitrifiers for metabolizing complex organic compounds, acting as a connecting link for the C and N cycles. Emerging patterns suggest a strong interplay between anthropogenic pressures and seasonal cycles. Sites with significant anthropogenic inputs, such as PI and PIV, often exhibited distinct functional profiles across all three biogeochemical cycles, underscoring the direct influence of human activity on specific biogeochemical pathways. The higher circumlimnal variability consistently observed in the PM season across most cycles suggests that post-monsoon conditions might foster greater microbial functional diversity and differentiation across the littoral zone compared to other seasons. These findings collectively emphasize that while seasonality imposes a broad framework, localized anthropogenic pressures and micro-environmental variations are critical modulators of the microbial communities orchestrating the biogeochemical transformations in this hypertrophic lake.
