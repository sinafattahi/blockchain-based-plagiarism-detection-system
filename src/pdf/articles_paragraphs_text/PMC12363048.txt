With the increasing incidence of joint diseases and the growing demand for surgical precision, robotic-assisted surgery has emerged as a promising advancement in orthopedic training. The Mako surgical robot, known for its precision in preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, may offer significant educational benefits to joint surgery fellows. However, its potential impact on enhancing traditional surgical skills and research capabilities remains underexplored.

To evaluate whether systematic training in Mako robotic-assisted hip replacement improves surgical performance and research skills among joint surgery fellows compared to traditional training.

From October 2021 to May 2023, 40 joint surgery fellows were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental group received a comprehensive and systematic mako robot-assisted hip replacement training course. The control group received traditional training in hip replacement surgery within one month. The results of operation simulation and questionnaire were used to evaluate the training effect.

The test results showed that in the simulation test of acetabular prosthesis placement, the overall pass rate of the experimental group was 90%, and that of the control group was 60%(p= 0.028). The results of the questionnaire showed that in clinical aspects, the score of surgical skill growth in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group after training [(10.9 ± 3.6) score vs. (4.4 ± 1.6) score,P< 0.001]. In terms of scientific research, the experimental group obtained more scientific research skills and abilities than the control group after training [(43.7 ± 1.9) vs. (25.0 ± 3.2) points,P< 0.001].

The Mako orthopedic robot system enables joint surgery fellows to improve the traditional surgical techniques and the capacity for scientific research.

With the continuous progress of medicine and the extension of human life, orthopedic diseases have become more and more the main problems affecting human beings. We gradually enter the aging society, the number of patients with joint diseases is gradually rising every year, and artificial joint replacement surgery is one of the important treatment means. In recent years, the rapid development of science and technology has provided support for the upgrading of services in all walks of life, especially in the medical field. In particular, digital, intelligent and automated technology makes diagnosis and treatment more accurate, and the treatment effect is more reliable, and surgical robots are an important representative product [1].

Mako Surgical robot system is one of the most advanced joint surgical robots in the world [2]. The two core technologies of Mako surgical robot are preoperative planning and intelligent assisted osteotomy. The basic principle is that doctors analyze preoperative 3D CT data with the assistance of robot system to make preoperative planning. During the operation, 3D images of the patient and hip motion parameters are transmitted in real time, and through a relatively minimally invasive approach, the orthopaedic surgeon can adjust or confirm the predetermined placement of the prosthesis in time, and perform the operation completely according to the patient’s hip anatomy [3].

However, in China, the application of orthopedic surgical robots is still in its initial stage, and related resources are more concentrated in big cities. For patients with treatment needs across the country, there are only a few surgeons who are familiar with and understand the use of surgical robots. For most joint surgery fellows, orthopedic surgery robots are not available in local hospitals, and even if they learn advanced technologies during the course of training in super-sized hospital, they still cannot carry out related operations after returning to local hospitals. However, the advanced surgical assistance technology still has great teaching potential. We hope to improve the traditional surgical technology and scientific research ability of the specialized students through the training of the mako surgical robot system during the training period.

Importantly, robotic-assisted training aligns well with established principles of adult learning theory, which emphasize the importance of self-directed, experiential, and feedback-rich learning environments for adult learners [4,5]. Robotic platforms provide real-time, measurable performance feedback and create a safe, simulation-enhanced learning context that empowers surgical fellows to actively refine their skills. This educational alignment may help orthopedic trainees develop both technical competence and scientific thinking more efficiently [6,7].

Therefore, to address the pressing need for more effective training methods in joint surgery, especially in the context of emerging robotic technologies, this study investigates whether the integration of systematic Mako robotic-assisted hip arthroplasty training can enhance both traditional surgical skills and scientific research competence among joint surgery fellows. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of Mako system training on fellows’ surgical performance, specifically in terms of acetabular prosthesis placement accuracy. The secondary objective was to assess whether such training also improves fellows’ scientific research literacy, including clinical study design, data analysis, and research communication.

Forty students who are studying joint surgery in Peking University Third Hospital from October 2021 to May 2023 are selected as the study subjects. All of these students are senior orthopedic surgeons from provincial and municipal hospitals, with an age range of 35 to 40 years old and working experience of 5 to 10 years. They have never received mako robot related training. All subjects have given informed consent to this study.

The students were randomly divided into 2 groups, 20 in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. They received the training of mako robot-assisted hip surgery system and traditional hip surgery instruction respectively. The observation period was 1 month (after the study, the control group also received the same training of mako robot system). Finally, the teaching effect of mako robotic surgery system training was evaluated through simulation assessment and questionnaire.

The control group received training in traditional methods, routine teaching courses and traditional surgical teaching. The experimental group received mako robot system training. In this study, we set up a curriculum plan and teaching system related to mako robot-assisted hip replacement surgery, including theoretical courses, teaching methods and evaluation. The whole mako surgical robot-assisted hip replacement clinical training includes the basic theoretical knowledge learning stage, the surgical video learning stage, the prosthetic bone operation training stage, and the surgical observation stage.

The whole training is expected to help the students get familiar with the operation process, instrument performance and software function of the robot; To understand the important anatomic signs closely related to robot localization during surgery and their application value; Experience the great potential of digital technology in scientific research. In the clinical aspect, the students can improve the deep understanding of traditional surgery and better feel the objective feedback of the placement Angle of the prosthesis; In terms of scientific research, it helps students make better use of intelligent storage and comprehensive digital image data, improve the design ability of clinical research topics, enhance the scientific research quality of students, and ultimately achieve the purpose of improving the quality of teaching.

The Angle of acetabular prosthesis placement in hip joint operation will directly affect the operation result, which is closely related to the incidence of postoperative joint dislocation. During the placement of acetabular prosthesis, the conventional setting Angle is 20° cup anteversion and 40° cup inclination. The content of the simulation assessment is as follows: After the intraoperative surgeon robed out the acetabular bone surface, the two groups of students placed the acetabular samples according to the anatomical positioning and their own clinical experience without looking at the operation prompt interface of the mako robot, and then calculated the probability of the placement Angle of the students in the safe zone by using the real-time and accurate cup anteversion and cup inclination Angle. The cup anteversion safe area is 15 ~ 25°and cup inclination is 35 ~ 45°.

The questionnaire was specially designed, in which the clinical competence related content was filled out by the two groups of students before and after the training, and the scientific research competence related content was filled out by the two groups of students after the training. Clinical competence related content including (1) How much do you understand the anatomy around the hip joint? (2) How much do you understand total hip arthroplasty? (3) How accurate is the placement of cup anteversion? (4) How accurate is the placement of cup inclination? (5) The accuracy of the postoperative same leg length. In this questionnaire, 0 is completely unknown and 20 is completely understood. Accurate to one decimal place.

Scientific research competence related content including (1) mako Surgical Robot System Training/Traditional training to improve my clinical research literacy? (2) mako Surgical Robot System Training/Traditional training to help me find clinical research ideas and direction? (3) mako Surgical Robot System Training/Traditional training will improve my ability to design clinical research projects? (4) mako Surgical Robot System Training/Traditional training will help me master the skills of clinical research through big data? (5) Does mako Surgical robot system training/traditional training contribute to the improvement of clinical research competency indicators? (Including teamwork, communication, critical thinking, learning ability, information literacy, etc.). In this questionnaire, 0 is completely unknown and 10 is completely understood. Accurate to one decimal place.

All data were doubly entered and verified in silico. All comparisons were made with the aid of SPSS ver. 25.0 software. Normally distributed data are shown as means with standard deviations; pairwise comparisons employed the SNK or LSD test. The χ2 test or Fisher exact test was used for univariate analysis, and a P-value < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.

The results showed that after the training, both the experimental group and the control group had significantly improved in terms of clinical and scientific research (Fig.1). In the clinical aspect, the evaluation scores of the experimental group were (76.4 ± 4.4) before the robot system training and (87.3 ± 3.0) points after the training. The evaluation scores of the control group were (76.1 ± 3.3) before the traditional training and (80.5 ± 2.0) after the training. After training, the increased questionnaire score of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group [(10.9 ± 3.6) score vs. (4.4 ± 1.6) score,P< 0.001].

Detailed item-by-item analysis also indicated that experimental participants scored significantly higher on all five clinical skill items, including anatomical understanding, prosthesis placement accuracy, and limb length equality, as well as on all research items such as topic selection, data utilization, and teamwork capacity (P< 0.001 for all items).

Combined with the data, it can be found that both training methods can improve clinical skills, but robot system training can enhance the understanding of hip replacement surgery more quickly and efficiently. In terms of scientific research, after one month of training, for the self-assessment of scientific research ability, the experimental group obtained more scientific research skills and directions than the control group [(43.7 ± 1.9) vs. (25.0 ± 3.2) points,P< 0.001].

Because advanced technologies improve clinical treatments, they should be widely applied. In China, most orthopedic robotic surgeries are performed in large cities, and there are not many skilled surgeons. Most local hospitals also do not offer such surgeries; thus, even if a doctor is trained in robotic surgery, s/he has no opportunity to practice it. However, it is important to change this. Moreover, receive mako surgical robot systems training can also improve their traditional clinical skills and scientific research capabilities.

In traditional hip surgery, the cup anteversion and cup inclination of acetabular prosthesis are a difficult problem in the operation, which requires the accumulation of many years of surgical experience and the mastery of operational techniques. This is also one of the pain spots in the current technology, and the abnormal placement Angle of the prosthesis is directly related to the postoperative prosthesis survival rate and the incidence of complications. Therefore, for young doctors, there is a long learning curve in order to position the acetabular prosthesis at a stable Angle. However, the objective digital real-time display and corresponding hand feedback in the robot system greatly improved the students’ handling skills for the difficulties in hip replacement surgery, and more intuitively helped the students to clarify the relationship between the anatomical position and the placement Angle of the acetabular prosthesis during the operation. It makes the placement of the implant more accurate.

The use of the Mako robot in clinical teaching has been reported [8,9]. Kolodychuk et al. [7] found that, after systematic training on robotics, both new and experienced surgeons achieved similar results; hence, the learning curve was greatly reduced. Scholl [10] also found that, after similar training, new surgeons placed joint prostheses as accurately as did experienced surgeons. Shapira [6] reported that the Mako robot was able to evaluate the positioning accuracy of acetabular prostheses, usefully guiding students and greatly enhancing their competence and confidence. Most studies focused on the ability of robotics to improve clinical effects [11–14]. Only a few studies have explored the educational role of Mako robot-assisted surgery.

Our study demonstrates that systematic training using the Mako surgical robot system significantly improves surgical precision and enhances research capabilities among joint surgery fellows. A particularly notable finding was that the improvement in acetabular anteversion angle accuracy was greater than that of the abduction angle. This may be due to the inherent technical challenges of controlling anteversion, which is more sensitive to pelvic positioning and surgical technique, and benefits more from robotic guidance. Improving the accuracy of acetabular anteversion has important clinical implications, as improper version is strongly associated with dislocation, impingement, and premature prosthesis wear. By reducing variability in this critical parameter, robotic-assisted training has the potential to improve patient safety and long-term surgical outcomes.

Beyond total hip arthroplasty, our findings may also apply to other joint replacement procedures, such as total knee and shoulder arthroplasty. Robotic systems have demonstrated benefits in component alignment, ligament balancing, and reproducibility in these surgeries, suggesting that systematic robotic training could play a valuable role across multiple orthopedic subspecialties.

Integrating robotic training into orthopedic education also aligns well with adult learning principles, which emphasize the importance of self-directed learning, experiential engagement, and real-time feedback. Robotic platforms provide immediate performance metrics, enabling trainees to refine their skills through deliberate practice in a safe and controlled environment. This educational approach enhances learner autonomy and may accelerate the acquisition of complex surgical techniques.

However, cost-effectiveness remains a critical consideration. Robotic systems involve high initial capital investment, ongoing maintenance costs, and specialized training infrastructure. From an institutional perspective, these costs must be weighed against potential benefits such as reduced complication rates, lower revision burdens, shorter hospital stays, and improved trainee outcomes [15]. While the current study did not include a formal economic evaluation, the observed improvements in surgical precision and research literacy may support long-term value by enhancing both clinical efficiency and academic productivity. Future research should incorporate economic modeling to quantify these benefits more precisely and explore scalable training solutions for lower-resource settings.

There are several practical challenges to the widespread adoption of robotic training. Robotic systems require substantial upfront investment and ongoing maintenance, which may not be feasible for many regional hospitals or training centers. Accessibility is further limited by the uneven distribution of robotic platforms, potentially exacerbating educational disparities between high- and low-resource institutions. Additionally, integrating robotic-assisted training into existing curricula requires careful planning to ensure alignment with current competency frameworks and assessment standards.

Despite these challenges, the educational and clinical benefits of robotic-assisted training support its gradual incorporation into orthopedic fellowship programs. Future studies should include multi-institutional collaborations, long-term follow-up to assess skill retention, and formal cost-effectiveness analyses to fully evaluate the scalability and impact of robotic surgical education.

This study demonstrates that systematic training using the Mako surgical robot system significantly improves both the traditional surgical techniques and scientific research capabilities of joint surgery fellows. Specifically, robotic training enhances the accuracy of acetabular prosthesis placement, particularly in controlling the anteversion angle, which is critical for reducing postoperative complications and improving patient outcomes. Moreover, the training fosters scientific research competencies, including clinical study design, data analysis, and critical thinking.

The integration of robotic-assisted training into orthopedic education offers a promising pathway to accelerate skill acquisition, improve surgical precision, and promote research engagement among trainees. These benefits may help standardize training, shorten learning curves, and ultimately contribute to better patient care.

Future studies should explore the long-term retention of robotic-assisted surgical skills, assess clinical outcomes in real-world settings, and conduct cost-effectiveness analyses to support broader implementation. Multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary training models may further enhance the educational value and accessibility of robotic systems in surgical education.
