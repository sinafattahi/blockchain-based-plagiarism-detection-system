This study aims to investigate pulmonary protective and antiinflammatory effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by meta-analysis.

Six databases were searched to collect trials on the pulmonary protective and anti-inflammatory effects of DEX in cardiac surgery with CPB. The search period was from the establishment of each database to August 1, 2024. Alveolar arterial oxygen partial pressure difference (AaDO2), Oxygenation index (OI), respiratory index (RI), IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP values were collected in CPB progress, end of operation, postoperative 6 h(POH6), and postoperative 24 h(POH24). The control group was treated with normal saline after anesthesia induction, while the experimental group with DEX.

A total of 9 articles were included. In the overall analysis, AaDO2 (SMD=-1.03, 95%CI:-1.62 to -0.44) and RI (SMD=-1.03, 95%CI:-1.90 to -0.16) in the DEX group were significantly lower than those in the control group, whereas OI was significantly increased (SMD = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.29–0.60). For inflammatory markers, levels of IL-6 (SMD= -1.96, 95%CI: -2.31-1.62) and TNF-α (SMD= -1.81, 95%CI: -2.36-1.26) were significantly decreased in the DEX group. Subgroup analyses based on the course of surgery presented a significant reduction in AaDO2 at the end of operation. At the end of operation, OI was significantly increased, while IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly decreased at POH6 and POH12. At POH24, no significant difference was found in CRP between the two groups (P> 0.05).

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technology has been widely used in clinical the practice of cardiac surgery [1,2]. CPB refers to a life support technology that uses a special device to draw venous blood from the patient during surgery, oxygenates it outside the body, and then transfuses it back into the body by a special device such as a blood pump to maintain blood circulation throughout the body [3]. Most patients have varying degrees of lung function injury after open-heart surgery under CPB [4]. Those with a low degree of lung function injury may have temporary lung function injury, while those with a severe degree of lung function injury may require long-term ventilator assisted ventilation to improve oxygenation after surgery. In severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur [5]. Deaths due to pulmonary complications after CPB can reach more than 30% of the total mortality after CPB [6]. Therefore, clinical protective measures against CPB-related lung function injury have always been a research hotspot.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a novel highly specific and highly selective α2 adrenergic receptor potent agonist [7], which can inhibit sympathetic nerve excitability and enhance vagus nerve excitability. It has the effects of stable hemodynamics, sedation, analgesia, anti-anxiety, reducing the dosage of narcotics and opioids, and anti-sympathetic nerve activity [7]. Studies have found that DEX can reduce the damage of various organs during ischemia-reperfusion, having potential protective effects on various organs such as the heart [8], liver [9], lung [10] and kidney [11]. Research on animal models has found that DEX can reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response during lung injury, exhibiting a significant anti-inflammatory effect [12]. Chi et al. [13] reported in animal experiments that DEX could alleviate acute lung injury caused by liver transplantation. It can alleviate the degree of lung injury by reducing the expression of autophagy and apoptosis-related proteins [14]. In a rat model of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury pretreated by DEX, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules decreased in lung tissue caused by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury [15]. A meta-analysis by Zhang et al. [16] in 2021 revealed that DEX could reduce the concentrations of CK-MB and cTn-I in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, presenting a protective effect on the heart.

At present, although several studies explored the effects of DEX on lung function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB [17–19], the results were inconsistent. Therefore, this study intends to use the method of meta-analysis to explore the lung protective and anti-inflammatory effects of DEX in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, so as to provide evidence-based medical evidence for the clinical protective effects of DEX on CPB-related lung function injury.

This meta-analysis was conducted in line with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) [20].

(1) Population: patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB in ASA grades I to III, aged over 18 years; (2) Intervention and comparison: the control group was given normal saline after anesthesia induction, while the test group was given DEX after anesthesia induction; (3) Study design: randomized controlled trial (RCT); (4) Outcomes: alveolar arterial oxygen differential pressure (AaDO2), Oxygenation index (OI), Respiratory index (RI), IL-6, TNF-α, CRP values at the time points of CPB in progress, the end of operation, postoperative 6 h(POH6), and postoperative 24 h(POH24).

(1) Insufficient data; (2) Animal or cell trials, reviews, abstracts; (3) Children were involved in the study.

Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the literature and collected data. Where there was disagreement, it was settled through discussion. Risk assessment of bias was carried out following the evaluation manual on the Cochrane Collaboration website. The seven items involved were: random sequence, assignment hiding, blind method of selecting participants, blind method of evaluating results, bias due to incomplete data, selection reporting bias, and bias from other sources. Each evaluation reference item is judged by “low risk”, “unclear risk” and “high risk” [21].

The following data were collected for the included literature: first author, year, country, sample size, type of surgery, age, induction of anesthesia, maintenance of anesthesia, and DEX dose.

Stata 15.0 statistical software was utilized for meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI were used as the effect sizes. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using the Chi-square test and I2statistics. If no significant heterogeneity was found (I2< 50%, andP> 0.1), a fixed-effects model was applied for data consolidation. Otherwise, a random-effects model was adopted. Subgroup analysis was performed based on the course of operation. Egger’s test was used to detect publication bias.

Nine records [17–19,22–27] were included in this meta-analysis (Fig.1), comprising 269 cases in the DEX group and 270 in the control group. The basic characteristics of the included trials are provided in Table1and Supplementary Table 2. The risk assessment results of the included literature are illustrated in Fig.2.

With respect to AaDO2 (I2= 86.6%,P< 0.001), RI (I2= 92.9%,P< 0.001), IL-6 (I2= 57.2%,P= 0.029), TNF-α (I2= 88.1%,P< 0.001),CRP (I2= 68.0%,P= 0.077), significant heterogeneity was observed in the combined analysis(Figs.3,4and5and A-C), so the random-effects model was eligible. Regarding OI, no significant heterogeneity existed, so a fixed-effects model was applied.

Four articles [18,19,26,27] were entered into the AaDO2 analysis, comprising seven studies at four time points (Fig.3). The results presented that AaDO2 was significantly lower in the DEX group than in the control group (SMD= -1.03, 95%CI:-1.62~ -0.44,P= 0.001). Two studies reported AaDO2 at the end of operation, with a significant decrease in heterogeneity (I2= 0.0%,P= 0.638). The results showed that at the end of operation, AaDO2 was significantly lower in the DEX group compared to the control group (SMD= -1.49, 95%CI:-1.88 to -1.09,P< 0.001). No statistically significant difference was seen in AaDO2 between the two groups at POH24 (SMD=-0.57, 95%CI: -1.71-0.56,P= 0.320).

Four articles [17,18,25,26] were involved in the RI analysis, covering five studies at three time points(Fig.4). The results showed that RI in the DEX group was significantly lower than that in the control group (SMD= -1.03, 95%CI: -1.90-0.16,P= 0.02). RI at POH6 and POH24 was reported in 2,2 studies respectively. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the two groups at POH6 (SMD=-2.85, 95%CI:-7.57~ -1.87,P= 0.237) and POH24 (SMD=-0.09, 95%CI:-0.47 ~ 0.29,P= 0.647). Heterogeneity significantly decreased at POH24 (I2= 27.0%,P= 0.242).

Six articles [17–19,25–27] were entered into the combined analysis of OI, comprising 11 studies at four time points(Fig.5). The results showed that OI was significantly higher in the DEX group compared with the control group (SMD = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.29–0.60,P< 0.001). Two, two, three, and four studies reported OI at the time points of CPB in progress, end of operation, POH6, and POH24. Subgroup analysis exhibited that, with the exception of CPB in progress, at the end of operation (SMD = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.26–0.98,P= 0.001), POH6 (SMD = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.35–0.92,P< 0.001), POH24 (SMD = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.13–0.63,P= 0.003), statistically significant differences were observed in OI. That is, OI in the DEX group was significantly increased.

Seven articles [18,19,23–27] reported TNF-α, involving 11 studies at four time points(Fig.6A). The results showed that TNF-α levels in the DEX group were significantly lower than those in the control group (SMD= -1.81, 95%CI:-2.36~ -1.26,P< 0.001). Three, two and five studies reported TNF-α at the end of operation, POH6, and POH24, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that at the end of operation (SMD=-1.73, 95%CI:-2.06~ -1.40,P< 0.001), POH6 (SMD=-1.29, 95%CI:-1.85~ -0.74,P< 0.001), POH24 (SMD=-2.42,P< 0.001), the levels of TNF-α 95%CI:-3.67~ -1.17,P< 0.001) were significantly decreased in the DEX group. Heterogeneity was significantly reduced at the end of operation (I2= 1.6%,P= 0.362) and POH6 (I2= 42.8%,P= 0.186).

Five studies [18,23,25–27] were included in the analysis of IL-6, encompassing seven studies at three time points (Fig.6B). The results showed that IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the control group (SMD=-1.96, 95%CI:-2.31~ -1.62,P< 0.001). Two, three studies reported IL-6 at the end of operation, POH6, and POH24. Subgroup analysis suggested that at the end of operation (SMD= -2.40, 95%CI:-3.03~ -1.78,P< 0.001; I2= 55.6%,P= 0.133), POH6 (SMD= -1.98, 95%CI:-2.44~ -1.52,P< 0.001; I2= 0.0%,P= 0.998), POH24 (SMD= -1.67, 95%CI:-2.13~ -1.21,P< 0.001; I2= 50.5%,P= 0.132). The levels of IL-6 were significantly decreased in the DEX group. Heterogeneity decreased significantly at the above three time points.

CRP at POH24 was reported in only 2 articles [22,23]. The results showed that CRP levels were not significantly different between the two groups (SMD= -0.70, 95%CI: -1.42~ -0.02,P= 0.057; Fig.6C).

In the analysis of AaDO2, OI, RI, IL-6, TNF-α and CRP, the P-values of Egger’s test were 0.961, 0.384, 0.048, 0.490, 0.044 and 0.057, respectively, suggesting clue of publication bias in this meta-analysis.

CPB-associated lung injury is mainly caused by factors such as the cessation of lung ventilation during CPB and the resulting non-expansion of the lung. Thus, the use of lung protective strategies during CPB could theoretically prevent the occurrence of CPB-associated lung injury. Various factors cause CPB-related lung function injury, which is caused by complex pathophysiological processes of multiple systems of the patient’s body. First of all, during CPB, lung tissue is in a state of high ischemia and hypoxia [28]. When CPB ends, the recovery of fresh blood results in the release of a large number of oxygen free radicals, resulting in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury [28]. Secondly, most studies have revealed that inflammation is one of the main factors causing lung function injury in patients after CPB, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by CPB is a crucial factor [29]. Dex can effectively inhibit the sympathetic nerve activity of patients, reduce the intensity of postoperative stress response, maintain the stability of intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate, alleviate the occurrence of SIRS, enhance immune function, and reduce the dosage of narcotic drugs, having a good clinical application prospect in the protection of body organs [30].

AaDO2, RI and OI are essential indicators of lung function. The results of this meta-analysis suggested that DEX could significantly reduce AaDO2 and RI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, while increasing OI, which has lung protection function. Chen et al. [31] reported that for obese patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, DEX could reduce AaDO2 and RI, but increase OI, inhibiting the inflammatory response of patients’ lungs. Meng et al. [32] revealed that DEX could reduce AaDO2 after thoracoscopic surgery with single lung ventilation and the impact of lung injury. In addition, the results of this meta-analysis indicated that DEX could significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory factors, TNF-α and IL-6, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, possessing anti-inflammatory effects. A meta-analysis by Hashiya et al. [33] suggested that DEX could reduce IL-6 levels in children during pediatric heart surgery.

We selected 4 time points of CPB in progress, end of operation, POH6, and POH24 for subgroup analysis. The results showed that AaDO2 and IL-6 were significantly reduced at CPB in progress. At the end of operation and POH6, AaDO2, IL-6 and TNF-α were all significantly decreased, while OI was significantly increased. At POH24, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were significantly reduced, with OI levels being increased. As for RI, no statistically significant difference existed between the two groups at POH6 and POH24. Chen et al. [34] revealed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly decreased in the DEX group 24 h after surgery in a meta-analysis evaluating the myocardial protection and anti-inflammatory response of DEX during cardiac surgery with CPB, which was consistent with the results of our meta-analysis.

The limitations of this review were as follows. First, the literature included was small, with only 9 articles. There were also few trials included in the analysis of each outcome indicator. In particular, CRP was reported only in 2 records. Second, the included studies comprised seven from China, one from Japan and one from Egypt. The coverage of included studies was not wide. This might cause some limitations in the extrapolation of conclusions. Third, the included publications were all small-sample RCTs, lacking multi-center, large-sample trials. Fourth, the administration time and dosage of various trials were not completely uniform, which might produce a certain bias in the evaluation of DEX effect to a certain extent. Fifth, there was significant heterogeneity in the combined analysis of AaDO2,RI, IL-6,TNF-α, and CRP. Sixth, publication bias existed in this meta-analysis. Despite the above limitations, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate DEX on lung protection function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, having crucial clinical significance.

In conclusion, DEX has lung protection and anti-inflammatory effects on adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. DEX could decrease AaDO2 and RI, increase OI, and reduce TNF-α and IL-6 levels in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Due to the limitations of this study, such as the small sample size, more trials with large sizes should be warranted in the future to verify the findings of this meta-analysis.
