The necessity to ensure safety in the work environment is a priority for the functioning of mines as enterprises with a high level of exposure to hazards. The basis for this is the identification of hazards to which mine workers are exposed. This article aims to identify and systematize safety hazards present in quarries. Based on a review of the literature, hazards were identified and classified into six groups: natural, environmental, technical and technological, human, organizational, and others. Additionally, a correlation was established between the identified hazards and the stages of the mine’s life cycle, as well as the methods of deposit extraction in quarries. The results presented in the article systematize existing knowledge on industry-specific hazards. The results can serve as a source of information when developing occupational risk documentation and its analysis, and form the basis for research on the causes and consequences of accidents in mining. Identifying hazards can also help effectively monitor them effectively and implement preventive measures to protect workers and reduce accident risks in quarries.

Occupational safety and health (OSH) encompasses a wide range of activities aimed at identifying, assessing, and managing risks in the workplace that can potentially affect the well-being and health of workers1. Achieving a comfortable working environment for employees is possible by ensuring the highest level of OSH within an organization. The safety management systems implemented in mines are based on various models. However, safety management is an essential element in ensuring effective and efficient safety practices within an organization2.

One of the most demanding industries in terms of workplace safety is rock mining. The extraction of mineral resources using the open-pit method is a complex process. Variable geological conditions of deposits, the presence of natural hazards, exposure to harmful environmental factors, and increased risk levels significantly influence the specific working conditions3,4. During mining operations, various accident-prone situations or potentially hazardous events may occur. Despite the decreasing number of accidents in mining5, their occurrence remains significant. It is important to emphasize that the consequences of accidents in mining are often more severe than in other industries6,7. This is due to the occurrence of various hazards in the mining work environment. Therefore, their elimination or reduction is critical and can be achieved through an appropriate safety management system, active involvement of management, and employee awareness.

A fundamental component of a safety management system is hazard identification. Hazards should be understood as sources of potential danger in the work environment, which can negatively impact the health and life of workers. Understanding hazards enables proper occupational risk assessment, evaluation of worker exposure, as well as the development and implementation of preventive actions. Failure to identify hazards prevents the implementation of preventive measures and effective communication aimed at preventing damage and accidents in the workplace8.

In the mining environment, some hazards are common across all heavy industries, while others are unique to this sector. Special hazards in rock mining are natural hazards and those associated with blasting operations. These hazards are strongly linked to geological mining conditions and the conduct of mining works. All hazards may have direct or indirect causes, which can lead not only to health damage but also to fatalities. The nature and effects of these hazards vary depending on the type and scale of mining activities9. This article aims to identify and categorize the hazards present in quarries. Identifying these hazards will help systematize their type and characteristics, which can be useful for managing safety in mining plants. Moreover, this information serves as a valuable resource when developing occupational risk documentation and its analysis. It may also form a basis for research related to the causes and consequences of accidents in mining. Many existing classifications in mining focus on the typical hazardous factors, particularly analysed in Sect. 2. Our proposed classification addresses a broader, systemic mine’s life cycle approach according to the methods of deposit extraction in quarries.

Surface mining of rock resources involves a range of hazards. In addition to typical, hazardous environmental factors such as chemical, physical, and biological agents, mining is affected by variable geological conditions of deposits, the occurrence of natural hazards, and other sources of danger. Particularly in quarries, hazards are not only related to the use of blasting techniques but are also linked to the movement of heavy vehicles and specialized equipment.

For the past 25 years, researchers at the Minerals Industry Safety and Health Centre at The University of Queensland in Australia, in collaboration with the industry partners and regulatory bodies, have conducted research aimed at improving risk management, safety, and occupational health in the mining industry10–12. In his work, Donoghue10analysed the literature on occupational health hazards related to mining and associated metallurgical processes. He then classified and characterized them into five groups: physical hazards, chemical hazards, biological hazards, ergonomic hazards, and psychosocial hazards.

Baghaei Naeini & Badri13identified 44 scientific articles in the Scopus database that describe research findings on OSH risks and hazards in mining. To gather reference data, they analysed standards for managing hazards and OSH risks in mining, referring to Canadian and international norms, regulations, and conventions (10 documents in total). Based on the literature review and reference data, they identified six categories of hazards in quarries: chemical, physical, biological, psychological, ergonomic, operational hazards related to open-pit extraction methods and tasks, and accident-related hazards.

The authors noted that some hazards originate from multiple sources. Therefore, they divided them into four sources of origin: operational, natural, technical and technological, and human factors (Fig.1). This study and the categorization of hazards within the mining system provide a valuable tool for hazard identification in OSH management. The authors stated that there is potential to address mining hazards overlooked in their studies, such as those described in internal government reports, patents, or other documents.

Expanding on psychological hazards, Stewart & Malatji14also included resistance to behavioural changes among employees. In addition to the factors and hazards identified by the researchers mentioned above, other scholars have analysed an additional category related to legislative and regulatory factors15.

A significant topics of recent research pertains to management-related hazards, encompassing several thematic subdomains including work culture16,17, communication18behaviour19, and safety training9,20–22. Bae et al.23conducted a study on quarry workers, emphasizing open communication regarding safety among employees. The authors demonstrated that workers improved their safety performance by translating the knowledge gained during training into practice, learning from colleagues, and sharing responsibilities within team members. This serves as an excellent example of fostering a positive safety culture in the mining industry.

A more comprehensive classification of hazards and factors was proposed by Rout & Sikdar24, who identified 11 major categories of hazards, including mechanical, electrical, heat, vibrations, noise, fire and explosion, dust, chemicals and toxic substances, biological, ergonomic, psychosocial, and radiological hazards.

work positions: specialized or those not directly covered by mining regulations.

hazards arising during specific blasting activities, such as transport, storage, priming, loading, preparation and connection of blasting networks, detonation of charges, inspection, auxiliary tasks, and malfunctions.

hazards resulting from the applied technology or type of explosive used.

general mining hazards, such as variable weather conditions, tripping, slipping, falling, falling from heights, being struck by fragments or overhanging rocks, abrasions and cuts from sharp edges, or stress factors.

A similar classification of hazards in blasting operations was proposed by Dworzak26. He identified four categories: method of work execution; work environment and conditions; materials used for the work; and equipment used.

In a study conducted in a quarry by Patyk & Nowak-Senderowska3, the identification of hazards was based on occupational risk assessment cards developed using the Risk Score method by occupational safety inspectors at the mine, as well as the results of a survey conducted among employees. The survey included workers from various positions related to the loading and transportation of extracted material in the quarry (mine foreman, loader operator, truck driver, mechanic).

In the first phase of the study, 55 hazards occurring at various workplaces in the technical and technological process of the selected mine were identified. These hazards were subsequently verified by the Mine Manager and the mine’s occupational health and safety team. This verification reduced the hazards to 40, which were then divided into four groups: hazards related to machines and equipment used, hazards related to exposure, hazards with an impact extending beyond the workstation, and hazards of an ergonomic nature. According to the workers, the most significant hazards at their workplaces are moving machinery and vehicles, direct exposure to harmful factors, and improper work ergonomics. Geological and mining hazards are perceived as less significant due to effective preventive measures and a strong safety culture within the organization3.

The identification of hazards in rock mining requires a systematic approach and a thorough understanding of the working conditions in the mine. The process of hazard identification and classification was presented by Baghaei Naeini & Badri13and is based on four stages: a literature review, a preliminary scope of occupational health and safety hazards, a final scope of hazards based on management standards, and the categorization of hazards according to each stage of the mining project (exploration, development, operation, and closure). As demonstrated by Baghaei Naeini & Badri13, the first step in hazard identification is analysing available literature, research, and scientific publications relevant to the subject under investigation.

Following this model, the research was divided into three stages, schematically presented in Fig.2. The final outcome of the research is a systematic classification of safety hazards arising from rock mining methods. This is supplemented by a classification of hazards within the mine’s life cycle27and a classification dependent on the adopted resource extraction technology.

In the first stage of the research, namely the collection, analysis, and processing of data and information from existing sources, followed by drawing conclusions about the studied problem, the desk research method was utilized. This method is based on the reanalysis of studies conducted by others or the use of pre-existing data, known as secondary data, which were collected by other entities. Secondary data originating from peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, BazTech), legal regulations (directives, act regulations, norms), official safety reports issued by recognized institutions (validated accident databases, statistical databases on accident rates Fig.2. Stage I) and information from mining companies were included. This approach helps researchers understand the research problem, grasp the context, identify new objectives, and define the scope of their study28,29.

In the next step, to search for answers to the research questions, appropriate and reliable data sources were identified in the form of government agencies, state institutions, educational and research organizations. A query was conducted in the databases of legal acts (European Union Legal Act Database EUR-Lex, Internet Legal Act System ISAP, European Committee for Standardization CEN, Polish Committee for Standardization PKN), bibliographic databases (Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, BazTech), and in the databases of institutions dealing with collecting statistical data and publishing reports in the field of occupational safety and health (Eurostat, International Labour Organization ILOSTAT, The U.S. Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration, Statistics Poland, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, The State Mining Authority, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, European Agency for Safety and Health at Work).

The final result of the query was the acquisition of research material in both English and Polish, consisting of current legal regulations related to occupational safety and health in mining, scientific publications related to the research topic, and statistical data on mining accidents along with their causes. This material was verified in relation to the relevance of the research topic.

After collecting the research material, an analysis was conducted to extract key information related to the hazards arising during operations related to the open-pit extraction of rock resources. Identifying hazards requires the researcher to adopt a systematic approach and a thorough understanding of the working conditions in the mine. To achieve this, an expert panel was created, consisting of experts (both scientists and practitioners) in environmental engineering, mining, occupational health and safety, corporate social responsibility, with knowledge and experience related to the working conditions in quarries. The experts, who are also the authors of this publication, reviewed the organized research data and the hazard classifications described in the literature. After analysing the collected material, the experts concluded that the hazard classifications described in the literature needed to be supplemented. Based on this, they proposed an original classification into six categories (Stage II of the research): natural hazards, environmental hazards, technical and technological hazards, human hazards, organizational hazards, and other hazards, which are detailed in the Results section.

After grouping the hazards and specifying their causes, the next step involves establishing correlations between the hazards and the life cycle of the mine, as well as the hazards and the extraction technology (Stage III of the research). The result of the conducted research is the development of systematics of safety hazards in quarries (Appendix 1).

It should be emphasized that the most characteristic hazards for rock mining were assigned to the identified hazard groups.

The group of natural hazards (Table1) includes all hazards related to geological and mining aspects, closely linked to the structure of the rock mass. Furthermore, these hazards are primarily defined by mining authorities due to their nature and scope of impact. These hazards often represent the most dangerous situations in mines, leading to serious incidents, accidents, or even disasters. This group includes landslides, falling rock faces, overhanging rocks, and rock fragments, as well as water hazards related to increased or uncontrolled inflow or the penetration of water from slopes, reservoirs, or surface watercourses into the mine workings.

Natural hazards and the causes of their occurrence.

Hazards associated with rock slides on the slopes of open-pit mines (Fig.3) pose significant risks and demonstrate complex mechanisms of deformation and failure50. A landslide is defined in various ways by scientists51–54depending on the location, conditions, and scope of impact. Most of these definitions are based on the general concept of a landslide as the movement of rock and soil masses that occurs downward along a slope, triggered by various external factors. Landslides are caused by factors such as geological conditions, slope angle, soil composition, and external influences like heavy rainfall, earthquakes, or human activity. It is important to note that a landslide constitutes a significant mining and geological hazard that causes damage to both the natural and social environment, and its impact is typically much broader than other hazards43. The risk of landslides is systemic, requiring coordinated and urgent efforts to mitigate them in an integrated and innovative manner. Understanding the formation of landslide risk is crucial for implementing preventive measures55.

A similar phenomenon is the detachment of rocks from mine walls, overhangs, and rock fragments, primarily observed in mines extracting consolidated rocks. Sloped terrain with a steep angle forms a structure resembling a cliff, creating an overhang. These geological features are inherently unstable, making them prone to rock falls56, which can trigger rock avalanches. The large number of macro- and microcracks that appear in rock overhangs57causes rocks to detach, creating hazardous working conditions and a risk to machinery safety. Falling rocks are strongly associated with the geological structure of the rocks, the geometry of the mine workings, long-term weathering, rainfall, or other factors.

Water hazards in open-pit mining pose a significant risk both to the environment and to mining operations46. Their occurrence can lead to severe consequences for the functioning of the mine, such as halting operational activities, material and human losses (serious and fatal accidents). These hazards result from natural processes (e.g., rainfall, snowmelt) or human activity (e.g., improper design of excavation slopes). Phenomena associated with water hazards include water flowing from slopes, water reservoirs, and watercourses. The first is caused by excessive rainfall, snowmelt, or natural water flow through rock structures58. Water from reservoirs presents a significant threat when the reservoir overflows or the structure is damaged, leading to the sudden influx of large amounts of water into the mine. Similar phenomena can be observed when water from watercourses invades the mine. The consequences of water hazards may include flooding of the mine workings with large amounts of water, destruction of the mine infrastructure, erosion of rocks, and the formation of landslides (Fig.4).

The group of environmental hazards (Table2) refers to the impact of the natural environment on workers. In open-pit mining, where the natural environment significantly affects the organization of work, its duration, and all employees, it is essential to identify hazards associated with changing weather conditions as well as the influence of fauna and flora. Schulte et al.60emphasize that workers employed in open-pit mining belong to a group exposed to climate-related hazards. Their exposure may be longer and greater than for other workers. Work must continue, and tasks must be carried out despite changing climatic and weather conditions. In this context, workers’ exposure to climate change is increasing61, which could result in a growing share of these hazards in accident events. The main environmental hazards in quarries are: frostbite and freezing, sunstroke, burns, natural disasters caused by the forces of nature, including floods, as well as aggression from animals, poisonous and toxic plants, and viruses and bacteria.

The next group of hazards are technical and technological hazards (Table3), which combine hazards closely related to machines, materials and tools used in a mining facility. These hazards arise from factors such as the organization of internal transport, the use of hazardous materials, the operation of machines, equipment, and tools, as well as their impact on the work environment and workers. Technical and technological hazards constitute the largest group due to the complexity of mining processes and the variety of technical solutions employed. Among these hazards, the following can be distinguished: improper handling of tools and equipment, both powered and non-powered, improper transport of people and materials, moving parts of machines and equipment, electric shock, improper storage of materials, protruding or sharp edges and elements, falling objects and crush injuries, rock fragmentation, splinters from rocks and tools, insufficient lighting, dust and emissions of pollutants, as well as noise and vibrations.

Technical and technological hazards and their causes.

Among the described hazards, those with the highest level of risk include the improper use of powered machines and equipment, as well as moving parts of machines and equipment. This is related to the heavy machinery used in mines and the severe health consequences that workers may suffer in the event of an accident. Additionally, improper handling of powered machines or equipment and moving machine parts are associated with mechanical failures, which are the most common cause of accidents in mining71. Noise and vibrations, as well as dust and emissions of pollutants, represent a significant group of harmful factors in the work environment of miners. However, exposure to these factors can contribute to occupational diseases or indirectly lead to accidents.

Another group of hazards are human hazards (Table4), which are associated with inappropriate behaviour of people, both employees at various levels and third parties. Dangerous actions by people are typically considered the main cause of accidents in the industry89–91. For example, in Fig.5, a machine drowning is shown, caused by the operator’s improper behaviour, resulting in their death.

The drowning of the operator inside the machine cabin (photo: District Mining Authority in Wrocław).

The group of organizational hazards (Table5) includes hazards related to the adopted management system and the way work is organized in mines in relation to health and safety. Improper management and errors in work organization generate hazards associated with lack of training, improper organization of work, improper workstations, or lack of professional qualifications. Organizational hazards are most often linked to management methods and decisions made by management personnel. According to Aliabadi et al.89,90, organizational shortcomings have both direct and indirect impacts on unsafe actions. Organizational shortcomings can also lead to poor supervision and create conditions that set the stage for dangerous actions. In particular, incorrect decisions made by leaders can result in accidents of significant severity113. Building an appropriate safety culture effectively helps eliminate most hazards in the work environment114. Furthermore, it seems that eliminating organizational hazards can significantly reduce human-related risks. Raising employee awareness has a considerable impact on thoughtful decision-making and taking safe actions115.

The last group includes other hazards (Table6), which are either unidentified or not assigned to any of the previously mentioned categories. These hazards are associated with specific conditions of mining operations or their particularities. Among them, we can distinguish fire, rock fragment dispersal (Fig.6), uncontrolled explosions, fire (Fig.7), contact with materials and chemicals, as well as unexploded ordnance from past wars.

Tables1,2,3,4,5and6form part of the safety hazard analysis in quarries. After grouping these hazards and clarifying their causes, the next step in the research is to establish correlations between the hazards and the mine’s life cycle, as well as the hazards and the extraction technology. Naturally, most hazards will occur at every stage, but certain nuances will be noticeable, helping to identify future research issues. Similarly, with the extraction technology, the hazards will generally be similar, but some hazards will be linked exclusively to one technological process. Such knowledge can be helpful and applied in practice, for example, in better tailoring training programs for employees working at specific positions.

The life cycle of a mine refers to a multi-stage process, as shown in Fig.8, where each stage has its own unique set of activities, risks, and environmental impacts122–124. The life cycle of a mine consists of the following stages of the mining project: exploration and assessment of the deposit, deposit development, extraction of the deposit, and mine closure. Exploration and assessment focus on identifying mineral deposits to develop mining projects through geological and survey work125,126. Deposit development includes planning activities related to designing an integrated system for managing the production cycle in the mine and preparatory work that allows the commencement of extraction while ensuring compliance with legal regulations. Preparatory work includes construction activities and the installation of equipment and structures, which cause the first effects and visible changes in the surrounding areas of the mine123. Deposit extraction is a key element of the mine’s life cycle and aims at conducting mining operations for extracting mineral resources122. Mine closure is associated with the completion of the deposit extraction, securing or decommissioning the mining facility, and restoring the natural state of the mine area. The closure stage is the final phase of the mine’s life cycle, which includes decommissioning, reclamation/rehabilitation, and monitoring the environmental conditions after closure127.

Mine’s life cycle (own elaboration based on Gholami et al.122.

Among all the stages of the mine’s life cycle mentioned, the most dangerous stages are deposit development and extraction (Table7). This seems quite obvious due to the concentration of tasks aimed at obtaining raw material from the deposit, using a range of mining technologies125. The exploration and extraction stage also includes both office and fieldwork. The hazards listed in Table7mainly focus on fieldwork, where various types of equipment are used for geological and mining activities. The mine closure stage most often includes tasks similar to those of the extraction phase. Therefore, the scope of hazards is quite similar. Mining is one of the most dangerous industries, where, as previously mentioned, the consequences of accidents are much more severe than in other sectors6,7. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate or reduce these hazards by implementing an appropriate work safety management system in mines. This system should inform employees about the hazards identified during the research that occur throughout the mine’s life cycle.

Hazards in rock mining depending on the stage of the mine’s life cycle.

excavation of compact rock for dimension stone by non-blasting methods (ECDN).

Hazards in rock mining depending on the method of resource extraction (Table8) are strongly linked to the applied technological solution. The diversity of technologies unfortunately leads to an increase in the number of hazards identified in the research. This shows that the same safety systems cannot be applied in every mine. They must be adapted to the mining technology being used. The developed classification of hazards in rock mining, taking into account the methods of resource extraction, can help tailor the workplace safety system for each mine extracting rock raw materials.

Hazards in rock mining depending on the method of resource extraction.

The developed classification of safety hazards in rock mining can be a significant support in the preparation of OHS documentation and occupational safety management. However, it should be noted that it has some limitations.

Firstly, the scope of the safety hazard analysis focuses on the most typical and characteristic incidents in rock mining. It is conceptual in nature and was developed based on expert opinions and available literature, which may have resulted in the omission of less obvious but significant safety hazards. Furthermore, it should be noted that in mining practice, there may be other hazards that are less common or specific to the geological and mining conditions or the specific nature of the mining technology, which have not been discussed in detail in this paper.

Secondly, although the article presents an innovative classification of safety hazards, the level of detail may not be sufficient for very precise risk analysis. The identification and assessment of risks often requires a much deeper understanding of the specific nature of a particular mine and the technologies used.

Another limitation is the lack of quantitative risk assessment. This article focuses on the identification and classification of safety hazards and their correlation with the mining method and the mine’s life cycle, but does not include a quantitative assessment of the risks associated with individual hazards, such as the probability of occurrence or potential effects. This type of analysis could be crucial for the effective prioritisation of preventive activities. However, this is a broad issue that requires a new systemic approach.

The classification of hazards and their causes, although based on a thorough review of the literature and consultations with experts, may be subject to a certain degree of subjectivity. Further research, based on the analysis of data from actual incident and accident reports, could significantly improve the accuracy and precision of the presented correlations.

Ensuring workplace safety is fundamental for the protection of human health and life. To achieve a safe work environment, it is crucial to identify hazards and implement actions to eliminate or reduce them. Hazards in the work environment are conditions that can lead to an unwanted event, such as an accident or occupational disease, and the likelihood of such an event is strongly related to the type of business activity and the scope of work performed by employees. Moreover, the adopted management approach and the level of occupational safety culture also influence the probability and frequency of hazard occurrence in the work environment.

Worldwide, mines are hazardous workplaces with a high accident rate89,90. Mining is a complex and multidisciplinary industry operating in dynamically changing conditions. Mining processes involve various obvious and hidden health and safety hazards, contributing to the risk. In a complex system, identifying hazards - sources of danger or risk factors - is not simple13. Inaccuracy in hazard identification leads to an incomplete risk assessment and a safety threat128.

The analysis of occupational hazards in each work process, especially in mining, should provide information about the wide range of diversity to take effective and comprehensive actions to reduce occupational risk, rather than just fulfilling legal requirements3,129. A key phase after defining the hazards is the introduction of preventive measures for occupational health and safety. To achieve this, a risk assessment must be conducted for each task and each worker. This risk assessment must consider all hazards and their interactions and must be revised when changes occur130.

Baghaei Naeini & Badri13indicate that research on hazard and risk analysis in mining is necessary, as it provides valuable insights into neglected mining hazards in future studies. Due to the complexity of mining hazards and the intricate relationships between them over time, it is important to seek new methods for risk assessment to predict and prevent hazards. This article aims to identify hazards specific to quarries. It presents selected categories of hazards based on a review of the literature and expert knowledge. The article proposes the identification and characterization of 6 groups of hazards arising from the methods of open-pit exploitation of rock resources. This serves as the basis for assigning hazards in relation to the mine’s life cycle, based on 4 pillars, and the adopted extraction technology.

The analysis revealed that a particularly significant group of hazards from the mining industry perspective is natural hazards, closely linked to geological and mining factors. Specifically, landslides and rockfall hazards pose a unique challenge due to their catastrophic consequences43. Similarly, environmental hazards, in the face of climate change, will constitute a significant group of hazardous conditions131. Technical and technological hazards encompass the broadest group of factors causing accidents, closely related to the technological processes used in quarries. Human behaviour and actions also significantly impact the safety level at workplaces, making human-related hazards and preventive measures a major challenge in achieving effective protection of workers’ health and life. Similarly, the organization of work, management, and the responsibility of leadership for employees play a significant role in the probability and scale of organizational hazards113. Other hazards not covered in the previous groups are related to mining operations (using explosives) or the specific nature of professional tasks. However, their impact can also lead to undesirable events or serious accidents25,26.

The classification of identified hazards in quarries according to the mine’s life cycle and methods of exploitation illustrated their scope of impact. Our analysis showed that all the characterized hazards occur during the stages of mine development and resource extraction. These are key stages of mining activity that focus on the actual feasibility of the enterprise. During these stages, heavy mining equipment, hazardous and harmful materials are used, and working in this environment requires specialized knowledge and qualifications. The second division, based on the methods of resource extraction, indicates that the exploitation of consolidated rocks carries greater occupational risk, especially when the material extraction process involves explosives. This seems quite obvious, considering the mining technologies used for extracting consolidated rocks and the parameters of the mined material, such as high cohesion and firmness of rocks, and their jointing. This requires additional measures and forces to extract the rocks compared to loose rocks.

Taking into account the conducted analyses, it must be recognized that new hazards may arise due to technological advancements, automation, interactions between components of current and future systems, as well as between human behaviour and technology, new social expectations and requirements related to social progress132, or growing environmental demands and climate changes. Nevertheless, the most important aspect is work safety management, including hazard identification, risk assessment, and the implementation of corrective measures. Poor management can lead to hazardous events and, consequently, to injuries or fatalities. Mine owners play a significant role in reducing the frequency of accidents and mining disasters71. Leadership shortcomings are associated with high-severity accidents113. Specifically, leadership deficiencies have been linked to high-severity accidents, while the physical environment (e.g., slips) often cause low-severity accidents, such as insignificant and minor accidents113.

Actions aimed at protecting and promoting the safety, health, and well-being of workers should increasingly focus on integrating complex and dynamic systems of work organization and work environment133. Proper and thorough hazard analyses of the work environment are crucial for assessing safety levels, and the implementation of elimination or preventive actions becomes a critical factor in the functioning of a mining enterprise.
