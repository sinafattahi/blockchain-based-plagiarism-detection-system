The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between plantar fascia (PF) elasticity, pain, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and plantar fascia thickness (PFT) in adults with plantar fasciitis (PFis). PF elasticity and PFT were measured in 40 subjects by ultrasonic shear wave elastography (USWE), and their VAS score and localized pressure pain threshold (PPT) were determined. Then, the correlations between PF elasticity and PFT, VAS score, and PPT were analyzed. PF elasticity was significantly lower in the PFis group than in the asymptomatic group (P< 0.001). PF elasticity at the point of calcaneus insertion was significantly lower in the PFis group (− 40.35% ± 9.81%,P< 0.001) but significantly higher in the asymptomatic group (26.69% ± 35.30%,P= 0.018) than that at 1 cm from this point. A significant correlation was detected between PF elasticity and both PPT and VAS scores. In terms of pain intensity, PPT and VAS scores showed a significant correlation (r =  − 0.921,P< 0.001). PF elasticity in different areas in patients with PFis was associated with pain intensity in terms of both PPT and VAS scores but not with PFT. USWE is a useful system for providing supplemental information in the diagnosis of PFis and provides quantitative parameters for monitoring therapy.

Critical relevance statementUSWE examination may exert a guiding impact on the pretreatment and posttreatment evaluation of patients with PFis.

Plantar fasciitis (PFis) is a common foot disorder and a major cause of heel pain in adults aged 40–60 years, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 10%1,2. PFis is often described as a degenerative condition caused by repetitive trauma, resulting in functional disorders, elasticity changes, and pain in the plantar fascia (PF)3–5. Contemporary diagnostic strategies integrate high-resolution ultrasonography, where B-mode imaging identifies structural pathology (insertional collagen disruption, fascial thickening > 4 mm), and power Doppler reveals layer-specific hypervascularization-distinguishing calcaneal-attached deep layer involvement from Achilles-continuous superficial pathology6–8. This spatial stratification has direct therapeutic implications, with deep-layer vascularization predicting responsiveness to intrafascial injections, whereas superficial lesions requiring targeted Achilles tendon therapies6. Crucially, sonographic stiffness quantification correlates with specific collagen disruption patterns, enabling mechanical phenotyping beyond conventional morphology7. Although MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast for complex cases, real-time ultrasound outperforms MRI in terms of dynamic assessment, guiding precision interventions through simultaneous vascular and structural evaluation7,9. These advances have established ultrasonography not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a therapeutic planning system that addresses both the biomechanical and molecular substrates of PFis. Ultrasound findings of PFis commonly include surrounding soft-tissue edema, thickening, fiber disorganization, and hypoechogenicity within the PF10. Nevertheless, these morphological changes are not always detectable by conventional ultrasound11–13. Changes in mechanical properties, particularly elasticity, are also associated with PFis2. A better understanding of the changes in mechanical properties in PFis could provide vital information for clinicians, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Mechanical properties such as elasticity and morphology, including plantar fascia thickness (PFT), are key indicators of tissue function, especially in force transmission, and have been used to examine the relationship between PF and foot function14. The PF is subjected to mechanical stretching due to repetitive loading during daily activities15. Overuse or inappropriate use of PF can cause microdamage and inflammation, resulting in PFis13. Previous research has demonstrated an association between PFis and changes in PF elasticity and thickness16. Considering its vital role in diagnosing and treating PFis, it is important to evaluate the mechanical properties of PF, which requires objective and reliable measurement techniques.

The elasticity of PF can be evaluated using methods such as palpation or using tools such as MyotonPRO17. Although accessible, palpation provides only qualitative data about tissue elasticity (e.g., soft or hard) and is not suitable for quantitative evaluation18. Conversely, MyotonPRO, although more advanced, may provide results influenced by the plantar surface tissue rather than isolating the PF19. Consequently, these methods are insufficient for accurately monitoring the elastic modulus of PF. Precise evaluation of PF elasticity is essential as it could improve diagnosis, monitor progression, and evaluate treatment responses in plantar fasciopathies20.

Ultrasonic shear wave elastography (USWE) is a novel, noninvasive, and quantitative technique used to evaluate the elastic properties of musculoskeletal tissues21–27. USWE has the potential to evaluate various biomechanical properties of PF1,4–7,11. Although PF elasticity and thickness have been examined in healthy individuals, there are limited data on biomechanical variations in patients with PFis1,4,13. Moreover, no previous studies have comprehensively investigated the elastic properties of different PF regions in individuals with PFis or explored the relationship between pain and PF elasticity.

To address this research gap, we conducted this study in which we measured shear modulus values to evaluate PF elasticity. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the shear modulus of PF in individuals with and without PFis, (2) explore the relationship between PF shear modulus and pain using both visual analog scale (VAS) scores and pressure pain threshold (PPT) in patients with PFis, and (3) determine the correlations between VAS and PPT scores.

This study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Shenzhen Dapeng New District Nan’ao People’s Hospital (approval number: 20230301009). Before participation, all individuals received a detailed explanation of the study objectives, procedures, and their rights as participants, and provided written informed consent for both study participation and the publication of identifying information/images in an online open-access publication.

We included 40 subjects with normal physical activity levels, of whom 20 patients with PFis comprised the PFis group, and 20 healthy asymptomatic subjects comprised the asymptomatic group. The inclusion criteria for PFis were as follows11,12: (1) presence of heel pain at the insertion point of the PF into the medial tubercle of the calcaneus, (2) a pain score of ≥ 4/10 on VAS, (3) pain duration of > 6 months, and (4) for patients with bilateral PF, the more symptomatic limb was determined through self-evaluation using VAS measurements and subsequently included in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) any previous lower limb pathology, such as infections, stress fracture, surgery, or musculoskeletal injury, and (2) any treatment for PFis or other treatments for the ankle/foot. The inclusion criterion for the 20 sex- and age-matched asymptomatic subjects was being healthy and fulfilling the exclusion criteria of the PF group.

Baseline characteristics, including sex, age, weight, height, BMI, duration of pain, and VAS score, were collected from all subjects.

The shear modulus of the fascia was measured according to protocols established in our previous studies22–24. Ultrasonic examinations were performed using a shear wave elasticity imaging ultrasound system (Aixplorer Supersonic Imagine, France) equipped with a 40-mm linear-array transducer (2–10 MHz, SL10-2) to capture images and calculate the shear moduli of PF. The settings of the Aixplorer scanner included a shear modulus mapping frequency of 12 Hz, the musculoskeletal mode for shear wave elastography, the penetration mode for the USWE option, an opacity level of 85%, a gain of 70%, a smoothing level of 5, persistence off, and a shear modulus of 0–300 kPa. The B-scan depth was maintained at 3.0 cm22–24. The quantification regions for PF were defined as the area between the calcaneus insertion point and 1 cm distal from this point. The diameter of the Q-box was determined by PFT, which was defined as the distance between its superior and inferior borders20.

Before starting the test, all subjects were instructed to rest for 10 min. The participants were subsequently positioned prone with their feet placed in a fully relaxed state and their ankles hanging freely off the edge of the examination bed. The shear modulus of PF was evaluated on the affected leg after moving the ankle into a state of passive relaxation. The PF was evaluated at two locations, viz., the calcaneus insertion point and 1 cm distal from this point. As recommended in previous studies22–24,28, a generous amount of ultrasound gel was applied to the skin over the PF, and the transducer was placed at the marker point without exerting pressure. Then, B-mode ultrasound was activated, and the signal was adjusted to visualize the superior–inferior borders of PF in longitudinal sections. Next, the USW mode was activated, the transducer was maintained motionless for at least 8 s, and the images were frozen until the region of interest became clear and stable. Two Q-boxes were then placed to calculate the shear moduli (Fig.1). This examination procedure was repeated three times in the same region, and the images and values were stored in the storage system of the equipment. Image quality was closely monitored throughout all measurements.

Ultrasound scan was performed with a 40-mm linear-array transducer (SL10-2, Supersonic Imagine, France). The participant was positioned prone, and the heel was placed in a neutral position on the edge of the examination bed to prevent tension in the tendons or muscles. The angle of insonation is paramount to avoid fake hypoechogenicity related to the artifact of anisotropy28. According to the specific presets of the ultrasound device, B-mode images were obtained to measure PFT in the transverse plane (the ultrasound probe is parallel to the ground) at the thickest point closest to the anterior margin of the calcaneus, and sagittal images were stored for offline analyses.

PPT refers to the amount of pressure at which pain is felt during the first steps in the morning. In this study, the degree of PFis pain upon taking the first steps in the morning during daily life was evaluated using the VAS score (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain). The degree of pain was also evaluated quantitatively over the PF using a handheld mechanical pressure algometer (MicroFET2TM Digital Manual Muscle Tester, Hagen, Germany). First, the wooden board to which the tester was fixed was placed on the floor at the edge of the wall. The subject was asked to stand against the wall and place the spot on the heel where pain was felt on the tester. Then, the evaluator instructed the participant to apply pressure vertically downward at a slow and uniform rate until he or she first reported a pain sensation similar to that felt upon taking his or her first steps in the morning.

Sample size was estimated using the G*Power 3.0.10 software. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY), and normality was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test. All data were normally distributed and are expressed as mean ± standard deviations. Independent t-tests were used to compare demographic variables (age, height, weight, and BMI) between groups. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate differences in PF elasticity between the PFis and asymptomatic groups, with significant variables used as covariates. Post hoc analysis via univariate ANCOVA was conducted when statistical significance was reached. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between PF elasticity, PFT, PPT, VAS score, and pain duration. Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05.

The demographic data (sex, age, weight, height, BMI, duration of pain and VAS score) of both groups are presented in Table1. There were no significant differences in sex, age, weight, height or BMI between the groups (P> 0.05). However, the PFT of the PFis group (0.47 ± 0.06 cm) was significantly greater than that of the asymptomatic group (0.31 ± 0.06 cm) (59.28%,P< 0.001).

Values are mean ± standard deviation; Asymptomatic group: Female 10 (ages 32–69 years), Male 10 (ages 35–69 years); PFis group: Female 10 (ages 36–69 years), Male10 (ages 33–62 years).

The mean elasticities of PF in the PFis and asymptomatic groups are summarized in Table2. At both the point of calcaneus insertion and 1 cm from the insertion point, the elasticity of PF in the PFis group was significantly lower than that in the asymptomatic group (− 85.78% ± 6.05%,P< 0.001; − 70.79% ± 12.45%,P< 0.001, respectively).

In the PFis group, the elasticity of PF at the point of calcaneus insertion was significantly lower than that at 1 cm from the insertion point (− 40.35% ± 9.81%,P< 0.001). However, in the asymptomatic group, the elasticity of PF at the point of calcaneus insertion was significantly greater than that at 1 cm from the insertion point (26.69% ± 3.53%,P= 0.018).

The correlations among PF elasticity, PPT, PFT, and VAS score are depicted in Figs.2and3. At both assessment points, significant correlations were observed between PF elasticity and PPT (calcaneus insertion point: r = 0.657,P= 0.002; 1 cm distal from this point: r = 0.520,P= 0.019) and VAS score (calcaneus insertion point: r =  − 0.724,P< 0.001; 1 cm distal from this point: r =  − 0.515,P= 0.020). However, no significant correlations were detected among PFT and PF elasticity, PPT, or VAS score (allP> 0.05). Regarding pain intensity evaluated using the two methods, a significant correlation was observed between PPT and VAS scores (r =  − 0.921,P< 0.001).

Scatter plots were showed the correlations between the PPT and the VAS score. r =  − 0.921,P< 0.001; Since some patients with PFis have the same ppt value and VAS score, there are only 15 small circles in the figure.

This cross-sectional study showed that PF elasticity in the PFis group was significantly lower than that in the asymptomatic group, particularly at the point of calcaneus insertion. Moreover, PF elasticity moderately and significantly correlated with foot pain, as evaluated through PPT and VAS scores. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between PF elasticity and pain outcomes in different regions of PF in patients with PFis. Furthermore, USWE was shown to be valuable for identifying PFis based on VAS and PPT scores.

PFis is a common cause of heel pain, primarily due to repeated trauma to the PF15. The significantly lower PF elasticity in patients with PFis than that in asymptomatic subjects indicates that the fasciae of these patients are “softer” or “less elastic” than those of healthy subjects. In fact, previous research has reported softening of PF on the affected side13. Gatz et al. demonstrated a significant reduction in shear moduli in patients with symptomatic PFis29. This disparity may be attributable to the associated degenerative processes that result in PF collagen breakdown, fibroblastic hypertrophy, and matrix degradation and ultimately lead to a lack of elasticity in the affected fascia13. Our study also showed significantly lower PF elasticity in the PFis group at the point of calcaneus insertion than at 1 cm distal from this point. However, in the asymptomatic group, this relationship was reversed, with PF elasticity at the point of calcaneus insertion being significantly greater than that at 1 cm distal from this point. This finding could be interpreted in terms of the differing levels of tensile stress experienced at different PF regions, leading to distinct histological alterations in the tissue (such as varying degrees of edema and thickening) and ultimately resulting in inconsistent PF elasticity at different locations30. According to the literature, These regional elasticity variations likely reflect Windlass Mechanism-driven stress gradients during gait. The PF experiences peak tension at its calcaneal insertion during toe-off31, while mid-substance regions endure lower strain, potentially explaining site-specific histological adaptations (e.g., localized thickening) and mechanical disparities. This biomechanical model substantiates our observed elasticity patterns32–34. Moreover, the PF is thickest at the heel34, and from this perspective, evaluating the elastic properties at the location of the maximum thickness of PF could provide a more accurate indication of the pathological state of PFis.

Our study revealed a statistically significant inverse correlation between PF elasticity and VAS score. To our knowledge, only one other study conducted by Schillizzi et al. has explored the relationship between pain and PF elasticity in individuals with plantar heel pain, in which the relationship was evaluated 1 cm distal from the point of calcaneus insertion13. The authors compared the elasticity between patients with PFis and asymptomatic participants using USWE and reported that symptomatic patients with PFis had significantly lower Young’s moduli than control participants and identified a strong positive correlation between Young’s modulus and pain score13. Because the characteristics of the fascia, such as elasticity, can differ between fasciae from different patients and within the same fascia (e.g., proximal versus distal), the present study evaluated the elasticity of PF at different positions (calcaneus insertion point vs. 1 cm distal from this point)35. Our results indicated that the USWE values at both locations on the PF correlated with the VAS score. Interestingly, the correlation between VAS score and PF elasticity at the point of calcaneus insertion appeared to be greater than that at 1 cm distal from this point (r =  − 0.724 vs. r =  − 0.515). This finding indicates that the elasticity of PF 1 cm distal from the calcaneus insertion point is less sensitive in indicating the clinical symptoms of fascia heel pain than that at the calcaneus insertion point. This may be attributed to the failure of PF in PFis. The most common location where symptoms of plantar fasciopathy occur is at the proximal attachment to the calcaneus36. From this perspective, evaluating PF elasticity at the calcaneus insertion point could provide valuable information regarding plantar fasciopathy for evaluating the severity of the condition and guiding treatment planning.

A relevant finding of the present study is the significant positive relationship between PF elasticity and PPT, wherein the greater the PPT (i.e., the lower the heel pain intensity), the greater the PF elasticity. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported an association between PF elasticity and PPT. This finding further advances the current understanding of the relationship between pain and PF elasticity. A primary characteristic of PFis is pain when pressure is applied at the calcaneus insertion point of the PF. Previous studies have reported a significantly lower PPT of the most symptomatic limb in patients with plantar fasciopathy than in pain-free controls37–39. These findings suggest that patients with plantar fasciopathy experience increased local pain sensitivity. The handheld mechanical pressure algometer provides a reliable and reproducible method for measuring pain sensitivity, evaluating it over the most sensitive area to achieve the most precise measurement possible. This device has been widely used in the evaluation of pain severity and intervention efficacy in patients with PFis40,41. Marta et al. reported a positive correlation of increased pain intensity and a thicker fascia with heightened pressure pain sensitivity in patients with unilateral plantar heel pain40. Ajimsha et al. used PPT as an indicator of efficacy to observe whether fascial release could reduce plantar pain41. Their results showed a significant decreased in PPT after treatment41. Therefore, our study demonstrated that the elasticity of PF in patients with PFis measured by USWE may affect the severity of the patient’s symptoms to a certain degree. We believe that the elasticity of PF is an important reference parameter in treatment planning and evaluation management, which may help health care workers decide on implementing active intervention measures for patients; however, further studies are required to confirm this proposal.

This study revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation between PPT and VAS score. Interestingly, the correlation between VAS score and PF elasticity at the point of calcaneus insertion appeared to be greater than that between PPT and PF elasticity at the same point. This is an expected finding, considering that the two measurements were obtained on the basis of the patients’ subjective pain sensations upon taking their first steps in the morning. Our findings are also similar to those reported in other studies. For instance, Alahmariet et al. used PPT to evaluate the degree of pain experienced by older adults with knee arthritis and reported a significant correlation between VAS score and PPT42,43. Jorge et al. also reported a significant correlation between VAS score and PPT in patients with knee osteoarthritis44. Therefore, although the two assessment methods are different, they provide consistent information regarding subjective pain. Nevertheless, if a choice must be made between VAS score and PPT, we suggest selecting a more convenient, rapid, and flexible VAS score to determine pain intensity for patients to guide the clinical formulation of personalized diagnosis and treatment plans45. However, if the intention is to evaluate the effect of treatment for making adjustments to the treatment plan, a more objective PPT can be recommended, as individuals often struggle to recall previous pain levels, information that is important to perform direct estimates of changes.

We found no correlation between PFT and PF elasticity, PPT, or VAS scores, consistent with previous studies. For instance, Baur et al. reported no correlation between PFT (6.1 mm in patients with PFis vs. 3.3 mm in healthy subjects) and PF elasticity1. Ostermann et al. demonstrated that although PFT increased in the stretched position, it did not affect PPT37. Similarly, Gamba et al. found no correlation between PFT and clinical symptoms such as pain (VAS score) in patients with PFis46. These findings suggest that PFT is not a reliable indicator of treatment response in patients with PFis. Instead, other ultrasonographic parameters, such as elasticity, echogenicity, and vascularity, should be considered in diagnosing and monitoring PFis.

Our study suggests USWE as a potentially transformative tool for an objective assessment of variations in regional elastic modulus, thereby enabling (i) biomechanical phenotyping for patient stratification, (ii) data-driven therapeutic selection, and (iii) quantitative monitoring of tissue remodeling and also addressing the fundamental limitations of current symptom-based management approaches. Current therapeutic approaches for plantar fasciopathy include targeted mechanotherapy, optimized extracorporeal shockwave protocols, ultrasound-guided delivery of orthobiologics e.g., leukocyte-rich PRP, and precision physical therapies47. Furthermore, relevant studies have demonstrated the diagnostic value of USWE in visualizing myofascial trigger points and spasticity, supporting the clinical use of ultrasound-guided therapies for pain modulation48–50. Ultrasound-guided dry needling (US-DN) of myofascial trigger points has been established as a primary intervention option for plantar fasciopathy18,51,52. Malo-Urriés et al. found ultrasound-guided needling significantly improved accuracy (p< 0.001) in targeting the plantar fascia-flexor digitorum brevis interface versus palpation-guided methods, with equivalent safety (p= 0.249), supporting its use for precise plantar heel pain intervention18. Malik et al. found ultrasound-guided dry needling improved symptoms in 80% of plantar fasciopathy patients by 4 weeks, offering a less invasive alternative to surgery51. Asokumaran et al.’s network meta-analysis (n = 2390) demonstrated that acupuncture/dry needling achieved superior short-term pain relief in plantar fasciopathy versus placebo (VAS MD − 1.33 at 1 month), with efficacy comparable to second-line therapies like ESWT and PRP52. Additionally, studies have reported precision ultrasound-guided ESWT as a promising treatment modality, particularly in cases where elasticity changes are localized. Real-time imaging guidance and regional targeted treatment can significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ESWT53–55. Future studies should systematically investigate how distinct therapeutic modalities differentially influence region-specific viscoelastic properties and pain modulation in patients with plantar fasciopathy, particularly in site-specific elasticity zones identified by USWE. This mechanistic approach could help establish evidence-based correlations between tissue-level biomechanical recovery and clinical outcomes, ultimately informing personalized treatment algorithms. Additionally, future clinical studies will investigate the application of USWE in evaluating longitudinal functional responses to interventions (e.g., comparing outcomes before and after US-DN or ESWT), thereby informing potential treatment plan modifications.

Our study had several limitations. First, it was conducted at a single center and involved a relatively small sample size. None of the participants were examined by MRI. Second, the inclusion of patients with bilateral involvement may have introduced a bias in the evaluation of VAS scores, particularly in cases where patients presented with bilateral symptoms. Third, this study only evaluated the elasticity of the plantar fascia in the longitudinal direction. Future research should incorporate both longitudinal and transverse assessments to demonstrate consistency across different tests. Fourth, stabilization systems (e.g., ProbeFix) were not used to minimize potential variability induced by transducer pressure. Future investigations should incorporate more objective measurement methodologies to mitigate its potential impact on USWE values. Integration of mechanical stabilizers (e.g., ProbeFix) could improve reproducibility across sessions and operators. Fourth, all elasticity measurements were conducted with the foot in a completely relaxed state, and the current experimental setup (prone position, foot suspended) may not simulate real biomechanical loads. To further validate USWE as a clinical tool in PFis, future research should evaluate PF elasticity during passive dorsiflexion, dynamic movements, or under functional loading conditions. Furthermore, studies evaluating the relationship between elasticity and biomechanical compensations in gait (e.g., pronation and arch drop) could improve personalized therapy planning.

Elasticity in the two areas of PF in patients with PFis was associated with pain intensity (according to both PPT and VAS scores) but not with PFT. USWE might be a useful method for providing supplemental information for diagnosing PFis and provides quantitative parameters for monitoring therapeutic outcomes. Improving PF elasticity in patients with PFis can exert positive effects on heel pain and have beneficial outcomes for overall lower extremity function.
