Interferometric-based
microscopies stand as powerful
label-free
approaches for monitoring and characterizing chemical reactions and
heterogeneous nanoparticle systems in real time with single-particle
sensitivity. Nevertheless, coherent artifacts, such as speckle and
parasitic interferences, together with limited photon fluxes from
spatially incoherent sources, pose an ongoing challenge in achieving
both high sensitivity and throughput. In this study, we systematically
characterize how partial coherence affects the signal contrast and
background noise level in inline holography microscopes operated in
a reflection geometry, a category that encompasses interferometric
scattering microscopy (iSCAT). This approach offers a route to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio in the detection of single nanoparticles
(NPs), irrespective of their size and composition or the light source
used. We first validate that lasers can be modified into partially
coherent sources with performance matching that of spatially incoherent
ones while providing higher photon fluxes. Second, we demonstrate
that tuning the degree of partial coherence not only enhances the
detection sensitivity of both synthetic and biological NPs but also
affects how signal contrasts vary as a function of the focus position.
Finally, we apply our findings to single-protein detection, confirming
that these principles extend to differential imaging modalities, which
deliver the highest sensitivity. Our results address a critical milestone
in the detection of weakly scattering NPs in complex matrices, with
wide-ranging applications in biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemical
synthesis, and biosensing, ushering in a new generation of microscopes
that push both the sensitivity and throughput boundaries without requiring
beam scanning.

Recent advances in biotechnology, nanotechnology,
material science,
and chemical synthesis have enabled the engineering of new functional
nanoparticle systems with applications ranging from gene delivery,,targeted therapy, biosensing to heterogeneous catalysis. Additionally, molecular profiling of biological nanoparticles
found in the secretome, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs), holds
promise as next-generation liquid biopsies and drug delivery carriers. Consequently,
there is a growing demand for high-throughput quantitative characterization
tools offering single-particle sensitivity. By eliminating the need
for sample handling and processing, label-free approaches are among
the most suited for this task. Those based on interferometry in a
reflection geometry stand out due to their inherent high sensitivity.
The combination of shot-noise-limited detection with high-photon-flux
light sources ensures that enough scattered photons from the smallest
of nanoparticles reach the sensor and generate sufficient signal contrast,
enabling single protein and nucleic acid detection, tracking, and
subsequent characterization,−as well as monitoring of complex
reactions ranging from autocatalysis, nanoparticle formation,covalent organic framework
formation, and tracking of single-particle
ion dynamics.

The requirement for
high photon flux sources is typically satisfied
using high-power CW lasers, which are both spatially and temporally
coherent illumination sources. However, achieving high sensitivity
at high throughput with these light sourcesdefined here in
terms of the size of the field of view (FOV) per unit timeremains
a significant challenge. On the one hand, coherent artifacts such
as speckles and parasitic interferences severely degrade the image
quality for wide-field imaging.,On the other hand,
reducing these coherent artifacts with a spatially coherent light
source (CW laser) by turning the imaging system into a partially coherent
one, either by loosely focusing the beam into the BFP of the objective
or opting for a confocal illumination, comes at the expense of a smaller
FOV. To best capture these differences,Figureillustrates the image formation principle
in a reflection-based interferometric microscope for three different
scenarios: (i) a coherent imaging system with a spatially coherent
light source, (ii) a partially coherent imaging system with a spatially
coherent light source, and (iii) a partially coherent imaging system
with a spatially incoherent light source. The first case (Figureb, left column) is
represented by Köhler illumination, where larger FOVs result
from focusing the light source tightly into the BFP of the objective,
essentially lowering the spatial frequency bandwidth, which in turn
increases the spatial coherence of the imaging system, thus leading
to coherent artifacts and lower spatial resolution, as represented
in the optical transfer function (OTF). The second case (Figureb, middle column)
represents a partially coherent microscope resulting from increasing
the size of the illuminating beam at the BFP, which can be experimentally
achieved by weakly focusing a laser into the BFP or confocally illuminating
the sample. Under this scenario, the spatial frequency bandwidth increases,
thus lowering the spatial coherence and increasing the resolution
of the imaging system. However, this reduces the FOV, as shown in
the middle column ofFigureb. Solutions to extend the FOV exist, either in the form of
rapid beam scanning of a weakly focused beam with acousto-optic beam
deflectors, raster scanning confocal
detection,,spinning disk confocal, or rotational integration of oblique scanning yet these come with drawbacks such as high peak
intensities and limited scanning speeds that may ultimately restrict
the throughput. The third case showcases an alternative solution to
this problem, which involves using a spatially incoherent illumination
source,−such as multimode fiber-coupled light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which
not only deliver larger FOVs with minimal coherent artifacts but also
flat-top illumination profiles (Figureb right column).
Similarly, the use of rotating diffusers applied to inline holography
in reflection geometry was also recently demonstrated for the first
time alongside LEDs and later showed
that, when combined with a tunable lens, it can be used to further
tailor the spatial coherence of the light source.

Given the discrepancies between groups and the general knowledge
that partial coherent imaging systems should be preferred when high-throughput
imaging weakly scattering objects, the question of how to tailor the
degree of partial coherence to maximize the SNR and quantify single-particle
signals in the least amount of time remains largely unanswered. This
study addresses this gap and provides a solution applicable to metallic,
dielectric, and biological nanoparticles for interferometric microscopes
in a reflection geometry. To do so, we developed a platform that allows
the simultaneous tuning and measurement of the degree of partial coherence.
We specifically characterized the dependence of the signal contrasts
and the background noise contributions to find the experimental parameters
that not only optimize the SNR and acquisition throughput but also
reliably detect all NPs within the same focus position. We further
demonstrated that such partially coherent systems are compatible with
a differential imaging modality, thus enabling sensitivities compatible
with single protein detection but with orders of magnitude larger
FOVs compared to the state-of-the-art. The results from this work
show that partially coherent systems provide a route to pushing the
sensitivity and throughput of state-of-the-art interference-based
label-free microscopes to new boundaries.

In
this work, we quantitatively assessed how spatial coherencein
other words, the degree of partial coherenceinfluences the
detection sensitivity at the single-particle level. To achieve this,
we incorporated a module that precisely controls and measures this
parameter into an existing reflection-based interferometric microscope.
The degree of partial coherence was quantified by the coherence parameter,s, defined as the ratio of the numerical aperture of illumination
to that of the detection objective:s= NAi/NAobj. This parameter extensively used
in microscopy and holography to describe
the spatial coherence of the imaging system, on the one hand, allows
classification of the imaging system into coherent for s→0,
partially coherent for 0 <s< 1, and incoherent
fors≥ 1, and on the other hand, provides
a framework to characterize partially coherent systems from the perspective
of spatial frequency bandwidth. To tunesexperimentally, we varied the size of an adjustable iris
relay imaged to the back focal plane (BFP) of the objective, effectively
decoupling NAifrom NAobj(Figurea). As light sources,
we used both a laser diode and an LED, with their respective spectra
shown inFigureb.
In addition, light from the laser diode was turned into a partially
coherent illumination source by focusing it onto a rotating ground
glass diffuser (RGG) before coupling
it into a multimode fiber (Figurec).

open adjustable iris.

Figured depicts
the experimental setup comprising a custom-built common-path interferometric
microscope operating in reflection mode, featuring four different
modules: imaging, focus stabilization, light source input, and measurement
of the NAi. The focus control module,
together with the XY motorized sample stage, enabled automation of
the XYZ sample scanning assays with focus position stabilization to
within 10 nm. The NAiwas tuned in the
illumination module by adjusting the size of the iris and subsequently
measured in a separate k-space imaging channel.Figuree shows a representative k-space image for
a sample composed of immobilized nanoparticles at the glass–air
interface. The observed bright ring corresponds to the total internally
reflected incident angles of illumination (NAi≥ 1), with the inner and outer radii of the ring corresponding
to NA = 1 and NAobj, respectively. Using the value of NA
= 1 from the glass–air interface as an internal reference we determined all input NAiand, therefore,s.

One of the main advantages
of using LEDs in partially coherent imaging systems is the simultaneous
reduction of speckle noise and access to large FOVs. However, their
lower photon flux compared to lasers restricts the available photon
budget for either sensitivity or throughput, but not both. To overcome
this limitation, we converted a laser into a spatially incoherent
light source by increasing its spatial frequency bandwidth when illuminating
through an RGG and coupling the transmitted light into a multimode
fiber with more than 50% efficiency (seeMethods). This effectively suppresses coherent imaging artifacts associated
with the laser via angular, spatial, and temporal domain averaging.

To validate the equivalence between the two light sources at the
same fluences, irrespective of particle size and refractive index,
we evaluated the particle contrast and image noise from a polydisperse
sample containing 20 nm Au, 40 nm Au, and 142 nm SiO2nanoparticles
at a fixed partial coherence parameters= 0.51 (NAi= 0.73). To increase particle statistics,
the sample was raster-scanned over a total area of roughly 450 ×
450 μm2, corresponding toN= 10 FOVs of approximately 45× 45  μm2. Notably, the sensor limited the size of the FOV recorded from a
single image, given the nearly 4.5× larger illuminated area (9331
μm2). To ensure that the optimal signal contrast
for each NP type was recorded, at each sample position, the focus
was scanned across 3 μm in 100 nm steps, denoted here as a defocus
scan.Figurea shows
representative images of the polydisperse sample deposited on the
glass coverslip at two different focus positions.

for delivering partial coherence. (a) Representative
images of the same sample region area at two different focus positions

NP sample consists of 20 nm AuNP, 40 nm AuNP, and 142 SiO2NP sample. (b) Corresponding distribution of particle contrasts
as a function of focus position. Each color represents a different
particle population, with solid lines representing the mean, and the
shaded regions representing ± one standard deviation. The number
of detected nanoparticles consisted of 20 nm AuNP (241), 40 nm AuNP
(136), and SiO2NPs (31) for the measurement performed using
the LED. For the RGG experiment, the number of detected nanoparticles
consisted of 20 nm AuNP (285), 40 nm AuNP (105), and SiO2NPs (51). (c) Local (pink) and global (purple) background noise distributions
measured in standard deviations (σ) for different light sources.
The corner images depict an empty region of the sample, highlighted
by the red box in (a), with the contrast adjusted to ± 0.01 to
emphasize the background noise. The areas within the image indicate
the regions used to calculate global and local standard deviations
for the histograms, with one standard deviation computed per region.
The pink area includes 51 × 51 pixels2and the purple
area includes 3 × 3 pixels2, with one pixel corresponding
to an area of 45 × 45 nm2.

To characterize the particle contrast as a function
of defocus,
individual particles were localized and subsequently classified. Defocus
scans of samples containing only one particle species at a time served
as a reference for classification.Figureb shows the average contrast curves ±
one standard deviation (shaded area) for each particle population.
The shaded regions reflect the intrinsic size dispersion of each particle
distribution. These scans showed a characteristic oscillatory behavior
between positive and negative contrast, a pattern that was distinct
for each of the three particle species. Furthermore, the maximum contrast
magnitude for each particle type occurred at different defocus positions,
consistent with contrast tuning with the Gouy phase,and
the phase transfer function.,Minor deviations between
contrast curves from the two different light sources were attributed
to slight spectral differences. Nonetheless, these defocus scans demonstrated
the equivalence between both illumination schemes and the potential
to use these scans as particle classifiers.

To compare these
two illumination schemes with respect to the background
noise, we analyzed two noise metrics corresponding to the local and
global fluctuations within each image. Local noise fluctuations quantified
the shot noise within the image, whereas global noise fluctuations
predominantly measured the speckle and background roughness contributions.
As a first step, we segmented all pixels within an image corresponding
to the background, i.e., excluding those counted as particles. Local
background noise was computed as the standard deviation within a 3
× 3 background pixel area. The choice of an interrogation area
significantly smaller than the diffraction limit minimized any speckle
or substrate roughness contributions. Global noise was calculated
as the standard deviation within a 51 × 51 background pixel area.Figurec shows the distribution
of local (pink) and global (purple) background noise from all frames
under the two illumination schemes, with the global background noise
at least 2-fold higher than the local one. As expected from a shot-noise-limited
measurement, both partially coherent schemes showed comparable local
background noise levels when illuminated at similar fluences. Similarly,
speckle and substrate roughness contributions increased the noise
level above shot noise, with slightly higher values for the RGG-based
illumination due to the presence of low spatial frequency components
that had not been effectively suppressed during the integration time
of the sensor.

In summary, for a partially coherent microscope,
lasers combined
with an RGG can perform just as well as LEDs and additionally deliver
higher fluences. This enables imaging of larger fields of view at
higher temporal resolutions, thereby increasing the overall throughput
of the imaging system. Given the equivalence of the two light sources
and the fact that LEDs have already been successfully implemented
to measure biological NPs such as EVs and single proteins, all subsequent results were performed with an
RGG-based laser as the illumination source.

To determine how the degree of partial
coherence affects particle detection SNR, we repeated the defocus
scan of the polydisperse sample under different coherence parameters,s, by varying the NAibut keeping
the detection NA fixed and imaging the exact same sample area.Figurea shows representative
zoomed-in regions containing all three NP species with their respective
ensemble defocus scan contrast curves. For these representative images,
we chose the focus position at each parametersthat
maximized the contrast for the smallest particles (20 nm AuNP), as
these were not the same for all particles or for different NAi. Specifically, the focus position of the
maximum negative contrast, indicated by the dotted vertical lines
inFigurea, shifted
to higher defocus positions as the degree of partial coherence increased.
Similarly, the amplitude of contrast oscillations in the defocus curves
decayed with increasings. To further validate our
experimental data, we developed an imaging model for the detection
of NPs as a function of defocus for partially coherent systems based
on interferometric detection in reflection geometry (seesection S1 and Figures S1–S3). For all
three NPs, the model and experiment showed excellent agreement.

coherence on single NP detection. (a) Left: Inline
holography images of two 20 nm AuNPs (blue triangle), a 40 nm AuNP
(orange triangle), and a 142 nm SiO2(green triangle).
The images were acquired at the focus position where the smallest
constituents, 20 nm AuNPs, exhibit the largest contrast, as indicated
by the blue vertical dashed lines in the right plots. Scale bars:

contrast defocus curves for each NP species. Colored solid lines (blue,
orange, green) and shaded regions indicate the experimental average
and plus/minus one standard deviation, whereas brown curves correspond
to simulation data (see S1). Increasing from the smallest to the largest
NAi, the particle counts of each NP species
are: 20 nm AuNPs (420, 428,404, 424, 249, 291), 40 nm AuNPs (249,
214,245, 183, 203, 179), and SiO2NPs (452, 1302,1601,
1409, 1582,1828). (b) Population-averaged values of maximum absolute
contrast plotted against the degree of spatial coherence. (c) Local
and global background noise as a function of the degree of spatial
coherence. The black region indicates the shot noise limit. (d) Population-averaged
SNR as a function of the degree of spatial coherence, retrieved by
dividing the population-averaged contrast shown in (b) by the global
noise shown in (c).

As expected from partially
coherent imaging systems,
ass(NAi) increased,
the optical
resolution also increased, while the speckle contrast, PSF ringing,
and substrate roughness contributionsmostly composed of high
spatial frequency componentsdecreased. In addition, the signal
contrast for each particle increased as a function ofs, before dropping slightly as NAiapproached
the value of the refractive index of the solution. We attribute this
latter drop in contrast to the increase in effective reflectivity
associated with including total internal reflection contributions
(seeS2.1 and Figure S4).

To evaluate
how the increase in particle contrast, together with
the reduction in background noise with increasingsvalues, translates to particle detection SNR, we first isolated
each contribution individually.Figureb shows the average contrast magnitude for all three
NP species, demonstrating at least a 2-fold enhancement compared to
the lowestsvalue evaluated. Notably, the smaller
the particle, the higher the contrast enhancement and its occurrence
at higher degrees of partial coherence. We partially attribute this
trend to the increase in resolution (seeS2.2).

For the noise component, we compared both the local and
global
background noise metrics (Figurec). The local background noise remained constant, as
expected from illumination at similar fluences for the different partially
coherent systems, with values within the range of a shot-noise-limited
measurement based solely on camera counts. In contrast, the global
noise level, which includes signals assigned to glass roughness contributions,
decreased approximately 2-fold as a result of the reduction of coherent
artifacts. We emphasize that the reduction in noise was independent
of NP sample type and defocus position. Moreover, the reduction in
noise also indicated that much of the signals attributed to the glass
roughness contributions largely stem from the coherent superposition
of scattering signals, i.e., from a strongly speckle-dominated signal.

We then computed the SNR as the ratio of the population average
particle contrast magnitude to the global background noise (Figured). The overall trend
showed that the SNR can be increased between 2- and 4-fold within
the range of partial coherence parameters tested, with an optimal
window within 0.7 < NAi< 1.3. It
should be emphasized that these enhancement factors underestimate
the true enhancement relative to the coherent case, typically associated
with widefield interferometric scattering microscopy (withs≪ 0.1). This is simply because coherent artifacts
degraded the image so severely (Figure, representative image, bottom left corner) that any
quantitative particle characterization was intractable.

Next, we repeated
the defocus scans as a function ofson a sample
containing H358 cell culture-derived EVs (Figure S7) to determine whether similar SNR enhancements
are expected with biological NPs. Here, the intrinsic size and refractive
index heterogeneity of EVs make them an ideal system for observing
general trends that extend to other biological NPs, especially relevant
when no a priori information is available for each NP. Specifically,
nanoparticle tracking analysis measured an average population diameter
of 124 ± 57 nm (seeFigure S7). Based on their size- and cargo-dependent refractive index (1.36–1.40) as well as physical dimensions, the optical
response of a fraction of EVs is expected to show similarities to
the 142 nm SiO2NP. However, the intrinsic size and refractive
index heterogeneity of EVs limits precise contrast predictions.Figurea plots the SNR distribution
of all single EVs detected for varying coherence parameters, with
the dashed-dotted lines on each distribution indicating the 95th percentile.
For the SNR calculation, we assumed that the optimal contrast had
a negative value for all particles. Similarly to synthetic NP assays,
increasingsled to SNR enhancements for the EV sample,
with the maximum occurring in the range of 0.7 < NAi< 1.3. From an ensemble perspective, an almost
4-fold enhancement was observed, with the contrast enhancement contributing
more than 60% to this increase (Figure S8). Nevertheless, we must point out that this metric corresponded
to a lower bound, as many EVs were not detected at lowersvalues simply because their SNR fell below the detection threshold.

the 95th percentile of the population. Increasing from the smallest
to the largest NAi, the counts of considered

(h) Contrast-defocus curves of the EVs marked in (f) and (g) at their
respective NAi. The vertical dashed lines
indicate the axial positions at which the images in (f) and (g) were
acquired.

To better estimate the range of
SNR enhancement
in this highly
heterogeneous NP system, we examined how the contrast varies as a
function ofsat the single-particle level, given
that the noise contributions remain invariant across particle types.Figureb shows four EVs,
with each zoomed-in image along a row corresponding to the focus position
that optimizes the signal contrast for a given degree of partial coherence.
These four EVs were selected on the basis of exhibiting low, intermediate,
and high contrast values as a way to indirectly show the heterogeneity
in possible size and refractive index within the full population of
EVs. In contrast to synthetic NPs (Figureb), EVs displayed a more complex contrast
dependence ons, including contrast inversions for
some particles. Here, we denote contrast inversions as a switch in
the sign of the largest magnitude signal extracted from a defocus
curve as a function of tuning the degree of partial coherence, not
to be confused with signal inversions occurring within the contrast
defocus scans. To monitor this contrast inversion,Figurec,d shows the maximum positive
and minimum negative contrast values for each EV, extracted from their
respective contrast defocus curves (Figure S9), with the dotted line marking the 95th percentile of the ensemble.
Except for the EV with the largest contrast magnitude (olive line),
all others underwent a signal contrast inversion: positive at lowsand negative at highs. This highlights
the complex role both the Gouy phase and the phase transfer function
play in modulating signal contrast at lower degrees of partial coherence.
Finally, we computed the enhancement as the absolute value of the
optimal contrast at eachs, normalized against the
optimal contrast at the lowest testeds, with values
ranging within 2- and 6-fold increase in the magnitude of the signal
contrast (Figuree).
Once again, these values underestimate the overall enhancement relative
to the coherent case, because of the highly detrimental coherent artifacts.
Nevertheless, these observations indicate that optimal results were
obtained for partially coherent systems within 0.7 < NAi< 1.3, not only because of the overall contrast
enhancement and accompanying reduction in background noise fluctuations,
but also because of their consistent sign of the contrast signal,
thus reducing ambiguity within the choice of focus position to optimally
image at.

A crucial step in single-particle-based sensing applications
aimed
at heterogeneous samples is the detection and subsequent characterization
of NP contrast signals, which are often only taken at a single focus
position. However, as shown inFigureb focus positions that maximize such signals strongly
depend on both the particle properties and thesparameter.
To illustrate how critical this scenario is in low-simaging systems,Figuref,g shows representative images of EVs immobilized on the
surface, taken at two different focus positions obtained from a defocus
scan, alongside the contrast defocus curves for a subset of EVs (Figureh). Each focus position
optimizes the contrast of a particular subset of EVs, indicated by
blue (Figuref) or
orange (Figureg)
arrows. Note that for the measurements performed at NAi= 0.5, when the contrast magnitude of the subset
marked in orange was maximized, the contrast of the subset marked
in blue approached a zero crossing, causing the SNR of some of these
EVs to fall below the detection threshold. This experiment serves
as an example that interpreting particle contrasts from experiments
performed at a single focus position warrants caution, as the measured
contrast may not be representative of a given particle species. However,
assincreased, this effect significantly reduced
as the distance between the two focus positions decreased and eventually
converged to within 10 nm.

These results lead to two different
approaches for characterizing
heterogeneous NP samples that depend on the degree of partial coherence.
If the degree of partial coherence is low, using a single focus position
may severely underestimate both the count and contrast of entire subpopulations
of NPs. Instead, either the system PSF should be engineered to make it insensitive to defocus, or defocus
scans should be measured, the latter offering potential advantages
in the form of richer information content that can be used as particle
classifiers. If the degree of partial
coherence is high, a single focus position may suffice, as the information
content about the particle properties within a contrast defocus decreases,
with all particle types tested tending to converge to a similar shape.

Finally, most interferometric-based microscopies leverage the intrinsic
shot noise-limited nature of detection through differential imaging
in the absence of sample drifts, whereby a continuously updated background
is subtracted from an ongoing set of images, combined with frame averaging,
to drastically improve the sensitivity limits of a single-shot acquisition.
To confirm that tuning the partial coherence also enhances the SNR
under this imaging modality, we chose a test assay ubiquitously encountered
in label-free protein detection and mass photometry: quantification
of the nonspecific binding of single proteins onto a glass coverslip
(Figurea). For this
assay, we used human thyroglobulin (TG), a 660 kDa dimeric protein
that spans 28 × 20 × 16 nm3according to the
fold-state crystal structure, with an
estimated refractive index of 1.5867. Based on mass-to-polarizability calibration for proteins, we estimate the signal contrast for TG to be
approximately 30× lower than that for a 20 nm AuNP, thereby requiring
differential imaging for its detection. We specifically performed
the assay on the same FOV at different degrees of partial coherence,
NAi= [0.1, 1.3], keeping the camera counts
the same, thereby ensuring equal photon statistics between experiments.
By observing the same FOV, we allowed the imaging system to mechanically
relax and thus minimized any significant lateral sample drifts. For
each imaging condition, the focus position was optimized to yield
the maximum absolute signal contrast of TG.

noise, and SNR of TG as a function of the degree of partial coherence.

with a kernel size of 55 pixels to reduce residual speckle and beam
profile inhomogeneities in the differential images. Inset: ensemble-averaged
PSF. Scale bars: 1 μm. Crosses indicate experimental
conditions under which it was not possible to detect TG.

Figureb
shows
representative normalized and differential images of the glass surface
with TG binding highlighted in the zoomed-in regions. Upon changing
from lower degrees of partial coherence to higher ones, a clear contrast
signal inversion and reduction in background noise were observed,
in agreement with the results from the extracellular vesicle assays.
The reduction in noise follows the reduction in speckle contrast contributions
that get imprinted into the differential imaging due to the presence
of minute sample drifts. All TG binding and unbinding events were
subsequently localized, and their respective normalized contrast distribution
and fraction of binding events to total particles are plotted inFigurec. No particles were
detected for NAi< 0.3, as they fell
below the detection threshold due to a combination of lower signal
contrast and higher background noise levels. Differences in the fraction
of binding events reflected the increase in false positives attributed
to the inclusion of residual speckle contributions with high structural
similarity to TG PSFs.Figured summarizes the signal contrast, background noise level,
and resulting SNR as a function of the degree of partial coherence
for the ensemble of TGs measured, with the inset showing the ensemble-averaged
PSFs at each measurement condition. Overall, these data show a trend
similar to synthetic and biological NPs, with the lowest SNR at low
NAi, a contrast inversion occurring between
NAi= 0.5 and 0.7, a maximum contrast
around NAi= 0.9, followed by a decrease
in signal contrast and a monotonic decay in background noise as NAiapproaches 1.3, where total internal reflection
contributions become significant. Lastly, from a signal contrast perspective,
the experimental observations are in full agreement with the expected
30-fold reduction in signal going from a 20 nm AuNP (30 × 10–3) to a single TG protein (1.4 × 10–3).

These results demonstrate that partially coherent systems
are also
compatible with differential-based imaging and offer SNR tuning similar
to that of larger NP systems. Despite the achieved sensitivity being
lower compared to specialized label-free protein detection systems,
our FOVs are orders of magnitude higher and involve the use of mechanically
oscillating RGG systems and cheap laser diodes with poor beam quality.
We believe that the sensitivity and throughput can be further improved
by engineering the illumination beam profile (seeFigure S10), increasing the camera frame rate, and enhancing
the speed of the rotating diffuser; the latter two reduce the effects
of mechanical drift or time-varying artifacts from the laser and RGG
system. As a more suitable solution for differential imaging applications,
we propose the use of high-intensity LED systems, as LEDs remove the
need for any rotating mechanical elements, offering better stability,
suppression of residual time-varying speckles from imperfect RGG synchronization
and laser mode hopping, and additional reduction of temporal coherence.

In this work, we showcased
a platform that
simultaneously tunes
and measures the degree of partial coherence, with the aim of quantifying
how this influences the detection sensitivity of single nanoparticles.
We further recapitulated the main experimental findings with an imaging
model for partially coherent systems. By characterizing the particle
signal at different focus positions and the background noise, we demonstrated
that a diode laser can achieve performance similar to that of an LED,
yet with the advantage of a higher available photon flux. Our results
on tuning the spatial coherence over a wide range of synthetic and
biological NPs show a consistent optimization of the SNR when the
coherence parametersfalls within a range of intermediate
values, corresponding to 0.7 < NAi<
1.3. In the case of biological particles, we verified that single
proteins can be enhanced compared with the coherent case due to a
synergistic combination of background noise reduction and signal contrast
enhancement.

With the defocus scans, we further showed the pivotal
role the
degree of partial coherence plays in modulating the signal contrast
response for different particle types. In the case of imaging systems
with a lowsparameter, the fact that there is no
unique focus position that optimizes the contrast for all particle
types within heterogeneous NP samples can lead to entire subsets of
NPs going undetected when optimizing the contrast for a specific NP
population. This highlights the importance of acquiring defocus scans
in these imaging systems because they provide valuable information
that can be exploited for sizing, classification, or sample tilt compensation. One way to retrieve the axial information, besides time-consuming
defocus scans, is to retrieve the phase and perform digital propagation,
for instance, by solving the Transport-of-Intensity equation or conducting these measurements with an off-axis
holography configuration. Alternatively, if throughput and sensitivity
are paramount, imaging systems with high degrees of partial coherence
should be preferred.

Lastly, we have demonstrated that partial
coherence imaging is
compatible with differential-based detection, thereby promising to
increase the throughput of assays, in terms of the total FOV imaged,
that rely on the quantification of spatially varying heterogeneous
signals that fall below the signal levels of the static background,
which can either be in the form of proteins, nucleic acids, lipid
nanoparticles, or different charge states. All in all, we believe
our work paves the way toward democratizing how inline holographic
approaches based on interferometric detection can deliver both high
sensitivity and throughput without the need for beam scanning solutions.

The custom-built partially coherent digital
holographic optical system was based on a common-path microscope operating
in reflection, whereby the illumination and imaging arms were separated
by a single 50:50 beamsplitter plate (BSW27, Thorlabs). The setup
is outlined inFiguree and detailed schematic shown inFigure S6together with a list of all optical components inTable S1. Partially coherent illumination was achieved by
two approaches: focusing a 465 nm laser beam (LDM-465-3000-C, Lasertack)
on a rotating ground glass (RGG) diffuser (DG20-1500, Thorlabs) or
using a 455 nm LED (M455F3, Thorlabs). For the first option, the laser
was coupled out of a single-mode fiber (P1-460A-FC-2, Thorlabs) by
a 0.1 NA objective (Olympus UPlan FLN). A plano-convex lens (LA1986,
Thorlabs) focused the light on the RGG, which was driven at 600 rpm
by a stepper motor (42BYG Stepper Motor, Makeblock). The RGG introduced
a power loss of 38%. After the RGG, a 0.4 NA objective (Olympus PlanN)
collected the diverging beam. The laser beam with reduced coherence
was coupled into a multimode fiber (FT600EMT, Thorlabs) by a 0.3 NA
objective (Olympus UPlan FLN) with an overall coupling efficiency
of 90%. Both options for partially coherent light sources could be
coupled into the inline holography system by a 0.25 NA aspheric lens
(C220TMD-A, Thorlabs). A relay system composed of two plano-convex
lenses (LA1131 and LA1509-A, Thorlabs) allowed access to the back
focal plane, in which an adjustable iris was placed to control the
NAi. The image plane was relay-imaged
onto the sample plane via a 3:4 imaging system composed of two plano-convex
lenses (AC508-400-A-ML and AC508-300-A, Thorlabs) and a 1.42 oil immersion
objective (UPLXAPO 60×, Olympus). The flat-top illumination measured
a diameter of 108 μm. In terms of total available photon flux
at the same partially coherent parameters for both illumination sources,
the RGG system delivered up to 83 mW (8.94 μW/μm2) compared to 7.9 mW for the LED (0.85 μW/μm2) for the LED system. This represents more than an order of magnitude
higher photon flux for the RGG system. The sample plane was relay-imaged
using the same objective (UPLXAPO 60×, Olympus) and lens (AC508-300-A,
Thorlabs) as those used for illumination. To reduce the area averaged
per pixel to 45 × 45 nm, a 50:50 beamsplitter directed a portion
of the collected light into a 2:1 relay system composed of two plano-convex
lenses (AC508-100-A-ML and AC508-200-A-ML, Thorlabs), which imaged
the light onto a CMOS camera (pixel size: 9 μm; BFS-U3-17S7M-C,
USB 3.1 Blackfly S, Teledyne). The sensor area was around half the
size of the image plane at that position, which restricted the detected
FOV to 72 × 50  μm. This imaging system resulted
in a 200× magnification. A flip mirror was mounted before the
2:1 relay system, which, when flipped up, guided the light through
a plano-convex lens (LA1608-75-A, Thorlabs). Together with the AC508-300-A
lens, the last lens relayed images of the back focal plane, which
is located inside the objective, onto a second camera (GS3-U3-23S6M,
Grasshopper3). The sample focus position was encoded and stabilized
using the back reflection from a 670 nm beam (CPS670F, Thorlabs) confocally
illuminating the sample. Specifically, the diameter of the reflected
beam was used as a feedback parameter in a proportional-integral-derivative
loop, making it insensitive to beam-pointing instabilities. The sample
was mounted on a motorized XY microstage (Mad City Laboratories) equipped
with linear encoders and a Z nanopositioner stage (Nano-Z200, Mad
City Laboratories).

During acquisition,
a field of view
of 46 × 46μm2corresponding
to an area of 1024 × 1024 camera pixels2was recorded
with an exposure time of 19.6 ms and a fixed frame rate of 50 Hz.
To minimize data load and increase the signal-to-noise ratio, data
were saved in the form of 20 time-averaged frames, leading to an effective
time resolution of 2.5 Hz. The rotation speed of the diffuser was
set to 600 rpm and synchronized with the camera frame rate, such that
each effective time-averaged frame would include the average of four
revolutions. For all synthetic and biological NP experiments, we measured
a power at the sample of approximately 6.5 mW, equivalent to an irradiance
of 0.7 μW/μm2.

For the experiments with synthetic
NPs, we used 142 nm SiO2NPs (SiO2-R-L3205-23/1,
Microparticles GmbH), 40 nm AuNPs (AuXR40, nanoComposix), and 20 nm
AuNPs (EM.STP20, BBI Solutions). All nanoparticles were suspended
in deionized water to a concentration of 8 pM for SiO2and
40 nm AuNPs, and 16 pM for 20 nm AuNPs. Before the NP sample was introduced
onto the glass surface, each glass coverslip was cleaned with isopropanol
and rinsed with deionized water. To locate the approximate focal position,
50 μL of deionized water was first deposited on the coverslip.
NPs were then sequentially added by pipetting 1 μL of each stock
solution onto the coverslip. After each addition, 5–10 μL
of phosphate-buffered saline was introduced to favor nonspecific binding
of the NPs to the glass surface due to the reduction of the Debye
screening length. The coverslip was then rinsed with deionized water
to remove excess particles. Before the measurements were started,
an additional 50 μL of deionized water was added to prevent
drying during data acquisition.

The human lung cancer
cell line H358 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC: CRL-5807). Cells were cultured in RPMI (ATCC formulation, Gibco
A01491) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco 10270-106)
1% Pen/Strep (Gibco 15140-122) at 37◦C in 5% CO2. For EV isolation, cells were first detached with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA
(Gibco, 25200-056), centrifuged at 700 ×gfor
7 min, and the cell pellet was washed with PBS (Gibco, 10010–015).
Next, 12× T150 flasks were each plated with 2.5 million H358
cells in 20 mL of RPMI, including 10% EV-depleted FBS (Gibco, A27208-01)
and 1% Pen/Strep. After culturing for 72 h to 60–70% confluency,
the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1500 ×gfor 10 min, then at 10,000 ×gfor
10 min at 4 °C to remove floating cells or large debris. The
supernatant was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal
filter (MWCO = 50 kDa, Merck UFC905096) at 5000 ×gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The concentrated sample was then purified
via a size-exclusion chromatography column according to the manufacturer’s
specifications (Izon, qEV1 70 nm). Specifically, for each 1 mL of
isolated EV sample, 10 mL of PBS were added as the elution volume,
from which the first 4.7 mL were discarded and the following 4 mL
were collected as the EV fraction. The EV fraction was concentrated
with the Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters and afterward supplemented
with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, 87786)
before storing at −80 °C until further use.

EVs
were lysed in 10× RIPA lysis buffer (Merck 20-188) for Western
blot analysis to confirm the characteristic EV biomarkers (CD9, CD63,
and TSG101) and the degree of purity using a non-EV marker (GRP94).
The blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD9
(1:500 dilution, Thermo, 10626D), anti-CD63 (1:1000 dilution, Boster,
M01080-1), anti-TSG101 (1:1000 dilution, Biorbyt, ORB1564135), and
anti-GRP94 (1:1000 dilution, FineTest, FNab03665). Chemiluminescence
was detected using an iBright CL1500 system (Thermo Scientific A44240)
with SuperSignal West Pico Plus Chemiluminescence Substrate (Thermo
Scientific 34277) and SuperSignal West Atto Ultimate Sensitivity Substrate
(Thermo Scientific A38555). The concentration and mean size of the
EVs were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis using Zetaview
(Particle Metrix) and found to be 2.8 × 1010particles/mL
and 124.4 nm, respectively.

Each acquired frame
was normalized
by the median pixel value to correct for shot-to-shot power fluctuations.
Sample-independent static contributions were consequently removed
by flat-fielding. For this, the median image was computed from 16
different lateral positions at the same focus. Each frame was then
divided by the median image computed for the given focus.

The first step in particle localization
consisted of creating SNR-enhanced images from the normalized flat-field
images. For this, the normalized images were binned 2 × 2. Then,
the root mean square of the background was computed by including pixels
with values smaller than three times the global standard deviation.
The standard deviation was estimated from the median absolute deviation.
An SNR-enhanced image was created by dividing the binned images by
the RMS of the respective background pixels.

All pixels with
absolute values larger than 0.2 in the SNR-enhanced image were used
as initial guesses for particle localization, provided they additionally
fulfilled the requirement of being the local extrema within a 9 ×
9 pixel window. These guesses were verified using Trackpy version
0.6.4 and a radial symmetry fit. In the next step, Trackpy version
0.6.4 was used to link the particles at different axial positions.
The particle guesses were further considered under the condition that
they could be linked along a single trajectory over a distance of
1.5 μm, with a memory of zero and a search range of 1.75.

TG
(Merck, T1001) was resuspended at 1 mg/mL in water and passed through
a 10,000 kDa MWCO filter to remove aggregates. Experiments were performed
in a microwell, where a solution of 10 nM TG in PBS was injected prior
to imaging. During the acquisition of TG data, a field of view of
46 × 46  μm2corresponding to an area
of 1024 × 1024 camera pixels, was recorded with an exposure time
of 4.62 ms and a fixed frame rate of 200 Hz. To minimize data load
and increase the signal-to-noise ratio, data were saved in the form
of 20 time-averaged frames, leading to an effective time resolution
of 10 Hz, which was synchronized to the rotation speed of the diffuser
to match a single revolution. For all TG experiments, we recorded
500 averaged frames (50 s) with a power at the sample of approximately
26 mW, equivalent to an irradiance of 2.8 μW/μm2.

withN= 50 representing
the number of frames averaged. In total, each image in Δicorresponds to effectively averaging 1000
raw camera frames (effective frame rate of 0.2 Hz). For the detection
of single binding and unbinding events, no further image processing
other than a flat-field correction and a 2D spatial median filter
with kernel sizeM= 55 pixels was used to remove
illumination inhomogeneities caused by residual speckle, changes in
laser mode, and beam-pointing instabilities. Only detection events
with track lengths ≥30 time points were considered for further
analysis.
