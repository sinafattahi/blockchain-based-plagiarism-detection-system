To investigate alteration in pulsatile trabecular meshwork (TM) motion in normal tension glaucoma (NTG) compared with healthy controls and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients.

This cross-sectional study included 15 healthy individuals, 14 NTG patients and 15 POAG patients with asymmetric visual field defects (VFD). Eyes were categorised as mild-to-moderate VFD (GI) or severe VFD (GII). A custom-designed phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography system was used to assess TM motion in temporal and nasal regions. Parameters analysed included maximum velocity (MV) and cumulative displacement (CDisp).

Mean deviation was comparable between NTG and POAG in GI eyes (p=0.944), and intraocular pressure post-treatment in POAG was similar to NTG (p=0.066). MV and CDisp in NTG were significantly lower than in healthy controls (p<0.001) but higher than in POAG (p<0.001). In POAG, temporal MV, nasal CDisp and temporal CDisp were significantly higher in GI than in GII eyes (p=0.002, 0.025 and 0.038). In NTG, no significant differences in MV or CDisp were observed between GI and GII eyes (p>0.05).

Pulsatile TM motion is reduced in NTG compared with healthy individuals but remains higher than in POAG. Unlike POAG, NTG shows no asymmetry in TM motion between eyes with varying VFD severity, suggesting additional factors beyond TM biomechanics contribute to NTG progression.

Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is prevalent in Asia. Besides intraocular pressure (IOP), many other factors, such as systemic factors, low cerebrospinal fluid pressure and biomechanical abnormalities of ocular tissue involved in the pathologies of NTG. It was assumed that trabecular meshwork, a specialised viscoelastic tissue, influences the IOP but has not been studied in NTG.

Our study quantified the trabecular meshwork (TM) motion by the phase-sensitive OCT in NTG, primary open-angle glaucoma and normal subjects. TM biomechanical properties directly regulate the aqueous humour drainage, which might be more relevant to NTG. We, for the first time, validate the TM elastic properties change in NTG.

Our study provides novel insights into the role of TM biomechanics in NTG. TM motion might be a valuable indicator for NTG diagnosis and management.

Glaucoma, characterised by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and corresponding visual field loss, is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) has long been recognised as a major risk factor for glaucoma development.1 2However, a significant proportion of individuals diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) exhibit IOP levels within the normal range, particularly in Asian populations.3 4This subset of glaucoma is referred to as normal tension glaucoma (NTG), making it a critical area of study.

The trabecular meshwork (TM) is a specialised viscoelastic tissue. It plays a critical role in maintaining IOP homeostasis by regulating aqueous humour outflow.12 13Alterations in TM biomechanics, such as increased stiffness or reduced motion, may contribute to impaired aqueous outflow and IOP dysregulation in some NTG, which has never been studied previously.

To bridge this knowledge, we use our lab-built phenotype phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PhS-OCT) to quantify the TM motion, a reflection of TM biomechanical properties, in eyes with NTG. We seek to elucidate the role of TM biomechanics in NTG pathogenesis and provide new insights into its management.

This cross-sectional study was conducted at Beijing Tongren Hospital between January and December 2020. Patient and the public were not involved in this research.

A total of 44 participants were enrolled, including 15 healthy individuals, 14 patients newly diagnosed with NTG and 15 patients with POAG who were naïve to pressure-lowering medication. The diagnosis of glaucoma was based on established criteria,3 6including open anterior angles on gonioscopy, glaucomatous optic neuropathy assessed by disc photographs (eg, vertical cup/disc ratio >0.7 or asymmetry greater than 0.2; retinal nerve fibre layer less than 0.1, or the detection of localised or diffuse defects in retinal nerve fibre layer) and repeatable glaucomatous visual field defects (VFD) (eg, Glaucoma Hemifield Test that fall outside normal limits, a pattern SD with a p value of less than 0.05, the presence of three or more contiguous points demonstrating depression with a probability p value less than 5%, in addition to at least one point with a probability p value of less than 1% in the pattern deviation plot). POAG was defined by untreated IOP>21 mm Hg, while NTG was characterised by the median untreated IOP remaining below 21 mm Hg, as evidenced by three distinct assessments, with no individual reading surpassing 21 mm Hg during 24-hour IOP monitoring. All glaucoma patients exhibited asymmetric VFD, with one eye classified as mild-to-moderate VFD (GI; mean deviation (MD) ranging from −12 dB to 0 dB) and the contralateral eye as severe VFD (GII; MD <−15 dB). Healthy participants had no ocular diseases other than mild myopia (≤−3.0 dioptres) or dry eye. Exclusion criteria included a history of ocular trauma or surgery, high myopia, older than 60 years old and younger than 35 years old, diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

All participants underwent comprehensive ocular assessments, including medical history review, best corrected visual acuity, refraction, slit-lamp examination and stereoscopic optic disc imaging. IOP was measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). Axial length and anterior chamber depth were assessed with the IOL-Master 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Central corneal thickness and biomechanically corrected IOP were evaluated using Corneal Visualisation Scheimpflug Technology. Blood pressure (BP) was recorded with an automatic BP monitor (OMRON Heem-907).

Glaucoma patients underwent standard automated perimetry using a Humphrey Field Analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Reliable tests were defined as having fixation losses, false-positive rates and false-negative rates ≤20%. NTG patients participated in 24-hour IOP monitoring, with measurements taken at seven time points using GAT: 02:00, 06:00, 08:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00 and 22:00 PM.

TM motion was assessed using a custom-designed PhS-OCT system, which combines a spectral-domain OCT system, a digital pulsimeter and an external control unit. PhS-OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique based on spectral-domain OCT configuration. Unlike commercial OCT we use in clinic, the PhS-OCT system was equipped with an algorithm to extract the phase signal from the acquired time-resolved OCT datasets. Phase signal is ultra-sensitive to tissue motion, reaching the level of nm/s. The details of the PhS-OCT setup and the phase information extraction algorithm were described previously.14The system captures real-time, pulse-dependent TM motion with nanometre-level sensitivity. Imaging was performed in the nasal and temporal regions of the TM by a skilled investigator (CX). Two parameters were analysed by another experienced investigator (QS) blind to the diagnosis of participants: maximum velocity (MV), defined as the peak value on the velocity waveform and cumulative displacement (CDisp), calculated as the integral of the velocity waveform over one cardiac cycle. The MV and CDisp associated with the pulsatile motion of TM were subsequently quantified (figure 1).

Data were analysed using SPSS V.20.0 (SPSS). Continuous variables are expressed as mean±SD, and categorical variables as frequencies (%). Differences in TM motion parameters among groups were assessed using analysis of variance or least significant difference tests. Paired t-tests were used to compare TM motion between eyes within the same individual. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between TM motion parameters and ocular and systemic variables. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The study included 15 healthy individuals, 14 NTG patients and 15 POAG patients. Baseline characteristics are summarised intable 1. In the NTG group, IOP was similar between two eyes (p=0.068). In the POAG group, IOP was initially significantly higher in GII eyes compared with GI eyes (p<0.001). Following treatment with bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5% (BIM/TIM; Ganfort), IOP in POAG patients decreased to levels comparable to NTG and healthy controls (p=0.066). In healthy individuals, the right eye was assigned to the GI eyes as in glaucomatous groups.

The nasal and temporal MV and CDisp in treatment-naïve POAG GI eyes were measured as 15.1±1.5 µm/s, 13.0±1.5 µm/s, 0.234±0.015 µm and 0.186±0.016 µm, respectively. Post-treatment measurements revealed no statistically significant differences in these parameters (p=0.475, 0.987, 0.315 and 0.809). In comparison, NTG exhibited significantly lower MV and CDisp than healthy controls (p<0.001), whereas TM motion parameters in NTG were higher than those in POAG (p<0.001) (table 2,figure 2).

All p value of all the parameters, both MV and CDisp, for comparison between two groups, such as healthy versus POAG, or POAG versus NTG, or NTG versus POAG, were less than 0.001.

Logistic regression analysis showed no significant relationship between TM motion parameters and IOP, heartbeat and mean arterial pressure in individual groups (all p>0.05).

In the POAG cohort, the temporal MV and nasal and temporal CDisp of GII eyes were quantified at 11.2±0.6 µm/s, 0.211±0.019 µm and 0.174±0.020 µm, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those observed in GI eyes (p=0.002, 0.025 and 0.038, respectively). In contrast, the nasal MV in GII eyes (14.2±1.0 µm/s) did not exhibit a statistically significant difference compared with GI eyes (p=0.134). In the NTG cohort, the nasal and temporal MV in GII eyes were measured at 19.5±1.3 µm/s and 18.1±1.4 µm/s, respectively, while the corresponding CDisp values were 0.259±0.013 µm and 0.226±0.027 µm. No statistically significant differences were observed between GII and GI eyes for any of these parameters (p=0.372, 0.812, 0.4673 and 0.376, respectively).

NTG, characterised by glaucomatous cupping of the optic disc and VFD in the absence of elevated IOP, presents a unique challenge in understanding its pathogenesis. Unlike POAG, NTG lacks the hallmark of elevated IOP, prompting investigations into alternative mechanisms. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including ischaemic damage to the optic nerve, biomechanical abnormalities in ocular tissues such as the lamina cribrosa, and imbalances in translaminar cribrosa pressure.15 16However, the role of aqueous humour dynamics and TM function in NTG has received comparatively less attention.

Current evidence suggests that IOP reduction remains the most effective treatment for NTG.17Nevertheless, the extent to which IOP contributes to NTG pathogenesis remains unclear. Early studies reported no significant differences in aqueous outflow facility between NTG patients and healthy controls, yet over 50% of NTG patients exhibited an outflow facility below 0.2 µL/min/mm Hg.9Another study found that outflow facility in NTG patients typically ranged from 0.15 to 0.19 µL/min/mm Hg.10By integrating assessments of outflow facility, diurnal IOP variation and water drinking tests, researchers observed that NTG patients with abnormal aqueous humour dynamics experienced greater progression of VFD and visual sensitivity loss, despite normal IOP levels.10These findings suggest that abnormalities in aqueous outflow may contribute to NTG progression. Furthermore, clinical observations, including those by Yamazakiet al,18indicate that some NTG patients may develop elevated IOP over time, highlighting the dynamic nature of IOP homeostasis in NTG.

In this study, we matched the normal, NTG and POAG patients in terms of age, heart rate and mean arterial pressure, which potentially correlate with TM motion. This study reaffirms that TM motion is diminished in POAG, with further reduction observed as disease severity progresses. Despite significant IOP reduction following bimatoprost/timolol treatment, TM motion in POAG patients showed minimal change, suggesting that intrinsic alterations in TM biomechanics underlie IOP elevation in POAG. These results also indicate that TM motion is more markedly impaired in POAG eyes with advanced visual field loss, suggesting a progressive decline in TM biomechanical function associated with disease severity in POAG, potentially contributing to impaired aqueous humour outflow and elevated IOP.

In NTG, our findings represent the first clinical evidence of reduced TM motion, although less pronounced than in POAG. After controlling for confounding variables such as IOP, heart rate, BP and age, NTG patients exhibited significantly lower TM motion compared with healthy controls. This reduction in TM motion aligns with observed dysregulation of aqueous outflow and IOP homeostasis in NTG. While POAG exhibits a progressive decline in TM motion associated with disease severity, the lack of asymmetry in TM motion suggests that factors other than TM biomechanics, such as systemic vascular dysregulation or lamina cribrosa abnormalities, may play a more prominent role in NTG progression.

These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of TM biomechanics in glaucoma pathogenesis and highlight the potential for TM motion assessment as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in glaucoma management. Future studies should investigate the long-term dynamics of TM motion and its relationship to disease progression in both POAG and NTG in a prospective cohort.

This study has several limitations. First, the use of pressure-lowering medications in POAG patients may have influenced aqueous outflow dynamics, although no significant changes in TM motion were observed post-treatment. Second, the segmental nature of aqueous humour drainage suggests that TM motion may vary across different quadrants; however, this study was limited to the nasal and temporal regions. Finally, the relatively small sample size necessitates further research with larger cohorts to validate these findings.

In conclusion, this study evidenced that the dysfunction in the regulation of aqueous outflow also occurs in NTG. Future studies should explore long-term TM motion dynamics and its relationship to disease progression in NTG and POAG in a prospective study.
