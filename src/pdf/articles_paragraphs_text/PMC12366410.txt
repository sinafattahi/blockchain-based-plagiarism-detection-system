Common beans (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) are a nutritionally valuable crop with high levels of bioactive compounds, including phenolics with antioxidant and antibacterial properties. However, the functional potential of local Chilean landraces remains underexplored. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can influence plant metabolism, enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites. This study evaluates the effect of PGPB (Bacillus proteolyticusCyn1,Bacillus safensisCyn2, and their consortium) on the total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of extracts from the Chilean landrace ‘Sapito’. For this, ‘Sapito’ bean seeds were inoculated with individual PGPB strains and their consortium and cultivated under field conditions. Extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons were obtained using water, ethanol, and acetone. TPC was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method, antioxidant activity was assessed via DPPH, ABTS, H₂O₂ scavenging, ferrous ion chelation, and FRAP assays, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through agar diffusion, growth inhibition, and cell viability assays against Gram positiveBacillus cereusand Gram negativePseudomonas putida. PGPB inoculation significantly influenced TPC, with consortium-treated seeds accumulating higher phenolic content in aqueous extracts (95.9 ± 27.8 mg GAE/100 g dry seed). Antioxidant activity varied across treatments and solvents, with ethanolic and acetone extracts displaying the highest radical scavenging activities. Antibacterial assays revealed that ethanolic seed coat extracts exhibited stronger inhibition againstB. cereus. In conclusion, this is the first study evaluating the impact of PGPB on the functional properties of a Chilean common bean landrace. The findings highlight the potential of microbial inoculation to enhance phenolic accumulation and bioactivity, supporting sustainable agriculture, food security, and germplasm conservation in the face of climate change.

Food security and hunger are the two main aspects considered in the target 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have remained largely unchanged in recent years, and are above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels [1]. This situation is expected to worsen in the coming years due to the advancement of climate change in regions that are more vulnerable to extreme weather events, leading to decreased yields and reduced quality of cultivars [2]. However, much of the research in the past decade related to the SDGs has focused on agricultural efficiency and land use changes, significantly overshadowing studies on the effects of climate change on crops intended for human consumption [3]. Climate change is a multi-causal phenomenon that affects plants in various ways: the average increase in temperatures can limit photosynthesis by affecting plant metabolism [4], recurrent droughts in Mediterranean regions require improved irrigation system to prevent yield losses [5], and finally, soil salinity negatively impacts germination and early growth in plants by forcing an overproduction of osmolytes to avoid cellular dehydration [6], inducing toxicity levels in plant cells [7]. To address these issues, selecting and cultivating varieties tolerant to abiotic stress is a strategy for preserving food quality in the context of climate change.

Phaseolus vulgarisL. is one of the most widely cultivated and distributed legume species in the world, with a planted area of ~ 36.8 million hectares and a production of ~ 28.4 million tons yearly [1]. It is valued for its role in soil nitrification and its high content of dietary fiber and plant proteins. The plant is native to the Americas, where two main genetic pools are identified: the Mesoamerican and Andean. Within the Andean pool, the Chilean race stands out for its extensive genetic diversity, with over 200 local varieties planted from Arica (18°28′ S −70°19′ W) to Chiloe Island (43°06′ S −73°36′ W) along to proximately 3.200 km [8,9]. Despite this, the production of Chilean local common beans has largely been related to small farmers due to a shift in preference towards more profitable crops and a lower interest in their consumption among lower economic strata in society [10]. Beans have been characterized as a remarkable source of protein, dietary fiber, low concentrations of saturated fats, among others, at the same time they have been valued for their high content of active compounds such as tannins, flavonoids, phenols and anthocyanins, which have been strongly related to the antioxidant potential in this food, which is associated with health benefits [11–13]. The content and accumulation of these compounds may vary depending on the landrace consumed [14]. Some Chilean landraces have been reported to contain ~ 20–30% proteins and exhibit abundant pods and seeds, which is of interest in genetic improvement programs [15]. Additionally, the estimation of phenolic profiles in the Chilean landraces is quite recent, focusing on the identification and evaluation of bioactivities from leaves, pods, and seeds [14,16,17] reporting that the presence of these bioactive compounds decreases after cooking. In a more extensive review by Rodríguez et al., [18], the presence of certain bioactive compounds in Chilean beans are associated with their potential benefits in preventing cardiovascular diseases in humans.

On another hand, plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) can be free-living in the soil or associated with the plant root system. The beneficial effects of PGPB on crop performance are widely recognized, including providing resistance to pathogens, nitrogen fixation, production of siderophores for mineral absorption, phytohormones and antioxidant compounds synthesis, among others; features that enhance soil health and promote plant development [19–21]. Some PGPB may form biofilms during colonization on roots, creating a microenvironment that protects these structures from abiotic stress, promotes nutrient acquisition by recycling them in this environment, improves resistance against pathogens by isolating them or producing antibiotics, and helps tolerate abiotic stress [22]. Additionally, their role in controlling root homeostasis has been observed by regulating the state of diffusion barriers through suberization and the formation of Casparian bands [23].

Among PGPB, bacteria of the genusBacillusare of increasing interest due to their unique biotechnological properties, such as the synthesis of secondary metabolites and spore formation, which allow them to survive abiotic stresses. The action of these bacteria has been reported to mitigate the harmful effects of salinity and contribute to plant growth promotion, phosphate absorption, and preservation of photosynthetic pigments under saline conditions [24]. The presence of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase in PGPB helps degrade ACC, a precursor of the ethylene metabolic pathway, produced under abiotic stress, mainly salinity stress [25]. Some strains might also possess thermotolerant potential, which helps mitigate heat stress by secreting polysaccharides, forming biofilms on root nodes, and promoting the synthesis of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and heat shock proteins to prevent cell damage due to high temperatures [26]. Gupta & Pandey, [27] documented the use of PGPB in a consortium capable of buffering the effects of salinity on germination, shoot and root length, water content, and the accumulation of pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids by downregulating ethylene levels through enhanced ACC deaminase activity, thereby reducing oxidative stress. Additionally, the application of PGPB in consortia increased the phenolic content of seeds and fostered the antioxidant activity of defensive enzymes, as well as promoting greater nutrient absorption by improving root system architecture [28].

Our present study aims to evaluate the impact of PGPB, applied individually and as a consortium, on the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the bioactive metabolites extracted from the seed coat and cotyledon of the native Chilean common bean seeds, specifically of the landrace ‘Sapito’. This work explores the potential of PGPB to enhance the production and bioactivity of these metabolites, offering a sustainable approach to improve crop quality and functionality. By investigating the synergistic effects of PGPB and the genetic potential of the ‘Sapito’ landrace, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of plant–microbe interactions and their role in enhancing functional properties of common bean landraces seeds through PGPB inoculation.

Seeds ofP. vulgarisL. from local varieties ‘Sapito’ were provided and collected from the Centro de Estudios en Alimentos Procesados (CEAP), Talca, Chile, harvested in the 2021–2022 season and stored at 4 °C in a cold storage until use. Inoculum of the PGPBBacillus proteolyticusCyn1 andBacillus safensisCyn2 were prepared both individually and in combination the bean seeds. These PGP bacteria were previously isolated according to the protocol described by [29]. To validate their use as bioinoculants with minimal risk, the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of both strains were determined using the agar diffusion method described by Roy et al. (2020) [30], with slight modifications. Four broad-spectrum antibiotic discs kits from Himedia (Maharashtra, India) were employed, each comprising six different antibiotics: Hexa G-minus 2: Ceftazidime (CAZ, 30 µg), Ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 µg), Amikacin (AK, 30 µg), Nitrofurantoin (NIT, 300 µg), Netilmicin sulfate (NET, 30 µg), and Nalidixic acid (NAL, 30 µg). Hexa G-minus 11: Amikacin (AK, 30 µg), Ampicillin (AMP, 10 µg), Ampicillin/Sulbactam (A/S, 10:10 µg), Ceftriaxone (CTR, 30 µg), Ofloxacin (OF, 5 µg), and Ticarcillin/Clavulanic acid (TCC, 75:10 µg). Hexa G-plus 15: Ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 µg), Gentamicin (GEN, 10 µg), Linezolid (LZ, 30 µg), Penicillin G (P, 10 µg), Streptomycin (S, 10 µg), and Vancomycin (VA, 30 µg). Hexa G-plus 2: Penicillin G (P, 10 units), Clindamycin (CD, 2 µg), Co-trimoxazole (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim, COT, 27.75:1.25 µg), Erythromycin (E, 15 µg), Vancomycin (VA, 30 µg), and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (A/S, 10:10 µg).

L-Ascorbic acid, potassium persulfate, iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate, ABTS (2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). The Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) kit was purchased from HiMedia Laboratories (Maharashtra, India). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was obtained from Comercial Vimaroni S.A. (Quilpué, Chile) and ferredoxin ((3-(2-Pyridyl)−5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)−1,2,4-triazine) sodium salt) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, USA). As for the solvents, absolute ethanol was obtained from Winkler Ltd (Santiago, Chile) and acetone from Scharlab S.L. (Barcelona, Spain). All chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade. The bacteria were cultured in Nutrient Broth (NB) medium (Difco™, New Jersey, USA) and Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) medium (HiMedia, Maharashtra, India). LIVE/DEAD BacLight™ kit was acquired from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Massachusetts, USA).

Disinfection and bacterization of seeds will be carried out according to the method described by Meza et al. with modifications [29]. Two hundred seeds were initially subjected to intermittent washing with a solution of detergent and 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution for 5 min each, followed by rinsing with distilled water. Once disinfected, the seeds were placed in a laminar flow hood where they were washed with detergent again followed by 1% and 3% NaClO treatment for 5 and 3 min, respectively. Between each step, the seeds have been washed with distilled water. The seeds were then placed in sterile glass jars with sterile hygroscopic cotton and inoculated with the PGP bacterial culture (logarithmic phase, ~108CFU mL−1; bacterial culture: distilled water = 1:10 v/v)B. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2, both individually and in combination to form a consortium. The jars were kept in the dark at 26 °C until seedlings emerged. At this phase, plant–bacteria association through root colonization was observed using confocal microscopy. Prior to observation, seedlings were gently rinsed with sterile distilled water to remove loosely attached cells. Bacterial cells were stained using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight™ kit, which labels viable cells with SYTO 9 (excitation/emission 485 nm/498 nm) and cells with compromised membranes with propidium iodide (PI; excitation/emission 535 nm/617 nm). Fluorescence imaging was performed with a Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). For this study, the focus was placed on the visualization of viable cells adhering to the root surfaces.

Subsequently, a week-grown seedlings were transferred to a cultivation tray where they were planted in a 1:1 mixture of sandy soil and peat for 3 days to allow root adaptation to the substrate, before being moved to open field conditions. After the adaptation phase and prior to transplanting to the field, to evaluate the persistence of the PGP bacteria in the treatments, spore germination was monitored following the method described by Cabrera-Martínez et al. [31], with modifications. Spore growth was assessed by selecting three seedlings per treatment from the previously described experiment. A 2.0 ± 0.1 g portion of root-associated soil was suspended in 20 mL of sterile distilled water. The samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 60 min, followed by immediate immersion in ice to induce thermal shock. Liquid LB cultures were prepared and inoculated with 1% (v/v) of the treated soil solution to promote spore germination and incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for 16 h. Culture absorbance was measured at 590 nm using a FLEXA-200HT microplate reader (Allsheng, Hangzhou, China). All cultures were performed in triplicate, and the absorbance value of the uninoculated medium was subtracted as a blank.

Local bean landraces were planted during the Chilean summer season (2022–2023) in an experimental site located on the banks of the Mataquito River, in the municipality of Curepto, Maule Region, Chile (34° 59′ 24″ S, 72° 1′ 1″ W), at 16 m above sea level and 15 km from the coast. A randomized block experimental design was used, with random distribution of the treated rows within each block. From the seedlings obtained in the previous section, 10 seedlings were transplanted into each treatment row, with a spacing of 15 cm between plants, 30 cm between rows, and 30 cm between rows and transit spaces, resulting in the following experimental sets: set 1 of 10 plants, control seedlings (germinated without PGPB inoculum); set 2 of a total 20 plants, seedlings germinated usingB. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2 individually; and set 3 of 10 plants, seedlings germinated using the consortium ofB. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2. The experimental soil unit consisted of a 4 m² area per block, each containing approximately 40 plants distributed according to the described experimental groups (set 1, set 2, and set 3). The determination of macro/micronutrients, pH, and electrical conductivity will be carried out using the standardized method by Sadzawka et al. (2007) [32]. For the determination of metals in soil, the methodology described by Tapia et al. [33] was followed. Soil samples were dried at 105 °C, and 0.5 g of each representative sample was digested in a Teflon beaker with 50 mL of an HF–HNO₃ mixture (2:1). The solution was heated under a fume hood at 120 °C with constant stirring until almost dry. The resulting solution was filtered using 0.45 μm membrane filters, rinsed with double-distilled water, and diluted to 50 mL in a pretreated volumetric flask. Analyses were performed in duplicate with their respective control solutions [34]. Heavy metal quantification was performed using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Solaar 969 model, UNICAM, Cambridge, UK). An air–acetylene flame was used for measuring Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn, and a nitrous oxide–acetylene flame was used for measuring Cr. Method validation was performed using the certified reference material MESS-1 (marine sediment) from the National Research Council of Canada. Replicate analyses of the reference material showed good accuracy, with relative errors ranging from − 11.9% (Cd) to + 5.9% (Zn). The detection limits for Fe, Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were 0.0043, 0.0028, 0.0045, 0.0054, 0.0016, 0.0080, 0.0130, and 0.0033 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The seeds were drip-irrigated with water from the Mataquito River through a pump that supplied both the experimental field and adjacent fields twice a week for two hours per irrigation. The application of PGPB took place only during bacterization, and the inoculum was not reapplied during the field experiment. No chemical fertilizers were used during the growing season; weed management and seedling training were performed manually. No pest control agents were applied at the site. Plastic grid meshes were used as guides during growth to promote vertical plant development. During harvest, all the plants were removed, separated, and identified according to landrace and treatment. The pods were subsequently collected to obtain seeds, which were stored at room temperature in airtight bags until use.

A total of twenty five seeds from each treatment and landrace were selected and water-soaked overnight. Subsequently, the cotyledons were mechanically separated from the seed coat, and after being weighed separately, they were grinded in mortars using respectively distilled water, absolute ethanol (99.9–100%) and acetone (95.0%). The solvents were then collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm and 4 °C using a refrigerated centrifuge of Bioprocen 22R (Ortoalresa, Madrid, Spain). Next, the supernatant was recovered using a syringe and filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (JetBiofil, Guangzhou, China) and then stored at 4 °C. The concentration of the common bean extracts was determined by the weight of the seed coat and cotyledons relative to the volume of solvents used (w/v %).

The TPC of the bean extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method described by Sánchez-Rangel et al., with some little modifications [35]. Briefly, in a 96-well microplate, 20 µL of ‘Sapito’ bean extract was added to 100 µL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The mixture was vigorously shaken and allowed to rest for 3 min at 20 °C in the dark. Subsequently, 80 µL of 7.5% Na2CO3was added to each well, and the reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark for 30 min at 20 °C. Finally, absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a FLEXA-200HT microplate reader (Allsheng, Hangzhou, China). The results are presented as milligrams equivalent of gallic acid (GAE)/100 g dry seed and were obtained by preparing a calibration curve with different concentrations of gallic acid.

The antioxidant activity of the native bean extracts was evaluated by assessing the scavenging of H2O2, ABTS, and DPPH-mediated free radicals, and metal ion chelation using the Ferrous Ion Chelation (FIC) and the FRAP methods. A 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution was used as a positive control for the antioxidant activities, except in the FIC assay, where EDTA was used at 10 mg mL−1.

where A0is the absorbance of the control with MilliQ water, A1is the absorbance of the reaction between the sample and the H2O2solution, and A2is the absorbance of the sample alone without the H2O2solution.

ABTS-mediated free radical scavenging activity were evaluated following the method used by Mingle & Newsome, with modifications [38]. To 180 µL of ABTS radical solution, 20 µL of native bean extracts were added and allowed to react for 5 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, the absorbance was recorded at 734 nm using a FLEXA-200HT microplate reader (Allsheng, Hangzhou, China). The total antioxidant activity obtained using Eq. 2.

The ferrous ion chelating activity in the native bean extracts was determined following the method described by Dinis et al., with some modifications [39]. To 100 µL of native bean extracts, 10 µL of 2 mM FeCl2and 40 µL of 5 mM ferredoxin were added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before measuring the absorbance at 562 nm using a FLEXA-200HT microplate reader (Allsheng, Hangzhou, China). As negative control, FeCl2was replaced with sterile distilled water. Ferrous iron chelation activity was calculated using Eq. 1, where A0is the absorbance of sterile distilled water, A1is the absorbance of the metal chelation activity, and A2is the absorbance of no reaction activity.

where the blank corresponds to the absorbance of the 1X assay buffer,αis the y-intercept, andmis the slope of the line in the standard curve. For the standard curve, different concentrations of FeCl2obtained by serial dilution at a 1:1 ratio were used.

The antibacterial capacity of native bean extracts was evaluated through their inhibitory effects on the growth of representative gram bacteria,Bacillus cereus(ATCC 14579) for gram positive andPseudomonas putida(ATCC 12633) for gram negative. The fresh inoculate of the bacteriaB. cereusandP. putida(OD600 ≈ 0.5, logarithmic phase culture) were prepared in liquid NB medium and incubated at 37 °C, with 150 rpm for 12 h in a Shaker Incubator, model BJPX-Wichita (Zhengzhou, Henan, China).

The antibacterial activity of the different bean extracts on solid medium was evaluated using the agar cup assay method according to the protocol described by Cholden, (1994) [40] with some modifications. Using previously autoclaved cotton swabs, bacteria were inoculated onto MHA medium (HiMedia, Maharashtra, India), and four wells of different sizes were created using sterile cork borers, into which 20, 40, 60, and 80 µL of native bean extract were added according to the well sizes. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Inhibition to bacterial growth were observed as clear areas surrounding the wells, which were measured using a digital caliper, considering the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal dimensions of the clear areas. Kanamycin at 50 µg mL−1was used as a positive control, and pure solvents used for the extractions were used as negative controls to the experiments.

To study the bacterial growth inhibition, in 5 mL of liquid NB medium (Difco™, New Jersey, USA), bacterial inoculum in logarithmic phase and common bean extracts (concentration of seed coat extracts 21.75 ± 1.33 w/v% and concentration of cotyledon extracts 57.61 ± 1.60 w/v%) were added in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio and incubated at 37 °C, 150 rpm for 12 h. Optical density (OD) of the cultures was assessed by measuring absorbance at 590 nm using a FLEXA-200HT plate reader (Allsheng, Hangzhou, China) with 96-well plates and 5 replicates per measurement. While a culture with only bacteria served as experimental control, kanamycin at 50 µg mL−1was used as a positive control, and the solvents used for extraction were used as negative controls. Bacterial density was determined by the differences in absorbance between the cultures treated with common bean extracts and the culture without any treatment.

The biological activities reported for the common bean extracts were all performed in triplicates, and the results shown correspond to the mean ± standard deviation. GraphPad Prism v9.4.1 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) was used to plot the results and determine significant differences at the solvent, treatment, and structural levels through a One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test in total phenolic content between solvents in both structures, antioxidant activities mediated by H2O2, DPPH, ABTS, FIC and FRAP, and antibacterial activity in liquid medium. Also, statistical differences between antibacterial activities by liquid medium along with cell viability assay were estimated using Two-way Anova followed by Tukey’s test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in both cases. The total phenol content was evaluated using a two-tailed Student t-test with a minimum significance level ofp< 0.05 between seed structures.

The PGP strains used in the treatments,B. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2, were susceptible to all antibiotics included in the tested discs. In both cases, greater growth inhibition was observed in response to antibiotics targeting Gram-positive bacteria (G + 2 and G + 15) (Supplementary Figure S1). Co-trimoxazole was particularly more effective againstB. proteolyticusCyn1, whereasB. safensisCyn2 showed greater sensitivity to penicillin. The experimental field in Curepto, used for cultivating Chilean bean landrace plants under PGPB application, showed a high abundance of Fe in the soil (28.48 ± 0.85 g·kg⁻¹), followed by other metals whose concentrations were considerably lower in comparison to the most abundant element. The soil of the experimental area had the following basic physicochemical composition: organic matter content 1.64%, pH 5.75, electrical conductivity 0.12 dS·m⁻¹, and macro/micronutrient contents: N (22 ppm), K (478 ppm), P (38 ppm), Ca (7.71 cmol(+)·kg⁻¹), and B (0.48 ppm). The concentrations of metals in the Curepto soil were as follows: Mn (649.21 ± 29.56 mg·kg⁻¹), Cu (32.20 ± 0.06 mg·kg⁻¹), Zn (30.16 ± 3.08 mg·kg⁻¹), Ni (10.98 ± 0.04 mg·kg⁻¹), Cr (8.50 ± 0.54 mg·kg⁻¹), Pb (7.04 ± 0.72 mg·kg⁻¹), and finally, Cd (0.45 ± 0.03 mg·kg⁻¹).

To confirm the persistence of the bacterial inoculants, confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of viable bacterial cells adhering to the root surfaces of the germinated seedlings, supporting effective PGPB colonization (Supplementary Figure S2). Additionally, soil samples collected after the adaptation phase and prior to transplantation were subjected to heat treatment for spore induction. These samples exhibited an increase in optical density in cultures inoculated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2, with a higher concentration observed in the culture corresponding to soil treated with the bacterial consortium (Supplementary Figure S3). No growth was detected in any of the control soil solutions. The germination of spores from the PGPB applied in the treatment indicates their ability to persist in the soil after inoculation, contrasting with the sterile control soil.

The seed coat extracts of ‘Sapito’ bean landrace presented a concentration of 21.75 ± 1.33 w/v% for the extractions with distilled water, ethanol and acetone, while in the case of the cotyledon extracts, concentrations of 57.61 ± 1.60 w/v% were obtained for the same solvents. The TPC of the water, ethanol, and acetone extracts of the seed coat and cotyledons of ‘Sapito’ bean landrace is presented in Table1. Among the seed coat extracts, the seeds from the Consortium treatment exhibited the lowest concentration of phenols at 1.03 ± 1.02 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, in contrast to other treatments, with seeds treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 showing the highest phenolic content at 3.66 ± 2.70 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds. Conversely, for acetone-based extracts, the consortium treatment achieved the highest concentration at 7.52 ± 1.09 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, while seeds treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 had the lowest at 4.73 ± 2.74 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds. Among the ethanolic extracts, the highest total phenolic concentration was found in seeds treated withB. safensisCyn2 at 2.51 ± 1.66 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, while the control seeds showed the lowest concentration at 1.65 ± 0.97 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds.

Significant differences were found between the TPC of cotyledons extracts and seed coat extracts from ‘Sapito’ bean seeds (p< 0.001) (Fig.1). The aqueous extracts of seeds treated with the consortium showed the highest phenolic concentration of 95.90 ± 27.81 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, closely followed by the control at 94.20 ± 32.96 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds. Seeds treated with individual bacteria demonstrated the lowest activity among the aqueous extracts. The ethanolic extracts of cotyledons from control revealed the highest phenolic concentration at 36.33 ± 19.96 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, followed by that treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 at 34.73 ± 18.47 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds. Cotyledons from seeds produced by both the Consortium andB. safensisCyn2 showed the lowest phenolic concentration at approximately 32.85 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, indicating a reduction of about 9.58% in the phenols present in the ethanol-soluble cotyledons.

For the acetone extracts, the highest accumulation of phenols was observed in control at 41.56 ± 12.34 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds, followed by the cotyledons extracts from seeds produced by the consortium at 38.8 ± 13.60 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds. The cotyledons from seeds treated with individual bacteria exhibited the lowest phenolic concentrations within this group, with values of 34.20 ± 17.04 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds for those treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 and 33.98 ± 17.09 mg GAE/100 g dry seeds for those treated withB. safensisCyn2.

The antioxidant activities of ‘Sapito’ bean extracts were evaluated based on the solvent used and the treatment applied in seed production (Fig.2). All extracts demonstrated a remarkable capacity to capture over 95% of the free radicals generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with extracts from the seed coats inoculated with the consortium exhibiting, on average, the highest activity (Fig.2A). The extracts showed variations in their activity depending on the solvent used (Fig.2B). In particular, ethanolic extracts presented the best performance compared to the other samples, with moderately significant differences relative to the cotyledons extracts of the same solvent (p< 0.01). All extracts behaved similarly to positive control, achieving a reduction of 97.74 ± 0.66% of H2O2-mediated free radicals. For the evaluation of free radical scavenging property using the DPPH assay, cotyledons extracts showed better activity than those of the seed coats, although it showed greater variability in the results (Fig.2C). Consortium-treated bean extracts performed better to control andB. safensisCyn 2, whileB. proteolyticusCyn1 showed the lowest activity (Fig.2A).

Higher antioxidant capacity was observed in seed extracts using absolute ethanol and acetone as solvents; water extracts of the cotyledons showed no activity in any bean landrace. The highest activity was recorded in the acetone extracts of the cotyledons, with 48.78 ± 11.32% of free radicals captured, followed by the absolute ethanol extracts with 33.46 ± 8.71%. Cotyledon extracts of ‘Sapito’ that used absolute ethanol and acetone showed moderate significant differences compared to their counterparts from the seed coats (p< 0.01) and were different from those based on water (p< 0.05). All samples exhibited significantly lower activities than the positive control, which reached a 94.93 ± 0.15% reduction of free radicals (Fig.2B).

In relation to ABTS-mediated free radicals, all cotyledon extracts displayed better activity than those from the seed coats (Fig.2C), with moderately significant differences among the seed structures. Extracts obtained from treatment inoculated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 exhibited the best antioxidant activities, with 67.39 ± 14.87% for cotyledons samples and 19.35 ± 9.01% for seed coat samples (Fig.2A). Among the solvents, cotyledons extract in water showed the best activity, with 82.08 ± 11.44%, followed by those in absolute ethanol and acetone, with approximately ∼56% reduction of ABTS-mediated free radicals. Seed coat extracts presented the lowest overall activities, with values of 21.57 ± 2.83%, 20.28 ± 1.99%, and 9.96 ± 1.27% of free radicals captured from ABTS, using distilled water, ethanol, and acetone, respectively. Significant differences (p< 0.05) were found between the use of water and absolute ethanol versus acetone in seed coat extracts, as well as moderately significant differences between cotyledons extracts in water and those from seed coats (p< 0.01). Cotyledons extract in absolute ethanol also showed moderately significant differences (p< 0.01) compared to seed coat extracts in water and ethanol, as well as highly significant differences with seed coat extracts in acetone (p< 0.001). Cotyledons extract in acetone exhibited significant differences against those from seed coats using the same solvent (p< 0.05). The positive control recorded 98.91 ± 0.07% of free radicals captured from ABTS (Fig.2B), being the best record in antioxidant activity for this free radical.

Regarding the metal ion chelation activity, the activities of ‘Sapito’ bean extracts were evaluated through ferrous ion chelation (FIC) and the FRAP assay. Significant differences (p< 0.05) were found between the performance of cotyledons extracts from the control and the activity of seed coat extracts from the same treatment, as well as in comparison with cotyledons extracts produced withB. proteolyticusCyn1 inoculation. All seed coat extracts from seeds treated with PGPBs exhibited better antioxidant activity compared to control seeds. The highest activity in cotyledons was recorded in the control, with 64.84 ± 6.80%, followed by treatments with the bacteriaB. proteolyticusCyn1 and the consortium, with ~ 56%. In seed coat extracts, the highest activities were observed in the consortium, with 38.38 ± 20.77%, followed by the individual PGP bacterial treatments, which showed ~ 26% and ~ 21% of chelated ions forB. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2, respectively (Fig.2A). Greater metal ion chelation was observed in cotyledons extracts from consortium seeds using acetone as a solvent (69.85 ± 6.48%). This showed significant differences (p< 0.05) against cotyledons extracts in absolute ethanol and moderate differences (p< 0.01) compared to seed coat extracts with the same solvent. Among seed coat extracts, the highest activity was observed when using water as a solvent (31.60 ± 10.28%), closely followed by acetone (29.94 ± 19.03%) (Fig.2B). The positive control demonstrated 70.38 ± 1.09% of chelated metal ions. The seed coat extracts from seeds produced with the consortium showed significant ferrous ion chelating activity in both acetone-based and aqueous extracts.

Higher ferric ion chelation activities were recorded in cotyledons extracts in the FRAP assay (Fig.2C). In both seed coat and cotyledon extracts, all seeds produced with PGPB showed improved performance in FRAP-mediated ion chelation compared to control seeds. Treatment withB. proteolyticusCyn1 showed cotyledons of `Sapito` with the highest reducing activity, reaching 383 ± 123.6 µM eq. of Fe²⁺, followed by those produced by the consortium treatment (~ 306 µM) (Fig.2A). Cotyledons extract in ethanol showed significant differences (p< 0.05) with seed coat extracts of the same solvent and those extracted in water. Among seed coats, common beans produced withB. safensisCyn2 showed the highest reducing activity with 95.82 ± 136.2%. The positive control reached a value of 467.72 ± 27.14 µM eq. of Fe²⁺ (Fig.2B).

The antibacterial potential of ‘Sapito’ common bean seeds was evaluated by analyzing the extracts of the seed coat and cotyledons on bacterial cultures ofB. cereus(gram positive) andP. putida(gram negative). The extracts obtained with distilled water showed no inhibitory activity against the bacteriaB. cereusin any of the treatments, while the extracts in absolute ethanol and acetone exhibited significant variations in their effectiveness depending on the treatment applied (Fig.3).

Ethanolic extracts from the bean seed coat demonstrated greater inhibitory activity against gram positiveB. cereuscompared to those from the cotyledons, with an average inhibition zone of 9.42 ± 4.96 mm in the treatment withB. proteolyticusCyn1 (Fig.3). In contrast, the cotyledons extracts showed their best activity in beans produced with the consortium treatment, with an inhibition zone of 5.58 ± 1.14 mm. Acetone extracts of the seed coat also revealed significant activity, particularly in the consortium treatment, which exhibited an inhibition zone of 6.08 ± 0.91 mm, and the inoculation ofB. safensisCyn2, with 6.16 ± 1.74 mm.

Regarding the evaluation against gram negativeP. putida, only the seed coat extracts using distilled water and acetone showed inhibitory activity in all applied volumes (Fig.3). The seed coat extracts from theB. safensisCyn2 and consortium treatments exhibited the largest inhibition zones, measuring 5.33 ± 0.96 mm and 4.19 ± 0.67 mm, respectively. In the ethanolic extracts, antibacterial activity was superior in the seed coat compared to the cotyledons, with beans from theB. safensisCyn2 and control treatments showing the largest inhibition zones at 4.91 ± 0.90 mm and 4.26 ± 1.96 mm, respectively. Finally, acetone extracts also showed greater activity in the seed coat compared to the cotyledons, with beans from the control treatment exhibiting an inhibition zone of 5.75 ± 2.75 mm, followed by theB. safensisCyn2 treatment, which showed approximately half that size of the inhibition zone.

At the structural level, highly significant differences were identified between the antibacterial activities of the extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons of ‘Sapito’ beans, suggesting that the bioactive compounds in the seed coat may be responsible for their greater effectiveness against the evaluated bacteria.

The cultures grown in the presence of the solvents used to obtain the extracts generally showed a lower optical density compared to cultures with the bacteria alone, due to the antiseptic effect that certain solvents may exhibit. Therefore, the antimicrobial effect of the extracts in the cultures was determined by comparing them to the optical density of bacterial cultures with the solvents. The aqueous extracts of the seed coat and cotyledons from ‘Sapito’ beans demonstrated optical densities that were generally equal or greater than those of the controls (Fig.4). Cotyledons extracts exhibited a higher bacterial density compared to seed coats extracts. Notably, treatment withB. proteolyticusCyn1 resulted in the most significant increase in bacterial density in the culture (+ 91.59%), with statistically significant differences observed against the control (p< 0.05). This was followed by treatments withB. safensisCyn2 and the consortium, with the control exhibiting the lowest effect. In the case of seed coats extracts, those derived from the consortium treatment were the only ones that demonstrated a lower optical density compared to the negative control (−19.08%) and the blank (−3.58%). Furthermore, significant differences were identified in antibacterial activity between seeds produced by the control andB. proteolyticusCyn1 (p< 0.05), as well as highly significant differences against the treatment withB. safensisCyn2 (p< 0.001) according to Two-way ANOVA (Fig.4A) (Supplementary Material Table 14).

All ethanolic extracts showed a reduction in optical density of the culture compared to the negative control and the blank. The seed coat extract from seeds treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 exhibited the greatest decrease in optical density (−27.19%). In contrast, cotyledons extract from seeds treated withB. safensisCyn2 displayed the highest reduction in bacterial growth (−22.75%), with significant differences in activity observed compared to the cotyledons from the consortium treatment (p< 0.05) (Supplementary Material Table 14). In the case of both, the consortium had the least effect on the optical density of the culture.

Moreover, extracts from bean seeds using acetone as a solvent indicated a reduction in optical density across all samples analyzed. The seed coats from the consortium/treated samples showed the greatest reduction in culture density (−20.26%), with significant differences against the seed coats extracts fromB. proteolyticusCyn1 (p< 0.05). The control exhibited the least effect on the proliferation ofB. cereus(−5.75%). In contrast, the cotyledons extract from the Control treatment demonstrated the highest performance (−18.69%) compared to the negative control and the blank, which displayed similar optical density values. Moderately significant differences were found between the effects of the seed coat and cotyledons extracts using distilled water and the extracts with ethanol and acetone on the culture ofB. cereusin liquid medium (p< 0.01) estimated by Two-way Anova (Fig.4A).

The aqueous extracts of ‘Sapito’ beans demonstrated an increase in the optical density of theP. putidaculture in the liquid medium for all analyzed samples. The extracts from the seed coats of seeds treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 showed the most notable effect, with an increase of 60.16% in optical density, followed by treatments withB. safensisCyn2 (+ 24.47%) and the consortium (+ 14.14%). In contrast, the seed coat of seeds from the Control treatment exhibited optical density values comparable to those of the negative control and the blank. Highly significant differences were observed between the effects of the extracts from seeds produced byB. proteolyticusCyn1 compared to those from the control and consortium seeds (p< 0.001) (Supplementary Material Table 16). Regarding the cotyledon extracts, the seeds from the control treatment showed a notable increase of 70.48% in the optical density of theP. putidaculture, followed by extracts from the consortium (+ 59.15%). The treatments withB. safensisCyn2 (+ 33.45%) andB. proteolyticusCyn1 (+ 30.86%) exhibited the least effect on the increase in optical density, achieving increments of 33.45% and 30.86%, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were found between the extracts of seeds fromB. proteolyticusCyn1 compared to the Consortium and Control treatments (p< 0.05), with the latter treatment also being significantly different from the control seeds (p< 0.001) according to Two-way ANOVA (Supplementary Material Table 16).

Ethanolic extracts of the seed coat showed a notable inhibition of optical density inP. putida, with seeds obtained fromB. safensisCyn2 achieving the greatest reduction in optical density at −23.79%. This effect was closely followed by the seeds from the control treatment (−23.12%) and those fromB. proteolyticusCyn1 (−22.78%). In contrast, the extracts of the seed coat from seeds treated with the Consortium exhibited the lowest antibacterial activity, with a reduction of only 17.40% in the optical density of the culture. Additionally, significant differences were observed in the inhibitory activity on the growth ofP. putidabetween the extracts of the seed coat from the consortium seeds and those from the control, as well as with those produced withB. proteolyticusCyn1 (p< 0.05).

The cotyledons extract of beans treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 demonstrated an approximate 28.62% reduction in the optical density of the culture compared to the negative control and the blank. This was followed by the control seeds, which showed a decrease of 19.98%, and the consortium seeds, with a reduction of 14.14%. In contrast, the seeds obtained in the presence ofB. safensisCyn2 exhibited an increasement on the optical density ofP. putidagrowth, with a 1.46% increase. Additionally, significant differences in inhibitory activity were found between the seed extracts fromB. proteolyticusCyn 1 and those from the consortium (p< 0.05). The extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons of bean seeds, obtained using acetone as a solvent, showed a slight inhibition in bacterial culture growth compared to the negative control. Specifically, the seeds from the control treatment exhibited the greatest reduction in optical density of the culture, with a decrease of 6.73% for the seed coats extracts and 6.96% for the cotyledon extracts. Additionally, the cotyledons displayed significant differences compared to the seeds treated withB. proteolyticusCyn1 (p< 0.05).

Two samples exhibiting the highest antibacterial activity in solid and liquid media were selected as candidates to evaluate the cellular viability of gram positiveB. cereusand gram negativeP. putidausing confocal microscopy. As illustrated in Fig.5, the treatment of acetone extracts of the seed coats of the consortium andB. safensisCyn2 treatments resulted in the appearance of deadB. cereuscells, shown by the red staining of cells resulting from propidium iodide staining. Using images obtained from confocal microscopy, the number of cells present in each field was estimated using ImageJ software. It was observed that the acetone extracts from seed coats produced by the consortium showed 35.96% dead cells, while the extracts from the seed coats ofB. safensisCyn2 exhibited 16.10% dead cells (Fig.5). In the latter, significant differences were identified between the % of cells that remained viable (stained with SYTO 9 fluorescing green) and those that died to the action of the extract.

Regarding the cellular viability ofP. putidacultures, the ethanolic extracts from seed coats treated withB. safensisCyn2 and the control, selected for their best performance in antibacterial activities in both solid and liquid media, displayed low inhibitory activity on the proliferation ofP. putida. This was reflected in a low density of red colored bacteria (Supplementary Figure S4). Seed coat extracts treated withB. safensisCyn2 revealed an inhibition of 4.05% of viableP. putidacells compared to approximately 95.95% of surviving cells. A similar pattern was observed in the ethanolic extracts of the Control seed coats, where a reduction of 1.62% of viable cells in the culture and a survival of 98.38% of cells were documented (Fig.5). Significant differences were found between the density of live bacteria (labeled with Syto9) versus bacteria affected by the application of extracts (labeled with PI) according to One-way ANOVA (p< 0.05). In turn, moderately significant differences were observed between dead cells compared to the total number of cells observed in different microscopy fields. By Two-way ANOVA, moderately significant differences were found between the cell viability ofP. putidaandB. cereuswhen applying bean seed coat extracts treated withB safensisCyn2, both for live and dead cells observed (Supplementary Material Table 17).

The correlations between antioxidant activities and the total phenolic content (TPC) ofP. vulgarisgrains are presented in Fig.6. In seed coat extracts (Fig.6A), a strong positive correlation was identified between TPC and the quantity of Fe²⁺ equivalents reduced in the FRAP assay (r² = 0.82). Furthermore, a moderate positive correlation was detected between TPC and the antioxidant activity assessed via DPPH free radical scavenging (r² = 0.44). Conversely, a strong negative correlation was found between TPC and antioxidant activity measured by the ABTS radical assay (r² = −0.77), whereas a moderately weak negative correlation was observed with antioxidant activity evaluated through hydrogen peroxide scavenging (r² = −0.58). Regarding cotyledon extracts (Fig.6B), moderate positive correlations were noted between TPC and antioxidant activity mediated by H₂O₂ and ABTS radicals (r² = 0.61 and r² = 0.56, respectively). In contrast, TPC exhibited a strong negative correlation with antioxidant activity measured using the DPPH radical assay (r² = −0.72) and a moderate negative correlation with metal ion chelation capacity assessed in the FRAP assay (r² = −0.60).

This study assessed the impact of PGP bacteria, both individually (B. proteolyticusCyn1 andB. safensisCyn2) and as a consortium, on the total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity, and antibacterial potential of the Chilean ‘Sapito’ landrace of common beans. The experimental field at Mataquito River bed is known for the cultivation of various crops, including beans, cereals, and vegetables. The results revealed that PGPB inoculation significantly modulated phenolic component accumulation, free radical scavenging capacity, and antibacterial properties, highlighting the potential of microbial inoculation as a strategy to enhance the nutritional and functional properties of common beans.

The results demonstrated that the TPC varied significantly between seed structures (cotyledon vs. seed coat), bacterial treatments, and extraction solvents. Consortium-treated seeds exhibited higher phenolic accumulation in aqueous and acetone extracts, whereas ethanolic extracts showed a decrease in TPC compared to the control. The higher phenolic content in aqueous extracts suggests an increased solubility or biosynthesis of water-soluble phenolics under PGPB influence, aligning with previous studies showing that bacterial inoculation enhances the mobilization of specific phenolic compounds [27,42,43]. The seed coat extracts showed lower TPC than cotyledons, which contrasts with previous reports where seed coats accumulated more phenolic compounds due to their protective role against oxidative stress and pathogens [44,45]. Nevertheless, the TPC may differ among these structures, being linked to the color patterns of the seeds, which are associated with the concentration of phenols, anthocyanins, and flavonoids in them [46]. However, PGP bacterial treatments appeared to modify phenolic distribution, possibly by altering metabolic fluxes within the plant. This shift is supported by earlier findings in legumes where PGPB inoculation was linked to the upregulation of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis [47].

The antioxidant activity ofP.vulgarisextracts, assessed through multiple radical scavenging and metal ion chelation assays, showed that ethanolic and acetone extracts displayed the highest activity. This observation aligns with prior studies where ethanol and acetone were found to be more effective in extracting phenolic compounds with strong antioxidant properties than aqueous extracts [48]. The consortium-treated seeds exhibited enhanced antioxidant activity in aqueous extracts, which can be attributed to an increased abundance of water-soluble phenolics, likely stimulated by microbial interactions with the plant [49]. This is consistent with studies reporting that rhizobacterial inoculation improves antioxidant enzyme activity and phenolic accumulation under stress conditions [50,51]. Notably, acetone extracts from consortium-treated cotyledons displayed high FRAP and DPPH radical scavenging activities, reinforcing the notion that bacterial treatments can enhance specific fractions of bioactive compounds.

The strong positive correlation between TPC and ferric ion reduction (FRAP assay) suggests that phenolic compounds were major contributors to the antioxidant potential, as previously established for common bean polyphenols [52]. However, the negative correlation between TPC and ABTS activity indicates that not all phenolic compounds contribute equally to radical scavenging, suggesting the presence of other bioactive metabolites with antioxidant potential. Conversely, the correlations observed between TPC and antioxidant activities in seed coat extracts are opposite to those found in cotyledon extracts. This difference may be associated with the specific metabolites and minerals accumulated in these structures.

The antibacterial activity of the bean extracts showed clear distinctions between seed coats and cotyledons, as well as between solvents. Ethanolic and acetone extracts from the seed coat exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against gram positiveB. cereusand gram-negativeP. putida, particularly in seeds treated with the PGPB consortium. These findings corroborate earlier reports that bean seed coats contain antimicrobial compounds such as tannins and flavonoids [53]. Interestingly, aqueous extracts exhibited minimal antibacterial activity, suggesting that the most effective antibacterial compounds were poorly soluble in water. The greater activity observed in ethanolic, and acetone extracts is consistent with previous research showing that organic solvents are more efficient at extracting antimicrobial phenolic compounds, including flavonols and condensed tannins [53,54]. The enhanced antibacterial activity in consortium-treated seeds suggests a possible induction of defence metabolites in response to microbial interactions, as reported in legume-PGPB symbioses before by Meza et al., [29]. Ebrahim et al., (2022) investigated the antibacterial potential of bioactive compounds derived from beans, finding that protein isolates exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistantEnterobacteralescultures [55]. The cell viability assays confirmed thatB. cereuswas more susceptible to phenolic-rich extracts thanP. putida, supporting the notion that Gram-positive bacteria are more vulnerable to phenolic compounds due to their less complex cell wall structure. The use of Syto9/IP staining has been employed in fluorescence microscopy for the qualitative observation of the antibacterial effect on bacterial growth, demonstrating the reproducibility of this method for visualizing live and dead cells in a culture [56].The increased antibacterial potency of extracts from consortium-treated seeds suggests that PGPB may enhance the synthesis of antimicrobial phenolics, either by direct stimulation of secondary metabolism or by altering plant defence pathways [57].

This study represents the first investigation into the functional properties of a Chilean local landrace of common beans (‘Sapito’ landrace) when cultivated with PGPB, either individually or as a consortium. The findings are highly relevant in the context of germplasm conservation, as local landraces harbour unique genetic traits that contribute to agricultural resilience, nutritional quality, and stress adaptation [58]. However, climate change, habitat loss, and the dominance of commercial cultivars threaten the diversity of local varieties, necessitating efforts to preserve and promote these underutilized crops [59]. The ability of PGPB to enhance the antioxidant and antibacterial potential of beans further underscores their role in sustainable agriculture. Likewise, considering different combinations of mechanical and chemical extraction methods could contribute to the development of pharmaceutical and food products with enhanced nutritional properties, by enabling the recovery of specific profiles of bioactive compounds depending on the method used.

By fostering microbial-plant interactions that improve phenolic biosynthesis and bioactivity, bacterial consortia could reduce dependence on synthetic fertilizers and chemical preservatives, aligning with agroecological practices that seek to enhance soil health, crop quality, and food security [60]. Additionally, the popularization of local varieties like ‘Sapito’ can contribute to dietary diversification and nutritional security, particularly in regions where common beans are a staple protein and fiber source [61]; aligning with the goal of UN Sustainable Development Goal 2. Future research should focus on identifying the specific phenolic compounds responsible for the observed bioactivities, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bacterial-induced metabolic shifts, and exploring the adaptability of PGPB-inoculated local varieties to diverse environmental conditions. Given the growing interest in sustainable crop production, the results provide a strong foundation for integrating microbial biotechnology into legume cultivation, particularly for the conservation, valorization, and commercialization of local germplasm.
