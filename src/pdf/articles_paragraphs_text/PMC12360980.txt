Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) significantly impacts quality of life after rectal cancer surgery. Transanal irrigation (TAI) is a potential treatment, but long-term outcome data are limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAI in LARS patients after more than 5 years of follow-up.

From April 2015 to December 2019, consecutive patients with LARS following low anterior resection for rectal cancer, trained in TAI at Careggi University Hospital, were prospectively collected. Patients with LARS scores > 30 or those failing conservative management were included. TAI was performed using the Peristeen® device, with a standard protocol of 400–600 ml irrigation 3–4 times/week. Primary outcomes were maintenance of TAI benefits and patient satisfaction (VAS).

After an appropriate training and evaluation period, 35 patients were referred to TAI. While interruptions in the first year were mainly related to technical problems, ineffectiveness, or the onset of other clinical problems, afterward, patients tended to discontinue treatment only in the event of death (6 patients) or clinical well-being (5 patients). At the last follow-up control, with a median follow-up of 89 months, 15 patients (43%) still used TAI treatment. The median VAS satisfaction score for bowel control was 8.2.

TAI demonstrates sustained benefits in LARS patients over 5 years, with significant symptom improvement and high patient satisfaction. Further studies are needed to identify predictors of long-term success.

Rectal cancer surgery, particularly low anterior resection, still represents a cornerstone of curative treatment in many cases of rectal cancer; however, it often leads to a cluster of complex and debilitating symptoms collectively known as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). Despite successful oncological outcomes, many patients face persistent and distressing bowel dysfunction, including urgency, clustering, frequent bowel movements, impaired defecation, and incontinence. These symptoms can severely compromise the quality of life, affect social reintegration, and necessitate ongoing medical management. Given the long-term nature of LARS, identifying and sustaining effective management strategies are paramount to restoring functional independence for these patients. Current management strategies for LARS range from dietary modifications and pharmacological interventions to biofeedback and sacral nerve stimulation. Among these, transanal irrigation (TAI) has emerged as a promising conservative treatment demonstrating efficacy in improving bowel control and symptom severity in numerous studies [1–3]. However, the true success of any long-term management approach hinges on its durability and patient adherence over extended periods. While initial improvements with TAI are encouraging, there is a critical lack of understanding about how these benefits are maintained over many years, what challenges patients face, and why some discontinue treatment. Such long-term data is essential for clinicians to provide realistic expectations and tailor ongoing support. Therefore, this study aimed to provide long-term insights into the effectiveness and patient experience with transanal irrigation for managing LARS after rectal cancer surgery.

From April 2015 to December 2019, all consecutive patients affected by LARS after low anterior resection for rectal cancer who were trained for transanal irrigation (TAI) at Careggi University Hospital in Florence (Italy) were prospectively collected in a dedicated database and included in this long-term study.

Patients were selected for TAI treatment as previously described [1]. Briefly, between 30 and 40 days after rectal surgery (if no stoma) or stoma closure, the functional status and quality of life of all patients were evaluated. Patients were considered for TAI if LARS score was > 30 (major LARS) or after the failure of conservative measures (low volume enemas, dietary support and fibers, loperamide, biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle training) with persistent limitations in daily activities and quality of life.

Inclusion criteria for the present study were: follow-up period of > 5 years after TAI prescription and LARS symptoms due to anterior resection with Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) for rectal cancer. All patients were trained by healthcare professionals. Patients unable to carry out the procedure independently or with caregiver assistance were excluded from treatment.

In all cases, the TAI procedure was performed using the Peristeen® device (Coloplast A/S, Denmark) with a balloon/cone catheter. According to the follow-up protocol, patients were evaluated every year after the initial prescription. Every unplanned office visit was recorded. In December 2024, all patients were contacted by phone for a status update.

The standard TAI protocol consisted of irrigation on alternate days (three or four times per week) with a water amount of 400–600 ml. All changes to the protocol were recorded.

The primary objective of the study was to assess if the use of TAI and its advantages were maintained over time, focusing on satisfaction levels regarding bowel control measured using a visual analog scale (VAS scale) ranging from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (completely satisfied). VAS score was recorded at every follow-up evaluation. A thorough analysis of dropout frequency and reasons was also conducted, with particular attention to complications and perceived treatment efficacy. Additional treatments were recorded.

For every patient, clinical (age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities), tumor related (distance from the anal verge, stage), surgical (open or laparoscopy, complications), stoma (presence, type, time before closure, and complications), and short-term data (morbidity and mortality 30 days after surgery) were analyzed to evaluate potential predictive factors of long-term outcomes. Anastomotic leak was defined according to the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer (ISREC) criteria as a defect of the intestinal wall at the anastomotic site (including suture and staple lines of neorectal reservoirs) leading to a communication between the intra- and extraluminal compartments, proven by radiological or endoscopic examination.

Symptom resolution was considered as a patient-reported perspective. This means that patients no longer feel the need to continue treatment because they are satisfied with their bowel function even without the aid of TAI.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient population. Continuous variables (age, BMI, distance from the anal verge) were presented as median with range, while categorical variables (sex, tumor stage, and surgical approach) were presented as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square tests were used to compare characteristics of patients who dropped out of the study with those who completed the study. Multivariate analysis was not possible due to the small sample size. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

During the study period, 97 consecutive patients were evaluated for functional alterations after TME for rectal cancer. According to selection criteria (major LARS or severe limitations of daily activities or quality of life despite conservative measures) TAI was proposed to 43 patients. Eight patients (18%) refused the treatment after the training period (during the first month). Thirty-five patients went to the first prescription of TAI material and were analyzed for the present study. During the first 6 months, 5 patients discontinued the treatment, mainly due to technical difficulties or clinical impairment (such as anal pain or bleeding). Thirty patients (70%) continued the treatment for more than one year. Demographic data were reported in Table1. Median follow-up was 89 months (range 61–118).

The reasons for the discontinuation of therapy are given in Fig.1. While in the first year interruptions are mainly related to technical problems, ineffectiveness, or the onset of other clinical problems, after that, patients tend to discontinue treatment only in the event of death or a clinical situation for which irrigation is no longer necessary.

After 5 years, 17 patients (48%) still use TAI treatment. The median 5-year VAS satisfaction score for bowel control was 8.2 (range 4–10). Patients’ satisfaction score values remained stable over time. At the last follow-up, 15 patients were still using TAI (one patient was deceased, and one patient discontinued TAI due to symptom resolution). The progressive evolution of treatment compliance is summarized in Fig.2. At the last follow-up, only 3 patients used additional medications (2 patients: fibers, 1 patient: loperamide).

At the end of the study period, if we exclude deceased patients (6) and patients that suspend the treatment because of persistent clinical benefits (5), only 9 patients (25%) required different or additional treatments. Of these, 5 patients underwent new colostomy creation, three patients benefited from sacral neuromodulation, and one (elderly) patient is managing its dysfunction without other treatments.

No bowel perforations were reported during the study period. One patient, not included in the present analysis, experienced a bowel perforation in the first week after training and was treated with a stoma. Minor complications such as limited bleeding or pain were reported by 5 patients (14%). In 4 of these patients, these complications were cited as the reason for treatment interruption.

The role of TAI for the management of LARS symptoms is now well established [4–6]. However, in many patients, the complaints do not resolve over time despite the treatments, requiring them to be managed over the years [7,8]. Therefore, long-term data on treatment adherence and outcomes are crucial. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the long-term trend of TAI use in LARS patients, specifically examining outcomes in patients with at least 5 years of follow-up.

Even if TAI usually allows a regular bowel emptying with fewer unexpected evacuations, it requires that patients adapt to a new routine involving its planning and use. In the present study, despite the patients’ desire to feel “normal” again (even freeing from the device) and the potential rehabilitative effect of a constant irrigation regime, only 5 patients (15%) discontinued it due to improvement in symptoms, considering it no longer necessary.

On the other hand, it is evident that most patients, especially after the first year where ineffectiveness and technical or clinical issues are resolved, continue with the use of irrigation as an irreplaceable element in the management of bowel function. This is also confirmed in a questionnaire study for patients using TAI for LARS, in which irrigation benefits were confirmed from a patient’s perspective [9]. Moreover, this study also confirms that in many cases irrigation may be the only treatment needed to re-establish sufficient control of bowel function to allow an adequate quality of life.

After 5 years of treatment, 48% of patients are still continuing the use of transanal irrigation. However, if we exclude deceased patients and those who discontinued the treatment because it was no longer necessary (however treated), the percentage rises to 66%. It means that potentially 2/3 of patients are still following treatment after 5 years.

In this study, some elements were considered to optimize the study population and reduce possible bias. In particular, the early functional postoperative evaluation of patients (30–60 days), the inclusion of patients after rectal resection with TME only, and the systematic training of patients allow us to have useful information on the course of therapy in this specific group of patients. In particular, a structured training session is considered essential to reduce complications and improve patients’ compliance. As reported by Bildstein et al., less than 50% of functional patients continued to use transanal irrigation (TAI) for the treatment of their defecation disorders one year after their training sessions, and the only predictive factor for TAI discontinuation was the quality of the training [10]. Moreover, appropriate training and a thorough clinical study of the patient are essential tools for reducing the risk of severe complications, in particular perforation. The risk of perforation is estimated at 1:167,000 irrigations but may be slightly higher in these patients given their surgical and therapeutic history (radiotherapy) [11]. In the present study, no bowel perforation was reported during the study period. However, two-thirds of perforations usually happened within the first 8 weeks rather than in the long-term period.

Although the presence of an anal or anastomotic scar deformity or the results of an anastomotic dehiscence may be considered risk factors for TAI ineffectiveness, intolerance, complications, or reduced compliance, this was not found statistically significant, although the small number of cases may have conditioned the statistical validity of the result.

Transanal irrigation remains a valuable tool in the management of functional bowel disorders after anterior rectal resection even after many years. While in the first months, reasons for discontinuation are often related to technical or clinical problems, the main reasons for discontinuation over the years are related to clinical improvement or death. Considering these results, after five years, approximately two out of three patients still manage their problems positively with TAI. Further studies are needed to identify predictors of long-term success.
