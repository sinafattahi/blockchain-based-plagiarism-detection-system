Hyperglycemic states (prediabetes and diabetes) are associated with heart failure (HF) risk. We aimed to identify distinct metabolites for subclinical cardiac dysfunction, a precursor of HF, in hyperglycemic or euglycemic individuals.

We conducted cross-sectional and prospective analyses of 2,492 HF-free participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study visit 5, 2011–2013. A total of 1,297 participants were hyperglycemic (assessed on the basis of hemoglobin A1c>5.7%, fasting glucose >100 mg/dL, use of diabetes medication, or diagnosis), and 1,195 were euglycemic. We used logistic regression for analysis of association between 790 metabolites and cardiac dysfunction, defined according to echocardiographic abnormalities (left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic or diastolic dysfunction) or elevated NT-proBNP or troponin T, in two glycemic groups separately. We used Cox regression for prospective association between cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites identified in the prior step and HF risk, adjusting for clinical risk factors. Analyses were replicated in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (n= 5,167).

Microvascular disease–related metabolites (e.g., pseudouridine, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, N6-acetyllysine, N2,N5-diacetylornithine) were associated with cardiac dysfunction in hyperglycemic individuals. Carbohydrate and cofactor-derived metabolites (e.g., gulonate, erythrocyte) were associated with cardiac dysfunction in euglycemic individuals. These cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites were prospectively associated with HF risk in the two glycemic groups (follow-up 7.5 years, 137 and 94 HF cases, per-SD increase hazard ratios range 1–1.9 and 1.1–2.9), respectively. HCHS/SOL results were consistent with those from ARIC.

Metabolites known for microvascular complications were associated with cardiac dysfunction in hyperglycemic individuals but not among their euglycemic counterparts, supporting the premise that microvascular dysfunction contributes to HF pathogenesis in diabetes.

Risk of heart failure (HF) for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes is significantly higher than risk for euglycemic individuals (1,2). Insulin resistance and glycemic dysregulation can lead to alterations in cardiac structure and function. Diabetes-related cardiac functional and structural changes (referred to as cardiac dysfunction hereafter) can predict HF risk independent of hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), or valvular heart disease (3). However, the mechanisms underlying the elevated risk of HF in individuals with hyperglycemia remain only partially understood. Recent metabolomics research has shed light on the molecular pathways involved in HF development. Various metabolites, including amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids, have been linked with HF risk in the general population (4–8). Nevertheless, studies are lacking of the metabolic changes associated with cardiac dysfunction in individuals with hyperglycemia (9,10).

A better understanding of cardiac dysfunction in those with hyperglycemia will facilitate development of strategies to reduce risk of HF in this high-risk group before the advent of symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that microvascular disease significantly contributes to development of HF in people with diabetes (6,8). Therefore, we hypothesized that serum metabolites indicating microvascular dysfunction—factors involved in diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy—are more closely associated with cardiac dysfunction and HF in people with hyperglycemia than in those with normal blood glucose levels. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics profiling, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers to examine distinct metabolites (i.e., known for microvascular disease) associated with cardiac dysfunction and subsequent HF risk in older adults with and without hyperglycemia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We validated the association between cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites and risk of HF in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).

ARIC is an ongoing, prospective observational study of the natural history of atherosclerotic diseases and cardiovascular risk factors. The design and sampling of the ARIC study have previously been described (11). Briefly, individuals were recruited from four communities (Forsyth County, NC, Jackson, MS, Minneapolis, MN, and Washington County, MD) to participate in a prospective study of cardiovascular disease between 1987 and 1989. In the ARIC study 10 visits were completed from 1987 to 2023. This analysis included 6,538 participants from visit 5 (2011–2013). We excluded those with missing data for metabolites (n= 1,107), echocardiography measures (n= 95), or covariates or diabetes information (n= 727); those with prevalent HF (n= 723); and prediabetes cases without progression to diabetes (n= 1,394). The complete sample selection process for the final sample of the cross-sectional analysis (n= 2,492) is described inSupplementary Fig. 1. In the prospective analysis (n= 2,487), additionally, participants without incident HF information were excluded. The ARIC study was approved by institutional review boards, and all participants provided consent.

HCHS/SOL is a prospective community-based cohort study of 16,415 Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 18–74 years at the baseline examination (2008–2011). The cross-sectional analysis for the identification of metabolites associated with cardiac dysfunction included Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (ECHO-SOL) participants, who also had metabolomic profiling (n= 1,347) (12). The prospective analysis for association between cardiac dysfunction metabolites and risk of HF was based on 5,167 individuals (Supplementary Fig. 1). Details about the HCHS/SOL and metabolome measurements can be found inSupplementary Table 1.

ARIC visit 5 and HCHS-SOL visit 1 serum metabolites were measured and analyzed by Metabolon (Durham, NC) using four types of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectroscopy (5). Compounds were identified using library reference entries of purified standards. Recurrent unknown entities were labeled based on their combination of chromatographic properties and mass spectra. Peaks were quantified using the area under the curve. As the current study spanned multiple days, a data normalization step was performed to correct variation from instrument interday tuning differences. In ARIC, we excluded metabolites that had missing rates >25%, coefficients of variation >50%, or Spearman correlation coefficients <0.3 in blind duplicate pairs (5). In total, 790 named metabolites from ARIC visit 5 samples were included in the primary analyses. In HCHS-SOL, there are 647 metabolites shared between HCHS-SOL batch 1 and 2 with <25% missing rate and overlap with ARIC. In the SOL replication analysis, we tested metabolites for which a significant association with cardiac dysfunction was shown in ARIC (34 in the hyperglycemic group and 16 in the euglycemic group, respectively).

Hyperglycemia designation is inclusive of diabetes or prediabetes. Diabetes status was defined according to a self-reported diabetes diagnosis, fasting glucose ≧126 mg/dL, nonfasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c≧6.5%, or use of insulin or oral antidiabetes medication. Participants with prediabetes were among those without a history of diabetes, with fasting glucose 100–126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c5.7%–6.5%, or both. For this study we selected individuals who had prediabetes with known T2D progression at follow-up. Participants with controlled prediabetes or regression to euglycemia were excluded from the analysis.

In ARIC, cardiac dysfunction was measured according to echocardiographic abnormalities and elevated cardiac biomarkers, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity troponin T, according to the newly recommended definition for stage B HF (13,14). Details about the design and protocol of the ARIC visit 5 echocardiographic study and reproducibility data have previously been published (15). Laboratory methods for NT-proBNP and troponin T are described inSupplementary Table 1. In ECHO-SOL, cardiac dysfunction was measured with transthoracic echocardiography from 2011 to 2014 and was defined as at least two echocardiographic abnormalities (16). NT-proBNP and troponin T data were not available for ECHO-SOL baseline measurements.

Individual echocardiographic abnormalities included left ventricle hypertrophy according to left ventricular mass index (LVMI) ≥115 g/m2in men and ≥95 g/m2in women, left atrial enlargement as left atrial volume index (LAVI) ≥34 mL/m2, and diastolic dysfunction including E-to-e′ ratio >13, E-to-A ratio <1, E wave ≤50 cm/s, E-to-A ratio >2, E-to-A ratio <1, right ventricle systolic pressure >35 mmHg, isovolumic relaxation time >100 ms, and E-wave deceleration time >240 ms. In this study, we included a composite cardiac dysfunction outcome based on two or more echocardiographic abnormalities and one or more elevated biomarkers, including NT-proBNP >125 pg/mL for BMI ≤30 kg/m2or NT-proBNP >100 pg/mL for BMI >30 kg/m2, troponin T >14 ng/L in women and >22 ng/L in men, or both (9,17).

In ARIC, HF was defined as a new diagnosis of definite or probable acute decompensated HF. Incident HF is identified based on the first HF hospitalization or HF death from visit 5 according to ICD-9 code 428 or ICD-10 code I50, with this information obtained through active surveillance of all hospitalizations and deaths (5). The cutoff date for administrative censoring for those without events was 31 December 2020. In HCHS/SOL, hospital records for eligible HF hospitalizations were identified, obtained, and abstracted by trained abstractors. The ARIC and HCHS/SOL Mortality and Morbidity Committees independently adjudicated all abstracted cases using standardized criteria.

Sex, race, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, and medication use were self-reported. At ARIC visit 5, blood pressure was measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer by a certified trained technician using an appropriately sized cuff; data is the average of the second and third of three measurements. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured with an enzymatic assay (18). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (19). Height and weight were measured by trained personnel and used to calculate BMI. Obesity was defined according to BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Prevalent CHD was defined as having a previous myocardial infarction or revascularization, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, before visit 5.

The goals of the analysis were1) to characterize cross-sectional associations between blood metabolites and echo-based cardiac function and2) to examine the ability to associate blood metabolites with risk of incident HF exacerbation. Individual metabolites were standardized by 4 SD before the analysis. We imputed the missing value of metabolites with one-half of the lowest detected value. For values for the metabolites, the metabolites were natural logarithmically transformed and standardized at mean = 0 and SD = 1. Each metabolite was individually assessed for association with the composite cardiac dysfunction outcome by glycemic group (hyperglycemia vs. euglycemia), using logistic regression. In the models, we accounted for the following: age, combinations of race and center, sex, education, current/former smoker, current drinker, average systolic blood pressure, BMI, total cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, antihypertension medications, prevalent CHD, and lipid-lowering medications.

For metabolites that were identified to be associated with cardiac dysfunction cross-sectionally, we assessed their association with incident HF using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models, with the aforementioned covariates. To account for the multiplicity of hypothesis tests in the metabolomics analysis, we calculated false discovery rate (FDR)-adjustedPvalues using the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up FDR-controlling procedure. We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses by excluding people with CHD or chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those with prediabetes at ARIC visit 5.

Metabolites significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction were validated with use of data from HCHS/SOL (N= 5,167;n= 1,611 in the hyperglycemic group andn= 3,556 in the euglycemic group). Ongoing follow-up for incident HF events extends until 2017 (mean follow-up 7.7 years) (20).

Supplementary Table 2summarizes characteristics of the ARIC study participants with hyperglycemia (n= 1,297) or euglycemia (n= 1,195) at baseline. Mean age was 75 years for both groups. The proportion of men, non-Hispanic Black individuals, and individuals with low education attainment (high school or vocational school) was higher in the hyperglycemic group. Among the hyperglycemic group there was also a higher prevalence of common risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and higher triglycerides, and individuals taking antihypertension and lipid-lowering medications. In comparison with participants with euglycemia, those with hyperglycemia had higher troponin T levels and worse cardiac remodeling and diastolic function markers, such as higher LVMI, e′, and e-to-e′ ratio, and a higher percentage met the composite cardiac dysfunction outcome (Supplementary Table 2). In HCHS/SOL, 1,611 and 3,556 individuals with hyperglycemia and euglycemia were identified, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Compared with euglycemic individuals, the hyperglycemic group was older (age 55 vs. 45 years), with a higher prevalence of common risk factors and worse echocardiogram markers.

In ARIC, a total of 46 metabolites were significantly associated with the composite cardiac dysfunction outcome at the threshold of FDR <5%. Among these, 30 were uniquely identified in the hyperglycemic group, 12 were uniquely identified in the euglycemic group, and 4 were found in both groups (Fig. 1).

Metabolites associated with cardiac dysfunction in hyperglycemic and euglycemic groups.

Among 30 unique metabolites associated with cardiac dysfunction in the hyperglycemic group, 13 were amino acids, 6 xenobiotics, 5 nucleotides, 4 lipids, and 2 carbohydrate-derived metabolites (Figs.2Aand3A). Pseudomurein and N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, representing pyrimidine and purine metabolism, were the metabolites with the strongest association with cardiac dysfunction in the hyperglycemic group. Amino acids, including N2,N5-diacetylornithine (representing the urea cycle), N-carbamoylvaline, 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyrate, and N6-acetyllysine (representing leucine, isoleucine, and valine metabolism, respectively), C-glycosyltryptophan (representing tryptophan metabolism), N-formylmethionine (representing methionine metabolism), and N-acetylthreonine and N-acetylserine (representing glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism), were also top cardiac dysfunction–related markers in the hyperglycemic individuals (Figs.2Aand3A). These top cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites were correlated with each other (correlation coefficients range from 0.13 to 0.83) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The top cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites were significantly associated with NT-proBNP and troponin T, LVMI, LAVI, e′, and e-to-e′ ratio (Supplementary Fig. 2A).

In the euglycemic group, 12 unique metabolites were associated with cardiac dysfunction (Figs.2Band3A). Among these, two carbohydrate metabolites, erythronate and arabonate/xylonate, representing amino sugar and pentose metabolism, and one vitamin/cofactor metabolite, gulonate, representing ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, were the top three risk markers. Succinate, an indicator of tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as fatty acids–derived oleoylcholine, phospholipid-derived trimethylamine N-oxide, and phosphatidylethanolamine-derived 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPE (16:0/20:4) and 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE (16:0/18:2), were also significantly associated with the cardiac dysfunction in the euglycemic group (Figs.2Band3A). Top cardiac alteration–related metabolites were, in general, correlated with each other (correlation coefficients range from 0.09 to 0.79), except for acetylcholine (Ach) (Supplementary Fig. 2B). The top 10 cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites were also correlated with NT-proBNP and troponin T, LVMI, LAVI, e′, and e-to-e′ ratio (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

Four common metabolites, including amino acids–derived N-carbamoylvaline, N-acetylserine, and N-formylmethionine, and entose acid, were significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction outcome in both glycemic groups (Figs.2Band3B). In our sensitivity analyses, with exclusion of CHD or CKD, the metabolites associated with the cardiac dysfunction in the two glycemic groups resembled what was identified from the main analysis (Supplementary Tables 3and4). In another sensitivity analysis, excluding subjects with prediabetes, the results also resemble those of the main analysis (Supplementary Table 5).

Additionally, we identified metabolites that were associated with reduced risk of cardiac dysfunction in the two glycemic groups (Supplementary Table 6). In the hyperglycemic group (metabolitesn= 30), the cardiac function protective markers were predominantly lipid-related molecules, including three sphingomyelins (d17:2/16:0, d18:2/15:0; d18:0/20:0, d16:0/22:0; d18:2/14:0, d18:1/14:1), benzoyl dihydrosphingomyelin (d18:0/22:0), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (16:0/20:4n6), 3-hydroxy laurate, and 1-myristoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (14:0/20:4). Nucleotide-derived uridine, the peptide-derived threonylphenylalanine, and amino acid–derived N-acetylcarnosine were also negatively associated with cardiac dysfunction in the hyperglycemic group. In the euglycemic group, there were 39 metabolites representing a wide array of pathways, including lipid species, xenobiotics, amino acids, peptides, and carbohydrate metabolites (Supplementary Table 6).

Metabolites associated with cardiac dysfunction in the two glycemic groups were further examined in HCHS/SOL (n= 1,347, 34% men) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of 34 cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites in the hyperglycemic group, 30 were available for validation, and 15 of 16 in the euglycemic group were available. Six metabolites including N-acetylthreonine, N2,N5-diacetylornithine,e, 4-hydroxyhippurate, N-acetylvaline, N-formylmethionine, and 3-hydroxystachydrine were associated with cardiac dysfunction (P< 0.05) in the hyperglycemic group. In the euglycemic group, only one metabolite, succinate, was associated, marginally, with cardiac dysfunction risk. Other metabolites identified in ARIC did not show statistically significant associations in the two glycemic groups, respectively; however, the direction of the risk is generally consistent between the two cohorts (Supplementary Table 7).

During a mean follow-up of 7.5 years, 137 and 94 HF cases were identified in the hyperglycemic and euglycemic groups, respectively. Among the 46 cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites identified in the previous step (Fig. 1), 24 were significantly associated with increased risk of HF (Fig. 4AandB). In the hyperglycemic group, a 1-SD increase in cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites, including N-acetylserine, 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyrate, N2,N5-diacetylornithine, N-acetylvaline, N-formylmethionine, and N-acetyltaurine, was significantly associated with higher risk of HF after accounting for all covariates and multiple-testing adjustment (hazard ratios [HRs] range 1.0–1.9) (Fig. 4A). In the euglycemic group, increases in gluconate, erythronate, arabonate/xylonate, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE (16:0/18:2), succinate, oleoylcholine, N-carbamoylvaline, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPE (16:0/20:4), 4-acetamidobutanoate, and N-carbamoylalanine were statistically significantly associated with higher risk of HF (HRs range 1.1–2.9) (Fig. 4A). Two cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites that are common in hyperglycemic and euglycemic groups (N-formylmethionine and N-acetylserine) were also significantly associated with HF in the two glycemic groups (HRs range 1.1–2.2 and 1.1–2.0, respectively) (Fig. 4B).

Among cardiac function protective metabolites identified from the previous step, in the hyperglycemic group, sphingomyelin (d18:0/20:0, d16:0/22:0), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (16:0/20:4n6), tricosanoyl sphingomyelin (d18:1/23:0), and sphingomyelin (d18:2/18:1) were significantly associated with reduced risk of HF. In the euglycemic group, threonylphenylalanine, fibrinopeptide A (2-15), phosphoethanolamine, and ergothioneine were significantly associated with reduced risk of HF (Supplementary Table 8).

In ECHO-SOL (N= 5,167), during mean follow-up of 7.7 years, we identified 47 and 10 HF cases in the hyperglycemic and euglycemic groups, respectively. We found that all 19 of 30 cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites identified in ARIC were also available in ECHO-SOL and were significantly associated with HF risk in the hyperglycemic group. In the euglycemic group, 9 of 15 cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites identified in ARIC were also available in ECHO-SOL and were significantly associated with HF risk. The rest of the cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites did not show statistical significance. Yet, for the majority a direction of increased risk of HF was seen, which is consistent with what we observed in the ARIC study (Supplementary Table 9).

This large-scale metabolomics study, conducted across two cohorts comprising White, Black, and Hispanic Americans, revealed distinct metabolic signatures related to the pathogenesis of HF in individuals with hyperglycemia as compared with those with normal glucose metabolism. Regarding risk of cardiac dysfunction, individuals with hyperglycemia exhibited more abundant metabolites known for microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and CKD. This finding supports the concept that microvascular disease is a potent contributor to the pathogenesis of diabetes-related cardiac abnormalities (21).

In our study, altered amino acids and purine and pyrimidine metabolism are among the top metabolic signatures of the cardiac dysfunction outcome in the hyperglycemic group. Emerging research has shown that modifications of metabolites, such as glycosylation, sulfation, acetylation, and carbamoylation of amino acids and proteins, are responsible for the presence of microvascular complications in diabetes (22,23). These modifications play a role in various biological processes, such as inflammation (22–25), and abnormalities of glucose metabolism (25) or epigenetic regulation (23), all of which are involved in common pathways in the development of HF. The individual risk metabolites of which there were increased levels identified in this study, such as C-glycosyltryptophan, pseudouridine, N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylserine, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, N6-acetyllysine, N-acetylalanine, pseudouridine, and N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, were recently reported to be the significant metabolites that positively predict renal dysfunction in diabetes (26,27). In our study, higher N2,N5-diacetylornithine, a metabolite by-product of the urea cycle, was positively and significantly related to cardiac dysfunction in the hyperglycemic group. Previous research suggests that N2,N5‐diacetylornithine levels tend to accumulate due to urea cycle perturbations in subclinical renal disease, which may be accompanied by systemic microvascular and endothelial dysfunction (28). Investigators of a recent prospective cohort study reported that N2,N5‐diacetylornithine may play a significant role in predicting diastolic function and HF with preserved ejection fraction (29). Of note, in our study, increased levels of cardiac dysfunction–related metabolites, such as 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyrate, C-glycosyltryptophan, N2,N5-diacetylornithine, and N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, were positively and significantly associated with HF risk in the hyperglycemic group, highlighting their potential as predictors of overt HF.

Additionally, we found that increased levels of 3-hydroxystachydrine and stachydrine, food components/plant metabolites, were the molecules strongly correlated with the cardiac dysfunction outcome in the hyperglycemic group. However, studies investigating the relationship between stachydrine and cardiometabolic outcomes are limited, and the findings remain inconsistent (30–32). Stachydrine, a proline betaine, is a naturally occurring compound abundant in citrus fruit juices (31). Some evidence suggests that stachydrine may mitigate high glucose–induced endothelial cell senescence and SIRT1 downregulation, potentially offering protection against cardiovascular disease (30,31). However, other studies have linked it to a significantly increased risk of diabetic retinopathy (32). Due to the limited and inconclusive findings, further research is needed to clarify the roles of 3-hydroxystachydrine and stachydrine in diabetic vascular complications.

Among the euglycemic participants, we found that carbohydrate-related metabolites, including erythrocyte and carbonate/xylanase, were the top metabolites associated with risk of cardiac dysfunction. Carbohydrates are essential for the physiology, development, and metabolism of cardiac muscle tissue (myocardium). They contribute to energy production in cardiac cells, store energy as glycogen, and influence protein and lipid maturation by fueling the synthesis of nucleotide sugars (33). Erythronate and arabonate/xylonate have been associated with cancer pathogenesis (34), renal dysfunction (35), and inborn congenital heart defects (36). Interestingly, α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid cycle known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, was linked to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction in the euglycemic group. This finding contrasts with current research suggesting that α-ketoglutarate has beneficial effects on myocardial hypertrophy, remodeling, fibrosis, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pressure-overloaded hearts (37).

Oleoylcholine, an Ach metabolite, was also associated with risk of cardiac dysfunction in the euglycemic group. The Ach-mediated cholinergic system is critical in maintaining the homeostasis of cardiac physiology. Elevated Ach was associated with worse prognoses of pulmonary hypertension, including increased risk of HF and mortality (38). In addition to Ach, other lipids, including phosphatidylethanolamine (1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPE [16:0/20:4], 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE [16:0/18:2]), which are known for their adverse effect on the cardiovascular system, were significantly associated with the cardiac dysfunction outcome and consequent HF risk in the euglycemic group in our study.

Amino acids–derived N-carbamoylvaline, N-acetylserine, and N-formylmethionine are risk factors for the cardiac dysfunction outcome regardless of glycemic status. N-formylmethionine was reported to be related to HF with preserved ejection fraction in previous examinations (5). N-formylanthranilic acid is produced by tryptophan metabolism and can be biosynthesized and modified from kynurenic acid. It is a contributor to kidney disease and a predictor of kidney function decline (39).

The strengths of this study include its unprecedented sample size, heterogeneous group of study participants for whom rich phenotypic cardiac dysfunction information was available, and external cohort validation. The untargeted metabolomics profiling enabled us to extensively characterize discrete and common metabolomic signatures associated with cardiac dysfunction and HF risk in individuals with hyperglycemia or those without. However, several limitations are worth mentioning. First, regarding age, the ARIC cohort was in their 70s, and our results are representative of aging populations with diabetes. There are increased prevalence and incidence of diabetes and prediabetes among populations ages ≤50 years; validation of the analysis in a younger cohort may provide additional insights into circulating metabolites suitable for early prevention of cardiac abnormalities in those with early-onset hyperglycemia. Furthermore, data from the oral glucose tolerance test, another diagnostic criterion for diabetes, were not available for either cohort to further validate hyperglycemic status. Additionally, due to the limited HF incident cases in SOL, the estimates in the validation analysis may not be precise. Similarly, due to the small number of cases of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in our study, we were not able to provide a robust estimate of the association by HF subtype.

In summary, by leveraging two community-based cohort studies with untargeted metabolomics profiling, we identified distinct metabolic signatures associated with pathogenesis of HF in individuals with hyperglycemia, in comparison with those with normal glucose metabolism. Metabolites known to be related to retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and CKD were preferentially associated with cardiac structural and functional alterations among participants with hyperglycemia. Our findings suggest that microvascular disease significantly contributes to HF development in diabetes.
