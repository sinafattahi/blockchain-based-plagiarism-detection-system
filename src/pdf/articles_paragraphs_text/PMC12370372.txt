Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have transformed the treatment of B cell malignancies and show promise in other diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cardiac injury. However, broader application, particularly in solid tumours, is limited by challenges such as antigen escape and tumour heterogeneity. This study aimed to develop an anti‐FLAG CAR capable of engaging FLAG‐tagged secondary reagents, providing a flexible and adaptable targeting strategy.

We engineered a humanised anti‐FLAG CAR to engage FLAG‐tagged secondary reagents. The initial construct exhibited tonic signalling, which was addressed through structural optimisation. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed in solid tumour mouse models expressing either FLAG or a FLAG‐tagged secondary targeting reagent.

The initial anti‐FLAG CAR showed functional activity but exhibited tonic signalling and exhaustion, limiting its therapeutic utility. Structural optimisation significantly reduced exhaustion and improved T cell persistence and functionality. The optimised CAR T cells effectively inhibited tumour growth in models using either FLAG‐ engineered tumour cells or a FLAG‐tagged secondary targeting reagent.

Our findings underscore the importance of CAR design in minimising exhaustion and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. This work supports a modular CAR T cell platform with the potential to overcome tumour antigen heterogeneity and immune evasion in solid cancers.

This study presents a modular anti‐FLAG CAR T‐cell system that enables flexible tumor targeting through FLAG‐tagged reagents. Structural optimisation of the CAR reduced tonic signalling and glycolytic metabolism, mitigating T‐cell exhaustion.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapies have revolutionised the treatment of B‐cell haematological cancers and are regarded as one of the most potent advancements in cancer treatment.1,2In recent years, CAR T cells have also demonstrated potential in other diseases, such as autoimmune diseases,3infectious diseases4and cardiac injury,5underscoring their broad therapeutic applications.

There is a critical need for CAR T‐cell strategies that enable flexible targeting of diverse antigens. This adaptability is essential to address tumor heterogeneity and prevent antigen escape. In this study, we designed a novel humanised anti‐FLAG CAR to function in combination with FLAG‐tagged secondary reagents that specifically bind tumor‐associated antigens. Although the initial anti‐FLAG CAR demonstrated functional activity,in vitroculture revealed premature T‐cell exhaustion critically limiting its translational potential. To tackle this challenge, we implemented a structural redesign of the CAR architecture that mitigated tonic signalling, restored physiological signalling and rebalanced metabolic flux towards oxidative phosphorylation. The engineered anti‐FLAG CAR T cells demonstrated robust expansion, exhibited potent antigen‐specific cytotoxicity and secreted elevated IFN‐γ when co‐cultured with target cancer cells.

In NSG mice bearing orthotopic FLAG‐expressing MDA‐MB‐468 breast tumors, the optimised anti‐FLAG CAR T cells achieved complete tumor eradication. These CAR T cells also demonstrated potent efficacy when used in combination with a tumor‐targeting protein bearing a FLAG‐tag for CAR engagement. This modular approach offers a promising strategy for flexible targeting of diverse antigens by using FLAG‐tagged antibodies to bridge anti‐FLAG CAR T cells to tumor cells, with the FLAG epitope serving as a universal docking site to allow rapid antigen switching.

Experiments were repeated independently at least three times with consistent results, each performed in triplicate. Representative data with technical replicates were shown as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance: ****P≤ 0.0001.

The FLAG‐CAR lentiviral vector successfully transduced activated T cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), achieving a robust transduction efficiency consistently exceeding 70% at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2:1 and a balanced CD4:CD8 ratio (Figure1b). The resulting FLAG‐CAR T cells effectively exert cytotoxicity against cancer cells in an antigen‐specific manner in standardin vitrocytotoxicity assays (Figure1c).

Although the FLAG‐CAR T cells exhibited overall good functionality, we consistently observed high background killing at high Effector: Target (E:T) ratiosin vitro(Figure1c), and they also failed to expand effectivelyin vitro, unlike HER2‐CAR T cells (Figure2a and b). This limitation was not because of the MOI, as evidenced by preserved expansion kinetics across MOI ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:1 (Supplementary figure1). The FLAG‐CAR T cells also exhibited elevated exhaustion markers, including PD‐1 and LAG‐3 (Figure2c). In addition, FLAG‐CAR T cells demonstrated higher background cytotoxicity (Figure2d) and lower antigen‐specific secretion of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α (Figure2e). The lack of expansion, increased expression of exhaustion markers and decreased cytokine secretion upon activation have been frequently described as cell exhaustion and attributed to tonic signalling,14,15,16where the exhaustion‐like cell phenotype is induced by antigen‐independent clustering of CARs on T cells.

Experiments were performed independently at least twice with similar results, each with three to five replicates. Representative data are shown as mean ± SEM with three to five technical replicates. Statistical significance: **P≤ 0.01, ****P≤ 0.0001.

To confirm the FLAG‐CAR T cells were experiencing tonic signalling, we treated the FLAG‐CAR T cells with dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to rescue CAR T cells from tonic signalling.17Dasatinib functions by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways of T‐cell activation, thereby preventing continuous activation that can lead to dysfunction. Following incubation with dasatinib for 7 days, the phenotype of the FLAG‐CAR T cells was rescued (Figure2f) and cell growth restored. These findings further provide evidence that these cells undergo tonic signalling and are progressing to functional exhaustion.

To address the limitations of the FLAG‐CAR T‐cell functions, which were impaired by tonic signalling, we modified the CAR plasmid structure and generated new constructs, as illustrated in Figure3a. The original design, designated as CAR 1, served as the baseline for comparison. While the scFv region is known to play a pivotal role in altering the tonic‐signalling phenotype,14our options for modification were constrained by the limited availability of scFv sequences. We used a recently developed artificial intelligence (AI)‐based calculator, CAR‐Toner,16to assess the surface electrostatic properties of our CAR constructs by calculating the positively charged patches (PCPs) score. This score quantifies the extent of positively charged regions on the protein surface and serves as a proxy for electrostatic charge, which has been associated with CAR tonic signalling.14Interestingly, our FLAG‐CAR was not predicted to exhibit significantly greater tonic signalling than our HER2‐CAR (FLAG‐CAR score = 54; HER2‐CAR score = 49), suggesting that FLAG‐CAR is not predicted to exhibit significantly higher tonic signalling based on electrostatic surface charge alone. Therefore, we decided to retain the original humanised scFv sequence and implement changes in other parts of the FLAG‐CAR.

Experiments were performed independently at least three times with consistent results. Data are represented as mean ± SEM from technical triplicates.

Notably, HER2‐CAR T cells, which did not exhibit an exhaustion‐like phenotype, utilised a VH‐VL scFv configuration, whereas the relatively exhausted FLAG‐CAR employed a VL‐VH configuration. Thus, we redesigned the FLAG‐CARs to adopt the VH‐VL configuration. In CAR 2, we modified only the scFv structure by swapping the VH and VL chains while retaining the rest of the original design.

All six CAR constructs were successfully packaged into lentiviral vectors, achieving transduction rates exceeding 70% at an MOI of 2:1 in human T cells (Figure3b). Excitingly, all the new CARs (CAR 2–CAR 6) exhibited improved phenotypes compared to the original FLAG‐CAR (CAR 1). While only ~30% of CAR1‐transduced cells displayed a TSCM‐like phenotype, > 50% of cells transduced with CAR 2–CAR 5 and HER2‐CAR were TSCM‐like (Figure4a). The new CARs showed significantly better expansionin vitro. Similar to the non‐exhausted HER2‐CAR, the five new FLAG‐CARs expanded ~150–200 fold within 2 weeks. In contrast, CAR 1 failed to expand and eventually led to a collapse of the cell culture (Figures4b and cand2a).In vitroassays further demonstrated the superior functionality of FLAG‐CAR 3–5. These three new CAR T cells showed enhanced specific killing of FLAG+cancer cells compared to CAR 1 (Figure4d). Additionally, CAR 3 and CAR 4 T cells secreted significantly higher levels of IFN‐γ when co‐cultured with FLAG+cancer cells, further confirming their improved specificity and reduced exhaustion (Figure4e). Although CAR 2 and CAR 6 demonstrated a strong expansion rate and favorable memory phenotypein vitro, the new design did not improve the functionality of these two CARs. CAR 2 did not show any significantly enhanced effect on specific killing compared to CAR 1 (Figure4d). It maintained a high background IFN‐γ secretion level while exhibiting limited ability to secrete IFN‐γ when incubated with FLAG+cancer cells (Figure4e). This suggests ineffective activation coupled with off‐target activity. CAR 6 completely lacked both antigen‐specific cytotoxicity and cytokine response (Figure4d and e), indicating a non‐functional receptor configuration.

We next evaluated the anti‐tumor effects of the most promising CARs, CAR 3–CAR 5, using a FLAG+solid tumor model. In this model, MDA‐MB‐468 human breast cancer cells were orthotopically engrafted into the mammary glands of immunocompromised NSG mice. To simulate a solid tumor setting, where a FLAG‐tagged scFv binds the tumor antigen on the tumor cell surface, the MDA‐MB‐468 cells were transduced with a non‐functional scFv containing a C‐terminal FLAG peptide and a transmembrane domain (Supplementary figure3). This construct, which lacks antigen‐binding capacity, anchors the FLAG peptide to the tumor cell surface and is hereafter referred to as MDA‐MB‐468‐FLAG. Once established, the tumors were treated with FLAG‐CAR T cells. Remarkably, CAR 3–CAR 5 effectively inhibited the growth of orthotopic MDA‐MB‐468‐FLAG tumors in NSG mice, achieving complete eradication of the cancers (Figure5a) and extended survival (Figure5b). In contrast, the original CAR 1 that exhibited tonic signalling showed only a marginal effect on MDA‐MB‐468‐FLAG tumor progression (Figure5a). There was no overt toxicity observed in any treatment groups (Figure5c).

Among the three effective FLAG‐CARs (CAR 3, CAR 4 and CAR 5), we selected CAR 4 for further investigation because of its superiorin vitroandin vivoperformance. Although CAR 3 demonstrated strongin vivoefficacy and specific killing, it consistently exhibited high background IFN‐γ secretion (Figure4e). CAR 5 lacked IFN‐γ secretion upon co‐culture with target cancer cells (Figure4e). As shown in Supplementary figure4, no significant differences were observed among FLAG‐CAR 1, FLAG‐CAR 4 and HER2‐CAR T cells in terms of transduction efficiency, CAR surface expression or CD4+/CD8+T‐cell composition across four individual donors. These results indicate that the observed functional differences between the CAR constructs are unlikely to be as a result of variability in transduction levels or T‐cell subset distribution. Considering these factors, we prioritised CAR4 for further study to understand the mechanisms underlying its superior performance and advance its development towards clinical translation.

Additionally, ERK phosphorylation, a marker of MAPK‐driven tonic signalling,14is significantly lower in CAR 4 cells than in CAR 1, indicating reduced tonic signalling in CAR 4 (Figure6c). Upon antigen stimulation, CAR 4 cells exhibit approximately 3.5‐fold higher pERK expression than CAR 1 cells, suggesting enhanced antigen‐specific activation. Notably, this activation was even greater than that observed in HER2‐CAR cells (Figure6d). This pattern suggests that CAR 4 maintains a lower basal activation state, while retaining the capacity for robust ERK activation upon stimulation. Given the role of the MAPK pathway in metabolic regulation, this dynamic ERK response may contribute to enhanced mitochondrial function, supporting a metabolically fitter phenotype in CAR 4 compared to CAR 1 T cells.

We subsequently performed a Seahorse assay to compare the metabolism of CAR 4 and CAR 1, using HER2‐CAR as the experimental control. As HER2‐CAR differs from FLAG‐CARs in multiple domains, including scFv and hinge, it was used solely as a positive control rather than for direct comparison. Interestingly, the results revealed that the HER2‐CAR differs significantly from the FLAG‐CARs, exhibiting lower basal and maximal respiration rates, as well as a distinct extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Figure6e and f), highlighting the fundamental differences between HER2‐CAR and FLAG‐CAR T cells. Between FLAG‐CARs, CAR 4 outperformed CAR 1, demonstrating higher oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) reflecting a higher mitochondrial respiration, as reflected by an increased basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and a higher spare respiratory capacity (SRC) (Figure6g). Additionally, CAR 4 showed reduced glycolysis, as indicated by a lower ECAR. The reduced ECAR and enhanced OXPHOS indicate that CAR 4 T cells have a shift towards mitochondrial respiration for oxidative metabolism and rely less on glycolysis for energy production.24,25These data indicate that CAR 4 T cells are adopting a more efficient, oxidative metabolic state, which is often associated with enhanced mitochondrial function and overall cellular fitness. Together, our data indicate a more metabolically fit phenotype of CAR 4 than of CAR 1 T cells. The link between ERK activation and mitochondrial fitness further supports the notion that CAR 4 and anti‐HER2 CAR T cells maintain a less differentiated and energetically efficient state.

To evaluate the therapeutic potential of FLAG‐CAR 4 T cells in combination with a tumor‐targeting FLAG‐tagged reagent, we engineered a recombinant protein consisting of an anti‐HER2 scFv fused to a FLAG tag as the core targeting element (Figure7a). The construct also includes additional components, such as an Fc region and flexible linkers, to enhance structural flexibility, stability and serum half‐life. This molecule is hereafter referred to as H‐Flag (HER2‐scFv‐FLAG). H‐FLAG enabled robust and specific activation of FLAG‐CAR 4 T cells against HER2+tumor cells, resulting in potent cytotoxicity (Figure7b) and IFN‐γ secretion (Figure7c), only when both the HER2‐scFv‐FLAG and tumor antigen were present. Furthermore, in the orthotopic MDA‐MB‐468‐HER2 breast cancer model, FLAG‐CAR 4 T cells alone or the H‐FLAG alone had minimal impact on tumor growth, but their combination led to significant tumor regression (Figure7d), demonstrating the efficacy of this modular targeting strategyin vivo. No overt toxicity was observed in treated mice (Figure7e), supporting the safety of this approach.

Overall, our data showed that the optimised CAR 4 T cells outperform CAR 1 T cells. The CAR structure itself likely influences intracellular signalling, which in turn shapes the metabolic profile of CAR T cells, ultimately affecting theirin vitrofunction andin vivotherapeutic performance. Furthermore, the use of an H‐FLAG protein enabled modular redirection of FLAG‐CAR T cells towards HER2+tumors, resulting in effective tumor clearance. These findings highlight the versatility and therapeutic potential of the anti‐FLAG CAR platform in enabling flexible targeting of solid tumors.

CAR T‐cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating haematological malignancies, but its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited because of major challenges like antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss. Unlike blood cancers, where a single antigen is typically uniformly expressed, solid tumors show high variability in antigen expression both across tumor types and within individual tumors, making target identification difficult and increasing the risk of treatment failure. Additionally, antigen loss is a significant challenge, as tumor cells can downregulate or mutate the targeted antigen to evade immune recognition, a process facilitated by genomic instability and clonal diversity. These factors contribute to treatment resistance, tumor recurrence and poor therapeutic outcomes, underscoring the need for strategies that enable flexible and broad targeting of tumor antigens.

To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored targeting exogenous antigens and using modular CAR systems that allow adaptable antigen recognition. One approach employs a CAR specific to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), used in combination with an intratumorally injected amphiphile conjugated to FITC to treat solid tumors.26This enhances CAR T‐cell infiltration and promotes systemic anti‐tumor immunity, including abscopal effects and immune memory formation. Other universal CAR strategies include the SUPRA (split, universal and programmable) CAR27and convertible CAR.28These systems separate the CAR recognition from antigen specificity, using adaptor molecules to guide CAR T cells to different antigens. For instance, the SUPRA CAR uses a leucine zipper‐based adaptor system, while convertible CAR employs an inert NKG2D domain that binds to ULBP2‐based adaptors fused to tumor‐targeting antibodies. These designs enable controlled and flexible targeting of diverse antigens and allow for rapid reprogramming of CAR specificity.

Our initial FLAG‐CAR design showed evidence of tonic signalling, leading to T‐cell exhaustion. To address this, several structural modifications were tested, including domain reordering, hinge shortening and substitution of costimulatory domains.14,15,16,21The optimised CAR, which is CAR 4, featured a truncated version of the hCD8α hinge and showed reduced tonic signalling, improved metabolic fitness and enhanced effector function. CAR4 successfully eliminated FLAG‐expressing breast cancer in the mouse models. Moreover, when used in combination with a FLAG‐tagged HER2‐scFv, CAR 4 induced significant regression of orthotopic HER2+tumors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this flexible targeting strategy.

In summary, this study establishes the FLAG‐CAR as a flexible and modular platform for CAR T‐cell therapy. By addressing tonic signalling and improving T‐cell function, the optimised FLAG‐CAR demonstrates effective anti‐tumor activity. The combination of FLAG‐tagged tumor‐targeting moieties with FLAG‐CAR offers a potential strategy for adaptable redirection towards diverse tumor‐associated antigens.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from fresh buffy coats supplied by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service and isolated using a Ficoll density gradient. The PBMCs were then cultured in TexMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co. KG, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) supplemented with recombinant human IL‐7 and IL‐15 (Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co. KG) at 12.5 ng mL−1and T‐cell TransAct (Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co. KG) at a 1:100 dilution. After 48 h, the activated T cells were transduced with concentrated CAR lentiviral vectors and subsequently maintained in TexMACS medium containing 12.5 ng mL−1of recombinant human IL‐7 and IL‐15.

CAR T constructs were synthesised by Genscript Singapore and cloned to pCDH vector (Addgene, Watertown, USA). The CAR T plasmids were mixed with pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV‐Rev and pMD2.G plasmids (Addgene) and transfected into HEK 293 T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Supernatant containing the CAR lentiviral vectors was harvested, concentrated by ultracentrifugation with Optima XPN‐100 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA), titrated and stored at −80°C.

Chimeric antigen receptor T cells were seeded to 96‐well flat‐bottom plates with an equal number of tumor cells in complete RPMI and incubated at 37°C overnight. Supernatant was collected, and cytokines were analysed using the AlphaLISA kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (Revvity, Waltham, USA). Plates were read on the BioTek Cytation 5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA).

Cell surface flow cytometric analysis was performed as previously described.11,12,13For intracellular staining, FLAG‐ or HER2‐CAR T cells were incubated with NALM6‐FLAG or NALM6‐HER2, respectively, at a 1:1 ratio in RPMI containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 30 min in a 37°C water bath. At the end of incubation, samples were immediately fixed in 1:1 volume of BD Cytofix for 10 min at room temperature, then permeabilised in methanol for 10 min on ice. Samples were stained with anti‐ERK1/2 phospho (T202/Y204) antibody (clone 6B8B69, BioLegend, San Diego, USA) in buffer [phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% FBS and 0.09% sodium azide] for 1 h in the dark on ice. Samples were analysed on BD FACSCanto II, BD LSR II, BD LSRFortessa X‐20, BD FACSymphony A3 or A5 (BD Bioscience, San Diego, USA). Data are analysed and plotted using FlowJo™ v10.10 (BD Bioscience).

All mouse experiments were approved by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. NOD.Cg‐Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl/SzJ mice (NSG) were bred at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia), and mice used for experiments were between 6 and 10 weeks of age. Experiments were conducted using a mixed cohort of male and female mice based on availability.

In the xenograft models, 1 × 106MDA‐MB‐468‐FLAG cells in 20 μL PBS were injected into the left fourth mammary glands. Tumor areas were measured with a calliper twice per week and calculated as length × width. In the tumor growth and survival study, mice received 0.5 Gy total body irradiation 15 days following tumor injection and on the same day, 2 × 106CAR T cells were injected intravenously in 200 μL PBS. In the mechanistic study, mice received 0.5 Gy total body irradiation 28 days after tumor injection, followed by intravenous injection of 5 × 106CAR T cells in 200 μL PBS. Mice were harvested 7 days after CAR T‐cell treatment. Tumors were enzymatically digested at 37°C for 20 min with 1 mg mL−1Collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, USA), 100 μg mL−1Hyaluronidase and 75 μg mL−1DNase I (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in RPMI‐1640 medium before mechanical dissociation through a 70‐μm cell strainer. Spleens were mechanically dissociated through a 70‐μm cell strainer before red blood cell lysis. Cell suspensions were used for surface staining and analysed by flow cytometry as described above.

To assess thein vivoefficacy of the FLAG‐CAR 4 T cells in combination with the H‐FLAG protein (synthesised by GenScript, Nanjing, China), NSG mice (6–8 weeks of age) were orthotopically injected with 1 × 106MDA‐MB‐468‐HER2 tumor cells into the fourth mammary fat pad. Thirteen days after the tumor injection, mice were randomly assigned into four treatment groups: (1) untreated control, (2) FLAG‐CAR 4 T cells alone, (3) H‐FLAG alone and (4) FLAG‐CAR 4 T cells plus H‐FLAG. Mice received a single intravenous injection of 5 × 106FLAG‐CAR4 T cells, with or without co‐administration of 200 μg H‐FLAG on treatment days 0, 7 and 18 for a total of 3 doses. Tumor area and body weight were monitored twice per week using digital callipers and a standard formula (length × width). Mice were euthanised when tumors exceeded ethical limits or at the study endpoint.

Live GFP+CAR‐T cells were incubated with anti‐MYC‐AF647 (clone 9B11; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, USA) and anti‐CD3‐PE (clone SK7; BioLegend, San Diego, USA) antibodies for 30 min at room temperature and imaged using a Lattice Lightsheet microscope (Carl Zeiss AG; Oberkochen, Germany). Fluorescence signals were split using a 640‐nm long‐pass dichroic mirror and filtered with a 495–550‐nm bandpass for PE/GFP and a 570–620‐nm bandpass for AF647. Five images for each group were acquired. The membrane areas expressing CAR (MYC‐AF647+) were quantified using Imaris software (v10.1; Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, England). Images were pre‐processed to subtract background, and masks were generated for each channel using identical thresholding and voxel minimum parameters across all samples to ensure consistency. Cell surfaces were segmented based on cytoplasmic GFP, and MYC‐AF647 signal was confined to these segmented surfaces. Intensity measurements and spatial distribution analyses were performed using the Statistics and Spots tools, with voxel size calibrated to acquisition settings.

4 × 105/well of CAR T cells were seeded to XFe96 cell culture microplates pre‐coated with CellTak (Corning, New York, USA) in XF base media containing 11 mM glucose, 2 mM L‐glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The OCR and ECAR were measured by using the Seahorse XF Pro analyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) at baseline and after sequential injection of oligomycin (1 μM; Merck Life Science, Bayswater, Australia), FCCP (1.5 μM; Merck Life Science), rotenone (100 nM; Merck Life Science) and antimycin A (1 μM; Merck Life Science).

Data were analysed and graphed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Albuquerque, USA). One‐way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test or Dunnett's multiple comparisons test were used to compare groups of data. Student'st‐test was employed to compare two groups of data. Mouse survival was compared using the Mantel‐Cox test. Significant differences between comparisons were indicated byP‐values (* ≤ 0.05, ** ≤ 0.01, *** ≤ 0.001, **** ≤ 0.0001), not significant (ns).
