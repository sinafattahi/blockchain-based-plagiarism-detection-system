Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are a major cause of antibiotic use among under-five (U5) children, often leading to inappropriate prescriptions that contribute to antimicrobial resistance, adverse drug reactions and higher healthcare costs.

A retrospective review of medical records (case folders and prescription sheets) was conducted for U5 children diagnosed with ARI over a 10-month period at the paediatric outpatient and inpatient units, Department of Paediatrics, UDUTH. Data extracted included patient sociodemographic characteristics, ARI diagnosis based on Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses/WHO criteria and antibiotic/medication details (class, name, route, dose, frequency, duration and regimen). Analysis was performed using SPSS V.20.0; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 2140 drugs and 1545 antibiotics were prescribed, averaging 2.2 and 1.6 per patient, respectively. Upper respiratory tract infections accounted for 66.2% of antibiotic indications. The antibiotic prescription rate was 100.0 %, with 71.0% administered parenterally. Most prescriptions used generic names (96.5%) and were listed in the National Essential Medicines List (100%). Cephalosporins were most frequently prescribed (46.4%), followed by penicillins; fluoroquinolones were least prescribed (1.2%). Mono-antibiotic therapy was used in 53.2% of cases. Notably, 81.5% of prescriptions came from second-line therapies. Appropriate prescribing was observed for duration (93.6%), dose (66.0%), frequency (69.7%) and indication/choice (66.5%).

Despite encouraging adherence to appropriate antibiotic dosage regimen, the high rate of antibiotic prescription, parenteral antibiotic administration and alternative antibiotic use highlights ongoing concerns with risk of resistance, adverse effects and treatment failure. Strengthening antibiotic stewardship and adherence to first-line guidelines is crucial to optimise ARI treatment in resource-limited settings.

Antibiotics are frequently overprescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs), particularly in low- and middle-income countries, despite most ARIs being viral and self-limiting. However, there is limited data from Northwestern Nigeria on the prescribing pattern, appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for paediatric ARIs using WHO and national guidelines.

This study reveals significant gaps in antibiotic prescribing for under-five with ARIs, including high antibiotic prescribing rate (100%), deviations in recommended dosing regimen, antibiotic choice and over-reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, frequent use of second-line agents, non-guideline recommended antibiotics and add-ons like azithromycin and cotrimoxazole in cases where they were not indicated was common.

These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions such as prescriber education, improved dissemination of WHO ARI treatment guidelines and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes. This study provides baseline data to guide policy reforms and future quality improvement efforts in paediatric antibiotic use.

About 3.5% of the global disease burden is caused by acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs).1Under-five (U5) children experience approximately 6–8 episodes of ARI per year, accounting for about 30–50% of hospital visits, 20–40% of outpatient consultations and 30–40% of hospital admissions. ARIs contribute to approximately 70% of morbidity among U5 children in developing countries.2This makes ARI one of the major causes of hospital admission and referrals among children, and it is responsible for at least 6% of the world’s disability and death—resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality.3Consequently, ARI remains one of the most common indications for antibiotic therapy.

Despite the public health significance and global burden of ARI, there is a paucity of research on the pattern of antibiotic prescriptions, antibiotic prescription rate (APR) and the appropriateness of antibiotic use for ARI in U5 children, particularly in this region. Although a previous study by Aminuet alat the same centre explored antibiotic prescribing patterns among paediatric outpatients, it did not assess the appropriateness of antibiotic use against standard treatment guidelines.13In contrast, the present study comprehensively evaluates both the rate and appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions based on key parameters—indication, choice, dose, frequency and duration in line with the WHO/PAN guidelines for ARI management. Additionally, this study incorporates data from both the paediatric outpatient and emergency paediatric units (EPUs), providing a broader and more representative analysis of prescribing practices. This distinction addresses an important knowledge gap and contributes more robust evidence to inform antibiotic stewardship efforts and policy recommendations in similar low-resource settings.

Determine the pattern and rate of antibiotic prescriptions.

Evaluate their appropriateness based on the WHO and PAN guidelines for ARI treatment among U5 children receiving care at the paediatric outpatient and EPUs of the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH), Sokoto.

This was a retrospective descriptive study with data collected over a 10-month period (1 September 2021–1 July 2022). The study was conducted in the Department of Paediatrics, UDUTH, Sokoto State, Northwestern Nigeria. UDUTH is a tertiary referral centre providing care for patients from Sokoto and neighbouring states including Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina and Niger. The paediatrics department runs regular outpatient clinics (Monday to Friday) and offers 24-hour inpatient and emergency paediatric care for children aged 0–15 years.

All children aged 2 months to 5 years, admitted through the EPU or seen in the paediatric outpatient department (POPD) with a clinical diagnosis of ARI and who received treatment were included (prescribed at least one antibiotic) in the study.

ARI diagnoses were made based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)/WHO guidelines, which are routinely used in clinical decision-making in these facilities.

Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI):10Cough, runny nose, low-grade fever, without fast breathing or chest in-drawing.

Pneumonia: Cough or difficulty breathing with fast breathing (≥50 breaths/min for 2–12 months; ≥40 breaths/min for 1–5 years).

Severe pneumonia: Cough or difficulty breathing with one or more general danger signs: inability to drink/breastfeed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lethargy/unconsciousness, chest in-drawing or stridor in a calm child.

Missing or incomplete clinical information (eg, age, diagnosis or treatment data).

ARI cases not treated with antibiotics (ie, prescriptions without antibiotics).

No patient involved. This was a retrospective study using case folders and treatment sheets. As such, patients and the public were not involved in the design, recruitment or conduct of the study, nor in the dissemination of its results.

Records of eligible children seen and/or admitted between 1 September 2021 and 1 July 2022 were retrieved from EPU and POPD admission registers, which contained patient identifiers, sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis and admission/discharge details. Additional clinical and prescription information was extracted manually from patient’s case notes and prescription sheets, including type and number of drugs prescribed (antibiotic and other medication), antibiotic name, dose, route, frequency and duration, use of generic versus brand names, classification of antibiotics according to WHO/PAN guideline, adherence to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). Only prescriptions meeting the inclusion criteria and containing at least one antibiotic were analysed.

The authors were directly involved in manual retrieval, review and data extraction from patient case notes and prescription sheets. A standard pro forma was used to ensure consistency during data collection.

Appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions was assessed according to the WHO/PAN guidelines for ARI management in children, which outline recommended first-line and second-line therapies based on ARI classification and severity (table 1).9 10These were used to evaluate: indication, choice of antibiotic, dose, frequency, route of administration, duration of therapy.

This table summarises first-line and alternative antibiotic regimens recommended by the PAN and WHO for the management of ARI in U5 children, stratified by age, comorbidity and care setting (table 1).

Dose: the amount of drug administered at each administration.

Frequency: how often the drug is administered per day.

Adequate recommendation: All parameters (dose, frequency and duration) appropriate.

Under-recommended: Appropriate antibiotic but dose regimen below recommendation.

Over-recommended: Appropriate antibiotic but dose regimen above recommendation.

Not recommended antibiotic: Antibiotics not endorsed by the WHO/PAN guideline for ARI management.

Data were entered and analysed using SPSS V.23. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse sociodemographic characteristics variables such as age (summarised using median and IQR) and sex (expressed as frequencies and percentages). Types/patterns of ARI diagnosed and classes of antibiotics prescribed were also presented as frequencies and percentages and presented in tables. Differences in age group distribution and sex in children with ARI were tested for statistical significance using χ². A p value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Prescriptions were categorised as appropriate or inappropriate dose regimen, first-line, alternative and add-ons antibiotic use were expressed as frequencies and percentages,and presented in tables and charts accordingly.

During the study period, 964 U5 children were diagnosed with ARI. Of these, 749 (77.7%) were aged <36 months, an age range of 2–59 months and median age of 22 months,IQR of 14–33 months. Males accounted for 51.3% (495) and females 48.7% (469), giving a male-to-female ratio of 1.05:1. There was a statistically significant association between age/sex and ARI occurrence (χ² = 28.055, p<0.001) (table 2).

Nearly two-thirds of total ARI consultations were conducted in the EPU, accounting for 616 out of 964 cases (63.9%). URTI constituted the majority of ARI cases overall, with 638 out of 964 cases (66.2%). A total of 285 out of 326 LRTI cases (87.4%) were seen at the EPU, while 307 out of 348 URTI cases (88.2%) presented at the POPD, indicating that LRTI was more frequently seen in the EPU and URTI was the predominant presentation at the POPD (table 3).

A total of 964 prescriptions were analysed, comprising 616 from the EPU and 348 from the POPD. All included prescriptions contained at least one antibiotic. Across these, 2140 drugs were prescribed, out of which 1545 (72.2%) were antibiotics. Parenteral antibiotics accounted for the majority (71.0%) of all antibiotic prescriptions. The average number of drugs and antibiotics per prescription was 2.2 and 1.6, respectively.

Most antibiotics were prescribed using their generic names (96.5%), and all drugs were selected from the NLEM. Patterns of coprescription with other drugs such as anti-inflammatories and antihistamines varied between settings (table 4).

Cephalosporins were the most common antibiotic prescribed accounting for nearly half (46.4%) of the total antibiotic prescriptions and more than half (51.8%) of the inpatient prescriptions, with ceftriaxone constituting one-fifth of all the prescriptions, while fluoroquinolones were the least (1.2%). Oral penicillin (40.5%) was the major antibiotic prescribed on an outpatient basis, contributing to over one-fifth (21.3%) of all prescriptions (table 5).

The duration for prescribed antibiotics was from 5 to 15 days, with almost all (93.6%) of the antibiotics prescribed at adequate recommended duration for ARI therapy, except azithromycin. More than two-thirds (69.7%) of the antibiotics were prescribed with adequate recommended frequency/interval of administration, while less than one-third (30.3%) of the antibiotics were prescribed with under-recommended frequency. Similarly, two-thirds (66.0%) of the antibiotics’ dosage was adequately prescribed, while nearly one-third (34.0%) had an under-recommended and over-recommended dosage. Inappropriate choice of antibiotics accounted for 33.5% of the total prescriptions (not recommended and add-on antibiotics) (table 6).

URTIs accounted for about two-thirds of antibiotic prescriptions for ARI. Most ARI consultations occurred in the EPU, similar to studies in Nepal and Pakistan.20 21This is expected, as most ARIs begin as mild URTIs that, if untreated or poorly treated, may progress to LRTIs.22Conversely, some studies reported higher antibiotic prescriptions for LRTIs.14 23Those studies included bronchial asthma under LRTIs, which was excluded in our study, resulting in fewer LRTI cases.

All prescriptions in this study contained antibiotics, with an APR of 100%. This is significantly higher than the WHO recommended range of 20–26.8% and 13.4–26.1%, respectively.24Locally, similar patterns have been reported: Adisaet alobserved an APR of 98.9% among U5 children in Ibadan, despite only 42.2% of cases showing clinical justification for antibiotics.25Onuboguet alfound that 83% of cough-related visits in Port Harcourt resulted in antibiotic prescriptions, with guideline compliance below 50%.26These data suggest a persistent culture of empiric and potentially inappropriate antibiotic use across Nigerian paediatric outpatient settings.

Incomplete or missing records/investigations have contributed to not being able to analyse some important data leading to the exclusion of these folders from the study.

Additionally, patient compliance with prescribed antibiotics could not be assessed, as data were obtained solely from medical records. Consequently, this study focused exclusively on prescribing patterns and guideline-based appropriateness, without evaluating treatment outcomes or adherence.

Future studies should incorporate pharmacoeconomic analyses to assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prescribing practices and their financial burden on both the healthcare system and patients, particularly in resource-limited settings.

While the study revealed a high APR and reliance on alternative therapies, it also demonstrated encouraging levels of appropriate prescribing in terms of duration, dosing, frequency and indication/choice. These findings indicate a moderate level of rational prescribing. However, the persistent overuse of antibiotics—particularly broad-spectrum and second-line agents—raises concerns about increased risks of antibiotic-related adverse effects, AMR and treatment failure. Strengthening antibiotic stewardship programmes and promoting adherence to first-line guidelines are urgently needed to optimise ARI treatment and protect child health in resource-limited settings.
