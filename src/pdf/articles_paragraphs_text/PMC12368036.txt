Particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) remains a persistent environmental challenge in upper Northern Thailand. This study aimed to investigate whether exposure to PM2.5 during radiotherapy influences treatment-related acute toxicities and survival outcomes in cervical cancer patients. We retrospectively reviewed data from 411 cervical cancer patients diagnosed between 2013 and 2018 at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital. Clinical data were obtained from medical records and the Chiang Mai Cancer Registry. Mean daily PM2.5 exposure during radiotherapy period was estimated using the data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Acute toxicity parameters, including gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), and hematologic (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) toxicities, were analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. Survival outcomes–including locoregional control, distant metastasis, disease-free survival, and overall survival–were estimated using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Most patients (90%) had locally advanced disease, and nearly 80% received brachytherapy and chemotherapy. Patients exposed to mean daily PM2.5 levels above 25had a significantly increased risk of developing GU toxicity (adjusted odds ratio 2.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3–4.2;p< 0.01). In contrast, PM2.5 exposure was not significantly associated with GI or hematologic toxicities, nor with differences in locoregional control, distant metastasis, disease-free survival, or overall survival. These findings suggest that daily PM2.5 exposure more than 25is associated with a higher incidence of acute GU toxicity.

Cervical cancer, primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection1and is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries2, remains a major global health concern. Globally, approximately 660,000 new cases of cervical cancer and roughly 350,000 deaths were reported in 2022, which was the fourth most common cancer among women3. In Thailand, it was the fourth most common cancer in women with 8,662 new cases (9.3% of cancer in women) in 20224.

While numerous studies has focused on the biological mechanisms5, risk factors6–8, and treatments9–12for cervical cancer, there is a growing recognition that environmental and lifestyle factors can influence cancer outcomes. Cigarette smoking, for instance, has been consistently associated to increased treatment-related toxicities13,14and poorer survival outcomes15,16. Although the adverse effects of smoking on treatment toxicity are well established, data on the impact of PM2.5 exposure on radiation-induced toxicities in cervical cancer remain limited.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)–defined as airborne particles with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers–has emerged as an important environmental concern in Northern Thailand over the past decade. Seasonal biomass burning and forest fires during the dry season (January–April) lead to periodic spikes in PM2.5 levels often reaching to unhealthy to hazardous categories17,18. In 2021, Chiang Mai, a major province in Northern Thailand, reported an mean PM2.5 concentration of 83.3, with peak hourly levels exceeding 200–300, resulting in severe smog episodes19. During such periods, Chiang Mai has frequently ranked among the most polluted cities globally. Projections for the 2020s suggest that, without effective mitigation, dry-season PM2.5 levels could routinely range from 40 to 400on peak days, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions20.

Given this context, this study aimed to investigate the association between ambient PM2.5 exposure and treatment-related toxicities, as well as survival outcomes, in a cohort of cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital between 2013 and 2018. Our primary objective was to determine whether higher PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased rates of gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), and hematologic toxicities (including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) during radiotherapy. A secondary objective was to explore the impact of PM2.5 on locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates.

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in uterine cervical cancer patients who received radiotherapy treatment at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018 and were subsequently followed up. Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, located in Chiang Mai, serves as the central hub for cancer treatment and research in Northern Thailand, encompassing eight provinces, namely, Chiang Rai, Mae-Hong-Son, Chiang Mai, Phayao, Lamphun, Lampang, Phrae, and Nan. Patients were identified through medical records and Chiang Mai Cancer Registry.

The inclusion criteria consisted of non-metastatic, pathologically confirmed uterine cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy with curative intent, either in the post-operative or definitive setting. Exclusion criteria included histopathology other than squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma; metastatic disease at diagnosis; incomplete treatment or lack of follow-up; recurrent disease; or absence of radiotherapy.

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee No.4, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University (Approval No. 200/2021), which also waived the requirement for informed consent due to the retrospective nature of the study and use of de-identified patient data. This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment details, treatment related toxicities, and survival outcomes were collected from medical records and the cancer registry. For this study, staging was updated according to the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification and grouped into two categories: early-stage disease (IA2, IB1, IB2, IIA1) and locally advanced stage disease (IB3, IIA2, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC1, IIIC2, IVA).

Cervical cancer patients were treated with either definitive radiotherapy or adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery. Treatment involved whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT), with extension to include the para-aortic area or inguinal lymph nodes in cases of para-aortic lymph node involvement or tumor extension to the lower third of the vagina. Radiotherapy was delivered using conventional techniques, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with conventional fractionation (1.8–2 Gy per fraction) to a total dose of 45–56 Gy.

Concurrent chemotherapy with platinum-based regimens, either weekly cisplatin or weekly carboplatin, was administered to patients with locally advanced disease undergoing definitive treatment and to those with adverse pathological features (e.g., positive margins, parametrial extension, or metastatic pelvic lymph nodes) receiving adjuvant treatment. Brachytherapy, delivered using either point-based (2D) or CT/MRI volumetric-based (3D), was provided for patients with positive vaginal margins after surgery or as part of definitive radiotherapy.

Acute toxicities during radiotherapy, including GI, GU, and hematologic (including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) side effects, were evaluated according to the RTOG Common Toxicity Criteria21. GI toxicities included changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, rectal discomfort, and bleeding. GU toxicities included urinary frequency, dysuria, urgency, bladder spasms, pelvic pain, and hematuria. Hematologic toxicities were evaluated based on reductions in blood counts. Toxicities were classified as Grade 0–5 according to severity and required clinical intervention.

Following completing radiotherapy, patients were scheduled for follow-up at six weeks, followed by every three months for the first year, every four months in the second year, every six months in the third and fourth years, and annually thereafter.

We obtained the PM2.5 monitoring data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which provided data on aerosols and chemical aspects from the three-dimensional time-consistent atmospheric composition fields22,23. Exposure data were retrieved for the location of Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, where all patients underwent radiotherapy. Because radiotherapy for cervical cancer typically involves daily treatment sessions over a period of 5 to 8 weeks, patients from distant provinces commonly stay in temporary accommodation near the hospital for practical reasons, facilitating daily attendance. Consequently, hospital-based PM2.5 measurements reasonably reflect the actual exposure experienced by patients during their radiotherapy course. The data were matched with each patient’s radiotherapy treatment period at the hospital, and the mean daily PM2.5 exposure was calculated and used in the statistical analysis.

Baseline characteristics that were categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, while the continuous variables were reported as the median and interquartile ranges (IQRs). A chi-square testwas used to verify the association between baseline characteristics and toxicities during treatment.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between toxicities and PM2.5 exposure levels during treatment and adjusting for age, cancer stage, surgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and relevant patient characteristics including comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes mellitus), body mass index (BMI), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The results of the univariate and multivariate analyses were presented with odds ratio (OR), adjusted OR (aOR), and 95% confidence interval (CI).

The LRC, DM, DFS, and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, stratified by PM2.5 exposure levels. Survival outcomes were compared between PM2.5 exposure groups using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), with the same covariates as in the logistic regression models. Follow-up began at the start of radiotherapy treatment and continued until the occurrence of the event of interest or the last follow-up.

To assess the robustness of findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses focusing on the association between PM2.5 exposure and acute toxicities. We modeled PM2.5 exposure as a continuous variable (mean daily exposure in), scaled by 10 units to enhance interpretability. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used, adjusted for the same covariates as the primary analysis.

A cutoffp-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Age was categorized into quartiles for appropriate dichotomization. Maximum toxicities during radiotherapy were grouped into two categories: grade 0 toxicity and grade 1 or higher toxicity. PM2.5 exposure levels were classified based on the recommended annual air quality guideline (AQG) of 2524. All analyses were performed using STATA version 12.

A total of 482 cervical cancer patients were initially identified. After excluding 71 patients, 411 patients were included in the final analysis (Fig.1). The median age was 54.0 years (IQR: 45.0–61.0). The median PM2.5 exposure level was 19.1(IQR 13.7–33.7). A small proportion of patients reported a history of smoking (3.2%) or alcohol use (0.7%). The majority of patients (90.0%) were diagnosed with locally advanced stage cervical cancer, while 10.0% had early-stage disease. Histologically, 81.3% of patients had squamous cell carcinoma, followed by 16.0% with adenocarcinoma, and 2.7% with adenosquamous carcinoma.

Regarding treatment, 26.0% of patients underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, while 74.0% received definitive radiotherapy. Brachytherapy was performed in 78.3% of patients. Chemotherapy was administered in 78.6% of cases, primarily with weekly cisplatin (n = 297, 92.0%), while weekly carboplatin was used in 8.0% of patients (n = 26) (Table1).

Baseline characteristics of the study population ().

The chi-square test identified associations between baseline characteristics and various toxicities (Table2). GI toxicity was not significantly associated with any baseline characteristic. GU toxicity was significantly associated with brachytherapy (p= 0.04) and PM2.5 exposure greater than 25(p< 0.01). Hematologic toxicities showed distinct associations among subcategories: anemia was significantly associated with cancer stage (p< 0.01), surgery (p< 0.01), and brachytherapy (p< 0.01). Leukopenia was significantly associated with chemotherapy (p< 0.01) and brachytherapy (p= 0.04). Thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with age (p= 0.04) and chemotherapy (p= 0.04).

PM2.5 exposure greater than 25was associated with higher GU toxicity in both univariate (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.3–3.9,p) and multivariate analyses (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.3,p<0.01), after adjusting for age, cancer stage, surgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes mellitus), BMI, and GFR.

For GI toxicity, the aOR was 1.2 (95% CI 0.8–1.9,p= 0.35). The aORs for hematologic toxicities were 0.8 (95% CI 0.5–1.6,p= 0.57) for anemia, 0.7 (95% CI 0.4–1.1,p= 0.11) for leukopenia, and 1.0 (95% CI 0.4–2.4,p= 0.94) for thrombocytopenia (Table3).

With a median follow-up of 5.2 years (IQR 1.9–6.5), the 5-year LRC rate was 97.9% (95% CI 95.0–99.1) in patients with PM2.525 and 97.5% (95% CI 92.3–99.2) in those with PM2.5 >25 (p= 0.51). In the Cox proportional hazards model, PM2.5 >25was not significantly associated with locoregional failure, with an unadjusted HR of 1.55 (95% CI 0.42–5.76,p= 0.52) and an HR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.41–5.82,p= 0.53), after adjusting for age, cancer stage, surgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes mellitus), BMI, and GFR.

The 5-year DM rate was 17.1% (95% CI 12.8–22.7) in the PM2.525group and 16.8% (95% CI 11.1–24.8) in the PM2.5 >25group (p= 0.76). PM2.5 levels were not significantly associated with DM in the Cox model, with an unadjusted HR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.55–1.55,p= 0.76) and an adjusted HR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.53–1.52,p= 0.68).

The 5-year DFS rate was 63.3% (95% CI 57.0–68.9) in the PM2.525group and 64.4% (95% CI 55.9–72.2) in the PM2.5 >25group (p= 0.82). The unadjusted HR for DFS was 0.96 (95% CI 0.69–1.34,p= 0.82), and the adjusted HR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.69–1.36,p= 0.87).

Similarly, the 5-year OS rate was 64.9% (95% CI 58.7–70.5) in patients with PM2.525and 65.5% (95% CI 56.9–73.2) in those with PM2.5 >25(p= 0.92). The Cox analysis showed no significant difference in OS, with an unadjusted HR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.70–1.38,p= 0.92) and an adjusted HR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.72–1.43,p= 0.94) (Fig.2).

To further evaluate the robustness of our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by modeling PM2.5 exposure as a continuous variable (mean daily exposure in). For ease of interpretation, PM2.5 values were scaled per 10increment. All models were adjusted for the same covariates as the main analysis.

Consistent with the primary analysis, higher PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of genitourinary (GU) toxistatisticallycity in both univariable (OR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.0–1.3;p= 0.02) and multivariable analyses (aOR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.1–1.4;p< 0.01). No significant associations were found between continuous PM2.5 exposure (per 10increment) and GI, or any hematologic toxicities (allp> 0.05) in both univariable and multivariable models (Table4).

This study investigated the impact of PM2.5 exposure on treatment-related acute toxicities and survival outcomes in cervical cancer patients in Northern Thailand, using retrospective data from 411 patients. Our analysis focused on GI, GU, and hematologic toxicities (subdivided into anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) in patients receiving radiotherapy. We found that patients exposed to mean daily PM2.5 levels exceeding 25experienced a significantly higher risk of GU toxicity. In contrast, PM2.5 exposure was not significantly associated with GI toxicity, hematologic toxicities, LRC, DM, DFS, or OS.

To evaluate the robustness of our primary findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which PM2.5 exposure was treated as a continuous variable rather than dichotomized. The results remained consistent, with increased PM2.5 exposure significantly associated with a higher risk of GU toxicity, further supporting the observed relationship. These findings suggest that even incremental increases in PM2.5 concentration may influence acute GU toxicity during radiotherapy, emphasizing the clinical relevance of environmental exposures during cancer treatment.

The observed association between elevated PM2.5 and increased acute GU toxicity may be explained by the systemic effects of fine particulate matter. PM2.5 is known to induce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress and impair tissue oxygenation, all of which can compromise the repair of normal tissues following radiotherapy25–27. These mechanisms may render the genitourinary tract particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced damage, as similarly reported in studies linking smoking–a known source of particulate matter–to increased toxicity in pelvic radiotherapy13,14. However, it is important to recognize that acute GU toxicity is multifactorial, influenced not only by PM2.5 exposures but also by patient-related factors (e.g., age, comorbidities) and treatment-related variables such as chemotherapy and radiation dose to the urinary structures28,29.

In contrast, the lack of a significant association between PM2.5 exposure and GI or hematologic toxicities in our cohort likely reflects the multifactorial nature of these outcomes with a lower sensitivity of these systems to PM2.5 exposure. Previous research has demonstrated that GI toxicity in cervical cancer patients is influenced by factors such as lower body mass index, diabetes, race, and smoking status30, and hematologic toxicities to treatment modalities including surgery, radiation to bone marrow, and chemotherapy31–34. Thus, our findings may be partly due to confounding factors or limitations in our exposure assessment methods.

The association between elevated PM2.5 exposure and increased acute GU toxicity may have important clinical implications. GU symptoms can impact patients’ quality of life during radiotherapy and may affect overall treatment tolerance. Although our study did not directly assess these outcomes, the potential impact of PM2.5-related toxicity on both quality of life and adherence indicates the need for further investigation in future prospective studies.

Our survival analysis did not reveal any significant differences in LRC, DM, DFS, or OS based on PM2.5 levels. While this may suggest a limited effect of high PM2.5 exposure during radiotherapy on long-term oncologic outcomes in this population, these findings should be interpreted with caution. The relatively small number of events for LRC, along with wide confidence intervals, may have reduced the statistical power to detect meaningful differences. Moreover, many studies demonstrating a deterministic effect of PM2.5 on survival outcomes have evaluated long-term exposure based on residential address data8,18, whereas our analysis was restricted to the treatment period at the hospital. This difference in exposure duration and context may have attenuated the observed impact on survival outcomes. Nonetheless, given that PM2.5 is a well-established risk factor for mortality in other cancers such as lung, liver, and breast35–43, further studies are warranted to clarify its role in cervical cancer outcomes.

This study’s strengths include its focus on a large, hospital-based cohort in a region with recurrent biomass burning and forest fires, which are known to elevate PM2.5 levels. Moreover, we used the latest global reanalysis dataset of atmospheric composition from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)23, which has been widely applied in healthcare research44–46. These approaches provided robust estimates of PM2.5 exposure during the radiotherapy treatment period.

However, our study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective analysis, our study is subject to potential selection bias and limited granularity in clinical data, including the absence of quality-of-life measures and unmeasured confounders such as socioeconomic status. Second, our PM2.5 exposure estimates were derived from fixed monitoring station data, which may not precisely capture individual-level exposure during treatment. Although most patients temporarily resided near the hospital during radiotherapy, likely minimizing geographic variation in exposure, we acknowledge that different exposure from variations in exposure prior to hospital stay is still possible. Third, we categorized acute radiation toxicities using a binary grouping (grade 0 vs. grade1) due to the limited number of grade2 events. Since grade 2 or higher toxicities are generally considered clinically significant, this approach may have reduced our ability to detect meaningful differences across severity levels. Fourth, the very low prevalence of self-reported smoking and alcohol use in our cohort restricted our ability to explore potential interactions between these lifestyle factors and PM2.5 exposure. Lastly, the alcohol use rate in our cohort appears lower than population-based estimates47. This discrepancy may be due to underreporting, incomplete documentation in medical records, or differences in patient characteristics, and should be interpreted with caution.

Our study demonstrates that mean daily PM2.5 exposure above 25is associated with an increased risk of acute genitourinary toxicity during radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients, although its impact on long-term survival outcomes remains unclear. Future prospective studies incorporating individual-level exposure monitoring, objective biomarkers, quality-of-life assessments, and relevant confounding factors are warranted to further delineate the role of PM2.5 in modulating treatment-related toxicity and survival in cervical cancer.
