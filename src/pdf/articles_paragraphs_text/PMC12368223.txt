Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal neoplasm originating from hematopoietic stem cells which is characterized by t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) fusion gene leading to forming an oncoprotein. miR-411 and SPRY4 may influence CML leukemogenesis by regulating proliferation, differentiation, and various signaling pathways induced by the oncoprotein. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 90 blood samples were collected from individuals diagnosed with CML, covering three distinct clinical phases: 38 samples at the diagnosis, 38 samples one year after treatment with imatinib, and 14 samples during the blastic phase. The expression levels of miR-411 and SPRY4 genes were measured using real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was conducted using nonparametric tests. Using the Mann–Whitney U test, miR-411 expression was significantly upregulated post-treatment compared to the time of diagnosis (fold change: 15.6;P< 0.0001), and downregulated in the blastic phase compared to the post-treatment phase (fold change: 1.84;P= 0.01). In contrast, SPRY4 expression was significantly downregulated post-treatment compared to the time of diagnosis (fold change: 4.5;P= 0.03), and upregulated in the blastic phase compared to the post-treatment phase (fold change: 7.8;P= 0.001). This study suggests that SPRY4 and miR-411 may exert phase-specific roles in CML progression probably with reverse pattern, although further studies are needed to clarify the role of these two genes in hematological malignancies such as CML.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents a clonal malignancy arising from hematopoietic stem cells, constituting roughly 15% of newly identified cases of leukemia in the adult population1. The prevalence of CML exhibits variability contingent upon factors such as age, sex, and geographic location2. The yearly prevalence of CML fluctuates between 0.4 per 100,000 individuals and 1.75 per 100,000 individuals across various nations3–5. The occurrence of CML exhibits an upward trend with advancing age and is infrequently observed in pediatric populations under the age of 14 years2. In CML, a common cytogenetic abnormality is characterized by a reciprocal translocation involving the ABL1 gene located on the long arm of chromosome 9 and the BCR gene situated on the long arm of chromosome 22 (t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)), leading to the elongation of the long arm of chromosome 9 (+ 9q) and the reduction of the long arm on chromosome 22 (-22q). This altered and shorter chromosome 22 is called the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and is found in 95% of CML patients6–9. This reciprocal chromosomal translocation results in the formation of an extraneous gene designated BCR::ABL1, which subsequently facilitates the synthesis of an additional BCR::ABL1 oncoprotein6,10. This oncoprotein, through the activation of numerous signaling cascades including RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, JAK/STAT, Wnt/β-catenin, MYC, and JUN kinase, facilitates the enhancement of cellular proliferation and diminishes apoptosis, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of leukemia11–15. In 1998, sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 4 (SPRY4) was initially identified as an antagonist of the fibroblast growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor signaling pathways in Drosophila16,17. In humans, four distinct subtypes (SPRY 1–4) have been characterized, which have been demonstrated to function as negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK/ERK signaling cascade18,19. In humans, SPRY4, possessing an approximate molecular mass of 32.541 kDa, is situated on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31.3) and encodes a protein comprised of 322 amino acids that belong to the cysteine-proline-rich protein family18,20. This protein features a cysteine-rich C-terminal domain (CRD), three SH3 binding motifs, and a PEST sequence, along with residues of tyrosine and serine19,21. Regarding the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade, the phosphorylated form of SPRY4 mediates the attenuation of RAS activation by obstructing the transition of RAS GDP to RAS GTP, while the non-phosphorylated variant of SPRY4 contributes to the inhibition of RAF1 activity22. On the other hand, one of the pathways activated by BCR-ABL1 is the RAS/MAPK kinase pathway, which is inhibited by SPRY4, so this is where these two pathways may interact together. Moreover, the ERK pathway serves as the principal route through which SPRY4 expression is upregulated21. Studies conducted on solid tumors reported that SPRY4 can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. Additionally, its role in hematological malignancies such as AML has been investigated, revealing that the expression of SPRY4 varies during the complete remission and at the diagnosis phase. SPRY4 plays a pivotal role in various cellular biological processes both under normal physiological conditions and in pathological circumstances20. Beyond its involvement in embryonic development and organogenesis20,23, SPRY4 is implicated in apoptosis, cellular proliferation, responses to oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, ischemic injury, and tumorigenesis24–29. Ergo, as this gene’s expression was altered in hematological malignancies such as AML, we propose that it might exhibit increased or decreased expression in other hematological malignancies such as CML, which could be due to the aforementioned signaling pathways (such as ERK, etc.).

In the entirety of the human genome, genes that code for proteins constitute less than 2%, whereas non-coding RNAs represent over 98%30,31. MicroRNA (miRNA) is classified as a single-stranded non-coding RNA, typically ranging from 18 to 25 nucleotides in length, which is ubiquitously found in eukaryotic organisms, with its primary role being the regulation of mRNA expression, thereby influencing the initiation and progression of oncogenesis30,32. Although miRNAs encompass only 1–3% of the total gene repertoire, they exert regulatory control over more than 30% of gene expression in the human population33. The miR-411 gene is situated on chromosome 14, and its precursor miRNA can undergo processing by the Dicer enzyme to yield two distinct mature miRNAs, namely miR-411-3p and miR-411-5p. Notably, miR-411-3p exhibits low levels of expression and is prone to degradation34. Thus, miR-411 demonstrates aberrant expression patterns across various cancer types. The dysregulation of miR-411 can significantly impact numerous cancer-related cellular processes, including proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and colony formation33. By targeting a variety of genes, miR-411 contributes to the activation of several significant signaling cascades, including MAPK, P53, Ras, NF-kB, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. On the other hand, BCR-ABL has the potential to influence GRB2, a component of the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade, as well as the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Consequently, given that miR-411 possesses the capability to modulate the aforementioned pathways that are also impacted by BCR-ABL, it may interact with this gene fusion in an indirect manner35–38. The expression profile of miR-411 varies across different malignancies; in certain cancers, its expression diminishes, whereas, in others, it is augmented, thereby enabling it to function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor33. Overall, only two studies have examined the association between SPRY4 and miR-411 genes in solid tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma and lung cancer, but not in hematological malignancies32,39. Therefore, they formed the basis of our study design.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent a class of pharmacological agents employed in the management of various malignancies, particularly those characterized by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the KIT gene. Nonetheless, the emergence of resistance to these therapeutic agents poses a significant obstacle within clinical treatment paradigms. A few studies reported that the SPRY4 and miR-411 genes may be contributors to the mechanisms underlying this resistance. A study revealed that SPRY4 gene has the capacity to increase sensitivity to TKIs by attenuating the activity of EGFR and MAPK signaling pathways; however, its downregulation in the context of TKIs such as osimertinib may facilitate resistance development. On the other hand, by modulating SPRY4 expression, miR-411 can indirectly contribute to resistance, as the silencing of SPRY4 promotes the activation of pathways that are implicated in resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, a modified variant of miR-411, specifically the A-to-I edited form of miR-411-5p, has the potential to enhance the response to TKIs, a hypothesis that warrants further empirical exploration. Therefore, when examining the effect of these genes in CML, it is better to also consider the possible effect of these genes on TKI resistance32,40,41.

Considering the numerous investigations conducted on SPRY4 and miR-411 genes in solid tumors and the lack of studies in blood malignancies such as CML, the effect of these two genes on at least one of the important signaling pathways in CML, and also the different behavior of this gene in different cancers (being an oncogene or tumor suppressor), this study aimed to assess the expressions of these two genes in patients with CML.

In this cross-sectional study, which was undertaken from May 23, 2023, to May 23, 2024, a total of 90 blood specimens were procured from patients diagnosed with CML within Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran. This study was conducted under the regulations of the Medical Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences (approval No. IR.IUMS.REC.1402.196), and all methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The samples were collected from patients across three distinct phases: at the point of diagnosis (comprising 38 patients, including 22 males and 16 females); one year after treatment with imatinib (consisting of 38 patients, incorporating 22 males and 16 females); and during the blastic phase (involving 14 patients, with 11 males and 3 females). The "at the time of diagnosis" group served as the reference group, against which the patients in the subsequent two groups were evaluated. The inclusion criteria encompassed patients who received a diagnosis of CML confirmed by an oncologist’s assessment and supported by molecular or cytogenetic testing. It should be noted that all CML patients who entered the study had the P210 isoform, and all patients in the treatment group received the same tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) i.e., imatinib. The exclusion criteria comprised instances of patient non-cooperation regarding sampling, the incompleteness of laboratory data pertaining to the patients, and the presence of other underlying medical conditions aside from CML. Laboratory parameters, including hemoglobin levels, platelet and white blood cell counts, molecular evaluation of the BCR::ABL1 fusion, and determination of the BCR::ABL1:ABL1% ratio, in order to determine the Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) after treatment, were assessed. Detailed information on the patients’ data was presented in Table1.

Due to the presence of the BCR::ABL1 fusion in all leukocytes, a buffy coat was employed for the isolation of RNA. Whole blood samples obtained from patients diagnosed with CML were subjected to centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min. The Buffy coat, which constitutes the intermediary layer between the plasma and erythrocytes, was subsequently isolated. Trizol reagent was added to the Buffy coat and allowed to incubate for 15 min. Ultimately, RNA was extracted utilizing chloroform, isopropanol, and ethanol (75%) solutions. The quantity of the isolated RNA was determined by assessing the A260/A280 nm and A260/A230 nm ratios via a NanoDrop UV–visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Additionally, in order to assess the quality of the extracted RNA to prevent erroneous results in qPCR, such as when the RNAs undergo degradation, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by conventional PCR was conducted. After RNA extraction, DNase treatment (Thermofisher, Germany) was administered using DNase I, buffer, and EDTA solutions to mitigate the interfering effects of DNA. Thereafter, 1 µg of the treated RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) following the protocol outlined in the cDNA synthesis kit (Yekta Tajhiz Azma, Iran). For cDNA synthesis of SPRY4 and β-actin genes, 0.5 µL Oligo dT primer, 0.5 µL Random hexamer primer, 5.75 µL from the DNase treatment step, 0.5 µL dNTP, 2 µL Buffer, 0.25 µL RNase inhibitor, and 0.5 µL RT enzyme (total volume = 10 µL) were mixed together, and the process was carried out according to the temperature profile: (1) Primer Annealing: 15 min at 37°C; (2) Amplification: 60 min at 42°C; (3) Inactivation: 5 min at 70°C; (4) Final Step: 10 min at 4°C for temporary storage and to maintain product stability. However, cDNA synthesis of miR-411 and U6 was carried out according to the temperature profile: (1) 30 min at 16°C; (2) 30 min at 42°C; (3) 5 min at 70°C. It is imperative to note that for the cDNA synthesis of miR-411 and U6 at this juncture, the stem-loop for each respective gene was incorporated (the sequences of the stem-loop primers are delineated in Table2), whereas oligo dT and Random Hexamer were utilized for the SPRY4 and actin genes.

Semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted utilizing a Roche light cycler (Germany). For the real-time amplification process, two distinct series of reactions were undertaken: 1. for SPRY4 and Actin genes, and 2. for miR-411 and U6 genes. In accordance with the protocols provided by the manufacturer, a final reaction volume of 15 μl was employed for each assay, which encompassed 7.5 µl of Master-Mix 2 × SYBR green without ROX (Ampliqon, Denmark), 1.5 µl (for miR-411 and U6) and 1 µl (for SPRY4 and Actin) of both forward and reverse primers, alongside 5 µl (for miR-411 and U6) and 5.5 µl (for SPRY4 and Actin) of distilled water (DW). The RT-PCR reaction incorporated a preincubation phase at 95°C for 15 min, followed by a two-step amplification process (40 cycles) comprised of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 60 s (annealing/extension). Each specimen was subjected to analysis in duplicate, and melting curve analysis was employed to ascertain the specificity of the PCR products. Efficiency testing was performed for all four primers, and since the R2index was above 0.99, the Livak method was utilized to compute the fold change expression of the SPRY4 gene relative to Actin (the housekeeping gene) and miR-411 in relation to U6 (the housekeeping gene). The primer sequences utilized in the real-time PCR reaction are presented in Table3.

The statistical analysis of data was conducted utilizing SPSS version 27.0 and Prism version 10.4.0 software. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov or the Shapiro–Wilk test was employed to assess the normality of the data distribution. The independent samples t-test and the Mann–Whitney U test (if the data distribution was not normal) were applied to compare the means between the two groups. Correlation analyses were performed using either Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficient, contingent upon the results of the normality assessment, to examine the relationship between two quantitative variables. A statistically significant difference was defined asP< 0.05.

A complete blood count (CBC) was conducted for each patient during every distinct phase of the disease. In the chronic, post-treatment, and blastic phases, the average white blood cell count was 119,921 ± 83,066, 9,081 ± 6,992, and 81,237 ± 62,827, respectively; the average hemoglobin levels were recorded as 11.4 ± 2.5, 13.9 ± 2.1, and 8.9 ± 1.6, respectively; and the average platelet count was 650,605 ± 124,668, 213,868 ± 91,987, and 64,335 ± 46,857, respectively. Given that the patients in this investigation were paired samples "at the time of diagnosis" and "one year after treatment," the mean age of patients at diagnosis was determined to be 47.4 ± 13, while the mean age one year after treatment was 48.4 ± 13. Nevertheless, the mean age of patients within the blastic group was assessed at 42.5 ± 14.3. All numerical values stated above were reported as mean ± SD (standard deviation). Some of the data in CBC were not normally distributed and had skewness, as reported in Table1. The minimal residual disease (MRD) levels of patients were evaluated one year after treatment with imatinib. MRD was classified into 6 subgroups: (1) complete hematological remission (CHR): BCR-ABL at a level of < 10%; (2) complete cytogenetic response (CCyR): BCR-ABL at a level of < 1%; (3) major molecular response (MMR-MR3): BCR-ABL at a level of < 0.1%; (4) MR4: BCR-ABL at a level of < 0.01%; (5) MR4.5: BCR-ABL at a level of < 0.0032%; (6) MR5: BCR-ABL at a level of < 0.001%. Based on the above classification, 4 patients had CHR (10.5%), 10 patients achieved CCyR (26.3%), 14 patients reached MR3 (36.8%), 2 patients accomplished MR4 (5.3%), 1 patient reached MR4.5 (2.6%), and 1 patient achieved MR5 (2.6%), whereas 6 patients exhibited no response to the treatment (15.8%). Among the 14 patients who progressed into the blastic phase, 7 patients (50%) developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 7 patients (50%) developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

As depicted in Fig.1, miR-411 expression demonstrated a significant upregulation in patients one year after treatment when contrasted with individuals at the time of diagnosis (fold change: 15.6;P< 0.0001). The expression level of the miR-411 gene exhibited a significant upregulation during the blastic phase in comparison to the "at the time of diagnosis" phase (fold change: 8.5;P= 0.01). Moreover, the mentioned gene expression was significantly downregulated in patients experiencing the blastic phase relative to those who received treatment (fold change: 1.84;P= 0.01).

Regarding the expression of SPRY4, it was observed that SPRY4 expression was significantly downregulated in patients one year after treatment, in contrast to individuals at the time of diagnosis (fold change: 4.5;P= 0.03). The expression level of the SPRY4 gene was significantly upregulated during the blastic phase when compared to the "at the time of diagnosis" phase (fold change: 1.7;P= 0.03) (Fig.2). In addition, the expression of the mentioned gene was significantly upregulated in patients during the blastic phase in comparison to patients who underwent treatment (fold change: 7.8;P= 0.001).

As shown in Table4, a significant association was found between the mean expression level of the SPRY4 gene during the treatment phase and the specific type of blastic phase (transformation into AML or ALL) (P= 0.02). However, concerning miR-411, a significant correlation was noted between the mean expression of this gene at the time of diagnosis and the type of blastic phase (transformation into AML or ALL) (P= 0.03). No significant correlation was identified between the mean expression levels of the SPRY4 and miR-411 genes in the post-treatment phase and the type of MRD following treatment (P> 0.05).

Correlation analysis between miR-411 and SPRY4 gene expression and laboratory findings.

There existed a weak negative correlation between the average expression levels of the SPRY4 and miR-411 genes at the time of diagnosis phase; however, this correlation did not reach statistical significance (r = − 0.1,P> 0.05). A statistically significant correlation was observed between the average expression of the SPRY4 gene during the post-treatment phase and the mean WBC count after treatment (r = 0.58,P= 0.001). Conversely, no statistically significant correlation was identified between the average miR-411 expression across all three phases and the mean WBC count (P> 0.05). As well, a significant correlation was noted between the average expression of the miR-411 gene during the treatment phase and the mean hemoglobin (Hb) value during the post-treatment phase (r = 0.39,p= 0.02). Nonetheless, there was an absence of a statistically significant correlation between the average expression of the SPRY4 gene across all three phases and the mean Hb count (P> 0.05). Into the bargain, a significant correlation was found between miR-411 expression at the time of diagnosis and the mean platelet count at the same time point (r = − 0.4,p= 0.02). Nevertheless, there was no significant correlation between the average expression of SPRY4 across all three phases and the mean platelet count (P> 0.05). Moreover, a correlation analysis was conducted between the average age in all phases and the level of gene expression in each phase, and no significant correlation was observed (P> 0.05).

miR-411 exhibits differential expression profiles across various malignancies, with certain cancers demonstrating diminished expression levels while others reveal elevated expression, thereby functioning as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor33. Based on our research, the expression of the miR-411 gene was significantly upregulated in patients who underwent treatment for one year, in comparison to individuals at the time of diagnosis (fold change: 15.6). As the disease progressed to a more aggressive state and transitioned into the blastic phase, the expression of the mentioned gene was downregulated compared to patients who underwent treatment (fold change: 1.84). Hence, this molecule probably fulfills a specific role in CML. The BCR::ABL1 protein possesses the capability to activate critical signaling cascades, among which is the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. The activation of this pathway results, on one hand, in enhanced cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion, while simultaneously, on the other hand, it diminishes the process of apoptosis42. Another significant signaling pathway activated by the BCR::ABL1 protein is the Ras/MAPK pathway43. GRB2 is an integral component of the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade, and by activating SOS, it precipitates the activation of Ras, Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, which ultimately promotes cellular growth and differentiation44. Zhang et al. reported that miR-411 inhibits GRB2 expression in breast cancer. Ergo, by diminishing miR-411 expression, its inhibitory impact on this signaling pathway is negated, resulting in the unrestrained activation of this pathway. Another significant finding derived from this study indicated that patients exhibiting elevated expression levels of miR-411 and, consequently, reduced levels of GRB2, experienced a prolonged overall survival in comparison to their counterparts38. Besides, the BCR::ABL1 protein can also instigate the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The activation of this signaling pathway results in enhanced cellular proliferation, migratory capacity, invasive potential, and diminished apoptotic activity. Liu et al. demonstrated that elevated levels of miR-411 contribute to the suppression of β-catenin activity in colorectal carcinoma35. Accumulating studies collectively underscore the tumor-suppressive properties of miR-411, aligning with the findings of our research. In our study, the tumor suppressive role of miR-411 could be due to the recruitment of one of the mediators involved in the previously mentioned signaling pathways (GRB2, β-catenin, etc.). One of the limitations of our investigation was the absence of assays such as luciferase assays and Western blots, which would have corroborated the involvement of these two genes in CML. Consequently, attributing the results of our research to variables such as GRB2, β-catenin, or Akt remains a theoretical proposition, and these findings may be contingent upon elements beyond these factors. Hence, subsequent research endeavors may elucidate the precise function of these two genes in CML through conducting the aforementioned assays. In contrast, several studies demonstrated an oncogenic role of miR-411. In Xia et al.'s research, the expression levels of miR-411 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor tissues and some HCC cell lines exhibited a significant increase compared to normal liver cell lines and adjacent tissue45. In another study, the expression of miR-411 in malignant tissues from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cell lines was notably increased relative to normal bronchial epithelial cell lines46. The other inquiry reported that the expression level of miR-411 was higher in either the tissues or serum, as well as osteosarcoma cell lines, compared to those observed in healthy tissue, serum, and cell lines47. The discrepancies in miR-411 expression across the three previously mentioned malignancies may stem from some factors: 1. The limited sample sizes in each investigation, with the majority comprising approximately 30 pairs; 2. The heterogeneous clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients, which could contribute to variable expression levels of miR-411; 3. The utilization of distinct cell lines across different studies may result in a lack of comparability among findings. As a result, the observed contradictory results underscore the necessity for more expansive research endeavors to elucidate the mechanistic role of miR-411 across various cancers, particularly in hematological malignancies, given the insufficient number of studies addressing these specific malignancies, such as CML.

SPRY4 is crucial in the modulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway and governs essential facets of organogenesis, developmental processes, and the onset of malignant tumors48. The significance of SPRY proteins across various cellular lineages is influenced by diverse tumor milieus. Therefore, akin to miR-411, which exhibits differential expression across various malignancies, SPRY4 similarly possesses the characteristic of variable expression; its expression is diminished in certain cancers, while in others it is augmented. Although SPRY4 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor in the majority of cells, it may also exhibit oncogenic properties in a limited number of malignancies19. The function of SPRY4 has predominantly been explored in solid tumors. In research on perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC), the expression of SPRY4 in PHCC tumor tissues was markedly diminished compared to that in neighboring tumor-associated tissues. An additional finding from this study indicated that SPRY4 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by suppressing ERK phosphorylation. Hence, a tumor-suppressive function of SPRY4 was revealed in PHCC49. In another study implemented by Xiaoling et al. on human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, SPRY4 expression was downregulated in CRC tumor tissues and significantly associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, thereby implying that SPRY4 may serve as a tumor suppressor during the progression of human CRC50. In addition to pursuing the role of SPRY4 in solid tumors, SPRY4 was also engaged in hematological malignancies such as AML. Olivia et al. undertook an exploration on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), measuring the copy number of the SPRY4 gene in samples collected at two distinct times in MDS: at the point of diagnosis (MDS-Dg) and during complete cytogenetic remission subsequent to azacytidine treatment (MDS-CR). Moreover, in AML, assessments were made at three specific time intervals: at the moment of diagnosis (AML-Dg), during complete cytogenetic remission (AML-CR), and upon relapse. It has been documented that during the complete remission phases in patients with AML and MDS, the expression levels of SPRY4 exhibited an increase when compared to the initial diagnostic stage; conversely, a decline in expression was noted at the time of relapse in AML patients51. In contrast to previous findings, our research indicated that SPRY4 gene expression was downregulated in patients who underwent treatment for one year, in comparison to individuals at the time of diagnosis (fold change: 4.5). As the disease progressed to the blastic phase, the expression of this gene was observed to be upregulated compared to patients who underwent treatment (fold change: 7.8). Ergo, our study elucidated that this gene may serve a potential role in CML. Das et al. reported that the levels of SPRY4, both mRNA and protein, were significantly elevated in human testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) cell lines (the 833K and NT2-D1 cell lines), compared to those observed in normal adult testicular tissue. They articulated that this phenomenon was attributable to the substantial decrease in Akt phosphorylation induced by SPRY4 suppression, thereby impeding tumorigenesis52. The other inquiry, executed by Pan et al. on gastric cancer (GC) tumor tissue and non-tumor GC tissue specimens, highlighted that the expression of SPRY4 was markedly elevated in tumor tissues in comparison to non-tumor tissues. Furthermore, they demonstrated that diminished SPRY4 expression resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation and migratory capacity of GC cells. Their achievement depicted that the interaction of H3K4me2 with the oncogenic SPRY4 promoter region facilitated an increase in SPRY4 expression, thereby amplifying its oncogenic potential53. The findings from two previous studies exhibited the specific function of SPRY4, aligning with the results of our research. The observed discrepancies in SPRY4 expression may be attributed to some determinants: (1) cancer type specificity (e.g., the oncogenic function of SPRY4 in certain cell lines such as 833K and NT2-D1 cell lines, but a tumor-suppressive role in other cell lines); (2) molecular pathway, such as the involvement of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which could modulate functionality (for example, the phosphorylation of Akt by SPRY4 in TGCT); (3) epigenetic regulation (for instance, the oncogenic role of SPRY4 owing to the role of H3K4me2 in gastric carcinoma). Since in our study, we assessed the expression levels of the SPRY4 gene rather than the associated signaling pathways, elucidation of the precise mechanisms through which SPRY4 operates in CML necessitates further exploration. Nonetheless, in light of the two recent researches, the specific role of SPRY4 may be due to the variations in the phosphorylation status of Akt or the binding affinity of H3K4me2 to the SPRY4 promoter.

It should be highlighted that the necessity for a more extensive investigation to ascertain whether the variables delineated in this manuscript (sample size, heterogeneous clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients, cancer type specificity, epigenetic regulation, and molecular pathway) are responsible for the observed discrepancies in the expression of the SPRY4 and miR-411 genes is paramount, as this would enable the examination of the influence of each factor and ultimately yield a conclusive determination. In the present study, owing to limitations in performing additional experiments, we hypothesize that these factors constitute significant contributors to the observed discrepancies in the expression profiles of these genes.

Considering the distinct expression patterns of miR-411 and SPRY4 across different phases of CML, future studies should focus on exploring their functional impact using experimental models. For instance, CML cell lines such as K562 or LAMA84 could be employed to perform gene modulation assays—either through overexpression or knockdown approaches (e.g., siRNA, miRNA mimics/inhibitors). Additionally, techniques such as luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis could be utilized to investigate downstream effects on signaling pathways potentially involving GRB2, β-catenin, or Akt. These approaches may help clarify the mechanistic roles of miR-411 and SPRY4 in CML pathogenesis.

To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to measure the expression levels of two genes, SPRY4 and miR-411, in different phases of patients with CML, so it was not possible to compare with previous CML findings. However, our research was subjected to some limitations: 1. The number of included patients was relatively small, particularly the subset of patients in the blast crisis phase, which is due to the low probability of patients entering this phase; 2. Molecular subtype data (e.g., IKZF1) were not available; 3. Some patients exhibited reluctance to cooperate in providing biological sample; 4. Insufficient funding hampered our ability to conduct additional assessment aimed at delineating the precise functionalities of SPRY4 and miR-411 molecules; 5. Not conducting luciferase assay or Western blot for corroborating the involvement of SPRY4 and miR-411 genes in CML; 6. All patients in post-treatment phase were treated with imatinib; 7. Just 2,1, and 1 patients achieved MR4, MR4.5, and MR5 respectively, which are the optimal response after one year of treatment with TKIs.

This investigation elucidates a phase-specific duality in the expression of SPRY4 and miR-411 in CML. Nevertheless, SPRY4 exhibits a downregulation subsequent to treatment yet an upregulation during blast crisis, indicating contextually dependent oncogenic functions, which may be potentially mediated by RAS/ERK feedback mechanisms or through epigenetic alterations (e.g., H3K4me2 promoter interaction). Conversely, miR-411 demonstrates an opposing trend, which correlates with tumor-suppressive activities, probably via the inhibition of GRB2 or the suppression of β-catenin, although its lineage-specific duality (oncogenic in solid tumors) necessitates careful consideration. In the end, on one hand, the expression patterns and roles of these two genes may vary across different malignancies, and on the other hand, the limited sample size in our study, as well as in most existing studies, underscores the issue that more extensive research with larger sample sizes should be conducted to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which these two molecules operate in various cancers, particularly in hematological malignancies such as CML.
