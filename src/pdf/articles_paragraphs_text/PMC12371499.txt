Challenges in pancreatic
cancer treatment primarily arise
from
chemotherapy resistance, cancer cell metastasis, and frequent late-stage
diagnoses. These issues significantly compromise the effectiveness
of standard treatments and highlight the urgent need for targeted
approaches. In this context, we explored the anticancer potential
of bis-quaternary ammonium-based compounds (BQACs), which remains
largely uncharted. This study examines the structure–activity
relationship of amphiphilic bicationic compounds as anticancer agents,
focusing on their selectivity against pancreatic cancer cells. Our
analysis revealed a potent antiproliferative effect associated with
mitochondrial accumulation and subsequent mitochondrial membrane depolarization.
Furthermore, combination therapies involving BQACs and chemotherapeutic
drugs were explored to enhance treatment efficacy. Consequently, we
propose a novel combination of BQACs with metformin, resulting in
enhanced cellular uptake of the latter. The synergistic effect of
the combination enables a significantly lower effective dose of metformin
when used alongside BQACs to achieve therapeutic outcomes.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most challenging
forms of cancer,
characterized by its late diagnosis, aggressive progression, and resistance
to current treatment options. Despite representing only 3% of all
cancers, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality,
with a five-year survival rate of just 12%.,This
low prognosis stems from several factors. First, pancreatic cancer
is frequently detected at advanced stages due to its clinically silent
nature and lack of early detection methods. Nearly half of patients
present with metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis, excluding
them from potentially curative surgical resection. Second, the tumor’s dense stromal structure and
poor vascularization hinder drug delivery, reducing the effectiveness
of conventional chemotherapy. Moreover,
the rapid development of drug resistance further limits the efficacy
of standard treatments, underscoring the need for innovative therapeutic
approaches.

Targeting mitochondrial function represents a promising
strategy
in pancreatic cancer therapy due to the organelle’s critical
role in tumor cell metabolism and survival. It was reported that pancreatic
cancer cells are especially dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) for energy production, and that mitochondrial metabolism
represents a key metabolic vulnerability.−Disrupting OXPHOS
can impair energy production, reduce cancer cell viability, and sensitize
tumors to treatment. Furthermore, mitochondria play a central role
in regulating apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c, which
activates caspase-dependent cell death pathways. By inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, therapeutic agents
can trigger intrinsic apoptosis via mitophagy, thereby enhancing cancer
cell death. Exploiting mitochondrial vulnerabilities
offers a strategy to overcome the inherent resistance of pancreatic
tumors to conventional therapies.

Given the multifaceted resistance
mechanisms of pancreatic cancer,
combination therapy has emerged as an attractive approach to improve
treatment efficacy. Combination strategies enable dose optimization,
potentially reducing side effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.
Additionally, combining drugs with complementary mechanisms of action
can enhance cytotoxicity, reduce the likelihood of resistance, and
target multiple cancer cell populations simultaneously. For instance,
combining a conventional anticancer drug such as doxorubicin, which
primarily targets nuclear DNA, with a mitochondria-targeting agent
offers to address different aspects of cellular metabolism and survival
pathways, potentially leading to improved therapeutic outcomes. Another
compelling strategy is the combination of drugs that share the same
target to exhibit synergistic effects. For example, pairing metformin,
a metabolic modulator that disrupts mitochondrial function, with another
mitochondria-targeting agent. Metformin has attracted significant
attention for its ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, reduce
OXPHOS, and induce metabolic stress in cancer cells. However, clinical trials involving metformin as an anticancer
drug have encountered challenges, primarily due to its low bioavailability.

In this study, we started by exploring
the pancreatic anticancer
activity of new cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), known to exert
their effects through membrane disruption, lysosomal accumulation,
and mitochondrial targeting. Their cationic nature allows them to
bind negatively charged cancer cell membranes, while their hydrophobic
regions insert into lipid bilayers, leading to membrane permeabilization. These types of drugs are also known to effectively
target mitochondria, which have higher negative membrane charges. Mitochondrial uptake causes oxidative stress
and cytochrome c release, inducing apoptosis at lower doses and necrosis
at higher doses, making them valuable candidates for cancer therapies.
By interfering with lipid metabolism and bypassing drug resistance
mechanisms, these compounds can enhance chemotherapy efficacy and
offer promising strategies for cancer treatment. Herein, we introduce
innovative biquaternary ammonium compounds (BQACs) as a strategy to
overcome pancreatic cancer cells resistance. We investigated the structure–activity
relationship of benzimidazolium and quinolinium derivatives. Benzimidazolium
and quinolinium are valuable structural motifs for cationic drugs
due to their unique structural and electronic properties. These advantages
stem from their cationic nature, aromatic systems, stability and tunable
functional groups, enabling precise mitochondrial targeting and enhanced
membrane interaction. The benzimidazolium motif facilitates π-π
stacking and hydrogen bonding with mitochondrial targets, enhancing
mitochondrial accumulation and membrane disruption, minimizing off-target
effects thus improving therapeutic precision.,Quinolinium analogues, characterized by their delocalized positive
charge, exhibit excellent membrane permeability and exploit the mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm ≈ −180 mV) to drive
selective mitochondrial accumulation. This property is particularly advantageous in cancer cells, which
often display higher ΔΨm than normal cells, allowing for
enhanced selective targeting. Some quinolinium derivatives are known
to bind mitochondrial RNA, inducing dysfunction through apoptosis
and OXPHOS inhibition. Both motifs share
a multifunctional scaffold with modifiable alkyl groups, and a planar
aromatic system which facilitates insertion into lipid bilayers, destabilizing
membranes and promoting permeabilization. Hence their cationic amphiphilicity,
and structural adaptability, allows for drug development and optimization.
To elucidate the underlying anticancer mechanisms of benzimidazolium
and quinolinium based BQACs, we conducted a thorough investigation
into their membrane-permeabilizing activity and mitochondrial-targeting
effects. Additionally, we explored the combination of BQACs with two
different chemotherapeutic drugs – doxorubicin and metforminto
propose novel combination therapies approach.

Building on our recent success
designing potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, we turned our
attention to the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. Our
prior work involved the development of a series of bis-benzimidazolium
salts, characterized by their tunable degree of hydrophobicity and
rigidity. These salts exhibited potent
activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria by disrupting bacterial
cell membranes and showed remarkable resilience to resistance development.
Given the success of bis-benzimidazolium salts as antimicrobial agents,
primarily due to their cationic amphiphilic nature facilitating selective
interaction and disruption of negatively charged membranes, we hypothesized
that these properties might be advantageous to target negatively charged
components of cancer cell membranes and mitochondria. This approach
aims to elicit an anticancer response in pancreatic cancer cells,
notorious for their resistant nature and challenging treatment.

To explore this hypothesis, we repurposed our first-generation bis-ammonium
compounds (Figure). Our primary objective was to establish a ground understanding
of the structure–activity relationship (SAR) that governs the
anticancer activity of these bis-cationic-amphiphilic small molecules
against pancreatic cancer cells (Table). Preliminary results revealed that the most hydrophilic
analoguescharacterized by a short hexyl side chain and hydrophilic
ether, diamide or short alkyl linkersexhibited the highest
selectivity. These compounds demonstrated significant antiproliferative
effects against pancreatic cancer cells while maintaining minimal
cytotoxicity toward normal cells (Table).

compounds.

IC50values are the
mean of three independent triplicates.

S.I. Selectivity index = IC50value of normal
cell line over IC50value of

Additionally, we synthesized
a series of compounds
featuring a
photoactive diamide-stilbene linker (Series 8), to enable fluorescence
imaging, which can provide valuable insights into the localization
and dynamics of these compounds within cellular environments (SchemeD).

In vitroviability assays were
conducted to evaluate the selectivity of series 1 to 4 toward pancreatic
cancer cells and normal cells. The compounds were tested on two pancreatic
cancer cell lines, KP4 and PANC1, which exhibit notable resistance-related
characteristics, including independence from the KRAS signaling pathway
and high expression of drug transporters such as ABCB1, ABCG2, and
ABCC1.,To evaluate the selectivity of the compounds,
we conducted a comparative analysis of their anticancer efficacy in
relation to their cytotoxic effects on two prominent models of normal
cell lines. The first model utilized was IMR90, which consists of
human lung fibroblasts, providing insights into the compounds’
effects on mesenchymal cells. The second model employed was hTERT-HPNE,
representing immortalized human pancreatic epithelial cells, which
serves as a benchmark for assessing the impact on epithelial tissues.
This dual approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the
therapeutic potential of the compounds while simultaneously gauging
their safety profile in normal cellular contexts. The selectivity
index was calculated for each compound, providing insights into the
compound’s therapeutic potential and biocompatibility. Several
candidates exhibited high selectivity indices, indicating their ability
to target diseased cells while minimizing toxicity to normal cells.

Overall, the results suggest that the designed BQACs exhibited
stronger activity against the KP4 cancer cell line compared to the
PANC1 cell line, which may be attributed to the higher expression
of resistance markers in PANC1 or the tendency of PANC1 cells to form
large aggregates inin vitroculture. The most selective
compounds were generally the more hydrophilic BQACs within each series.
Specifically, compounds4a,6a,7a, and8afrom series 1,9aand9dfrom series 2, and10a,10d,11a, and12afrom series 3 demonstrated excellent selectivity
for KP4 cells and good affinity for PANC1 cells compared to IMR90
and hTERT-HPNE cells. Although these hydrophilic compounds required
higher concentrations to achieve 50% inhibition of cancer cell growth,
they showed exponentially reduced cytotoxicity toward normal cells
(Table).

These
findings motivated the design of the second generation of
series with enhanced hydrophilic properties, incorporating guanidinium,
dimethoxybenzimidazolium, and quinolinium groups to improve membrane
permeability and interactions with biological systems. The 2-aminobenzimidazolium derivatives (series
5) showed notable cytotoxicity, but exhibited very low selectivity
(Table). In contrast,
the dimethoxybenzimidazolium-based compounds (series 6) and benzimidazolium-dimethoxyisoquinolinium-based
BQACs (series 7) demonstrated a more favorable profile. Although these
compounds showed reduced overall activity, they exhibited significantly
improved selectivity. Notably, compounds23,26, and31achieved selectivity indices exceeding 10 for
the KP4 cell line (Table). Compound31was particularly noteworthy, as
it demonstrated targeted activity against both KP4 and PANC1 cells,
with high selectivity indices for both cancerous lines compared to
both normal cell lines.

mean of three independent triplicates.

A large therapeutic
window is a significant
advantage in pharmacology, as it allows for dosage adjustments to
optimize therapeutic effects while minimizing potential toxicity.
To validate the selective antiproliferative activity of the promising
anticancer compounds, we conducted a comparative cell viability analysis
between the KP4 cancer cell line and the IMR90 normal fibroblast line.
Both cell lines were treated with concentrations exceeding the established
anticancer IC50values for each compound. Our findings
revealed that, at a dosage set at 10-fold the respective IC50for each BQAC against KP4 cells, these compounds successfully inhibited
cancer cells proliferation by over 80%, with little to no effect on
the growth of IMR90 cells (Figure). This result highlights the selective nature of these
compounds, as reflected by a selectivity index (S.I.) greater than
10in vitro(Tablesand ).

To investigate the anticancer
mechanisms of our most selective compounds, we focused on the cell
membrane as a potential target. To assess membrane integrity, we used
the membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI), which
only binds to nucleic acids when the cell membrane is significantly
compromised. KP4 cells were treated with each compound at their respective
IC50concentrations and cultured for 48 h before adding
PI. Control experiments included KP4 cells treated with DMSO and Triton
X-100. Observations made using confocal microscopy revealed that KP4
cells treated with compounds8a,9a,11a,26, and31exhibited minimal
intracellular PI fluorescence compared to the Triton positive control
(FigureA). This result
suggests that these compounds induce only slight permeabilization
of the cell membrane to PI. Therefore, our findings indicate that
the anticancer mechanisms of these specific compounds likely do not
primarily involve the permeabilization of the cell membrane.

with compounds8a,9a,11a,26, and31at their respective IC50value for 48 h prior to PI addition (red). DMSO-treated cells served
as negative control, while Triton X-100-treated cells served as positive
control. (B) Membrane potential analysis of KP4 cells treated with8a,9a,11a,26, and31at half, once and twice their respective IC50value, following the fluorescence intensity of DiSC2(5).
DMSO-treated cells served as negative control, while Triton X-100-treated
cells served as positive control. Measurements were performed in triplicate.

Given
the compounds showed
minimal anticancer effects through cell membrane lysis, we shifted
our focus to their impact on cell membrane potential. KP4 cells were
incubated with the cationic lipophilic dye DiSC2(5) and
then treated with BQACs8a,9a,11a,26, and31at concentrations corresponding
to half, once and twice their respective IC50values. We
monitored the fluorescence intensity of DiSC2(5) over a
three-hour period following treatment. DiSC2(5) accumulates
in polarized membranes, leading to self-quenching of the dye’s
fluorescence. When membrane depolarization occurs, the dye is released,
resulting in an increase in fluorescence intensity.

Compounds8a,9a,11a,26, and31exhibited a transient
effect on membrane potential, inducing a brief depolarization followed
by a plateau (FigureB). This suggests a temporary interaction with the cell membrane,
likely due to their low affinity for the lipid bilayer. We hypothesize
that these compounds briefly permeabilize the membrane, allowing ion
flux, before diffusing into either the extracellular environment or
the cytoplasm. Importantly, the observed membrane depolarization is
not sustained, indicating that the anticancer activity of these compounds
is unlikely due to irreversible membrane disruption like permanent
depolarization or lysis. While these compounds do demonstrate transient
membrane permeabilization, their primary mechanism of action likely
involves other cellular targets. This behavior is consistent with
cationic amphiphilic drugs (e.g., ACPs, TPP-functionalized molecules),
which often traverse the lipid bilayer to engage with intracellular
components and exert their anticancer effects.

To determine
the subcellular
localization and potential targets of the synthesized BQACs, we designed
fluorescent probes, compounds16aand16b(FigureA). These
probes exhibit excitation and emission spectra within the short-nanometer
range, comparable to the DNA-binding dye DAPI (FigureB, full spectrum inFigure S2). We utilized confocal microscopy with the DAPI filter to
visualize the intracellular distribution of16aand16bin KP4 cells (FigureC). Given the cationic amphiphilic nature of these
compounds and the known tendency of such molecules to localize in
mitochondria, we investigated their colocalization with the commercially
available mitochondrial probe, MitoTracker Deep Red (MTDR). Confocal
microscopy revealed a high degree of colocalization between both16aand16bwith MTDR (FigureC). Quantitative analysis confirmed this
observation, yielding Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.87 and
0.93 for16aand16b, respectively (FigureD). These findings
suggest that the bis-cationic amphiphilic structure of these compounds
allows them to readily cross the cell membrane and specifically target
mitochondria.

in mitochondrial regions.

Mitochondrial
membrane disruption, driven by the interaction of cationic moieties
with anionic phospholipids like phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin,
is a well-established mechanism of action for cationic amphiphilic
compounds. To investigate whether our
BQACs function similarly, we assessed their impact on mitochondrial
membrane potential using the fluorescent probe JC-1. JC-1 emits red-orange fluorescence when aggregated in healthy
mitochondria with high membrane potential, but shifts to green fluorescence
upon depolarization-induced monomerization. KP4 cells were treated with compounds8a,9a,11a,26, and31at their
respective IC50value for 48 h. Controls included DMSO
and FCCP, a known mitochondrial uncoupler. Microscopic analysis revealed significant green fluorescence in
BQAC-treated cells, indicating mitochondrial membrane depolarization
(Figure). In contrast,
DMSO-treated cells exhibited predominantly red-orange fluorescence,
signifying intact mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure).

Assessment of mitochondrial
membrane depolarization in KP4 cells
treated with BQACs using the JC-1 probe. Orange fluorescence indicates
healthy mitochondria, while green fluorescence signifies damaged mitochondria.

These findings strongly suggest that the anticancer
activity of
these BQACs involves disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity,
leading to depolarization. Such mitochondrial permeabilization is
a hallmark of early apoptosis, triggering cytochrome c release and
subsequent activation of the apoptotic cascade. Therefore, these results
highlight the potential of BQACs to selectively induce programmed
cell death in cancer cells.

The complex and divers resistance
mechanisms of pancreatic cancer have necessitated the exploration
of innovative treatment strategies. The implementation of combination
therapy has emerged as an attractive approach to enable dose optimization,
potentially reducing side effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy,
and overcoming drug resistance by targeting multiple metabolic pathways.

To assess the potential benefit of combination therapy in the context
of pancreatic cancer, we conductedin vitroassays
to evaluate the interactions between BQACs and two different chemotherapeutic
agents: doxorubicin (DOX) and metformin (MET) (Figure). Doxorubicin is a well-established conventional
antineoplastic drug that exerts its effects primarily by targeting
nuclear DNA. Despite its widespread use in cancer treatment, doxorubicin
is notorious for its severe side effects, which can significantly
impact a patient’s quality of life. On the other hand, metformin, a drug traditionally used for type
2 diabetes, has been repurposed in oncology due to its ability to
target complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This mechanism induces metabolic stress in cancer
cells, making them more susceptible to treatment. However, metformin’s
high hydrophilicity poses challenges for its clinical application
as an anticancer agent, primarily due to its limited membrane permeability
and consequently low bioavailability.

The rationale behind combining doxorubicin with
BQACs lies in their
ability to target different cellular components, thereby creating
a complementary therapeutic effect. The combination of doxorubicin
and BQACs was tested at a molar ratio of 1:40, with doxorubicin concentrations
ranging from 0.00078 to 0.2 μM and BQACs from 0.031 to 8.0 μM,
based on their respective IC50values. The results indicated
that there was no synergistic effect between doxorubicin and the tested
BQACs at this ratio against KP4 pancreatic cancer cells (Figure). The combination
indexes close to 1 suggest an additive interaction and the possibility
to use these drugs in combination to target multiple cellular pathways
and overcome resistance mechanism, with no antagonist effect (Table).

against KP4 cells in combination with BQACs

(ANOVA).

On the other hand, combining two
mitochondria-targeting
agents,
such as metformin and BQACs, aims at improving therapeutic efficacy
at lower concentrations. The combination of metformin and BQACs was
examined at a molar ratio of 50:1, with metformin concentrations spanning
from 1.56 to 400 μM and BQACs from 0.031 to 8.0 μM. The
results demonstrated a significant reduction in the IC50of metformin against KP4 pancreatic cancer cells when used in conjunction
with BQACs. The combination indexes for this pairing fell significantly
below 1, indicating a synergistic effect, which suggests that this
strategic combination may increase metformin uptake and efficacy at
lower concentrations (TableandFigure).

against KP4 cells in combination with BQACs
at a molar ratio of 50:1 MET/BQAC. ****p≤
0.0001 (ANOVA).

The consequences
of metformin’s mechanism of action, particularly its interaction
with complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, lead to the
activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through phosphorylation.
To assess the synergistic effects of the metformin/BQAC combination,
we quantified the levels of phosphorylated AMPK (P-AMPK) relative
to the total level of AMPK in the KP4 cell line (Figure).

BQACs alone and in combination on P-AMPK

to AMPK levels. *p≤ 0.05 (ANOVA).

In this study, KP4 cells were treated with metformin
at a concentration
of 100 μM and BQACs at 2 μM for 48 h. This was compared
to KP4 cells treated with a 50:1 ratio of metformin/BQAC (100 μM
and 2 μM, respectively). The observed increase in phosphorylated
AMPK levels following treatment with the various combinations, compared
to KP4 cells treated with metformin alone, indicates improved uptake
of metformin and effective action at sub-IC50concentrations
when administered in conjunction with BQACs. Specifically, the P-AMPK/AMPK
ratio was significantly enhanced in KP4 cells treated with compounds9aand11a, whereas treatment with 100 μM
metformin and BQACs separately showed no significant increase in P-AMPK
levels.

In summary, we designed
and synthesized
a series of BQAC based
on benzimidazolium and quinolinium, followed by a comprehensive pancreatic
anticancer activity study. Our results revealed that these bicationic
compounds exhibited significant cytotoxicity against KP4 and PANC1
pancreatic cancer cells. Analysis of the IC50values for
the initial series indicated that compounds with lower hydrophobicity
displayed minimal toxicity toward normal pancreatic and lung fibroblast
cell lines. This observation led us to investigate the design of more
hydrophilic biquaternary ammonium compounds by incorporating functional
groups such as 2-aminobenzimidazolium, dimethoxybenzimidazolium, and
benzimidazolium-dimethoxyisoquinolinium to enhance their therapeutic
potential.

Among the compounds studied,8a,9a,11a,26, and31emerged as the most
selective agents, demonstrating favorable selectivity for the KP4
and PANC1 cell lines with minimal antiproliferative effects on IMR90
lung fibroblasts, even at concentrations up to ten times their IC50values against KP4 cells. Their selectivity was attributed
to interactions between the cationic moieties of these compounds and
the anionic residues on cancer cell membranes; however, their mechanisms
of action did not involve significant disruption of the cell membrane.

To investigate the intracellular dynamics of these BQAC derivatives,
the photoactive compounds16aand16bwere
utilized, confirming their ability to enter the cytoplasm and specifically
localize within mitochondria. Our findings indicate that the structural
designs of compounds8a,9a,11a,26, and31, which balance cationic moieties
and amphiphilic surfaces, facilitate their selective targeting of
cancer cell membranes, and transmembrane passage without causing irreversible
membrane permeabilization. In the cytoplasm, these compounds are drawn
to mitochondria due to electrostatic interactions, where their accumulation
disrupts mitochondrial integrity.

Additionally, our exploration
of the combined anticancer effects
of these compounds with two chemotherapeutic drugs: doxorubicin and
metformin, revealed an additive effect with doxorubicin and a synergistic
interaction with metformin, which significantly enhanced metformin
uptake and efficacy in mitochondria. This synergy is likely due to
a BQAC-induced increased drug uptake, amplifying metformin’s
efficacy. It is important to note thatin vitroselectivity
data have limitations, as they do not fully replicate the tumor microenvironment,
metabolic processes, or resistance mechanisms foundin vivo. Cell line models may not capture patient tumor heterogeneity, and
drug concentrations testedin vitromay not reflect
achievable systemic levels. To address these limitations, we plan
to validate BQACs in pancreatic cancer xenograft and orthotopic mouse
models, assessing their pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and interactions
with the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, biomarker analysis
and comparative studies with standard therapies will help determine
their clinical potential and optimize combination strategies with
metformin.

The strategy proposed here highlights the advantages
of combination
therapy in enhancing the intracellular uptake of poorly bioavailable
anticancer drugs, thereby addressing the challenge of drug resistance
in cancer treatment. Through these findings, we aspire to pave the
way for more effective cancer therapies and optimize BQACs as therapeutic
components.

Cancer cells (KP4,

cells were treated with 100 μL of prepared aliquots of the test
compounds diluted in DMEM. Controls included wells without cells (blank,

a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer. Equal amounts of protein were
separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were
briefly revealed by Ponceau Red dye and membranes were washed with
PBS-Tween 0.05% (PBS-T), before blocking with 5% milk proteins for
1 h. Membranes were washed again with PBS-T and incubated with the
primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T
three times, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody
for 1 h. After being washed with PBS-T three times, membranes were
visualized by chemiluminescence using a Western Lightning Plus Chemiluminescence
Reagent.
