Prolonged preoperative fasting may increase anxiety, insulin resistance, and surgical stress, whereas preoperative carbohydrate loading has been shown to improve metabolic response, reduce complications, and enhance recovery, as supported by ERAS protocols.

This study aimed to examine the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate ingestion on postoperative glucometabolic response, subjective well-being, quality of life, and surgical clinical outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

A prospective, randomized controlled double-blind study was conducted in a hospital in the Aegean region of Türkiye, including 50 patients scheduled for elective colorectal surgery. Data were collected using a structured form that included sociodemographic information, perioperative laboratory values, subjective well-being indicators, and the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale. The intervention group received 800 mL of a carbohydrate drink until midnight and 400 mL two hours before surgery; the control group received the same volumes of water. Participants, outcome assessors, and statistical analysts were blinded to group assignments. The researcher who administered the drinks was aware of group allocation but was not involved in outcome evaluation or data analysis.

The intervention group had shorter time to first flatulence (40.60 ± 4.52 vs 46.00 ± 4.22 h,p< 0.001), earlier defecation (68.64 ± 7.94 vs 81.84 ± 8.97 h,p< 0.001), earlier oral feeding (43.80 ± 4.84 vs 48.44 ± 3.87 h,p< 0.001), and shorter hospital stay (10.64 ± 1.52 vs 14.32 ± 3.69 days,p< 0.001) compared to the control group. Postoperative albumin levels were significantly higher and CRP levels significantly lower in the intervention group at 24 h. The SF-36 physical functioning score was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (82.00 ± 11.81 vs 61.40 ± 16.17,p< 0.001). No significant differences were found in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), gastric volume, or pH between groups.

Preoperative oral carbohydrate intake was associated with improved clinical recovery indicators and quality of life outcomes. In particular, it contributed to earlier return of bowel function, reduced postoperative discomfort, and significantly shorter hospital stay, indicating enhanced postoperative recovery in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

Preoperative fasting has traditionally been a standard practice for patients undergoing elective surgery, primarily aimed at reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration [1]. However, prolonged fasting periods have been associated with increased preoperative anxiety, delayed surgical recovery, and heightened perioperative insulin resistance (PIR) [2,3]. Surgical trauma, combined with prolonged fasting, exacerbates catabolic processes and triggers a metabolic stress response, leading to increased patient discomfort and complications [4,5]. In response to these challenges, recent research and evidence-based guidelines have shifted focus toward minimizing the duration of preoperative fasting. Notably, the administration of oral carbohydrates in the preoperative period has been recommended to mitigate these adverse effects [6,7].

The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols advocate for preoperative oral carbohydrate loading, particularly in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery [6]. Preoperative carbohydrate intake has been shown to modulate perioperative metabolism, reduce the stress response to surgical trauma, prevent complications, improve surgical outcomes, shorten hospital stays, and decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality [8–11]. The International Society of Anaesthesia has confirmed the safety of oral carbohydrate intake, stating that it does not increase the risk of anesthesia-related complications. Furthermore, reducing the fasting period and administering carbohydrate-containing liquids have been shown to alleviate perioperative thirst, hunger, fatigue, anxiety, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and to promote intestinal peristalsis and shorter hospital stays [12–15].

Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the comprehensive impact of preoperative carbohydrate loading on postoperative quality of life and subjective well-being, particularly in the context of colorectal surgery. While previous studies have primarily focused on metabolic outcomes and clinical recovery parameters, the effects on patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and subjective well-being have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to address this gap by examining the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate ingestion on postoperative glucometabolic response, subjective well-being, quality of life, and surgical clinical outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

While previous studies have made valuable contributions by examining short-term metabolic parameters and clinical outcomes such as glucose levels and length of stay, there remains a need for studies that additionally explore patient-reported outcomes—including subjective well-being and long-term quality of life—within a methodologically rigorous framework.

This study aims to address that gap by examining the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate ingestion not only on glucometabolic responses and early postoperative recovery, but also on subjective well-being indicators (e.g., thirst, hunger, fatigue, anxiety) and health-related quality of life, measured 30 days after surgery via the validated SF-36 instrument. To our knowledge, this is among the first randomized controlled trials in colorectal surgery to combine these multiple outcome domains within a double-blind study design, thereby minimizing bias and enhancing the interpretability of findings. By adopting a holistic and patient-centered approach, this study contributes novel insights that may inform enhanced recovery protocols and optimize perioperative care practices.

H1: Preoperative oral carbohydrate intake contributes to improved postoperative recovery in patients undergoing colorectal surgery by reducing insulin resistance, enhancing subjective well-being, and increasing quality of life.

This prospective, randomized controlled double-blind study was conducted at the General Surgery Clinic of A University Hospital between January 2022 and April 2023. The sample size was determined based on an effect size calculation derived from a previous study by Yagci et al. [3], which reported a mean glucose level difference of 12.18 mg/dL between the experimental and control groups. Using this data, the effect size (d) was calculated as 0.72. With a 95% confidence level (1-α) and 80% statistical power (1-β), the G*Power software (version 3.1) was used to determine that a minimum of 25 participants per group (50 participants in total) would be required to detect significant differences between the groups. A total of 57 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 7 patients were excluded prior to randomization due to diabetes (n= 5) and ASA score IV or above (n= 2). The remaining 50 patients were randomly assigned to the study groups, and all participants completed the study as scheduled. Therefore, no dropouts occurred, and a follow-up rate of 100% was achieved.

The study population consisted of patients aged 18 years or older who were scheduled for elective colorectal surgery and had the capacity to provide informed consent. Participants were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I, II, or III. Exclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), severe liver or kidney failure, hiatal hernia, or those with oral nutrition difficulties. Additionally, emergency cases and patients classified as ASA IV or higher were excluded from the study. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the relevant institutional clinical research ethics committee prior to data collection.

The study was conducted in compliance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines to ensure transparent and standardized reporting of randomized controlled trials.

Randomization was performed by a researcher who was not directly involved in the clinical aspects of the study, using a computer-generated random sequence (https://www.random.org) to assign 50 patients to two groups in an unbiased manner. The allocation list was concealed from patients and from all researchers responsible for patient registration and evaluation until the completion of data collection. To maintain blinding, study beverages were prepared in identical bottles by a nutrition company employee who was not part of the research team. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed independently by an experienced statistician who was also blinded to group assignments. While patients, outcome assessors, and statisticians remained blinded throughout the study, the researcher administering the beverages was necessarily aware of group allocations. However, this researcher did not participate in outcome assessment or data analysis to preserve the integrity of the blinding process.

Randomization was performed by a researcher who were not directly involved in the clinical aspects of the study, with a sequence generated by a computer program (https://www.random.org) to assign 50 patients randomly to 2 groups in an unbiased manner. The list was kept secret from the patients and the researchers who registered and evaluated the patients until the final of the study. To maintain blinding, the study beverages were prepared in bottles of the same form by a nutrition company employee who was not actively engaged in the research process. Additionaly, the statistical analysis was performed independently by an experienced statistician, who was not directly involved in the study.

While the patients, evaluating clinicians, and statistical analysts remained blinded throughout the study, the researcher administering the beverages was necessarily aware of group allocation. Importantly, this researcher did not participate in outcome evaluation or statistical interpretation to preserve the integrity of the blinding process.

Reducing insulin resistance (below 2.5 mg/dl), shortening hospital stay, ensuring subjective well-being.

The early return of bowel movements, shorter passing-gas time, and higher quality of life on the 30th day after surgery were observed in patients who received carbohydrate-rich drinks.

Intervention Group: Patients in the intervention group were administered 800 mL of a carbohydrate-rich drink (12.5 g carbohydrate per 100 mL, containing 12% monosaccharides, 12% disaccharides, and 76% polysaccharides, with an osmolality of 285 mOsm/kg) until midnight on the day before surgery. Additionally, 400 mL of the same carbohydrate drink was given 2–3 h before the surgical procedure (Fig.1).

Control Group: Patients in the control group received 800 mL of water until midnight on the day before surgery and 400 mL of water 2–3 h before the procedure (Fig.1).

To maintain visual and procedural blinding, both types of beverages were prepared in identical, unlabeled bottles. Although the contents differed (carbohydrate-containing drink vs. water), all beverages were colorless and served at the same volume and temperature. This standardization was implemented to minimize the likelihood that participants could identify their group allocation.

Age, gender, education level, marital status, occupation, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol use, presence of chronic diseases, ASA score, and clinical outcomes (time to first flatulence, first defecation, first oral feeding, first mobilization, and hospital stay) were questioned in the form developed by the investigators.

The findings, including gastric pH, gastric volume, and blood markers (glucose, insulin, cortisol, albumin, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and urea), were measured at specific time points (preoperative and postoperative 24 h) using a form developed by the researchers.

Postoperative comfort indicators (pain, thirst, hunger, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety) were assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

The VAS is a 10 cm horizontal or vertical line, with endpoints labeled “ No symptoms/pain “ ‘0’ and “The worst symptom imaginable/Unbearable Pain” ‘10’. Patients mark their level of discomfort on the line, and the score is measured in centimeters. A score of 0 indicates no discomfort, 1–4 indicates mild discomfort, 5–6 indicates moderate discomfort, and 7–10 indicates severe discomfort [16]. The VAS was administered at specific postoperative time points (e.g., 8, 12, and 24 h) to evaluate changes in subjective well-being.

The SF-36 Quality of Life Scale was used to evaluate eight health domains 30 days after surgery. The scale was developed by Ware et al. in 1992 [17]. The Turkish validity and reliability of the scale was performed by Koçyiğit et al. [18]. The SF-36 is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 36 items that assess physical functionality, social functionality, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, mental health, vitality, pain, and general health perception. Each domain is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life [18]. The SF-36 was administered 30 days postoperatively to assess the long-term impact of preoperative carbohydrate intake on patients’ quality of life.

Patients were informed about the study during their preoperative assessment and provided both verbal and written consent.

Participants were instructed to maintain regular eating and sleeping patterns for three days prior to hospitalization.

Blood samples were collected at four time points: before the morning dose, 40 min and 90 min after drink ingestion, and during anesthesia induction.

Gastric residue was measured intraoperatively using a nasogastric or orogastric tube, and pH values were recorded using a urine pH meter.

The consent process and preoperative instructions were carried out by the first researcher. Blood sampling was performed by clinical staff in coordination with the research team. Intraoperative measurements (gastric residue and pH) were conducted by the surgical or anesthesia team. The results were recorded in the study forms by the second researcher, who was blinded to group allocation.

The statistical analysis was conducted via the IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The distribution of scores obtained from each continuous variable was investigated using a combination of descriptive, graphical and statistical methods. The Shapiro–Wilk test was employed to ascertain the normality of the scores obtained from each continuous variable using a statistical methodology. Even for variables that did not follow a normal distribution, means and standard deviations were reported, as they better reflect the degree of heterogeneity in continuous variables, particularly in instruments like SF-36. Categorical variable data are presented as frequencies (n, %), while continuous variable data are presented as means ± standard deviations. In order to make comparisons between two groups in relation to normally distributed quantitative variables, an independent sample t-test was employed. Conversely, when the variables in question were not normally distributed, a Mann–Whitney U test was used. To compare qualitative data between groups, chi-square tests (including the Yates correction and Fisher’s exact test) were employed. The results were evaluated for statistical significance within the 95% confidence interval, withp< 0.05 deemed significant.

The mean age of the patients included in the study was 66.64 ± 10.26 years, 52% were male, the average BMI level was 25.44 ± 3.37, 84% were married, and 74% were primary education. It was determined that 30% of the participants smoked, 20% consumed alcohol and 72% had a chronic disease. No statistically significant differences were observed in the distribution of the descriptive characteristics of the patients according to the research groups (Table1).

In the preoperative period, a comparison was made among the patients in the experimental group and those in the control group in the postoperative period; gas (40.60 ± 4.52 vs 46.00 ± 4.22), stool passage (68.64 ± 7.94 vs 81.84 ± 8.97), transition to oral feeding (43.80 ± 4.84 vs 48.44 ± 3.87) and length of stay (10.64 ± 1.52 vs 14.32 ± 3.69) were statistically significantly shorter (Z = −3.675 to −4.721;p< 0.001) (Table2).

The plasma glucose level in the patients in the experimental group was found to be statistically significantly lower in the preoperative period (80.24 ± 7.66 vs 94.75 ± 19.35; Z = −3.150;p= 0.002). However, plasma glucose (123.80 ± 18.96 vs 107.47 ± 22.66; Z = −3.611;p< 0.001) and insulin (11.91 ± 4.16 vs 9.68 ± 1.71; Z = −2.184;p= 0.029) levels were determined to be higher in the measurement made during anaesthesia induction. Preoperative CRP (4.61 ± 11.61 vs 54.91 ± 95.83; Z = −2.484;p= 0.013) and both preoperative (23.01 ± 5.65 vs 29.65 ± 15.74; Z = −2.125;p= 0.034) and postoperative (20.84 ± 4.72 vs 32.64 ± 35.38; Z = −2.057;p= 0.040) 24th hour urea levels were significantly lower in the patients in the experimental group; It was determined that preoperative magnesium (2.47 ± 0.62 vs 2.05 ± 0.36; Z = 2.244;p= 0.025), postoperative 24th hour potassium (4.35 ± 0.36 vs 4.04 ± 0.51; Z = −2.110;p= 0.035) and both preoperative (43.64 ± 3.28 vs 37.57 ± 8.64; Z = −2.935;p= 0.003) and postoperative (40.72 ± 4.13 vs 33.07 ± 8.28t= 4.135;p< 0.001) 24th hour albumin levels were significantly higher (Table2).

When the SF-36 quality of life scale scores of the patients were examined, except for the vitality and emotional role difficulty sub-dimensions (p> 0.05), all other sub-dimensions were different between the research groups (p< 0.01 andp< 0.001). It was demonstrated that the quality of life, as measured by physical functionality (82.00 ± 11.81 vs 61.40 ± 16.17), physical role difficulties (63.00 ± 30.72 vs 37.00 ± 30.72), general health (68.80 ± 15.09 vs 54.00 ± 10.31), pain (73.20 ± 13.95 vs 62.30 ± 9.92), social function (71.00 ± 22.16 vs 49.50 ± 13.73) and mental health (83.36 ± 7.36 vs 73.60 ± 10.58), was significantly superior in the patients in the experimental group (Table2).

Thirst at the 8th postoperative hour (1.00 ± 1.91 vs 1.52 ± 1.23; Z = −2.360;p= 0.018); The level of hunger (1.36 ± 1.66 vs 2.52 ± 1.76; Z = −2.802;p= 0.005) at the 12th hour and pain (3.12 ± 0.97 vs 3.88 ± 0.93; Z = −2.675;p= 0.007) at the 24th hour in the patients in the experimental group; It was established that the level of fatigue at the 12th (2.76 ± 0.97 vs 1.32 ± 1.31; Z = 3.805;p< 0.001) and 24th (3.84 ± 1.25 vs 1.72 ± 1.54; Z = −4.699;p< 0.001) postoperative hours (p< 0.001) was significantly better only in the in the control group patients (Table3).

This study contributes to the expanding research on preoperative carbohydrate loading by employing a double-blind randomized controlled design to assess both objective clinical outcomes and subjective patient-reported measures. Unlike previous studies, which primarily examined short-term metabolic effects or perioperative comfort, our research broadens the scope by incorporating 30-day postoperative quality of life (measured with the SF-36 instrument) as well as detailed evaluations of subjective well-being, including thirst, pain, anxiety, and fatigue. By adopting this multidimensional approach, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of how preoperative carbohydrate intake influences patient recovery.

The findings reveal that patients who received carbohydrate loading reported significantly better scores in both physical and mental health domains of the SF-36 compared to the control group. Additionally, subjective measures such as reduced thirst, lower pain levels, and decreased anxiety further underscore the potential benefits of this intervention. These results suggest that preoperative carbohydrate loading not only enhances metabolic recovery but also improves overall patient well-being in the early postoperative period.

Since the introduction of shortened fasting protocols, no adverse events or complications have been reported [13]. Preoperative carbohydrate-rich beverages have been shown to reduce tissue damage and insulin resistance by enhancing glycogen storage. Furthermore, they improve patient comfort, reduce anxiety, and shorten hospital stays [13,19]. In this study, we compared patients receiving carbohydrate-rich drinks with those receiving only water, focusing on postoperative glucometabolic response, subjective well-being, clinical outcomes, and quality of life.

Previous studies have found no significant differences in glucose levels between carbohydrate and control/water groups [9,13–15,20,21]. Similarly, in this study, plasma glucose levels were lower preoperatively in the intervention group but higher during anesthesia induction. These findings align with prior research, indicating an increase in glucose levels during the preoperative period and anesthesia induction. Insulin resistance is a transient metabolic response to stress, with its severity linked to the extent of tissue injury [13]. Traditional fasting exacerbates this resistance, while preoperative carbohydrate loading increases insulin levels and reduces insulin resistance. Some studies report higher insulin levels in carbohydrate groups [3,13,22], while others show significantly lower insulin resistance in these groups [23,24]. However, three studies found no significant differences in insulin resistance between groups, despite baseline increases [14,25]. In this study, the experimental group had higher preoperative insulin levels than the control group, but no significant difference in HOMA-IR values was observed. Concerns about pulmonary aspiration from preoperative drinks persist. However, a gamma camera study showed that gastric emptying occurs within 90 min after consuming 400 mL of a 12.5% carbohydrate drink, with no significant difference in gastric volume between carbohydrate and control groups before anesthesia [11]. Most studies indicate that carbohydrate drinks do not affect gastric volume or pH [3,26], though one study reported reduced volume and increased pH in the carbohydrate group [27]. In this study, neither carbohydrate nor water significantly altered gastric volume or pH.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a positive acute-phase protein that reflects inflammation severity and predicts postoperative complications. In contrast, negative acute-phase proteins like albumin decrease post-surgery due to pro-inflammatory cytokines. While albumin is often used as a nutritional marker, hypoalbuminemia can also indicate an acute-phase response mediated by inflammation [25]. Previous studies found no significant differences in serum CRP levels between groups [15,25,28]. In this study, CRP levels were higher preoperatively in the control group, but no significant difference was observed at 24 h postoperatively. While Hamamoto et al. [29] reported no differences in albumin levels, this study found significantly higher preoperative and 24-h postoperative albumin levels in the experimental group. These findings suggest that carbohydrate-rich beverages may reduce the inflammatory response. However, despite proper randomization, statistically significant preoperative differences were observed between the groups in terms of CRP, albumin, and magnesium levels. These baseline imbalances may reflect individual variability in nutritional and inflammatory status rather than systematic bias [14]. Given that CRP is a positive acute-phase protein and albumin a negative one, such differences could influence how postoperative responses are interpreted [21,28]. While ANCOVA or similar adjustments were not applied due to the limited sample size, we believe the overall trend of improved outcomes in the intervention group remains valid. Nevertheless, this limitation necessitates a cautious interpretation of these specific markers, and future studies with larger cohorts are recommended to control for such imbalances statistically.

Previous studies found no significant differences in gas passage, stool output, transition to oral feeding, or hospital stay between groups [14,30]. However, some studies suggest earlier gastrointestinal recovery in carbohydrate groups [29]. While most studies report no significant reduction in hospital stay with carbohydrate drinks [14,23], two studies found a significant decrease [24,25]. In this study, the experimental group showed significantly shorter times to gas passage, stool output, oral feeding, mobilization, and hospital stay.

The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess subjective well-being indicators, including hunger, thirst, dry mouth, nausea, pain, and anxiety. While some studies found no effect of carbohydrate drinks on postoperative pain [12,15,31,32], others reported significant pain reduction [13,33]. In this study, pain levels were significantly lower in the experimental group at 24 h postoperatively. This finding suggests that preoperative carbohydrate intake may enhance patient comfort and contribute to a smoother recovery process by alleviating postoperative pain. Previous studies have yielded mixed results regarding the impact of different approaches on nausea. Some found significant reductions [26,33], while others reported no substantial difference [14,23,24,27]. In this study, nausea was consistently less frequent in the experimental group, with a significant difference observed during the preoperative period. The effects of carbohydrate drinks on anxiety, depression, and postoperative outcomes have yielded mixed findings across studies. While some research demonstrates a significant reduction in anxiety [26,27], others report no notable differences [24]. An unexpected finding in this study was the significantly lower fatigue scores in the control group at the 12th and 24th postoperative hours. While the experimental group showed favorable results in most subjective well-being indicators, this discrepancy in fatigue warrants further consideration. One potential explanation may relate to the glycemic and hormonal responses to carbohydrate loading. Elevated insulin levels, observed in the intervention group during anesthesia induction, might have influenced central fatigue perception or neurometabolic regulation [13]. Additionally, individual variability in carbohydrate tolerance or the osmolarity of the solution could have contributed to transient discomfort or perceived Fatigue [11]. Given the novelty of this finding, we recommend further mechanistic studies to elucidate the metabolic and psychological pathways underlying this response. In this study, thirst scores at the 8th postoperative hour and hunger scores at the 12th hour were measured in the experimental group. Interestingly, fatigue levels at the 12th and 24th postoperative hours were significantly lower in the control group. These results suggest that preoperative administration of carbohydrate-rich drinks may positively influence patients’ subjective well-being.

Furthermore,the study assessed patients’ quality of life 30 days post-surgery. The experimental group showed significantly better outcomes in physical functionality, pain, physical role limitations, general health, social functioning, and mental health compared to the control group. Although prior studies have explored patient comfort and satisfaction with preoperative carbohydrate drinks [13,24], no existing literature has specifically examined their impact on long-term quality of life. Our findings thus provide novel evidence that preoperative carbohydrate-rich drinks significantly enhance patients’ quality of life. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents one of the first comprehensive evaluations of long-term quality of life after colorectal surgery within the framework of preoperative carbohydrate loading, providing unique insights into sustained patient-centered outcomes beyond the acute recovery phase.

The study employed a double-blind randomized controlled design. Both participants and outcome evaluators were blinded to group assignments. Although the researcher who administered the intervention was not blinded, they were not involved in outcome evaluation or statistical analysis, thus minimizing bias.

The study included a comprehensive evaluation of both preoperative and postoperative subjective well-being, as well as 30-day postoperative quality of life (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and mental health).

The incorporation of 30-day quality-of-life assessments alongside validated, multidimensional patient-reported outcome measures strengthens both the clinical applicability and methodological rigor of our findings.

The study was conducted in a single-center setting, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Multicenter studies with larger and more diverse populations are needed.

Cancer stage and duration of surgery were not recorded, although both may influence postoperative outcomes. This is acknowledged as a limitation of the study design.

Despite proper randomization, significant preoperative differences were observed in CRP, albumin, and magnesium levels between groups. These imbalances may reflect individual variability in nutritional or inflammatory status and may affect baseline comparability.

In conclusion, preoperative carbohydrate intake reduces the postoperative glucometabolic response, enhances subjective well-being, and improves clinical outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Furthermore, it significantly contributes to patients’ quality of life in the postoperative period. This study not only supports existing evidence on the benefits of carbohydrate drinks but also provides novel insights by evaluating their long-term impact on quality of life, an area previously underexplored in the literature. These findings underscore the importance of preoperative carbohydrate administration as a simple yet effective intervention to optimize patient outcomes.
