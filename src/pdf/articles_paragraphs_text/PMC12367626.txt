Bidens pilosa L(BL), known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties across multiple malignancies, was investigated for its potential therapeutic effects against esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Through integrative network pharmacology and computational approaches, 10 bioactive compounds from BL were identified from HERB 2.0, symMap, BATMAN-TCM (target prediction score cutoff = 20, adjustedP-value = 0.05 for target analyses), TCMSP (oral bioavailability ≥ 30% and drug likeness ≥ 0.18), and ETCM 2.0 databases, while 3,993 ESCC-associated targets were retrieved from OMIM, GeneCards, and DisGeNET. Cross-analysis revealed 214 shared targets, with tyrosine-protein kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase emerging as central hubs in protein-protein interaction networks. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted significant involvement in cellular responses to hormone stimuli, nitrogen compounds, and phosphorylation, with key pathways including cancer, PI3K-Akt, and Ras signaling. Molecular docking demonstrated high-affinity binding of (2E)-2-(3,4-Dihydroxybenzylidene)-6,7-Dihydroxy-Benzofuran-3-One (− 10.4 kcal/mol), Luteolin (− 10.1 kcal/mol), and Okanin (− 9.7 kcal/mol) to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), specifically targeting catalytic residues GLU227 and TYR245. Quantum chemical calculations further revealed narrow HOMO-LUMO gaps for Luteolin (ΔE = 2.41 eV) and Okanin (ΔE = 2.93 eV), indicating high reactivity, while molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable MMP9-ligand complexes (nearly − 200 kJ/mol), with Okanin exhibiting faster equilibration than Luteolin. The analysis of datasets from TCGA and GEO revealed that MMP9 is significantly upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared to normal esophageal tissues. Meanwhile, Luteolin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) capabilities of ESCC in vitro experiments.These findings collectively suggest that BL exerts anti-ESCC effects in silico through multi-target synergy, with Luteolin and Okanin identified as promising MMP9 inhibitors, providing a mechanistic foundation for future drug development.

Esophageal cancer (EC) represents a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, demonstrating particularly poor clinical outcomes [1]. Approximately 80% of EC cases globally are classified as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), constituting the predominant histological subtype [2,3]. Despite therapeutic advances in systemic treatment, radiotherapy, and surgical interventions, ESCC remains challenging to manage, with a dismal five-year survival rate of merely 5% [4]. Current clinical practice emphasizes surgical resection as the primary treatment modality, typically combined with chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy in comprehensive treatment strategies. However, systemic chemotherapy for ESCC presents notable limitations, including substantial toxicity and the frequent development of drug resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify suitable therapeutic agents.

In contrast, plant-derived natural products have emerged as a promising source of low-toxicity anticancer agents with demonstrated efficacy [5]. Traditional Chinese medicine predominantly utilizes plant-based therapeutics, and it has garnered increasing attention for its potential role in ESCC treatment, with growing evidence supporting its clinical utility [6,7].Bidens pilosa L(BL), an annual herbaceous plant of the asteraceae family, has gained significant attention for its medicinal properties. The whole plant is used medicinally and is characterized by a bitter taste, neutral nature, and non-toxicity. Traditionally, it has been employed for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, fatigue-alleviating, and anti-inflammatory effects. Emerging evidence suggests that BL exhibits therapeutic potential in immune-related disorders, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, allergies, and infections [8,9]. Its pharmacological activity is attributed to a diverse array of bioactive compounds. Notably, extracts of BL have demonstrated anticancer effects against various malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, melanoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. In vitro studies have revealed that hydroethanolic crude extracts and supercritical fluid extracts derived from the aerial parts of BL exhibit concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against human breast carcinoma cells. In vivo investigations using A549 xenograft mouse models further support these findings, showing that oral administration of BL extract significantly inhibits tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice [9]. Despite extensive research on BL’s anticancer properties in various malignancies [9–13], its specific mechanisms of action against ESCC remain poorly understood.

To systematically investigate the pharmacological actions of BL in ESCC, a big data-driven approach was employed to identify potential therapeutic targets and associated signaling pathways. Network pharmacology, an interdisciplinary strategy integrating bioinformatics and pharmacological methodologies, was utilized to analyze complex drug-disease interactions. By leveraging computational modeling and data integration, this approach facilitates the construction of structured drug-target-pathway networks, thereby elucidating the underlying mechanisms of BL in ESCC treatment [14].

This study utilized an integrated computational approach, incorporating network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations, to systematically explore the potential therapeutic targets of BL and its associated signaling pathways in the treatment of ESCC. The findings provide mechanistic insights into the pharmacological actions of BL, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ESCC. Furthermore, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of ESCC treatment strategies and offers a foundation for future drug development.

Potential bioactive compounds were systematically retrieved from multiple traditional Chinese medicine databases: TCMSP (http://lsp.nwu.edu.cn/tcmsp.php; screening criteria: OB ≥ 30% and DL ≥ 0.18), BATMAN-TCM (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman-tcm; screening criteria: the target prediction score cutoff and the adjustedP-value threshold for target analyses were maintained at their default values of 20 and 0.05, respectively). For other TCM databases (including ETCM:http://www.tcmip.cn/ETCM, SymMap:http://www.symmap.org, and TCM Database@Taiwan:http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw), a standard default search was applied. The putative targets of these compounds were subsequently predicted using the Swiss Target Prediction platform (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch) with a probability cutoff > 0.

ESCC-related targets were systematically retrieved from three authoritative disease databases: (1) GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/), (2) DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/), and (3) OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man;https://www.omim.org/), using “esophageal squamous cell carcinoma” as the standardized search term.

The shared targets between BL components and ESCC were identified using Venny 2.1 (https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed through STRING v11.0 (https://string-db.org/; species: Homo sapiens; confidence score cutoff: 0.4). The network was then visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape v3.9.1 (https://cytoscape.org/) with its built-in tools to identify core therapeutic targets.

Computational functional profiling was executed in Metascape with stringent parameters (Homo sapiens; min overlap = 3;p≤ 0.05; enrichment ≥ 1.5). The analytical workflow incorporated: (i) Gene Ontology (GO) annotation focusing on biological processes and (ii) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Results meeting statistical significance criteria were subsequently visualized.

Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock v1.2.3 to assess the binding interactions between selected active compounds (identified from the PPI network) and their respective receptors. The molecular weights and 3D structures of BL-derived compounds were retrieved from PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), while receptor structures were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/). Prior to docking, ligand and target preparation was conducted using AutoDock tools. For the target proteins, preprocessing steps included removal of crystallographic water molecules, hydrogen addition, amino acid modification, energy minimization, and force field parameter optimization to ensure low-energy conformations. The docking simulations evaluated binding affinities (expressed in kcal/mol), with stronger negative values indicating more favorable ligand-target interactions. Finally, the resulting complexes were visualized and analyzed using Discovery Studio software.

To assess MMP9 mRNA levels in ESCC, we analyzed TCGA data obtained from the UALCAN platform (https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/cgi-bin/TCGAExResultNew2.pl?genenam=MMP9%26ctype=ESCA%26add=1), which included 95 ESCC cases, 89 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cases, and 11 normal esophageal tissue samples. Additionally, we incorporated theGSE161533dataset from the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), containing gene expression profiles of both normal and ESCC tissues. Differentially expressed mRNAs were identified using R, with significance thresholds set at an adjustedP-value < 0.05 and |logFC|≥2.0. Raw data were downloaded, and log2-transformed FPKM values were normalized for subsequent analysis. The normalized data were then used to quantify MMP9 mRNA expression levels in normal versus ESCC tissues, with statistical significance defined asP< 0.05.

The Gaussian16 computational chemistry package was employed to conduct all quantum chemical calculations in this study. Structural optimizations and vibrational frequency analyses were performed using the B3LYP-D3(BJ) density functional method, which incorporates Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson damping. For these computations, the def2-SVP basis set was consistently applied. Subsequently, the Multiwfn 3.8 software was utilized to extract frontier molecular orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO) and generate corresponding cube files. The final visualization of molecular orbital isosurfaces was achieved through the ChimeraX 1.9 molecular graphics system.

To study the binding interactions of the system, standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out with the GROMACS software (version 2024.03). The protein was described using the amber14sb force field, and the system was solvated with the TIP3P water model. For ligand parameterization, the AnteChamber Python Parser Interface (ACPYPE) was applied along with the amber14 force field. The protein-ligand complexes were immersed in an octahedral water box, and charge neutrality was achieved by introducing 0.150 M sodium and chloride ions. Initially, the system underwent energy minimization via the steepest descent algorithm for 50,000 steps. Subsequent equilibration involved NVT (constant volume and temperature) and NPT (constant pressure and temperature) phases, each running for 50,000 steps while restraining the heavy atoms. Temperature and pressure were regulated at 300 K and 1 bar, respectively, to stabilize the system. Finally, a 100 ns production MD simulation was performed without restraints, with energy and trajectory data being saved at 10 ps intervals.

The human ESCC cell lines TE-13 and KYSE-510 were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection (CBTCC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 10³ cells/well (100 µL/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Following incubation, the cells were treated with Luteolin (120 µM) for 24–48 h. After treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Japan) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 3 h at 37℃ in a humidified 5% CO₂ atmosphere. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Victor1420, PerkinElmer, USA). Each experimental condition was performed in quintuplicate, and the entire assay was repeated independently at least three times.

ESCC cells were grown to confluence in 35 mm dishes. A linear scratch wound was generated in the cell monolayer using a sterile 10 µL pipette tip. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove dislodged cells, the cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) or luteolin (10 µM and 20 µM) in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 ℃ in a 5% CO2atmosphere for 24 h. Wound closure was assessed by capturing images at 0 h and 24 h post-scratch using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. The migration rate was quantified by measuring the remaining scratch area with ImageJ software (v1.8.0, National Institutes of Health, USA), and results were expressed as the percentage of wound closure relative to the initial wound area.

Cells were resuspended in serum-free Opti-Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at a density of 3 × 10⁴ cells/mL. Subsequently, 50 µL of Matrigel (Millipore Sigma) was evenly coated onto the upper chamber, while 600 µL of 10% RPMI-1640 medium was gently added to the basolateral chamber. The chambers were incubated at 37℃ for 1 h to allow matrix solidification. Following incubation, the chambers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then stained with 1% crystal violet for 1 h at room temperature. Migrated cells were quantified by manual counting under an inverted microscope.

Total protein was extracted from cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and protein concentration was determined with a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Proteins (50 µg per sample) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h at 37 ℃, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: N-cadherin (1:5000; Abcam, cat. no. ab76011), MMP-9 (1:1000; Abcam, cat. no. ab76003), Snail (1:1000; Abcam, cat. no. ab216347), and β-actin (1:5000; Abcam, cat. no. ab6276). Subsequently, membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies—Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (1:10,000; Abcam, cat. no. ab6721) or Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (1:10,000; Abcam, cat. no. ab6789) for 2 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using an ECL detection system (Solarbia S&T Co., Ltd.), and densitometric analysis was performed with Image Lab v3.0 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) on a Bio-Rad imaging system.

All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp.). For comparisons involving three or more groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. AP-value < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.

Comprehensive database mining identified 10 bioactive compounds from BL (listed in Table1), and these compounds collectively target 333 potential proteins. Parallel analysis of ESCC pathogenesis revealed 3,993 disease-associated targets through integrated data from GeneCards (n= 2938), OMIM (n= 429), and DisGeNET (n= 1593). Venn analysis demonstrated significant convergence between the phytochemical targets and ESCC pathology, with 214 shared targets (Fig.1A), suggesting potential therapeutic mechanisms.

The 214 predicted targets were analyzed using the STRING database to construct a PPI network, which comprised 199 nodes and 1,860 edges (Fig.1B). The top 20 hub targets were ranked by degree centrality (DC). Key targets included tyrosine-protein kinase (SRC, DC = 96), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, DC = 94), alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1, DC = 86), apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (BCL2, DC = 80), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A, DC = 70), tyrosine-protein kinase (JAK2, DC = 64), tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11, DC = 58), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PIK3R1, DC = 58), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9, DC = 54), and estrogen receptor (ESR1, DC = 54). The top 10 targets are shown in Fig.1C.

To elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of BL against ESCC, we constructed an integrated compound-target-pathway network (Fig.2) that systematically links bioactive compounds (green hexagons), target proteins (light red circles), associated pathways (pink quadrangles), BL (dark blue V-shapes), and ESCC pathology (yellow hexagons). This network visualization demonstrates BL’s comprehensive pharmacological profile, with topology analysis identifying pivotal pathways that orchestrate anti-ESCC activity through compound-target interplay.

GO analysis (Fig.3A, B) showed significant enrichment in three categories: (1) Biological processes (BP): 2691 terms (i.e. protein phosphorylation, and regulation of phosphorylation); (2) Molecular functions (MF): 322 terms (i.e. protein kinase activity, phosphotransferase activity, and histone kinase activity); (3) Cellular components (CC): 134 terms (i.e. membrane structures, synaptic regions, and lysosomal compartments). The KEGG pathway analysis revealed 192 significantly enriched pathways (Fig.3C), with cancer-associated pathways demonstrating the strongest enrichment. The “Pathways in cancer” exhibited both the highest target count and statistical significance (-log10(P) value), followed by PI3K-Akt signaling, Ras signaling, microRNA regulation in cancer, and reactive oxygen species-mediated carcinogenesis (Fig.3D). These findings collectively underscore the multi-faceted mechanisms through which BL may exert its anti-ESCC effects, spanning from molecular-level regulatory activities to cancer-related signaling pathways.

Figure4presents the binding scores from the docking analysis, where lower values indicate stronger binding affinity. Heat map presents the molecular interactions between MMP9 and the three most potent BL compounds identified through docking studies. The benzofuran derivative (2E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6,7-dihydroxy-benzofuran-3-one exhibited the strongest binding affinity (− 10.4 kcal/mol), followed by the flavonoids luteolin (− 10.1 kcal/mol) and okanin (− 9.7 kcal/mol). These three compounds demonstrate significant potential as candidates for further investigation due to their low binding energies with MMP9.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) inGSE161533were analyzed using R programming language. Comparative screening between ESCC and normal tissues identified 7351 DEGs, including 3948 up-regulated and 3403 down-regulated genes, visualized in a heatmap (Fig.5A) and volcano plot (Fig.5B). Further analysis of GEO esophageal samples revealed mRNA expression patterns of MMP9. Notably, MMP9 exhibited significantly higher expression in ESCC tissues compared to normal controls (Fig.5C), a finding further corroborated in TCGA datasets (Fig.5D).

Structural characterization revealed distinct binding patterns: (i) Luteolin formed a hydrogen bond network with LEU188, ALA189, and GLU227 in the MMP9 active site (Fig.6A) ; (ii) Okanin established additional interactions with MET247 while maintaining contacts with GLU227, ALA189, and LEU188 (Fig.6B); and (iii) (2E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6,7-dihydroxy-benzofuran-3-one extended its binding to include LEU243, ALA242, and TYR245 while preserving interactions with LEU188 and ALA189 (Fig.6C).

Quantum chemical analysis of the three investigated compounds (Luteolin, Okanin, and (2E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6,7-dihydroxy-benzofuran-3-one) revealed distinct electronic configurations in their frontier molecular orbitals, as evidenced by their HOMO-LUMO energy gaps (ΔE = 2.41 eV, Fig.7A.89 eV, Fig.7B; and 2.93 eV, Fig.7C; respectively). Notably, Luteolin and Okanin exhibited the narrower energy gap, indicating superior electronic delocalization and chemical reactivity.

Based on the results of quantum calculations, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MMP9 with Luteolin or Okanin complex (The MD results for MMP9 with the positive control ligand are presented in Figure S1–Figure S4), Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) revealed that both MMP9-Luteolin and MMP9-Okanin complexes exhibit strong binding stability, albeit with distinct kinetic profiles. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis showed that while Okanin (Fig.8F) reached equilibrium within 10 ns, maintaining stable fluctuations thereafter, Luteolin (Fig.8A) required a longer equilibration period (~ 60 ns) before stabilizing. Notably, the MMP9 backbone in both complexes achieved structural stability within 10 ns. Both systems demonstrated excellent structural compactness, with radius of gyration (RG) values consistently maintained at ~ 1.50 Å (Okanin; Fig.8G) and 1.50–1.52 Å (Luteolin; Fig.8B), indicating no significant protein unfolding. Residue-level analysis (RMSF) (Fig.8C and H) revealed similar flexibility patterns, with most residues exhibiting minimal fluctuations (< 0.1 Å) in both complexes, except for select functional residues involved in ligand binding. Energetically, both complexes (Fig.8D and I) showed strong and stable binding, with comparable free energy values with nearly − 200 kJ/mol. Hydrogen bond analysis indicated that while Okanin (Fig.8J) formed 2–4 stable bonds after 10 ns, Luteolin (Fig.8E) achieved similar stability after 60 ns. Both flavonoid complexes showed strong stability with MMP9. Although Okanin bound faster, its final affinity was similar to Luteolin. The consistent hydrogen bonding patterns (2–4 bonds) in both systems underscore their potential as stable therapeutic interactions targeting MMP9 in ESCC treatment.

After treating TE-13 and KYSE-510 cells with different concentrations of Luteolin (10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 µM) for 24 h and 48 h, the CCK-8 assay revealed that Luteolin suppressed cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.9A). The wound healing assay (Fig.9B) and Transwell assay (Fig.9C) demonstrated that, compared with the control group, the migration rate and number of invading cells were significantly reduced in the 10 µM and 20 µM Luteolin-treated groups. As shown in Fig.9D, TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ESCC cells. When co-treated with 10 µM luteolin, Western blot analysis indicated altered expression levels of EMT-related proteins. Compared with the control group, TGF-β1 induction upregulated the expression of mesenchymal markers (Snail, MMP9, and N-cadherin), whereas which could be downregulated by co-treatment of Luteolin and TGF-β1.

Some studies have highlighted the potential of BL as a promising candidate for cancer therapy, particularly due to its antiproliferative, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory properties [13,15,16]. BL-derived compounds (e.g., polyacetylenes, flavonoids and terpenes) show selective cytotoxicity in multiple cancers. These include liver, lung, breast, and oral cancers [8,9,11,17]. For instance, a petroleum ether extract enriched with triterpenes suppressed A549 xenograft growth in mice by upregulating pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3 while downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, indicating mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis [9]. Recent studies have demonstrated that okanin in BL exhibits remarkable anticancer potential against oral cancer by concurrently inducing both apoptosis and pyroptosis. The compound’s efficacy in suppressing tumor growth in vivo further substantiates its promise as a novel therapeutic approach [17]. Similarly, supercritical fluid (SCF) extracts of BL reduced tumor volume and ascites fluid in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) models, comparable to conventional chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin [8]. Notably, cytopiloyne (Cp), a polyacetylenic glucoside, induced dose-dependent apoptosis in Jurkat leukemic cells by modulating mitochondrial membrane potential and proteomic profiles linked to energy metabolism and redox regulation [18]. Furthermore, Cp reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) infiltration in breast cancer models, suggesting its potential to reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments [19].

BL, a traditional Chinese medicine, exerts therapeutic effects by targeting multiple biological pathways, including the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, demonstrating promising potential for chemo-immunotherapy applications. While conventional therapies face limitations such as toxicity and resistance, BL extracts demonstrate low cytotoxicity to normal immune cells, underscoring their selectivity and safety [8,9] However, further studies are needed to elucidate the synergy between BL components and existing therapies, as well as their impact on tumor-associated antigen presentation and danger signal release.

In cancer target prediction, the integration of network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular orbital analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations provides a robust framework for identifying therapeutic targets and elucidating mechanisms. Network pharmacology leverages multi-omics databases (e.g., GeneCards, STRING) to map “drug-target-pathway” networks, enabling systematic identification of synergistic targets. For example, in gastric cancer, halociline, a marine-derived compound, was found to target mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), MMP9, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) through cancer-related pathways, validated via network analysis and molecular docking with binding energies ranging from − 20.28 to -27.94 kcal/mol [20]. Similarly, the yellow jasmine (Jasminum humile) extract exhibited cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells (IC₅₀: 9.3 µg/mL) by disrupting EGFR signaling, as revealed by network pharmacology and molecular docking [21]. Molecular docking further quantifies ligand-receptor interactions, revealing that Gegen Qinlian Decoction components (e.g., quercetin, wogonin) exhibit high affinity for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 in Helicobacter pylori-related gastric cancer [22]. Molecular dynamics simulations refine binding stability, as demonstrated in a 100-ns simulation of halociline with MAPK1 and PIK3CA, confirming stable complexes with RMSD < 2 Å [20]. Molecular orbital analysis, though less commonly applied in oncology, complements these methods by predicting reactive sites via frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO). For instance, quantum chemical calculations on flavonoids (e.g., quercetin) highlighted electron-rich regions critical for binding AKT1 and ESR1 in prostate cancer [21]. Recent studies emphasize the synergy of these approaches: esculetin and phloretin were shown to mitigate acute kidney injury-diabetes comorbidity by targeting aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 and cyclin E1, with pathway enrichment analysis linking these to oxidative stress and apoptosis—mechanisms also relevant in tumorigenesis [23]. Collectively, these methodologies accelerate precision oncology by bridging computational predictions with experimental validation, as exemplified by halociline’s anti-gastric cancer efficacy confirmed through integrated network pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulations.

The present study systematically investigates the antitumor mechanism of BL against ESCC through an integrated computational approach, combining network pharmacology, molecular docking, quantum chemical analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations. By identifying 214 shared targets between BL-derived bioactive compounds and ESCC, we demonstrate the herb’s capacity to modulate a broad spectrum of anti-cancer processes. Key targets such as SRC, EGFR, AKT1, BCL2, and MMP9 emerged as central hubs in the protein-protein interaction network, consistent with their established roles in ESCC progression, SRC and EGFR drive tumor proliferation and metastasis through tyrosine kinase signaling [24], while AKT1 promotes cell survival via the PI3K-Akt pathway [25,26].Our previous studies have demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that paclitaxel-resistant ESCC cells exhibit activated FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and elevated expression levels of these target proteins [27]. BCL2 promotes tumor cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and is linked to reduced chemotherapy sensitivity [28], while MMP9 facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis through extracellular matrix degradation [29,30]. Our mechanistic study of BL reveals target profiles that corroborate in part with Zhao et al.‘s previous findings [12]. Their research demonstrated that active constituents of BL may attenuate hepatic fibrosis by inducing apoptosis in activated hepatic stellate cells, mediated by core targets (PIK3R1, HSP90AA1, SRC, TP53, AKT1, and RELA) and subsequent modulation of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. In contrast, our study specifically highlights luteolin and okanin, derived from BL, as potential MMP9 inhibitors contributing to its anti-ESCC effects.

Functional enrichment analysis further elucidated BL’s multi-faceted mechanisms. Gene Ontology (GO) terms were significantly enriched in phosphorylation-dependent processes, including protein kinase activity and regulation of cellular responses to hormones, aligning with the dysregulated phosphorylation dynamics observed in ESCC. Kinases such as JAK2 and PTPN11, identified as hub targets, are known to modulate survival and invasion in ESCC [31,32]. Importantly, protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation represents a core mechanism in cellular signal transduction and plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of ESCC [33–36]. For example, while NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) promotes the migration and proliferation of ESCC by stabilizing YAP1 through phosphorylation at Thr-143 [33], protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O conversely inhibits lymph node metastasis in ESCC by dephosphorylating MET [34].

The KEGG enrichment of pathways like PI3K-Akt, Ras signaling, and cancer-associated further supports BL’s ability to disrupt critical oncogenic cascades, particularly in ESCC where PI3K-Akt hyperactivation is linked to chemo resistance [37–39]. For example, Finger Protein 149 confers cisplatin resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via destabilization of PHLPP2 and activating PI3K/AKT signalling [40]. Moreover, the PI3K/AKT pathway profoundly influences disease progression and prognosis by regulating various malignant phenotypes of ESCC [41–43]. For instance, Lei et al. [41]. identified a novel circPDE5A-encoded protein, PDE5A-500aa, as a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which suppresses ESCC progression by modulating the post-translational modification of PIK3IP. Ras mutations fuel uncontrolled proliferation [44,45]. In the study conducted by Chitra Palanivel et al., it was revealed that inhibition or silencing of GSK3 significantly shortens the half-life of Ras proteins (3-fold reduction) and reduces Ras protein levels through an leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1- and proteasome-dependent mechanism, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis linked to ROS-mediated carcinogenesis and microRNA regulation in cancer, pathways implicated in ESCC oxidative stress [46] and apoptosis evasion [47]. These results collectively emphasize BL’s ability to target signaling cascades, offering a holistic therapeutic strategy.

Molecular docking studies revealed that luteolin, okanin (flavonoids) and (2E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6,7-dihydroxy-benzofuran-3-one (benzofuran derivatives) exhibit strong binding affinities to key therapeutic target of MMP9, with binding energies of -10.1, -9.7, and − 10.4 kcal/mol, differently. Structural analysis highlighted interactions with critical residues in MMP9’s catalytic domain, including GLU227, LEU188, and TYR245, these are essential for its proteolytic activity in tumor invasion and metastasis [48,49].

In the prediction of the dynamic stability of ligand-target complexes, results suggest that BL compounds may act as potent MMP9 inhibitors, a hypothesis further supported by quantum chemical calculations. The narrow HOMO-LUMO energy gaps observed for Luteolin (ΔE = 2.41 eV) and Okanin (ΔE = 2.89 eV) indicate enhanced electronic delocalization, facilitating stable charge transfer during ligand-receptor interactions. This electronic property likely contributes to their superior binding affinity, underscoring their potential as lead candidates for ESCC suppress. Molecular dynamics simulations provided critical insights into the stability of BL compound-MMP9 complexes. Over 100 ns, both MMP9-luteolin and MMP9-okanin systems exhibited robust structural stability, with RMSD values converging to equilibrium after initial adjustments. The Rg analysis confirmed minimal structural unfolding (Rg ≈ 1.50 Å), while hydrogen bond analysis revealed stable interactions (2–4 bonds) critical for sustained inhibition. Although okanin achieved equilibrium faster (~ 10 ns) compared to Luteolin (~ 60 ns), both complexes ultimately demonstrated comparable binding free energies with nearly − 200 kJ/mol.

As an active member of the MMPs family, MMP9 can degrade diverse components of the ECM in various cells, promoting the proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells and fusion between microvessels. It also serves as a critical marker protein for EMT and angiogenesis during tumorigenesis, playing a pivotal role in tumor development [50,51]. Studies have found that MMP9 overexpression can promote migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in non-small cell lung cancer cells, thereby exerting oncogenic effects [52]. Moreover, reducing MMP9 levels has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells [53], Meanwhile, MMP9 is highly expressed in primary colorectal tumors, and studies using animal models of colon cancer have demonstrated that upregulation of MMP9 is associated with distant tumor metastasis [54,55]. According to the computational results of this study, our analysis of datasets from TCGA and GEO revealed that MMP9 is significantly upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared to normal esophageal tissues. We selected luteolin, an active compound from BL, for in vitro experiments. The results demonstrated that luteolin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of TE-13 and KYSE-510 cells. Additionally, luteolin treatment led to a marked downregulation in the expression levels of EMT-related mesenchymal markers, including Snail, MMP-9, and N-cadherin, in TGF-β1-induced cells. Luteolin’s well-documented anticancer properties include suppressing HCC via AKT/MAPK inhibition [56] and modulating PI3K/AKT pathways in other cancers, consistent with our molecular docking results showing strong binding to MMP9 whose critical role in ESCC metastasis is established, being activated by PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathways [57] and tumor-associated macrophages [58]. These results further suggest that luteolin may serve as a MMP9 inhibitor, demonstrating potential anti-ESCC activity.

Collectively, these findings demonstrate that BL exerts anti-ESCC effects via multi-target synergistic mechanisms. First, leveraging network pharmacology predictions combined with database mining and in vitro validation, we identified Luteolin and Okanin—two bioactive components of BL—as potential MMP9 inhibitors. Second, through molecular docking and dynamics simulations, we developed a computational model to elucidate the underlying anti-ESCC mechanisms, providing a robust framework for future drug development and further exploration of BL’s active constituents.

While the computational predictions from this study demonstrate BL’s promising potential, the lack of experimental validation limits translational potential. Future investigations will systematically elucidate the pleiotropic mechanisms underlying BL’s anti-ESCC effects through integrated in vitro and in vivo approaches. Specifically, we will employ an innovative orthotopic xenograft model generated via renal capsule implantation of human ESCC cells, which permits longitudinal tracking of metastatic progression through non-invasive bioluminescent imaging. This experimental platform will concurrently enable comprehensive assessment of BL’s immunomodulatory capacity within the tumor microenvironment, providing critical insights into its dual antitumor and immunoregulatory functions.

This study establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding the anti-ESCC effects of BL, suggesting anti-ESCC activity via pleiotropic synergy, with Luteolin and Okanin compounds emerging as potential MMP9 inhibitors, offering therapeutic insights and drug development prospects.
