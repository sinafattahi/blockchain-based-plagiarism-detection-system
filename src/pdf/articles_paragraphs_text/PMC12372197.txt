Poor feeding practices during childhood illnesses significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in low-and middle-income countries. However, information on such practices in Africa, especially Ethiopia is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess feeding practices for sick infant and young child and associated factors among mothers or caregivers of children under 24 months of age attending public health facilities in Jimma City, 2023.

A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 20 to June 20, 2023, involving 415 participants selected through a systematic random sampling technique.Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pretested, structured questionnaire.Data entry and analysis were performed using Epidata version 4.6 and Statistical Package for Social Science version 25.0, respectively. Multivariable analysis using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was conducted to identify factors associated with feeding practices for sick children. Ap-value of < 0.05 indicated Statistical significance.

The study found that 40.20% (95% CI: 35.50, 44.98) of the participants reported good feeding practices. Factors significantly associated with good feeding practices for sick infants and young children included secondary education [AOR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.14, 5.80], college or university education [AOR = 4.25, 95% CI: 1.68, 10.71], being a housewife [AOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.26, 3.44], having infant and young child feeding counselling [AOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.06], having good knowledge of sick child feeding [AOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 2.00, 6.08], attending postnatal care visits [AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.30, 3.50], and belonging to food-secure households [AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.05].

The study revealed inadequate feeding practices for sick infants and young children. Therefore, implementing targeted solutions such as offering training programs and support networks for mothers, enhancing parental awareness, encouraging regular postnatal care visits, promoting feeding for sick infants and young children, strengthening nutritional education, and initiating food security initiatives can effectively improve feeding practices among mothers and caregivers during childhood illnesses.

Appropriate feeding practices during childhood illnesses are essential for the health and well-being of infants and young children [1,2]. Breast milk is widely recognised as an ideal, sanitary, nutrient-rich, and energy-rich food for infant and child nutrition during both health and illness [3]. However, suboptimal feeding practices can lead to undernutrition, growth faltering, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality [4,5]. In low- and middle-income countries, childhood illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever are common, and the way caregivers feed their children during these episodes can significantly impact the child’s recovery and long-term development [6].

World Health Organization (WHO) recommends specific measures to support sick child feeding, including increased fluid intake, more frequent breastfeeding, and the consumption of soft, varied, appetizing foods to meet nutrient requirements and aid recovery during illness [7]. Despite these recommendations, inadequate feeding practices during childhood illnesses are becoming a global public health concern, particularly in low and middle-income countries where there are significant policies, programs, and capacity gaps regarding infant and young child feeding counselling, and food insecurity remains a pressing issue [5,8–10].

Globally, around 2.7 million children under the age of five die each year due to childhood illnesses, with 45% of these deaths attributed to undernutrition related to poor breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices [11].The optimal sick infant and young child feeding practices in Africa is alarmingly low, ranging from 10 to 50% [12]. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, only 25% of children receive increased amounts of fluids and food during childhood illnesses [13]. A study conducted in Ethiopia revealed that only 13.5% of caregivers of children with diarrhea practiced optimal feeding [14]. Furthermore, another study indicated that approximately half of the mothers or caregivers employed inadequate feeding practices for their sick infants and young children [15,16]. Consequently, inadequate feeding practices contribute to undernutrition, which poses significant challenges to Ethiopia’s commitment to ending undernutrition in children under the age of two by 2030 [17].

Existing evidence underscores the importance of providing sick children with additional fluids, breastfeeding, and nutrient-rich foods to maintain their nutrient intake and promote faster recovery [4]. Previous studies have identified household-level factors such as low socioeconomic status [9], lack of access to infant and young child feeding counseling [18], limited exposure to information about feeding sick children [13], low educational status [19], poor knowledge of feeding sick children [20], narrow birth intervals, and inadequate dietary consumption [21] as significant factors affecting feeding practices for sick children.

In Ethiopia, substantial efforts have been made to improve feeding practices for sick infants and young children, focusing on promoting breastfeeding, optimal complementary feeding, and maintaining feeding during illness [22]. However, comprehensive information on feeding practices for all children experiencing childhood illnesses remains insufficient. Additionally, this study considers important variables that were overlooked in previous research. Therefore, this study aims to assess sick child feeding practices and associated factors among mothers or caregivers of children under 24 months of age attending public health facilities in Jimma City.

A facility-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers and caregivers of children under 24 months of age attending public health facilities in Jimma city from May 20 to June 20, 2023. Jimma is located 352 km southwest of the capital city, Addis Ababa. The population of Jimma city is 239,022 (118,993 males and 120,029 females, respectively) [23]. There are two government hospitals and four health centers in Jimma city. All mothers or caregivers with children under 24 months of age who visited the under-five clinics of public health facilities in Jimma city were included in the study. However, caregivers of sick infants and young children requiring urgent referral who arrived at a health facility within 24 h of the onset of illness were excluded from the study.

The sample size for this study was calculated using a formula for a single population proportion considering a 95% confidence level, and assumed a prevalence of 53.6% from a previous study conducted in Burayu town [18], with a margin of error of (5%), and a non-response rate of (13%); the final sample size was 432.

The sample size determination for the second objective was calculated by using the double population proportion formula using Epi Info version 7 stat calc programs and summarized in the table below (Table1).

The participants for the study were selected based on the predetermined client flow rate. The data of all sick children less than 24 months old treated for childhood illness were taken from the health facilities registration book for the last two consecutive years during the same data collection period to handle the seasonal variation of the cases and used as a baseline to allocate the study participants for each health facility. The respondents were selected using a systematic random sampling technique to ensure representativeness. The first respondent was chosen through simple random sampling using the lottery method. The value of “k” (the interval between selected respondents) was calculated as follows: k = N/n, where N represents the total population (1265) and n represents the desired sample size (432). Therefore, k = 1265/432 = 3. Moreover, to ensure the accuracy of feeding practice assessments, which are based on the frequency and quantity of a child’s feeding in the past 24 h, the minimum duration of illness before the interview was set at 24 h. Infants and young children who presented at the health facility with childhood illnesses were eligible for inclusion. Those who met the criteria were enrolled in the study, regardless of their prior medical history. The assessment focused specifically on their feeding practices during their current illness. Children who had not experienced any recent illness were excluded from the interviews. The following figure shows the schematic representation of sampling procedure (Fig.1).

The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire adapted from the relevant literature [18,23–25]. The tool contained socio-demographic and economic factors: including age of mother, marital status, family monthly income, occupation of mother, maternal educational status, family size, age of child and sex of child, maternal obstetric factors: parity, birth order, and birth interval, and health service utilization-related factors: including antenatal care services, information on breastfeeding at postnatal care, place of delivery, access to IYCF counselling. Access to sick child feeding information: included mass media exposure, knowledge of caregivers on sick child feeding-related questions, Household Food Insecurity Access related questions, and sick child feeding practices covered questions. The questionnaire was prepared in English, translated into the local language, and then back-translated into English to ensure consistency and understand ability.

Sick child: a child who is not well, has any problems, and needs health care and treatment.

Sick infant and young child feeding: refers to the routine practice of feeding a child at home during illness.

Good sick infant and young child feeding practice: was considered if the mothers or caregivers provided fluids, foods and breastfeed more than usual.However, the mothers or caregivers provided the usual amount of fluids,foods, and those who provided some what less fluids,foods and less fluids,foods than usual or who withheld feeding were considered to have poor sick infant and young child feeding practices [13,18,25].

Good knowledge of feeding sick infant and young child: was considered if mothers or caregivers answered two or more out of the three knowledge questions. However, mothers or caregivers who answered lessthan two out of the three knowledge questions were considered to have poor knowledge of feeding sick infant and young child [20,23,25].

A Food-secure household was considered if the household experienced neither of the food insecurity (Access) conditions nor just experienced worry, but rarely (1–2 times) in the previous four weeks. Households that experienced a lack of food (no access to food), conditions, or worry, sometimes (3 to 10 times) or often (above ten times) in the previous four weeks were considered food insecure [24].

A two-day training session was provided for data collectors and supervisors, covering the objectives of the study, data collection techniques, procedural guidelines, and the importance of maintaining participant confidentiality throughout the data collection process.

Before actual data collection began, the data collection tool was pretested for reliability on 5% (21 participants) of the total sample size at Nada Hospital using systematic random sampling until required sample size achieved. Based on the pretest results, necessary modifications such as clarifying questions that were difficult to understand were made. The reliability of the tool was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, which yielded a high internal consistency score of 0.97. Throughout the data collection phase, the principal investigator and supervisors conducted daily checks to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the collected data. During data cleaning, no missing values were identified. Logical checks were also applied to detect and correct any inconsistencies or errors. Finally, double data entry was performed to verify data consistency and ensure data quality.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Health with Ref.no: JUIH/IRB/381/23, an official letter of cooperation sent to the hospitals and health centers. Written informed consent was obtained from each study participant before data collection. The study was conducted through face-to-face interviews, and the respondents were not subjected to any harm as far as confidentiality was concerned.

The data were cleaned, entered into Epi-data 4.6, and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Univariate analysis was used to describe the frequency distribution of each variable. The outcome variables were coded as “1” for good practice and “0” for poor practice. Multicollinearity was checked using the variance inflation factor (VIF < 10). The bivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify candidate variables for the multivariable logistic regression analysis with ap-value ≤ 0.25. The assumption of fitness was tested by the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test (p> 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with sick children’s feeding practices. The decision was made using the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and confidence interval (CI) at the 95% confidence level. Finally, the association was considered to be statistically significant at ap-value < 0.05.

The study involved 415 mothers or caregivers child pairs, for a response rate of 96%. The mean (±SD) age of the study participants was 28.21 (± 5.99 SD). Three hundred eighty-seven (93.30%) of the respondents were married. Furthermore, 172 (41.40%) mothers or caregivers were housewives. One hundred sixty one (38.80%) children were > 12 months of age. Regarding family size, 228 respondents (54.90%) reported having a family size ranging from 4 to 6 members. Sixty-one (14.70%) of the mothers or caregivers had no formal education. One hundred seventy-three (41.70%) caregivers had a family monthly income of 24–60 USD. Two hundred sirty two (55.90%) were male. Additionally, 263 (63.40%) families reported food security (Table2).

Three hundred ninety (94%) mothers had antenatal care visits, and 297(76.20%) of them had four or more ANC visits. More than half (64.80%) of mothers did not receive counseling on feeding infants and young children. Of the respondents, 81.20% of the mothers gave birth at a health institution. Concerning breastfeeding counseling, 53.30% of mothers had postnatal care visits. Furthermore, 214 (51.60%) of the children had a birth interval of more than two years with their older siblings. 219 (52.80%) of the children were born second to fourth in birth order, while 273 (65.80%) of the mothers were multipara (Table3).

Among 415 mothers or caregivers, 167 (40.20%) reported feeding their children more than usual. One hundred fourteen (27.50%) of them maintained the same feeding amount as when the child was healthy. Additionally, 134 (32.30%) of the mothers or caregivers fed their children less than usual, indicating a decrease compared to their child’s regular healthy feeding amount (Fig.2).

Of the 415 caregivers or mothers, 243 (58.6%) had access to media. Among those with media access, 196 (47.2%) were exposed to television. However, 305 (73.5%) of the mothers or caregivers reported having no information on feeding during illness. Among those who did receive feeding information, 107 (97.3%) mentioned hearing about the increased frequency of feeding during illness. Two hundred seventy-six (66.5%) of the respondents had good knowledge of feeding practices for sick infants and young children (Table4).

Among the respondents, 276(66.5) had good knowledge of sick infant and young child feeding, while 139 (33.5%) mothers or caregivers had poor knowledge (Table5).

In the bivariable analysis, family monthly income, mother’s or caregiver’s occupation, respondent age, mothers or caregivers educational status, ANC status, number of ANC visits, place of delivery, having counselling on IYCF, information on breastfeeding during PNC, mothers or caregivers knowledge, household food security status, and exposure to media were candidate variables for multivariable analysis. However, in the multivariable analysis, only the mothers or caregivers educational status, occupation status, IYCF counselling, Knowledge, information on breastfeeding at PNC, and household food security status were significantly associated with good sick infant and young child feeding practices.

Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, compared to mothers or caregivers without formal education, the odds of good sick infant and young child feeding practices were 2.58 times and 4.25 times greater among mothers or caregivers with secondary education [AOR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.14, 5.80] and college or university education [AOR = 4.25, 95% CI: 1.68, 10.71], respectively. Housewife mothers or caregivers were 2 times more likely to practice good sick infant and young child feeding [AOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.26, 3.44] than mothers or caregivers working outside the home. The odds of practicing good sick infant and young child feeding among those with IYCF counselling were 1.80 times [AOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.06] greater than those without IYCF counselling. The odds of practicing good sick infant and young child feeding among those with good knowledge of feeding sick infants and young children were 3.47 times [AOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 2.00, 6.08] greater than among those with poor knowledge of feeding sick infants and young children. The odds of practicing good sick infant and young child feeding among those who had postnatal care visits were 2.12 times [AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.30, 3.50] greater than among those who had no information on breastfeeding at postnatal care visits. The odds of practicing good sick infant and young child feeding were 1.78 times greater for food-secure caregivers [AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.05] than for food-insecure caregivers.

The Negelkerke R-square was 0.302. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test yielded a chi-square value of 4.931 with ap-value of 0.765, while the omnibus test reported ap-value of 0.000(Table6).

This study aimed to assess feeding practices during childhood illnesses and associated factors among mothers or caregivers of children under 24 months of age at public health facilities in Jimma City. The magnitude of good feeding practices for sick infant and young children in the studied population was 40.20% (95% CI: 35.50%, 44.98%). Furthermore, the caregiver’s educational status of being in secondary school or college or above, occupation status as a housewife, access to infant and young child feeding counselling, knowledge of sick infant and young child feeding, information about breastfeeding at postnatal care visits, and food security were found to be significant factors associated with good feeding practices for sick infant and young children.

The findings of this study are consistent with previous studies conducted in Malawi (44%) [26] and Shanan Dhuggo district (40.80%) [20]. This might be due to similar cultural practices and beliefs regarding child nutrition and feeding such as, the early introduction of complementary foods, the use of specific local foods, or the avoidance of certain food items during infancy may be common across these regions, contributing to similar feeding patterns [13]. The other could be demographic characteristics such as maternal education levels, household income, family size, and the age distribution of caregivers are comparable in these settings. Lower levels of education and income are frequently associated with limited access to information on optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, which can contribute to suboptimal feeding practices being prevalent in both areas and local environmental factors, such as the availability of certain foods or health care services, leading to comparable outcomes in feeding practices.

This study’s finding is lower than that reported in studies conducted in Nellore, South India (69.94%) [19], Burayu (53.60%) [18], and Mirab Abaya district (70%) [26]. The disparity could be variation in the socioeconomic backgrounds of the populations studied. Regions like Nellore and Mirab Abaya may have differing levels of education, income, and access to health and nutrition information compared to the study area. Socioeconomic status is known to influence health-seeking behavior, awareness of proper child feeding practices, and the ability to access a diverse and nutritious diet, all of which can impact feeding practices during illness. Another important factor is the difference in inclusion criteria used across the studies. While the current study included all children with various types of childhood illnesses, some of the previous studies particularly those in Nellore and Mirab Abaya focused specifically on children suffering from diarrhea. This distinction is crucial because the nutritional and hydration needs of children with diarrhea are more acute. Children experiencing diarrhea are at high risk of dehydration, and as a result, caregivers are often more motivated to increase fluid intake, including breastfeeding and offering more liquids and light foods. Health care providers also tend to emphasize the importance of increased fluid consumption during diarrheal episodes, which may not be as strongly emphasized for other types of illnesses. Consequently, these targeted interventions and heightened caregiver response could have led to higher reported rates of fluid and food intake during illness in those studies [9].

The finding of this study is greater than the findings of studies conducted at Prava Rural Hospital in India (11.50%) [27], Sub-Saharan Africa (10.45%) [13], and East Africa (26.27%) [9], and in a study based on data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016 (13.50%) [14]. These discrepancies might be attributed to variations in maternal education levels. In Jimma City, maternal education levels are relatively higher than the national average. According to the EDHS 2016, only 4% of rural Ethiopian women had attained secondary education or higher, in contrast to 25% in urban areas like Jimma [25]. Similarly, low maternal education has consistently been a barrier to optimal child feeding practices in rural India. Data from Odisha, where Prava Rural Hospital is located, revealed that only 12.7% of rural women had completed secondary education [28], Additionally, media exposure might be contribute to these variations. Mothers in Jimma City have greater access to information channels, such as radio, mobile phones, and community campaigns, compared to their rural counterparts. The EDHS 2016 reported that 47% of urban Ethiopian mothers had regular media exposure, while only 19% of rural mothers did. This exposure has been positively associated with improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices [25]. In rural India, only 28% of women reported regular exposure to mass media related to child health, which may limit awareness and health-seeking behaviors [28]. Furthermore, differences in study settings and target populations could account for some of the variations observed. While previous studies often utilized national demographic and health survey data to generate evidence at the regional or national level, the current study specifically focused on an urban population. Cultural beliefs and attitudes toward feeding sick infants and young children may also play a role in the observed discrepancies. For example, in India, strong cultural beliefs exist regarding the restriction of certain foods during illness. During episodes of diarrhea, colds, coughs, measles, jaundice, and fever, some families may withhold food, believing that indigestion is the cause of the illness and that reducing food intake will alleviate symptoms [6,27]. Moreover, differences in finding may be influenced by the timing of the studies. Recent efforts by governmental and non-governmental organizations to promote the importance of breastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding during childhood illnesses may be contributing to improvements in child feeding practices [23].

In regard to associated factors, caregivers with secondary education and college or university education were 2.58 and 4.25 times more likely to practice good sick infant and young child feeding respectively than were those without formal education. This finding is supported by studies conducted in Nellore, South India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and East Africa [9,13,19]. This could be because caregivers who attend school are likely to be knowledgeable about child feeding and to follow proper feeding practices. In addition, educated mothers or caregivers can obtain knowledge from several sources, such as books, pamphlets, and magazines, and they are more likely to be exposed to nutrition education through mass media [29].

The study revealed that housewife caregivers were twice as likely to practice good feeding compared to mothers or caregivers working outside the home. This finding is supported by a study conducted in the southern region of Saudi Arabia [30]. This could be because housewives have the opportunity to spend more time with their sick infants and young children than those who work outside the home. As mothers or caregivers spend more time with their children, they are likely to breastfeed and feed them frequently [29]. This enables mothers or caregivers to feed their children according to World Health Organization recommendations. In contrast, the study findings in Burayu showed that working mothers were more likely to consistently feed their children than housewives [18]. The possible explanations given by the author were a difference in the level of education; working mothers strongly adhere to the provider’s counseling and care for their children during illness.

Mothers or caregivers receiving infant and young child feeding counseling were 1.80 times more likely to feed their sick infants and young children more frequently than their counterparts. This finding is consistent with a study conducted in Burayu and South Wollo [23,31]. A possible explanation is that infant and young child feeding counseling provides comprehensive information about breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices during both good health and illness. Therefore, those who receive counseling on feeding infants and young children are more likely to feed their children appropriately.

This study revealed that mothers or caregivers with good knowledge of sick infant and young child feeding were 3.47 times more likely to practice appropriate feeding than those with poor knowledge. This finding agrees with a study conducted in Shanan Dhuggo district, southern Ethiopia [20,32]. This could be attributed to the fact that knowledgeable mothers or caregivers are aware of the advantages of proper feeding during illness.

Mothers who had information on breastfeeding at postnatal care visits were 2.12 times more likely to practice good feeding than their counterparts. This finding is supported by a study done in Shanan Dhuggo district and southern Wollo [20,23]. A possible reason could be that mothers who receive adequate information and support on feeding their children during postnatal care may be better equipped to initiate and maintain breastfeeding, especially when their children suffer from illness. Breastfeeding support during postnatal care is essential to address any concerns or difficulties that can impact the feeding practices of sick infants and young children.

This study also revealed that mothers or caregivers from food-secure households were 1.78 times more likely to practice good feeding than those from food-insecure households. This finding is supported by studies carried out in Bangladesh and Indonesia [33,34]. This might be due to food-secure households have consistent access to an adequate supply of diverse and nutrient-rich foods. This enables them to meet the nutritional requirements of their sick infants and young children. Food-secure mothers are more likely to have an adequate supply of breast milk and are better able to meet their child’s breastfeeding needs, including frequent and exclusive breastfeeding during illness.

In the bivariable analysis, factors such as attending more than four antenatal care (ANC) visits and having a monthly income exceeding 60 USD were found to be statistically significant. However, these associations lost their statistical significance in the multivariable analysis. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy could be the presence of collinearity between these variables and the educational level or occupational status of the mothers or caregivers. In other words, the effect of ANC visits and income may be confounded or masked by the influence of education and occupation, which are likely to be closely related to both health-seeking behavior and socioeconomic status.

The findings of this study have significant implications for the population under investigation. More than half of the mothers or caregivers reported engaging in inadequate feeding practices. This raises concerns about the potential risks of undernutrition and even mortality among infants and young children. Moreover, the findings emphasize the necessity for interventions and programs to improve child-feeding practices within the studied population. Educational initiatives, access to counseling, and targeted support for food-insecure households can be crucial for promoting proper feeding practices and reducing the risks of undernutrition and mortality among ill infants and young children.

This study has several limitations. First, the amount of food provided at each feeding and the consistency of feeding practices following illness were not assessed. Second, the study was conducted exclusively in public health facilities, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other settings. Third, the study may have been influenced by social desirability bias. Caregivers may have overreported the amount and frequency of feeding during illness, which could misrepresent actual feeding behaviors. Additionally, when caregivers are asked about feeding practices, they may respond based on what they know rather than what they do.

To minimize this bias, interviews were conducted in a separate room to ensure privacy. However, future research should consider using indirect questioning techniques, observational validation, and extended recall periods to improve the accuracy of self-reported data. Furthermore, to generate more robust and comprehensive evidence, future studies are encouraged to adopt community-based and observational study designs and include participants from private clinics and hospitals.

The study found inadequate feeding practices for sick infants and young children. Several factors were significantly associated with good feeding practices for these children, including having secondary, college, or university education, receiving infant and young child feeding counselling, possessing good knowledge of feeding sick infants and young children, obtaining information on breastfeeding during postnatal care visits, being a housewife, and having food security. Therefore, intervention strategies such as providing educational resources tailored to different academic levels, offering training programs and support networks that could be particularly beneficial for working mothers, improving caregivers’ knowledge about appropriate feeding practices during childhood illnesses, encouraging regular postnatal care visits to promote access to infant and young child feeding counselling, and implementing support programs that ensure access to nutritious and sufficient food can enhance feeding practices during childhood illness.
