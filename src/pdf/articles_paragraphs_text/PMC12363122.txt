This study compared the predictive validity and cost-effectiveness of Cariostat and a reduced Cariogram model for caries risk screening in preschoolers, to guide community-based prevention programs.

A longitudinal study was conducted among 156 children (aged 3–4 years) recruited from two randomly selected kindergartens. Baseline assessments included oral examinations, caregiver questionnaires, and caries-risk stratification using Cariostat and the reduced Cariogram. After 12 months, follow-up examinations recorded caries incidence. Predictive performance was analyzed using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Cost-effectiveness ratios (CER) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated per correctly identified moderate-to-high-risk child.

Among 147 children completing follow-up, 50.3% developed new caries (mean dmft increment: 1.41 ± 0.21). The reduced Cariogram showed higher sensitivity (90.24% vs. 73.17%) but similar specificity (43.08% vs. 44.62%) and AUC (0.71 vs. 0.69) compared to Cariostat. The cost per correctly screened moderate-to-high-risk child was 6-fold lower for the reduced Cariogram (¥14.41 vs. ¥82.68), with a negative ICER of -278.3 favoring the reduced Cariogram.

The reduced Cariogram outperformed Cariostat in sensitivity and cost-effectiveness for community caries screening, despite modest specificity. Its lower cost and simpler implementation support use in resource-limited settings.

Early childhood caries (ECC) remains a significant global public health challenge, affecting approximately half of all children worldwide and imposing a significant economic burden [1,2]. In China, data from the Fourth National Oral Health Epidemiological Survey reveal a concerning trend: caries prevalence among children aged 3–5 years increases sharply with age, from 50.8% at age 3 to 71.9% at age 5 [3]. ECC maintains persistently high prevalence rates, emphasizing the necessity for evidence-based preventive interventions and reinforced policy measures in public health practice.

Modern caries management emphasizes risk assessment-based interventions as a cornerstone of effective prevention [4]. Evidence demonstrates that early intervention beginning in infancy, risk-stratified care approaches, and preventive-oriented healthcare systems can significantly reduce ECC prevalence [5–7]. However, implementing these strategies in community settings requires practical and cost-effective risk assessment tools to identify high-risk children and optimize resource allocation.

Various caries risk assessment tools have been developed to evaluate individual risk by integrating biological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Commonly used systems include the Cariogram, Cariostat, and the Caries-risk Assessment Tool (CAT) from the American Association of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), the caries risk assessment form proposed by the American Dental Association (ADA), and Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) [8,9].

Cariostat, a biochemical caries activity test developed in the 1980 s, has been widely used in preschool children due to its operational simplicity [10]. However, its reported performance varies considerably across studies, with sensitivity ranging from 60.7 to 87.4% and specificity from 50.2–93.4% [11–13], suggesting that these findings should be interpreted in the context of specific study populations. In contrast, Cariogram employs a more comprehensive approach by incorporating questionnaire data and clinical examination findings to assess multiple risk factors [8,14]. While the full Cariogram demonstrates excellent long-term predictive validity across diverse populations, a reduced version that omits certain laboratory tests has shown comparable diagnostic accuracy in systematic reviews, with an AUC similar to the full version (range: 0.72–0.82) [9,15,16]. The reduced version requires less data input. When applied to community-based children screening, it not only reduces costs but also shortens operational time, thereby improving participants’ comfort and cooperation.

In summary, this study hypothesizes that the reduced Cariogram exhibits comparable predictive capability to the Cariostat for preschool caries risk assessment, with probable cost-effectiveness advantages. We aim to compare their screening performance for moderate-to-high risk preschoolers and evaluate economic outcomes. The findings will provide valuable evidence to guide the selection and implementation of caries risk assessment tools in community settings such as kindergartens.

A prospective study was conducted in two randomly selected public kindergartens located in Tongzhou District, Beijing. Both Cariostat and the reduced Cariogram model were used for each child to obtain the caries risk category simultaneously. Three primary data collection methods were employed to generate Cariostat and Cariogram outputs including clinical examinations, plaque sampling, and caregiver questionnaires. The participant recruitment and baseline investigations were conducted from March to April 2022, with follow-up examinations performed 12 months later.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University (Approval No: 2021-P2-328-01) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents/guardians of the participating children after they were fully informed about the study’s purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits.

①Preschool children enrolled in nursery classes; ②Children capable of cooperating with oral health examinations and plaque sampling; ③Parents/guardians being fully informed of the study objectives, willing to take part in questionnaire surveys and children’s oral examinations, and providing signed informed consent.

The exclusion criteria included: ①Children from middle and top kindergarten classes; ②Parents/guardians refusing to provide dental information or questionnaire-related data of their children; ③Failure to complete any baseline assessment component; ④Children transferring into or out of the kindergartens during the study period.

The sample size was calculated based on the sensitivity (60.7%) and specificity (93.7%) of Cariostat reported by Xuan et al. [12], as well as the sensitivity (90%) and specificity (20%) of the low-risk group in Cariogram reported by Petersson et al. [15]. With a confidence level of 1-α = 0.95 and a permissible error of β = 0.2, PASS 15 (NCSS, LLC, 2020) was used for calculation. The required sample size was 134 for Cariostat and 110 for Cariogram, with the larger value adopted. Accounting for a 15% attrition rate during the 12-month follow-up, the total planned sample size was 157. The flow chart was shown in Fig.1. Ultimately, this study included 156 children at baseline from the two kindergartens, with 147 completing the final oral examination after a 12-month follow-up.

Clinical examinations included recording the dmft (decayed, missing, filled primary teeth), with diagnoses made according to the World Health Organization’s 5th edition Oral Health Surveys Basic Methods. Two trained and calibrated dental examiners performed the examinations under artificial light using community periodontal index probes, achieving a calibration kappa value of 0.7.

The examination protocol consisted of the following steps: First, caries experience was assessed using the dmft index. Next, plaque was disclosed using a disclosing agent, followed by plaque index recording. Plaque samples were then collected using the Cariostat kit and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h to obtain Cariostat scores. The scoring system categorized results as follows: scores 0 and 0.5 indicated low caries risk, scores 1 and 1.5 represented moderate caries risk, and scores ≥ 2 were classified as high caries risk.

The questionnaire in this study was designed to collect data required for the Cariogram model. It included sociodemographic information (child’s name, gender, date of birth, kindergarten and class, and the respondent’s relationship to the child) as well as the four Cariogram assessment components: the child’s caries-related systemic conditions, dietary content, dietary frequency, and fluoride exposure. The remaining three assessment components were obtained through clinical examinations.

The Cariogram model, originally developed by Swedish scholar Bratthall, assesses caries risk through multiple dimensions: caries experience, related systemic diseases, dietary content, dietary frequency, fluoride exposure, plaque amount, Streptococcus mutans levels, salivary flow rate, and salivary buffering capacity [17]. After two decades of updates, the current software version has incorporated “clinical judgment” as an additional parameter to these nine original factors. To simplify the assessment process, the model now requires input for only seven out of these ten items to produce the probability distribution of caries avoidance [15,22].

Questionnaire results were combined with the clinical caries status, plaque index and the examiner’s clinical judgment. The compiled data were then entered into the Cariogram 3.0 software to calculate the probability of avoiding caries. Risk stratification was defined as follows: low risk (≥ 60% probability of caries avoidance), moderate risk (40%−60%), and high risk (< 40%).

The health economic evaluation in this study was performed through cost-effectiveness analysis, with primary outcomes including the Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (CER) and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), following the guidelines of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) [18]. The total cost of caries risk assessment tools encompasses both direct costs (reagents and equipment) and indirect costs (investigator training, sampling time, questionnaire administration, data collection and analysis). For Cariostat, the reagent cost was ¥58/person (includes equipment cost amortization for large-scale implementation), and sampling and data collection time was 5 min/person. For Cariogram, the plaque disclosing agent was ¥3/person, the questionnaire preparation, administration and analysis were 20 min/person. Time cost conversion was ¥0.5/minute/person (based on local per capita income [19]).

We conducted a one-way sensitivity analysis by varying key parameters across specified ranges. Direct costs were adjusted by ± 50%, while indirect costs were varied within a ± 20% range. For effectiveness data, we used the 95% confidence interval as our variation range. This analysis evaluated the robustness of results to parameter variations.

The research team collected and managed all study data using Microsoft Excel. For our primary analysis, we evaluated caries progression by examining both the mean increase in decayed, missing, and filled teeth and caries incidence rates across different risk categories. These comparisons employed appropriate statistical tests selected based on data distribution characteristics, including both parametric and non-parametric approaches when warranted.

To assess the diagnostic performance of both risk assessment tools, we established a standardized evaluation framework. This involved applying each tool’s predefined risk classification thresholds while using new caries development observed during the 12-month follow-up period as our diagnostic reference standard. Our analysis generated conventional performance metrics, including sensitivity and specificity values, complemented by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate overall predictive accuracy.

Recognizing the potential for ceiling effects in our study population, we implemented a validated adjustment protocol to enhance risk stratification accuracy. Children exhibiting baseline caries experience exceeding China’s nationally established Significant Caries Index threshold automatically received high-risk classification, a methodological decision affecting a small but clinically meaningful proportion of our cohort while maintaining alignment with internationally recognized caries assessment criteria. All analyses were conducted using Stata 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).

The study cohort included 147 children who completed the 12-month follow-up, with a mean baseline age of 4.02 ± 0.03 years and nearly balanced sex distribution (50.3% male). Caries prevalence increased from 56.5% at baseline to 65.3% at follow-up, reflecting a 50.3% incidence rate of new caries. The mean increment of decayed teeth reached 0.78 (SD ± 0.20), while filled teeth showed an increase of 0.63 (SD ± 0.10). No tooth loss was observed during the study period (mt = 0). The mean increment of dmft was 1.41 (SD±0.21). The counts of decayed, missing, and filled teeth for each risk category is presented in Table1.

As shown in Table1, both assessment tools demonstrated statistically significant differences in dmft values across risk categories at both baseline and 12-month follow-up. Although dmft increments increased with risk levels, this trend was non-significant for Cariostat (p= 0.121) but significant for Cariogram (p= 0.016).

Similar to dmft values, Fig.2showed that new caries incidence increased significantly across ascending risk categories (p< 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Using Cariostat, the incidence rates were 29.41%, 38.81%, and 79.31% for low-, moderate-, and high-risk children, respectively. The corresponding rates for Cariogram were 16.67%, 48.39%, and53.75%. Pairwise comparisons revealed non-significant differences between medium/low-risk groups for Cariostat and medium/high-risk groups for Cariogram, while all other inter-group comparisons were statistically significant.

The diagnostic performance of both tools was evaluated by classifying low-risk assessments as negative diagnoses and moderate-to-high-risk assessments as positive diagnoses, with new caries development at 12 months as the reference standard. Cariostat demonstrated a sensitivity of 73.17% (95% CI: 62.24%−82.36%) and specificity of 44.62% (95% CI: 32.2%7-57.47%), while Cariogram showed significantly higher sensitivity at 90.24% (95% CI: 81.68%−95.69%) but comparable specificity of 43.08% (95% CI: 30.85%−55.96%).

In terms of predictive values, Cariostat yielded a positive predictive value of 62.50% (95% CI: 52.03%−72.18%) and a negative predictive value of 56.86% (95% CI: 42.25%−70.65%). Cariogram exhibited improved predictive performance with a positive predictive value of 66.67% (95% CI: 57.09%−75.33%) and a notably higher negative predictive value of 77.78% (95% CI: 60.85%−89.88%). These parameters were derived from the diagnostic contingency tables in Table2.

The overall diagnostic accuracy, quantified by the AUC, was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57–0.75) for Cariostat versus 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63–0.79) for Cariogram (p= 0.41), shown in Fig.3. Although the difference in AUC values did not reach statistical significance, Cariogram consistently demonstrated superior performance across multiple parameters.

Taking sensitivity as the effectiveness measure, Cariostat required a cost of ¥82.68 to correctly identify each medium-to-high-risk child, whereas Cariogram demonstrated substantially better economic efficiency at only ¥14.41 per case. The ICER of −278.3 indicated that Cariogram achieved better effectiveness at a lower cost, making it the dominant strategy.

To assess robustness, a one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted by adjusting various cost and effectiveness parameters within clinically plausible ranges, with the results presented in the tornado diagram (Fig.4). The diagram shows that Cariostat’s reagent costs were the most influential factor, exerting substantial bidirectional effects on the ICER. Although the sensitivity parameters of both tools also affected results, their impact was more limited and unidirectional. Crucially, across all tested scenarios, the ICER remained consistently negative, confirming the robustness of our conclusion that the reduced Cariogram is the more cost-effective option for community screening applications.

Both Cariostat and Cariogram have distinct advantages and limitations in preschool caries screening. Cariostat demonstrates a significant correlation with children’s caries prevalence, making it suitable for ECC risk screening [20]. As a mature product, it offers convenient operation, but it only assesses the acid-producing capacity of plaque and incurs higher costs. In contrast, Cariogram shows superior risk-classification consistency compared to CAT, ADA forms, or CAMBRA [21], with its reduced version being clinically practical due to minimal data needs [9].

The findings of this study indicate that both Cariostat and the reduced Cariogram enable risk stratification in preschoolers. While only Cariogram showed statistically significant dmft changes, both tools exhibited clinically meaningful increasing trends across risk levels. However, pairwise comparisons revealed limitations: Cariostat had poor differentiation between low/medium-risk groups, whereas Cariogram showed reduced discrimination between medium/high-risk groups.

Both tools demonstrate caries risk screening capability for preschool children, with sensitivity results generally consistent with previous literature [11,12,15,22]. However, both tools showed relatively low specificity, which may be attributed to confounding factors such as participants receiving fluoride applications or other caries-preventive measures during the study, potentially delaying new caries formation and increasing false-positive rates. Additionally, sampling errors in Cariostat, variations in interpretation criteria, and differences in Cariogram software versions may contribute to this outcome. Their moderate AUC values align with prior reviews [23], but overall reliability remains inadequate, and standardized risk assessment models lack robust validation [24,25].

Since the direct cost data were derived from clinical medical charges or market retail prices, centralized procurement could dramatically reduce these costs. Meanwhile, labor cost data were obtained from government-reported per capita disposable income, which may substantially underestimate actual medical personnel wages. Thus, real-world implementation may involve overestimated direct costs but underestimated personnel time costs. However, one-way sensitivity analysis showed that the ICER remained consistently negative across influencing factors, indicating that Cariogram achieves better outcomes at a lower cost. The reduced Cariogram demonstrates absolute cost-effectiveness superiority. Reversing this conclusion would require a more than 72% reduction in Cariostat’s primary costs.

This study has some limitations. Using sensitivity as the effectiveness indicator partially reflects screening utility from a health economics perspective, as existing cost-effectiveness studies of ECC prevention seldom consider risk assessment tools [26–28]. When applying screening tools in community settings to guide stratified caries prevention, special attention should be paid to the increased intervention costs caused by false-positive results. Therefore, future research should incorporate health outcome measures (such as caries-free children [29]) when evaluating additional intervention strategies.

Overall, this study provides economic evidence for selecting caries risk assessment tools in preschool community programs. The reduced Cariogram combines high sensitivity with cost-effectiveness, offering an accurate and accessible solution for primary oral healthcare. Sensitivity analysis confirmed robust results across cost variations, highlighting its value for resource-limited settings.

Both Cariostat and the reduced Cariogram demonstrate moderate predictive accuracy for caries risk assessment in preschool populations, showing higher sensitivity but lower specificity. However, the reduced Cariogram proves to be more cost-effective for community-based screening. The primary factor influencing the ICER of both tools is the reagent cost of Cariostat.
