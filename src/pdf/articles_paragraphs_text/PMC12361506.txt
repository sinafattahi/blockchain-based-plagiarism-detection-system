This paper develops an SEIR-type control model for an optimal control problem (OCP) related to rumor propagation (RP), aiming to address three control strategies designed to reduce the amount of false information and defrauders in online social networks (OSNs). We explore an OCP to analyze the behavior of uninformed individuals against false rumors, the effectiveness of filtering information propagation within OSNs, and the implementation of punitive measures against defrauders. To solve this OCP, we employ a hybrid discretization-metaheuristic approach that integrates the collocation method to transform the OCP of the RP model into a nonlinear programming (NLP) with a Botox optimizer for the NLP to detect the optimal control, state variables, and objective functional. By collecting data on RP from relevant existing literature, we can better verify the SEIR-type control model to stop RP. Numerical simulations confirm the meaningful effect of three strategies that reduce the persons’ exposure to rumors and the defrauder’s tendency to mislead individuals over OSNs in controlling and stopping the RP.

In the 20th century, the Internet was a powerful tool for communication with online social networks (OSN) such as LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google+, WhatsApp, and Instagram. These platforms facilitated the information exchange from one person to another easily and quickly (1,2). Both positive information (e.g., beliefs and points of view) and negative information (e.g., rumors) propagating in OSNs can vastly affect the social lives of individuals. Therefore, authors have presented models to study their spread dynamics (see Wen et al.3, Siddiqui and Singh4, Wang et al.5, and He et al.6). On the other hand, because of financial, political, or individual profits on OSNs, a vast amount of rumors is knowingly propagated that includes false information. Although the analysis of rumor control strategies in OSNs is a critical problem to prevent negative effects, impressive research on this topic is limited. More effective models are needed in order to get favorable solutions concerning different approaches for determining the best rumor control strategies. In addition, various researchers detected that the speed of rumor propagation (RP) on OSNs was prodigious and tended to cover many audiences. Therefore, there are various mathematical models to control the rumor propagation in OSNs.

Huo et al.7developed an optimal control problem (OCP) for the RP model with a latent period in emergency conditions to maximize positive social impacts. Optimal controls, such as science education and formal domestic coverage, were considered to transform lurkers and spreaders into stiflers. Wang and Zhao8presented a nonlinear RP mathematical model between the uninformed individuals and media reports to illustrate the influence of the awareness process on the RP. Chen et al.9considered an SEIR delayed rumor propagation model to decrease the relative density of the RP individuals and the relevant corresponding costs. El Bhih et al.10proposed an OCP to reduce the RP and aimed at describing the three control strategies to decrease the number of spreader individuals, false news, and relevant costs. Myilsamy et al.11formulated an OCP for the RP through individuals in OSNs and the person’s cognitive factor to minimize the hesitators and infected individuals. Cheng and Zhao12studied three control strategies, such as removing rumor posts, attractive science education, and immunotherapy, and developed an OCP to decrease the dispersion scale and the cost of rumor control. Myilsamy et al.13proposed an OCP for a stochastic nonlinear RP model in OSNs and calculated the basic regeneration number of the RP model for the homogeneous network.

Recent studies have investigated new approaches to controlling RP in OSNs in various environments. Luo et al.14formulated an OCP for the RP model with a time delay according to the multilingual environment and an intervention procedure to reduce the control cost. Jain et al.15studied an OCP of RP on a homogeneous OSN concerning the impact of delay on thinkers to decrease the density of rumor adopters and control cost. Xia et al.16presented an OCP with an education procedure and a forced silence method to control the RP on OSNs in multilingual environments. Li et al.17developed an OCP for the RP model based on the impact of knowledge education and the intervention process to reduce the RP and increase people’s awareness of rumor information. Ding et al.18presented an OCP of the RP model with time delay and the resource limitation of homogeneous and heterogeneous OSNs in the bilingual environment. Guo et al.19developed an OCP of the RP model that focuses on public science education participation for susceptible individuals, enhances management strategies for those affected by rumors, and improves constraints on OSNs through positive reinforcement. Wu et al.20introduced an OCP for the RP model based on the person’s repeated waiting behavior in the OSN. Consequently, optimal controls, such as state interference, information dissemination and popularity, and faster devaluation of rumors, play a key role in reducing the RP.

Our paper is an effort to have more knowledge of the RP mechanism and control the RPs on OSNs by introducing various control strategies and displaying the efficiency through a computational study. To do so, we will apply three control strategies to investigate and study their performance on the RP against defrauders. The first control scenario includes the behavior of uninformed persons against false rumor. The second control is the effectiveness of filtering information propagation within OSNs. Additionally, the third control strategy involves the implementation of punitive measures against defrauders. This research also aims to solve the OCP for the RP model by utilizing an efficient discretization-metaheuristic method. The control variables in this problem, denoted asu,v, andw, correspond to the behavior of uninformed persons against false rumor in OSNs, the effectiveness of filtering information spread within OSNs, and the conduct of punitive measures against defrauders.

Recent advancements have further extended Legendre polynomial-based spectral methods to a wide range of applications. For instance, high-accuracy spectral solutions using Legendre’s derivatives have been developed for both differential and integral equations21. A Legendre-Galerkin algorithm has been proposed for fractional boundary-value problems, including the Bagley-Torvik equation22. Additionally, spectral Legendre methods have been effectively applied to singular and nonlinear models such as the Lane-Emden and Bratu equations23, as well as fractional-order systems24. Hybrid approaches, including Legendre-Chebyshev treatments, have also been introduced to tackle mixed Volterra-Fredholm integral equations25. These studies collectively reinforce the strength and versatility of Legendre-based algorithms in solving complex dynamical systems.

In our study, the OCP is transformed into a nonlinear programming (NLP) using a collocation method (CM). Since this problem is continuous, nonlinear, and large-scale, we should use an efficient optimization algorithm that warrants low running time and high accuracy in solving NLPs. Therefore, among different optimization approaches, we select the Botox optimizer (BO) due to its reliability and effectiveness. Introduced by Hubalovska et al.26in 2024, the BO is a powerful algorithm capable of solving a wide range of optimization problems. Therefore, BO is suitable for the OCP related to the RP, given its ability to address complex problems and provide accurate solutions. The BO is a human-based metaheuristic method that originates from Botox (B) methods, where imperfections are targeted and treated for beauty enhancement.

The subsequent sections of this article are organized as follows: Section "SEIR model for RP" is dedicated to a complete description of the OCP in the RP on OSNs and formulates a mathematical model; Section "CM-BO method" proposes a hybrid CM-BO method; Section "Numerical simulations" reports the numerical simulations; and finally, Section "Conclusions and future research directions" concludes the study with future research directions.

Given that all coefficients are non-negative at the boundary of the non-negative cone in, and concerning the interior directions of the gradient fields on these boundaries, starting the system from any point inside this cone ensures that the solutions remain inside the cone continually. This ensures the positivity of all populations in the model system over time.

In relation to (1), the populationIdecreases due to the exposure to inadvertent spreaders or defrauders at a rate, and persons within the uninformed set get out at a rateu(t)I(t). The controlu(t) concentrates on the behavior of uninformed persons against false rumor, about the risks concerning spreading rumors on OSNs. These activities are considered to reduce the economic and sociological influences that such rumors can have on people’s lives. So, the controlu(t) spots act as a strategy to affect the behavior of uninformed persons, acting as a vaccine against untrue rumors and operating as a preventive action. It works by prompting persons within the uninformed class to leave at a rateu(t)I(t).

In relation to (2), the populationEdecreases due to prompt persons within the exposed set shifting to the stifled set at a ratev(t)E(t) and the set of persons is subject to the rumor in the OSN after being injudicious through communication with the rumor spreader. The secondary controlv(t) displays the efficiency of filtering information propagation within OSNs, or among classes of persons by network administrators or government officials. These measures act to reduce the dissemination rate of rumors and untrue information propagating within the society via OSNs. For instance, consider SEIR-type prediction and analysis models developing approaches to reveal the reliability of the reported pandemic casualties by the government officials28,29. In this strategy, the controlv(t) acts by disconnecting information before it is spread among the persons through OSNs, certifying that only true information is made available to the population. Thereupon, the controlv(t) aims at persons within the exposed class, persuading them to transition to the stifled class at a ratev(t)E(t). This strategy works as an activity to disconnect the spread of inadvertent, thereby reducing its influence on people.

In relation to (3), the populationdecreases due to the persons that are actively propagating incorrect information that inclines toward persons on OSNs, but they are unknowingly propagating it. Therefore, a proportion of these persons select to change into defrauders at a rate. The persons in this class () are actively propagating untrue information, which contributes to defrauding rumor spreaders over OSNs, but they are ignorantly propagating it. For malicious motives, a proportion of this class of persons select to vary into defrauders, at a rate. Thereupon, from this class there is an outflow as:. Furthermore, in relation to (3), the populationdecreases due to the persons who are actively propagating incorrect information that inclines toward persons on OSNs, but they are unknowingly propagating it. So, a proportion of these persons select to change into defrauders at a rate. A person from the exposed class (E) may change into theinadvertent spreader at a rate of. Note also that the inadvertent spreaders,, may change into defrauders,, by making contact with an intentionally fraudulent rumor spreader at a rate of(individuals/day). The inadvertent spreadershave a natural death probability and deletion rate of(persons/day). Also, the inadvertent spreaders,, may change into personsRby specifying that no more rumors will be propagated by a rate of(persons/day).

In relation to (4), the populationdecreases due to persons within the defrauder spreader class comforting their exit of this class at a rateand all the persons who are defrauders. They choose to spread the rumor on the OSN to respond to some destructive and dubious reasons. In this class, all the people are spotted as defrauders. So, they choose to spread fraudulent rumors on the OSNs to answer some malicious and suspicious motives. Thus, the government’s outgoing relation is as follows:. The third control,w(t), displays the action of punitive strategies by government officials against defrauders, involving the implementation of sanctions, penalties, or even the blocking of persons who deliberately and consciously spread fraud. For example, consider a regulatory agency that would crack down on persons who run fraudulent investment plans online by imposing penalties and legal consequences. Here, the controlw(t) acts by preventing persons from participating in scam propagation works, and as a result, it reduces the presence of defrauders among the public. This preventive strategy targets to disrupt the fraud ecosystem by quickly deleting defrauders from the loop and deterring others from participating in similar illegal work. Thereupon, the controlw(t) aims at persons within the defrauder spreader class, simplifying their shift of this class at a rate. This strategy keeps persons and channels from the negative impacts of fraudulent plans by certifying accountability and prevention for fraud propagation.

In relation to (5), the populationRincreases due to stifles,u(t)I(t),v(t)E(t), and. This class shows all the persons that chose to stop rumors will be spread on OSNs at a rate and follows the procedure at a rate.

In this section, we develop a hybrid approach involving the CM and BO to solve the OCP of rumor propagation on social networks.

The operational matrix for differentiation of Legendre wavelets plays a crucial role in solving differential equations.

In Eq. (21), the condition thatonly whenis odd originates from the parity properties of Legendre polynomials. Specifically, Legendre polynomialshave definite parity:. When computing the entries of the differentiation matrix, these involve integrals or projections related to the derivative of one Legendre polynomial against another. Due to the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials and the fact that the derivative of a Legendre polynomial of degreecan be expressed as a linear combination of polynomials of degree, non-zero inner products only occur when the involved polynomials are of opposite parity (i.e., whenis odd). This procedure ensures thatmaintains the sparsity and structured nature of the Legendre wavelet framework and that only the appropriate coupling terms between basis functions are considered in the derivative operation.

To ensure the validity of the error estimate in Eq. (22), we assume that the state variables belong to the function space, while the control functions are at least. Under this assumption, the termrepresents the-th derivative of a smooth function involved in the approximation, and its boundedness guarantees the convergence and accuracy of the truncated Legendre wavelet series.

Finally, the primary OCP in equations (1)-(5) as constraints and (39) as the objective functional is converted to an NLP with equation (41) as the cost functional and equations (34)-(38) as the constraints.

After improving the location of all BO individuals, the first repetition is done. Consequently, depending on the improved values, the BO continues the next repetition, and the phase of improving the BO individuals continues until the last repetition, with respect to relations (48)-(52). In each repetition, the minimum found answeris improved and saved. After the performance of the BO, the minimum answersaved during the repetitions is considered as the answer to the NLP. The steps of BO and its pseudocode are shown in Algorithm 1. In addition, the steps of BO implementation are introduced in a flowchart in Fig.1.

where ‘’ is the population mean in the ‘’ dimension, ‘m’ is the number of DVs, and ‘N’ is the number of individuals. Thus, relations (55) and (56) can be applied to specify the percentage of population exploitation and exploration.

In this section, we report the computational study of the OCP related to RP on OSNs using the CM and BO. For augmentations of precision to certify our simulations, the parameter values for the SEIR model are provided from34–40, where these parameter values were estimated (refer to Table1). The computational tests were executed on a 64-bit computer with an Intel Core i7 CPU at 3.3 GHz and 4 GB of RAM, and the code was written in MATLAB. Our study on fighting fraud rumors evaluates several intervention methods. We simulate several control measures to reduce internet fraud rumors. These simulations evaluate how effective each tactic is at thwarting fraud and false information. We test these solutions in different scenarios to understand rumor-spreading dynamics and determine the best ways to address this social issue.

In our implementation, the truncation levels are fixed asand, resulting in 64 basis functions based on Legendre wavelets. This resolution is found sufficient in preliminary tests to provide accurate and stable approximations of the state and control variables without incurring high computational cost.

In this section, we simulate the optimal controls,, andseparately. The plan aims to protect more people from social media frauds and inadvertent spreaders. According to Figs.2,3, and4, the number of exposed people decreased, leading to fewer defrauders and uninformed spreaders, as well as more preventive measures, although these changes occurred at varying degrees. Thus, early sensitization of network fraud rumors in susceptible people gives governments and economic structures a clearer pattern for preventing notable events that can harm society and people’s lives, compared to the two other controls, i.e., filtration and punishment.

The spread dynamics without any control and with optimal control.

In this simulation, the three optimal controls (,, and) are integrated. As can be seen in Fig.5, behavior, filtrating, and punishing fraud rumors in the population affect all compartment dynamics. The figure shows a significant decrease in defrauder spreader compartmentand a significant fall in uninformed fraud rumor spreader compartmentwithin a short time for exposed individuals. Thus, the stifle compartment (R) significantly grows over time. To sum up, the suggested combined optimal control significantly reduces fraud rumors, protecting the economy, institutions, and society from harm more effectively than when each control measure is used alone. Therefore, according to our research, stopping fraud rumors requires a combined control mechanism. Our simulations confirm the synergistic effects of combined intervention measures, revealing ways to reduce fraud rumors’ adverse effects on society and people.

The spread dynamics without any control and with combined optimal control.

The recommended methods for preventing fraud rumors have pros and cons. In the next section, we compare the cost-effectiveness of the techniques to help decision-makers choose the best.

In these equations,,, andare the optimal solutions under a specific optimal control, andE(t),, andare the system DVs when no control is applied. Table2contains a summary of the cost-effectiveness metrics for the specific cases analyzed. The numbers in this table show that the combined optimal control strategy is more cost-effective (lowestACERvalue) than each single control method for preventing fraud rumors. This evidence supports our findings even more. For the unit consistency ofTC, the units of each integrand term are as follows:,, andare dimensionless control variables (bounded between 0 and 1);,, andare population counts; andis cost per unit individual per unit time. Thus, for each term in the integral, the unit of [cost/timeindividual] = [cost/time] is integrated over time to become [cost], ensuring dimensional accuracy forTC. Concerning the unit consistency ofTA, all state variables represent people. Thus, the integrand has the units of [individuals], whileTAhas the unit of [individualtime] post-integration. Consequently, the dimensionally valid unit of [cost] / [individualtime] represents the cost per individual per unit time averted due to intervention.

Theoretical Error Bound: We explicitly estimate error with an analytical Legendre wavelet-based collocation technique. Theorem 2 limits approximation error for functions into ensure convergence due to smoothness of the underlying solution. Thus, our spectral discretization accuracy is confirmed.

Truncation Parameter Justification: To get 64 wavelet basis functions, preliminary numerical studies choseand, which balanced accuracy and computational efficiency. A convergence plot is not provided, but raising these parameters beyond the chosen levels did not improve the results, proving convergence.

Comparative Simulation Results: The numerical simulations show the model’s dynamic behavior with and without control, demonstrating the optimization algorithm’s effect. This benchmark shows consistent and predicted reductions in infected classes (e.g.,) under each control scenario.

Literature-Based Model Validation: All model parameters are based on published rumor spreading research for realism and credibility. Indirect benchmarking and empirical simulation data result from this decision.

These additions should prove our hybrid CM-BO technique’s numerical accuracy and efficiency.

This study addressed an OCP for an RP model, aiming to determine an optimal solution that contributed to finding valid strategies for stopping the RP. The OCP was converted into an NLP using a CM, and BO was employed to solve the NLP, detecting the control variables associated with the behavior of uninformed individuals against false rumors, the capability of filtering information propagation on OSNs, and the implementation of punitive measures by government officials against defrauders. The computational study demonstrated that optimal control strategies significantly reduce the dissemination rate of rumors, false information, and the presence of defrauders and uninformed spreaders within the population on OSNs.

Online social media rumor diffusion is affected by several uncertainty factors. Internal uncertainties come from complex user behavior, inadequate data, or unobserved variables, while external uncertainties come from rapid public mood shifts, platform policy changes, or third-party actions. This study used deterministic parameters to demonstrate the collocation approach and the Botox optimizer, so unknown numbers and structures of uncertainty in real-time implementations may limit the robustness of our control strategy. This constraint may be overcome by uncertainty-aware frameworks like robust or stochastic optimal control. Fuzzy model-based methods also work well with real-world data and human decision-making’s imprecision. Thus, as a future direction, this research could be expanded and applied to uncertain dynamic and large-scale OSNs by adding fuzzy modeling to our optimal control framework.

In the future, the proposed discretization-metaheuristic approach can also be used for the various OCPs to obtain the optimal solution with satisfactory precision; one needs just to modify the basis function or collocation points. Also, extending this study by considering various metaheuristic approaches for solving the OCPs of RP is a valuable contribution to future research.
