In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation of senile plaques composed of neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ) is known to be one of the causes. Shati/Nat8l, a gene related to neuropsychiatric disorders, encodes an enzyme that biosynthesizesN‐acetyl aspartate (NAA) from aspartate and acetyl CoA. Studies on AD patients and model mice show that NAA and Shati/Nat8l are associated with AD pathology. We previously demonstrated that hippocampal overexpression of Shati/Nat8l in 5xFAD mice, an AD model, improved cognitive suppress without altering the number or size of Aβ plaques. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of Shati/Nat8l on Aβ neurotoxicity, we constructed a vector containing the full‐length Shati/Nat8l sequence and transfected it into Neuro‐2a cells to produce a stably Shati/Nat8l‐overexpressing cell line (N2A‐Shati). N2A‐Shati cells expressed threefold higher Shati/Nat8l mRNA levels compared with a control cell line (N2A‐Control). Treatment with Aβ for 48 h reduced the viability of N2A‐Shati and N2A‐Control cells at concentrations ≧ 0.03 μM compared to their own vehicle. Exposure to 0.03 μM Aβ for 24 h did not induce any detectable changes in mitochondrial mass or mitochondrial membrane potential in either N2A‐Control or N2A‐Shati cells. However, N2A‐Shati cells demonstrated reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (Pdk1) mRNA expression and enhanced nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) mRNA expression levels. These results suggest that, although Shati/Nat8l does not significantly affect cell viability, mitochondrial mass, or membrane potential, it could modulate specific intracellular pathways.

Full length of Shati/Nat8l cDNA vector was produced; and investigated the effects of Shati/Nat8l against amyloid toxicity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease mainly afflicting the elderly, accounts for the largest proportion of all types of dementia. The core symptom of AD is cognitive decline, while characteristic pathological findings include the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, regions critical for multiple cognitive functions. In addition, AD patients exhibit focal neurodegeneration, but senile plaque accumulation precedes neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration [1]. Senile plaques in the brains of AD patients are composed primarily of the neurotoxic protein amyloid‐β (Aβ), which is produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β‐secretase and γ‐secretase. Aggregates and oligomers of Aβ are known to exhibit neurotoxicity and synaptic toxicity. Mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism deficits have been implicated in AD. AD patients and AD model mice have well‐documented abnormal mitochondrial morphology and excessive free radical production, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2,3,4,5,6].

Anti‐Aβ antibody drugssuch as lecanemab and donanemab were recently approved in Japan, the USA, China, and Germany for AD treatment. However, while these drugs can moderate AD progression, they do not allow recovery from AD; serious side effects on cerebral blood vessels have been reported [7,8]. Besides, their new treatments' adaptation is so limited that effective target molecules and therapeutic strategies are sorely needed [9].

Shati/Nat8l was initially identified as a molecule with increased expression in the nucleus accumbens of mice injected with methamphetamine [10]. The molecule is present in neurons and biosynthesizesN‐acetyl aspartate (NAA) from aspartate and acetyl CoA [11]. We reported that Shati/Nat8l contributes to drug dependence as well as various other neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive functions. For instance, it was reported that overexpression of Shati/Nat8l, with adeno‐associated virus containing the part of Shati/Nat8l DNA, in the dorsal striatum of mice enhanced depression like symptoms [12] and that hippocampus‐specific knockdown of Shati/Nat8l in mice reduces long‐term potentiation (LTP), with impairment of learning memory [13]. Hippocampal Shati/Nat8l plays a crucial role in cognitive, learning, and memory functions, and hippocampus‐specific overexpression of Shati/Nat8l in mice is known to cause improvement of cognitive function [14]. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H‐MRS) has further revealed reduced NAA levels in the hippocampus of AD patients [15], while studies of AD model mice have found reduced NAA levels in the hippocampus concomitant with lowerShati/Nat8lmRNA expression in the hippocampal CA1 region [16], suggesting that deficient Shati/Nat8l activity may contribute to the cognitive dysfunction observed in AD. Consistent with this notion, local overexpression of Shati/Nat8l in the hippocampus of AD model mice such as 5xFAD mice was reported to enhance expression of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor at the mRNA level and mitigate cognitive decline [17].

Studies on AD patients and mice models point out an association between Shati/Nat8l and AD. These findings suggest that increased Shati/Nat8l expression in the hippocampus could be a viable therapeutic strategy. However, the cellular mechanisms linking Shati/Nat8l downregulation to cognitive dysfunction in AD remain unclear. Shati/Nat8l could improve the neuronal dysfunction in AD and be an effective intervention for AD pathology as well as the associated cognitive and memory impairments. Further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanisms of Shati/Nat8l in AD. It is necessary to perform full‐length cloning of Shati/Nat8l to advance the research.

In this study, Shati/Nat8l sequence, which is difficult to clone because of GC‐rich and repetitive sequences, was completed as Shati/Nat8l full‐length vector by InFusion cloning. To reveal the cellular mechanisms of Shati/Nat8l, it was transfected into cultured Neuro‐2a cells. We established stable cell lines expressing Shati/Nat8l and exposed them to Aβ to investigate its protective effects against Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity and its physiological functions.

Neuro‐2a cells (mouse neuroblastoma, RCB2639) were provided by RIKEN (Ibaraki, Japan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (D‐MEM) (Low Glucose) (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma‐Aldrich, Missouri, USA; 173012) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) medium and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2.

pIRES2 DsRed‐Express2 Vector (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) was purchased and used. The DNA database is available athttps://takarabio.com/resourcedocument/x33746. The cloning project was approved by the DNA Genetic Recombination Committee of the University of Toyama (G2020PHA‐7).

The primers used for vector cloning are listed with sequences in Table1.

Primers used for amplification of each target sequence.

Reverse transcription products of RNA extracted from C57BL/6J mice brains and plasmid vectors were used as templates. Mapping of the primers and fragments used to generate the complete Shati/Nat8l sequence is described in Figure1. Each target sequence was amplified by PCR using the indicated primers (Table1) and PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase, PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase, or PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.), selected according to target sequence characteristics.

PCR conditions for the amplification of each target.

The PCR products were electrophoresed on 0.5% or 1.0% agarose gels if < 2 kb, 0.5% or 0.8% gels if 2–9.5 kb, or 0.45% gels if ≥ 9.5 kb. The PCR product bands were cut out with a scalpel and extracted from the gel using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, the Netherlands; 28706). Briefly, extracted gel slices were added to three volumes of Buffer QG and incubated at 50°C until completely dissolved (10 min), and an equal volume of isopropanol was added and mixed. A QIAquick spin column was placed in a 2‐mL collection tube, and the dissolved gel sample was applied, followed by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 1 min. The filtrate was discarded, and 500 μL of Buffer QG was added to the column, followed by centrifugation for 1 min. The filtrate was again discarded, and 750 μL of Buffer PE was added to the column, followed again by centrifugation for 1 min. After removing the filtrate, the remaining Buffer PE was completely eliminated from the column by centrifuging for 1 min. Finally, the column was placed in another 1.5‐mL microtube, and 50 μL of Buffer EB was added and centrifuged for 1 min to extract the DNA.

The isolated DNAs were then inserted into the recipient vector using the In‐Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio Inc.). Linearized recipient vector (50–100 ng), insert DNA (50–100 ng in total), and 2 μL of 5× InFusion HD Enzyme Premix were combined and diluted to 10 μL by adding MilliQ water. The mixture was incubated at 50°C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and then used to transform competentEscherichia Coli. The nucleotide sequences of the double‐stranded DNA fragments used for InFusion cloning (Table3) were purchased from Azenta Life Sciences (Massachusetts, USA).

Double‐stranded DNA sequences for InFusion cloning.

A 2.5‐μL volume of InFusion reaction solution was added to 50 μL of competentE. colicells and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were heat shocked at 42°C for 45 s and immediately returned to ice for 2 min. A 500‐μL volume of super optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC) medium was added, and the suspension was shaken at 37°C for 1 h. Lysogeny broth (LB) plates were prepared by mixing Difco LB Broth (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) and Bacto Agar (Becton Dickinson) and autoclaved (121°C, 20 min). TheE. colisuspension was applied to the LB plates and incubated at 37°C for approximately 16 h. A single colony from the LB plate was transferred into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 6 mL of LB medium and incubated at 37°C for approximately 16 h with shaking.

Vector was extracted from thisE. coliusing NucleoSpin Plasmid EasyPure (Macherey‐Nakgel‐NAGEL, Dueren, Germany). Additionally, Maxiprep was performed using Genopure Plasmid Maxi Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland); the vector was collected. Finally, the plasmid DNA was dissolved in TE Buffer.

The primers shown in Table4were used in addition to several primers in Table1for sequence analysis to confirm the successful construction of the Shati/Nat8l vector and control vector. BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts, USA) and Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) were used.

Neuro‐2a cells (p= 8) were grown for 2 or 3 days until 70%–80% confluent. The cells were preincubated with 550 μL of medium in one well and 1 mL of medium in another well of a 6‐well plate. Cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and centrifuged (1.0 × 106cells per sample) at 100 g for 6 min. An 82‐μL volume of Nucleofector Solution and 18 μL of Supplement of the SF cell line 4D‐Nucleofector X Kit L (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland; V4XC‐2024) were mixed with 2 μg of Shati/Nat8l or control vector. Isolated cells were suspended in this mixture and immediately dispensed into a 100 μL cuvette avoiding the formation of air bubbles. Electric pulses (Pulse: DS‐137) were applied using the 4D‐Nucleofector X Unit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland; AAF‐1003X) for electroporation. A 500‐μL volume of preincubated medium was added to the cuvette, and this suspension was added to the well containing 1 mL of medium.

Cells expressing Shati/Nat8l or control vector were selected by neomycin resistance using G‐418 sulfate (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation). Briefly, 24 h after electroporation, the medium was replaced with the normal medium, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h, followed by seeding in 96‐well plates at 100 cells/well. After another 24 h, G‐418 sulfate was added to the medium at 0.6 mg/mL, and the cells were cultured for 12 days with medium exchange every 2 days. The cells were reseeded in 96‐well plates at 0.75 cells/well, and G‐418 sulfate was added to the medium at 0.6 mg/mL after 36 h. Scale‐up was performed after about 10 days in culture. The medium was changed every 2 days thereafter to maintain G‐418 sulfate selection.

Stably expressing cell lines were collected and total RNA extracted using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan); real time RT‐PCR was performed as previously described [17] using the primers shown in Table5. The housekeeping gene, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (36B4) was utilized as an internal standard.

The Aβ exposure protocol was based on previous reports [18]. Briefly, human Aβ1‐42(PEPTIDE INSTITUTE, INC., Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in 0.2% ammonia water to a concentration of 100 μM and incubated on ice for 30 min. This solution was then diluted to the targeted concentration (0.01–10 μM) and added to the culture medium. The cells were exposed to Aβ at 37°C for 24 or 48 h.

Cell viability following Aβ exposure was measured by MTT assay as previously described [18]. Following Aβ exposure, 0.5 mg/mL 3‐(4,5‐dimethyl‐2‐thiazolyl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was added to the culture wells at 37°C for 1 h. The formazan dye produced by viable cells was dissolved in isopropanol, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm on a microplate reader.

The mitochondrial mass was assessed using MitoBright LT Green (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). The mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated using a commercial staining kit (MT‐1 MitoMP Detection Kit) following the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo Laboratories). Cells were cultured in glass bottom dishes (Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd., Osaka, Japan; D141410) and exposed to 0.03 μM Aβ for 24 h. Another 24 h later, cells were stained with MT‐1, MitoBright LT Green, and Hoechst 33342 solution (Dojindo Laboratories) (for nuclear counterstaining) at 37°C for 30 min, washed twice with Hanks' Balance Salt Solution (HBSS) (Gibco, Massachusetts, USA), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, washed, and examined under LSM780 (ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany). The red and green fluorescence intensities, derived from MT‐1 and MitoBright LT Green respectively, were measured in stained cells (5 images per group) and the average intensity per image was calculated using ImageJ software. Cells with severely altered morphology, such as disrupted shape or damaged membrane structure, were visually identified and excluded from the analysis. The images used for analysis have been compiled in FigureS1. FigureS2illustrates the ImageJ software‐based analysis. In FigureS2, the upper left panel shows the red channel, the upper right shows the green channel, the lower left displays the regions of interest (ROIs) for individual cells, and the lower right presents the merged image.

All results are expressed as mean ± standard error. Two group means were compared by independent samples Student'st‐test and three or more group means by one‐way ANOVA. The mean mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential were compared using two‐way ANOVA. The Bonferroni correction was applied to all multiple comparisons following ANOVA.p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 9 (GraphPad Software, California, USA).

For construction of Shati/Nat8l and control vectors, PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase was first used to remove the IRES‐DsRed sequence from pIRES2 DsRed‐Express2 Vector (Figure2A), yielding the Control vector. For construction of the Shati/Nat8l vector, a part of the Shati/Nat8l full‐length sequence was first divided into six subsequences and amplified (Figure1), followed by InFusion cloning to incorporate the partial sequences and the terminal DNA fragments into the Control vector (Figure2B). The vector constructions were confirmed by sequencing with primers to the target sequences.

Both vectors were transfected into Neuro‐2a cells and cells with stable expression selected by 0.6 mg/mL G‐418 sulfate. (C) Relative expression levels of Shati/Nat8l mRNA in stable cell lines compared with the control cell line (N2A‐Control). The Shati/Nat8l‐overexpressing cell line (N2A‐Shati) demonstrated approximately threefold higher Shati/Nat8l mRNA levels. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n= 4 per group). Statistical significance was assessed by Student'st‐test (N2A‐Control vs. N2A‐Shati,p< 0.0001). ****p< 0.0001.

Control and Shati/Nat8l vectors were transfected into Neuro‐2a cells by electroporation, and each stable cell line was established by G‐418 sulfate selection. The mRNA levels of neomycin resistance genes were compared by real time RT‐PCR. Cell lines with no difference in their mRNA levels were selected for the experiments. The selected Shati/Nat8l‐overexpressing cell line (N2A‐Shati) demonstrated about threefold higher expression of Shati/Nat8l mRNA than the control (N2A‐Control) (Figure2C).

To evaluate Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity against each cell line, 0.02% ammonia water (vehicle) or Aβ (0.01–10 μM) was added to cultures for 48 h, and remaining viable cells were estimated by the MTT assay (Figure3A). N2A‐Shati and N2A‐Control cells showed reduced viability at Aβ concentrations above 0.03 μM compared to their own vehicle (Figure3B). At a concentration of 10 μM Aβ, the mean cell viability was 60.69% in N2A‐Control cells and 66.12% in N2A‐Shati cells.

For the comparison of N2A‐Control vehicle and different Aβ concentrations,F(7, 136) = 41.04. For the comparison of N2A‐Shati vehicle and different Aβ concentrations,F(7, 136) = 23.32.

The mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potentials of both cell lines were compared after treatment with Aβ (0.03 μM, for 24 h) at the concentration that did not reduce cell viability (Figure4A). Exposure to Aβ did not induce significant alterations in mitochondrial mass or mitochondrial membrane potential in either N2A‐Control or N2A‐Shati cells. Furthermore, no detectable differences were observed between the two cell lines (Figure4B,C). All raw images used for the analysis are included in FigureS1, and the corresponding ImageJ analysis is shown in FigureS2.

Overexpression of Shati/Nat8l had no effect on mitochondrial mass or mitochondrial membrane potential. (A) Stable cell lines were plated on glass bottom dishes and stained with nuclear (Hoechst 33342; blue), mitochondria (MitoBright LT Green; green), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MT‐1, red) for fluorometric evaluation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Scale bars are 10 μm. (B, C) Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential remained unchanged between N2A‐Control and N2A‐Shati cells, regardless of Aβ treatment. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n= 5 images per group). Statistical significance was assessed by two‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. In mitochondrial mass, adjustedp‐values for the following comparisons are: N2A‐Control (vehicle) vs. N2A‐Control (Aβ) (adjustedp> 0.9999), N2A‐Shati (vehicle) vs. N2A‐Shati (Aβ) (adjustedp> 0.9999), N2A‐Control (vehicle) vs. N2A‐Shati (vehicle) (adjustedp> 0.9999), N2A‐Control (Aβ) vs. N2A‐Shati (Aβ) (adjustedp= 0.2738). For the main effect of cell lines,F(1, 16) = 2.669,p= 0.1219. For the main effect of Aβ treatment,F(1, 16) = 0.3188,p= 0.5801. For the interaction between cell lines and Aβ treatment,F(1, 16) = 2.050,p= 0.1715. In mitochondrial membrane potential, adjustedp‐values for the following comparisons are: N2A‐Control (vehicle) vs. N2A‐Control (Aβ) (adjustedp> 0.9999), N2A‐Shati (vehicle) vs. N2A‐Shati (Aβ) (adjustedp> 0.9999), N2A‐Control (vehicle) vs. N2A‐Shati (vehicle) (adjustedp> 0.9999), N2A‐Control (Aβ) vs. N2A‐Shati (Aβ) (adjustedp= 0.3451). For the main effect of cell lines,F(1, 16) = 3.192,p= 0.0930. For the main effect of Aβ treatment,F(1, 16) = 0.5884,p= 0.4542. For the interaction between cell lines and Aβ treatment,F(1, 16) = 1.227,p= 0.2845.

When the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function was examined, Pdk1 mRNA expression was decreased (Figure5A), whereas Nrf1 and Tfam mRNA expression was increased (Figure5B,C) in N2A‐Shati cells compared with N2A‐Control cells.

Overexpression of Shati/Nat8l altered the mRNA expression levels of mitochondria‐related genes. Expression of Pdk1 mRNA was lower (A), while expression levels of Nrf1 mRNA (B) and Tfam mRNA (C) were higher in N2A‐Shati cells compared with N2A‐Control cells. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. For Pdk1 and Nrf1,n= 6 for both N2A‐Control and N2A‐Shati groups. For Tfam,n= 4 for N2A‐Control andn= 3 for N2A‐Shati. Statistical significance was assessed by Student'st‐test.p= 0.0079 for pdk1,p= 0.0001 for Nrf1,p= 0.0002 for Tfam. **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001.

In this study, we first produced a vector containing the full‐length sequence of Shati/Nat8l and subsequently established cell lines stably overexpressing Shati/Nat8l to investigate whether this gene can confer resistance against AD‐like pathology. Concentrations of Aβ above 0.03 μM reduced the cell viability of control and Shati/Nat8l‐overexpressing cell lines. Moreover, Shati/Nat8l‐overexpression had no observable effect on mitochondrial mass or mitochondrial membrane potential, irrespective of the presence or absence of Aβ exposure.

Shati/Nat8l is associated with the metabolism of NAD+ by consuming acetyl CoA derived from the TCA cycle and handling aspartate through malate–aspartate shuttles to synthesize NAA [16]. These phenomena suggest that NAA production is closely linked to ATP synthesis, so Shati/Nat8l is reported to increase ATP content [19]. The transition of pyruvate to acetyl CoA is facilitated by PDH, while PDH activity is suppressed by upstream PDK [20]. The Pdk1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in neurons [21], but expression was reduced by Shati/Nat8l overexpression, suggesting disinhibition of PDH, activation of the TCA cycle, and greater ATP production. Mitochondrial DNA encodes subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complex, which enhances neural function via ATP production [22] and the transcription is activated by genes such as Nrf1 and Tfam [23]. At the same time, mitochondrial DNA content is diminished in the brains of AD patients [24]. Shati/Nat8l is involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain [16]. In addition, Shati/Nat8l overexpression upregulated the expression levels of Nrf1 and Tfam, key regulators of mitochondrial functions. Thus, Shati/Nat8l could enhance acetyl CoA and ATP production by suppressing Pdk1 expression and upregulating mitochondrial DNA transcription via Nrf1 and Tfam. Although no significant effects were observed across all tested parameters, including cell viability, mitochondrial mass, and membrane potential, these effects mediated through altered gene expressions could reflect intracellular responses potentially associated with resistance to Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity. Further studies with varied Aβ exposure conditions may provide clearer insights into the potential protective effects of Shati/Nat8l against such toxicity.

Upregulation of Shati/Nat8l was reported to increase glucose uptake and mitochondrial volume in immortalized brown adipocytes [25], and we have reported that Shati/Nat8l overexpression increased ATP content and axon length of primary cultured mouse neurons [19]. However, the specific contributions of Shati/Nat8l to cellular energy production remain to be clarified. Next, we plan to evaluate ROS production, mitochondrial DNA content, acetyl CoA levels, ATP synthesis, and related cellular respiration metrics. Additionally, we will perform comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, including RNA sequencing and ChIP‐seq, to systematically investigate gene expression and regulatory changes induced by Shati/Nat8l overexpression.

There is increasing focus on the role of mitochondria in AD, and some molecules have shown promising early results; although none have led to practical applications in AD therapy [2,26]. Although the data were limited, the observed gene expression changes in this study might reflect a potential role of Shati/Nat8l in mitochondrial regulation. In the previous Shati/Nat8l studies, the quantification of Shati/Nat8l protein could not be achieved due to the lack of widely validated antibodies. The FLAG tag of the plasmid vector also made it possible to measure the expression of Shati/Nat8l protein, to elucidate the localization region of this, and to extract related proteins by the immunoprecipitation method. Nevertheless, the present findings were derived from experiments utilizing immortalized cell lines, which have inherent limitations, and were based solely on mRNA‐level analyses. In future studies, more substantive investigations employing primary cultured cells or animal models will be undertaken to obtain deeper insights. Clarifying the relationship between mitochondrial function and Shati/Nat8l may help to determine whether Shati/Nat8l is involved in neuronal dysfunction in AD and whether it could serve as a potential target for addressing AD pathology and associated cognitive and memory decline.
