Therapeutic strategies for Aneurysmal Bone Cysts (ABCs) of the spine remain controversial and encompass several modalities, including open surgery (ie, intralesional curettage and/or en bloc resection), localized injections, and pharmacotherapy. This study was designed to retrospectively analyze the clinical data from patients treated at our institution, with the objective of evaluating the clinical outcomes, safety profile, and efficacy of different treatments including open surgery, percutaneous injections of a doxycycline-albumin suspension, and Denosumab therapy in the management of these lesions, thereby establishing a basis for a comprehensive treatment algorithm.

From January 2010 to December 2024, 27 patients who had no/minor neurological deficits (modified Frankel scale D or E) were included in the study, of whom 6 were treated with open surgery (surgery group), 14 were treated with percutaneous doxycycline/albumin injection (injection group) and 7 were treated with Denosumab (Denosumab group). The demographic and clinical information of these groups were recorded and compared.

In the surgery cohort (n = 6), complete neurological recovery was achieved in 5 patients (83.3%), while 2 patients experienced residual minor paresthesia; their mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score decreased from 4.9 to 0.8. Two patients developed local recurrence over a mean follow-up period of 46.6 months (range, 15-113 months). In the injection cohort (n = 14), all patients demonstrated a significant reduction in lesion size and resumed normal daily activities. Complete symptomatic resolution was reported in 10 patients; 3 achieved partial resolution, with only mild, exertion-related local pain. Their mean VAS score decreased from 4.9 to 0.7. During a mean follow-up of 68.1 months (range, 7-117 months), no complications or recurrences were observed. In the Denosumab cohort (n = 7), all patients exhibited a significant reduction in lesion size and resumed normal activities. Complete symptomatic resolution was achieved in 7 patients, while 1 experienced partial resolution, characterized by intermittent, mild upper extremity weakness. Their mean VAS score decreased from 4.8 to 0.24. No complications or recurrences were documented over a median follow-up of 9.5 months (range, 1-88 months). No significant differences were observed among the cohorts regarding the rates of recurrence (P= 0.227) or complications (P= 0.304).

For patients presenting with spinal ABCs characterized by an absence of severe neurological deficits, both intralesional injection and systemic drug therapy are effective minimally invasive treatment options and can be considered as first-line choices. However, while both approaches demonstrate favorable short-term efficacy, their long-term outcomes require further investigation. Although not the preferred initial treatment, open surgery remains a crucial option for rapidly correcting spinal instability and reversing neurological deficits.

Due to the rarity of spinal ABCs, a standardized treatment protocol remains controversial. Although various therapeutic strategies have been reported in the literature, these studies are predominantly small-sample, single-center experiences, thus lacking high-level evidence to establish a definitive consensus on the optimal management approach. Treatment modalities for spinal ABCs encompass a range of interventions, including open surgery (ie, intralesional curettage and/or en bloc resection), intralesional injections, pharmacotherapy, selective arterial embolization (SAE), and radiotherapy.5-8Open surgery has traditionally been the mainstay of treatment for spinal ABCs; however, resection of these spinal tumors is associated with significant surgical morbidity and a risk of iatrogenic neurological injury. In addition to open surgery, our institution has explored minimally invasive therapeutic strategies, establishing percutaneous injection of a doxycycline-albumin suspension as a viable alternative therapy.9This approach is particularly suitable for patients presenting with adequate spinal stability and an absence of severe neurological deficits. Furthermore, published reports have documented the successful use of Denosumab for managing recurrent, postoperative ABCs,10prompting our own investigation and effective clinical application of this pharmacotherapeutic agent.

Given the rarity of spinal ABCs, the literature pertaining to their management is limited. As one of the largest spinal tumor centers in China, our institution has managed a substantial cohort of patients with primary spinal ABCs. This experience provides a unique opportunity to analyze treatment outcomes from a large, single-center series. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to retrospectively analyze our clinical data, evaluating the outcomes associated with various therapeutic strategies with the goal of refining the treatment algorithm for these challenging lesions.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University’s hospital (IRB00006761-M2023022) and its implementation adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who were treated for primary spinal ABCs at our institution between January 2010 and December 2024. A key inclusion criterion was a definitive diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination. Patients with extra-spinal or secondary ABCs were excluded from the study. A search of the institutional database identified a total of 27 patients who met the eligibility criteria and were subsequently included for analysis. This study was limited to a retrospective review of patients who underwent inpatient treatment. Outpatient cases were excluded from the analysis due to the potential for incomplete or inconsistent medical records, which could have compromised the integrity of the data.

Prior to 2014, open surgery represented the standard of care for all patients with spinal ABCs at our institution.9Subsequently, beginning in 2014, percutaneous injection of a doxycycline-albumin suspension was introduced as a therapeutic option. This modality was reserved for select patients presenting with an absence of severe neurological deficits (muscle strength grade >3/5), and lesions exhibiting a distinct cystic architecture.9More recently, in 2018, pharmacotherapy was incorporated into our treatment paradigm.

Our current treatment algorithm stratifies patients based on clinical and radiological findings. Open surgery is the indicated treatment for individuals presenting with spinal instability or significant neurological compromise. The surgical strategy was determined based on the anatomical location of the lesion and the anticipated surgical difficulty. Operative procedures included en bloc resection (either via an intralesional or extralesional approach) or intralesional curettage with spinal reconstruction and decompression using pedicle screw fixation. For patients with stable spines and an absence of neural compression, the therapeutic pathway is further determined by the lesion’s architecture. Those with lesions exhibiting a prominent cystic component are considered candidates for either CT-guided percutaneous injection or Denosumab therapy. Conversely, if a stable lesion is predominantly solid, pharmacotherapy with Denosumab is the preferred non-operative approach. Surgical intervention is recommended for any patient undergoing non-operative management who demonstrates treatment failure or disease progression. Finally, for all patients, written informed consent was obtained after a comprehensive discussion of the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment plan.

In the absence of established clinical guidelines for Denosumab therapy in ABCs, our treatment protocol was adapted from a multicenter case series published by the French Society of Pediatric Cancers (SFCE) and the French Sarcoma Group (GSF).12The regimen consisted of a loading phase with Denosumab administered at 70 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance phase of monthly injections at the same dosage. All patients received concurrent supplementation with calcium acetate and calcitriol (an active vitamin D analog). The total duration of therapy was individualized, guided by a composite assessment of clinical response and radiological findings at follow-up evaluations. In most cases, treatment was discontinued after approximately two years.

The standard diagnostic workup for all patients included anteroposterior and lateral spinal radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lesion volume was calculated using the ellipsoid volume formula.13For patients in whom a diagnosis was not established via an open surgical biopsy, a CT-guided core needle biopsy was performed by an interventional radiologist to obtain tissue for histopathological confirmation. Following histopathological confirmation, patients were allocated to a treatment arm: open surgery, percutaneous doxycycline-albumin injection, or Denosumab pharmacotherapy.

Post-discharge, follow-up examinations were scheduled at 3 and 6 months, and semiannually thereafter. These assessments included documentation of current symptoms, evaluation of neurological status using the Frankel grading system, VAS pain scores, and the occurrence of any treatment-related complications. Annual radiological surveillance with CT and MRI was performed to monitor for changes in lesion volume, evidence of lesion expansion, or local recurrence. Immediate CT and MRI examinations were indicated in the event of symptom recurrence. Recurrence was defined as the radiological identification on CT of new osteolytic areas or the expansion of a pre-existing lytic component that warranted further intervention.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics, version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The normality of distribution for continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while non-normally distributed (skewed) data are expressed as median and range. Intergroup comparisons of continuous variables—including age, disease duration, pre- and post-operative VAS scores (at 12 months) were conducted as follows: for normally distributed data, Student's t-test (for two groups) or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (for ≥3 groups) was used. For non-normally distributed data, the Mann-Whitney U test (for two groups) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for ≥3 groups) was employed. Differences in categorical variables, including sex, recurrence rates, and complication rates, were analyzed using the chi-square (χ2) test. Lesion location was categorized as cervical, thoracic, or lumbar, and the distribution of these locations among the different treatment groups was also compared using the χ2test. AP-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

A total of 27 patients with primary spinal ABCs were included and stratified into three treatment cohorts (Table 1). The open surgery cohort comprised 6 patients (5 male, 1 female; mean age, 20.1 years; range, 13-36 years). The percutaneous injection cohort included 14 patients (5 male, 9 female; mean age, 18.6 years; range, 4-47 years). The Denosumab pharmacotherapy cohort consisted of 7 patients (5 male, 2 female; mean age, 23.4 years; range, 11-43 years).

Baseline comparisons among the three treatment cohorts revealed no statistically significant differences in age (P= 0.622), Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) (P= 0.720), lesion location (P= 0.160), or pre-treatment Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores (P= 0.925). However, a statistically significant difference was observed among the groups regarding sex distribution (P= 0.077) and the duration of symptoms prior to treatment (P= 0.005). Post-hoc analysis indicated that the Denosumab cohort had a significantly shorter pre-treatment symptom duration compared to both the open surgery cohort (P= 0.010) and the percutaneous injection cohort (P= 0.003).

In the open surgery cohort (n = 6), lesions were located in the cervical (n = 3), thoracic (n = 1), and lumbar spine (n = 2). The mean preoperative Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) was 10.7 (range, 8-13). Of the 5 patients presenting with neurological compromise, 2 had bilateral lower extremity paresthesia, weakness, and gait instability, with one of these patients also reporting severe thoracolumbar pain and another experiencing bowel and bladder incontinence. The remaining 1 patients presented with quadriparesis and quadri-paresthesia, predominantly affecting the lower extremities. All patients were managed via a posterior surgical approach; 2 underwent en bloc resection (Figure 1), while 4 underwent intralesional curettage. The mean operative time was 221 minutes (range, 70-372 min), and the mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 929 mL (range, 200-2200 mL).

At a mean follow-up of 46.6 months (range, 15-113 months), significant clinical improvement was observed. The mean VAS score decreased from 4.9 to 0.9, and the median VAS score decreased from 5 (range, 2-9) to 0 (range, 0-3). Complete neurological recovery was achieved in 5 patients (83.3%), while 2 patients had residual minor paresthesia. Two patients (33.3%) experienced local recurrence. The first case, diagnosed 24 months postoperatively after follow-up imaging revealed an enlarging lytic lesion in L4, was confirmed by biopsy and subsequently managed conservatively with Denosumab, with no further recurrence. The second patient with recurrence underwent a repeat surgical procedure involving resection, fusion, and internal fixation. One major complication was recorded (16.6%): a fracture of an internal fixation rod occurred 36 months postoperatively, which was successfully treated with revision surgery.

In the percutaneous injection cohort (n = 14), lesions were located in the cervical (n = 5), thoracic (n = 5), and lumbar spine (n = 4). Patients presented with local pain for a mean duration of 4.8 months (range, 1-12 months), and the mean presenting Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score was 4.9 (range, 2-8). Six patients reported functional impairment, and five had neurological deficits: one patient presented with L5 radiculopathy and three with myelopathy (one with paraparesis/paresthesia and two with quadriparesis/paresthesia). Pre-treatment Frankel grades were E (n = 9), D (n = 3), and C (n = 2). The median pre-treatment lesion volume was 25.0 mL (range, 1-209 mL), and the mean preoperative Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) was 11.6 (range, 7-17). Thirteen patients were treated with the doxycycline-albumin suspension, while one received injections of calcitonin and corticosteroids. Of these, 8 patients finished a single injection, 3 finished two injections, and 3 finished three.

At a final mean follow-up of 68.1 months (range, 7-117 months), no recurrences were observed. Follow-up CT and MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in lesion volume (Figures 2and3). Functionally, all patients returned to normal activities. Complete symptomatic resolution was achieved in 10 patients (71.4%), while 3 (21.4%) reported partial resolution with only mild, exertion-related local pain. Notably, all 4 patients presenting with pre-treatment neurological deficits (Frankel grades C and D) achieved neurological recovery. The mean post-treatment VAS score decreased to 0.8, with a median of 0 (range, 0-2).

Three complications were recorded. One patient experienced transient dizziness on the day of injection, which resolved spontaneously and was attributed to a reaction to anesthesia. Another patient had a transient syncopal episode the day after injection, which resolved following intravenous fluids and administration of 5 mg of dexamethasone. One patient developed an acute neurological deficit on the day of injection, presenting with left-sided weakness and numbness below the nipple line. On examination, muscle strength was grade 4/5 in the left upper extremity and 3/5 in the left lower extremity, with lower limb hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and positive pathological reflexes. An immediate presumptive diagnosis of acute epidural hematoma with neural compression was made. Conservative management was initiated with glucocorticoids, mannitol, and tranexamic acid. The patient responded well, and at discharge on day 5, left-sided muscle strength had recovered to grade 5-, and the patient was ambulatory with significantly reduced sensory deficits. No instances of infection, skin necrosis, or vascular embolism were recorded.

In the Denosumab pharmacotherapy cohort (n = 7), lesions were predominantly located in the mobile spine, with 6 in the cervical or cervicothoracic region and 1 in the lumbar spine. Patients presented with a mean symptom duration of 1.5 months (range, 0.5-3 months) and a mean initial Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of 4.7 (range, 3-6). Two patients reported functional impairment, and three presented with neurological deficits: one with C4-5 radiculopathy and two with myelopathy (one with quadriparesis and quadri-paresthesia with associated upper extremity pain, and one with isolated upper extremity paresthesia). Pre-treatment Frankel grades were E. The mean pre-treatment lesion volume was 32.7 mL (range, 3-68 mL), and the mean SINS score was 10.9 (range, 8-15). All patients received a standardized regimen of subcutaneous Denosumab injections, with a mean of 8 administrations (range, 2-16).

At a final mean follow-up of 10.6 months (range, 1-25 months), no recurrences were documented. All patients returned to normal activities. Notably, two patients in this cohort, who had previously failed intralesional sclerotherapy, were successfully salvaged with Denosumab therapy (Figures 4and5). Complete symptomatic resolution was achieved in 6 patients (85.7%), while 1 (14.3%) experienced partial resolution, with only intermittent, mild upper extremity weakness. The mean post-treatment VAS score decreased significantly to 0.3, with a median of 0 (range, 0-2). No major complications, including neurological injury, infection, skin necrosis, or vascular embolism, were recorded in this cohort.

Comparisons of clinical outcomes among the three treatment cohorts revealed no statistically significant differences in recurrence rates (P= 0.227), complication rates (P= 0.382), or the magnitude of improvement in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores (P= 0.907).

ABCs predominantly affect individuals in the first two decades of life, with no significant sex predilection, and can involve any part of the skeleton. The natural history of an ABC is understood to progress through 4 distinct phases18: (1) The initial osteolytic phase, marked by a periosteal reaction; (2) The growth phase, characterized by progressive bone destruction; (3) The stabilization phase, where the lesion becomes well-circumscribed and expansile with a sclerotic rim and internal septations (the “typical” ABC appearance); and (4) The healing phase, defined by progressive ossification of the lesion.

The management of spinal ABCs is particularly challenging due to the intricate anatomy of the spine and the proximity of these lesions to critical neurovascular structures—a factor that significantly elevates the complexity and risk of iatrogenic injury associated with any intervention. Consequently, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the optimal treatment strategy for spinal ABCs. Therapeutic options range from open surgery (curettage or en bloc resection) and intralesional sclerotherapy (using agents such as doxycycline-albumin, calcitonin with corticosteroids, or concentrated bone marrow aspirate), to pharmacotherapy (Denosumab), selective arterial embolization (SAE), radiotherapy, or a combination of these modalities.7,19To contribute to this ongoing discussion, the present study reviews our institutional experience with 27 patients treated with one of three primary modalities—open surgery, percutaneous injection, or Denosumab—with the aim of summarizing their respective outcomes.

Consistent with previous reports, all patients in our surgical cohort experienced improved neurological function and a significant reduction in local pain. The local control rate for surgical resection is reported to be approximately 90% in large case series.21-23In our study, one patient (14.3%) in the surgery cohort developed a recurrence, whereas no recurrences were observed in the non-operative cohorts. The lack of a statistically significant difference in recurrence rates among the groups is likely attributable to the small sample size of our study. Therefore, we recommend that the choice between intralesional and en bloc resection for spinal ABCs should be guided by a preoperative assessment of the anticipated bleeding risk, rather than by the goal of achieving wide surgical margins.

Minimally invasive approaches for spinal ABCs primarily comprise selective arterial embolization (SAE) and intralesional sclerotherapy. However, not all lesions are amenable to SAE, particularly those with small-caliber feeding arteries or arteriovenous fistulas. While Boriani et al.19reported excellent outcomes with SAE in 17 cases, the majority of these lesions were located in the lumbar spine, potentially limiting the generalizability to more complex cervical or thoracic locations.

Supporting this approach, Shiels and Mayerson11reviewed 20 ABC patients treated with doxycycline-albumin, noting definitive healing responses in all cases, characterized by decreased osteolysis and cortical thickening. Similarly, a previous report from our institution on 14 patients treated with the same technique found that all lesions decreased in size and sclerosed, with no complications or recurrences at a mean follow-up of 30.7 months. The results of the present study are consistent with these favorable outcomes. Despite these positive results, intralesional sclerotherapy has recognized limitations. The multi-septated internal architecture of many ABCs can impede the uniform distribution of the sclerosing agent throughout the lesion. Furthermore, partial ossification following an initial injection may create enclosed compartments, potentially reducing the efficacy of subsequent injections.

The pathogenesis of ABCs is driven by the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway. Osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells within the lesion highly express the RANK receptor, while stromal cells secrete its ligand, RANKL. The binding of RANKL to RANK activates osteoclast-mediated osteolysis. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody, directly targets this pathway by specifically binding to and neutralizing RANKL, thereby preventing its interaction with RANK and inhibiting bone resorption.

The therapeutic application of Denosumab for ABCs was first reported by Lange et al.10in 2013 in two cases of postoperative recurrence. Our institutional regimen is adapted from the multicenter case series by Raux et al,12consisting of Denosumab at 70 mg/m2administered subcutaneously, once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by monthly maintenance injections. Concurrent calcium and vitamin D supplementation (calcium acetate and calcitriol in our series) is essential to prevent treatment-related hypocalcemia. In the present study, treatment with Denosumab resulted in significant volumetric reduction of the lesions. This radiological improvement correlated with complete pain relief, a return to normal activities, and no observed recurrences during the follow-up period. Based on our experience, we have found Denosumab to be a particularly effective salvage therapy for cases of postoperative recurrence or for lesions that demonstrate an incomplete response or progression following intralesional sclerotherapy.

Our institutional experience contributes to the evolving understanding of spinal ABC management and supports a treatment paradigm that prioritizes minimally invasive approaches. For patients presenting without severe neurological deficits or significant spinal instability, we recommend intralesional sclerotherapy with a doxycycline-albumin suspension as the first-line therapy, acknowledging that multiple injections may be required to achieve complete lesion consolidation. In cases where intralesional therapy yields an incomplete response or the lesion progresses, we advocate for systemic therapy with Denosumab as a highly effective second-line or salvage option, which has proven particularly valuable in our series for inducing significant volumetric reduction and symptomatic relief. Open surgery is not considered our primary treatment modality but remains an indispensable component of the management algorithm, reserved for patients with acute or progressive neurological compromise and significant spinal instability where rapid decompression and stabilization are paramount. Ultimately, the management of spinal ABCs necessitates a personalized approach, and while our proposed strategy has yielded favorable short-term outcomes, the long-term efficacy and potential late-onset complications of these treatments warrant continued, rigorous follow-up.

The present study is subject to several inherent limitations. First and foremost, the retrospective design and small sample size—a consequence of the rarity of spinal ABCs—introduce the potential for selection bias and confounding variables. Consequently, large-scale, multicenter, prospective studies are warranted to definitively compare the efficacy of these different therapeutic modalities and to more comprehensively characterize the radiological healing patterns associated with each.

Secondly, the follow-up duration for the Denosumab cohort is considerably shorter than that for the open surgery and percutaneous injection cohorts, a reflection of its more recent incorporation into our treatment paradigm. As recommended by Hauschild et al,29extended clinical and radiological surveillance is crucial for several years post-treatment. Therefore, continued monitoring of our Denosumab cohort for a minimum of 5 years will be essential to ascertain long-term efficacy and to definitively rule out late recurrence.

Given the benign natural history of ABCs and the diversity of available treatments, a comprehensive, individualized, and judicious therapeutic strategy is paramount. For patients with spinal ABCs characterized by adequate stability and an absence of severe neurological deficits, intralesional sclerotherapy represents a viable first-line option, offering high efficacy, although multiple administrations may be required. In instances where sclerotherapy is contraindicated or yields a suboptimal response, Denosumab emerges as a valuable second-line therapy; however, its application necessitates a tailored regimen and diligent long-term monitoring to assess therapeutic effect. Finally, while not a primary intervention, open surgery remains indispensable for the rapid correction of spinal instability and the reversal of acute neurological compromise.
