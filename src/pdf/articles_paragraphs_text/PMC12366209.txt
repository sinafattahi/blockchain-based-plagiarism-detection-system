Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are responsible for substantial illness and death worldwide. Helminthic infections among school-aged children pose a serious public health challenge due to their detrimental effects on health and development.

A wide-ranging search conducted across five databases, including Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to retrieve papers published between 1998 and 2024. To evaluate the combined prevalence, a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied, and the statistical analysis was performed using meta-analysis packages in R version (3.6.1).

There were 190 eligible studies documented in 42 countries, and 199,988 schoolchildren included in this review. The global prevalence of helminthic parasites was 20.6% (17.2– 24.3%). Among the countries studied, Tanzania and Vietnam showed the highest levels of prevalence at 67.41% and 65.04%, respectively, withToxocaraspp. andAscaris lumbricoidesbeing the most prevalent helminthic parasites at 10.36% and 9.47%, respectively.

In conclusion, this study underscores the pressing public health concern of helminthic infections among schoolchildren, largely driven by inadequate sanitation and poor water quality. Prompt action, such as improving sanitation, expanding school-based deworming programs, and enhancing access to safe water, is crucial to control these infections and enhance overall health outcomes.

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are primarily chronic infections that cause significant illness and death, particularly among the world’s poorest populations. These diseases not only impact health but also contribute to the cycle of poverty [1].

Socioeconomic disadvantage is a well-established and significant factor influencing the spread of these diseases. Factors such as poverty and inadequate sanitation play a key role in facilitating parasite transmission [2]. In terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the greatest burden of NTDs is still attributed to soil-transmitted helminth (STHs) infections, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and dengue fever [3].

Intestinal helminth infections are regarded as highly significant socio-economic and public health concerns globally [4]. Their prevalence is higher in tropical and subtropical zones, notably among populations in developing countries facing poverty and poor sanitary conditions [5]. It is approximated that nearly 300 million people suffer from heavy morbidity of intestinal helminths with annual deaths ranging from 10,000 to 135,000 [5,6]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, many people worldwide are infected with these infections. Globally, nearly 2 billion people primarily children are infected with common parasitic diseases such as STHs, which include hookworms (Necator americanus,Ancylostoma duodenale),Ascaris lumbricoides, andTrichuris trichiura[7].

Preschoolers and school-aged children, including adolescents, are disproportionately affected by intestinal helminths and schistosomes for reasons that are not yet well understood. These infections can result in stunted growth, weakened physical health, and impaired cognitive function particularly memory and learning which together negatively impact their educational achievement and school participation [8].

Transmission of intestinal parasites commonly occurs via exposure to contaminated feces, ingestion of raw or undercooked meat, contaminated water or soil, or through transdermal penetration [9]. In children, infection commonly occurs through soil-transmitted routes and behaviors such as nail biting. In high-prevalence regions, approximately 870 million children are estimated to be at risk of soil‑transmitted helminth infections globally, according to WHO [10]. A prevalence rate of high intestinal parasite has been reported in children compared to people of other ages. Intestinal helminths infection in children can lead to severe complications such as malabsorption, malnutrition, disorders of growth and development, anemia and retardation, intestinal obstruction, hemorrhagic diarrhea, fever, dehydration, vomiting and nutritional complications such as iron deficiency anemia. Up to date, numerous studies have been conducted on intestinal parasites prevalence in school-aged children in different countries [11].

According to the geographical and health status of the studied area, statistics have been designed in a wide range, indicating helminth infection as a leading cause of health problem in the world. However, differences in the rate of prevalence of helminth parasites may be related to diverse factors such as climate, geography, socio-economic, and cultural factors [12,13].

Helminth infections in fecal samples are primarily diagnosed using direct smear microscopy, concentration methods, and the Kato-Katz technique for quantifying helminth eggs, includingSchistosomaspecies [14–16]. Today, more accurate DNA-based methods are used to more accurately diagnose infections of this type [10,14]. Preschool and schoolchildren are particularly vulnerable to helminth infections and associated complications like malnutrition and anemia. Due to their higher exposure to contaminated sources such as soil, growing evidence over recent years highlights the importance of prioritizing infection risk in this population. These findings are critical in creating proper and effective interventions [17–19].

This systematic review and meta-analysis focused on estimating the global prevalence of helminthic parasite in school-age children via synthesizing data across studies in distinct geographic locations. The findings of this review are expected to support evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing the burden of soil-transmitted helminthic infections among school-aged children.

This study adhered to the guidelines established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Fig.1) [20]. We systematically searched several databases, including Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, to collect relevant papers published between 1998 and 2024, applying no date restrictions (Supplementary Table 1).

We used search terms associated with the prevalence, epidemiology, incidence, parasites, parasitic diseases, parasitic infections, helminthiasis, parasitic helminth, helminth parasites, helminthic infections, helminth diseases, pathogenic helminth, intestinal helminth, preschool and/or school-age children, global, and worldwide, using both AND and/or Boolean operators.

Duplicates were removed using EndNote X9 software library and manual verification, followed by manual screening of reference lists to capture relevant studies potentially missed by the database search. After automatic and manual duplicate removal (21,350 duplicates), 2,906 unique records were screened.

Two reviewers (ZG and HS) independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (MB). Data extraction and quality assessment were also independently conducted by ZG and HS, with supervision by AVE and MB.

Articles were included if they were cross-sectional studies documenting helminthic infections in schoolchildren, published as original research in peer-reviewed journals, available in English with both abstracts and full texts accessible, and reporting the total sample size and the number of positive cases.

Studies classified as case series, case reports, letters, editorials, publications lacking original data, review articles, those with inconclusive findings, non-English publications, and studies reporting parasitic helminths from non-human samples were excluded from this analysis.

Microsoft Excel® version 2016 was employed to systematically extract the following data from the included articles: author names, publication year, climate, annual rainfall, average temperature, humidity, gender, age, mean age, educational level, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, WHO region, countries, district/city/province, Human Development Index (HDI), income level, type of samples, diagnostic method, and type of helminth parasites (Tables1,2and3).

The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, as detailed in Supplementary Table 2 [21]. Scores were assigned across three domains: Selection (maximum 5 stars), Comparability (maximum 2 stars), and Outcome (maximum 3 stars).

Studies scoring 7–9 on the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale were classified as high quality and included. Studies scoring 4–6 were classified as moderate quality. Studies scoring < 4 or lacking sufficient methodological clarity were excluded due to high risk of bias or insufficient data.

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (ZG and HS) using a standardized Excel form. The extracted data included study characteristics, sample size, diagnostic methods, and prevalence rates. Cross-verification was conducted by a third author (AVE) to ensure data accuracy.

A range of statistical techniques was applied to thoroughly assess the worldwide prevalence of helminthic infections in school-aged children. The overall pooled prevalence was calculated using a 95% confidence interval (CI).

A random-effects model incorporating the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Publication bias was evaluated through Egger’s funnel plot, Begg’s rank test, the Luis Furuya-Kanamori (LFK) index, and the Doi plot [22].

An LFK index outside ± 2 was classified as major asymmetry, between ± 1 and ± 2 as minor asymmetry, and within ± 1 as symmetry, indicating no publication bias.

To evaluate heterogeneity across studies, Cochrane’s Q test and the inconsistency index (I2) were applied.I2values were interpreted as follows: 0–25% indicated low heterogeneity, 25–50% moderate heterogeneity, and 50–75% high heterogeneity. Ap-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using the meta and metasens packages in R (version 3.6.1) [23].

The systematic search conducted in this study initially identified 24,256 articles. We retrieved 20,900 records from Google Scholar, 1,879 from PubMed, 1,033 from Web of Science, 352 from Scopus, and 92 from EMBASE.

After screening, 228 full-text articles were reviewed for eligibility. Of these, two studies were excluded due to insufficient data, two for overlapping data, three for lacking participant information, and 31 for not containing original data (e.g., letters, reviews, workshop reports, and theses). Ultimately, 190 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis following critical appraisal (Fig.1).

Data on the prevalence of helminthic parasites have been reported from 42 countries, and 199,988 schoolchildren, with Nepal (33 studies) and India (21 studies) being the most frequently represented (Table2). The estimated global prevalence was 20.6% (17.2–24.3%) (Fig.2).

According to the data collected in the included studies, a map was generated using QGIS3 software (https://qgis.org/en/site/) to illustrate the prevalence of helminthic parasites among schoolchildren in various regions of the world (Fig.3a). A Sankey plot indicated that the largest number of studies in GBD regions was related to Nepal (Fig.3b).

The overall prevalence of helminthic parasites among schoolchildren was as detailed: 10.36% (7.08–15.13%) forToxocaraspp.,9.47% (7.32–11.85%) forA. lumbricoides, 8.87% (6.34–11.85%) forHeterophyes heterophyes, 7.82% (3.43–13.76%) forSchistosomaspp., 5.83% (3.86–8.16%) forT. trichiura, 4.57% (3.30–6.03%) for hookworms, 3.03% (2.35–3.78%) forHymenolepis nana, 2.75% (1.97–3.65%) forEnterobius vermicularis, 2.39% (1.16–5.18%) forRhabditisspp., 2.34% (1.45–3.42%) forTaeniaspp., 1.83% (0.33–4.36%) forFasciolaspp.,1.65% (0.76–2.83%) forStrongyloides stercoralis, 1.45% (0.008–2.32%) forWuchereria bancrofti, 1.44% (0.23–3.55%) forOpisthorchisspp., 0.62% (0.04–1.73%) forDicrocoelium dendriticum, 0.58% (0.01–1.78%) forTrichostrongylusspp., 0.24% (0.04–1.33%) forGongylonemaspp. (Table3).

The highest pooled prevalence based on type of sample was estimated at 47.27% (18.72–76.83%) for studies using both stool and urine samples (Table2). Based on the diagnostic methods used, the highest prevalence was reported in studies employing the Kato-Katz technique, with an estimated rate of 51.9% (20.65–82.34%) (Table2).

WHO regional estimates of prevalence spanned from 40.90% to 13.24%, with 40.90% (26.74–55.88%) in Western Pacific Region, 40.73% (24.38–58.21%) in Region of the Americas, 35.99% (24.72%– 48.09%) in African Region, 23.67% (5.88–48.51%) in European Region, 15.33% (10.19–21.28%) in Eastern Mediterranean Region, 13.24% (9.69–17.24%) in South-East Asian Region (Table2). Findings from country-based analyses revealed that Tanzania had the highest prevalence (67.41%, 14.04–99.96%) followed by Vietnam (65.04%, 26.48–94.62%) (Table2).

The estimated pooled prevalence based on countries income level ranged from 26.95% to 2.67%, with the highest rate observed in low income (26.95%, 18.74–36.03%) (Table2). Based on the HDI, the highest prevalence was observed in countries with low human development, at 35.35% (25.97–45.34) (Table2).

Analysis by education level revealed that primary school children had the greatest pooled prevalence, 21.86% (17.96–26.03%) (Table2). Furthermore, schoolchildren aged 10–15 years showed the highest prevalence rate among all age groups, estimated at 22.32% (16.56–28.68%) (Table2). Additionally, the highest pooled prevalence as indicated by gender was observed among male schoolchildren, at 33.15% (28.17–38.33%) (Table2).

The analyses revealed that regions with average annual rainfall of 400–1000 mm 30.85% (21.77–40.73%) had the highest rate of pooled prevalence (Table2). Furthermore, regions with average temperature of >20 °C (25.94%, 21.15–31.04%) had the highest rate of prevalence for helminthic parasites among schoolchildren (Table2). Moreover, the highest pooled prevalence rate of 21.42% (17.10–26.07%) was observed at a humidity range of 40–75% (Table2). In addition, we found that tropical rainforest climate had the highest prevalence rate (35.44%, 22.47–49.61%) (Table2).

Significant heterogeneity was detected for annual rainfall and year of publication, though the association with annual rainfall was not statistically significant (slop = 13.167,p< 0.07), and year of publication for all studies included (slop = 0.411,p< 0.06) (Fig.4a-b).

A non-significant publication bias was detected using Egger’s test (t = 5.59,p< 0.001). Furthermore, there was a major asymmetry in the Doi plot (LFK index: 2.71) (Fig.5a-c).

According to the quality assessment, 120 of the 190 studies were rated as high quality (scores of 7–9), and 70 were rated as moderate quality (scores of 4–6) (Supplementary Table 2).

While Egger’s test detected some asymmetry (p< 0.001), this could reflect true heterogeneity due to variations in study design, location, or diagnostic sensitivity. The LFK index of 2.71 further indicated possible publication bias. However, the inclusion of studies with moderate-to-high quality scores (≥ 4) and clear eligibility criteria suggests a reliable evidence base. Still, the interpretation of the results should be with caution due to the inherent risk of reporting bias and study-level variability.

This study emphasizes the substantial global impact of helminthic infections in schoolchildren, highlighting their continued role as a major public health concern, especially in low-income and tropical areas. The findings support earlier research showing that helminthiasis remains a significant health problem, predominantly in areas where sanitation is poor, clean water is scarce, and socioeconomic inequalities are noticeable [4,5,24,25].

We observed the highest prevalence rates in the Western Pacific Region and the Region of the Americas, with Tanzania and Vietnam reporting the highest country-specific rates. These patterns reflect the impact of geographical and climatic factors on helminth transmission, as tropical and subtropical regions with warm temperatures and high rainfall offer the most favourable conditions for the survival and spread of STHs [5,6].

The subgroup analyses in this study demonstrated notably high infection rates in low-income countries, where environmental and infrastructural conditions favour transmission. These findings are in line with studies from similar settings, and they point to socio-economic status as a primary risk determinant of helminth infection [4,5,10]. The elevated prevalence in low-income countries further focuses on the role played by poor medical facilities and poverty in perpetuating such infections [9].

Among the helminth species encountered,A. lumbricoidesandToxocaraspp. were the most frequently isolated. This dominancy aligns with their widespread distribution and efficient transmission routes, e.g., ingestion of contaminated food or soil [10]. The high occurrence ofA. lumbricoidessupports its classification as major STHs by the WHO, affecting nearly two billion people globally [11]. These infections pose significant risks to children’s health, frequently causing iron-deficiency anaemia, delayed physical development, learning difficulties, and poor nutritional status [10,17,19].

Beyond STHs, our study revealed significant burdens from food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne helminths, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. Schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern in endemic areas, particularly among school-aged children, who suffer from chronic morbidity including hepatic and urogenital inflammation, anemia, and cognitive impairments as a result of repeated exposure during water-contact activities [26]. Toxocariasis, primarily transmitted through contact with soil-contaminated hands or inadequately washed produce, poses significant health risks, including visceral and ocular larva migrans, exacerbation of asthma, and neurocognitive impairments [27]. The high pooled prevalence ofH. heterophyeshighlights the health risks associated with consuming raw or undercooked fish, which can lead to intestinal mucosal ulceration and abdominal pain that is often misdiagnosed [28].

A total of about 1.5 billion individuals globally are infected with STHs, with the highest burden residing in the tropics and subtropics most notably in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and South Asia, where infection rates still persist higher than anywhere else. The environmental and soil conditions in such regions are conducive to survival of the STHs in the external environment. Inadequate personal and environmental hygiene, lack of access to safe water, and unsanitary facilities also promote transmission of STH infection [29]. Our study showed that climate poses a potent role in determining prevalence with high levels present in tropical rainforest and rainfall areas of 400–1000 mm per annum. These environments support survival of helminth eggs and larvae outside the host and hence transmission [13].

Variation in prevalence between species is also caused by variation in their diagnosis methods, with Kato-Katz technique having the highest rate of detection because of its sensitivity when counting STH eggs [12]. Although microscopy remains the global standard, DNA‑based diagnostics (e.g. conventional PCR, qPCR, multiplex PCR and LAMP) offer significantly higher sensitivity—especially in low-intensity infections—and the capacity to detect mixed-species helminth infections accurately, providing species-level identification and quantitative data beyond microscopy’s reach [12,15,16]. Differences in diagnostic methods across countries may lead to bias. Countries that use more sensitive methods such as Kato-Katz or molecular diagnostics will tend to report higher prevalence not necessarily due to higher infection rates, but due to improved detection. The difference may affect cross-country comparison and needs to be adjusted for while interpreting results.

High rates of helminthic infection in children demand stronger global commitment and intervention to eliminate these infectious diseases. Improved sanitation services, safe water accessibility, and mass drug administration (MDA) programs remain basis strategies [30]. Furthermore, integrating health education in schools to promote hygiene practices, such as handwashing and wearing shoes, would significantly reduce transmission [19].

The MDA holds significant promise for disease control, yet it also faces notable challenges and limitations. One of the major obstacles is the lack of adequate funding. Advancing research and development, conducting essential clinical trials to optimize treatment, and ensuring the procurement, distribution, and long-term maintenance of drug supplies all demand considerable financial and logistical resources that are currently insufficient. Moreover, the narrow range of available chemotherapeutic agents heightens the risk of drug resistance due to overuse.

Effective control of helminth infections requires more than only MDA. For schistosomiasis, key measures include minimizing snail breeding sites and promoting safe practices around recreational water use. To prevent fish- and food-borne helminths, raising community awareness about safe food handling, thorough cooking, and personal hygiene is vital for reducing transmission.

Effective pharmaco-epidemiological surveillance involves tracking drug efficacy, treatment coverage, and emerging resistance patterns, which requires investment in laboratory infrastructure, standardized monitoring protocols, and integration into national surveillance systems to detect and respond to resistance early [31]. While this strategy has shown some positive outcomes, the growing global threat of antimicrobial resistance, largely driven by excessive drug use, raises concerns that these short-term benefits may come at the cost of long-term consequences by promoting further drug resistance [32].

The study also revealed that children in primary schools were most affected, perhaps due to their increased exposure to infested soil and poor hygiene after playing or during daily activities [15]. The finding underscores the need for focused school-based deworming exercises and health education for preventing transmission among this vulnerable age group [16].

Although intestinal helminth infections rarely cause mortality, they are significant causes of disability among children and have long-term socioeconomic repercussions, including reduced earning capacity in adulthood. The parasitic infections most frequently pose significant challenges for children living in poverty especially in poor rural or urban areas with very limited access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) [7].

Enhancing socioeconomic conditions, along with implementing several key strategic interventions, is critical [33]. This approach involves the use of preventive chemotherapy for preschool and schoolchildren [29,34]; ensuring availability of proper sanitation, waste management, improved hygiene, and safe water in both households and schools; advancing diagnostic and treatment services for individuals in STH-endemic regions; and promoting health awareness in at-risk populations to improve behavioural changes that lower transmission risk [35].

This review has the listed limitations: 1) reliance on published data may have led to selection bias since studies from underrepresented regions or with non-significant results might have been excluded; 2) heterogeneity in diagnostic techniques among studies may affect the accuracy of prevalence estimates; 3) some subgroup analyses were based on a small number of studies, which may affect the stability and generalizability of the prevalence estimates. Therefore, caution is advised when interpreting these findings.

This meta-analysis provides a global overview of helminthic infections in schoolchildren and their disproportionate burden in tropical, resource-limited settings. The findings support the necessity for enhanced prevention and treatment measures to control the adverse health and developmental effects of helminthic infections. Future studies need to address longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of interventions and study socioeconomic determinants of transmission of the helminths.

To make lasting progress in the fight against helminth infections among schoolchildren, several important steps are needed: 1) More long-term studies are essential to understand how well current interventions work over time. These studies should also explore how factors like poverty, living conditions, and the environment influence the spread of infections. This knowledge will help shape more effective and lasting solutions; 2) Expanding school-based deworming programs and improving access to WASH can make a meaningful difference in children's health. Making helminth control a national public health priority is crucial to reaching those most at risk; 3) Local education efforts that teach simple but powerful hygiene practices like handwashing and using safe toilets can greatly reduce the spread of infection. It's also vital to ensure that all children, especially those in underserved or remote areas, have fair access to preventive treatment.
