In this study, a novel electrochemical sensor based on a carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with polyaniline (PANI) and green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was developed for the simultaneous detection of cadmium (Cd2+) and lead (Pb2+) ions in aqueous solutions. The AgNPs were synthesized using a green route employing plant extract as a reducing and capping agent, ensuring environmental sustainability. The modified electrode (AgNPs-PANI-CPE) was characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), and simultaneous thermal analysis (TGA/DSC). The electrochemical behavior of Cd2+and Pb2+was investigated using square wave voltammetry (SWV) and CV. The sensor exhibited distinct and well-separated anodic peaks for Cd2+and Pb2+, with excellent sensitivity, wide linear response ranges, and low detection limits (0.09 and 0.05 μg L−1, respectively). Interference studies demonstrated good selectivity towards the target ions, and successful application to real water samples confirmed its analytical performance. This work highlights the potential of eco-friendly nanocomposite-modified electrodes in environmental monitoring of toxic heavy metals.

A novel electrochemical sensor based on a CPE modified with PANI and green-synthesized AgNPs was developed for the simultaneous detection of Cd2+and Pb2+ions in aqueous solution.

Heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments has become a major global concern due to its detrimental impact on ecosystems and human health. Among these metals, cadmium (Cd2+) and lead (Pb2+) are particularly toxic even at trace levels. These ions can accumulate in biological tissues, causing neurological, renal, and developmental disorders.1,2The World Health Organization has set very low permissible limits for Cd2+(0.003 mg L−1) and Pb2+(0.1 mg L−1) in drinking water due to their high toxicity.3Electochemical techniques have emerged as powerful tools for the detection of trace metals due to their high sensitivity, simplicity, low cost, and potential for miniaturization.4Among them, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) are widely employed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of metal ions.5,6However, the selectivity and sensitivity of these methods largely depend on the nature and properties of the working electrode.

In this research, we developed a new electrochemical sensor for simultaneous determination of Cd2+, Pb2+using square wave voltammetry (SWV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) with high sensitivity and low detection limit.

For the first time, we report the use of a new carbon paste electrode based on low-cost pencil graphite powder modified with PANI and green synthesized silver nanoparticles using olive leaves extract.

The fabricated electrode was characterized through a combination of techniques. The surface morphology of the electrode materials was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM, Quattro S), along with elemental composition analysis. Thermal stability was evaluated using a simultaneous thermal analyzer (TGA/DSC: TGA/DTG 3 + 1600 °C, Mettler Toledo). Electrochemical measurements were conducted using either a potentiostat/galvanostat 273A or a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research, AMETEK, USA). The latter was specifically employed for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). All measurements were carried out using a conventional three-electrode system consisting of a platinum wire as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode, and the modified carbon paste electrodes as the working electrodes. All potentials are reported with respect to the Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode.

Carbon paste was prepared by thoroughly mixing 90 g finely grounded pencil graphite powder with ten drops of paraffin oil in a mortar until a homogenous or at least 20 min till a smoothly wetted and suitably firm paste texture was achieved. To fabricate the modified electrode: a portion of the paste was mixed with a known amount of dried AgNPs for at least 20 min till a smoothly wetted and suitably firm paste texture was achieved. The paste was filled and packed in a glass cylinder with 9 mm of diameter and 60 mm of length. A copper wire was sealed to a plunger that was in close contact with the paste and extended to the outside of the cylinder to ensure electrical contact.

Supporting electrolyte was typically 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The accumulation potential and time, scan parameters, and peak separation were optimized for simultaneous detection of Cd(ii) and Pb(ii), and the optimum amplitude used for SWV was 25 mV.

Tap water and synthetic seawater samples were filtered and spiked with known concentrations of Cd2+and Pb2+for recovery studies. The electrochemical response was measured under optimized conditions.

All experiments, including electrochemical (SWV, CV, EIS) and spectroscopic (UV-Vis, TGA) measurements, were performed in triplicate (n= 3) to ensure reproducibility and reliability. Results are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Sensitivity was derived from the slope of the linear regression equation obtained from calibration plots.

All calibration curves include error bars representing ± standard deviation from three independent measurements. The graphs shown in the manuscript are representative of these repeated measurements.

The FT-IR spectrum of the olive leaf extract reveals several characteristic absorption bands inFig. 3aindicating the presence of various bioactive functional groups involved in the green synthesis and stabilization of silver nanoparticles.

The broad and intense band centered at 3303 cm−1is attributed to the O–H stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups, commonly present in polyphenols and flavonoids.

Peaks at 2926 cm−1and 2854 cm−1correspond to C–H stretching vibrations of aliphatic –CH2−groups, suggesting the presence of aliphatic chains in the extract.

A weak band near 2369 cm−1is possibly due to OCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O stretching of atmospheric CO2or residual carbonyl-containing compounds.

The absorption band around 1633 cm−1is associated with CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O stretching of conjugated carbonyls or CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C stretching of aromatic rings.

The peak at 1329 cm−1corresponds to C–N stretching vibrations from aromatic amines.

The band observed at 1024 cm−1is indicative of C–O stretching vibrations from alcohols, ethers, or carboxylic acids.

These identified functional groups confirm the presence of biomolecules such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and amino compounds, which are known to act as natural reducing and stabilizing agents in the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

The UV-Vis absorption spectrum shown inFig. 3breveals a strong and narrow surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band centered around approximately 435 nm, which is characteristic of the formation of colloidal silver nanoparticles. This plasmonic peak arises from the collective oscillation of conduction electrons at the surface of silver nanoparticles when excited by light, and it is highly sensitive to particle size, shape, distribution, and the surrounding medium.

The appearance of a single, sharp peak indicates that the synthesized AgNPs are spherical, well-dispersed, and relatively uniform in size, with little to no aggregation. According to recent studies, silver nanoparticles typically exhibit SPR peaks in the range of 400–450 nm when they are spherical and smaller than 50 nm.29The observed maximum at ∼435 nm supports the formation of small-sized AgNPs with good stability and minimal agglomeration.

The influence of deposition potential and deposition time on the electrochemical response of Cd2+and Pb2+ions (100 μg L−1each) was investigated using square wave voltammetry in 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5). These parameters are critical for optimizing the preconcentration step, which directly affects the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor. The peak currents of both Cd2+and Pb2+increased as the deposition potential became more negative, reaching a maximum at −1.0 V. Beyond this value, the current began to decrease slightly, likely due to the onset of hydrogen evolution, which interferes with metal ion deposition. Therefore, −1.0 V was chosen as the optimal deposition potential, balancing efficient reduction of metal ions with minimal interference. An increase in deposition time led to a proportional increase in the stripping peak currents for both ions, reflecting greater accumulation of metal ions on the electrode surface. However, the current tended to plateau beyond 120 seconds, indicating saturation of the active sites on the modified sensitivity and reasonable analysis time.

On the other hand, the electrolyte solution pH has a significant role in electrochemical determination of metal ions. InFig. 4c, Cd2+and Pb2+current response. It can be observed that peaks current gradually increase reaching an optimal value for pH = 4.5. For electrolytes with pH greater than 4.5.

These results confirm that the AgNPs-PANI-modified carbon paste electrode provides effective preconcentration and detection of Cd2+and Pb2+under optimized conditions, demonstrating its suitability for trace-level monitoring in aqueous media.

The CV curves were recorded at various scan rates ranging from 10 to 120 mV s−1. As observed, the peak current (Ip) increases progressively with the increase in the scan rate (ν). The anodic and cathodic peaks become more pronounced and shift slightly, which is characteristic of a quasi-reversible electrochemical process.

The effect of the potential scan on the electrochemical behavior of the elaborated electrode was performed using potassium ferrocyanide–ferricyanide probe solution containing 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−and 0.1 M KCl (Fig. 5).

This linearity is a hallmark of a diffusion-controlled redox process, which is further corroborated by the plot of log(i)versuslog(v) (Fig. 6C), showing a linear relationship indicative of diffusion-governed kinetics.

wheren,v,C,A, andDrepresent the number of electrons exchanged (n= 1), the scan rate, the bulk concentration, the electroactive surface area, and the diffusion coefficient of 5 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−in 0.1 M KCl, respectively. The calculated values of the real electroactive surface areas are summarized inTable 1.

As shown inTable 1, the electroactive surface area increases progressively with each step of electrode modification, indicating a successful enhancement of the electrode surface and improved electron transfer properties.

The cyclic voltammograms shown inFig. 7areveal significant differences between the bare CPE and the progressively modified electrodes, particularly in terms of peak current intensities, the potential separation between anodic and cathodic peaks (ΔEp), and the anodic-to-cathodic peak current ratio (Ipa/Ipc). These electrochemical parameters are summarized inTable 1. The observed variations not only confirm the successful modification of the electrode surface, but also indicate a shift toward a more reversible redox system upon incorporation of PANI and AgNPs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to investigate the electron transfer behavior at the surface of the carbon paste electrode (CPE) before and after modification. The Nyquist plots presented inFig. 7adisplay semicircles in the high-frequency region, characteristic of charge transfer processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. For the unmodified CPE, the observed semicircle corresponds to a charge transfer resistance (Rct). Upon modification with polyaniline (PANI), the semicircle diameter decreased significantly, indicating a reduction (green curve). This decrease reflects enhanced electron transfer kinetics attributed to the conductive nature of the PANI layer.

Further deposition of (AgNPs) onto the PANI-modified CPE resulted in a further decrease, suggesting an improved interfacial charge transfer process. This enhancement is likely due to the synergistic effect between PANI and AgNPs, which modified the electrode surface properties and facilitates electron transport.

Overall, these results demonstrate that the AgNPs-PANI-CPE exhibits superior charge transfer performance compared to the bare CPE, confirming the beneficial role of surface modification in enhancing electrochemical activity.

The square wave voltammetry (SWV) responses inFig. 8recorded for the simultaneous detection of Cd2+and Pb2+using three different working electrodes demonstrate clear differences in peak intensity and definition.

The unmodified carbon paste electrode (CPE) exhibits weak and poorly defined peaks for both metal ions, indicating low sensitivity and limited electrocatalytic activity.

Upon modification with polyaniline (PANI), a noticeable enhancement in peak current is observed for both Cd2+and Pb2+, suggesting improved conductivity and electron transfer kinetics due to the conductive polymer film.

The electrode further modified with green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) displays the highest peak currents and the most distinct separation between the Cd2+and Pb2+peaks. This enhancement is attributed to the synergistic effect between PANI and AgNPs, which increases the electroactive surface area and promotes more efficient preconcentration and redox reaction of the target ions.

These results confirm that the PANI/AgNPs-modified CPE offers superior performance for the simultaneous detection of Cd2+and Pb2+compared to the bare or singly modified electrodes.

Fig. 9presents the simultaneous detection of a mixture of Cd2+and Pb2+in the concentration range of 0.1 to 6 μg L−1, carried out under optimized conditions using the AgNPs-PANI-CPE electrode in. 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5) The square wave voltammetry responses exhibit a progressive increase in peak currents with increasing concentrations of the two metal ions. A slight positive shift in peak potentials was observed as concentrations increased, which due to changes in mass transport and interfacial kinetics. Nevertheless, the individual peaks corresponding to Cd2+and Pb2+remained well-defined and clearly separated. Remarkably, the sensitivity and linearity of the sensor towards each metal ion were maintained, and no significant shift in peak positions was observed when compared to their individual detections. These results indicate the absence of mutual interference among the ions during simultaneous determination.

Peaks current increase with metal ions concentration increase, giving a linear relationship between peak current amplitude and concentration. The limit of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) for Cd2+and Pb2+were calculated to be 0.09 μg L−1and 0.05 μg L−1, respectively.

To evaluate the simultaneous detection of the metal ions (Cd2+and Pb2+) in 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5) using the AgNPs-PANI-CPE electrode, cyclic voltammetry was performed within the potential window of −0.1 to 0.7 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1(seeFig. 10). As anticipated, similar electrochemical behavior was observed in the multi-metal system, characterized by a progressive increase in peak currents with rising metal ion concentrations. This behavior resulted in a linear correlation for Cd2+and Pb2+. The limits of detection (LOD) were estimated at 0.27 μg L−1for Cd2+, 0.15 μg L−1for Pb2+.

Moreover, the newly developed electrode fabrication approach demonstrated a favorable linear response range and low detection limits. A comparison of the analytical performance parameters with those reported for various electrochemical sensors in previous studies highlights the superior performance of the AgNPs-PANI-CPE sensor, as summarized inTable 2.

Ionic liquid/CNF/Bi/CPE: ionic liquid/carbon nanofibers/bismuth/carbon past electrode; BiONPs/PANI/SPCE: bismuth oxide nanoparticles/polyaniline/screen-printed electrode; CPE/PANI-PDTDA: carbon past electrode/polyaniline-2,5-bis(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole; UiO-66-NH2-Mxene@rGO/GCE: UiO-66-NH2(Zr-based MOF)/Mxene nanosheetd anchored on reduced graphene oxide/glassy carbon electrode; Ag2WO4NC: silver tungstate nanocrystals; (M-γ-Al2O3): anosized mesoporous γ-alumina; AgNPs-PANI-CPE: silver nanoparticles-polyaniline-carbon paste electrode.

Moreover, the simultaneous detection capability with well-resolved peaks and minimal interference highlights the advantage of using a synergistic nanocomposite consisting of polyaniline and green-synthesized AgNPs. Compared to previous reports such as UiO-66-NH2-Mxene@rGO/GCE38or BiONPs/PANI/SPCE,40the proposed sensor offers a simpler fabrication process, lower cost, and greener synthesis pathway, while maintaining excellent sensitivity and selectivity.

Therefore, this work contributes to the growing field of green electroanalytical chemistry by proposing a sustainable, low-cost sensor platform for environmental monitoring of toxic metal ions in water systems. The integration of biogenic nanomaterials with conducting polymers provides a scalable strategy that can be further optimized for broader environmental applications.

The AgNPs-PANI-CPE sensor was evaluated for its selectivity in detecting the target metal ions (Cd2+and Pb2+) in 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5) the presence of various potential interfering substances. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were carried out in 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5) solution containing 50 μg L−1of each target ion, while progressively adding common interfering ions such as Ag+, Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+.

For repeatability, three successive measurements of 1.0 μg L−1Cd2+and Pb2+were performed under identical conditions using the same electrode. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values were found to be below 3.0%, indicating good short-term precision (Fig. 12a).

To assess reproducibility, three independently prepared AgNPs-PANI-CPE electrodes were tested under the same conditions. The RSD values remained below 4.2%, confirming that the fabrication process is consistent and reproducible.

The stability of the modified electrode was tested by storing it at room temperature and measuring its response every two days over a period of 14 days. The sensor retained more than 92% of its initial signal, demonstrating excellent operational stability and suitability for routine analysis (Fig. 12b).

In this study, a green-synthesized silver nanoparticle and polyaniline-modified carbon paste electrode (AgNPs-PANI-CPE) was successfully developed and applied for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of Cd(ii) and Pb(ii) ions. The surface characterization confirmed the effective integration of uniformly dispersed AgNPs onto the conductive PANI matrix, enhancing the electrode's active surface area and electron transfer capabilities. Electrochemical investigations using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) demonstrated the high sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility of the modified electrode for detecting trace levels of the target heavy metals. The method showed low detection limits, good linearity, and strong potential for practical application in environmental monitoring, particularly in marine environments. This eco-friendly approach not only provides an efficient sensing platform but also aligns with sustainable development goals by utilizing green synthesis methods and promoting low-cost sensor fabrication.

Future work will focus on improving the stability and reusability of the sensor, extending the detection to other heavy metals (e.g., Hg2+, As3+), and applying the electrode in real field scenarios with varied water matrices. Moreover, the use of other plant-based extracts or biopolymers may be explored to develop new green nanocomposites for electrochemical sensing.
