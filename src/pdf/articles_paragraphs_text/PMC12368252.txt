Driven by global low-carbon governance and China’s goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, enterprises, as the main players in carbon emissions and economic development, are faced with the test of achieving a win-win situation between their own economic benefits and social benefits. This paper uses data of non-financial A-share listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2008 to 2018 to empirically examine the impact of corporate carbon emissions on firm value and its mechanism. The study finds that the higher the corporate carbon emissions, the lower the firm value. After tests using the difference-in-differences model, instrumental variable analysis, and placebo tests, the research results remain robust. Mechanism analysis shows that corporate carbon emissions have a negative impact on firm value by reducing the corporate risk-taking level, product market competitiveness, and the shareholding ratio of green investors. Further research reveals that the negative impact of corporate carbon emissions on firm value is more significant in enterprises with high agency costs, high real earnings management levels, and poor corporate social responsibility performance. The research contributions of this paper are mainly reflected in three aspects: first, it is the first to reveal the direct effect of carbon emission risks on firm value in the Chinese context, expanding the research dimension on the economic consequences of carbon emission risks; second, it enriches the research on factors affecting firm value and expands the boundary of theoretical interpretation; third, it explores the heterogeneous characteristics of how carbon emission risks affect firm value and defines the boundary conditions of the relationship between the two.

As the world’s largest developing country and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China’s pursuit of low-carbon development holds great significance for global climate governance. At the micro level of economic and social development, enterprises, as core entities, have achieved the growth of their own value and driven overall social and economic progress under the previous extensive economic growth model; however, they have also become the main source of carbon emission risks. As an inevitable by-product in the process of enterprise development, the continuous growth of carbon emission risks has triggered a series of challenges that hinder enterprises’ sustainable development. Specifically, the greater the carbon emission risks an enterprise faces, the higher the risks associated with managing and controlling such emissions. Therefore, the impact of carbon emission risks on enterprises has gradually become a focus of academic and practical attention.

This study takes non-financial A-share listed companies in China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2008 to 2018 as the research sample to examine the direct effect of corporate carbon emission risks on firm value. It further explores the mediating mechanism through which corporate carbon emission risks affect firm value from three paths: corporate risk-taking level, product market competitiveness, and shareholding ratio of green institutional investors. On this basis, this study reveals the heterogeneity of the impact of corporate carbon emission risks on firm value from three different perspectives: corporate earnings manipulation, agency costs, and social responsibility.

The empirical findings of this study show that the greater the corporate carbon emission risks, the lower the firm value. In the robustness tests, this study uses alternative explanatory variables and explained variables to confirm the consistency of the results, conducts placebo tests to exclude the impact of non-policy factors on the research results, and applies the instrumental variable method to address potential sample selection bias in the study, thereby verifying the robustness of the research conclusions. Mechanism analysis reveals that there is a mediating effect in the impact of corporate carbon emission risks on firm value: corporate carbon emission risks reduce firm value by lowering the corporate risk-taking level, product market competitiveness, and shareholding ratio of green institutional investors. Further heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative impact of corporate carbon emission risks on firm value is more pronounced in enterprises with a high degree of earnings management, high agency costs, poor social responsibility ratings, and low levels of green innovation.

The research contributions of this paper may lie in the following aspects.

First, this paper enriches the research on the economic consequences of corporate carbon emission risks. Existing studies on the economic consequences of corporate carbon emission risks mostly focus on impacts on intermediate links and have not directly linked them to firm value, the core objective. Some studies focus on financing activities, finding that high carbon emissions increase corporate financing costs5,6and reduce bank loans7but fail to extend to the ultimate impact on firm value. Other studies explore operational activities, noting that carbon emissions may affect corporate technology choices8or compliance risks9yet do not establish a direct connection with firm value. A small number of studies involving firm value only focus on market reactions to carbon emission disclosures, without in-depth analysis of how carbon emission risks themselves affect value. In contrast, this paper, for the first time in the Chinese context, directly incorporates carbon emission risks and firm value into the same analytical framework, filling the research gap in existing literature regarding the direct link between carbon emission risks and firm value, and expanding the research dimension of the economic consequences of carbon emissions (from intermediate links to ultimate objectives).

Second, this paper enriches research on factors influencing firm value and expands the boundary of theoretical interpretation. Existing research on factors influencing firm value has formed a multi-dimensional framework, but there remains a lack of systematic exploration into how environmental risks (especially carbon emissions) affect firm value through specific pathways. Theoretically, existing studies mostly focus on traditional factors: from the perspective of shareholder rights, they examine the role of capital inputs such as private equity10and human capital; from the perspective of financial efficiency, they analyze the impact of internal operational factors such as investment efficiency11and financing constraints; from the perspective of stakeholder theory, they emphasize the role of social responsibility12. However, these studies mostly treat environmental factors as exogenous variables and do not deeply analyze how carbon emission risks are transmitted to the value level through internal corporate behaviors and market reactions. By clarifying the transmission logic of carbon emission risks through risk-taking, market competitiveness, and shareholdings of green investors, this paper incorporates environmental risk—an emerging variable—into the system of factors influencing firm value. This not only enriches the research dimension of drivers of firm value but also provides micro-level evidence for understanding the complete chain of “environmental behavior—corporate behavior—market reaction—value outcome,” thereby expanding the explanatory boundary of traditional theories regarding the formation mechanism of firm value.

Third, it explores the heterogeneous characteristics of how carbon emission risks affect firm value and defines the boundary conditions of their relationship. Existing studies have insufficiently focused on the contextual dependence of the relationship between environmental factors and firm value, failing to clarify differences in their association under different corporate characteristics. From multiple perspectives including corporate earnings manipulation, agency costs, and social responsibility, this paper finds that the impact is more pronounced in enterprises with a high degree of earnings management, high agency costs, and poor social responsibility ratings. This research not only clarifies the boundary conditions under which carbon emission risks affect firm value, providing a basis for formulating differentiated risk management strategies, but also refines and extends the application of stakeholder theory in the field of environmental risks13.

Currently, the global climate is deteriorating increasingly, posing significant risks to human society and ecosystems. Among these factors, greenhouse gas emissions are one of the primary causes of climate change. As the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China’s implementation of carbon emission reduction is conducive to promoting the coordinated development of the economy and environmental protection, as well as fulfilling international commitments. With the proposal of the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, enterprises will encounter new opportunities and challenges in environmental activities such as carbon management, energy transition, and technological innovation. A high level of carbon emission risk indicates a high level of future environmental liabilities, leading to higher current and expected costs. Therefore, the market will adjust stock prices accordingly, and in turn, corporate value will be affected by their emission levels9.

First, an increase in corporate carbon emission risk will reduce firms’ risk-taking capacity, which in turn lowers corporate value. According to stakeholder theory, corporate decision-making is constrained by internal and external stakeholders, requiring enterprises to balance the interests of various parties while maximizing shareholder wealth13. High carbon emission risk exposes firms to financial distress. Corporate risk-taking capacity is closely linked to the availability of sufficient financial support. Enterprises with high carbon emission risk face higher financing costs5,6and obtain fewer new bank loans7resulting in reduced access to funds and thus a decline in their risk-taking capacity. Uncertainty and risk-taking are prerequisites for enterprises to gain returns. A reasonable level of risk-taking plays a crucial role in promoting the development of micro-enterprises and macroeconomic growth14thereby affecting corporate value.

Second, from the perspective of product market competitiveness, corporate carbon emission risk reduces corporate value by lowering product market competitiveness.Market competition theory suggests that in the face of external pressures arising from intense industry competition, to maintain and expand market share, corporate shareholders and other external stakeholders will pressure managers to adjust existing strategies, break with conventions to pursue innovative development, and thus gain an advantageous position in the game with competitors.Product market competitive advantage is a form of value advantage, which enterprises can enhance through scientific research and development, process refinement, or by building a green, friendly, responsible, and benevolent image15. A company’s ESG performance is a key criterion for measuring its sustainable development level in the international community. Against the backdrop of improving corporate ESG performance, enterprises can enhance product competitiveness to secure more substantial profits.Corporate carbon emission risk is a crucial indicator for measuring environmental awareness in a company’s ESG performance. Enhanced environmental awareness and environmental label signals from the development of green finance help enterprises improve green governance and reduce carbon emission risks16. A reduction in corporate carbon emission risk signifies sound environmental performance, which enhances corporate competitive advantage, increases market share, and thereby boosts corporate value17. Conversely, an increase in corporate carbon emission risk reduces a company’s product market competitiveness, which in turn affects investors’ evaluation of the company’s value18subjecting it to a penalty in market value.

Finally, corporate carbon emission risk reduces corporate value by lowering the shareholding ratio of green investors.Corporate environmental performance is an objective reflection of a company’s environmental protection and governance efforts. Existing studies have used carbon dioxide emissions as an indicator of micro-enterprise environmental performance19. As China continues to advance green transformation, institutional investors—who possess high sensitivity and judgment regarding green policies—have begun to prefer investing in enterprises with better environmental performance; conversely, poor environmental performance reduces the shareholding ratio of institutional investors in a company.Existing research has confirmed the positive impact of institutional investors’ shareholding ratio on corporate value20. Based on the “exit threat” theory, institutional investors influence the investment behavior of retail investors, using their market-guiding role as leverage to issue exit threats to enterprises, thereby prompting management to take actions that maximize corporate value and shareholder wealth.Currently, some institutional investors have become green investors pursuing dual values of economic benefits and social utility, with a stronger focus on sustainable development in their investments. The growing scale of green investors’ shareholdings means that corporate management cannot ignore their suggestions21. When corporate carbon emission risk increases, it undermines the company’s green governance performance, reduces the shareholding ratio of green investors, and consequently lowers corporate value.

Hypothesis 1: The greater a firm’s carbon emissions, the lower its market value.

This study selects non-financial A-share listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2008 to 2022 as the research sample. The following exclusions are applied: companies classified as ST or ST*, companies newly listed or suspended in the year under study, firms with negative net assets, and those with missing data. After filtering, a final sample of 12,136 firm-year observations is obtained. The primary data sources include the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database and the Wind Financial Terminal. To mitigate the influence of outliers, all continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.

To examine the impact of corporate carbon emissions on firm market value, this study constructs the following empirical model (1). In Model (1), the dependent variable isTobin’s Q, and the key independent variable is the natural logarithm of carbon emissions (lnCO2). A significantly negative coefficient onlnCO2would indicate that higher corporate carbon emissions are associated with lower firm market value.

Following Bose et al.22this study uses the amount of carbon dioxide emissions as a proxy for corporate carbon emissions. The natural logarithm of CO₂ emissions is taken and denoted aslnCO2to measure the firm’s carbon emission level. Carbon emission data are derived from industry-level CO₂ emissions reported in the CSMAR financial database. Referring to the methodology of Ding et al.7firm-level CO₂ emissions are estimated based on industry-level carbon emissions and the firm’s operating costs. The specific calculation is shown in Eq. (2).

The core logic of this method—allocating industry emissions based on the proportion of operating costs—boasts both theoretical and practical rationality. On the one hand, operating costs are inherently linked to corporate energy consumption: expanded production scale and increased costs are often accompanied by higher energy input, and the carbon emission intensity per unit of operating cost remains relatively stable among enterprises within the same industry. This allows the proportion of operating costs to reasonably reflect an enterprise’s contribution ratio to industry emissions. On the other hand, compared with alternative methods—such as the conversion method that relies on unreported corporate energy expenditures, the output coefficient method applicable only to industries with standardized products, and the carbon footprint database method with extremely low coverage among Chinese enterprises—this method, which draws on industry-wide carbon emission data, not only effectively alleviates the practical constraint of insufficient disclosure of carbon emission data by Chinese enterprises but also ensures the scientificity of the estimation logic based on the intrinsic connection between operating costs and energy consumption. As such, it is more compatible with the actual characteristics of China’s current capital market.

Drawing on existing literature, this paper employs a commonly used indicator for measuring firm value—Tobin’s Q (TobinQ). Tobin’s Q is calculated as the ratio of (market value of tradable shares + book value of liabilities + number of non-tradable shares×net asset per share) to total assets. This indicator is widely used to evaluate a company’s performance; a higher value indicates better corporate performance and greater growth opportunities23. In China’s capital market, non-tradable shares cannot be traded on the secondary market, so their value cannot be directly reflected by the price of tradable shares. The use of “number of non-tradable shares×net asset per share” to calculate the value of non-tradable shares is based on two considerations: First, net asset per share objectively reflects the book equity value of an enterprise, is not affected by market speculative factors, and thus can stably measure the intrinsic value of non-tradable shares. Second, this method is a standard practice in domestic academic research for handling non-tradable shares, which ensures the comparability of Tobin’s Q values across enterprises with different ownership structures and avoids valuation biases caused by differences in share liquidity.

To control for other economic characteristic indicators that affect corporate value, this paper follows the approach of Lei Xintu et al.24and introduces the following control variables: firm size (Size), ownership concentration (Top1), total asset growth rate (Growth), asset-liability ratio (Lev), independent director structure (Indep), management shareholding ratio (Mshare), duality of chairman and CEO (Dual), firm age (AGE), regional environmental regulations (RER), and ownership type (SOE). The specific definitions and calculation methods of these control variables are detailed in (Table1).

Definitions and calculation methods of control variables.

Table2reports the descriptive statistics of the variables. The minimum value of corporate carbon emissions (lnCO2) is 7.360, and the maximum is 18.655, indicating a wide range and generally high levels of emissions among firms. The market value of firms (TobinQ) ranges from a minimum of 0.900 to a maximum of 7.090. Other indicators represent control variables, and their detailed descriptive statistics are shown in (Table2).

Calibration and descriptive statistics of variables.

To further prevent multicollinearity from interfering with the empirical results, this paper conducts a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test. A larger VIF value indicates more serious multicollinearity among variables. According to existing studies, a VIF value less than 5 can be considered to indicate no serious multicollinearity. The VIF test results of this paper are shown in Table3, with a maximum value of 1.780, a minimum value of 1.020, and an average value of 1.350. Therefore, there is no multicollinearity problem in this empirical study.

Table4reports the regression results of corporate carbon emission risk (lnCO2) on corporate value (TobinQ). Columns (1), (2), and (3) of Table4show the regression results according to model (1) without adding control variables, with control variables added, and with annual and company fixed effects added, respectively. The regression results indicate a significant negative correlation between carbon emission risk (lnCO2) and Tobin’s Q value (TobinQ), meaning that greater corporate carbon emission risks are associated with lower corporate value.

***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

This paper selects directly disclosed corporate carbon dioxide emissions (Co2emissions) as a proxy variable for measuring carbon emission risks. The results are shown in column (1) of (Table5). The coefficient of Co2emissions is significantly negative, which is basically consistent with the original results.

This paper selects the price-to-book ratio (PB) as a substitute variable for corporate value. The price-to-book ratio, i.e., the ratio of stock price to net asset per share, its core logic is to reflect the market’s valuation expectations of a company’s net asset quality and future profitability through the relative relationship between market price and the book value of corporate net assets. A higher price-to-book ratio (PB) indicates a higher market evaluation of corporate value. The results are shown in column (2) of (Table5). The coefficient of lnCO2 is significantly negative, which is basically consistent with the original results.

To avoid errors in multiple regression results caused by unobservable omitted variables, this paper conducts a placebo test by replacing the treatment group, randomly selecting 6,609 enterprises from the total sample as the hypothetical treatment group, and the remaining sample enterprises as the control group. This operation is repeated 500 times, and finally 500 estimated coefficients and their corresponding p-values are obtained. As shown in Fig.1, the regression coefficients follow a normal distribution and are mainly clustered around 0, with a small proportion of significantly positive and significantly negative coefficients. However, the actual estimated coefficient of carbon emission risk lnCO2 is -0.039, which is on the left side of the distribution of false regression coefficients and significantly different from the placebo test results. Therefore, the reduction in corporate value is indeed caused by carbon emission risks, not by other accidental factors or noise.

Referring to the study by Safiullah et al.25this paper selects the average carbon emission level of other listed companies in the same region and industry as the enterprise (IV_lnCO2peer) as an instrumental variable and uses the two-stage least squares method to test the endogeneity problem. The reasons are as follows: first, other enterprises in the same region and industry often face similar environmental policies, energy supply conditions, and production technology standards, and their average carbon emissions are naturally related to the carbon emissions of the target enterprise, which can effectively capture the common factors affecting corporate carbon emissions. Second, this indicator reflects the average emission level of other enterprises and is not affected by the value of the individual enterprise itself. The value fluctuation of a single enterprise can hardly change the overall emission level of other enterprises in the same region and industry. To further prove the exogeneity of the instrumental variable, this paper has included variables such as regional GDP and regional environmental regulations as control variables in the model. This time, this paper also selects industry carbon emission intensity (IV_Indensitydum) as another instrumental variable. The test results are shown in (Table6). Columns (1) and (3) are the first-stage regression results of the two-stage least squares 2SLS test. The results show that the regression coefficients of IV_lnCO2peer are significantly positive at the 1% level, indicating that the average carbon emission level of other listed companies in the same region and industry is positively correlated with corporate carbon emission risks. The regression coefficients of IV_Indensitydum are significantly positive at the 1% level, indicating that industry carbon emission intensity is positively correlated with corporate carbon emission risks. Columns (2) and (4) in the table are the second stage of the two-stage 2SLS test. According to the results, the regression coefficients of lnCO2 are significantly negative at the 1% level, indicating that carbon emission risks are negatively correlated with corporate value, which is consistent with the benchmark regression analysis results, proving the robustness of the conclusion.

In the theoretical analysis section, this paper hypothesizes that corporate carbon emission risk has a negative impact on corporate value. This is primarily because an increase in corporate carbon emission risk reduces the corporate risk-taking level, product market competitiveness, and the shareholding ratio of green investors, which in turn leads to a decline in corporate value. Therefore, this paper argues that the corporate risk-taking level, product market competitiveness, and the shareholding ratio of green investors are the main mechanisms through which corporate carbon emission risk affects corporate value.Drawing on Jiang Ting26this paper conducts mechanism tests by observing the impact of explanatory variables on mediating variables. Specifically, it constructs mediating mechanism models respectively and performs regressions with mediating variables as dependent variables and explanatory variables as independent variables.

Drawing on the methodology of He et al.27this study uses earnings volatility (PV) as a proxy for corporate risk-taking. Model (3) is developed to investigate the impact of carbon emissions on a firm’s willingness to bear risk. Higher earnings volatility indicates a greater risk-taking propensity. All other variables remain consistent with previous models.

The regression results, as shown in Column (1) of Table7, indicate that the coefficient of corporate carbon emission risk (lnCO2) is significantly negative at the 5% level. This suggests that an increase in corporate carbon emission risk reduces the corporate risk-taking level, which in turn affects corporate value. Thus, the mediating mechanism is validated.

Following the methodology of Li & Li28this paper uses the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) to measure the intensity of product market competition and constructs Model (4) to test the mediating effect. All other variables are consistent with previous models. The HHI is calculated as, whereandrepresents the operating revenue of firmi. A lower HHI indicates higher intensity of product market competition.

The regression results, as shown in Column (2) of Table7, indicate that the coefficient of corporate carbon emission risk (lnCO2) is significantly positive at the 1% level. This suggests that an increase in corporate carbon emission risk raises the HHI value, thereby reducing firms’ product market competitiveness and further lowering corporate value. Thus, the mediating mechanism is validated.

The regression results, as shown in Column (3) of Table7, indicate that the coefficient of corporate carbon emission risk (lnCO2) is significantly negative at the 1% level. This suggests that an increase in corporate carbon emission risk reduces the shareholding ratio of green investors, and further lowers corporate value. Thus, the mediating mechanism is validated.

Currently, numerous domestic and international studies have confirmed that agency costs have a negative impact on corporate value29. Environmental regulations, on the other hand, prompt listed companies to proactively reduce pollution, thereby lowering corporate agency costs. From the perspective of principal-agent theory, high agency costs imply that shareholders have weaker supervision and restraint capabilities over management, and management is more likely to pursue short-term operating performance while ignoring long-term environmental risks caused by carbon emissions (such as potential costs like future carbon taxes and environmental penalties). In such cases, high carbon emissions not only directly increase enterprises’ environmental liabilities but also expand risk exposure due to management’s lack of motivation for risk prevention and control. The market will anticipate that such enterprises struggle to effectively respond to carbon emission-related policy and market pressures, thus imposing a more severe discount on their value. Conversely, in enterprises with low agency costs, shareholders can urge management to balance short-term profits and long-term environmental responsibilities through more effective governance mechanisms (e.g., sound incentive and supervision systems), reducing the accumulation of carbon emission risks and thereby mitigating the impact on corporate value. Therefore, this paper predicts that the negative impact of corporate carbon emission risk on corporate value is greater in enterprises with high agency costs than in those with low agency costs.

Following Ma Ning30this paper uses management expense ratio and asset turnover ratio as indicators of agency costs, distinguishes the level of corporate agency costs based on their medians, and adopts a grouped regression method to further test the heterogeneity of the impact of corporate carbon emission risk on corporate value. Columns (1) and (3) of Table8represent enterprises with high agency costs, while Columns (2) and (4) represent those with low agency costs. The results show that the coefficients of the explanatory variables in Columns (1) and (3) are significantly negative at the 1% significance level; the coefficient in Column (2) is significantly negative at the 10% level; the coefficient in Column (4) is significantly negative at the 1% level; and the absolute value of the coefficient in Column (3) is larger than that in Column (4). The results of the inter-group difference test indicate that the coefficient differences between the two groups of samples are statistically significant. This suggests that the higher the agency cost, the more significant the negative impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value.

The impact of corporate carbon emissions on firm market value under different levels of agency costs.

Existing studies have confirmed that real earnings management behavior of enterprises harms corporate performance31. Real earnings management conceals the actual operating conditions of enterprises by manipulating operational activities (such as overproduction and cutting necessary expenditures), which essentially reduces enterprises’ information transparency. When enterprises have a high level of earnings management, investors find it difficult to accurately judge their real operating conditions and risk levels; meanwhile, carbon emission risk, as a negative environmental signal, will form a cumulative effect with information asymmetry: investors tend to overestimate potential losses because they cannot verify the actual exposure of enterprises’ carbon emission risk; at the same time, the opportunistic behavior in earnings management will strengthen the market’s perception that enterprises lack long-term responsibility, further weakening investors’ trust in enterprises’ ability to cope with carbon emission risk, and thus exacerbating the undervaluation of corporate value. Conversely, enterprises with low earnings management levels have higher information transparency, and the transmission of carbon emission risk is clearer. The market evaluates their value more rationally, and the negative impact is relatively weaker.

This paper uses abnormal operating cash flows (ACFO), abnormal discretionary expenses (ADISEXP), and abnormal production costs (APROD) to construct a composite indicator (REM) for measuring the degree of real earnings management through upward manipulation of earnings by enterprises.

Among them, discretionary accruals (DACCR) are estimated using the modified Jones model. DA represents the absolute value of discretionary accruals, and a larger value indicates a higher level of accrual earnings management.This paper conducts grouped regressions based on the medians of enterprises’ real earnings management level and accrual earnings management level, respectively, to further test the heterogeneity of the impact of corporate carbon emission risk on corporate value. Column (1) of Table9represents enterprises with a high level of real earnings management, Column (2) represents those with a low level of real earnings management, Column (3) represents enterprises with a high level of accrual earnings management, and Column (4) represents those with a low level of accrual earnings management. The results show that the coefficients of the explanatory variables in Columns (1), (2), (3), and (4) are all significantly negative at the 1% level; the absolute value of the coefficient in Column (1) is larger than that in Column (2), and the absolute value of the coefficient in Column (3) is larger than that in Column (4). The results of the inter-group difference test indicate that enterprises with a higher level of earnings management engage in more earnings manipulation, and in such enterprises, the impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value is greater.

The impact of corporate carbon emissions on firm market value under different levels of earnings management.

Existing studies have confirmed that the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility (CSR) can promote the improvement of corporate value33. Stakeholder theory points out that corporate value depends not only on shareholders’ interests but also on the demands of multiple subjects such as the environment, communities, and consumers, while good CSR performance is key to building stakeholders’ trust. For enterprises with poor CSR performance, they already respond inadequately to the demands of environmental stakeholders (e.g., environmental organizations, community residents). High carbon emissions will directly intensify the dissatisfaction of these groups, which may trigger consumer boycotts, protests from environmental organizations, or key inspections by regulatory authorities. This leads to a decline in market share and an increase in compliance costs, thereby amplifying the negative impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value. Conversely, enterprises with good CSR performance have accumulated a good reputation through continuous fulfillment of responsibilities, and their carbon emission risk can be partially mitigated through this “trust buffer”: stakeholders are more inclined to believe that enterprises have the willingness and ability to improve environmental performance (e.g., reducing emissions through technological upgrading), thus alleviating the negative evaluation of corporate value.

Drawing on the approach of Jia Xingping et al. (2014), this paper uses the total CSR score from Hexun’s listed companies’ social responsibility reports to measure the level of corporate social responsibility fulfillment. Based on the median of this score, enterprises are divided into two groups: those with high CSR scores (Column (1)) and those with low CSR scores (Column (2)). Grouped regressions are conducted to analyze the heterogeneity of the impact of corporate carbon emission risk on corporate value. According to the regression results in Table10, the coefficients of the explanatory variables in Columns (1) and (2) are both significantly negative at the 1% level, with significant inter-group differences. This indicates that the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility mitigates the negative correlation between corporate carbon emission risk and corporate value.

To further explore whether there is a nonlinear relationship between carbon emission risk and corporate value, this paper introduces the quadratic term (lnCO22) of corporate carbon emission risk (lnCO2) into the benchmark model, with the test results shown in (Table11). The coefficient of the first-order term of carbon emission risk (lnCO₂) is significantly negative, indicating that within a certain range, an increase in carbon emission risk has a significant negative impact on corporate value. The coefficient of the quadratic term (lnCO₂²), however, is significantly positive, suggesting a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between carbon emission risk and corporate value (TobinQ): when the level of carbon emission risk is low, the negative impact of increased carbon emission risk on corporate value strengthens as emissions rise; when carbon emission risk exceeds a certain “inflection point”, the negative impact gradually weakens and turns positive. Calculated using the nlcom command, the inflection point of the U-shaped relationship is 22.63. However, the actual carbon emission risk corresponding to this inflection point is far beyond the reasonable emission range of sample enterprises. This implies that: the carbon emission levels of most enterprises are below this inflection point, so the overall impact of carbon emissions on corporate value remains predominantly negative; only a very small number of extremely high-emission enterprises (e.g., leading enterprises in the heavy chemical industry and energy sector) may enter the “positive range”, where the inhibitory effect of increased emission risk on value is offset by technological upgrading, scale effects, or the ability to pass on carbon costs.

Stakeholder theory posits that corporate behaviors should balance the interests of multiple subjects, including shareholders and society. Under the goal of carbon neutrality34,35carbon emission risk, as a core indicator of environmental risk, affects corporate value through the pressure exerted by stakeholders. China’s carbon market pilot (launched in 2013) converts carbon emission costs from “implicit” to “explicit” through the establishment of a carbon emission quota trading mechanism (e.g., high-emission enterprises need to purchase quotas or face penalties), which strengthens stakeholders’ attention to corporate environmental responsibilities. For investors, the pilot policy turns carbon emissions into quantifiable financial risks (such as quota expenses and compliance costs), reducing the investment attractiveness of enterprises with high emission risks and leading to a discount in market valuation. For consumers and supply chains, the pilot policy enhances social recognition of “low carbon”, and products of enterprises with high emission risks may face market boycotts, further squeezing their value space. Therefore, this paper predicts that the policy may amplify the negative impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value through the constraint mechanism of stakeholders.

A comprehensive variable distinguishing policy implementation and pilot identity. It is assigned a value of 1 if the enterprise belongs to a carbon market pilot industry (specifically, the eight industries of petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, steel, nonferrous metals, papermaking, electric power, and aviation are identified as pilot industries for carbon emission rights trading) and the year is 2013 or later (after the policy was launched); otherwise, it is 0.The test results, as shown in Table12, indicate that the interaction term (lnCO₂ × DID) is significantly negative at the 1% level. This suggests that such a policy shock changes the intensity of the impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value, i.e., after the policy implementation, the inhibitory effect of high carbon emission risk on value in pilot enterprises may be more significant than that before the policy implementation and in non-pilot enterprises.

Analysis of the impact of china’s carbon market pilot policy.

Against the backdrop of global climate governance, China actively participates in global environmental governance and fulfills its carbon emission reduction obligations. This paper uses data from non-financial A-share listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2008 to 2018, and empirically examines the relationship between corporate carbon emission risk and corporate value, as well as its impact path, under the context of China’s carbon emission reduction policies. The research focuses on three dimensions: first, empirically verifying the negative impact of corporate carbon emission risk on corporate value based on China’s institutional context, and ensuring the reliability of conclusions through multiple robustness tests; second, analyzing the mediating roles of risk-taking level, product market competitiveness, and green investors’ shareholding ratio to clarify the transmission logic of the relationship between the two; third, exploring the moderating effects of corporate characteristics such as agency costs, earnings management, and corporate social responsibility to identify the context dependence of the impact of carbon emission risk.

Second, the exploration of the heterogeneity of the value effect of carbon emission risk provides new ideas for enterprises to improve internal control quality and realize transformation and development. It can be inferred from the research results that reducing agency costs and regulating earnings management behaviors can mitigate the negative impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value; at the same time, enterprises’ active response to global environmental governance, proactive fulfillment of social responsibilities, and meeting green consumption demands can also alleviate this negative effect. Therefore, enterprises should incorporate “low-carbon development” into their internal control systems, pay attention to policy orientations and implementation, and promote the realization of the goal of maximizing corporate value on the basis of conforming to China’s inherent needs for sustainable development.

This paper does not fully consider corporate carbon management strategies as a key variable. Proactive carbon management behaviors (e.g., R&D on carbon reduction technologies, carbon information disclosure) may mitigate the negative impact of carbon emission risk on corporate value. For instance, firms actively disclosing carbon information can enhance investor trust through signaling effects, offsetting the negative impact of high carbon emissions; in contrast, firms without carbon management may face more severe value losses. Omitting such variables may bias the model’s estimation of the impact of carbon emission risk, making it difficult to fully reveal the boundary conditions of their relationship.

The sample of this paper only includes non-financial A-share listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. However, listed and non-listed firms differ significantly in governance structures, financing capabilities, and policy constraints. Listed firms face stricter information disclosure requirements and market supervision, so their motivation to address carbon emission risk is generally higher than that of non-listed firms. For non-listed firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, the mechanism and intensity of carbon emission risk’s impact on corporate value may differ due to pressure from emission reduction costs or variations in policy enforcement. Thus, the conclusions of this paper cannot be directly generalized to non-listed firms, limiting the study’s universality.

With the improvement of corporate carbon information disclosure systems (e.g., the implementation of the Environmental Information Disclosure Guidelines by the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges), future studies can use self-disclosed corporate carbon emission data or third-party carbon verification data to replace the current estimation method, re-examining the relationship between carbon emission risk and corporate value. Additionally, comparing results from estimated and actual data can quantify the impact of measurement errors on research conclusions, enhancing their robustness.

Future research can construct a “carbon emission risk-carbon management strategy-corporate value” moderation model to examine the role of specific carbon management measures. For example, analyzing the buffering effects of variables such as investment in carbon reduction technologies (e.g., number of green patents) and quality of carbon information disclosure (e.g., completeness and authenticity of disclosure) in their relationship can clarify the specific paths through which high-carbon-emission firms reduce value losses via proactive management, providing more operational suggestions for corporate carbon governance practices.
