The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is an established and validated outcome measure of knee arthroplasty (KA), but it is not clear how responses to each of the 12 questions relate to satisfaction. The aim was to assess which of 12 OKS questions were associated with patient satisfaction after KA.

This single-centre retrospective cohort study was conducted over an eight-year period from January 2014 to December 2021. A total of 3,361 patients completed preoperative and six months postoperative OKS. The mean age was 69.9 years (34 to 94, SD 9.3), and 1,792 were female (55.0%). Patient satisfaction with their KA was assessed at six months, which was categorized into satisfied (satisfied, very satisfied) and dissatisfied (neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied).

All 12 questions demonstrated significant improvements postoperatively (p < 0.001), with moderate (q2/3/7) to large (q1/4/5/6/8/9/10/11/12) effect sizes. There were 2,704 patients (82.9%) who were satisfied with their KA at six months. Satisfied patients had significantly greater improvements (p < 0.001) in each of the OKS questions, with the greatest differences found in questions 6 (limping; mean difference (MD) 1.41 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.53)) and 1 (pain; MD 1.32 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.42)). Preoperative responses to each of the OKS questions demonstrated poor discriminatory ability to predict patient satisfaction (area under the curve < 0.70). Improvement in questions 1 (pain; odds ratio (OR) 1.72 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.96), p < 0.001), 6 (limping; OR 1.28 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.41), p < 0.001), 7 (kneeling; OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.35), p = 0.003), 8 (night pain; OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.23), p = 0.038), 9 (working; OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39), p = 0.015), and 12 (stairs; OR 1.42 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.63), p < 0.001) were independently associated with satisfaction.

Improvements in six of the 12 OKS questions were independently associated with patient satisfaction; these could be prioritized as areas to be addressed following KA, and modification of related patient expectations may improve satisfaction with surgery.

The aims of the study were to assess which of 12 OKS questions were associated with patient satisfaction after KA.

This study was classed as a service evaluation and did not meet the criteria requiring ethical approval. Ethical approval was obtained for data collection and analysis (Scotland B REC, number 20/SS/0125 A), and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines for good clinical practice.18,19This single-centre retrospective cohort study was conducted over an eight-year period from January 2014 to December 2021. The study centre has an established arthroplasty register that prospectively records patient demographics and routine pre- and postoperative PROMs. Patients undergoing primary KA for arthritis and who completed a pre- and postoperative OKS were included. Patients undergoing revision were excluded.

The OKS was administered preoperatively and at six months postoperatively via a postal questionnaire. Patients who did not return the questionnaire, or had missing responses to specific questions, were routinely contacted via telephone to complete the OKS. This has been shown to be a valid way to collect the OKS.20The responses to each of the OKS questions were scored from 0 to 4.3,4A summative score of 48 is the best possible score (least symptomatic) and 0 is the worst possible score (most symptomatic).

During the study period, 3,261 patients completed 12 questions of their pre- and postoperative OKS at six months. There were 501 who had completed the preoperative questionnaire but were lost to follow-up. There were differences in age (p = 0.871, independent-samplest-test), sex (p = 0.999, chi-squared test), and preoperative OKS (p = 0.511, independent-samplest-test) between those lost to follow-up and the study cohort. There were 1,792 females (55.0%) and the overall mean age was 69.9 years (34 to 94, SD 9.3).

Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17.0 (SPSS, USA). Simple descriptive analysis was undertaken according to mean and SD for pre- and postoperative responses for each question. Effect size (mean change/SD) was also calculated for each question, and effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 were considered ‘small’, ‘medium’, and ‘large’ effect, respectively.21Paired and independent-samplest-tests were used to compare parametric continuous variables within and between groups, respectively. A chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables between groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the predictive value of responses to preoperative and improvement postoperatively at six months for patient satisfaction. This is reported as an area under the curve (AUC), where 0.5 equates to no discrimination, 0.5 to 0.7 has poor discrimination, 0.7 to 0.8 has acceptable discrimination, 0.8 to 0.9 has excellent discrimination, and more than 0.9 has outstanding discrimination.22Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent variables (OKS questions) associated with patient satisfaction with their KA six months following surgery. A p-value of < 0.05 was defined as significant in the regression model. However, a p-value of < 0.010 was defined as significant for unadjusted analysis to account for multiple testing.

The mean preoperative OKS for the total cohort was 20.9 (SD 7.7), which improved to 34.5 (SD 9.4) six months postoperatively, which was significant (mean difference (MD) 13.9, 95% CI 13.3 to 13.9, p < 0.001, pairedt-test). All 12 questions demonstrated significant (p < 0.001, pairedt-test) improvements postoperatively and a moderate to large effect sizes (Table I), with question 6 demonstrating the greatest improvement (MD 1.87, 95% CI 1.82 to 1.92) and question 1 having the largest effect size (1.44).

Independently associated with patient satisfaction with their knee arthroplasty at six months.

There were 557 patients (17.1%) who were not satisfied with their KA at six months. There were no differences in sex (odds ratio (OR) 1.11 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.32), p = 0.249, chi-squared test), age (MD 0.8 (95% CI -0.1 to 1.6), p = 0.073, independent-samplest-test), or BMI (MD 0.1 (95% CI -0.4 to 0.7), p = 0.596, independent-samplest-test) between satisfied and dissatisfied patients. Satisfied patients had a significantly (p < 0.001, independent-samplest-test) greater improvement in each of the OKS questions postoperatively relative to their preoperative baseline (Table II). The greatest differences were observed in questions 6 (limping; MD 1.41 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.53)) and 1 (pain; MD 1.32 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.42)).

Mean for each of the 12 Oxford Knee Score questions according to group.

Preoperative responses to each of the OKS questions demonstrated poor discriminatory ability to predict patient satisfaction following surgery, with AUCs of less than 0.70 (Table IIIandFigure 1), whereas postoperative improvements in questions 3 (transport), 5 (standing), 6 (limping), 7 (kneeling), 8 (night pain), 9 (working), 11 (shopping), and 12 (stairs) were acceptable, and question 1 (pain) was an excellent discriminator of patient satisfaction following surgery, with an AUC of more than 0.70 (Table IIIandFigure 2).

Direct logistic regression analysis was undertaken to assess the impact of change in each of the 12 OKS questions at six months on the likelihood that patients would be satisfied with their KA. The model contained improvement in each of 12 OKS questions and was statistically significant (chi-squared test = 858.0, p < 0.001), indicating the ability to distinguish between satisfied and dissatisfied patients. Age and sex, when included in the model, were not significantly associated with patient satisfaction and were excluded from further analysis. The model as a whole explained between 23% (Cox and Snell R squared) and 39% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in the pain status and correctly classified 95.4% (n = 2,578/2,701) of the satisfied patients. Hosmer and Lemeshow test was not significant (p = 0.097) and supports the goodness of fit of the model. Improvement in questions 1 (pain; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.96, p < 0.001), 6 (limping; OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.41, p < 0.001), 7 (kneeling; OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.35, p = 0.003), 8 (night pain; OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23, p = 0.038), 9 (working; OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.39, p = 0.015), and 12 (stairs; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.63, p < 0.001) were all independently associated with patient satisfaction with their KA at six months (Table IV).

This study has shown that improvement in six of 12 OKS questions was independently associated with patient satisfaction with their KA at six months, with improvements in pain and stair descent having the greatest effect on satisfaction. Of these six questions, five (pain, limping, night pain, working, stairs) had large effect sizes and one (kneeling) had moderate effect sizes, suggesting less of an improvement in kneeling following KA. Preoperative responses to each of the OKS questions were not associated with postoperative patient satisfaction, whereas improvements in eight of the OKS questions were acceptable discriminators of patient satisfaction following surgery, and question 1 in relation to pain was the only excellent discriminator.

There were several limitations of this retrospective study that should be acknowledged. The cohort was reported as a combined single group, and the responses to the individual questions may be different according to patient demographics such as age and sex, for example.23However, when age and sex were included in the regression model, they were significant factors and the model remained unchanged. The study did not include additional patient variables such as the presence of comorbidities, which has been demonstrated to be associated with lower rates of postoperative patient satisfaction with their arthroplasty.24-27Furthermore, surgical variables such as patella resurfacing,28implant design,29implant alignment,30or health-related quality of life measures such as the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D)31were not adjusted for in the model, and therefore the findings may not be independent of such variables. This may in part account for the fact that the OKS questions only predicted 22% to 35% of the variation in the model, with the remainder being due to other variables. However, the model correctly classified 95% of those patients who were satisfied. The intended aim of the study was to identify which of the 12 individual OKS questions were associated with patient satisfaction with their KA, which is why the authors chose to only include the questions in the model. Finally, the study did not include radiological assessment of either the preoperative severity of the arthritis or the joint alignment postoperatively, both of which have been shown to influence joint-specific function.32,33While this study identifies which OKS questions are associated with patient satisfaction following KA, it has not explored the development or validation of a tool to assess knee score. We acknowledge that the development of this would be a future step and application of this study.

The OKS is a commonly employed tool in assessing the improvement of joint-specific symptoms following KA, and a mean improvement of approximately 15 points is observed following KA.34There is a well-established association between improvement in the mean OKS and postoperative patient satisfaction,11,15but it is not clear how each of the 12 OKS questions relates to patient satisfaction. Moreover, the clinically important improvement in the OKS has been defined as a mean improvement of seven points or more,35but the contribution of the 12 individual questions to achieve this value has not been explored. The improvement in each of the 12 OKS questions varies from 0.7 (washing) to 2.2 (limping) points after KA, suggesting that patients experience different improvements in their symptoms according to the 12 questions following KA, despite having equal weighting.8Previously, authors have divided the OKS into pain and functional components, and have shown that improvements in these two subdivisions are related to different patient variables.36Scott et al12identified that patient satisfaction was not independently related to improvement in the functional sub-score of the OKS (questions 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12) but was related to the pain sub-score (questions 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9). In contrast, the current study found that questions from both the pain (questions 1, 8, and 9) and functional (6, 7, and 12) sub-scores of the OKS were independently associated with patient satisfaction. However, the current study assessed the independence of each of the 12 OKS questions, and therefore suggests that the three pain and three functional questions assess different aspects of the individual’s outcome and satisfaction with their KA.

The rate of satisfaction ranges from 80% to 100%,9,10with multiple pre- and postoperative factors influencing this.10Previous authors have investigated whether the preoperative OKS is associated with postoperative satisfaction and demonstrated no significant predictive association.37,38This finding is consistent with the current study, which found the individual responses to each of the 12 OKS questions to be poor discriminators of postoperative patient satisfaction with their KA. Pronk et al39is one of the few studies to demonstrate that preoperative function, using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score,40was predictive of patient satisfaction, but despite being statistically significant it was not a reliable predictor (< 7%). Improvement in the OKS postoperatively is associated with patient satisfaction,11and has been used to define the minimal clinically important difference.35,41The current study found that improvement in question 1 of the OKS, relating to usual pain in the knee, was the most reliable discriminator of patient satisfaction with an AUC of 81%. Judge et al42assessed the improvement in the total OKS at six months and demonstrated an AUC of 80% for predicting patient satisfaction with their KA. This suggests that improvement in a single question in the OKS postoperatively is more predictive than when all 12 OKS are employed. This may be due to some of the OKS questions (2, 4, and 10) being poor discriminators of patient satisfaction, and this reduces the predictive ability of total OKS.

The current study demonstrated that questions 1 (usual pain), 6 (limping), 7 (kneeling), 8 (night pain), 9 (interferes with work), and 12 (stair descent) were independently associated with patient satisfaction. Question 6 in relation to kneeling improved less (moderate effect size) compared to questions 1, 6, 9, and 12 that showed large effect sizes. This suggests that KA addressed kneeling to a lesser degree. Potentially addressing symptoms related to kneeling through modification of patient expectations of their KA may improve patient satisfaction with KA.43Focused physiotherapy to address this area postoperatively may also help to improve satisfaction.44In the knowledge that six of the 12 OKS questions are independently related to patient satisfaction, there may be scope to consider reducing the OKS to a shorter version including these six questions, which seem to be important to patients and their satisfaction. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome score has been reduced from 42 questions to seven to assess ‘knee health’, which has been validated to assess the outcome of KA.45This may help to improve the efficiency of administration and reduce patient questionnaire burden.

In conclusion, improvements in six of the 12 OKS questions were independently associated with patient satisfaction, and these could be prioritized as areas to be addressed following KA; modification of related patient expectations may improve satisfaction with surgery.
