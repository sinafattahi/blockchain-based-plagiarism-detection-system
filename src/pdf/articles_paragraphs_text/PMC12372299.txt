Personalized protein corona significantly influences the biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of nanomedicines, generating unique profiles that can impact treatment outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) exhibits increased tumor accumulation and enhanced antitumor immunity in obese mice bearing ovarian tumor, inducing a greater capacity to inhibit tumor growth compared to normal mice. Mechanistically, the protein corona, particularly enriched with complement component 1q (C1q) in the plasma of obese mice, significantly enhances the internalization of PLD by ovarian cancer cells and elicits strong immunogenic cell death (ICD) effects. Concurrently, C1q adsorbed on PLD promotes the engulfment of apoptotic tumor cells by dendritic cells (DCs), activating T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses and amplifying the overall antitumor efficacy of PLD in obese mice. Our findings provide new insights into the role of the personalized protein corona in modulating the therapeutic response to chemotherapy and highlight the potential of targeting C1q for enhancing the efficacy of nanomedicines in cancer treatment.

Nanomedicines hold significant promise in enhancing cancer chemotherapy due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects [1,2]. However, their clinical benefits have not yet shown substantial superiority over traditional treatments [3,4]. A key challenge is the inadequate tumor targeting of chemotherapeutic agents [5], leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes and considerable side effects [6,7]. Additionally, responses to these nanomedicines vary widely among individuals, with patient-specific factors such as gender [8], age [9] and body mass index (BMI) [10] influencing drug effectiveness. Thus, enhancing the precision of tumor targeting and elucidating the mechanisms behind individual responses to nanomedicines are crucial for boosting the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

Nanomedicines, once in the bloodstream, adsorb proteins from the surrounding media to form protein corona through electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions [11,12]. This protein corona can alter the physicochemical properties of nanomedicines, thereby affecting their pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy [13,14]. For example, the adsorption of opsonins such as IgG can promote phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and the eventual removal of nanomedicines from systemic circulation, while the adsorption of functional proteins such as albumin can enable active tumor targeting [15]. The composition of plasma proteins in patients with different pathological status might be different, leading to significant alterations in the protein corona composition on the nanoparticle surface (named as personalized protein corona) and generating different therapeutic efficacy [16,17]. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of personalized protein corona can elucidate the mechanism on different therapeutic efficacy of the same nanomedicines and serve as a potential tool for advancing personalized nanomedicines or overcoming limitations in the clinical translation of nanoparticle-based therapies.

Obesity, characterized by a BMI of 30 kg m−2or higher, is a global epidemic and a significant risk factor for at least 13 types of cancer, including ovarian cancer [18,19]. It often triggers inflammation and elevates levels of leptin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can drive tumor development and progression [20,21]. Interestingly, despite its role in promoting tumorigenesis, recent clinical analyses have revealed a paradoxical association between obesity and improved cancer therapeutic outcomes [22,23]. Obese patients tend to show better responses to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy [24,25]. For example, retrospective analyses of ovarian cancer patient data have revealed that obese patients have higher progression-free survival rates after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as PLD, paclitaxel, and carboplatin [24]. However, the mechanisms underlying this enhanced therapeutic efficacy in obese patients remain to be fully understood.

Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in the female reproductive system, with chemotherapy being a primary treatment [26]. However, unsatisfactory treatment efficacy and chemotherapy-related side effects significantly impact patients’ quality of life [27]. While emerging chemotherapy-related drugs, including chemokinetic therapeutic agents [28], immunotherapeutic agents [29,30], and aptamer drugs [31], show promise, their clinical translation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that PLD exhibits stronger anticancer activity in obese mice with ovarian tumors compared to normal mice. PLD adsorbs complement component 1q (C1q), a key component of the classical complement activation pathway [32,33], from the serum of obese mice, which facilitates its uptake by tumor cells expressing high levels of C1q receptors [34], thereby efficiently killing tumor cells. Furthermore, C1q adsorbed on PLD promotes the phagocytosis of released tumor antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) via DC-SIGN receptor [35], activating DC maturation and T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses and significantly enhancing the anticancer efficacy of PLD in obese mice (Scheme1). This work highlights a potential mechanism for leveraging personalized protein corona to enhance PLD efficacy and offering a more realistic and clinically translatable approach compared to other nanomedicines.

To assess the impact of obesity on chemotherapeutic efficacy, a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model was first developed by administering a high-fat diet (60% fat diet) to female C57BL/6 mice [36]. Concurrently, a control group was maintained on a normal-fat diet (10% fat diet) over the same period. After 13 weeks, the DIO mice gained more than 20% of their initial body weight (Fig.S1A and B) and exhibited a significant increase in Lee’s index, an indicator of obesity calculated as weight1/3/Naso-Anal length [37], compared to the normal mice (Fig.S1C). Additionally, the DIO mice had significantly more gonadal and inguinal fat pads than the control group (Fig.S1D), with a 8.6-fold increase in gonadal fat (Fig.S1E) and a 11.4-fold increase in inguinal fat (Fig.S1F). Blood biochemistry analyses also revealed that the DIO group had substantially higher levels of glucose (Fig.S1G), cholesterol (Fig.S1H), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, Fig.S1I) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, Fig.S1J) compared to normal mice. These findings collectively verify the successful creation of the DIO model.

Clinical data have indicated that ovarian cancer patients with a BMI over 30 exhibit improved survival rates following PLD [24]. To determine if the obese mice showed a similar response, ID8 ovarian cancer subcutaneous tumor models were established in both normal and DIO mice. These mice were treated with PLDviatail vein injection. The particle size, zeta potential and drug loading of PLD were 81.0 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. S2A), − 1.1 ± 0.1 mV and 11.1%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images revealed that PLD has a homogeneous spherical structure (Fig. S2B). Although obesity is generally associated with increased ovarian cancer growth, the DIO mice demonstrated a more effective tumor suppression effect after PLD treatment (Fig.1A). Specifically, PLD treatment led to a 74% reduction in tumor weight in obese mice, a significantly greater decrease compared to the normal mice group (Fig.1B). Additionally, the survival period for the PLD-treated obese mice was extended to 44 days, which was notably longer than the 34 days observed in the PLD-treated normal mice group (Fig.1C). These data suggest that obesity might enhance the effectiveness of PLD treatment in ovarian cancer. Specifically, PLD treatment was found to induce cardiotoxicity in the normal group of mice, as demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of key organs (Fig. S3), serological analysis (Fig. S4) and reduced body weight (Fig. S5). In contrast, obesity appeared to reduce the systemic toxicity associated with PLD (Fig. S3-S5), confirming a protective role of obesity against the adverse effects of chemotherapy [38].

To determine the potential mechanism by which obesity enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of PLD in ovarian cancer, we first assessed the in vivo biodistribution of PLD in normal and DIO mice bearing ID8 ovarian tumors by intravenously injecting CellVue®Claret-labeled PLD. Whole-animal fluorescence imaging analyses demonstrated a significant increase in CellVue®Claret fluorescence intensity in tumor tissues of the DIO mice compared to normal mice (Fig.1D and E). Whole-animal fluorescence imaging analyses showed a significant increase in CellVue®Claret fluorescence intensity in tumor tissues of DIO mice compared to normal mice (Fig.1D and E). Ex vivo imaging of tumor tissues 24 h after intravenous injection further revealed the enhanced accumulation of PLD in tumors of DIO mice (Fig. S6A and B). To further confirm the enhanced tumor accumulation of PLD in obese mice, PLD at a DOX dosage of 80µg per mouse were intravenously injected. 24 h after injection, the DOX content in major organs, including hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, kidneys and tumor tissues, was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PLD accumulation in tumor tissues of DIO mice was approximately 3.5-fold higher than in normal mice, although no significant difference was detected in other tissues (Fig.1E), suggesting that obesity may facilitate the delivery of PLD to ovarian tumors. Additionally, the tumor immune microenvironment was assessed in normal and DIO mice bearing ID8 tumors following intravenous injection of PLD bi-daily for a total of 3 times. Consistently, PLD treatment significantly increased the number of mature DCs, identified as CD11c+CD80+CD86+, in tumors of DIO mice compared with that of normal mice (Fig.1G), revealing that PLD efficiently promoted intratumoral DC maturation in DIO mice. Moreover, the DIO group exhibited a significant upregulation in the numbers of CD8+T cells (Fig.1H), as well as functional CD8+CD69+T cells (Fig.1I) and proliferating CD8+Ki67+T cells (Fig.1J) in tumors after PLD treatment. Meanwhile, the highest percentages of CD8+T cells expressing key effector molecules, including interleukin (IL)−2 (Fig.1K) which promotes T cell proliferation and differentiation, interferon (IFN)-γ(Fig.1L) which enhances antigen presentation and T cell activation; and granzyme B (GzmB) (Fig.1M) which directly induces tumor cell apoptosis, were observed in PLD-treated DIO mice [39]. Altogether, these results indicated that obesity can alter the tumor immune microenvironment in response to chemotherapy, leading to an enhanced therapeutic response to chemotherapy.

Protein corona significantly influences the in vivo transport processing of nanoparticles, thereby affecting their biological function. Given that PLD had different anticancer effects when administered to normal and DIO mice, it promotes our hypothesis that distinct protein coronas formed around PLD might modulate its in vivo behavior. To test this, we generated PLD with adsorbed protein coronas by incubating PLD with plasma from normal or DIO mice in vitro (denoted as PLD@NP and PLD@DP, respectively). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that both PLD@NP and PLD@DP exhibited a significant increase in diameter (Fig.2A) and a shift in zeta potential from nearly neutral to negatively charged (Fig.2B) compared to PLD alone, indicating successful adsorption of plasma proteins onto PLD, a phenomenon also confirmed in other studies [40,41]. However, the diameter and zeta potential of PLD@NP and PLD@DP were comparable (Fig.2A and B). Although PLD@NP and PLD@DP adsorbed the same amount of plasma proteins, the specific plasma protein species adsorbed onto their surfaces were significantly different, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig.2C). Additionally, we recovered and isolated PLD directly from the plasma of normal and DIO mice that had undergone intravenous PLD administration to obtain PLD@NP and PLD@DP. Consistently, PLD@NP and PLD@DP obtained in vivo showed similar diameter (Fig. S7A), zeta potential (Fig. S7B) and protein contents (Fig. S7C), but displayed different protein profiles (Fig. S7D). These findings indicated that the protein corona might be involved in regulating the efficacy of chemotherapy and the tumor microenvironment in DIO mice.

To ascertain the role of protein corona in the modulation of antitumor efficacy of PLD, ID8 cells were first treated with PLD@NP or PLD@DP at 37 °C for 4 h, after which intracellular DOX fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry. Expectedly, PLD@DP demonstrated greater internalization into ID8 cells than PLD@NP (Fig.2D and Fig. S8). Accordingly, PLD@DP exhibited stronger cytotoxicity against ID8 cells compared to PLD@NP (Fig.2E). Consistently, PLD@DP treatment resulted in enhanced exposure of calreticulin (CRT) (Fig.2F) and increased release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Fig.2G) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) (Fig.2H) in ID8 cells compared to PLD@NP, suggesting that PLD@DP induced a more potent immunogenic cell death (ICD) effects in ID8 cells. When ID8 cells treated with PLD@NP or PLD@DP were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), the PLD@DP-treated group exhibited a higher level of BMDC maturation compared to the PLD@NP-treated group (Fig.2I). Additionally, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that when naïve T cells were co-incubated with BMDCs treated with PLD@DP, there was a significant increase in the percentage of CD8+T cells producing effector molecules IL-2 (Fig.2J), GzmB (Fig.2K) and IFN-γ(Fig.2L), indicating that BMDCs matured by tumor cells treated with PLD@DP have a stronger capacity to activate CD8+T cells. However, we noticed that PLD@NP and PLD@DP did not remarkably affect cell viability of BMDCs (Fig. S9) at the used DOX concentration, suggesting that PLD@NP and PLD@DP do not exert cytotoxicity against BMDCs. These data collectively indicated that the protein corona, particularly that derived from DIO mice, significantly influenced the antitumor activity of PLD by enhancing its internalization into tumor cells and promoting a more effective antitumor immune response.

To further investigate the specific proteins influencing the in vivo behavior of PLD, we analyzed the protein components of PLD@NP and PLD@DP using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and referenced the Protein Data Bank. Identification of all proteins revealed that PLD@NP and PLD@DP mainly recruited proteins with smaller molecular weights (10–60 kDa) (Fig.3A). A volcano plot was used to depict these differences (Fig.3B), and a Venn diagram highlighted the distinctions in adsorbed proteins between PLD@NP and PLD@DP. With a threshold of fold change > 1.2 andP≤ 0.05, a total of 102 differentially expressed proteins were detected (Fig.3C). Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis revealed that the differential proteins adsorbed on PLD@DP were predominantly associated with human diseases and organismal systems pathways, particularly those related to the immune system (Fig.3D). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the top twenty differential protein pathways showed that the “complement and coagulation cascades” pathway had the highest number of differential proteins, indicating that PLD@DP adsorbed more complement system-related proteins than PLD@NP (Fig.3E). Among the complement proteins, C1q exhibited the most significant change, with a 2.4-fold increase in adsorption on PLD@DP compared to PLD@NP (Fig.3F). Consistently, ELISA assay confirmed higher C1q levels in the plasma of DIO mice than in normal mice (Fig. S10). At 100µg DOX, PLD@DP adsorbed 236µg of C1q protein, while PLD@NP adsorbed 189µg of C1q protein (Fig.3G), confirming a significant increase in C1q content on PLD@DP compared to PLD@NP. These findings revealed that PLD@DP-adsorbed proteins, especially C1q, might modulate the biological activity of PLD in DIO mice.

C1q, a hexameric molecule consisting of a spherical head (gC1q) and a collagenous tail (cC1q), binds to two distinct receptors, gC1qR and CRT (Fig.4A), respectively [34]. gC1qR is highly expressed on tumor cells [34]. To determine if C1q on PLD enhanced tumor targeting by binding to gC1qR on tumor cells of DIO mice, we created ID8 cells with stable gC1qR knockdown (ID8KOcells) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig.4B and Fig. S11). DIO mice were implanted with ID8 or ID8KOcells subcutaneously and then treated with PLDviatail vein injection. Tumor accumulation of PLD was assessed 24 h post-injection. As expected, knocking down gC1qR significantly reduced PLD accumulation in tumors of DIO mice (Fig.4C), highlighting C1q’s role in obesity-mediated tumor targeting of PLD.

To verify this, ID8 and ID8KOcells were treated with PLD@NP or PLD@DP, and then intracellular DOX content was determined. Consistently, more PLD@DP was internalized into ID8 cells than PLD@NP. The knockdown of gC1qR significantly decreased the internalization of PLD@DP, but not PLD@NP, into ID8 cells (Fig.4D and Fig. S12), indicating that C1q facilitated the uptake of PLD@DP by ID8 cells. Correspondingly, the knockdown of gC1qR also significantly mitigated the cytotoxicity of PLD@DP against ID8 cells (Fig.4E). Moreover, ID8KOcells exhibited reduced CRT exposure (Fig.4F) and decreased release of ATP (Fig.4G) and HMGB1 (Fig.4H) following PLD@DP treatment compared to ID8 cells, while PLD@NP treatment resulted in similar CRT exposure and HMGB1 and ATP release in both ID8 and ID8KOcells (Fig.4F-H), suggesting that gC1qR deletion specifically diminished ICD effects induced by PLD@DP. Furthermore, fewer PLD@DP-treated ID8KOcells were phagocytosed by BMDCs (Fig.4I and J), resulting in reduced maturation of BMDCs induced by PLD@DP (Fig.4K). Additionally, when naïve T cells were co-cultured with these BMDCs, those matured from PLD@DP-treated ID8 cells showed significantly higher numbers of CD8+T (Fig.4L), CD8+CD69+T (Fig.4M), CD8+IL-2+T (Fig.4N), CD8+GzmB+T (Fig.4O) and CD8+IFN-γ+T cells (Fig.4P) than those from PLD@DP-treated ID8KOcells. Collectively, these results revealed that C1q significantly influenced the targeting of PLD to tumor cells, potentially modulating the antitumor immune response to exert anticancer effects induced by PLD. To further substantiate the role of C1q in regulating tumor cell targeting of PLD, we used adiponectin (ADPN), a protein containing a C1q globular head structure that can compete with C1q [42]. ID8 cells were pretreated with PBS or ADPN, followed by treatment with PLD@NP or PLD@DP. Expectedly, ADPN pretreatment significantly decreased cellular uptake of PLD@DP (Fig. S13A and Fig. S14) and inhibited its cytotoxicity against ID8 cells (Fig. S13B). Additionally, ADPN pretreatment efficiently abolished PLD@DP-triggered ICD effects in ID8 cells (Fig. S13C-S13E) and the subsequent T cell-mediated antitumor immune response (Fig. S13F-S13I). In summary, the findings collectively highlight that C1q is a key regulator in directing tumor cell targeting and shaping the immune response elicited by PLD.

A hallmark of ICD is the CRT exposure on the surface of tumor cells, which serves as a receptor for cC1q [43]. Immature DCs express DC-SIGN on their surface, which binds gC1q [35]. When C1q binds to apoptotic tumor cells, C1q increases DC uptake of apoptotic tumor cells and promotes T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity by binding to DC-SIGN [35,44]. To investigate the role of C1q in the phagocytosis of PLD-induced apoptotic cells by DCs, DiO-labeled PLD-triggered apoptotic ID8 cells were pretreated with PBS or ani-C1q antibody (denoted as αC1q), which specifically binds to the cC1q segment of C1q to inhibit the interaction of C1q and CRT. Subsequently, these cells were treated with PLD@NP or PLD@DP and then co-incubating with BMDCs. As anticipated, BMDCs showed increased phagocytosis of DiO-labeled apoptotic ID8 cells following exposure to PLD@DP compared to PLD@NP (Fig.5A and B). Pretreatment with αC1q significantly diminished the enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic ID8 cells by BMDCs induced by PLD@DP (Fig.5A and B), while no significant changes were observed in PLD@DP-treated group. These findings suggested that the presence of C1q on PLD@DP was essential for the enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells by DCs. Furthermore, αC1q significantly reduced the maturation of BMDCs enhanced by PLD@DP (Fig.5C). When these BMDCs were co-cultured with splenic T cells, the PLD@DP-treated group exhibited higher frequencies of IL-2+(Fig.5D), GzmB+(Fig.5E) and IFN-γ+cells (Fig.5F) within CD8+T cells compared to PLD@NP-treated group. In contrast, αC1q significantly decreased PLD@DP-triggered CD8+T cell activation (Fig.5D-F). Collectively, these results indicated that C1q on PLD@DP contributed to the phagocytosis of PLD-induced apoptotic tumor cells by DCs, leading to increased DC maturation and CD8+T cell activation.

To delve deeper into how C1q influences the antitumor effects and immune reactions triggered by PLD in obese mice, DIO mice that had either subcutaneous ID8 tumors or ID8KOtumors were were subjected to treatments with PBS or PLD in the presence or absence of αC1q (Fig.6A). Consistently, PLD significantly slowed the growth of ID8 tumors compared to PBS (Fig.6B), resulting in a higher tumor suppression rate (Fig.6C), reduced tumor weight (Fig.6D) and extended survival time (Fig.6E). Both knocking down gC1qR in ID8 tumors and treatment with αC1q significantly reduced the antitumor effects of PLD (Fig.6B-E), suggesting that the regulation of PLD’s antitumor efficacy was significantly influenced by C1q in DIO mice. Moreover, knocking down gC1qR in ID8 tumors or treatment with αC1q markedly reduced PLD-induced increase in the numbers of CD11c+CD80+CD86+DCs (Fig.6F), CD8+T cells (Fig.6G), proliferating CD8+Ki67+T cells (Fig.6H), and activated CD8+CD69+T cells (Fig.6I), as well as CD8+IL-2+T (Fig.6J), CD8+IFN-γ+T (Fig.6K) and CD8+GzmB+T cells (Fig.6L), indicating that C1q participated in the antitumor immune response triggered by PLD in DIO mice. Notably, treatment with αC1q further decreased PLD-induced antitumor activity and antitumor immunity in DIO mice bearing ID8KOtumors (Fig.6B-L), indicating that PLD-triggered enhanced antitumor activity and improved antitumor immunity were regulated by C1q, which contributed to increased tumor accumulation of PLD and promoted the phagocytosis of PLD-induced apoptotic tumor cells by DCs for improved antitumor immunity.

The relationship between obesity and cancer outcomes has been a subject of intense debate, with recent clinical data suggesting a paradoxical association between obesity and improved cancer therapeutic outcomes. Ovarian cancer patients with higher BMIs have shown improved progression-free survival after chemotherapy treatments, including PLD [24]. Similar trends have been noted in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [22] and melanoma patients [10] undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy. As obesity rates continue to rise globally, it is imperative to investigate the mechanisms by which obesity influences chemotherapy and to develop targeted therapies for cancer patients.

The formation of the protein corona significantly influences the properties of nanomedicines. Strategies to design and manipulate the protein corona can be categorized into two main approaches. The first involves minimizing protein corona formation by employing the “stealth effect,” where a hydrophilic polymer such as PEG is used to coat nanomedicines, reducing non-specific interactions with blood proteins and enhancing circulation times [45,46]. The second strategy involves intentionally adsorbing specific plasma proteins to enhance the targeting efficiency of nanomedicines through surface engineering [47,48]. However, the range of adsorbed proteins is currently limited, with few studies exploring the roles of proteins beyond the apolipoprotein family and albumin in the in vivo behavior of nanomedicines. In this study, we uncovered that the chronic inflammatory environment associated with obesity led to the upregulation of C1q protein in mouse plasma, which adsorbed to PLD with high affinity. The interaction between C1q and gC1qR on tumor cells not only conferred tumor-targeting capabilities to PLD but also amplified the ICD effects, leading to significant tumor suppression in DIO mice.

The ICD phenomenon allows DCs to recognize and eliminate apoptotic tumor cells through “eat me” signals such as CRT, thereby promoting T cell-mediated antitumor immunity [49]. However, a delay in the quick removal of apoptotic cells can result in their disintegration and the release of immunogenic molecules like TNF-α into the surrounding tissue, triggering a pro-inflammatory response and potentially leading to autoimmunity [50,51]. Previous works have indicated that certain collagen family members, including the complement protein C1q, serve as co-stimulatory molecules that expedite the clearance of apoptotic cells by DCs, preventing the release of inflammatory factors [52]. Additionally, Andrea et al. demonstrated that C1q bound to apoptotic cells inhibited the proliferation of Th17 and Th1 T cell subsets mediated by macrophages and DCs, thereby remodeling the adaptive immune system [53]. This highlights the dual role of C1q in promoting the clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes and in regulating inflammatory responses within the autophagic system. In this work, we discovered that C1q adsorbed onto PLD not only intensified the ICD effects but also engaged in the phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells by DCs, which promoted antitumor immunity to exert strong anticancer efficacy in DIO mice. However, the exact mechanism by which C1q on PLD promoted DC phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells required further clarification. In addition, C1q serves a critical role in the classical complement pathway, recognizing and contributing to the lysis of tumor cells [54]. The extent to which C1q influenced complement-dependent cytotoxic effects in the anticancer activity of PLD in DIO mice warranted additional investigation.

In summary, our study reveals that PLD in obese mice adsorbs a higher quantity of C1q protein, which effectively targets tumor cells and induces greater ICD effects. The binding of C1q to apoptotic tumor cells facilitates DC phagocytosis, enhancing the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs and activating CD8+T cells. This C1q-mediated process significantly promotes the efficacy of PLD in cancer therapy in DIO mice. Collectively, this strategy highlights the importance of the personalized protein corona in regulating the therapeutic efficacy of nanomedicines, offering innovative avenues for the personalized treatment of cancer patients.

Lentiviral particles were isolated 48 h after transfection and further infected ID8 cells. ID8 cells were cultured and selected with medium containing 2µg mL−1puromycin for 7 days, and then expanded in DMEM medium containing 1µg mL−1puromycin. The efficiency of gC1qR knockdown in ID8 cells was verified via western blot. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-β-actin (Proteintech, cat. No 60008-1-1 g, clone 7D2C10, 1/2000 dilution) and anti-gC1qR (ABclonal, cat. No A11292, clone ARC2753, 1/1000 dilution).

ID8 and ID8KOcells were exposed to PLD@NP or PLD@DP under conditions where the concentration of DOX was 10µg mL−1, the pH was maintained at 7.4, and the temperature was kept at 37 °C for a duration of 4 h. The cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and then DOX fluorescence was measured by CytoFLEX S flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA).

ID8 and ID8KOcells were treated with PLD@NP or PLD@DP under conditions where the concentration of DOX was 10µg mL−1, the pH was maintained at 7.4, and the temperature was kept at 37 °C for a duration of 24 h. After removing the drug and washing with PBS, 10µL CCK-8 (Biosharp Company, Shanghai, China) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the dark. The adsorbance at 450 nm was measured on a Labsystems iEMS microplate reader (Helsinki, Finland).

ID8 and ID8KOcells were incubated with DOX, PLD@NP or PLD@DP at DOX concentration of 10µg mL−1for 12 h. The supernatants were collected for analysis of HMGB1 and ATP levels using the HMGB1 ELISA kit (Moshake Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) and enhanced ATP assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), respectively. The cells were then stained with a anti-mouse CRT antibody for 30 min and then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 60 min. The ratio of CRT-positive cells was determined using CytoFLEX S flow cytometry. The above treated ID8 cells were stained with DiO and co-cultured with immature BMDCs for 12 h. BMDCs were subsequently stained with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against CD11c, CD80 and CD86. Phagocytosis of tumor cells by BMDCs (CD11c+DiO+cells) and BMDC maturation (CD11c+CD80+CD86+cells) were assessed using CytoFLEX S flow cytometry.

For T lymphocyte activation analysis, BMDCs from the above treatment were co-cultured with murine CD3+T cells at a ratio of 1:4 for three days. Activated T cells were collected and surface-stained with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against CD3 and CD8. For intracellular cytokine analysis, the cells were treated with fixation buffer (Biolegend, San Diego, USA) and permeabilizing with permeabilization wash buffer (Biolegend, San Diego, USA), and then restained with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against IL-2, IFN-γand GzmB before flow cytometric analysis. The specific multi-color antibody combinations employed for the analysis of CRT-positive cells, BMDC maturation and T cell activation are outlined in TableS1.

ID8 tumor-bearing normal or DIO mice were intravenously injected with CellVue®Claret-labeled PLD at a dose of 80µg DOX. The biodistribution of CellVue®Claret was monitored at different time intervals using a Caliper IVIS Lumina II in vivo imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). At 24 h post-injection, tumor tissues were excised and examined to assess the distribution of CellVue®Claret within the tumor. Furthermore, mice bearing ID8 and ID8KOtumors received an intravenous injection of PLD at DOX dosage of 80µg per mouse. At 24 h post-administration, tumors and key organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys) were obtained after euthanasia of mice. The tissues were were first disrupted in 100µL of PBS, followed by the addition of 200µL of methanol. The mixture was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min to enhance the extraction of DOX. Subsequently, 100µL of the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000gfor 10 min. The fluorescence of DOX was detected using the FlexStation 3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA), with excitation set at 488 nm and emission detected at 585 nm. A calibration curve was established by spiking tissue extracts with varying DOX concentrations, enabling the calculation of DOX content in the samples based on the standard curve.

Mice bearing ID8 or ID8KOtumors received intravenous administration of PLD at 4 mg kg−1DOX dosage every three days for three times. Intratumoral injections of αC1q were given the day after PLD injections. The tumor size was detected daily by vernier forceps. On the indicated time intervals, part of the mice were sacrificed. Major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and preserved for H&E staining. Plasma was collected for serological analysis. The remaining mice were used for survival experiments and monitored for tumor size, and were executed when the tumors reached 1500 mm3.

After treatment, the tumors were collected, finely minced and then digested in RPMI 1640 medium with recombinant DNaseI (100 U mL−1) and collagenase I (0.8 mg mL−1) at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged at 300gfor 5 min, and then lysed with erythrocyte lysate (Biosharp, Hefei, China) for 5 min. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and filtered through a 40µm filter. To analyze DCs, the cells were stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies against CD11c, CD80 and CD86. To analyze T cells, the cells were stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies against CD3, CD8 and CD69. To stain intracellular cytokines, the cells were treated with Fix/Perm solution (Biolegend, San Diego, USA) and re-stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies against IL-2, IFN-γand GzmB. For Ki67 staining, the surfaced-stained cells were first treated with pre-cooled 70% ethanol for 1 h and then stained with anti-Ki67-FITC. The cells were subjected to CytoFLEX S flow cytometric analysis. Gating strategies for flow cytometric analysis of cell types involved in this study have been presented in Fig. S15. The detailed multi-color antibody panels utilized for each specific cell type are provided in Table S1.

Experiments were conducted a minimum of three times, and results were expressed as means ± SD. GraphPad Prism (version 9.0) was utilized for all statistical evaluations. Comparisons between two groups were made using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests, while comparisons between multiple groups for univariate variables were assessedviaone-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test and comparisons between multiple groups for multivariate variables were assessedviatwo-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test. Significance was set atP< 0.05 for all statistical tests.
