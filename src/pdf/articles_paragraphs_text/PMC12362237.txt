A 76-year-old man diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2017, presented in 2024 with progressing monoclonal protein (M)-spikes during second-line therapy with daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Since 2019, he had received 60 courses with a good response. Computed tomography scans demonstrated osseous lesions and a tumor in the left adrenal gland (Fig. 1AandB), showing hypermetabolic activity on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (Fig. 1C). Laboratory examination revealed increasing M-protein IgG-lambda, normal cortisol 5.6 µg/dL (SI: 153.8 nmol/L) (reference range: 5-25 µg/dL [SI:138-690 nmol/L]), and ACTH 31.3 pg/mL (SI: 6.9 pmol/L) (reference range: 10-60 pg/mL [SI: 2.2-13.2 pmol/L]) levels, negative methoxylated metabolites, and no androgen hypersecretion. Adrenal biopsy demonstrated malignant cells positive for lambda light chains (Fig. 1D), CD38 (Fig. 1E), CD138, myeloma oncogene 1, and synaptophysin. Cells were negative for pan-keratin. During daratumumab-based therapy, an extramedullary plasmacytoma developed in the adrenal gland. This is an extremely rare location mimicking adrenal carcinoma with a poor prognosis [1]. Daratumumab transfers its complex with CD38 to other cells through trogocytosis, decreasing its efficiency. Therefore, a strong expression of CD38 correlates with better treatment response [2]. This case shows that CD38 expression alone is not a definitive biomarker for efficacy. As therapy advances with longer survival, more extramedullary plasmacytomas may emerge, emphasizing the need for alternative therapies.

Note the partly whitish tumor “hot spot.” In all images, the lesion is indicated by a white arrow.

Inserts represent immunohistochemical staining, revealing lambda light chain restriction; E, immunohistochemical staining, revealing CD38 positivity.
