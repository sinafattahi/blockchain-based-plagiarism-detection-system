MFe2O4(M = Co and Mn) nanoparticles were synthesized from coconut coir extract using a microwave-assisted co-precipitation method, representing a green and sustainable approach for ferrite nanomaterial preparation. The physical properties of the samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Scanning electron micrographs revealed nanoscale morphology with evidence of polymorphism. Rietveld refinement confirmed the formation of single-phase spinel ferrites with lattice constants ranging from 8.4224 Å to 8.4782 Å for CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4, respectively. The distribution of metal cations at the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the AB2O4spinel lattice was found to depend on the synthesis route and significantly influenced the magnetic and optical behaviors of the materials. Raman spectra exhibited characteristic peaks corresponding to a mixed spinel structure. The optical band gaps estimated from the UV-vis spectra were 2.66 eV for CoFe2O4and 2.64 eV for MnFe2O4. PL spectra showed four distinct emission peaks at 458, 692, 758, and 871 nm. Based on UV-vis and photoluminescence spectral results, a schematic energy band structure was constructed. Magnetic measurements, analyzed using the “law of approach” to saturation, revealed saturation magnetizations of 70 emu g−1(CoFe2O4) and 49 emu g−1(MnFe2O4) at 55 K—values that are among the highest reported for these systems; the squareness ratios were 0.58 and 0.12, respectively. The CoFe2O4sample exhibited high effective anisotropy due to surface spin contributions, resulting in high coercivity and squareness. In contrast, the enhanced dipolar interactions in MnFe2O4reduced coercivity and squareness. These magnetic behaviors were interpreted within the frameworks of the Stoner–Wohlfarth and superparamagnetic models that account for interparticle interactions.

The diverse applications of ferrites necessitate the selection of appropriate synthesis techniques to ensure optimal performance. A variety of physical and chemical methods have been employed for the fabrication of ferrite NPs, including sol–gel,24hydrothermal,25co-precipitation,26thermal decomposition,27and high-energy ball milling.28While these approaches offer flexibility in process control and enable the rapid production of large quantities of ferrite NPs, many rely on the use of toxic solvents, reducing agents, and stabilizers. Such chemicals pose significant environmental and health hazards, especially in long-term exposure. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative, environmentally benign synthesis routes—particularly green methodologies—that minimize toxic by-products while maintaining or enhancing the desired functional properties of nanoferrites.

Among the various techniques, co-precipitation is widely favored due to its simplicity and capacity for precise control over key synthesis parameters, such as particle size, morphology, temperature, pH, precursor concentration, and alkali addition rate.29However, achieving high crystallinity in the resulting ferrite NPs typically requires a post-synthesis calcination step at elevated temperatures.30Moreover, maintaining consistent product quality and stability throughout the synthesis process can be challenging, particularly when the precipitation reaction lacks continuous control.31To address these limitations, we propose a green, microwave-assisted co-precipitation method that incorporates a biocompatible and non-toxic natural surfactant derived from coconut coir extract. This approach integrates the advantages of microwave heating with sustainable synthesis practices. Microwave irradiation significantly reduces reaction time and enhances reaction efficiency by directly coupling with materials through mechanisms, such as dielectric and magnetic interactions, in contrast to the indirect convective heating used in conventional methods.25,32As a result, this method facilitates rapid and uniform heating of reactants, promotes homogeneous nucleation, and enables the formation of well-defined, crystalline MFe2O4nanoparticles. The proposed technique thus represents a promising, eco-friendly strategy for the synthesis of high-performance ferrite nanomaterials.

MFe2O4(M = Co, Mn, Ni, Zn,etc.) NPs have been successfully synthesized using phytochemicals extracted from various plant components, including flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, fruits, and roots.33These biological sources, often derived from agricultural waste or naturally occurring plants, are typically washed with distilled water to remove surface impurities. The extracts are then obtained either directly from fresh biomass or through drying and grinding processes. Among these sources, coconut stands out as one of the most abundant and readily available plants in Southeast Asia and India, making it an ideal candidate for synthesizing green nanomaterials. In particular, coconut-coir extract has been shown to contain various phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, tannins, and flavonoids, which act as natural reducing and stabilizing agents during the formation of nanoparticles.34These compounds facilitate the formation of metal oxide nanoparticles by reducing metal ions and preventing agglomeration, thereby enabling a sustainable and non-toxic synthesis route. The reducing capability of these phytochemicals has been previously verified using FTIR spectroscopy. For example, Elangoet al.35,36reported the disappearance or shift of the –OH and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O stretching bands after the synthesis of Ni and Pd nanoparticles with coconut coir extract, suggesting that these functional groups are directly involved in the redox reaction. Although our current study did not include FTIR or LC-MS analysis, the presence of such functional groups in the extract—as confirmed in earlier studies—strongly supports its role in nanoparticle formation. The effective control over particle size and phase purity observed in our work is thus consistent with the phytochemical-mediated synthesis mechanism proposed in the literature. Despite its availability, only a limited number of studies have employed coconut-based bio-extracts in the synthesis of nanoparticle formulations. Existing reports have focused primarily on the green synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles—such as silver, lead, palladium, copper oxide, and zinc oxide—using coconut coir as a reducing and stabilizing agent.34–38To date, however, no reports have been published on the one-step green synthesis of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4NPsviamicrowave-assisted co-precipitation (MAP) using coconut coir extract. The present study addresses this gap by developing a sustainable MAP approach for the synthesis of MFe2O4(M = Co, Mn) NPs. We further investigate the influence of morphology, crystal structure, and cation distribution on the optical and magnetic properties of the resulting materials. In particular, the UV-vis absorption data were used to estimate the optical bandgap, while photoluminescence (PL) measurements supported the construction of energy band structure diagrams. These spectral results also allowed us to assess the photothermal response of the samples using theoretical parameters derived from Mie theory. Beyond the novelty of the green synthesis approach, this work reveals notable differences in the magnetic behavior between CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4NPs. While the magnetism in CoFe2O4is predominantly governed by surface spin contributions, the magnetic properties of MnFe2O4are better described by a modified superparamagnetic interaction model.

Importantly, the synthesis process described here does not require external catalysts, is performed at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, and relies entirely on non-toxic, plant-derived materials—highlighting its potential for eco-friendly and scalable production of functional ferrite nanomaterials. Unlike previous reports that use either microwave heating or plant extracts separately, this study uniquely combines both, with coconut-coir extract serving as the biogenic complexing agent—an approach not yet reported in the literature for transition-metal ferrites.

Cobalt(ii) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 98%; Avra, India), manganese(ii) chloride (MnCl2, 98%; Aldrich, USA), anhydrous iron(iii) chloride (FeCl3, 98%; Avra, India), citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O, 99.7–102%; Himedia, India), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97%; Molychem, India) were used as precursors without further purification. Coconut coir was sourced from the local market in Vellore, India. Distilled water and ethanol were used throughout the synthesis process.

MFe2O4(M = Co, Mn) nanoparticles were synthesizedviaa microwave-assisted co-precipitation method. Stoichiometric amounts of M2+and Fe3+precursors were dissolved in 35 mL of distilled water at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 under continuous magnetic stirring. The pH of the solution was adjusted to approximately 10 by the dropwise addition of 50 mL of 1 M NaOH solution to initiate the co-precipitation process. Subsequently, 20 mL of coconut coir extract was added as a biogenic stabilizing agent. The resulting mixture was transferred to a microwave reactor (SINEO UWave-1000 Microwave Ultraviolet Ultrasonic Synthesis/Extraction Reactor) and irradiated at 350 W for 30 minutes. After completion, the reaction vessel was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature under ambient conditions. During this stage, the pH gradually decreased and stabilized near neutral. The resulting black precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with distilled water and ethanol to remove unreacted residues and by-products, and then dried in a hot-air oven at 80 °C for 4 hours to obtain the final ferrite nanopowder.

The crystal structure and phase purity of the synthesized MFe2O4nanoparticles were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE Eco) with Cu Kα radiation (λ= 0.154 nm) over a 2θrange of 10° to 80°, with a scanning step size of 0.02°. Rietveld refinement was performed using FullProf software employing a Lorentz profile function to extract the lattice parameters and cation distributions across the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites. The surface morphology and particle size were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), which was also equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector to determine the elemental composition of the samples. Optical band gap values were determined from UV-vis absorption spectra recorded on a JASCO V-770 UV-vis spectrophotometer. PL measurements were carried out using a Horiba Fluorolog 3 FL3-22 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm. Raman spectra were acquired using a Horiba XploRA PLUS Micro Raman spectrometer with a 785 nm laser excitation source. Magnetic properties were assessed by measuring hysteresis loops at room temperature using a Quantum Design VersaLab Physical Property Measurement System (model VL173), under an applied magnetic field of up to 30 kOe.

In this study, samples were fabricated at Vellore Institute of Technology, India. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and PL measurements were conducted at the University of Science and Education, Danang University. The SEM and magnetic measurements were performed at the Institute of Materials Science, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, and UV-vis measurements were conducted at Hanoi National University of Education.

Fig. 1(a and b)present the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4NPs. All observed diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the standard reference patterns from the Crystallography Open Database (COD), specifically card no. 153-5820 for CoFe2O4and card no. 230-0585 for MnFe2O4. These patterns confirm the formation of single-phase spinel structures with space groupFd3̄m, characteristic of ferrite systems. Within the detection limits of the XRD measurements, no impurity phases or residual precursor signals were detected, indicating high phase purity.

It is worth noting that the reducedχ2value obtained from the Rietveld refinement is relatively low (seeTable 1), approximately 0.035. Although values in the range 1 <χ2< 2 are often considered typical, significantly lower values may occur when the dataset has very low statistical variance—particularly in cases of high-quality experimental data, low background noise, and a large number of refined points. As discussed by Brian H. Toby,42such conditions can reduce the denominator of theχ2equation (i.e., the variance of the intensity), thereby lowering the overall value without implying overfitting or an artificially perfect model. This interpretation is consistent with our results: the difference plot (Yobs.−Ycalc.) shown inFig. 1exhibits random, non-systematic deviations around zero, further confirming the validity of the model. Additionally, the refinement achievedRwpvalues below 10%, which—together with the lowχ2—provides strong evidence for the reliability and consistency of the extracted structural parameters within the spinel phase.

The experimentally determined lattice parameters (aexp) and unit cell volumes are listed inTable 1. These values are consistent with those reported in prior studies on spinel ferrite systems.4,6,43,44Notably, the lattice parameter of MnFe2O4was found to be larger than that of CoFe2O4. This difference can be attributed to the larger ionic radii of Mn2+ions compared to Co2+ions at both tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites (0.66 Åvs.0.58 Å at A sites; 0.83 Åvs.0.745 Å at B sites),45resulting in a greater lattice expansion for MnFe2O4. In addition to lattice constants, the cation distribution in the spinel lattice was estimated from Rietveld refinement using a crystallographic model constrained by theFd3̄mspace group symmetry. Although conventional XRD lacks the sensitivity to unambiguously distinguish between transition metal cations with similar atomic numbers (e.g., Co2+, Mn2+, Fe3+), the refinement provides semi-quantitative insight into site occupancies when constrained by physically meaningful structural models. The obtained inversion parameters for CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4are consistent with literature values reported for materials synthesized under comparable conditions.46The reliability of the refinement is supported by lowRwpandχ2values, as well as by well-distributed residual plots (Fig. 1), indicating good agreement between the experimental and calculated diffraction profiles.

While more element-specific techniques such as Mössbauer spectroscopy or X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are typically required for a definitive determination of site occupancies, the present refinement yields values that are in good agreement with those obtained from such methods in previous studies.47–49Accordingly, the cation distributions discussed herein should be regarded as refined estimations based on structural constraints rather than absolute determinations. The refined site occupancies and atomic coordinates are summarized inTable 1, and the corresponding crystallographic models are illustrated inFig. 1(c and d). For CoFe2O4, the tetrahedral 8a site was occupied by 34% Co2+and 66% Fe3+, while the octahedral 16d site was composed of 17% Co2+and 83% Fe3+. In the case of MnFe2O4, the 8a site was occupied by 33% Mn2+and 67% Fe3+, whereas the 16d site was composed of 32% Mn2+and 68% Fe3+. In both samples, the oxygen anions fully occupied the 32e site. The observed distribution of M2+and Fe3+ions across both tetrahedral and octahedral sites confirms the formation of mixed spinel structures in CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles. This cationic disorder is known to significantly influence the magnetic and optical properties of spinel ferrites and is consistent with the results reported in the literature.

whereβhklis the peak broadening (FWHM) after correction for instrumental broadening,θis the Bragg angle,Kis the shape factor (typically 0.9),D(in nm) is the average crystallite size,εis the lattice strain, andλ(0.154 nm) is the X-ray wavelength.

An increase in crystallite size was generally accompanied by an increase in particle size, as revealed by the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images presented inFig. 3(a and c). In these images, the MFe2O4nanoparticles were observed to form nearly spherical morphologies with relatively uniform sizes, although some extent of agglomeration was also evident. Particle size distribution histograms, constructed using ImageJ software and shown in the inset ofFig. 3(a and c), were employed to statistically determine the average particle diameters (d) of the samples.

As summarized inTable 1, the mean particle size was found to increase from 17.21 nm for CoFe2O4to 29.83 nm for MnFe2O4. This difference may be attributed to the variation in ionic radii between Mn2+and Co2+ions, which are known to affect the crystallization dynamics and grain growth rates during synthesis. The grain sizes estimated from SEM analysis were found to be in close agreement with the crystallite sizes obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Williamson–Hall method, with minimal deviation. This consistency suggests that the particles are likely to be monocrystalline or consist of highly crystalline domains. Furthermore, no sub-grain boundaries or distinct contrast variations were observed within individual particles in the SEM micrographs, which would otherwise indicate internal polycrystallinity. Although the possibility of inter-crystallite agglomeration cannot be entirely excluded, the absence of inter-particle fringes, combined with the close correspondence to the XRD-derived sizes, supports the assumption that the grains are structurally coherent and predominantly single-domain. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that more conclusive identification of crystallinity would require high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) or selected area electron diffraction (SAED), which were beyond the scope of the current study.

As shown in the insets ofFig. 3(b and d), the atomic percentages of metal cations and anions, determined from the EDX spectra averaged over three different positions for each sample, were found to be close to the ideal cation-to-anion stoichiometric ratio of 3 : 4 for spinel ferrites. This observation further confirmed that the metal precursors were effectively incorporated into the ferrite lattice, forming compositionally homogeneous MFe2O4nanoparticles without detectable residual or impurity elements.

In addition, the lattice strain (ε), determinedviaWilliamson–Hall analysis, was found to increase from 0.52 × 10−3for CoFe2O4to 2.48 × 10−3for MnFe2O4. This trend indicates that the incorporation of Mn ions not only expanded the unit cell but also introduced greater internal stress, which could further influence both the microstructural evolution and the functional properties of the materials.

Fig. 4displays the Raman spectra of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles, recorded in the spectral range of 70–1000 cm−1. Peak assignment was performed based on literature ref.55–59. The A1g mode was observed at 633 cm−1for CoFe2O4and 672 cm−1for MnFe2O4, attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of oxygen atoms in the AO4tetrahedra. The T2g(3), T2g(2), and T2g(1) modes, corresponding to various symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations of the metal–oxygen bonds, were observed at approximately 480, 304, and 125 cm−1for CoFe2O4and at 459, 308, and 125 cm−1for MnFe2O4, respectively. Most of the Raman bands appeared asymmetric, indicating overlapping vibrational contributions from multiple lattice sites. To resolve these overlapping features, spectral deconvolution was performed. The fitting parameters obtained are summarized inTable 2. The presence of multiple sub-peaks, often represented as doublets,16,57–59further supports the existence of a mixed or partially inverted spinel structure in both samples, consistent with previous reports. This splitting of Raman modes can be attributed to variations in cation occupancy between tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites, leading to local symmetry distortions and non-equivalent vibrational environments. Such structural disorder, arising from partial inversion and site-sharing between Co2+and Fe3+ions, directly influences the observed optical phonon modes and results in the complex spectral features recorded. Therefore, the Raman spectra serve as a sensitive probe of the cation distribution and local structural symmetry in the spinel lattice. These findings are consistent with the cation distribution obtained from Rietveld refinement, demonstrating the complementary nature of Raman spectroscopy and crystallographic analysis in elucidating the structural properties of ferrite nanoparticles.

whereαis the absorption coefficient,hνis the incident photon energy,Ais a proportionality constant, andnis a transition-related exponent. The value ofnindicates the nature of the electronic transition:n= 1/2 for allowed direct,n= 2 for allowed indirect,n= 3/2 for forbidden direct, andn= 3 for forbidden indirect transitions.

In the case of spinel ferrites, such as CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4, numerous theoretical and experimental studies have confirmed that they exhibit direct allowed transitions.63–65Therefore, the Tauc plots inFig. 6(a and b)were constructed usingn= 1/2, corresponding to a direct allowed transition, and the optical bandgap was extracted from the linear extrapolation of (αhν)2versus hν.

TheEgvalues were determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the plots to the photon energy axis (hν), where (αhν)2= 0. The estimated bandgap energies were 2.66 eV for CoFe2O4and 2.64 eV for MnFe2O4, in close agreement with previously reported values for similar nanocrystalline ferrites.6,64,65These results confirm that the optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles are consistent with those expected for spinel-type MFe2O4materials.

whereα0,E, andE0are the absorption coefficient, photon energy, and onset of absorption, respectively. Theα0andE0values depend on the characteristics of each material, andEu=kBT/σis referred to as the Urbach energy, whereσandkBare the steepness parameter and the Boltzmann constant, respectively.

Fig. 6(c and d)present the plots of ln(α)versusphoton energy (E) for CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4NPs, respectively. TheEuvalues, determined from the inverse slopes of the linear fits in the low-energy absorption tail, were found to be 0.83 eV for CoFe2O4and 0.78 eV for MnFe2O4. Although the MnFe2O4sample exhibited a larger grain size, itsEuvalue was slightly lower than that of CoFe2O4. This observation suggests that the disorder in these spinel ferrites is not dominated solely by grain boundary density but also significantly influenced by oxygen vacancies, surface disorder, and cationic redistribution at the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.

Fig. 7illustrates the room-temperature PL spectra of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4NPs in the 400–900 nm wavelength range. Both samples exhibited emission bands centered at approximately 458, 692, 753/758, and 871/882 nm, indicating multiple defect-related recombination pathways.

The PL spectra of both samples exhibit multiple emission bands arising from defect-related recombination pathways. The broad red emission band centered around 692 nm, observed in both CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4, along with near-infrared peaks at ∼871 nm and ∼882 nm, respectively, can be attributed to electron transitions from deep-level defect states—such as oxygen vacancies or antisite defects—to the valence band. The higher-wavelength emission in MnFe2O4is likely related to its narrower bandgap and greater degree of lattice disorder, which aligns with its larger Urbach energy. Additionally, the blue emission at ∼458 nm and the red band near 753/758 nm are assigned to transitions involving shallow trap states and surface defects, in agreement with the typical PL behavior reported for spinel ferrites. These peak assignments are consistent with previous reports on CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles,8,13,16,17,25,68,69which associate the observed PL emissions with intrinsic defects, such as oxygen vacancies, Fe2+/Fe3+transitions, and antisite disorder in the spinel lattice. While the PL intensity is generally expected to decrease with increasing defect density due to enhanced non-radiative recombination, some studies—such as that by Tongayet al.73on MoS2, MoSe2, and WSe2—have reported the opposite trend. This highlights the complex interplay between radiative and non-radiative pathways in nanomaterials and reinforces the importance of interpreting PL results in conjunction with structural and optical analyses.

Therefore, to draw meaningful interpretations regarding electronic transitions and defect states in MFe2O4(M = Co, Mn) NPs, the PL spectra must be considered in the broader context of the band structures of samples, which are derived from both UV-vis, PL and Urbach analyses.

Based on these findings and the results obtained in this work from UV-vis absorption, PL spectroscopy, and Urbach energy analyses, a comprehensive electronic band structure diagram was proposed for MFe2O4(M = Co, Mn) nanoparticles (Fig. 8). The energy gap between the O(2p) valence band and the M(4s) conduction band is typically in the range of 4–6 eV for spinel ferrites.76,81,82Within this range, the 3d orbitals of transition metal ions split into distinct energy levels under crystal field interactions: for octahedral (B) sites, the splitting between t2gand eglevels is defined byΔcf,O≈ 1.75 eV, and for tetrahedral (A) sites, the splitting between e and t2levels is characterized byΔtf,O≈ 0.8 eV.74Additional splitting (∼0.9 eV) between the O(2p) valence band and the t2g/e levels further modulates the band structure, as observed in various experimental reports.75,77The bandgap energy extracted from Tauc plots (Fig. 6(a and b)) was 2.66 eV for CoFe2O4and 2.64 eV for MnFe2O4, corresponding well to the transition from the O(2p) level to the eglevel in the B crystal field. Moreover, the onset of absorption observed in the Urbach plots (Fig. 6c and d) appears to correspond closely withΔcf,O(∼1.75 eV) or transitions from the O(2p) band to the t2level of the A field (∼1.8 eV). These values support the involvement of localized sub-bandgap states in the optical absorption process.

The presence of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortions, as previously evidenced by Williamson–Hall analysis and FTIR spectral features, suggests the existence of localised defect states within the bandgap of both CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4. These structural imperfections are expected to play a significant role in charge carrier dynamics. Under excitation at 310 nm (∼4.0 eV), electrons are promoted to high-energy states such as the egorbital at the B-site cations, followed by radiative or non-radiative relaxation. Initially, both samples exhibited a broad PL emission peak centred at 458 nm (2.70 eV), which coincides with the optical bandgap obtained from UV-vis absorption, suggesting a possible direct transition from the conduction band to the O(2p) valence band.

However, Gaussian deconvolution of the PL spectra revealed that this apparent single peak comprises two components: 443 nm (2.80 eV) and 485 nm (2.56 eV) in CoFe2O4, and 443 nm (2.80 eV) and 509 nm (2.44 eV) in MnFe2O4. The higher-energy emission at 2.80 eV may be attributed to excitonic transitions or recombinationviashallow donor states, while the lower-energy bands are ascribed to deep-level defect emissions, possibly involving oxygen vacancies or Fe3+/Co2+trap states. These observations indicate that, although near-band-edge transitions are present, defect-assisted recombination processes dominate the photoluminescence behaviour of both ferrite systems. The red emission at 692 nm (1.79 eV) can be attributed either to t2g→ egtransitions in the B site or to electron recombination from the e orbital in the A site to the O(2p) valence band. The weaker red emission at 753 nm (1.65 eV) likely originates from e → t2transitions within the A site. Lastly, the near-infrared emissions at 871 nm (1.42 eV) for CoFe2O4and 882 nm (1.40 eV) for MnFe2O4are attributed to deep trap states associated with oxygen vacancies and cation disorder in the A site lattice environment. These energy transitions are coherent with the proposed schematic (Fig. 8), demonstrating the strong correlation between electronic structure, defect states, and the optical behavior of spinel ferrite nanoparticles.

The combined structural and spectroscopic analyses of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles reveal a coherent picture of how cation distribution, crystallite size, and surface defect states modulate their optical and electronic properties. The constructed energy band schematic captures the essential transitions involving the O(2p) → 3d crystal field levels, explaining both the band-edge absorption and PL emission behaviors. Notably, blue and red emissions were matched with recombinations involving eg→ O(2p) and t2g→ egtransitions, while near-infrared emissions were attributed to electron traps associated with oxygen vacancies. Together, these findings underscore the importance of controlled cation distribution and structural order in tailoring the optical and electronic performance of spinel ferrite nanoparticles for applications in magneto-optical, photocatalytic, and biomedical technologies.

The proposed energy band diagrams for MFe2O4nanoparticles were constructed based on the experimental UV-vis absorption and PL data. The band edge positions and defect-related emission features were interpreted in conjunction with literature reports on similar spinel ferrites,69,75,77facilitating a qualitative but coherent description of electronic transitions and energy transfer mechanisms. Although direct probing of the electronic structure through techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), or density functional theory (DFT) calculations was not performed, theoretical data from previous studies were incorporated to enhance the credibility of the proposed models.

Overall, the experimentally determined band gaps were found to align well with both theoretical predictions and previously published results. The PL emission bands, which were associated with deep-level defect states, were observed to correlate with features in the calculated density of states reported in the literature. Accordingly, even in the absence of direct DFT computations, the proposed energy band diagrams are supported by a consistent and converging body of prior theoretical and experimental evidence.

Here,anandbnare Mie scattering coefficients andis the size parameter, whereDis the particle radius,nmedis the refractive index of the surrounding medium, andλ0is the vacuum wavelength of incident light.

Numerical computations of these parameters as functions of wavelength were carried out using the “MiePlot” simulation software developed by Philip Laven.90As shown inFig. 9, CoFe2O4NPs exhibited a dominant absorption contribution to extinction efficiency in the longer wavelength region (>650 nm), suggesting effective conversion of light into heat in this spectral range. In contrast, MnFe2O4NPs showed negligible absorption contribution across the entire studied wavelength range, implying low photothermal conversion efficiency.

The ratio of absorption to extinction efficiency (Qabs/Qext)—a key indicator of photothermal conversion capability—was substantially higher for CoFe2O4than for MnFe2O4. In the context of Mie theory, the absorption efficiency (Qabs) quantifies the fraction of incident light that is absorbed by the nanoparticle and subsequently converted into other forms of energy, such as heat. Meanwhile, scattering efficiency (Qsca) represents the portion of light that is elastically scattered by the particle without absorption. The total extinction efficiency (Qext) is the sum of these two contributions, reflecting the overall interaction of light with the particle. A higherQabs/Qextratio indicates that a greater fraction of the light interacting with the particle is being absorbed rather than scattered, which is a desirable feature for efficient photothermal conversion. This observation aligns with the smaller particle size and higher specific surface area of CoFe2O4, both of which are known to enhance light absorption and heat generation.69Additionally, the scattering efficiency was significantly higher for MnFe2O4, which can be attributed to its larger particle size and is consistent with classical Mie scattering predictions. While the current analysis relies on Mie theory to estimate photothermal behavior, it offers valuable insight into the interplay between nanoparticle size, composition, and optical response. We acknowledge that the absence of direct experimental photothermal measurements is a limitation of the present work. Nevertheless, theoretical modeling serves as a predictive tool for evaluating wavelength- and size-dependent photothermal efficiency. Future studies will aim to experimentally validate these findings and benchmark the photothermal performance of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles against established photothermal agents such as gold, silver, or copper sulfide nanostructures.

The fitting of magnetizationM(H) data to the Law of Approach to Saturation (LAS) model reached convergence only when the sum of squared residuals (SSR) was minimized. This condition was satisfied by selectively adjusting the parametersbandMswithin the high-field region (H> 1.0 T), where the approach to magnetic saturation becomes more pronounced.Fig. 11displays both the experimentalM(H) curves and the theoretical fits derived from the LAS model for CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4samples. The optimized values of the fitting parametersbandMsat different temperatures are summarized inTable 3.

whereMs(T) is the saturation magnetization at temperatureT,Ms(0) is the extrapolated value at 0 K, andAis the Bloch's constant. As shown inFig. 12, the experimentalMs(T) data of both samples fit well with this model. The inset ofFig. 12further confirms this by plotting [[Ms(0) −Ms(T)]/Ms(0)) as a function of temperature (T). The extracted Bloch constants wereA≈ 5.34 × 10−5K−3/2for CoFe2O4andA≈ 8.07 × 10−5K−3/2for MnFe2O4, in agreement with the values reported for other spinel ferrites,98reflecting their structural similarities. The extrapolatedMs(0) values were 72.14 emu g−1(equivalent to 3.03μB) for CoFe2O4and 50.87 emu g−1(2.10μB) for MnFe2O4. These experimental results were slightly lower than the theoretical magnetic moments estimated from cation distributions (Table 1), which yielded ∼5.64μBfor CoFe2O4(3μB× 0.34 + 5μB× 1.66 − 3μB× 0.66 − 5μB× 0.34) and ∼5.00μB(5μB× 0.33 + 5μB× 1.67 − 5μB× 0.67 − 5μB× 0.33) for MnFe2O4, where the ionic magnetic moments of Fe3+, Co2+and Mn2+were 5, 3, and 5μB, respectively. The experimentally determinedMs(0) values for both samples were lower than the theoretical predictions, likely due to a reduction in the A–B superexchange interactions as described by the three-sublattice Yafet–Kittel model,99along with the influence of the surface spin disorder inherently associated with nanoparticle systems.

To investigate the role of surface anisotropy, dipolar interactions, and nanocrystalline grain effects on the magnetic behavior of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles, the squareness ratio (R=Mr/Ms) was determined at various temperatures and is summarized inTable 3. According to the Stoner–Wohlfarth (SW) model, which assumes an ensemble of randomly oriented, non-interacting, single-domain particles, the ideal squareness ratio isR= 0.5. For uniaxially aligned particles without thermal agitation, the model predicts a higher ratio ofR= 0.832. It is important to note that both values neglect thermal fluctuation effects. As shown inTable 3, the CoFe2O4sample exhibits anRvalue of approximately 0.6 at 55 K, which decreases to 0.14 at 300 K. This trend suggests that the CoFe2O4nanoparticles possess cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy at low temperatures, consistent with previous reports on monodisperse CoFe2O4NPs,100single-domain CoFe2O4systems,101and CoFe2O4/CTAB nanocomposites.102In contrast, the MnFe2O4sample exhibits a very low squareness ratio (R< 0.1) across all temperatures studied. The low squareness ratio observed in MnFe2O4can be attributed to several factors, including its relatively larger average particle size, broader size distribution, and possible surface spin disorder. These structural characteristics are known to enhance magnetostatic (dipolar) interactions and magnetic relaxation phenomena, which collectively suppress remanent magnetization. The notably small squareness value also suggests the presence of strong interparticle magnetic interactions, thereby violating the assumptions of the Stoner–Wohlfarth model, which is valid only for non-interacting, single-domain particles with uniaxial anisotropy.103This behavior is consistent with the soft magnetic nature and possible superspin glass (SSG) tendencies observed in the MnFe2O4sample. For both samples, the observedRvalues are lower than the theoretical limit of 0.5, which is frequently observed in magnetic nanostructures and generally attributed to surface spin disorder and frustration effects. Consequently, while the SW model can still provide qualitative insights into the behavior of CoFe2O4, it appears unsuitable for describing the MnFe2O4system. The relatively high squareness ratio (up to 0.6 at 55 K) for CoFe2O4further supports the presence of significant surface anisotropy, influencing its magnetocrystalline anisotropy constantK1. This is consistent with the known high cubic anisotropy of CoFe2O4, which has a theoreticalR≈ 0.832 andK1> 0. The maximum value ofK1observed in this study was 5.37 × 106erg cm−3at 55 K—substantially higher than that reported for bulk CoFe2O4(typically in the range of 1.8–3.0 × 106erg cm−3).104Such enhanced values can be attributed to increased surface contributions, reduced grain size, and strong dipolar interactions. Conversely, lowerK1values are generally indicative of weaker intrinsic anisotropy and enhanced thermal agitation at higher temperatures.

whereHc(0) is the coercive field at absolute zero, andTBis the blocking temperature. The validity of this expression can provide further insight into the magnetic relaxation and interaction mechanisms in the samples. As shown inFig. 13, the coercivity data of CoFe2O4nanoparticles exhibit a good fit to Kneller's law in the temperature range of 55K ≤T< 300 K. This agreement suggests that the CoFe2O4NPs behave as monodisperse, non-interacting, single-domain particles with ferromagnetic ordering.106The fitting yielded values ofHc(0) = 7542 Oe andTB= 276 K, confirming the validity of the single-domain model for this system. In contrast, the coercivity of MnFe2O4nanoparticles did not conform to Kneller's law over the studied temperature range, indicating the presence of significant magnetic interactions, particle size distribution, or a multi-domain nature in the MnFe2O4system.

It is important to distinguish between superparamagnetic (SPM) and SSG behaviors, both of which can manifest in nanoparticle systems depending on size distribution and interparticle interactions. In the SPM regime, each nanoparticle behaves like a single magnetic domain whose net magnetic moment can thermally fluctuate and align with the external field above the blocking temperature (TB), leading to reversible FC and ZFC magnetization curves. In contrast, the SSG state arises from strong dipolar interactions among nanoparticles, which lead to frustrated collective spin freezing at low temperatures, analogous to atomic spin glasses. This behavior is typically characterized by a bifurcation between the FC and ZFC curves that does not converge even at high temperatures, broad peaks or the absence of peaks in the ZFC curves, and low coercivity at room temperature. In our study, the observed magnetic features of MnFe2O4—such as the slow decay of FC magnetization, suppressed ZFC peak, and high-temperature bifurcation—are consistent with the SSG-like behavior. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4exhibits typical SPM features with a clearTBand larger coercivity due to stronger magnetic anisotropy.

For the MnFe2O4nanoparticles studied here, the experimental (M/Ms)versus H/Tcurves shown inFig. 15(a)deviate from the universal behavior predicted by the classical Langevin model, indicating the presence of interparticle magnetic interactions. However, when the data are replotted as a function ofH/Ms, the curves collapse onto a single master curve that follows the modified Langevin behavior, as illustrated inFig. 15(b). This observation supports the existence of an interacting superparamagnetic regime.

To provide a quantitative measure of dipolar interactions, the experimental magnetization curves were fitted using the modified Langevin model. The fitting yielded an effective interaction temperature of approximatelyT* ≈ 120 K. From this value, the dipolar interaction energy was estimated as:εD=kBT* ≈ 1.034 × 10−2eV. Although specific reports on dipolar interaction energies in MnFe2O4are scarce, this value is comparable to those observed in magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles dispersed in polymeric matrices, such as photoreticulated PEGDA-600.110This supports the presence of moderate interparticle interactions in the studied MnFe2O4system. Consequently, the observed low coercivity and small squareness ratio can be ascribed to the combined effects of reduced magnetic anisotropy and notable dipolar interactions, both of which inhibit the alignment and stability of magnetic moments under an applied field.

In this study, we investigated the structural, optical, and magnetic properties of CoFe2O4and MnFe2O4nanoparticles synthesizedviaa green microwave-assisted co-precipitation method using coconut coir extract. Rietveld refinement of XRD data confirmed the formation of a single-phase cubic spinel structure with theFd3̄mspace group in both samples. The refinement also revealed a mixed cation distribution, with Co2+and Mn2+ions occupying both tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites, indicative of a partially inverse spinel structure. This cation inversion was further supported by the presence of characteristic Raman doublets, a signature of structural disorder and mixed occupancy in ferrite nanocrystals. UV-vis analysis revealed direct optical bandgap energies of 2.66 eV for CoFe2O4and 2.64 eV for MnFe2O4. These values, along with the photoluminescence emission features and Urbach energies, were consistent with a proposed energy band diagram that accurately reflects the electronic transitions between crystal field-split states and defect-related levels in the spinel lattice. Mie theory analysis of the UV-vis absorption spectra provided insight into photothermal conversion efficiency, highlighting a dominant role of absorption in energy dissipation for CoFe2O4, whereas MnFe2O4showed a greater contribution from scattering due to larger particle size. Magnetic measurements across varying temperatures revealed distinct behaviors between the two samples. For CoFe2O4, high coercivity and squareness ratio were attributed to strong surface spin anisotropy and magnetocrystalline effects. In contrast, MnFe2O4exhibited lower coercivity and squareness ratio, explained by weaker magnetic anisotropy and pronounced dipolar interactions. The temperature dependence of saturation magnetization followed Bloch's law, with extracted spin-wave constants aligning with previously reported values for ferrite systems. Analysis using the Stoner–Wohlfarth model, Kneller's law, and a modified Langevin function further confirmed that CoFe2O4behaves as a weakly interacting single-domain ferrimagnet, while MnFe2O4displays interacting superparamagnetic characteristics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that cation substitution, particle size, and surface-related effects play pivotal roles in governing the multifunctional properties of spinel ferrite nanoparticles, thereby establishing a robust basis for optimizing their performance in magnetic, photothermal, and optoelectronic applications.
