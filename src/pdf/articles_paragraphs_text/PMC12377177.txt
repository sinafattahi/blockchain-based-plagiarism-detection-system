When treating a penetrating vertebral artery (VA) injury, blindly removing a foreign object that has pierced the artery can lead to distal embolism due to thrombus formation at the penetration site and uncontrollable hemorrhage during foreign object removal.

A 68-year-old man was impaled in the posterior neck by a 7-cm metal rod during brush cutting. Neither neurological deficits nor active bleeding was observed. CT revealed that the metal rod had penetrated between the left C1 and C2 transverse foramina, and CT angiography showed occlusion at the V2 segment of the left VA. Retrograde distal embolization via a contralateral approach was performed, followed by proximal embolization to achieve complete occlusion before rod removal. No arterial bleeding occurred during rod removal. Postoperative MRI revealed a small infarct in the left cerebellum, but no neurological deficits were present.

In cases of penetrating VA injury with a retained foreign object, vascular evaluation and embolization should be considered before foreign object removal. Retrograde distal embolization via a contralateral approach, combined with proximal embolization, may be an effective strategy for preventing distal embolism and controlling hemorrhage.

Penetrating vertebral artery injury (PVAI) is a rare condition primarily caused by gunshot or stab wounds. It can lead to distal embolism due to thrombus formation at the penetration site and uncontrollable hemorrhage during foreign object removal, with reported mortality rates ranging from 3% to 19%.1There is no consensus on optimal management strategies for PVAI requiring surgical removal of a retained foreign object.2–9Here, we present a case of PVAI in which a metal rod penetrating the vertebral artery (VA) was safely removed by combining retrograde distal embolization via a contralateral approach with antegrade proximal embolization.

A 68-year-old man was cutting brush alongside other workers when one of them accidentally hit a metal fence with a brush cutter. The impact propelled a severed 7-cm metal rod from the fence, which pierced the man’s posterior neck. He was immediately transported to our emergency department. On arrival, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4V5M6, with no neurological deficits. Vital signs were stable, and there was no active bleeding. Noncontrast CT revealed that the metal rod had penetrated between the left C1 and C2 transverse foramina (Fig. 1A). CT angiography showed occlusion at the V2 segment of the left VA (Fig. 1B). Due to the possibility of thrombus formation around the metal rod, concerns were raised about the risk of distal embolism in the posterior circulation and uncontrollable hemorrhage during rod removal. To mitigate the risk, the decision was made to remove the metal rod after endovascular treatment.

Initial imaging findings before endovascular surgery.A:Sagittal and axial noncontrast CT scans showing a metal rod (arrowheads) penetrating between the left C1 and C2 transverse foramina.B:Three-dimensional reconstructed image from CT angiography of the head demonstrating the metal rod (arrowheads) penetrating the VA, with occlusion at the V2 segment of the left VA.

Systemic heparinization was initiated under general anesthesia, and the activated clotting time was maintained above 200 seconds. Digital subtraction angiography via the left subclavian artery demonstrated occlusion at the V2 segment of the left VA (Fig. 2A). Right VA angiography revealed no intracranial vascular occlusion. The right VA had a larger diameter than the left VA, and retrograde opacification of the left VA was observed up to the V4 segment, with a thrombus translucency noted distal to the occlusion. Both posterior inferior cerebellar artery territories were perfused via the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (Fig. 2B). First, a 6-Fr Fubuki dilator kit (Asahi Intecc) was placed in the V2 segment of the right VA. Using a Traxcess14 microguidewire (Terumo), a Guidepost distal access catheter (Tokai Medical Products) was advanced, and an SL-10 microcatheter (Stryker), shaped into a J-tip, was navigated retrogradely into the left VA (Fig. 2C). Coil embolization was performed from the distal side of the penetration site to the region of the thrombus translucency using a total of 17 coils, including Axium Prime Frame, Axium Prime 3D SS, and Axium Prime 3D ES (Medtronic); i-ED COIL Detachable Coil Complex Infini (Kaneka); and Target 360 Ultra (Stryker) (Fig. 2D). Follow-up right VA angiography confirmed the absence of intracranial vessel defects or residual thrombus translucency (Fig. 2E). Subsequently, proximal embolization was carried out. A 6-Fr Fubuki dilator kit was placed in the V2 segment of the left VA. Contrast injection showed opacification up to the vicinity of the metal rod (Fig. 2F). Using the Traxcess 14 microguidewire and the Guidepost as the distal access catheter, a straight Phenom 17 microcatheter (Medtronic) was advanced to the proximal side of the metal rod. Coil embolization was performed from the penetration site to the V2/V3 junction using a total of 11 coils, including Axium Prime Frame, i-ED COIL Detachable Coil Complex Infini, Target 360 Soft (Stryker), and GALAXY G3 and GALAXY G3 XSFT micro coils (CERENOVUS) (Fig. 2G). Left VA angiography confirmed the absence of antegrade blood flow at the embolized segment (Fig. 2H). After reversal of heparinization, the metal rod was removed using forceps (Fig. 2I). No arterial bleeding occurred during rod removal.

The postoperative course was uneventful, with no neurological deficits. CT angiography the day after surgery confirmed complete occlusion of the left VA (Fig. 3A). On postoperative day 2, MR angiography revealed occlusion of the left VA (Fig. 3B), and diffusion-weighted MRI revealed a small infarct in the left cerebellum (Fig. 3C), but no neurological deficits were present. The patient was discharged ambulatory on postoperative day 11. Since then, he has been seen on an outpatient basis for 2.5 years without experiencing any neurological complications.

The necessary informed consent was obtained in this study.

In this case, a metal rod penetrating the VA was safely removed by combining retrograde distal embolization via a contralateral approach with proximal embolization. Blindly removing the metal rod carried significant risks, including distal embolism due to thrombus formation at the penetration site—potentially resulting in posterior circulation infarction—and uncontrollable hemorrhage during rod removal. By adopting a contralateral approach, catheter manipulation around the penetration site was avoided, thereby reducing the risk of thrombus dislodgment and distal embolism. Subsequent proximal embolization enabled secure hemostasis, allowing the foreign object to be removed without hemorrhagic complications.

Ischemia resulting from PVAI is often not apparent immediately after trauma. The mean time from injury to stroke has been reported to be 4.3 days, with 78% of strokes occurring more than 48 hours after injury.10Basilar artery occlusion can be fatal.11Active bleeding and an expanding hematoma are often observed at the penetration site; however, when the vessel injury is small or punctate, as in this case, patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit only a localized hematoma.5,12Due to the anatomical course of the VA running through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae, achieving hemostasis through manual compression from the body surface is extremely difficult.13Even in cases without neurological deficits or active bleeding at the penetration site, VA injury should be considered. Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing arterial injuries, with a reported sensitivity of 98% for detecting occult VA injuries.12CT angiography is less invasive and has a high concordance rate with digital subtraction angiography findings (98%), making it a valuable screening tool.14When PVAI is suspected, proactive vascular evaluation should be performed, and embolization before foreign object removal should be considered.

Due to the anatomical course of the VA running through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae, surgical approaches are often challenging and require extensive cervical dissection; therefore, endovascular treatment is often selected.15Unilateral embolization of the VA is usually well tolerated without causing ischemia and is considered an acceptable risk, especially in emergency settings.12,16,17Tolerance is especially high when the contralateral VA is anatomically normal and equal to or larger in diameter than the artery to be embolized.18We conducted a literature review of previously reported cases of PVAI with retained penetrating objects that were managed with endovascular embolization, limiting our search to peer-reviewed articles indexed in PubMed. Only 9 such cases, including this one, were identified (Table 1).2–9Of the 9 cases, 2 patients underwent proximal embolization alone and 7 underwent both proximal and distal embolization. Of the 7 patients who underwent both proximal and distal embolization, specific descriptions of the approach route were lacking for 2, an ipsilateral approach was used in 2, a contralateral approach was used in 3 patients. Of the 9 patients, 5 underwent manual removal after embolization and 4 underwent surgical removal. No procedure-related complications were reported, and overall outcomes were favorable.

There is no consensus on whether embolization should be limited to the proximal side of the penetration site or extended to both the proximal and distal sides. Because proximal embolization alone might allow retrograde blood flow, which can lead to distal hemorrhage, adding distal embolization is usually recommended.6,19Similarly, there is no standardized approach route for distal embolization. In this case, the proximal side of the penetration site had been already occluded. The initial treatment strategy for this case included distal embolization to prevent hemorrhage due to retrograde blood flow. A notable feature of this case, however, was the presence of a well-demarcated thrombus distal to the penetration site, which raised concern that advancing a catheter with an ipsilateral approach in the left VA could lead to thrombus dislodgment and distal embolism. Therefore, we decided to approach from the right VA and perform distal embolization of the left VA first. Coil embolization was performed thoroughly up to the area where a thrombus translucency was observed. Subsequent proximal embolization allowed for safe rod removal without hemorrhagic complications. This approach may be technically challenging depending on the angulation of the vertebrobasilar junction, but it offers advantages in preventing distal embolism and controlling hemorrhage during foreign object removal. It should be proactively considered as a viable treatment strategy, especially when a thrombus is clearly visible distal to the penetration site and the risk of distal embolism is high, as in this case.

In this case, a PVAI was safely managed by combining retrograde distal embolization via a contralateral approach with proximal embolization. Because a thrombus was identified distal to the penetration site, an ipsilateral approach carried a high risk of thrombus dislodgment and distal embolism. The contralateral approach allowed safe navigation and effective embolization while avoiding catheter manipulation around the thrombus. This strategy successfully prevented both distal embolism and hemorrhage, resulting in a favorable clinical outcome. Given the limited number of similar reports, this case provides valuable evidence supporting the utility of a contralateral approach in selected PVAI cases.

When treating a PVAI, blindly removing a penetrating object can result in distal embolism and uncontrollable hemorrhage. Therefore, vascular evaluation and embolization should be considered before foreign object removal. Retrograde distal embolization via a contralateral approach, combined with proximal embolization, may be an effective strategy for preventing distal embolism and controlling hemorrhage.
