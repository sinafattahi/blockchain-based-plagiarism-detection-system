H3K27-altered diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a fatal disease, including four subtypes H3.3-mutant, H3.1/H3.2-mutant, H3-wildtype with EZHIP overexpression, andEGFR-mutant.H3F3B, another gene encoding histone H3.3 in addition toH3F3A, was ever reported to be mutated in DMGs. However, the clinical and molecular characteristics ofH3F3B-mutant DMGs is yet understood. The clinical and radiological information of 9 patients withH3F3B-mutant DMG were retrospectively collected. Tumor specimens underwent DNA methylation profiling and next-generation sequencing. All tumors harbored somaticH3F3Bp.K27I mutation. Average patient age was 46 ± 6.86 years, 6 tumors located in spinal cord, 5 tumors involved brainstem and 2 arose in the thalamus. Immunohistochemistry showed these tumors exhibited completely or mosaic-like loss of H3K27me3 expression. Unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis of DNA methylation profiles showed thatH3F3B-mutant DMGs formed a unique methylation cluster separate from other gliomas with H3K27me3 loss and DMGs with canonical histone H3 mutation.PPM1DandNF1were frequently mutated inH3F3B-mutant DMGs. Survival analysis showed thatH3F3B-mutant DMGs had poor prognosis comparable to H3K27M-mutant DMGs. Taken together,H3F3Bmutation also cause a loss of H3K27 trimethylation in DMGs and result in poor prognosis. The distinct characteristics of DNA methylation and mutational spectrum betweenH3F3B-mutant DMGs and canonical H3K27M-mutant DMGs might suggest divergent underlying mechanism of gliomagenesis.

Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) harboring canonical H3K27M mutations (H3.3 or H3.1) is a lethal malignancy with a median survival of 9–19 months [1]. In the 2021 WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, the nomenclature has been revised to “Diffuse midline glioma, H3K27-altered” to encompass additional pathogenic mechanisms, including EZHIP overexpression andEGFRalterations [2–4]. Consequently, this entity comprises four subtypes: H3.3-mutant, H3.1/H3.2-mutant, H3-wildtype with EZHIP overexpression, andEGFR-altered. Among the two genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3AandH3F3B),H3F3Ap.K27M represents the most frequent mutation in H3.3-mutant DMG. In contrast,H3F3Bmutations are extremely rare in gliomas, with fewer than five reported cases ofH3F3B-mutant DMG in the literature to date. Owing to the scarcity ofH3F3Bp.K27I mutations, the clinicopathological and genomic characteristics ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG remain poorly characterized [5–7]. Therefore, we performed an integrated radiological, clinico-pathological and molecular (including DNA methylation profiling) characterization on a cohort of 13 patients withH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG aiming to provide further insight into the developmental nature of this tumor subset.

Tumor specimens and corresponding clinical data from the 9 patients were obtained from the consultation archives (2019–2025) of the Department of Pathology, Xuanwu Hospital, Sanbo Brain Hospital, Capital Medical University and The Southwest Hospital of Army Medical University. Initially, the decision to performH3F3Bmutation testing for all the 9 cases was prompted by immunohistochemical (IHC) findings demonstrating loss of H3K27me3 expression, negative H3K27M staining, and EZHIP overexpression. Subsequent next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed and confirmedH3F3Bp.K27I mutation in all cases. Two neuropathologists independently reviewed all tumors according to the WHO 2021 Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System [2]. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University and was conducted in full compliance with all principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Additionally, clinical information and DNA mutation data of 4 patients withH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG from previous literatures were incorporated into our study [5–7].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 4-micron-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) sections. The utilized primary antibodies were as follows: H3K27M (ABE419; Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:1000 dilution), H3K27me3 (clone C36B11, Cell Signaling, 1:50 dilution), Olig-2 (AB9610, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; 1:250 dilution), GFAP (polyclonal, Dako, USA; 1:1000 dilution), Syn (ZA-0506; Zhongshan Biotechnology Company, China), ATRX (HPA001906, Sigma, polyclonal, 1:100 dilution), EZHIP (HPA004003, Sigma, polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution), p53 (clone DO-7, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; 1:100 dilution), Ki-67 (MIB-1, Labvision, USA; 1:50 dilution). All staining was performed using Leica Bond automated staining processors.

DNA sequencing libraries were generated using GENESEEQ PRIME Solid Tumor Panel according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Sequencing data were processed through a custom bioinformatics pipeline that was developed to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions-deletions (< 50 base pairs).

DNA was extracted using the QIAamp®DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for FFPE samples and was restored using the Infnium HD FFPE Restore Kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Bisulfte conversion was performed using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California, USA). Standard quality controls confirmed DNA quality/quantity and bisulfte conversion. DNA methylation data was obtained using Illumina Epi_v2 Beadchip array (935 K) (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) and Methylation microarray scanner (Illumina NextSeq 550). t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) clustering was done withRtsnepackage (version:0.16).

The mean age at diagnosis was 46 ± 6.86 years, significantly older than the average age of patients with H3K27M-mutant DMG [8,9]. The cohort comprised 9 males and 4 females. In terms of anatomical distribution, 6 tumors located in spinal cord, 5 tumors involved the brainstem (pons: 3, medulla: 2) and 2 occupied the thalamus. Detailed clinical characteristics are summarized in Table1, with representative MRI findings presented in Fig.1.

Histological assessment ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs demonstrated heterogeneous morphology. 3 tumors met criteria for diffuse astrocytoma with moderate cellular density, and absence of mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation, or necrosis. 3 tumors exhibited anaplastic features with elevated cellular density and increased mitotic activity. The other 3 cases showed glioblastoma features with multinucleated tumor cells, microvascular hyperplasia and necrosis. IHC showed that all tumors were immuno-negative for H3K27M. 3 tumors showed mosaic-like loss of H3K27me3 expression (Fig.2), and the other 6 tumors exhibited loss of expression in the nuclei of tumor cells for H3K27me3. 9 tumors (100%) were diffusely or partially positive for GFAP and Olig-2. 2 (22.2%, 2/9) showed diffusely positive for p53 staining. None of EZHIP (CXorf67) expression or ATRX loss of expression were observed in all 9 tumors (100%, 9/9).

Given the distinct H3K27me3 loss pattern betweenH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant and canonical H3K27-altered DMG, we performed DNA methylation sequencing to characterize epigenetic divergence. Among eight tumors with available methylation data, t-SNE clustering analysis revealed thatH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs formed a unique cluster separate from gliomas with H3K27me3 loss and DMGs with canonical histone H3 mutation (Fig.3A-B and supplementary Fig.1A). Notably, since tumor location (predominantly spinal cord in our cohort) significantly influences methylation patterns, we included 11 spinal cord H3K27M-mutant DMGs as anatomical controls. Reassuringly,H3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs maintained a distinct methylation signature compared to location-matched controls, confirming their unique epigenetic landscape (Fig.3C and supplementary Fig.2).

Distinct methylation patterns may suggest unique mutational profiles in these tumors. Hence, we performed next-generation sequencing to delineate the mutational profiles ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs. Consistent with their epigenetic divergence,H3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs exhibited distinctive genomic alterations. Our data showed, besidesH3F3Bp.K27I mutation,PPM1Dwas the most frequently mutated gene (5 cases), andTP53mutation was observed in three cases.NF1mutation was observed in three cases. NoATRXmutation andMGMTpromoter methylation was found in all cases. Taken together, a total of 6 tumors harboredPPM1DandNF1mutation, 4 tumors hadTP53mutation. As compared to the genetic alterations of H3K27M-mutant DMGs [10], significant difference was observed in the prevalence ofPPM1Dmutation (p= 0.004) andNF1mutation (p< 0.001), while the prevalence ofTP53mutation andATRXmutation did not show significant difference (p= 0.169,p= 0.226, respectively). Figure4showed mutational spectrum ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG.

With follow-up data available for 11 patients, 4 patients deceased at the last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients withH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG shared similar dismal survival outcome as patients with intramedullary or brainstem H3K27M-mutant DMG (Fig.5).

Diffuse midline glioma with H3K27-altered mutation is a rare disease with dismal prognosis. While canonical DMG is characterized by histone H3.3 mutations, predominantlyH3F3Ap.K27M, mutations inH3F3B(which also encodes H3.3) remain extremely rare [5–7]. To date, the clinicopathological spectrum ofH3F3B-mutant DMG has been poorly defined. Here, we present the largest cohort ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs, revealing distinct biological features with critical clinical implications.

In our series, all tumors harbored theH3F3Bp.K27I mutation and arose in CNS midline structures, with spinal cord involvement observed in over half of cases. To our knowledge, 4H3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs were previously reported and 2 tumors were located in brainstem, 1 in thalamus and 1 in spinal cord [5–7]. Interestingly, the average age at diagnosis in our cohort is older than that of patients with H3K27M-mutant DMGs [9,11–15]. Importantly, in our cases, as compared to H3K27M-mutant DMG,PPM1DandNF1were the most frequently mutated genes, followed byTP53mutation, while noATRXmutation was found. Our earlier work identifiedTP53as the most frequently mutated gene in H3K27M-mutant primary spinal cord astrocytoma, followed byNF1,ATRXandPPM1Dmutation [16]. Similarly, the study by Chai RC et al. [17] revealed that the most frequently mutated genes includedTP53,NF1,PDGFRA,KIT,ATRXandRB1 inH3K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma. For non-spinal cord H3K27M-mutant DMG, the study by Williams EA [8] demonstrated that the most frequent genomic alterations were inTP53(64.3%),ATRX(43.8%),NF1(24.6%),PIK3CA(17.7%),PIK3R1(7.1%),FGFR1(6.4%) andPDGFRA(5.6%). Moreover, besides unique mutational profiles ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs, DNA methylation analysis showedH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs formed a cluster separate from all other entities with H3K27me3 loss including H3K27M mutant DMGs,EGFR-altered DMGs and posterior fossa group A (PFA) ependymoma. Of note, despite divergent molecular profiles, survival analysis indicated comparable poor outcomes betweenH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant and H3K27M-mutant DMG patients. The divergent mutational spectrum and epigenetic features but similar survival outcome betweenH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG and H3K27M-mutant DMG might suggest conserved and unique molecular drivers underlying the tumorigenesis ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs. Further larger-scale study is warranted to investigate underlying molecular mechanism.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that comprehensively delineate clinico-radiological and molecular landscape ofH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG. Our study provided insight intoH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMGs. These findings have significant implications for clinical practice. In cases where immunohistochemistry demonstrates complete or mosaic-like H3K27me3 loss without H3K27M mutation or EZHIP overexpression, subsequent next-generation sequencing in our cohort revealed rareH3F3Bp.K27I mutations. Thus, gliomas exhibiting H3K27me3 loss with negative H3K27M or EZHIP immunohistochemical results warrant further next-generation sequencing for definitive molecular characterization.

H3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG is a rare entity and have poor overall survival comparable to H3K27M-mutant DMG. Distinct mutational spectrum and epigenetic features betweenH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG and canonical H3K27M-mutant DMG suggest thatH3F3Bp.K27I-mutant DMG is a distinct subtype of H3K27-altered diffuse midline glioma, and larger-scale study is warranted to investigate the unique mechanism of gliomagenesis.
