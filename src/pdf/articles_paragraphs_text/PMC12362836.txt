Nurse shortage have become an international healthcare crisis. The migration of nursing professionals from developing countries enlarges nurse shortages, which harms the standard of healthcare in their home nations. This study aimed to investigate the tendency to migrate and the influencing factors among nurses in Shiraz, Iran.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 on nurses working in public hospitals in Shiraz. A total of 595 nurses were selected through stratified random sampling. The data were collected using a researcher-designed questionnaire. The data were analyzed using t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis and ordinal logistic regression through STATA v.17.

The results revealed that 63.96% of nurses expressed a high tendency to migrate. According to the estimates of ordinal logistic model, nurses’ migration tendency had a positive and significant relationship with the level of nurses’ education, hospital specialization (OR = 2.22 and 2.11 for Burn and Orthopaedics hospitals, respectively), having a plan to change job (OR = 2.68), and spouse’s income (OR = 2.23). On the other hand, being married (OR = 0.42), satisfaction with the nursing profession (OR = 0.51), and the adequacy of nurses in the ward (0.65) showed a negative relationship with the tendency to migrate among nurses.

The high level of tendency to migrate among nurses in Iran highlights a serious challenge for the Iran’s healthcare system. This study demonstrated that multiple factors play a role in nurse tendency for migration. The retention of nursing staff and migration prevention require evidence-based policies and interventions to enhance their workplace conditions, adequate staffing, job satisfaction, and professional development opportunities.

The migration of skilled professionals from underdeveloped regions has become a major movement pattern within global migration and worldwide development. The speed of this phenomenon exceeds by 2 to 15 times the normal rate of worldwide migration [1]. Medical professionals migrating to developed countries has risen as a substantial issue in the past decades, encouraging global healthcare organizations to focus on resolving this problem. The management of this process operates systematically under the supervision of international markets [2,3]. The migration of medical staff produces severe negative impacts for origin countries by depleting national skills pools and reducing state earnings, and diminishing helpful social knowledge exchange benefits, together with deteriorating medical infrastructure. Developed nations lose their development funding in education and healthcare when specialized workers move out of the country. The migration leads recipient countries to receive skilled workers’ expertise without needing to pay their education expenses. The movement of these professionals results in lower governmental earnings because skilled workers create more financial revenue than unskilled labor, leading to diminished public healthcare spending [4–8].

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in health and well-being requires 12.9 million healthcare professionals by 2035, among whom nurses will represent the majority [9–11]. WHO research indicates that migration of nurses and physicians to high-income countries grew by 60% during the last decade. Statistics show that while 20.7 million nurses and midwives are active worldwide, there is still a shortage that requires hiring more than 9 million nurses and midwives, most acutely in Africa and Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean regions [12–14].

Persian Gulf nations, experiences expanding nurse demands in its healthcare sector due to cultural traditions. Women in these regions stay away from nursing because the Islamic traditions strictly govern nursing practices. The large wage differences between developed and developing nations, as well as superior working conditions and higher quality of living, create a powerful attraction for nurses to migrate from developing countries [15]. The ongoing nurse shortages in countries like the United Kingdom and the Arab nations of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia force them to depend on migrant healthcare professionals for the sustenance of their healthcare systems. Healthcare organizations in the United States have recruited foreign nurses through programs extending back more than fifty years to fill medical staff vacancies in nursing. The UK faces reduced government funding, which restricts nursing student admissions, leading to diminished nursing candidate numbers for the job market. The U.S. nursing faculty and clinical site shortage led to rejection of over 80,000 eligible applicants in 2019 [14].

In Iran, the shortage of nurses is considered one of the main challenges in the healthcare sector. Among the primary factors influencing this crisis are unfavorable social conditions, early retirements, migration, job abandonment, employment in other professions, occupational hazards, and low recruitment rates despite the increasing number of hospital beds [10,16]. According to a 2018 report by the Iran Nursing Council, approximately 1,000 nurses migrate from Iran annually [17]. Moreover, in 2014, Iran faced a shortage of nearly 130,000 nurses [10]. Currently, the number of nurses per hospital bed across various provinces in Iran ranges from 0.6 to 1.5. Additionally, the nurse-to-population ratio is estimated at 1.5 per 1,000 people, which is lower than countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar [16–18]. Given these statistics and the growing trend of Iranian nurses migrating to developed countries and Gulf states, examining the factors associated with their migration tendency holds critical importance. Nursing administrators and policymakers need this kind of evidence in order to develop useful approaches that reduce the existing trend. Although previous quantitative studies in Iran have addressed aspects of nurse migration, many have been limited in scope and relied on smaller or single-hospital samples. Moreover, A number of studies have focused on nursing students not sursing staffs. Also, most studies were from many years ago. However, due to events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing severity of economic sanctions against Iran, the situation of the health sector’s human resources, including nurses, has changed. Therefore, a new comprehensive, multi-center study on nurses was needed. Thus, the present study stands out by employing a large and diverse sample of 595 nurses from 14 hospitals across multiple clinical specialties, capturing a wide range of workplace contexts. This design offers broader generalizability and provides evidence-based guidance for policymaking and workforce retention strategies in Iran’s healthcare system. Accordingly, it study aims to fill a critical gap in the existing literature for nursing administrators and health policymakers to design targeted interventions that address the root causes of nurse migration and strengthen workforce retention strategies in Iran’s healthcare system.

This descriptive-analytical study was carried out through a cross-sectional study design among Shiraz public hospital nurses in 2023. In this study, the sample consisted of 595 nurses. Data collection was carried out across 14 public hospitals. Based on administrative data, approximately 3400 nurses worked in these public hospitals. The minimum sample size determined by the Cochran formula was 345 (assuming the confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%); however, to increase statistical power and analysis of subgroups, the sample was extended to include 595 nurses. A proportional stratified sampling method was used. First, the total number of nurses in each hospital was obtained from administrative records. Then, the proportion of nurses in each hospital relative to the total nursing population was calculated. According to these proportions, specific quotas were determined for each hospital. Subsequently, during various work shifts, the research team visited the selected hospitals, and questionnaires were randomly distributed among the nurses for completion.

The questionnaire was developed based on relevant literature and reviewed by five independent academic nursing experts from three universities. These experts confirmed content and face validity. These experts had specialized knowledge in nurse migration and workforce studies and were not affiliated with the research team. Their structured evaluations focused on the clarity, relevance, and alignment of each item with study objectives. Revisions were made accordingly. The revised version was pilot-tested with 30 nurses from a public hospital. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, yielding a value of 0.79. Reliability was calculated across a subset of conceptually related closed-ended items reflecting nurses’ professional attitudes, workplace perceptions, and migration tendency. Demographic and open-ended questions were excluded from the reliability analysis.

The outcome variable “tendency to migrate” was captured using a single-item question with five response categories (very low, low, medium, high, very high). For analysis, tendency to migrate was categorized into a three-category variable (low, medium, high), which were treated as ordinal outcomes in all statistical models. Construct validity testing was not conducted for the migration tendency item, as it was a single-item direct question. However, the content and face validity of the full questionnaire were ensured through expert panel review and pilot testing. Moreover, the questionnaire was not intended as a psychometric scale, and thus did not require formal construct validation procedures.

Individual and demographic factors, including gender, age, marital status, education level, work experience, and number of children.

Income and financial factors such as wages and earnings from nursing and non-nursing positions, the household economic situation, spouses’ income.

Environmental and occupational factors such as workplace conditions, job satisfaction levels, staffing level and so on.

The developed questionnaire for current study is presented as a supplementary file.

Normality of the migration tendency variable was assessed using skewness and kurtosis values. The distribution was approximately symmetric, and given the large sample size (n= 595) and balanced group distributions, parametric tests such as the t-test and ANOVA were considered appropriate for bivariate analysis. Although the migration tendency variable was ordinal with three levels, it was treated as a numeric variable for the t-test and ANOVA. The outcome variable “migration tendency” was treated as a single-item with three ordinal response options (Low, Medium, High), which were coded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These codes were used to calculate mean scores and perform ordinal regression analysis. This approach is acceptable in large samples with balanced groups.

In preparation for statistical analysis, several open-ended items from the questionnaire were recoded into categorical variables. For instance, responses to the question “Which hospital ward do you work in?” were classified into standardized clinical wards such as gynecology, burn, orthopaedics, and psychiatry. Similarly, numerical entries in income-related questions (e.g., monthly income from other sources or spouse’s income) were used to generate binary variables such as “Having a second job income” or “Spouse has income.” Blank or dash responses were interpreted as the absence of income. These transformations were performed to ensure consistency and usability of the data for descriptive statistics and regression models.

Correlations between the ordinal migration tendency variable and continuous predictors (such as age, number of children, economic perception, and working hours) were examined using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, given the ordinal nature of the outcome and the non-parametric distribution of responses. Univariate analyses (Independent-Samples t-test, ANOVA, correlation) were used to explore crude associations without adjustment. Variables withp< 0.05 in univariate tests were entered into regression to estimate adjusted associations. For multivariable analysis, an ordinal logistic regression model was applied, and assumptions, including the proportional odds condition, were met. All data analyses were performed using STATA version 17 statistical software.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Code: IR.SUMS.NUMIMG.REC.1402.136) and conducted in accordance with the International Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were informed about the purpose of completing the questionnaires, and assurances were provided regarding the confidentiality of the data and the anonymity of the participants. Additionally, they were allowed to withdraw from the interview at any time, despite their initial agreement to participate.

The study revealed that, in terms of tendency for migration, 20.34% of nurses had low tendency, 16.13% had moderate tendency, and 63.53% had high tendency to migrate. The nurses participating in this study had a mean age of 32.54 ± 6.81 years and a mean work experience of 8.04 ± 6.42 years. Of the nurses, 82.52% were female, while the remaining were male. Additionally, 56.64% of the nurses were married, and 21.51% had at least one child under five years old. In terms of educational attainment, 4.37% of the nurses had qualifications below an associate degree, 89.58% held a bachelor’s degree, and 6.05% had a master’s or doctoral degree. Regarding employment status, 49.58% of the nurses were officially employed, 42.35% were contractual employees, and 8.07% worked under corporate employment. Furthermore, 88.91% of the nurses were employed exclusively in public hospitals, while 11.09% also worked in private healthcare sectors. The majority of nurses (43.03%) were employed in general specialized hospitals, predominantly in general, internal, and surgical wards (38.82%), followed by intensive care and cardiac units (30.25%).

The findings showed that the nurses had an average monthly working time of 218.63 ± 64.66 h, and 76.64% of them reported dissatisfaction with the sufficient number of nurses in their wards. Additionally, 67.73% of the nurses were dissatisfied with their nursing jobs, and 43.03% had plans to change their profession. Meanwhile, 84.20% of the nurses did not have a secondary job outside of nursing, 80.34% reported no income from other jobs, and 49.75% of their spouses were also without income. At the time of the study, the nurses earned $153 ± 33 each month on average, and their financial situation satisfaction rating, on a scale from 1 to 10, was 3.41 ± 1.83. The demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table1.

The results of the Independent-Samples t-test and ANOVA are presented in Table2. As shown in this table, the average migration tendency among single nurses (2.56 ± 0.74) was significantly higher compared to married nurses (2.34 ± 0.84) (p< 0.001). Nurses who were dissatisfied with the sufficient number of nurses in their wards (2.53 ± 0.86), those dissatisfied with their nursing job (2.56 ± 0.74), and those who had plans to change jobs (2.7 ± 0.63) also showed a significantly higher migration tendency (p< 0.01). Furthermore, nurses whose spouses had no income (2.5 ± 0.78) demonstrated a significantly higher migration tendency at a significance level of (p< 0.05). According to the findings of this study, no significant differences were observed between gender, having children under five years old, type of hospital, having another job, and receiving income from another job with respect to migration tendency among the studied nurses.

The ANOVA results based on an equality of variances test demonstrated that both nurses’ educational level (p< 0.01) and their hospital type (p< 0.05) were significantly associated with their migration Tendency. The migration tendency of nurses holding bachelor-level education at 2.45 ± 0.79 and postgraduate nurses with master’s or Ph.D. degrees at 2.57 ± 0.77 exceeded those of nurses with no academic education who scored at 1.92 ± 0.93. This difference was confirmed with statistical significance at (p< 0.01). Regarding the type of hospital, nurses working in orthopedics (2.62 ± 0.72), burn units (2.55 ± 0.72), ears, nose, and throat units (2.55 ± 0.73), as well as general specialized and subspecialized hospitals (2.46 ± 0.81) showed significantly higher migration tendencies compared to nurses in other hospitals included in the study (p< 0.05).

Post-hoc comparisons using Tukey’s HSD test indicated that the migration tendency was significantly higher among nurses with bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees compared to those with no academic degree (p< 0.05). Similarly, nurses working in orthopaedics, burn units, and ENT wards had significantly greater migration tendency compared to those in gynecology wards (p< 0.05).

Our study results, as outlined in Table3, indicate a negative and significant correlation between age and migration tendency among nurses. This negative correlation is also evident for the number of children, nurses’ perception of their economic situation, and average monthly working hours (p< 0.05). The findings suggest that as nurses’ age increases and the number of their children grows, their migration tendency decrease. Additionally, nurses’ perception of their economic situation and the average monthly working hours are negatively correlated with migration tendency. However, no significant relationship was found between the number of children under five years old and the average monthly income.

According to the results of the ordinal logistic regression presented in Table4, variables such as marital status, satisfaction with the sufficient number of nurses in the ward, and satisfaction with the nursing job had a negative effect on migration tendency and were significant predictors of migration tendency among nurses (p< 0.05). In other words, married nurses were less likely to have a migration tendency compared to single nurses. Additionally, sufficient number of nurses in the ward and job satisfaction was associated with decrease in migration tendency (0.1). Nurses with plans to change job were 2.68 times more likely to have migration tendency compared to those without plans to change their job (p< 0.01). Furthermore, nurses whose spouses had income were 2.23 times more likely to express migration tendency compared to those whose spouses had no income (p< 0.05). In terms of education level, nurses with bachelor-level education demonstrated 2.52, and nurses with master’s or Ph.D. showed 4.8 times more migration tendency than nurses without academic education. Regarding the type of hospital, nurses working in burn units and orthopedics were 2.22 and 2.11 times more likely, respectively, to have migration tendency compared to those working in gynecology hospitals (p< 0.05).

Based on the results of the ordinal logistic regression, several factors remained significantly associated with nurses’ migration tendency after adjusting for others. This regression analysis was performed to identify adjusted associations. The same 3-level ordinal variable was used throughout the analysis. The model was statistically significant (Likelihood ratio χ² = 48.72,p< 0.001), and the proportional odds assumption was reviewed and not violated.

Here, we should point out that some variables that were significant in univariate analyses (e.g., “sufficient number of nurses”) lost their statistical significance in the multivariable regression. Also, monthly working hours and perceived economic situation showed significant correlations with migration tendency in univariate analysis, but they were not significant in the regression model. On the other hand, while no significant differences were observed between hospital departments in the initial ANOVA test, further analysis showed that certain departments (such as burn and orthopaedics) were associated with higher migration tendency when considered alongside other factors. Furthermore, the unadjusted analysis suggested a higher migration tendency among nurses whose spouses had no income (mean score = 2.50 ± 0.78); the adjusted ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant association in the opposite direction (OR = 2.23,p= 0.043). This is consistent with standard findings in multivariable analysis and highlights the effect of adjusted variables and underscores the importance of multivariable analysis to estimate independent relationships.

The complex nature of nurse migration produces substantial consequences on healthcare delivery both in source nations and destination countries [3]. A worldwide nurse shortage represents a critical problem because of population aging, increasing chronic diseases, and unacceptable professional circumstances [9–11]. This study aimed to assess the migration tendency among Iranian nurses and identify the factors influencing it, thereby providing the necessary evidence to inform policymaking and optimize nursing workforce management in Iran.

The present study revealed that 63.96% of Iranian nurses expressed high migration tendency, sounding an alarm for the Iran’s healthcare system. Salehi et al. (2023) similarly reported that nurses employed in hospitals across Tehran exhibited high migration intention [17]. Correspondingly, Hasankhani et al. (2025) found that 61% of nursing students in Iran had migration tendency [19]. Another study conducted in Iran by Asadi et al. (2017) showed that 77.54% of healthcare workers expressed migration tendency [20]. The findings from international studies, particularly in developing countries, confirm these results. Worku et al. (2019) reported that 67.8% of healthcare workers in Ethiopia intended to migrate [21]. Similarly, Kadel and Bhandari (2019) revealed that over half (55.6%) of nurses in Nepal considered migrating abroad [22]. Contrastingly, migration tendency among nurses in South Korea decreased from 69.8% in 2013 to approximately 50.74% in 2016 [23,24]. In Canada, only 15% of nurses expressed tendency to migrate abroad [25]. Differences between nurses in developed and less developed countries, including managerial systems and working environment standards, as well as wage structures and professional independence, play a role in shaping migration tendency [26,27]. The high migration tendency of nurses working in developing countries probably result from economic hardships along with insufficient earnings, unsuitable workplace conditions, and limited professional prospects [15,22]. In addition, considering the time of our study, one of the reasons for the high tendency of nurses to migrate in the present study may be that the workload and job stress of nurses increased during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Murataj et al. (2022) reported that changes in working conditions, including heightened workloads after the pandemic, increased nurses’ migration likelihood by 23.68% [28].

The findings of the present study indicate that single nurses have higher migration tendency. Furthermore, a negative and significant correlation was observed between age and migration tendency, suggesting that younger nurses are more likely to express migration tendency. This result aligns with studies conducted by Konlan et al. (2023) [29], Maleki et al. (2023) [9], Asadi et al. (2017) [20], Asegid et al. (2014) [30], and Jadoo et al. (2015) [31]. Similarly, Worku et al. (2019) found that healthcare workers aged 20–29 years were 3.96 times more likely to leave their current organizations compared to those over the age of 40 [21]. It is evident that nurses who are married intend to opt for maintaining their residence in their country of origin, primarily due to the constraints imposed by familial and social obligations, which serve to diminish their tendency to migrate. Single individuals have been found to encounter more favorable career and living prospects in foreign countries, presumably due to the reduced personal responsibilities associated with being unpartnered [32]. It is evident that younger nursing staff are frequently assigned repetitive duties and encounter restrictions in terms of their participation within the workplace. Furthermore, their remuneration is often lower compared to that of their counterparts in other nursing roles. The combination of these elements has been shown to result in increased dissatisfaction among nurses in the younger age group [33].

The results of our study revealed that nurses expressed the sufficient number of nurses in their wards were less tendency to migrate. The results from this research match those reported in Yürümezoğlu & Çamveren et al. (2025) [34], Konlan et al. (2023) [29], and Salehi et al. (2023) [17]. The shortage of nurses in Iran remains the most significant challenge in the nursing sector [10]. Staffing inadequacy combined with heavy workloads creates occupational burnout among staff while reducing the standard of patient care delivery. These unfavorable working conditions drive nurses to seek better job opportunities abroad [35]. Moreover, findings from various studies, including Ibrahim et al. (2024) [36], Yuksekdag (2018) [37], Poku et al. (2023) [38], Kadel and Bhandari (2019) [22], and Rolle et al. (2020) [35], demonstrated that nurse migration exacerbates the workload among remaining nurses and diminishes both nurse and patient satisfaction. When nurses relocate overseas for better opportunities, the source country experiences a higher nurse-to-patient ratio, which leads to higher workloads for the remaining staff members.

Another key finding of the present study was the significant relationship between job satisfaction and migration tendency. It was found that nurses who expressed a higher level of job satisfaction were less tendency to migrate. The result that has been identified corresponds with data from various research reports [34,39,40]. The findings of Kamali et al.‘s (2020) study indicated that nurses exhibited a high degree of migration tendency, yet their job satisfaction levels were only moderate. The study demonstrated a negative and significant relationship between these two variables [41]. Similarly, the findings of Valizadeh et al. (2017) identified job dissatisfaction as one of the factors accelerating nurse migration [42]. Job dissatisfaction among healthcare workers has pushed them toward international labor markets and has been an influencing factor in health care provision [40]. Correspondingly, Heidari et al. (2017) confirmed that job satisfaction influences nurses’ tendency to remain at their workplaces and can improve the quality of nursing care [43].

The findings of this study demonstrated a negative and significant correlation between nurses’ perception of their economic situation and their migration tendency. In other words, the worse nurses perceived their economic situation, the stronger their migration tendency were. This result is consistent with the studies by Yürümezoğlu & Çamveren (2025) [34], Akinwale et al. (2023) [40], Toyin-Thomas et al. (2023) [39], Okafor and Chimereze (2020) [44], and Kadel et al. (2019) [22]. Kadel et al. (2019) noted that the majority (96%) of nurses in Nepal were dissatisfied with their salaries, identifying this as the primary driver of nurse migration from the country [22]. Similarly, Akinwale et al. (2023) discovered that insufficient wages had a discouraging effect on healthcare workers in Nigeria, ultimately prompting them to seek employment in the global job market [40]. Ibrahim et al. (2024) found that economic pressures, low wages, coupled with the need to offer improved family life circumstances, stood as the main drivers behind Ghanaian nurse migration [36]. Shamsi et al. (2020) identified insufficient nursing wages relative to other professions as the third leading cause of the nursing shortage in Iran, while globally, it ranked as the seventh cause, highlighting the low wage levels of Iranian nurses. Experts believe that sustainable changes require reforms in policies, regulations, and public perspectives [10]. Studies indicate that economic factors are recognized as primary predictors of migration tendency from developing to developed countries [35,45]. Therefore, in developing countries, governments need to address nurse migration through measures such as wage increases, improved working conditions, greater professional autonomy, and regulatory migration policies [44].

While our findings show a statistically significant inverse association between job satisfaction and migration tendency, it is important to conceptually distinguish between satisfaction with the nursing profession itself and satisfaction with working conditions or national context. Nurses may be committed to their profession and derive personal fulfillment from caregiving, yet still express a high desire to migrate due to economic instability, lack of professional autonomy, or broader systemic issues. Conversely, dissatisfaction with the profession itself may motivate some nurses to leave nursing altogether, rather than migrate. Future studies, especially qualitative ones, are recommended to explore these distinctions in greater depth.

The current research, similar to other studies, is subject to some limitations. The current study was a cross-sectional design and conducted in Shiraz city in 2023. So, the findings cannot be easily generalized to other time periods or other provinces or cities in Iran. Self-reported data collected through questionnaires creates the risk of response bias as a second issue. As another limitation, the timeframe of data gathering in the post-COVID-19 period can presumably affected research findings.

The present study highlighted that the majority of Iranian nurses expressed high migration tendency. Factors such as age, single marital status, negative perceptions of economic status and income, insufficient number of nurses in the wards, job dissatisfaction, and having plans to change jobs were identified as key determinants influencing nurses’ migration tendency. The findings of this study serve as a serious warning and challenge for Iran’s healthcare system, emphasizing the urgent need to address nurses’ working and living conditions. Given the severe shortage of nurses in Iran, policymakers and nursing managers should prioritize the design and implementation of appropriate interventions such as increasing payment, enhancing nursing staff numbers in healthcare facilities, improving working conditions, creating opportunities for professional advancement, and strengthening job security.
