Luminescent cerium(III) compounds with 5d-4ftransition have received extensive interest in phosphor, photocatalysis, and electroluminescence. Due to the high vacuum 5denergy level, Ce(III) compounds with emission from ultraviolet to yellow region have been well developed, while orange to deep-red emissions are scarce. In this work, we develop a series of molecular Ce(III) complexes with red to deep-red emission by using S-coordinating dithiobiuret ligands, providing new insights into long-wavelength Ce(III) emitters. The longest emission maxima are extended to 725 nm with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 31%. Furthermore, it is found that tuning on the steric hindrance yields both mononuclear and dinuclear Ce(III) complexes with different emission colors, as well as different conversion behaviors between the two structures in toluene solution. This work not only shows the great potential of S-coordinating ligands in achieving deep-red Ce(III) emitters, but also demonstrates interesting coordination chemistry of molecular Ce(III) complexes.

Luminescent cerium(III) compounds with 5d-4f transition have received extensive interest in phosphor, photocatalysis, and electroluminescence, but pushing emission beyond 700 nm is challenging. Here, the authors report a series of molecular Ce(III) complexes with S-coordinating dithiobiuret ligands that emit at 725 nm with 31% quantum efficiency.

Cerium, as a member of the lanthanide elements, has the highest crust abundance among the lanthanide series1. Among the various properties of cerium, trivalent cerium (Ce(III)) exhibits unique optical properties in the field of luminescence2,3with the radiative transition from 5d1to 4f1. Owing to the adjustability of the energy level of 5dorbitals and parity-allowedd-ftransition mechanism, numerous Ce(III) emitters with tunable emission and short excited decay lifetimes in a nanosecond scale have been reported4–8. Without the drag of the intermediate level between the 5dand 4fstate, Ce(III) emitters usually display pretty high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs, ΦPL). According to the above advantages, luminescent Ce(III) compounds have been applied to lighting, photocatalysis8,9, inkjet printing10, and electroluminescence devices5,11–13with vigorous vitality.

Restricted by the rather high vacuum 5denergy level of Ce(III) (6.35 eV14,15), most luminescent Ce(III) compounds emit light with high energy from ultraviolet to yellow12,16–18. Even in inorganic Ce(III) phosphors that have been extensively studied, orange-red emissions are not common, and the highest PLQY is 45%19. Molecular Ce(III) complexes, as a new class of Ce(III) emitters5,6,9,11,12,20–26, have gradually gained attention in recent years due to well-defined molecular structures, good solubility in organic solvents, and clear structure-activity relationships. As for now, Ce(III) complexes with longer wavelength emission are still rare, as the molecular design requires ligands with even stronger covalence and calls for strong donor ligands like cyclopentadienyl18,27,28and pyrazolate29,30, and the related research is difficult and rare. In 2018, Wickleder et al. reported a yellow-emitting Ce(III) complex [Ce(CptBu2)2(μ-Cl)]2with photoluminescence (PL) maxima of 560 nm and a PLQY of 61%18. In 2022, Taydakov et al. synthesized orange- and orange-red-emitting Ce(III) coordination polymers based on 2-pyridylpyrazole ligand29,30. With stronger bond covalence, the PL maxima of the two complexes redshift to 604 nm and 642 nm with PLQY lower than 1%, respectively. Considering the low cost of cerium element and the potential application of deep-red-emitting materials in photo detectors31, light-conversion32,33, and organic light-emitting diodes34,35, achieving efficient deep-red-emitting Ce(III) complexes through reasonable ligand design is desirable.

In inorganic Ce(III) phosphors, a combination of both nephelauxetic effects on 5dcentroid shift and crystal-field splitting is extensively applied in the design of materials with different emission wavelengths36,37. To fulfill our target, the strategies in inorganic phosphors are worth learning from, that is, both ligand skeletons with coordinating atoms having strong covalence and polarizability to enhance 5dcentroid shift, and with electron-donating groups to promote ligand-field splitting are in necessity. Inspired by the orange-red-emitting cerium sulfide38,39, the sulfur atom with high electronegativity and soft-donor properties is selected as the coordination atom to construct molecular Ce(III) complexes with deep-red emission (Fig.1a).

In this work, with the exploration of strong-donor S-coordinating dithiobiuret ligand, a series of Ce(III) complexes Ce-dtuR4with the formula of Cen[(N(CSNR2)2]3n(n= 2, R = Me, Et;n= 1, R =iPr and Cy, N(CSNR2)-is R group substituted dithiobiuret anion, shortened as dtuR4) emitting red to deep-red light were synthesized. For PL properties, the best two complexes, Ce-dtuMe4and Ce-dtuCy4, display red- and deep-red-emissions with PL maxima of 640 nm and 725 nm and PLQY of 22% and 31%, respectively (Fig.1b). For molecular structure, via tuning of the steric hindrance of the ligand, both mononuclear- and dinuclear-type Ce(III) complexes were obtained and the conversion between the two structures has also been elucidated (Fig.1c). To the best of our knowledge, this work represents new Ce(III) emitter with PL maxima exceeding 700 nm, showing the pioneering result beyond traditional cognition in the luminescence of Ce(III), as well as a unique example jumping out of classical O- or N-coordination systems.

The synthesis routes of the coordination ligands and the corresponding Ce(III) complexes are depicted in Fig.2. Starting from thiophosgene, the reaction with secondary amine yields the corresponding thiocarbamoyl chloride. The intermediate was reacted with KSCN and then secondary amine to give symmetrical 1,1,5,5-tetra-substituted dithiobiuret HdtuR4(R = Me, Et,iPr, and Cy). HdtuMe4and HdtuEt4are soluble in acetonitrile (MeCN) and were recrystallized using MeCN, while HdtuiPr4and HdtuCy4were precipitated directly as white solids during the reaction. It’s noteworthy that HdtuEt4, HdtuiPr4and HdtuCy4are not stable enough to be stored even in solid-powder state under inert gas at room temperature, as Brown et al. proposed that dithiobiuret may decompose into carbamoyl isocyanate and corresponding amines upon standing, followed by side reactions of irreversible polymerization40.

Note the data given in parentheses represents the synthesis yield. Note in the molecular structure, the Ce atoms are represented in light-yellow, S in bright yellow, N in blue, C in gray, and H in white.

The Ce(III) complexes are denoted as Ce-dtuR4(R = Me, Et,iPr, and Cy). Except for insoluble Ce-dtuMe4, which was synthesized via the acid-base reaction between HdtuMe4and Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3in MeCN to afford the pure product, all the other three complexes were synthesized by mixing the stoichiometric HdtuR4ligand, cerium triflate (Ce(OTf)3), and NaH in tetrahydrofuran (THF) via salt metathesis, followed by recrystallization, because these complexes show great solubility in low-polarity solvents like dichloromethane (DCM) and toluene (PhMe). To further verify the oxidation state of Ce in the prepared samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted for solid-powder Ce-dtuR4(R = Me, Et,iPr, and Cy) complexes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.1, all four complexes exhibit two peaks centered at about 904 eV and 885 eV, respectively, which are attributed to 3d3/2and 3d5/2of Ce(III)41, indicating the trivalent essence. Upon standing under nitrogen for several months, the four complexes are stable without observable change, while Ce-dtuEt4decomposes slowly to an unidentified orange-pink powder if there is long-term presence of alcohol solvent vapor in the glove box.

Except for the single crystal of Ce-dtuMe4being obtained during the reaction of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3and HdtuMe4, single crystals of Ce-dtuR4(R = Et,iPr, and Cy) were obtained by slowly evaporating a mixed solution of the corresponding complex in DCM/THF andn-hexane. The molecular structures of these Ce(III) complexes were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD), and the coordination geometry of the four complexes can be divided into two classes: dinuclear eight-coordinating and mononuclear six-coordinating. The crystallographic data and coordination bond lengths are shown in Supplementary Table1and Supplementary Table2. The simulated powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data using SCXRD data are shown in Supplementary Fig.2, as the complexes themselves are not stable enough in air to conduct the PXRD experiments. To better understand the molecular structure of the four complexes, the key structure parameters are shown in Table1. Here, we take Ce-dtuMe4and Ce-dtuCy4as representatives, considering the smallest and largest steric hindrance across the whole series. In dinuclear Ce-dtuMe4, the crystal belongs to the monoclinicP21/n space group. One asymmetric unit contains one Ce(III) center and three dithiobiuret ligands, indicating a completely equivalent coordination environment between the two Ce atoms. Meanwhile, the molecule exhibitsC2-symmetry and coordination geometry of dodecahedron close to tetragonal antiprism, with two different typical Ce-S bond lengths, which are derived from the bonding between Ce(III) and both the terminal ligand (Ave.(Ce-S) = 2.90 Å) and the bridging ligand (Ave.(Ce-S) = 3.04 Å), respectively. In mononuclear Ce-dtuCy4, the crystal belongs to triclinicP1¯space group. The coordination geometry can be best described as a twisted trigonal prism withC3-symmetry, and the average Ce-S bond length is 2.84 Å. Compared with dinuclear Ce-dtuMe4, the shorter bond length in Ce-dtuCy4implies a stronger interaction between the central metal and coordinating atoms.

The structure change of these Ce(III) complexes from dinuclear to mononuclear occurs during the variation of the substituent from ethyl to iso-propyl on the dithiobiuret ligand. As shown in Supplementary Fig.3, Ce-dtuEt4exhibits a similar but more asymmetric dinuclear structure with Ce-dtuMe4; As for Ce-dtuiPr4, the mononuclear structure is nearly identical to its Ce-dtuCy4analog. In other words, at least secondary carbon substituents should be attached to N atoms to provide sufficient steric hindrance to obtain mononuclear complexes. In addition, we also tried to synthesize ligands with tertiary carbon substituents and aromatic substituents, such as tert-butyl and phenyl, but the synthesis route didn’t work, as either the large steric hindrance or the electron-withdrawing groups may impede the nucleophilic substitution at the first step.

WhereNrepresents the coordination numbers, which are 8 and 6 for Ce-dtuMe4and Ce-dtuCy4, respectively;αspis the spectroscopic polarizability related to coordination atoms and can be seen as identical in the two complexes;Reffis treated as the average coordination bond length in the two molecular complexes. Thus,εC(Ce-dtuCy4)/εC(Ce-dtuMe4) ≈ 0.985, indicating a similar centroid shift on 5din the two complexes. The ligand-field splitting is directly related to coordination geometry, and the splitting energy in a twisted trigonal prism (Ce-dtuCy4) is similar to that in an octahedron42, which is about 1.26 times higher than that in a dodecahedron (Ce-dtuMe4)43. That is, larger splitting energy instead of centroid shift on 5dfinally lowers the lowest 5denergy level in Ce-dtuCy4, resulting in a redshifted emission maximum to 725 nm. To further elucidate the essence of thed-ftransition, Gaussian peak fitting of the PL spectra was conducted. As shown in Supplementary Fig.6, the emission peak of both complexes can be fitted into double peaks with an energy difference of about 1.8 × 103cm−1, which corresponds to the transition from the 5dexcited state to two 4fsublevels,2F5/2and2F7/2. Additionally, the excited-state lifetimes in solid-powder state are determined to be 37 ns and 53 ns for Ce-dtuMe4and Ce-dtuCy4(Fig.3c), respectively. We are also interested in the luminescence efficiency of these emitters, and their PLQYs are measured to be 22% and 31%. That is, Ce(III) complexes not only show high efficiency with short-wavelength emission as works of literature reported4,5,8,23,44, but also exhibit great performance in the red to deep-red region with rational molecule design.

Excitation wavelength: Ce-dtuMe4: 450 nm; Ce-dtuEt4: 500 nm; Ce-dtuiPr4: 490 nm; Ce-dtuCy4: 500 nm. The excitation source used for PL decay measurement is EPL475.

For the other two complexes, Ce-dtuEt4and Ce-dtuiPr4, we will briefly discuss their PL properties. Upon directf-dexcitation, Ce-dtuEt4exhibits weak red emission with PL maxima of 670 nm, and the excited-state lifetime cannot be determined reliably due to the weak luminescence. The Gaussian peak fitting indicates two emission peaks centered at 630 nm and 725 nm (Supplementary Fig.6), which is similar to the result of Ce-dtuMe4. The more asymmetric molecular structure and higher average atomic displacement parameters (ADP) of sulfur atoms (ADP = 0.0266) compared with its methyl analog (ADP = 0.0245) indicate a lower rigidity and open up more vibrational quenching channels45,46, which may account for the low efficiency. Ce-dtuiPr4just displays nearly identical PL maxima at 725 nm to its Ce-dtuCy4analog, suggesting an external alkyl group has little impact on the 5denergy difference. However, the smaller steric hindrance of substituents makes Ce-dtuiPr4easier for Ce(III) centers to interact with the external environment, as well as its slightly lower PLQY of 20% compared with Ce-dtuCy4, and as discussed before in other literature using guanidinate as anion ligands23, a more rigid molecular skeleton brings smaller stokes shift and higher efficiency when comparing Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4.

At 77 K, the PL spectra of the four complexes in solid-powder state can be well divided into two categories: Dinuclear Ce-dtuMe4and Ce-dtuEt4exhibit orange-red emission, and mononuclear Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4show deep-red emission. Between the dinuclear complexes, both share highly resembled PL maxima (Fig.3d), and a more obvious double-peak emission was observed in Ce-dtuEt4. According to Gaussian peak-fitting, the PL maxima of the 5d→ 4f(2F5/2) peak are similar in these two complexes (Me: 632 nm; Et: 644 nm) (Supplementary Fig.7). In addition, the excited-state lifetimes are determined to be 85 ns and 74 ns for the two complexes, respectively. Mononuclear Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4display almost the same PL spectra with emission maxima of 725 nm. Meanwhile, the excited-state lifetimes of the two complexes at 77 K are slightly shorter than those of the dinuclear complexes, with values of 58 ns and 70 ns, respectively (Fig.3e).

The UV-vis absorption spectra (Supplementary Fig.8) of only three Ce-dtuR4(R = Et,iPr, and Cy) complexes were conducted in PhMe solution since Ce-dtuMe4is insoluble in common organic solvents. The absorption spectra display similar absorption characteristics in these complexes with a strong absorption band ascribed to ligand transition and one weakf-dband (spin- and parity-allowed 4f1→ 5d1) of Ce(III). The molar extinction coefficients (ε) of thesef-dbands are about 3 × 102M−1·cm−1, as the other literature reported6,47. Among them, thef-dbands are within different positions: Absorption of the dinuclear Ce-dtuEt4lies in the range of 420–450 nm, as it is covered by strong ligand absorption; the other two mononuclear complexes exhibit apparent redshiftedf-dmaxima of 480 nm and 500 nm for Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4, respectively.

In addition, to ensure the reliability of the PL data for these complexes in the solution state, we monitored the change of the UV-vis absorption spectra of the three soluble complexes Ce-dtuR4(R = Et,iPr, and Cy) during an 8 h period. As shown in Fig.4a–c, the intensity of thef-dabsorption peaks in all three complexes remained nearly unchanged within 3 h, and exhibits slight degradation after 8 h. The absorbance was selected at thef-dabsorption maxima for each complex, and the detailed data are listed in Supplementary Table3. It’s clear to see that Ce-dtuCy4is the easiest to degrade. Considering the measurements in solution can be conducted within 1 h, the above results indicate the complexes are stable enough for a short-period PL measurement using freshly prepared solutions.

Subsequently, the redox behaviors of these complexes in solution were characterized by studying their cyclic voltammetry (CV) in DCM solutions (10−3M), as the electrolyte [nBu4N][PF6] is not soluble in PhMe. The three complexes exhibit one oxidation peak near 0 V and one at about 0.80 V vs ferrocene redox couple (Fc0/+) (Supplementary Fig.9), indicating their similar redox behaviors. Meanwhile, both oxidations are irreversible for the three complexes according to the cyclic voltammograms. Among the series, Ce-dtuEt4becomes the easiest to oxidize, as the first oxidation peak occurs at about −0.13 V, while those of the other two complexes are 0.16 V (Ce-dtuiPr4) and 0.00 V (Ce-dtuCy4) vs Fc0/+, respectively.

Where kBand T represent the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively; η is the viscosity of the deuterated solvent at measuring temperature (0.554 mPa·s for PhMe at 298 K48,49). Thus, therHare determined to be 5.60 Å, 6,31 Å, and 7.89 Å for Ce-dtuEt4, Ce-dtuiPr4, and Ce-dtuCy4, respectively. Compared with the results obtained from crystal structure (9.61 Å, 7.63 Å, and 9.03 Å determined by the distance from the center of gravity to the farthest atom), the obvious radius difference between Ce-dtuEt4in solution and crystal (dinuclear structure), as well as the almost identical values of Ce-dtuEt4and Ce-dtuiPr4in solution strongly support the mononuclear structure of Ce-dtuEt4in PhMe solution (Fig.5b, c), as ethyl and iso-propyl contribute similarly to the radius. That is to say, Ce-dtuEt4experienced a chemical structure conversion from dinuclear to mononuclear when dissolved in PhMe, and the 725 nm emission in solution originates from the mononuclear structure species.

DOSY: diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy. PhMe: toluene.

The excited-state lifetimes of these complexes in PhMe (10-3M) at 293 K are determined to be 3.3 ns, 51 ns, and 60 ns for Ce-dtuEt4, Ce-dtuiPr4, and Ce-dtuCy4(Supplementary Fig.10b), respectively. The scale in tens of nanoseconds with mono-exponential decay behavior reveals thed-ftransition essence of the Ce(III) emitters in PhMe solution. We are also interested in the luminescence efficiency of these deep-red emitters in PhMe solution, and the PLQYs of Ce-dtuEt4, Ce-dtuiPr4, and Ce-dtuCy4are measured to be 1%, 17%, and 27%, slightly lower than the values in solid-powder state. As a supplement, the radiative decay rate (kr) and the non-radiative decay rate (knr) could also be derived using the equationskr= ФPL/τand 1/τ=kr+knr, and the photophysical data are summarized and listed in Table2for comparison in both solid-powder and solution states. It’s clear to see a significantly fasterknrin Ce-dtuEt4compared with the other two complexes in PhMe solutions, which may be due to the ethyl group with less steric hindrance and less rigidity, leading to an easier access for the solvent to interact with the Ce(III) center.

b: The values in parentheses represent the emission maxima from 5dto two 4fsublevels (2F5/2and2F7/2) obtained from Gaussian peak fitting.

d:τ,kr, andknrrepresent the excited-state lifetime, radiative decay rate, and non-radiative decay rate, respectively.

We further measured the PL spectra of the three complexes in PhMe solution at 77 K for deeper insight. For Ce-dtuEt4, a large blueshift compared to the spectrum at 293 K is observed, showing a PL maximum at 600 nm under 350 nm excitation (Fig.5d). The mono-exponential decay with an excited-state lifetime of 103 ns supports thed-fessence of the emission band. Different excitation wavelengths, such as 365 nm, 425 nm, and 490 nm, were also used, but no emission band centered at 725 nm was observed (Supplementary Fig.20). In this context, considering the mono- and di-nuclear structures could be tuned by the steric hindrance of the alkyl group, we suggest the coordination structure of Ce-dtuEt4in PhMe solution is temperature-dependent as well, and low temperature could stabilize the dinuclear structure to induce high energy emission (600 nm).

The low-temperature behavior of the other two complexes, Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4, differs from dtuEt4. Under 350 nm excitation, Ce-dtuiPr4exhibits similar PL spectra with Ce-dtuEt4, while a difference lies in the tail at 800–1000 nm in the spectrum (Fig.5e). Under 500 nm excitation, the 725 nm emission emerged as the main component (Supplementary Fig.21), which indicates the existence of two luminescence species (600 nm and 725 nm) under the experiment condition and explains that the aforementioned tail is the 725 nm emission. Compared to the excitation-independent emission of Ce-dtuEt4centered at 600 nm, the excitation-dependent emission of Ce-dtuiPr4indicates the concurrent existence of mononuclear and dinuclear structures at 77 K. Subsequently, for Ce-dtuCy4with larger steric hindrance, the 600 nm emission just manifests as a small band, and 725 nm emission becomes dominant under 350 nm excitation (Fig.5f), implying the fact that Ce-dtuCy4is more difficult to become a dinuclear structure. Furthermore, monitoring of both emissions at 600 nm and 725 nm yields two different excitation spectra and excited-state lifetimes as well (Supplementary Fig.22), which strongly supports the existence of two luminescent species in the PhMe solutions of both Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4at 77 K. Therefore, through the complexes from Ce-dtuEt4to Ce-dtuiPr4and Ce-dtuCy4, a gradually increased steric hindrance yields complete to lower 600 nm component (i.e. dinuclear structure component), indicating the structure conversion is also temperature-dependent in solution (Fig.5g).

In summary, deep-red Ce(III) emitters with PL maxima exceeding 700 nm has been synthesized and characterized using S-coordinating dithiobiuret ligands. By applying different steric hindrances, dinuclear and mononuclear Ce(III) complexes were obtained with red and deep-red emissions, respectively, due mainly to different splitting energies rather than the centroid shift of the 5dorbital. Among them, the best two complexes, dinuclear Ce-dtuMe4and mononuclear Ce-dtuCy4, exhibit red emission centered at 640 nm and deep-red emission centered at 725 nm with PLQY of 22% and 31%, respectively. The exciting result exceeds the common understanding of the emission color of Ce(III) compounds, which may raise new attention in designing red to near-infraredd-femitters. Furthermore, temperature-dependent PL spectra suggest different chemical structure conversions between monomer and dimer in these Ce(III) complexes, revealing interesting coordination chemistry among these unique complexes. This work not only demonstrates the pioneering use of S-coordinating ligands in lanthanide Ce(III) complexes, but also reveals the huge potential of Ce(III) to construct highly efficient deep-red, even near-infrared emitters.

All synthesis experiments were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. All chemical reagents used in the synthesis process were commercially available and were used as received unless otherwise mentioned. The synthesis and purification of Ce(III) complexes were carried out in a glove box. Ce(OTf)3was dried under vacuum at 180 °C prior to use. The solvents used to synthesize the complexes were specially treated: THF, PhMe, tol-d8, andn-hexane were dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled under an argon atmosphere; DCM and MeCN were dried over calcium hydride and freshly distilled under an argon atmosphere. Powder-state NaH was prepared by washing commercially available 60% NaH withn-hexane (3 × 20 mL) in a glovebox. All glasswares were oven-dried at 120 °C for at least 1 h before use.

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal reference for the chemical shift correction, where δ(TMS) equals 0. The13C NMR spectra and DOSY NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-500 MHz NMR spectrometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were performed in negative ion mode on a Bruker Apex IV Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The infrared spectrum (IR) of the product (KBr pellets) was recorded using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet Is50, ThermoFisher) in the range of 400–4000 cm−1the results are shown in Supplementary Figs.23–24. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed on an AXIS Supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.

After the addition, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for a further 45 min. The amine hydrochloride was filtered off and washed with 20 mL THF. The brown filtrate was combined, and the solvent was removed in vacuo to afford a brown solid, which was washed withn-hexane (3 × 20 mL) to give pale-brown to off-white crystalline powder.
