Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeting radioligands have gained attention for the ability to image multiple tumor types. Current FAP-targeting radioligands are labeled with68Ga and18F, but their short half-lives limit distribution range after production and later time-point imaging. This study describes the development Kalios, a novel class of NODAGA-conjugated FAP-targeting radioligands labeled with the cyclotron-produced Copper-61 (t1/2= 3.33 h), for greater temporal range for FAP-targeted imaging.

Four Kalios ligands were synthesized and radiolabeled with [61Cu]CuCl2in high yield and radiochemical purity within 5 min at room temperature. All radioligands demonstrated high hydrophilicity and strong affinity for FAP, and were primarily internalized after incubation with FAP-positive cells. PET/CT images obtained at 0–1 h and 4 h post-injection (p.i.) illustrated accumulation of all radioligands in FAP-positive tumors. Biodistribution studies of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 demonstrated stable tumor uptake between 1 and 4 h p.i., with washout from normal tissues at 4 h, resulting in improved tumor-to-background ratios.

Kalios ligands represent a new class of FAP-targeting61Cu-labeled radioligands. The half-life of61Cu allowed delayed 4-h imaging with improved tumor-to-background ratios. The improved delayed imaging and greater distribution range of these61Cu-labeled FAP-targeting radioligands demonstrates their clear potential for clinical translation, while combination with the therapeutic twin67Cu allows for truly paired Kalios theranostics.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and essential part of solid tumors characterized by the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressing fibroblast activation protein (FAP) (Wright et al.2023). FAP is overexpressed in various epithelial tumors, including breast, lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer diagnosis and therapy (Arcucci et al.2016; Busek et al.2018).

Radiolabeled FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) have shown significant promise in non-invasive PET imaging of FAP expression in multiple cancers (Kratochwil et al.2019; Huang et al.2022). A number of FAP-targeted PET radioligands have been developed, with the vast majority bearing the quinoline scaffold UAMC1110 (Jansen et al.2014) as binding motif. Among them, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 being the most widely used so far (Mori et al.2023a).

To date, FAP-targeted PET radioligands are labeled with68Ga or18F. However, the relatively short half-lives of68Ga (t1/2= 68 min) and18F (t1/2= 110 min) have physical limitations. First, the short half-lives limit the distribution range of produced radioligands. As many medical centers are not in proximity to production sites, there are substantial gaps in geographic availability of these agents. Second, the clinical utility of FAP-targeting agents is often compromised by undesired accumulation in non-tumor sites, for example degenerative tissues or inflamed tissues such as bursitis and fibrosis. This hampers diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, especially at early time points (Backhaus et al.2022).

We suggest that FAP-targeting radioligands with longer effective half-lives can overcome these physical limitations. Copper-61 (61Cu) has emerged as a potential clinically relevant positron-emitter radionuclide with a longer half-life (t1/2= 3.33 h).61Cu allows both large scale cyclotron production (like18F), as well as chelator-based radiochemistry (like68Ga). The 3.33 h half-life of61Cu would allow distribution of produced agents over 500 miles, allowing just 10 production sites to supply61Cu-labeled radioligands to the Unites States or Europe (Mario et al.2021). The longer half-life of61Cu would also allow later time point imaging, which could be beneficial if the radioligand demonstrates preferential washout from non-tumor tissues. The lower positron energy of61Cu (maximum 1.22 MeV) than68Ga (maximum 1.90 MeV) will decrease positron range and increase resolution of61Cu agents compared to68Ga agents (Fonseca et al.2022; Sanchez-Crespo2013).61Cu could be paired with the beta particles emitting67Cu (t1/2= 2.58 days, Eβ−mean= 141 keV, Eβ−max= 562 keV), allowing the production of truly paired theranostic imaging and therapy radioligands (Krasnovskaya et al.2023).

61Cu has traditionally not been widely used in PET radioligands due to low radionuclide purity, low yields, and lack of availability (Fani and Nicolas2023). With recent development of procedures for isolating [61Cu]CuCl2from cyclotron irradiated nickel targets, high quality61Cu is now available for labeling PET radioligands (Fonseca et al.2022; Svedjehed et al.2020).

In this work, we describe the development and characterization of four novel FAP-targeted ligands, named Kalios-01, Kalios-02, Kalios-01 M, and Kalios-02 M, chemically optimized to increase the tumor retention time and incorporating the chelator NODAGA for61Cu labeling for PET imaging. The in vitro and in vivo performance of the four [61Cu]Cu-Kalios ligands was evaluated and compared with the commonly used FAP-targeted ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46.

The production and purification of [61Cu]CuCl2,together with the synthesis and HPLC profile of the ligands, logDdetermination, in vitro assays,and PET-CT details are described in theSupplemental Information.

The FAP-binding moiety (S)-6-amino-N-(2-(2-cyano-4,4-difluoropyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxoethyl)quinoline-4-carboxamide was coupled to succinic acid in order to allow further linker modifications. The free carboxylic acid was elongated withtert-butyl (2-aminoethyl)carbamate ortert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate which, following the hydrolysis of the Boc protective group, were coupled to the NODAGA chelator to generate Kalios-01 and Kalios-02, respectively. Kalios-01 M and Kalios-02 M, which bear a methylation on the amine in position 6 of the quinoline ring, were purchased from WuXi AppTec. The structures of the novel FAP ligands are shown in Fig.1A. FAPI-46 was synthesized by following the literature: A schematic representation of the synthesis of Kalios-01 and Kalios-02, together with further synthetic details, are described in Supplemental Fig.1.

61Cu-labeled conjugates were prepared by incubating 1.5–3 nmol of the corresponding conjugate (as a 1 mg/mL solution) in 125–300 µL of ammonium acetate (0.5 M, pH 8) with 50–200 µL of [61Cu]CuCl2(5–70 MBq). A pH check was performed to guarantee the necessary conditions for the reaction (pH ≥ 5). The reaction mixture was incubated for 8 min at room temperature. Quality control and stability studies were performed by Radio-HPLC on a Shimadzu SCL-40 connected to a GABI radioactivity-HPLC-flow-monitor γ-spectrometer (Elysia-raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Radioligands were analyzed using Phenomenex Jupiter Proteo C12 (90 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm) column using the gradient 15–80% B in 8 min (A = H2O [0.1%TFA], B = ACN [0.1% TFA]) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The retention time of the radioligands is described in Fig.1B. ThenatCu complexes were prepared by incubating 1–1.5 mg of each conjugate with 1.5-fold excess ofnatCuCl2under the same condition described above for the61Cu-complexes. Free metal ions were eliminated via HPLC (Shimadzu SCL-40, Phenomenex Jupiter Proteo C12 (90 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm) column using the gradient 15–80% B in 15 min (A = H2O [0.1%TFA], B = ACN [0.1% TFA]) with a flow rate of 5 ml/min). Radiolabeling conditions and retention time of all studied radioligands are presented in Table S1.

LogD(pH = 7.4) determination of the61Cu-labeled radioligands was performed by the shake-flask method, as described in theSupplemental Information. The distribution coefficient was calculated as the average log ratio value of the radioactivity in the organic fraction and PBS fraction. The results are presented in Fig.1B and Figure S2.

The enzymatic activity of hFAP on the substrate Z-Gly-Pro-AMC was measured at room temperature on a microtiter plate reader, monitoring the fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. The assay was performed by mixing the substrate (20 μM), hFAP (200 pM, constant), and the inhibitors in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH = 7.5), with serial dilution of the inhibitors ranging from 250 nM to 2 fM, 1:2 in a total volume of 20 μL. FAPI-46 was used as positive control. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean fluorescence values were fitted using Graph Pad Prism 9 (equation used: Y = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(1 + ((X^HillSlope)/(IC50^HillSlope)))). The IC50value is defined as the concentration of inhibitor required to reduce the enzyme activity by 50% after the addition of the substrate. The results are presented in Fig.1C and Table S2.

Upon thawing, HT-1080.hFAP, HT-1080.wt and HEK-293.hFAP cells were kept in culture in MEM medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, FBS) and Penicillin–Streptomycin (1%) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For passaging, cells were detached using Trypsin–EDTA 0.05% when reaching 90% confluency and re-seeded at a dilution of 1:4/1:12 (HT-1080) or 1:10/1:20 (HEK-293).

HT-1080.hFAP and HT-1080.wt cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a concentration of 1.8 × 105cells/well in 400 µL of medium 24 h before the experiment. The cells were then preconditioned in 360 µL of assay medium (MEM medium without supplements) at 37 °C for 60 min. Forty µL of a 2 nM solution of61Cu-labeled radioligand was added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. Cellular uptake was interrupted at different time points (15 min, 1 h and 4 h), by washing twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell surface-bound radioligand was obtained by washing cells twice with ice-cold glycine buffer (pH 2.8), followed by a collection of the internalized fraction with 1 M NaOH. The activity in each fraction was measured in a γ-counter (Cobra II). The results are expressed as a percentage of the applied radioactivity, after subtracting the non-specific uptake in the HT-1080.wt cells (Fig.2A and Table S3).

The association profiles of Kalios radioligands were studied at different concentrations, ranging from 0.075 to 50 nM, in HEK-293.hFAP cell membranes at 37 °C. Preparation of the membrane is described in theSupplemental information. Each assay tube contained 170 μL of binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 4 mM MgCl2, 0.2% BSA, 20 mg/L bacitracin, 20 mg/L PMSF and 200,000 KIU/L aprotinin). The incubation was initiated by adding 30 μL of radioligand solution at 10 times the final concentration and 100 μL of cell membrane suspension to yield 10 μg of protein per well. For the determination of the non-specific binding, 140 μL of the above binding buffer was added along with 30 μL of FAPI-46 to obtain (0.1 mM). Bound fractions were plotted versus the corresponding radioligand concentration at equilibrium. The dissociation constant (KD) and maximal binding capacity (Bmax) values were calculated using GraphPad Software Inc., Prism 7, San Diego, CA, USA (Fig.2B and Table S4).

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with Swiss animal welfare laws and regulations under the license number 30515 granted by the Veterinary Office (Department of Health) of the Canton Basel-Stadt.

Female athymic nude-Foxn1nu/Foxn1+ mice (Envigo, The Netherlands), 4–6 weeks old, were injected subcutaneously with 5–10 × 106of HT-1080.hFAP cells suspended in 100 μL of PBS on the right shoulder or on the right flank, while 5–10 × 106HT-1080.wt cells suspended in 100 μL of PBS were injected on the contralateral shoulder or flank. The tumors were allowed to grow to an average volume of 100–200 mm3.

PET/CT images were acquired using the β-CUBE PET scanner system (Molecubes, Gent, Belgium), decay corrected and reconstructed with the Molecubes software version 4.0. Mice bearing both FAP-positive and FAP-negative (double xenograft) were injected intravenously with61Cu-labeled Kalios (100 μL/500 pmol/8–12 MBq). Mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and dynamic PET scans were acquired during 1 h upon injection of the radioligand. The mice were euthanized by CO2at 4 h p.i., and static PET scans were acquired for 30 min. Mice were imaged supine, feet first. Topograms and helical CT scans of the whole mouse were first acquired (Fig.3). PET scans of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 (100 µL/500 pmol/5 MBq) were acquired in a dynamic mode 0-1 h p.i. for direct comparison. Details about Topograms and helical CT scans, together with PET and CT images reconstruction parameters and the dynamic scan frame (0-1 h) and the percentage of remaining activity in the body 4 h p.i. are described in theSupplemental information, Figures S3-S7 and Table S5.

The double xenografted mice were randomized (n = 5 per group) and injected intravenously via the tail vein with the61Cu-labeled radioligands (100 µL/500 pmol/0.8-1 MBq). [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 (100 µL/500 pmol/1 MBq) was assessed for comparison. Mice were euthanized 1 h and 4 h p.i. by CO2asphyxiation. Organs of interest and blood were collected, rinsed of excess blood, blotted dry, weighed, and counted in a γ-counter. The samples were counted against a suitably diluted aliquot of the injected solution as the standard and the results are expressed as the percentage of the injected activity per gram of tissue (%I.A./g) ± SD (Fig.4A–E and Table S6). The tumor-to-organ ratios of all the radioligands are presented in Fig.5A–C. A mass escalation study was performed for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 by injecting 1.5, 5 and 10 nmol in HT-1080.hFAP bearing mice. The results are presented in Table S7.

The FAP-binding moiety (S)-6-amino-N-(2-(2-cyano-4,4-difluoropyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxoethyl)quinoline-4-carboxamide was coupled to succinic acid. Elongation of the free carboxylic acid with diethylamine or piperazine and further coupling with NODAGA allowed the generation of Kalios-01 and Kalios-02, respectively. Kalios-01M and Kalios-02M were purchased from WuXi AppTech and used as delivered. All the ligands were obtained in high purity. The structures are shown in Fig.1A.

All61Cu-labeled ligands were prepared with apparent molar activity ranging from 5 up to 25 MBq/nmol, depending on the study, and radiochemical purity ≥ 95%.

The N-methylation of Kalios-01M and Kalios-02M did not have a significant impact on the lipophilicity when compared with the non-methylated ligands Kalios-01 and Kalios-02 (logD= -3.09 ± 0.08 versus -3.17 ± 0.28 for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M versus [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01, and -3.11 ± 0.15 versus -3.32 ± 0.39 for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02, respectively). The reference ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 presented similar logDvalue (3.01 ± 0.18). As expected, a very similar retention time of the radioligands was observed (R.t. = 6.2 min versus 5.9 min for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01, and 6.4 min versus 6.1 min for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02, respectively) (Fig.1B).

All the new ligands showed excellent inhibition properties of hFAP (Fig.1C).natCu-Kalios-01 showed the lowest inhibitory activity, followed bynatCu-Kalios-02, [natCu]Cu Kalios-02M, andnatCu-Kalios-01M, which presented the lowest calculated IC50(IC50= 141.3, 120.5, 105.1 and 40.1 pM, respectively) (Table S2).

Cellular distribution analysis revealed that all four Kalios ligands displayed comparable surface bound fraction, which was less than 2%. However, significant variations in their internalization rates were observed: at 4 h, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 exhibited the highest internalization rate of 39.4%, while [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M exhibited similar internalization profiles (29.3% and 28.3%, respectively). [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M demonstrated a comparatively lower internalization rate of 17.4%. (Fig.2A and Table S3).

The Bmax(maximum binding capacity) and KD(dissociation constant) values of all the radioligands were determined through a saturation experiment on HEK-293.hFAP membranes. [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M showed the highest Bmaxvalue (9.1–9.8 nM), followed by [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 (8.6–9.2 nM), [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M (7.7–8.4 nM) and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 (7.3–8.1 nM).

[61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 was found to be the radioligand with the highest affinity (lowest KDvalue), followed by [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M (KD= 1.2–1.8 nM, 1.4–2.0 nM, 1.7–2.2 nM, and 3.0–3.9 nM, respectively) (Fig.2B and Table S4).

The visual assessment of PET/CT images at 0–1 h (dynamic) (Figures S3-S6) and at 1 and 4 h (static) p.i. (Fig.3) showed accumulation of all radioligands in the FAP-positive (HT-1080.hFAP) tumors, with no accumulation in FAP-negative (HT-1080.wt) tumors. Visually, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 showed the highest FAP-positive tumor uptake 1 h p.i., while [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M presented the lowest. All the radioligands accumulated in the joints, with [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 showing the highest uptake at 1 h p.i. The tumor-to-background contrast increased at 4 h p.i. for all the radioligands, with [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 showing the best contrast. However, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 showed highest background activity at 4 h p.i., which is in agreement with the remaining activity in the body (18.4% of the injected activity at 4 h p.i.), in comparison all the other radioligands (Table S5).

The ex vivo quantitative biodistribution at 1 h and 4 h p.i. showed differences between the radioligands. The tumor uptake at 1 h p.i. followed the order [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 > [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 ~ [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M > [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 ~ [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M (12.6 vs 7.9 vs 7.4 vs 3.9 vs 3.5%I.A./g). However, after 4 h the tumor uptake followed the order [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 ~ [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 > [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01M ~ [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M > [68GaGa-FAPI-46 (7.1 vs 6.4 vs 4.0 vs 3.0 vs 1.3%I.A./g). Interestingly, the higher the tumor uptake, the higher the femur uptake (e.g., 10.9%I.A./g for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01, at 1 h p.i.) (Fig.4and Table S6).

Concerning total body distribution and pharmacokinetics, most of the radioligands showed similar tumor-to-background ratios between 1 and 4 h p.i., with the exception of the [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 which showed an improved tumor-to-background ratio at 4 h p.i.. Contrary, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-01 presented the worst ratios (Fig.5).

A mass escalation study performed with [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 showed reduced uptake in all FAP-positive organs, including the FAP-expressing tumors, when the dose increased from 0.5 to 10 nmol (Table S7).

This study designed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo four61Cu-labeled FAP-targeted PET radioligands: Kalios-01 and Kalios-02, along with their methylated derivatives, Kalios-01M and Kalios-02M. [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 demonstrated the highest tumor-to-background ratios in vivo, which were improved at 4-h imaging compared to 1-h imaging. This demonstrates the advantage that the 3.33 h half-life of61Cu may provide for FAP-targeted imaging, as well as the excellent potential for clinical translation of the Kalios agents.

Copper radioisotopes are valuable for both molecular imaging and therapy, as they offer the potential for true theranostic applications. The positron-emitting isotopes61Cu (t1/2= 3.33 h) and64Cu (t1/2= 12.7 h) can be paired with the β⁻-emitting67Cu, enabling diagnostic and therapeutic integration.64Cu is used in PET imaging tracers (e.g., [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE) benefiting from its commercial availability (IAEA2022). Its longer half-life compared to68Ga and18F facilitates broader distribution and allows for delayed imaging. However, its relatively low positron yield (18%) may limit image quality, and its significant β⁻ emission (39%) increases radiation exposure. In contrast,61Cu offers a higher positron yield (61%) while maintaining a favorable half-life, and it lacks the high-energy β⁻ emissions associated with64Cu, potentially improving imaging performance while reducing radiation burden (Williams et al.2005).

The four Kalios ligands were rationally designed to modulate the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of FAPI-46, while preserving its lipophilicity, a key factor for optimal FAPI targeting (Loktev et al.2019). These ligands introduce the previously unreported amide moiety attached at position 6 of the 6-aminoquinoline core, with the amine either methylated (Kalios-01M, Kalios-02M) or non-methylated (Kalios-01, Kalios-02). The introduction of an amide moiety at position 6 of the 6-aminoquinoline core differentiates the Kalios ligands from existing FAP-targeted radioligands, as it may enhance binding affinity by stabilizing interactions with FAP. Additionally, methylation could influence in vivo clearance and metabolic stability, potentially affecting ligand retention and imaging contrast. Furthermore, it retains lipophilicity and enables convenient conjugation with the NODAGA chelator, which was identified as an ideal chelating moiety forxCu-labeled radioligands (Fani et al.2011). The synthesis of the novel ligands was successfully performed, resulting in high-purity material. Radiolabeling with61Cu via the chelator NODAGA allowed labeling at room temperature, without the need of a post-labeling purification step, and radiochemical purity ≥ 95% for all four [61Cu]Cu-Kalios. Importantly, this process enables the straightforward use of kit formulation for simple manufacturing of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios in medical centres.

In vitro characterization of the Kalios ligands revealed similar lipophilicity and a very high inhibition property and affinity to hFAP, in the same range as FAPI-46. After 4 h, distinct internalization profiles were observed, with [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 and [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02M showing 39.4% and 17.4% internalization, respectively, when using the total applied activity as the reference (100%). However, when considering the cell-associated uptake (cell surface + internalized activity) as the reference (100%), the internalized fraction for all four [61Cu]Cu-Kalios ligands reached 95–97%, in line with the reported values for [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (94.8%) and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 (97.8%) at the same time point (Loktev et al.2019). Allnat/61Cu-complexed Kalios showed excellent affinity for hFAP, with IC50values in sub-namomolar range in an enzymatic assay.natGa-FAPI-46 was reported to have an IC50of 8.4 nM, determined via the same assay (Backhaus et al.2022). While no blocking experiments using cold (natural copper-labeled) Kalios compounds were performed in this study, the quinoline-based FAP-binding warhead is derived from UAMC1110 and structurally conserved across the Kalios ligands and other FAPIs. This scaffold has been extensively validated for FAP specificity and high affinity in multiple studies (Jansen et al.2014; Backhaus et al.2022; Mori et al.2023b; Millul et al.2023; Loktev et al.2018). A direct comparison between the KDand Bmaxvalues of the [nat/61Cu]Cu-Kalios ligands with reported values in the literature is challenging due to the differences in cell lines, most being transduced with different levels of FAP expression. Nevertheless, all [nat/61Cu]Cu-Kalios ligands showed excellent binding properties in vitro.

PET/CT imaging in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated selective accumulation of all [61Cu]Cu-Kalios agents in FAP-expressing tumors, with negligible uptake in FAP-negative tumors. Among the tested compounds, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 exhibited the highest tumor uptake at 1 h p.i., and the most favorable tumor retention at 4 h p.i., suggests potential for late-time PET imaging windows.

A key finding of our study is the improved tumor-to-background contrast of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02, compared to the clinically used [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46, particularly at 4 h p.i.. While absolute tumor uptake values provide insight into ligand accumulation, the tumor-to-background ratio remains a critical parameter, as it directly impacts in the detection rate and image sensitivity, but also in the therapeutic index in case of radioligand therapy.

Importantly, the tumor uptake of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 decreased by only 19% from 1 to 4 h p.i. In contrast, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 showed a 67% drop between the two time points. This difference in the tumor residence translates into a significantly higher (p < 0.0001) tumor-to-background ratio for [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 over time. Furthermore, it supports the use of Kalios-02 in combination with the therapeutic twin67Cu ([67Cu]Cu-Kalios-02) for FAP-targeting radioligand therapy.

The above findings highlight the significant advantages of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 over [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46: substantially slower tumor washout and superior tumor-to-background contrast, the combination of which results in a favorable imaging window at later time points. Overall, the pharmacokinetic profile of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02, characterized by high tumor retention and rapid background clearance, supports its application as an improved imaging agent with potential theranostic utility. In addition to its favorable tumor-to-background ratio, [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 exhibited the highest internalization among the tested ligands, which may contribute to its prolonged tumor retention. Combined with its sub-nanomolar IC50for hFAP binding, these properties render Kalios-02 the most promising candidate among the Kalios ligands for clinical translation.

With a half-life of 3.33 h,61Cu has emerged as a promising positron-emitter for PET imaging (Fani and Nicolas2023). The extended half-life of61Cu enables delayed imaging (e.g. 2–4 h p.i.) when image contrast is higher. This may improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, especially given known FAP-positive degenerative and inflammatory processes (Backhaus et al.2022). While delayed imaging at 4 h p.i. may help differentiate tumoral uptake from inflammatory or fibrotic processes, this can also be assessed using hybrid imaging modalities, such as PET/CT or PET/MR, and should be considered in clinical practice. Furthermore, even though radionuclides with short half-lives are often more practical in the clinical routine,61Cu allows multi-time scans that enable pre-therapeutic dosimetry estimations and patient-tailored therapeutic interventions with its twin,67Cu. Additionally,61Cu enables large-scale cyclotron production, like18F, as well as chelator-based radiochemistry, including kit-based preparations, like68Ga. The advantages of61Cu are currently being explored in two clinical trials, [61Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T (Bernabeu et al.2024) in prostate cancer (NCT06736054) in comparison to18F-Piflufolastat and [61Cu]Cu-NODAGA-LM3 (NCT06455358) in patients with well differentiated bronchopulmonary and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, in comparison to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC.61Cu allows centralized production and broader distribution than18F- and68Ga-based radioligands.

A limitation of the present work is the use of transfected cell lines expressing human FAP. We, and others, have shown that depending on the tumor model the tumor uptake can vary significantly. Furthermore, xenografted mice with FAP-transfected cell lines may not be representative of FAP-targeting in human tumors. Nevertheless, most, if not all known FAP radioligands have been developed using such xenografted models. Future studies should aim to validate Kalios compounds in more translatable models, such as patient-derived xenografts (PDX), which better preserve the stromal composition and heterogeneity of human tumors and may provide a more predictive assessment of clinical outcomes.

Another translational consideration relates to the tumor retention kinetics of FAP-targeting radioligands. While [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 demonstrated improved tumor retention compared to [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46, with only a 19% decrease in tumor uptake from 1 to 4 h post-injection, the absolute residence time may still represent a limiting factor for therapeutic applications. However, emerging approaches such as hypofractionated dosing could be compatible with radioligands exhibiting moderate tumor retention, such as Kalios-02, potentially balancing therapeutic efficacy with pharmacokinetic constraints, supporting the clinical translations of [67Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 as therapeutic counterpart.

On the other hand, a strength of this study is the direct comparison between [61Cu]Cu-Kalios agents and [68Ga]-FAPI-46. The data clearly demonstrate the superior tumor-to-background ratio of [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 at 4 h p.i., supporting its potential for clinical translation. This is strengthened by the quantitative biodistribution analysis and kinetics.

This study synthesized four new FAP-targeting PET radioligands (Kalios), with facile radiochemistry due to the NODAGA chelator, and labeled with61Cu. [61Cu]Cu-Kalios-02 demonstrated the highest tumor-to-background ratios, which were improved at 4-h imaging compared to 1-h imaging. This demonstrates the advantage the relatively long 3.33 h half-life of61Cu may provide to improve FAP-targeted PET imaging. The Kalios radioligands demonstrate excellent potential for clinical translation, while61Cu and its therapeutic twin67Cu, comprise an ideal pair for FAP-targeting theranostics.
