Climate change has a significant impact on India’s ecosystem and socioeconomic structure, particularly affecting critical sectors such as agriculture and water resources. This study examines the spatiotemporal patterns and seasonality of temperature and precipitation across India from 1981 to 2021. It also investigates trends and the severity of drought events during this period, providing crucial insights for policymakers. Trends and seasonality in air temperature and precipitation were assessed using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA-5) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was calculated using the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model and CHIRPS data and validated against Climatic Research Unit (CRU) datasets. Mann–Kendall and Sen’s slope methods were used to analyze drought trends. The analysis was conducted using Google Earth Engine, R, Python, Climate Data Operators, and ArcMap. In this study, SPEI data with a 5 km spatial resolution was developed and validated through correlation maps between the estimated SPEI and CRU-SPEI raster data. The results show rising trends in both temperature and precipitation, with monthly precipitation increasing more sharply at 0.387 mm/year compared to 0.0086 °C/year for temperature. Throughout the study period, regions such as Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of the Northeast consistently exhibited lower SPEI values, indicating higher drought susceptibility in these areas. Sen’s slope analysis revealed that from 1981 to 2021, several regions including Rajasthan, western Madhya Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and northern Karnataka exhibited a significant decreasing trend in SPEI, indicating intensifying and more frequent drought conditions. These findings highlight the growing impact of climate change in India, evidenced by rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increasing droughts, emphasizing the urgent need for adaptive measures and informed policy interventions to address these climatic challenges.

Climate change is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge, characterized by persistent and significant shifts in key climatic parameters, including temperature regimes and precipitation dynamics. These changes are largely attributed to anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, which have led to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide1,2. This has resulted in global warming and has had profound impacts on various environmental and socioeconomic systems, including an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and storms3–5.

Droughts, in particular, have become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climatic change6. Drought refers to an environmental hazard marked by an extended period of dryness resulting from insufficient precipitation, and it can occur across any terrestrial region7. Droughts are typically classified into four categories: meteorological (characterized by inadequate rainfall), agricultural (marked by reduced soil moisture), hydrological (evident through decreased runoff or groundwater levels), and socioeconomic drought (reflected in reduced income and limited access to water resources)8. A recent study highlights a global escalation in both the frequency and severity of droughts, with substantial consequences for agriculture, water resources and livelihood security9. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that 2024 was one of the warmest years on record, and this trend is expected to continue, leading to more severe drought conditions worldwide10.

Droughts in India are not a new phenomenon, but their frequency and severity have increased in recent decades. For instance, the severe droughts of 1918, 1965, 1972, 2002, and 2009 rank among the most devastating in India’s history, affecting millions of people and resulting in widespread agricultural losses, water scarcity, and significant economic disruption across the country11. India, with its diverse climatic zones, is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially droughts12. The country relies heavily on the monsoon system for its water supply, agriculture, and overall economic stability. Over the past century, the average temperature in India has risen by approximately 0.7 °C, with projections suggesting that it could increase by 1.5 °C to 4.5 °C by the end of the century2,3,13. This warming has contributed to changes in the timing, intensity, and distribution of monsoon rainfall, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts across various regions14. The increasing variability and unpredictability of monsoon rainfall are major contributors to the rising frequency of droughts in India. The country has experienced several consecutive drought years, such as in 2014 and 2015, where poor monsoon seasons led to severe water crises in states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh15. These droughts have had devastating effects on agriculture, particularly in rainfed areas, which account for nearly 60% of India’s total cropped area16. The Marathwada region in Maharashtra, for example, has faced recurrent droughts over the past decade, leading to significant agrarian distress, including crop failures, farmer suicides, and mass migrations17. The 2019 drought in Maharashtra and Karnataka serves as a stark reminder of the growing intensity of droughts in India. The drought, which was caused by a significant shortfall in monsoon rainfall, resulted in severe water shortages, crop failures, and economic losses. According to a report by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the rainfall deficit in Maharashtra was 20% below normal, leading to a severe drought that affected over 20 million people15,18. The drought forced the government to implement large-scale water relief measures, including water tankers and drought relief packages, highlighting the urgent need for more sustainable water management practices19.

The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is widely used for meteorological drought assessment due to its simplicity and reliance only on precipitation data20. However, it overlooks temperature effects, which can misrepresent drought in arid regions, especially under climate change. To address this, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was developed, incorporating both precipitation and temperature for a more accurate measure of water deficit21. The Climatic Research Unit Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (CRU-SPEI) is among the most commonly utilized datasets for drought assessment; however, its relatively coarse spatial resolution of around 50 km limits its applicability for detailed national level analyses22. Consequently, most existing studies have focused on regional assessments due to the unavailability of finer resolution data23–25. With the recent development of high-resolution precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, it has become feasible to compute SPEI at a much finer resolution (5 km)26,27. This advancement has enabled researchers to generate high-resolution SPEI data for broader regions such as Africa28and Central Asia29, demonstrating improved accuracy in capturing drought events. However, similar efforts remain limited in the Indian context. The usefulness of high-resolution datasets for drought monitoring in India, given its varied climate and complex landscape, remains an important subject for further research.

This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of meteorological drought across India from 1981 to 2021 by developing a high-resolution (5 km) raster dataset of SPEI. The analysis provides a detailed assessment of how drought conditions have changed over space and time. To accurately capture drought dynamics, it is essential to first understand the long-term climatic trends, particularly changes in precipitation and temperature, as these variables are fundamental drivers of drought. By examining historical patterns of these climate variables, the study establishes a robust basis for calculating SPEI. The resulting spatiotemporal analysis not only identifies regions with persistent or increasing drought exposure but also reveals trends that may indicate the growing influence of climate change. These insights are critical for informing targeted adaptation strategies and policy interventions, especially in regions most vulnerable to the socioeconomic and environmental consequences of recurring droughts.

The study used the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model’s (GLEAM) data to calculate the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). CHIRPS is a state of the science high-resolution precipitation dataset that has quasi-global coverage, spanning the entire longitude and ranging between 50°S to 50°N in latitude30. A hybrid approach was employed to compute the ultimate CHIRPS value for every pixel in the dataset, combining both unadjusted and bias-adjusted CHIRPS data. While some studies have utilized rainfall data from IMD stations31,32, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the IMD gridded dataset (0.25° × 0.25°, approximately 25 km) limits its effectiveness for fine-scale analysis. Therefore, this study employs the CHIRPS dataset, which provides rainfall estimates at a finer spatial resolution of 0.05° (~5 km), allowing for more detailed spatial assessment. This data has become a standard tool in climate science due to its ability to provide consistent, accurate, and spatially complete rainfall data, particularly in data-scarce and topographically diverse regions30,33,34. Its performance in capturing seasonal patterns, rainfall extremes, and interannual variability has been widely validated, making it a reliable input for drought monitoring and early warning systems34–36. In this study, CHIRPS data used to compute SPEI, a widely used drought index that incorporates both precipitation and evaporative demand.

The study utilized the ERA5-Land product, distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS) of ECMWF, to analyze air temperature (LST) in the study37. This dataset offers monthly temperature values at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees (approximately 11,200 m at the equator) on a latitude/longitude Climate Modelling Grid (CMG) covering the period from January 1981 onwards. The ERA5-Land product, with its acceptable resolution and long-term availability, enables detailed assessments of LST variations and their implications for various ecosystems and human activities. Furthermore, the ERA5 dataset, provided by the C3S Climate Data Store, offers a comprehensive and high-resolution reanalysis of multiple climate variables. With a spatial resolution of approximately 31 km and hourly temporal resolution, ERA5 provides extensive information on meteorological parameters, supporting various applications, including weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and research. Its accuracy, global coverage, and long-term availability make ERA5 valuable for understanding past climate dynamics, assessing current conditions, and projecting future scenarios. Researchers, scientists, and decision-makers rely on ERA5 to gain insights into the Earth’s climate system and address the challenges of climate change.

In the study, GLEAM data was also utilized, a model that estimates global evapotranspiration (Ep) using remote sensing products38. The dataset provided by GLEAM has a spatial resolution of 0.25° and a monthly temporal resolution spanning from 1980 to 2021. To estimate Ep, the model comprises four modules: potential evaporation, rainfall interception, soil module, and stress module. GLEAM estimates Ep based on land cover, net radiation, and air temperature. Ep has been validated in multiple studies29,39, and their correlation with in-situ measurements ranges from 0.49 to 0.81. In this research, we used GLEAM’s Ep to estimate water deficit to compute SPEI from 1981 to 2021.

First, the study assessed the trend and seasonality of air temperature and precipitation across India from 1981 to 2021. The information was extracted from satellite images such as ERA-5 and CHIPRS using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of air temperature and precipitation. The time series decomposition was employed in the study. The time series decomposition aims to separate the air temperature and precipitation data into its different components, typically including trend, seasonal variations, and residual (random) fluctuations. The trend component represents the long-term changes in air temperature and precipitation over the period under study. Trend analysis techniques, such as linear regression or non-linear regression models, were applied to determine the direction and magnitude of the trend. The seasonal component captures the cyclic or recurring patterns in both rainfall and air temperature data, reflecting regular variations associated with seasons or climatic cycles. Seasonal decomposition methods, such as seasonal indices or harmonic regression, were used to identify and quantify these patterns.

Classification of SPEI values based on literature.

The results were validated by comparing the high-resolution SPEI outputs with CRU-SPEI data at 1-, 3-, and 6-month time scales. To ensure data consistency for comparison, the high-resolution results were upscaled to 50 km. This upscaling process allowed us to assess the correlation between the high-resolution SPEI and CRU-SPEI datasets both in temporal and spatial dimensions.

The Mann–Kendal is a non-parametric model widely used to find trends in meteorological time series data41,42.

When N is odd, # N is even. Hence, if N appears odd, Sen’s slope is calculated as Qmed= T (N + 1)/2. Similarly, if N seems even, SSE will be considered as Qmed= T(N/2) + T(N + 2) 2. Finally, Qmedwas calculated to obtain the trend and slope magnitude with the help of a non-parametric model. When Qi is positive, there is an increasing or upward trend, while the negative value of Qi reveals a decreasing or downward trend in time series analysis. Similarly, a zero value indicates no trend. The unit of resultant Qi would be the slope magnitude in original units per year or percent per year45. The time series SPEI data were subjected to geo-statistical analysis which was performed in R software. To identify positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing) trends in SPEI and slope magnitude (Q), the Mann–Kendall and Sen’s slope methods were employed.

From 1981 to 2021, land surface temperatures across India exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern (Fig.1). Temperatures typically rose from April to July, peaking in May. The summer months recorded highs of 25 °C to 45 °C in northern India and 30 °C to 40 °C in the south. A cooling effect was observed during the monsoon season (June to September), with temperatures moderating to between 25 °C and 35 °C across most regions. Post-monsoon, temperatures declined steadily, reaching their lowest in December, particularly in the northern states. Notably, southern and western regions, including Maharashtra and Karnataka, experienced relatively higher temperatures even during January, while the north remained significantly cooler in winter. The time series analysis of land surface temperature trends (Fig.2) reveals both seasonal fluctuations and a long-term upward trend. Sharp increases were observed in specific years such as 1987 and 2009. Additionally, the irregular component of the decomposition highlights substantial year-to-year variability, indicating growing temperature uncertainty and deviations from expected seasonal norms during the study period.

The seasonality plot (Fig.3)clearly demonstrates that land surface temperatures across India followed a predictable annual cycle, with the highest temperatures occurring during May and June. This peak corresponds to the pre-monsoon period, when extreme heat was most common. In contrast, the lowest temperatures were observed during December and January, aligning with the winter season. Notably, Fig.3also highlights a rising temperature baseline over time, with seasonal peaks becoming increasingly higher in recent years. This indicates that climate warming was not confined to a specific season but is occurring year-round. The most substantial increases were evident during the summer months, suggesting an intensification of heat extremes.

The seasonality plot represents the seasonality pattern in air temperature (°C) across India from 1981 to 2021.

The annual trend analysis of average air temperature (Fig.4) indicates a consistent increase over the 41-year period from 1981 to 2021. The trajectory of the trend line reveals that the average air temperature had been steadily rising, with an estimated increase of 0.0086 units for each passing year. This finding aligns with global trends of rising temperatures due to climate change, driven by factors such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and urbanization. The observed trend underscores the need for targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies to address the impacts of rising temperatures on India’s ecosystems, agriculture, and human health.

Precipitation patterns across India from 1981 to 2021 showed considerable variability (Fig.5). January to March saw minimal precipitation, particularly in western regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat. The monsoon season (June–September) brought heavy rainfall, especially in the Malabar coastal region and the northeastern states. Southern states such as Kerala and northeastern areas like Shillong began receiving higher precipitation from April, while Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra experienced the least rainfall during the pre-monsoon months. The overall trend indicated an increase in precipitation over time, particularly after 2010, with an anticipated rise of 0.387 mm per year.

The time series decomposition of monthly precipitation from 1981 to 2021 reveals distinct seasonal, trend, and irregular components (Fig.6). The observed time series exhibits a strong seasonal pattern, with pronounced peaks corresponding to monsoon seasons and troughs indicating drier months. The estimated trend component demonstrates multi-decadal variability rather than a consistent increase or decrease, with periods of rising and falling precipitation levels observed over the four decades. The irregular component captures residual variations after removing the seasonal and trend effects, highlighting occasional extreme anomalies, likely associated with unusual weather events such as droughts or extreme rainfall. These findings underscore the dominant influence of monsoon driven seasonality in India’s precipitation patterns, while also reflecting long-term climatic variability and irregular fluctuations.

The seasonality plot (Fig.7) represents the seasonal pattern of precipitation across India from 1981 to 2021. The x-axis represents the months of the year, while the y-axis represents the monthly precipitation. The plot reveals a prominent peak in precipitation during the monsoon season, typically from July to August. This peak corresponds to the period when India receives the majority of its annual rainfall, which is crucial for agriculture, water supply, and hydropower generation. Conversely, a dip in monthly precipitation is observed during the winter months, particularly from December to March, representing the cooler and drier period of the year. The plot also indicates an increase in monthly precipitation levels in more recent years, with notable peaks in July and September. This trend suggests that the monsoon season is becoming more intense, with higher rainfall levels, which could increase the risk of flooding in vulnerable regions.

The annual trend plot of average monthly precipitation (Fig.8) illustrates a steady increase in precipitation across India over the 41-year period. The trajectory of the trend line indicates that the average precipitation has been increasing steadily, with an anticipated rise of 0.387 mm per year. This finding suggests that India is experiencing a gradual intensification of the monsoon season, with higher rainfall levels and increased variability in precipitation patterns. This trend could have significant implications for water management, agriculture, and disaster preparedness, particularly in regions prone to flooding and landslides.

Figure9presents a comparison between high-resolution (HR) and coarse-resolution (CRU) Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data for the year 2001. The comparison reveals similar drought patterns across different time scales (1 month, 3 months, and 6 months), though the HR data provides finer detail. In January 2001, drought events were concentrated in southern India, particularly in regions like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where the SPEI value was less than -1.5, indicating severe drought conditions. A similar pattern was observed in the HR estimates, which captured a higher magnitude of drought events compared to the CRU estimates. In March 2001, drought events were primarily observed in eastern India, including West Bengal and Odisha. The HR data revealed a more detailed spatial distribution of drought events, highlighting the severity of the situation in specific regions. In June 2001, the highest drought events were observed, with central and northern parts of India, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, experiencing severe drought conditions. The HR estimates provided a more accurate representation of the drought intensity and its spatial distribution compared to the CRU estimates.

Figure10presents the inter-comparison between SPEI-HR and SPEI-CRU for the year 2020. The analysis reveals that drought events in 2020 were observed in northern, northeastern, and eastern regions of India, with a notable spread towards the southern and western parts. The HR estimates indicated a more significant proportion of drought areas, particularly in Maharashtra and Karnataka, compared to the CRU estimates. The HR data also revealed that the severity of drought events in 2020 was higher than in 2001, with a larger area affected by severe drought conditions. The comparison highlights the importance of using high-resolution data for more accurate monitoring and assessment of drought events, particularly in regions prone to water scarcity and agricultural losses.

The spatiotemporal correlation analysis between the high-resolution SPEI (SPEI-HR) and the coarse-resolution CRU-SPEI for the period 1981–2020 confirmed the robustness of the SPEI-HR dataset (Fig.11). Across all three time scales (1-, 3-, and 6-month), most regions exhibited statistically significant correlations (p <0.05), with R values exceeding 0.7 in large parts of central and western India, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. These strong correlations validate the temporal consistency of the SPEI-HR with the established CRU product. However, relatively lower correlations were observed in small portions of the northeastern states and Jammu & Kashmir. Overall, the results affirm the reliability of the high-resolution SPEI for regional-scale drought assessment across diverse climatic zones in India.

The SPEI 1 trend analysis (Fig.12) revealed increasing drought events over the past two decades, with significant droughts occurring in 1999, 2002, 2004, 2007, and 2009. The SPEI-3 data showed intensified seasonal drought conditions in 1987, 1992, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, 2017, and 2021. The SPEI-6 analysis indicated a pattern similar to that of SPEI-3, with rising levels of precipitation variability and temperature fluctuations across India, and an increasing frequency of extreme drought events. This increasing trend in drought severity and frequency is a clear indication of the impacts of climate change on India’s hydrological cycle. The temporal distribution of SPEI underscores the need for adaptive water management practices to mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged droughts on agriculture and water resources.

The Mann–Kendall test (Fig.13) revealed statistically significant negative trends in SPEI across extensive regions of India during the period 1981–2021, indicating an overall intensification of drought conditions. At the 1-month time scale (SPEI-1), short-term water deficits increased notably in central and northwestern India. At the 3-month scale, a rise in seasonal drought frequency was observed, particularly affecting major rainfed regions such as eastern Maharashtra, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh. At the 6-month scale, prolonged drought events became more prevalent across western Rajasthan, southern Andhra Pradesh, and several areas of central and eastern India. These spatial and temporal patterns underscore a growing incidence of drought events in India.

This study provides critical insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of air temperature and precipitation across India from 1981 to 2021, with a focus on drought conditions. The major findings indicate a significant increase in land surface temperatures and a general rise in precipitation levels, particularly during the monsoon season. However, the data also reveal an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of droughts, especially in regions like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and northeastern and upper Gangetic plain India. The novelty of this study lies in its use of high-resolution (HR) data, which offers a more detailed understanding of these climatic changes compared to traditional coarse-resolution datasets. This study is particularly valuable for achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13, which focuses on climate action. By providing a nuanced understanding of regional climate trends, the findings can inform the development of targeted adaptation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, especially in vulnerable regions.

The analysis of spatiotemporal trends in land surface temperatures across India from 1981 to 2021 reveals a consistent and significant increase in temperatures, with the most pronounced warming observed during the summer months. This rise in temperature is particularly evident in northern India, where summer temperatures can reach up to 45 °C. The warming trend is likely driven by global climate change factors such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and urbanization46–49. The urban heat island effect further exacerbates this warming, particularly in densely populated regions50,51. Additionally, the warming of the Indian Ocean has been linked to shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, which contribute to the observed rise in temperatures14.

Similarly, the analysis of precipitation patterns over the same period reveals a general increase in rainfall, particularly during the monsoon season. The seasonality plot shows that the monsoon rains, which typically peak between July and August, have become more intense in recent years. This intensification of the monsoon could be attributed to the warming of the Indian Ocean, which increases the moisture content in the atmosphere, leading to heavier rainfall (Gadgil et al., 2018). However, this increased intensity of monsoon rains has not been evenly distributed across the country, leading to a paradox where some regions experience severe flooding while others face droughts. The variability in precipitation patterns, with some areas like the Malabar coast and northeastern states receiving more rainfall and others like Rajasthan and Gujarat experiencing minimal precipitation, reflects the complex interplay between regional climate systems and global warming (Mishra & Singh, 2010). The findings are consistent with other studies that link global warming to more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns, which can have far-reaching impacts on agriculture, water resources, and disaster preparedness52.

The analysis of drought patterns using the SPEI highlighted significant regional variations in drought frequency and severity. The HR data showed a more detailed and severe pattern of drought events compared to the CRU data, especially in southern and central India. The analysis of the SPEI values indicates that the western and central regions of India, particularly Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and parts of Madhya Pradesh, were most severely affected by drought conditions. Drought was especially prominent in these areas during the pre-monsoon months of January to April and re-emerged in the post-monsoon period from September to December. India is particularly concerning, as these areas are heavily dependent on monsoon rains for agriculture and water supply (Mishra & Singh, 2010). The drought-prone areas identified in this study, particularly in western and central India can be attributed to several interrelated factors. One significant factor is the variability and decline in monsoon rainfall, which has been observed in these regions over the past few decades. According to53, regions like Gujarat and Rajasthan have experienced a significant reduction in monsoon rainfall, which is likely due to changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns influenced by global climate change3. Studies have shown that the frequency and intensity of such dry spells have increased, particularly in western and central India, leading to more severe meteorological droughts54,55. Deforestation in central India, for example, has led to changes in local rainfall patterns and reduced evapotranspiration, further intensifying drought conditions56. The reduction in forest cover affects the local water cycle, decreasing moisture availability and contributing to prolonged periods of dryness57,58. However, the correlation analysis between SPEI-HR and SPEI-CRU confirmed the reliability of HR data in capturing nuanced drought patterns, showing that drought conditions have become more severe and widespread over the past two decades.

The Mann–Kendall test further supports these findings, showing a significant increase in drought events in northern India, with regions like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh exhibiting decreasing SPEI values, indicating more frequent droughts. Notably, the frequency of drought events has also increased in the Northeastern region, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and parts of Southern India over the last two decades. This trend suggests that these areas are experiencing more frequent and severe droughts, driven by a combination of reduced monsoon reliability and increased temperatures, which elevate evapotranspiration rates3,14. The weakening monsoon circulation, influenced by large-scale atmospheric changes, has disproportionately affected these regions, leading to prolonged dry spells. Additionally, land use changes such as deforestation and agricultural expansion have exacerbated drought conditions by altering local climate dynamics and reducing water availability56,59. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted drought mitigation strategies, including improved water management and the promotion of sustainable land use practices, to address the increasing frequency and severity of droughts in these vulnerable regions.

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of air temperature and precipitation across India from 1981 to 2021, with a particular focus on drought conditions. The results reveal a consistent and significant increase in both temperature and precipitation, especially during the monsoon season. However, this increase is accompanied by heightened variability, leading to more frequent and severe droughts, particularly in regions such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Southern India. The increasing drought frequency in these regions is likely driven by a combination of reduced monsoon reliability, rising temperatures, and land use changes.

The findings underscore the complex interplay between global climate change and regional climatic systems, resulting in significant impacts on India’s water resources, agriculture, and overall environmental stability. The use of high-resolution data in this study has allowed for a more nuanced understanding of these trends, highlighting the importance of detailed spatial analysis in climate studies.

Given the increasing frequency and severity of droughts, there is an urgent need for targeted adaptation and mitigation strategies. These should include enhanced water management practices, reforestation efforts, and the promotion of sustainable land use practices. Policymakers must consider these findings in their efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change, particularly in vulnerable regions. By doing so, India can better safeguard its ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and water resources, thereby contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13, which focuses on climate action.
