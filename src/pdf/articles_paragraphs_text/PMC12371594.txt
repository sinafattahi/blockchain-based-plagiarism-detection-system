Temperature is a critical parameter that can significantly
influence
the outcome of the redox reactions. However, determining the temperature-dependent
properties of redox couples is often time-consuming and susceptible
to inconsistencies. In this work, we present a temperature-controlled
electrochemical station capable of acquiring electrochemical measurements
under preprogrammed conditions to extract key thermodynamic parameters.
We demonstrate the functionality of this system using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy to determine the activation energies of the
[Fe­(CN)6]3–/4–redox
couple and the hydrogen evolution reaction on platinum and gold electrodes.
Additionally, we illustrate automated cyclic voltammetry data acquisition
for [Fe­(CN)6]3–/4–,
[Ru­(NH3)6]2+/3+, benzoquinone,
and anthraquinone. By analyzing the temperature-dependent shifts inE1/2, we calculated the entropy changes and thermogalvanic
coefficients of these systems. Furthermore, we examined the entropy
variations of ferricyanide in mixed aqueous–organic electrolytes,
highlighting the role of solvation reconfiguration. The versatility
of this setup offers a robust and efficient platform for the rapid
characterization of temperature-dependent redox properties, with implications
for energy conversion and sensing applications.

As electrochemical reactions play an increasingly
important role
in advancing renewable energy technologies, significant research efforts
have focused on the development of new catalysts and systems to enhance
reaction yields. However, several other factors also critically influence
the performance of these reactions, one of which is the temperature.
All electrochemical reactions are inherently sensitive to temperature
changes, which affect both the enthalpy and the entropy of the reaction.
Additionally, the temperature influences the vibrational energy and
solvation barriers of reaction intermediates, thereby altering the
activation energy. In essence, both the thermodynamics and kinetics
of redox reactions are governed by the temperature. A deeper understanding
of the temperature dependence of redox reactions could yield valuable
insights for improving electrochemical processes.

A wide range
of thermodynamic parameters exhibit temperature dependence,
many of which are well described in standard textbooks. Among them,
the Arrhenius law is a fundamental principle for describing the temperature
dependence of reaction kinetics, from which the activation energy
(Ea), a key parameter for any chemical
reaction, can be derived. Other important temperature-dependent factors
include ion mobility, surface adsorption processes, and double-layer
structure. Even the electrode potential itself is influenced by temperature,
as described by the Nernst equation. The change in electrode potential
with respect to temperature, known as the thermogalvanic temperature
coefficient (α = ΔE/ΔT), has recently attracted considerable attention in the research
community due to its relevance as a figure of merit in the design
of waste heat recovery systems.−Given the broad range of fundamental
parameters in electrochemical reactions that are temperature-dependent,
it is essential to develop tools that can accurately and reproducibly
measure these properties.

The experimental approach to investigating
the temperature dependence
of electrochemical reactions, such as measuringEaor α, would be to manually measure redox properties
at a specific temperature one at a time. However, this method is often
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to human errors,
rendering manual temperature control suboptimal. Recent literature
has increasingly emphasized automation in electrochemical processes,
offering new insights into redox mechanisms. For example, Baker et
al. reported an electrochemical setup operating in a 96-well plate
format, enabling the parallel acquisition of substantial data in a
single run. Similarly, Rodríguez-López
et al. recently introduced automated pH measurement tools for electrochemical
applications.,These high-throughput strategies,
whether applied in series or in parallel, provide standardized workflows
that ensure data reproducibility while saving time. Beyond electrochemistry,
automation has become a critical tool in chemical laboratories for
developing new materials and performing physical characterizations.−These advances serve as the inspiration for this work, which aims
to automate temperature control to investigate thermodynamic parameters
of redox reactions more precisely.

In this study, we designed
and implemented an automated electrochemical
setup with a precise temperature control. Given the sensitivity of
thermodynamic parameters to temperature fluctuations, maintaining
fine control over the temperature profile of electrochemical reactions
enables the extraction of valuable mechanistic information. Using
temperature-dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we determined
the activation energy for the ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple and
the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using different electrodes.
Furthermore, we calculated the reaction entropy and thermogalvanic
coefficients (α) for the [Fe­(CN)6]3–/4–, [Ru­(NH3)6]2+/3+, benzoquinone, and anthraquinone redox couples. Detailed
instructions for reproducing our setup are provided throughout the
paper and in theSupporting Information. We believe that this system will benefit the broader electrochemical
community by enabling accurate investigation of temperature-dependent
redox processes and encouraging the integration of automation into
renewable energy research.

The overall system design is illustrated
inFiguresandS1. The electrochemical cell comprises a water-jacketed
100 mL beaker with a larger water container (ca. 5 L) serving as the
temperature reservoir. A water heater regulates the reservoir temperature,
and temperature probes are placed in both the water reservoir and
the electrochemical cell to monitor the thermal conditions. The water
heater is controlled via a solid-state relay switch, which toggled
on or off in response to signals from the temperature probes. Electrochemical
measurements were conducted by using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT204 potentiostat.
To enable communication between the potentiostat and external devices,
we employed the Autolab software development kit provided by the manufacturer,
which allows the external hardware to initiate and control the potentiostat.

Illustration
of the automated temperature electrochemical setup.
Electrochemical experiments are conducted in a temperature-controlled
three-electrode configuration. Water heater, temperature sensor, and
potentiostat are all connected to a data acquisition module and controlled
via LabVIEW software. Photograph images of the actual setup are available
inFigure S1.

LabVIEW software was used to coordinate the water
heater, temperature
sensors, and potentiostat, enabling full automation of the temperature
control across various electroanalytical techniques. A comprehensive
list of hardware components and detailed assembly instructions are
provided in theSupporting Information.

In a typical temperature-dependent experiment, the water reservoir
is initially set to approximately 0 °C using an ice–water
bath. LabVIEW is programmed to initiate electrochemical measurements
starting at a predefined temperature, typically 5 °C in this
study. The temperature is then incrementally increased by 1 °C,
and at each step, a predefined electroanalytical technique (e.g.,
cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
and so forth) is executed. The experimental parameters for each technique
are stored in the native Autolab file format and accessed by the LabVIEW
program. As a result, most standard electroanalytical techniques are
compatible with this setup. After measurements at each temperature
are completed, the system automatically proceeds to the next temperature
setting, continuing this sequence until all experiments are finalized.
The resulting data are automatically exported as.csv files and batch-processed
by using custom Mathematica scripts for analysis. Error bars reported
in this study are standard deviations based on triplicate repeats
of each experiment.

EIS data for the [Fe­(CN)6]3–/4–redox couple (Figure) were collected
at the half-wave potential (E1/2) using
an AC amplitude of 20 mV, over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10
Hz. The measurements were performed in a 50 mM [Fe­(CN)6]3–solution, with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7)
as the supporting electrolyte. For the hydrogen evolution reaction,
EIS experiments were conducted over the same frequency range with
a DC bias of −0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl for the Pt electrode and −0.4
V vs Ag/AgCl for Au electrodes. The bias voltages were selected to
be near the HER onset potentials for each electrode material, which
differ between those of Pt and Au. All HER experiments were performed
in 1 M H2SO4solution.

Cyclic voltammetry data were collected at a scan
rate of 50 mV/s
in 1 M pH 7 phosphate buffer, unless otherwise specified. The thermogalvanic
coefficient was extracted from the slope of theE1/2vs temperature graph,α=ΔEΔT. All electrochemical experiments were carried
out under nitrogen-purged conditions to eliminate the influence of
dissolved oxygen.

As described
by the Nernst equation, the temperature directly influences the formal
potential of any redox couple. Therefore, it is essential to account
for the temperature-induced shift in the Ag/AgCl reference electrode,
which was used throughout the experiments. To quantify this temperature
drift, we placed two identical Ag/AgCl reference electrodes in solutions
at different temperatures, one in a heated solution and the other
in room temperature, and measured the resulting potential difference
(ΔV) as a function of the temperature difference.
The data are presented inFigure S2. The
measured drift for the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was ca. −0.5
mV/°C, which is close to the values reported in the literature. It is worth noting that this drift may vary
depending on a number of physical parameters of the experiment, such
as redox couple solubility, liquid junction potential, solvent thermal
expansion, electrolyte composition, and so forth. As such, periodic
temperature calibration of the reference electrode is recommended
to ensure accurate measurements. For all subsequent voltage data presented
in this study, we corrected the measured potentials to account for
the temperature-dependent drift of the reference electrode.

Thermodiffusion effects, unequal ion concentration at hot vs cold
electrode, could also impact the voltage measurement of an electrochemical
device. However, in a low-viscosity solvent, such as water, the contribution
of thermodiffusion is in the order of 10s μV/°C, much smaller
than the thermogalvanic effect.,Thus, the thermodiffusion
effect is not considered in our experimental measurements.

As
an initial demonstration, we investigated the EIS of the ferri-ferrocyanide
redox couple. In this experiment, the automated electrochemical station
was programmed to collect EIS spectra over a temperature range from
5 to 60 °C, with measurements taken at 1 °C increments.
The results are presented inFigure. First, we observed that the solution resistance,
represented by the x-intercept on the real axis at high frequency,
decreased with increasing temperature. This trend is consistent with
the expected exponential relationship between the ionic mobility and
temperature, as further illustrated inFigure S3.

The semicircular feature in the EIS spectra, commonly
associated
with the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the redox reaction, is inversely proportional to the exchange
current density (i0), as described ineq. Since the exchange current
density is proportional to the rate constant, it exhibits an Arrhenius-type
temperature dependence, as described byeq. From the EIS data shown inFigurea,Rctvalues were extracted to calculatei0and, subsequently, determine the activation energy (Ea) of the ferri-ferrocyanide redox couple. The fittedRctvalues are provided inTable S1.Figureb displays the plot of ln­(i0)
vs 1/T. The activation energy, determined from the
slope of the linear fit by using the Arrhenius equation, was found
to be ca. 3.35 ± 0.51 kJ/mol. The linearity of the fitted plot
highlights the capability of our setup to provide a rapid and reliable
method for determining the activation energy of any redox systems.

It is important to
note that the activation energy of redox reactions
is potential-dependent, due to several factors, including the influence
of overpotential on the Fermi levels of the oxidized and reduced species,
variations in surface coverage of electroactive species at different
applied potentials, and changes in the configuration of active sites
on the electrode surface.−InFigurea, the EIS data were recorded atE1/2; thus, the reported activation energy corresponds to the equilibrium
electron transfer process of the [Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–redox couple. If desired,
the temperature-controlled setup described here offers a fast and
efficient platform to determineEaat
different potentials simply by modifying the DC bias in the EIS protocol.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the extraction of theEafor the HER is a key electrocatalytic process.
Pt, a well-established catalyst for the HER, exhibits a small semicircular
arc in the EIS spectra, indicative of a lowRct. In contrast, when an Au electrode was used, a significantly
largerRctwas observed (Figure S4). The fittedRctvalues
for Pt and Au electrodes are provided inTables S2 and S3. These findings are consistent with the expectation
that different materials possess distinct catalytic properties (i.e.,
differentEa). The extracted activation
energies for the HER on Pt and Au electrodes were found to be 18.9
± 4.1 and 52.9 ± 4.2 kJ/mol, respectively. This demonstrates
that our setup is well-suited for screening the activation energies
of a wide range of catalytic reactions, providing fast and accurate
temperature-dependent data.

The thermogalvanic
temperature coefficient is a critical parameter that determines the
operational efficiency of thermogalvanic cells. It is typically measured
as the open-circuit voltage (Voc) between
a hot and a cold electrode connected via an electrolyte. However,
this traditional approach requires two separate temperature control
and measurement systems, making the experimental setup complex and
time-consuming.−An alternative method involves determining α
using cyclic voltammetry under temperature-controlled conditions.
However, the reproducibility of such measurements can be affected
by numerous factors, including subtle variations in the electrode
placement within the electrolyte. Moreover, in both methods, only
a limited number of temperature data points are usually collected
due to the labor-intensive nature of performing experiments at multiple
discrete temperatures.

Our automated temperature control system
provides a significant advantage by enabling continuous temperature
sweeps within a single experimental run, typically completed in under
2 h. As shown inFigure, we demonstrate the extraction of α from CV measurements for
[Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–, hydrobenzoquinone, [Ru­(NH3)6]2+/3+, and anthraquinone redox couples. The
resulting cyclic voltammograms exhibit excellent consistency across
the temperature range. Each experiment requires ca. 1 to 2 h only,
depending on the scan parameters, and operates entirely without human
intervention.

Cyclic voltammograms of (a) [Fe­(CN)6]3–/4–, (b) hydrobenzoquinone,
(c) [Ru­(NH3)6]2+/3+and (d) anthraquinone.
(a–c)
were conducted in 1 M pH 7 phosphate buffer, while (d) was conducted
in 0.5 M TBAPF6in DMF. Temperature was varied from 5 to
60 °C in all the experiments.

To determine α, theE1/2values
from each cyclic voltammogram were extracted using a Mathematica code
and plotted against temperature, as shown inFigure. The α value for the [Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–redox
couple was found to be–1.5 ± 0.12 mV/°C, which is
in very good agreement with reported literature values of −1.4
mV/°C.,,The temperature coefficients for hydrobenzoquinone and ruthenium
hexamine were determined to be −0.59 and 0.65 mV/°C, respectively.
In the case of anthraquinone in a nonaqueous solvent, two distinct
redox peaks were observed, corresponding to two sequential reduction
processes. The extracted α values were–0.05 and–0.9
mV/°C for the first and second reduction waves, respectively.
The temperature coefficient is directly related to the entropy change
of the redox reaction, according to the relationshipα=ΔEΔT=ΔSnF. The entropy change may arise from intrinsic
changes in the redox species or from modifications to their solvation
environments. Under N2-purged, nonaqueous conditions, anthraquinone
is reduced to its dianionic form. In such systems, the entropy change
is predominantly influenced by the reorganization of the solvation
shell. The second reduction introduces a higher negative charge, which
necessitates a greater rearrangement of the solvation sphere, leading
to a larger entropy change. These results demonstrate the capability
of our automated temperature-control setup to accurately measure α,
even for complex, multielectron redox systems.

Linear fitted lines for
(a) [Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–, (b) hydrobenzoquinone,
(c) [Ru­(NH3)6]2+/3+, and (d) anthraquinone.
(a–c) were conducted in 1 M pH 7 phosphate buffer, while (d)
was conducted in 0.5 M TBAPF6in DMF.

In the pursuit of improving the efficiency of thermogalvanic
cells
for waste heat recovery, achieving a larger α is desirable as
it enhances the voltage output per unit of temperature difference.
One common strategy to tune α involves modifying the electrolyte
composition by introducing organic solvents, thereby influencing the
entropic change associated with the redox reaction.,−This effect is generally attributed to changes in
the solvation structures of solvent molecules surrounding the redox-active
ions. However, the thermosensitive solubility of various electrolyte
compositions can also influence α, as recently highlighted. Both increase and decrease in α for the
[Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–redox couple have been reported upon the addition
of organic electrolytes.,Therefore, the ability
to accurately and reproducibly determine α across diverse electrolyte
systems is crucial for the rational design of high-performance thermogalvanic
systems.

Here, we demonstrate the variation in the thermogalvanic
coefficient
for the [Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–redox couple in electrolytes with varying ratios
of water and acetonitrile. As shown inFigurea, the temperature coefficient becomes increasingly
positive with a higher acetonitrile content. A concentration of 50
mM [Fe­(CN)6]3–was selected to ensure
that the solubility limit of the redox couple was not exceeded during
the experiment. Previous studies have reported that the α value
for the [Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–system becomes more negative upon the addition
of organic solvents, which was attributed to the thermosensitivity
of solubility.,However, when the solubility
limit is not reached, the presence of organic solvents such as acetonitrile
disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network in water, thereby reducing the
entropy change of the redox reaction.,This effect
is illustrated inFigureb, and it results in a more positive α. Our automated
temperature control system offers a convenient and reliable method
to investigate such solvent effects on thermogalvanic behavior with
high precision.

A current limitation of our automated temperature
platform is its
inability to decrease temperature, as the system presently includes
only a heating element. Consequently, temperature profiling is restricted
to a unidirectional, increasing sequence. However, incorporating a
cooling system would be straightforward and would enable bidirectional
temperature cycling between high and low set points. Another limitation
is that the current water reservoir is not thermally insulated. At
elevated temperatures (e.g., above 70 °C), significant heat loss
to the environment occurs, which slows the heating process and limits
the upper range of achievable temperatures. Insulating the water reservoir
would improve thermal efficiency and extend the system’s operational
temperature range. Furthermore, integrating a liquid-handling pump
could facilitate automated electrolyte flushing and refilling, enabling
a fully autonomous operation. These enhancements are part of ongoing
efforts in our group to refine the platform for high-throughput, autonomous
electrochemical data collection across a range of temperatures, pH
values, and electrolyte compositions.

In conclusion, we present a programmable,
temperature-controlled
electrochemical station capable of measuring the thermodynamic parameters
of redox reactions with high precision. The system was validated using
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry with
a variety of redox-active compounds, including [Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–, hydrobenzoquinone,
ruthenium hexamine, and anthraquinone. Activation energies for the
[Fe­(CN)6]3–/[Fe­(CN)6]4–and the HER on Pt were determined to be 3.35 ±
0.51 and 18.9 ± 4.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Temperature coefficients
for each redox species were extracted from temperature-dependent cyclic
voltammograms, and the influence of the solvation environment on the
entropy change of redox reactions was also demonstrated. This setup
offers a robust and self-consistent platform for efficiently acquiring
electrochemical data. Moreover, its compatibility with machine learning
tools positions it for future integration into autonomous experimental
systems. We are currently expanding the setup’s functionalities,
such as integrating gas regulation and liquid handling to determine
adsorption energy and pressure-dependent kinetics in electrocatalysis
applications. We anticipate that this platform will facilitate fundamental
electrochemical studies, accelerate catalyst screening, and advance
electroanalytical testing for a range of practical applications.
