Three-Dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing (Linke, Additive manufacturing, explained, 2017), has rapidly emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare simulation. This scoping review investigates simulation educators' knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) about the impact of 3D printing and explores 3D printing’s broader applications in healthcare simulation. By synthesizing existing literature, this study aims to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities for integrating 3D printing into simulation-based education.

The review followed the PRISMA-ScR framework, employing a six-step approach. A comprehensive search was conducted across databases, including PubMed, Medline, ERIC, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, covering studies published between 2000 and 2023. Keywords related to 3D printing and simulation-based education were used. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed articles discussing 3D printing's role in KSAs for simulation educators and its applications in healthcare simulation. Articles were charted and analyzed thematically to identify trends, challenges, and outcomes. A total of 181 studies were included, spanning 36 countries and 113 journals. Most studies focused on medical education, with 73% utilizing 3D-printed models for direct teaching. Key themes identified included realism, skill development, cost-effectiveness, and teaching effectiveness. Challenges included model accuracy, training gaps for educators, and resource limitations. Study designs were predominantly descriptive, with a significant portion being single-site case reports.

3D printing has the potential to revolutionize simulation-based education by enhancing realism, accessibility, and skill development. However, gaps in educator training and methodological rigor must be addressed. Future research should focus on multi-institutional studies and long-term outcomes to maximize the impact of the technology.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing has become a transformative manufacturing approach, enabling the creation of precise, integrated, and complex structures through accessible rapid prototyping [1–7]. Prioritizing design flexibility and accuracy, it supports applications such as affordable, custom manikin components and non-commercial trainers [3]. Technological advances in 3D printing have enhanced printing precision, expanded the material range, and refined the methods [8], driving its adoption in healthcare education. Key advantages include ease of use, structural control, design versatility, and cost-efficiency [6,9–12].

Simulation educators have access to several technologies, including sophisticated and life-like task trainers and manikins, as well as multiple realities such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, holography, distance, and virtual simulation technologies. At the same time, there is a dearth of educational resources available for 3D printing. The purpose of this project is to address an unmet need for a learning resource that enables simulation educators to leverage 3D printing, which can be challenging for them to find time and extract information and resources when integrating this modality into their simulation practices. This scoping review extracted the available information regarding 3D printing and outlined the available opportunities, explaining why 3D technology is valuable to understand and teach.

This scoping review examines the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that simulation educators may need to effectively promote the use and advantages of 3D printing in SBE. A scoping review is designed to map relevant studies focused on a particular area of interest and less focused on addressing specific research questions or assessing the quality of included studies [13]. Given that the body of evidence concerning the use of 3D printing in simulation-based education by simulation educators is still relatively limited, we opted for a scoping review methodology rather than a systematic review. This approach enabled us to thoroughly explore why simulation educators should be interested in 3D printing if given the opportunity.

IRB approval was sought and this study was found to be exempt.

We followed the scoping review framework, the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews, and the Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist [13,14].

We searched PubMed, Medline, ERIC, CINAHL, and Google Scholar (2000-to 2023, in-process, and other non-indexed citations) to identify articles addressing the KSAs of simulation educators on the use of 3D printers in simulation education. Search strategies were developed by an academic health science librarian (LN) with input from the project leads (LJR) and co-leads (JF and MB). The keywords used for the search were (“3D printing” OR “additive manufacturing” OR 3DP OR “3d-prin*” OR “3d prin*” OR “three-dimensional prin*” OR “three-dimensional prin*”) AND Simulat* AND (Healthcare or “health care” or medic* or nurs* or “Healthcare profession*” OR Physician* or “Allied Health”) AND (Educat* OR teach* OR train* OR session OR learn*) AND (“Simulation-based educat*” OR “SBE educator” OR “Simulation educator” OR “Simulation-Based education educator” OR “SBE-educator”).

Literature search was completed in April 2023 and limited to articles published between January 1, 2000, till April 18, 2023. The reason for selecting the year 2000 was the scarcity of relevant articles on KSA’s of simulation educators on using 3D printers in simulation education existing before 2000. Furthermore, the literature after 2000 was more up-to-date on this topic. English-language limits were applied to all databases. Foreign language material was excluded because of the cost and time needed for the translation of the studies. The PubMed, ERIC, Medline, and CINHAL databases yielded a total of 538 abstracts with nine total duplicates. We found 268 abstracts in the PubMed database.

This data corpus was imported to Covidence (Covidence systematic review software, 2023) for screening. These abstracts yielded zero results for the first research question. In order to answer the second research question, the keywords (“Simulation-based educat*” OR “SBE educator” OR “Simulation educator” OR “Simulation-Based education educator” OR “SBE-educator”) were taken out. This second search resulted in a second data corpus with 244 titles and abstract results. Of these, 181 met eligibility requirements.

Full-text peer-reviewed articles from PubMed, Eric, and CINAHL from 2000 to 2023 were included. The research articles written in English were included if they (1) discussed simulation educator KSAs and (2) 3D printing. Articles were excluded if they discussed clinical uses of 3DP with no educational component.

At first, only titles and abstracts were reviewed. The articles resulting from the second search of the databases were independently screened by LJR and JF using Covidence (Covidence systematic review software, 2023). Covidence is a web-based collaboration software platform that streamlines the production of systematic and other literature reviews. Abstract and title interrater reliability for screening was achieved by reviewing ten articles together by all authors. A common consensus was required between LJR and JF. If there was a disagreement, it was resolved by another author, MB. Included articles were moved to the next phase of full-text review. The interrater reliability was 0.57.

Selected studies were included for full-text review. Full-text interrater reliability was achieved by independently reviewing five articles by all team members and comparing results afterward. The full text of all included articles was reviewed by LJR and MB within Covidence, and the disagreement was resolved by the third author, JB. All three investigators (LJR, MB, and JF) discussed any discrepancies related to inclusion and exclusion. The interrater reliability was 0.6 (Fig.1).

LJR and MB created a data extraction framework and revised it in light of research questions and available literature. We (LJR and MB) extracted data for three articles, and modified the framework from lessons learned from the extraction so the data extracted would answer the research questions (RQs). We chose to collect data relevant to RQs including author, year of publication, place of study, aim/purpose, methods, participants, intervention, outcome, and key findings. All authors extracted data together for the first five studies to establish the interrater reliability. Later on, LJR and MB extracted the data according to the pre-determined framework within Covidence (Covidence systematic review software, 2023).

In this scoping review, 36 countries published 3D printing research in healthcare. The top four publishing countries were the United States of America, 46 (25%), Canada, 35 (19%), China, 25 (14%), and Korea, 9 (5%) (Fig.2).

The first six years of the review, 2010 to 2016, had less than ten studies per year. The following three years, 2017–2019, had almost twenty studies per year. The year 2020 had the most studies, with thirty-six, followed by a slight drop off from 2021 to 2023 (Fig.3).

In this scoping review, 77 (43%), reported being funded, 55 (30%), made no mention of funding, and 47 (26%), reported not being funded (Table1).

In this scoping review, published 3D printing research in healthcare was carried out at the following: Not described, 79 (44%), School/College/Academia, 47 (26%), Hospital, 43 (24%), Conference 5 (3%), Workshop 4 (2%), Simulation Center 1 (1%), and Remote 1 (1%). (Table2).

In this scoping review of published 3D printing research in healthcare the vast majority of types of studies were case reports, 146 (81%), followed by randomized control studies, 15 (8%), non-randomized experimental studies, 7(4%), economic evaluations, 5(3%), cohort studies, 4(2%), cross-sectional studies, 1(1%), diagnostic test accuracy studies, 1(1%), parallel mixed method design studies, 1(1%), randomized controlled trials, 1(1%). (Table3).

The number of participants varied from two to 258, with 61 (34%) not reporting. The average number of participants was 25, with the median being 17.

The level of the learners ranged from (1) not reported, 59 (33%), (2) intraprofessional/ interprofessional, 51 (28%), (3) residents, 25 (14%), (4) undergraduate students, 18 (10%), (5) attendings/practicing providers, 17 (9%), (6) patients, 7 (4%), (7) fellows, 2 (1%), (8) educators and simulation educators, 2 (1%) (Table4).

There were students/ participants from medicine, 167 (92%), basic medical sciences, 8(4%), and dental, 7(4%). (Table5).

In this scoping review, published 3D printing research in healthcare, 133 (73%) studies mentioned the 3D printed models being used directly for teaching and learning healthcare professionals. In comparison, the other 47 (26%) studies described the development of 3D printing models and feedback from the health care professionals on the 3D printed models. (Table6).

To better understand the relevance of the outcomes of the individual studies included in the scoping review, we used the thematic analysis approach. The thematic analysis has six phases as developed and described by Braun and Clarke [15]. We familiarized ourselves with the data, generated initial codes, searched for themes, and then reviewed them. We then defined and named the themes. We then produced the report. (Tables7and8).

We could not do a thematic analysis for the facilitating factors as only Mogali et al. [16] reported the factors that facilitated their intervention in any way. They reported the color-coding of the models positively impacted the learners by distinguishing the different parts of the anatomy such as yellow nerves, pink arteries, red muscles, and yellow bones [16].

Most studies reported the challenges of using 3D printing in SBL for which we conducted the thematic analysis. (Table9).

This scoping review highlighted the current breadth of existing literature on 3D printing applications in simulation-based education and uncovered critical trends, opportunities, and challenges. The analysis offers insights into the training of simulation educators, applications in healthcare education, educational applications and innovations, demographic trends of publications, multifaceted value of 3D printing, and challenges in 3D printing adoption, facilitating factors, opportunities for future research, and implications for practice and policies.

An important gap identified in the literature is the lack of formal training for simulation educators in 3D printing. Unlike other emerging technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing has not yet been integrated into faculty development programs. This gap limits the technology's full potential and highlights the need for structured training initiatives. These programs should cover the technical aspects of 3D printing, such as the “how to” of model design and file preparation, as well as pedagogical strategies for integrating printed models into simulation curricula.

The scoping review categorized studies into two primary applications for healthcare simulation: direct teaching and learning and the development of 3D-printed models with healthcare professional feedback. Approximately 73% of studies focused on using 3D-printed models for teaching healthcare professionals, highlighting their potential in enhancing procedural training, anatomical education, and surgical simulation [17–19]. For instance, 3D printing has been instrumental in creating anatomically accurate models that facilitate hands-on learning and skill development for medical students, residents, and practicing clinicians [18,20,21]. Another 26% of studies described the iterative process of developing 3D printing models, emphasizing the importance of customization and model refinement to meet specific educational objectives [22]. One example is the manufacture of a prostate phantom to support training programs for ultrasound-based interstitial prostate brachytherapy [23].

The review identified several innovative uses of 3D printing in SBE. Beyond traditional applications, such as anatomical models for surgical training, studies explored its potential in creating patient-specific models to enhance patient education and shared decision-making. For instance, color-coded models that delineate nerves, arteries, and muscles provide learners with a clearer understanding of complex anatomical relationships. Such innovations not only improved educational outcomes but also foster interdisciplinary collaboration and communication.

Moreover, the ability to produce custom models tailored to individual learning objectives highlighted the flexibility and versatility of 3D printing. This personalization ensures that learners at different stages of training, from undergraduate students to seasoned professionals, receive the appropriate level of challenge and engagement.

The review revealed a growing global interest in 3D printing within healthcare simulation by a gradual increase in the number of studies over the years and the studies originating from more countries over time. (Fig.1). Research has been conducted across 36 countries, with significant contributions from the United States, Canada, China, and Korea [24]. These countries accounted for a substantial portion of the 113 journals publishing on this topic, such asCureus,Journal of Surgical Education, andWorld Neurosurgery. This upward trend is happening as more people are adopting the technology due to the awareness and lowering of costs. This will have a positive impact on healthcare learners by giving them better learning opportunities than would have been otherwise available.

Notably, the upward trajectory of publications from 2010 to 2020 reflects a surge in interest driven by technological advancements and increased accessibility. However, the slight decline in publications post-2020 likely corresponds to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have diverted resources and priorities [25]. This trend underscores the increasing penetration of 3D printing into healthcare education systems, which might be facilitated by reduced printer costs, improved accessibility, and the proliferation of open-source platforms for sharing 3D printing files [26,27].

We identified several themes surrounding 3D printing exhibiting its multifaceted value, which might play a role in answering our research question about KSAs for simulation educators. These facets included 1) realism and validity, 2) skill development and teaching effectiveness and 3) practicality, and affordability.

Realism emerged as a cornerstone of 3D printing's utility in simulation-based education. High-fidelity models replicate real-world conditions, providing learners with lifelike training experiences [28]. These models exhibit various forms of validity, including face, construct, and content validity, which ensure their credibility as effective teaching tools [20,29]. Studies demonstrated that realistic models enhanced learners' confidence and satisfaction, reinforcing their utility in clinical training [30].

The ability of 3D-printed models to improve surgical and procedural skills, particularly in high-stakes areas such as cardiology, neurosurgery, and dental surgery, was a recurring theme [31,32]. These models were also effective in teaching complex anatomical and radiological concepts [33,34]. Moreover, the practicality of 3D-printed models allowed educators to tailor teaching strategies to diverse learner needs, ensuring a more personalized and impactful learning experience.

One of the most compelling advantages of 3D printing is its cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods [35]. In a targeted literature search the use of 3D printed anatomical models in the operating room found a cost savings of $3720/case. In 3D printed surgical guides a savings of $1488/case was found. This cost saving was due to spending less time in the operation theater [36]. The ability to produce customized, reusable models at a fraction of the cost has democratized access to advanced simulation tools. This affordability has allowed simulation centers with limited resources to integrate 3D printing into their training programs, fostering innovation and accessibility [37].

Despite its benefits, 3D printing in simulation-based education faces several challenges. Realism, while a strength, is often limited by inaccuracies in model design or inadequate anatomical representation. Structural limitations, such as models that fail to support all procedural steps, remain a significant hurdle. Additionally, the small size and fragility of some models can hinder their functionality and durability.

Another challenge lies in training and usability. Many educators lack the necessary expertise in 3D printing, particularly in segmenting and preparing digital files for printing. This skills gap underscores the need for comprehensive faculty development programs to equip simulation educators with the knowledge and skills required to leverage this technology effectively in any center. Equipment-related issues, such as printer maintenance and scalability, further complicate widespread adoption.

The review also highlighted limitations in study design, with a predominance of case reports and single-site studies. These methodological weaknesses restrict the generalizability of findings and hinder the development of robust evidence to support the widespread adoption of 3D printing in healthcare simulation. Regarding the diffusion of innovation theory, 3D printing is moving out of the early adoption phase. The challenge now is to transition to the early majority and late majority phase.

Several facilitating factors were identified that could accelerate the adoption of 3D printing in simulation-based education. Collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and clinical stakeholders have been instrumental in refining model designs and addressing usability issues. For example, partnerships with experienced simulationists have led to innovations such as flexible skin sleeves and stabilized model stands, which enhance the functionality of 3D-printed models.

Open-source platforms and shared resources have also played a crucial role in democratizing access to 3D printing. By providing educators with ready-to-use digital files and templates, these platforms reduce the barriers to entry and promote experimentation and innovation.

The review highlights several areas for future research. Large-scale, multi-institutional studies are needed to validate the impact of 3D printing on educational and clinical outcomes. Longitudinal research could provide insights into the sustained benefits of 3D-printed models and their role in bridging the gap between education and practice.

Another promising area for exploration is the integration of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI-driven design can automate the segmentation process of 3D which can lower the cost [38]. New mixed materials in complex tissue engineering can enhance model realism and functionality [39]. These advancements could address current limitations and unlock new possibilities for simulation-based education.

The findings of this review have significant implications for practice and policy. The growing body of evidence underscores the need for simulation centers to integrate 3D printing into their training programs. Policymakers and institutional leaders should prioritize investments in 3D printing infrastructure and training to ensure its widespread adoption, due to the value in skill development and teaching effectiveness as well as practicality, affordability, and realism. Additionally, the inclusion of 3D printing modules in simulation curricula could prepare educators and learners to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.

There are several limitations. First, the study end date was 23 August 2023, and thus, later publications were not included. More recent studies might yield more significant results than earlier papers. Second, the majority of studies reviewed were single-site investigations or case reports, as expected of any new technology. Single case reports limit generalizability across diverse educational and healthcare settings. Recent studies might be more advanced and offer more broadly applicable results. Third, few studies focused on simulation educators’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes, leaving gaps in understanding how 3D printing can be effectively integrated into teaching practices. Recent studies may examine the knowledge, skills, and attitudes involved in simulation educators. Most studies employed descriptive designs, with limited randomized controlled trials or longitudinal research to establish causal relationships or long-term impacts. Variability in reporting quality and inconsistent use of standardized guidelines such as CONSORT or STROBE hindered effective data synthesis and comparison. Many studies emphasized model creation over practical application, leaving insufficient exploration of the effectiveness of 3D-printed models in real-world teaching scenarios.

This scoping review highlights the transformative potential of 3D printing in healthcare simulation. By enhancing realism, promoting skill development, and reducing costs, 3D printing has emerged as a powerful tool for simulation-based education. However, its adoption is not without challenges, including technical, training, and methodological barriers. Addressing these challenges through targeted research, collaborative initiatives, and faculty development programs may help advance the integration of 3D printing in healthcare education. As 3D printing technology advances, it may support the evolution of simulation-based education through expanded applications and instructional possibilities.
