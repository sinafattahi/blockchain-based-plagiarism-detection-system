To investigate the differential effects of three types of structured physical activity interventions (aerobic, coordination, and team sports) on executive functions in school-aged children, and to examine the age- and gender-specific responses to these interventions through a longitudinal study design. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 426 children (aged 7–12 years) assigned to four groups: aerobic exercise (n = 106), coordination exercise (n = 107), team sports (n = 106), and control (n = 107). The 36-week intervention program consisted of three 45-min sessions weekly. Executive functions were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and motor competence was evaluated through standardized assessments at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Executive functions were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), including measures of working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control; motor competence was evaluated through a comprehensive assessment using Movement ABC-2 (assessing fine motor control), Bruininks-Oseretsky Test-2 (assessing gross motor skills), and KTK test (assessing coordination abilities), constituting a comprehensive motor development index system. Coordination exercise demonstrated the largest effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.89) for executive function enhancement, followed by aerobic exercise (d = 0.76) and team sports (d = 0.72). Strong correlations were observed between motor competence improvements and executive function development (r = 0.58–0.72). Gender-specific analyses revealed superior improvements in coordination-based tasks for females and greater aerobic performance gains for males. Age-stratified analysis showed younger participants (7–9 years) achieved greater cognitive flexibility improvements, while older participants (10–12 years) demonstrated superior working memory enhancement. Executive functions in school children are considerably facilitated through structured physical activity-oriented interventions, in particular exercises targeting coordination. The relationship between cognitive development and motor competence appears to be gender- and age-dependent and thus calls for tailored intervention in educational settings.

Executive functions (EFs) are a set of higher-order processes capable of focusing attention, managing behaviour, and providing mental flexibility1. EFs are fundamentally important for performing academically, with a wealth of literature documenting their impact on achievement in elementary school education and correlating performance with EF abilities2. Beyond academic outcomes, however, EFs also have other roles and implications, particularly concerning mental health, where deficits in executive functioning are associated with various developmental and psychological disorders, as well as difficulties with self-regulation or behavioural control3,4. Inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility5are the three basic elements of the EF model. These components develop progressively through childhood, marked by motor and cognitive milestones occurring together6,7. Advances in neuroscience have recently underscored the estre relationship between the cerebellum and higher cognitive processes providing biological evidence for the link between motor and cognitive ability8,9. This aligns with Piagetian theory that highlights the importance of sensorimotor activity in the formation of cognitive functions10.

The development of executive functions (EFs) progresses in a sequential manner relative to the development of multiple motor skills as shown from correlational research with neuroimaging data which demonstrates overlap of the networks responsible for motor coordination and executive control11,12. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show that motor skills acquired during the early years are a strong predictor of cognitive skills later in life13,14. This association continues throughout life as other studies have shown links from the development of motor skills in infancy to cognitive skills in advanced old age15.

According to dynamic systems theory of motor development, both cognitive processes and motor functions are viewed as products of the individual, task, and the surrounding context16. This has been supported through reviews reporting strong relationships between motor skills and cognitive skills across various age groups17,18. The relationship is particularly important in economically disadvantaged nations where resources for cognitive training are scarce and where the relationship between physical activity and both motor and executive functions becomes more important19.

Lately, studies have begun to appreciate the intricate relationships that exist between particular components of motor skills and various components of executive functioning20,21. They suggest that the balance of interaction between motor and cognitive activities is impacted by the available working memory resources22and altered by some of the complexity of the motor tasks23.

Longitudinal research spanning several years has shown that early levels of motor skills have predictive validity for later developments in executive functioning24, suggesting a cascading influence on development where more proficient motor skills lead to improvements in higher-order cognitive processes25.

The pragmatic implications of such findings have implications in school settings because motor skill enhancement can serve as an initial indicator of readiness for school26and later school performance27.Fine motor skills, in particular, have shown strong associations with academic competencies28, and both fine and gross motor skills have been identified as predictors of psychosocial adaptation and academic achievement29. This relationship appears to be particularly robust in mathematics and reading performance30.

Current research gaps include the need for more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying the motor-cognitive relationship, particularly in different populations and developmental stages31,32. Additionally, while evidence supports the connection between motor coordination and academic performance33,34, questions remain about the optimal types and intensities of physical activity for cognitive enhancement35,36.

The relationship between physical activity and executive function development is mediated through multiple neurobiological and psychological pathways. Lubans et al.37proposed a comprehensive conceptual model identifying several mechanisms through which physical activity may influence cognitive development in youth. These include physiological pathways such as increased cerebral blood flow, elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and structural changes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex regions. Psychological mediators include improved self-efficacy, enhanced motivation, and reduced psychological stress. Understanding these mediating pathways is crucial for optimizing intervention designs that target specific executive function components through tailored physical activity modalities.

Understanding these relationships has become increasingly critical as contemporary educational practices often emphasize cognitive development at the expense of motor skill development. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the positive effects of acute exercise on cognitive performance38,39, suggesting that integrated motor-cognitive interventions might offer promising approaches for enhancing both domains simultaneously40,41. The growing literature highlights the need for greater integration with respect to the framework related to child development to recognize the inherent link between motor skills and cognitive processes.

The current research aims to investigate the diverse effects of three types of structured physical activity interventions—namely, aerobic exercise, coordination training, and team sports—on school children’s executive functioning. Moreover, the study intends to investigate age and gender as moderating factors for the response to the intervention and analyse the relationships between the progression of motor skills and changes in executive functions. With this multidisciplinary approach, we hope to achieve a contribution to the evidence for the use of physical activity as an intervention for enhancing cognitive and motor skill functioning in school-age children with varying developmental needs.

The current study employed a randomized controlled design to systematically assess the effects of different types of physical activities on the facilitation of executive function in school children. Figure1presents a brief summary overview of the overall study design including participant recruitment and classification procedures, intervention protocols, and main outcome measures. With such a comprehensive design, we were well placed to compare the effects of aerobic exercise, coordination exercises and team sports on children’s improvement in executive functioning and in motor skills and to further explore the moderating effects of age and gender on the effects of the different interventions.

Intervention programs and their effects on executive function development in school-aged children.

The diagram captures four core aspects in the research: participant categorization, information about the intervention, selection of assessment scores, and outcome analysis. Four groups of participants (aerobic group, coordination group, team sports group, and control group) received 36 weeks of intervention. Through diversified assessment tools, we observed the differential effects of different intervention modalities on various components of executive function, as well as the characteristics of these effects across different age groups and gender populations.

The study participants were recruited from elementary schools in Beijing, China, through a stratified random sampling approach. A total of 426 children (216 boys and 210 girls) aged 7–12 years (mean age = 9.43 ± 1.52 years) participated in this longitudinal study. The sample size was determined based on previous studies investigating executive functions and motor development, with power analysis conducted using G*Power software indicating that 400 participants would provide 90% power to detect medium effect sizes (d = 0.5) at α = 0.05. Inclusion criteria required participants to be typically developing children without diagnosed neurological, developmental, or physical conditions that might affect motor or cognitive performance. The exclusion criteria included children who presented with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or any chronic medical illness that may impede engagement in physical activities5,6. For every participant, written informed consent was collected from the parents or legal guardians prior to enrolment, and the study protocol received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Normal University. All procedures were performed in compliance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the vetted protocols involving children in research.

Participants were categorised based on age, gender, and executive function tests conducted before the intervention42,43, after which they were randomly assigned using a randomisation protocol with block sizes of eight to three intervention groups and one control group through computer-driven assignment. The intervention groups were: (1) aerobic exercise group (n = 106) which emphasised structured cardiovascular exercises; (2) coordinative exercise group (n = 107) which emphasised complex motor skill development; (3) and team sports group (n = 106) which participated in structured sports activities. The control group (n = 107) maintained their routine physical education class44. To mitigate selection bias, group allocation was executed by research staff blinded to the assessment and implementation of the intervention as part of a double-blind design where assessors and participants did not know the study’s hypotheses45. An independent statistician supervised the randomisation to ensure no imbalance of confounding factors across the groups46.Group equivalence was verified through an assessment of baseline demographic information, motor competence, and executive function measures47. This rigorous grouping procedure is in line with best practice guidelines for intervention studies in the field of developmental research48.

The intervention protocols used in the current study were developed using a multi-theoretical approach that combined elements of cognitive development and motor learning with evidence from neurobiological studies. Three different types of interventions were developed from empirical evidence obtained from previous successful applications38–40, tailored specifically to meet the developmental needs of each age group. All intervention protocols were reviewed by an expert panel before implementation to ensure their scientific validity, safety, and effectiveness. The intensity of interventions and the criteria for progression were guided by normative physical activities for children44, whereas the structuring of the activity content was guided within the framework of combined cognitive stimulation and motor skill enrichment.

We chose aerobic exercise over flexibility training despite limited fitness effects in under-12 children based on important neurobiological advantages. Aerobic activity increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cerebral blood flow, directly supporting executive function development8,9, while more effectively activating prefrontal regions than flexibility training11,12. Recent meta-analyses have confirmed the dose–response relationship between aerobic exercise intensity and executive function improvements in children49,50. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise specifically enhances hippocampal volume and white matter integrity in developing brains51,52. Including aerobic exercise as a traditional benchmark also enables comprehensive comparison across intervention types, enhancing the practical applicability of our findings. The aerobic exercise intervention followed a progressive 36-week program with three weekly 45-min sessions led by certified physical education instructors with cardiovascular training expertise53. Sessions were structured with a 10-min warm-up, 30 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity, and a 5-min cool-down54. The program incorporated circuit training, shuttle runs, jumping jacks, and rhythmic exercises using step platforms, agility ladders, and resistance bands55. Exercise intensity was carefully monitored using heart rate monitors and accelerometers to maintain 65–85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate, with primarily individual activities supplemented by partner and group formations to enhance engagement56. Intensity progressed systematically every four weeks following established protocols to optimize training adaptations57.

The coordinative exercise intervention addressed the higher levels of the taxonomy by integrating complex motor skill development with cognitive-motor integration. The sessions were delivered three times a week for 45 min per session, focusing specifically on bilateral coordination, spatial awareness, and rhythmic activities. The intervention comprised a progression of balance exercises, hand–eye coordination drills, and more advanced choreographed movements. The tasks were intentionally designed to engage several cognitive functions simultaneously, involving selective attention, spatial processing, and adaptability to dynamic changes in task requirements. With special attention to movement accuracy, the exercises were progressively adapted to the individual’s level of achievement and mastery. The proficiency level and execution accuracy of movement in both closed and open skill tasks were emphasised in the programme. Previous research has shown that motor coordination tasks requiring bilateral coordination and rhythmic timing activate cerebellar-frontal networks associated with executive control58,59. Complex motor skill training has been linked to improvements in attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility through enhanced neural connectivity60,61.

The team sports intervention was planned so that its execution involved physical and social cognitive aspects using organised group activities62. Participants took part in three weekly sessions that lasted 45 min each and included adapted basketball, football, and volleyball. The program emphasized tactical decision-making, team cooperation, and strategic planning within the context of competitive play63. Sessions were structured to include skill development (15 min), tactical training (15 min), and modified game play (15 min), with activities designed to promote both individual skill advancement and team coordination64. The intervention incorporated progressive difficulty levels in both technical skills and tactical complexity, while maintaining a focus on inclusive participation and positive social interaction65. Regular rotation of roles and positions ensured comprehensive development of different skill sets and strategic understanding66.

Although this group’s intervention focused on coordination/team skills development, the activity design also considered cardiovascular load, with research showing that participants could achieve moderate-intensity physical activity levels during coordination/team activities. Through activity arrangement and task design, participants maintained heart rates in the target zone (60–75% of maximum heart rate) for at least 50% of the session duration. Unlike the aerobic group, this group did not use continuous heart rate monitoring, but instead employed random sampling, testing 25% of participants weekly to verify activity intensity adequacy. Study results showed that the coordination/team sports groups also achieved significant improvements in VO2max (11.8% and 13.0% respectively), indicating these interventions effectively promoted cardiorespiratory fitness development.

All intervention sessions across the three experimental groups were conducted by certified physical education teachers with specialized training in their respective exercise modalities. These instructors participated in standardized training workshops prior to the intervention and received regular supervision from research staff throughout the program duration to ensure fidelity to the prescribed protocols. The control group maintained their regular physical education curriculum delivered by their usual school teachers, who were instructed not to alter their standard teaching practices during the study period.

The observational measures were systematically implemented to evaluate both primary and secondary outcomes across multiple domains of functioning67. A comprehensive assessment framework was established, as shown in Table1, which details the evaluation protocols for executive functions, motor competence, and associated variables68. All assessments were conducted at predetermined time points by trained researchers who were blinded to group allocation69.

Considering the potential fatigue effects of multiple tests on children, all assessments were spread over three days in a specific order. Physical measurements and aerobic fitness tests were conducted on the first day, executive function assessments on the second day, and motor competence tests on the third day. Each day’s testing time was controlled within 45–60 min, including appropriate rest periods. The interval between tests did not exceed one week to ensure temporal consistency of data. All tests were conducted in quiet, standardized environments by trained researchers following unified procedures. Children were provided with simple explanations and demonstrations before testing to ensure they understood task requirements, while creating a relaxed atmosphere to reduce test anxiety.

The assessment protocol, as indicated in Table1, employs validated instruments with established psychometric properties. Each domain was evaluated using multiple complementary measures to ensure comprehensive assessment of the targeted constructs70,71. The testing sequence was standardized across all participants to minimize order effects and fatigue72. Physiological measurements were integrated with behavioral assessments to provide insight into underlying mechanisms. This multifaceted approach enables detailed analysis of intervention effects across cognitive and motor domains while maintaining high scientific rigor.

The testing battery was administered in a standardized environment to ensure consistency and reliability of measurements. All assessments were conducted at four time points: baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 36 weeks, allowing for systematic tracking of developmental changes throughout the intervention period.

Quality control measures were systematically implemented throughout the study, as detailed in Table2. Rigorous standardization of assessment procedures was maintained through intensive examiner training and regular calibration sessions73. Inter-rater reliability was established through duplicate assessments of 15% of participants, with intraclass correlation coefficients exceeding 0.85 for all measures70. Intervention fidelity was monitored through structured observation protocols and video analysis of randomly selected sessions71. Compliance with intervention protocols was tracked using digital attendance systems and validated activity monitors72, while adverse events were systematically documented and reviewed by an independent safety monitoring board74.

Quality control system and implementation standards for intervention Study.

All quality control measures were implemented according to international research standards and monitored by an independent quality assurance team.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and R version 4.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)75,76. Normality was assessed using Shapiro–Wilk tests. Mixed-effects linear models were employed to analyze longitudinal changes, with group, time, and group × time interaction as fixed effects and subjects as random effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d, and significance was set atp< 0.05. Effect sizes were interpreted according: d = 0.20 indicates a small effect, d = 0.50 indicates a medium effect, and d = 0.80 indicates a large effect. These benchmarks provide standardized criteria for evaluating the practical significance of intervention effects, allowing for meaningful comparisons across different outcome measures and with other studies in the field. Effect sizes ≥ 0.80 were considered to have substantial practical importance for educational applications. Structural equation modeling was conducted using Mplus version 8.6 to examine mediating relationships between variables.

Data visualization approaches incorporated violin plots with embedded box plots to illustrate the probability density distributions of baseline measurements across intervention groups. These visualizations employed kernel density estimation techniques to effectively represent data patterns. For longitudinal analyses, 95% confidence intervals were calculated using advanced bootstrapping methods with 1000 resamples and displayed as error bars in trajectory graphs to demonstrate estimate precision. Correlation relationships between variables were presented through comprehensive heatmap visualizations, where color intensity gradients directly corresponded to correlation coefficient strength, enabling intuitive interpretation of relationship patterns across multiple variables simultaneously.

All effect sizes reported represent the magnitude of change from baseline to post-intervention (36 weeks) compared to the control group, calculated as the difference between group means divided by the pooled standard deviation.

Of the 426 initially enrolled participants, 412 (96.7%) completed all assessments during the 36-week intervention period. Baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics were comparable across all intervention groups, as shown in Table3. The mean age was 9.43 ± 1.52 years, with no significant differences in age distribution among groups (F = 1.24,p= 0.293). Analysis of baseline executive function measures and motor competence revealed no significant between-group differences (p> 0.05 for all comparisons). As illustrated in Fig.2, the initial distribution of cognitive performance scores demonstrated normal distribution patterns across all groups, with comparable means and standard deviations. Socioeconomic status, parental education levels, and previous physical activity experiences were also evenly distributed among groups.

Distribution of baseline executive function scores across intervention groups.

The violin plots show the probability density of the data at different values, with embedded box plots indicating median, interquartile range, and outliers. Equal distribution patterns are observed across all groups, confirming baseline comparability.

Primary outcome analysis revealed significant improvements in executive functions across all intervention groups compared to the control group over the 36-week period, as shown in Table4. The most pronounced enhancements were observed in working memory and cognitive flexibility domains. Mixed-effects model analysis demonstrated significant group × time interactions (p< 0.001), with the coordination exercise group showing the largest effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.89) for overall executive function improvement.While the coordination group showed the largest effect size (d = 0.89), these differences were not statistically significant compared to aerobic (d = 0.76) and team sports (d = 0.72) groups (95% CIs for between-group effect size differences included zero). All three intervention types produced medium to large effect sizes. As illustrated in Fig.3, trajectory analysis revealed differential rates of improvement among the intervention groups, with accelerated gains observed during weeks 12–24. The aerobic and team sports groups demonstrated comparable enhancement patterns in inhibitory control, while the coordination group exhibited superior improvements in task-switching capabilities. The standard deviation remained consistent across all groups throughout the intervention period (range: 8.5–9.4), indicating reliable measurement and homogeneous responses. These findings suggest that structured physical activities, particularly coordination-based exercises, effectively enhance executive functions in school-aged children, likely by challenging multiple cognitive processes simultaneously.

The figure illustrates the temporal progression of executive function composite scores over the 36-week intervention period. Lines represent mean scores for each group, with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals. The coordination group demonstrates the steepest improvement trajectory, followed by the aerobic and team sports groups, while the control group shows minimal change.

Secondary outcome measures demonstrated significant improvements in motor competence and physical fitness parameters across intervention groups, as presented in Table5. Analysis of cardiorespiratory fitness showed marked enhancement in the aerobic group (VO2max increase: 15.3%,p< 0.001), while the coordination group exhibited superior gains in balance and motor precision metrics. Figure4illustrates the differential improvements in motor competence scores across groups, with all intervention groups showing significant advantages over the control group. Notably, the team sports group demonstrated the most substantial improvements in social interaction measures and collective motor skills (p< 0.001).

Each group is represented by distinct line patterns and markers, with the coordination group showing the steepest improvement trajectory. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and markers indicate assessment time points.

Subgroup analyses revealed distinct intervention effects across age and gender categories, as detailed in Table6. Younger participants (7–9 years) showed more pronounced improvements in cognitive flexibility, while older participants (10–12 years) demonstrated greater gains in working memory capacity. Gender-specific analysis indicated differential responses to intervention types, with females showing superior improvements in coordination-based tasks and males exhibiting greater gains in aerobic performance measures, as illustrated in Fig.5. Initial fitness level significantly moderated intervention effects, with lower-baseline participants showing accelerated improvements across all outcome measures (p< 0.001).

The relationship between improvements in executive functions and changes in motor competence across intervention groups was analyzed through correlation analysis, with results visualized in the heatmap presented in Fig.6. This visualization approach was selected for its comprehensive representation of multiple variable relationships simultaneously, allowing for rapid identification of pattern strength and clustering effects.

The present study examined how different physical activity types affect executive functions in school-aged children over 36 weeks. Results revealed that while all physical activity interventions enhanced executive functions compared to controls, coordination exercises showed a numerically larger, though not statistically different, effect compared to aerobic exercise and team sports (Cohen’s d = 0.89) compared to aerobic exercise (d = 0.76) and team sports (d = 0.72). This range of influences supports neurobiological theories linking the complexity of motor coordination with cognitive development.The improvements observed in CANTAB measures align with previous studies using similar neuropsychological assessments in pediatric populations49,50. The specific enhancements in working memory span and cognitive flexibility measured by CANTAB have been validated as sensitive indicators of exercise-induced neuroplasticity51,60.

While all intervention types showed substantial benefits (d > 0.70), coordination exercises demonstrated a trend toward larger effects (d = 0.89), possibly due to their distinctive intellectual requirements, such as constant spatial and multi-dimensional information processing, which may create optimal neural stimulation. It is important to note, however, that the differences between intervention types were not statistically significant, suggesting that all three approaches are valuable for cognitive development. Aerobic exercises showed robust effects (d = 0.76) through mechanisms including enhanced BDNF secretion, increased cerebral blood flow, and neurogenesis, which are particularly beneficial for the developing brain. Team sports also produced substantial improvements (d = 0.72) by blending vigorous physical activity with rich sociocultural contexts that encourage strategic thinking and impulse control.The trend toward larger effects in coordination exercises aligns with theoretical frameworks suggesting that cognitively engaging physical activities provide optimal stimulation for executive function development61. This is supported by meta-analytic evidence showing that qualitative aspects of exercise, particularly cognitive engagement and coordinative complexity, may be more important than quantitative parameters alone49,50.

The superior improvement in motor competence scores observed in the coordination group (22.0%) warrants detailed examination. Our motor competence assessment comprised three standardized tools: Movement ABC-2 (assessing fine motor control including manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance tasks), BOT-2 (evaluating gross motor skills across 8 subtests including bilateral coordination, balance, running speed and agility, and strength), and KTK test (measuring body coordination through backward balancing, one-leg hopping, lateral jumping, and moving sideways). These tests collectively evaluate multiple dimensions including hand–eye coordination, bilateral coordination, dynamic and static balance, movement speed, precision, and rhythm control.

The coordination group’s advantage likely stems from the high congruence between training content and test demands. The group’s training activities—including progressive balance exercises (single-leg stands, balance beam walking, unstable surface training), hand–eye coordination drills (juggling, target throwing, catching exercises), and bilateral coordination tasks requiring precise spatiotemporal control (rope jumping, rhythmic stepping patterns, symmetrical and asymmetrical limb movements)—directly targeted the core skills assessed in motor competence batteries. This “skill specificity” principle is well-supported in motor learning literature. In contrast, the aerobic group primarily emphasized cardiorespiratory function and repetitive movement patterns (running, jumping), which, while improving overall fitness, provided less direct training for complex coordinative skills. The team sports group, though involving complex motor skills, focused more on tactical decision-making and social interaction, with the open-skill variability potentially limiting performance in standardized motor competence tests compared to the targeted training of the coordination group.

The VO2max improvements observed in our study merit detailed comparison with existing literature. The aerobic group showed 15.3% improvement, coordination 11.8%, and team sports 13.0%. These improvements align closely with previous meta-analyses in similar age groups. Pozuelo-Carrascosa et al. (2018) reported that 20–36 week aerobic interventions in children aged 7–12 typically yield 10–20% VO2max gains. García-Hermoso et al. (2020)'s systematic review showed that school-aged children following at least 8 weeks of structured physical activity improved VO2max by an average of 5.0 mL/kg/min, consistent with our findings (aerobic group improved by 7.0 mL/kg/min).

Notably, even though coordination and team sports groups did not primarily focus on aerobic training, they still achieved substantial cardiorespiratory improvements. This supports the concept of “incidental aerobic benefits”—when children engage in activities requiring sustained movement, cardiorespiratory adaptations occur even when skill development is the primary goal. Our activity monitoring data showed that coordination and team sports groups maintained moderate-intensity heart rates (60–75% HRmax) for over 50% of session time, explaining the observed aerobic improvements. This finding aligns with Engel et al. (2018), who found that even skill-based physical activities can produce meaningful cardiorespiratory benefits when activity intensity and duration reach certain thresholds.

The relationship between specific intervention activities and observed cognitive-motor outcomes provides important mechanistic insights. The coordination group’s activities demanded continuous motor planning, error detection, and real-time correction—cognitive requirements that may explain why this group showed advantages in both executive functions and motor competence. For instance, balance beam walking requires sustained attention (monitoring body position), working memory (remembering movement sequences), and cognitive flexibility (adapting to balance adjustments). This “cognitive-motor dual-task” nature activates cerebellar-prefrontal networks that support both motor control and executive functions58,59.

In contrast, the aerobic group’s activities (circuit training, shuttle runs), while effectively enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness and overall executive functions, challenged complex motor skills less due to their relatively simple and repetitive movement patterns, potentially explaining this group’s smaller improvements in motor competence tests (17.6%). However, aerobic exercise provided robust neurobiological support for cognitive development through increased BDNF, improved cerebral blood flow, and hippocampal neurogenesis. The team sports group faced unique challenges—rapid decision-making in dynamic, unpredictable environments particularly benefited inhibitory control and social skill development, but the high variability of open-skill environments may have limited performance in standardized motor competence assessments.

Most notably, the control group exhibited minimal gains (d ≈ 0.10) without formally participating in physical education, which points to erroneous standard curricula as the root cause which inherently fails to provide sufficient mental stimulation. Such outcomes correspond with De Niet et al.77who, in gross motor skills benchmarking within a year timeframe, highlighted significant intra- and inter-child heterogeneity with some children showing almost no progress. That study advanced the consideration that developmental paths are greatly heterogeneous in children even within relatively short durations.

These differences emphasize the heterogeneity of the present study’s 36-week intervention. Though notable improvements were recorded in the mid-term, the enduring nature of such progress poses substantial uncertainty. The intervention timeframe, though substantial at 36 weeks, may be insufficient to determine whether the observed cognitive enhancements persist beyond the intervention period, particularly given the variable developmental trajectories documented by De Niet and colleagues. Future research should incorporate extended follow-up assessments to evaluate whether these improvements maintain, dissipate, or continue to develop over years rather than months.

Gender differences emerged: females showed greater improvements in coordination tasks while males exhibited superior aerobic adaptations. Age-stratification revealed younger children (7–9 years) gained more in cognitive flexibility, while older children (10–12 years) demonstrated greater working memory enhancement, indicating age-dependent plasticity in executive function components.

Strong correlations between motor competence improvements and executive function gains (r = 0.58–0.72) provide compelling evidence for their interdependent development, consistent with the cognitive-motor interaction theory58,59. These correlations are supported by neurobiological evidence showing shared neural substrates between motor control and executive functions61. Individual differences in baseline fitness and motor competence significantly moderated intervention effects, highlighting the necessity for personalized physical activity approaches that account for the heterogeneous development patterns observed in children’s motor and cognitive skills.

These findings support integrating diverse physical activities, particularly coordination exercises, into educational curricula, while acknowledging the limitation that optimal intervention duration and long-term developmental impacts remain to be determined through more extended longitudinal research designs.

This study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, although the 36-week intervention period was relatively long, the lack of follow-up assessments limits our understanding of the sustainability of intervention effects77. Future studies should include retention tests at 6 and 12 months post-intervention to determine whether the observed cognitive enhancements persist over time.

Second, the control group received only regular physical education rather than an active control intervention (such as stretching or low-intensity activities), which may have overestimated intervention effects as any structured activity might produce non-specific benefits. Third, while assessors were blinded, participants and instructors could not be blinded to group allocation, potentially introducing expectancy effects or differential motivation.

Fourth, the sample was recruited exclusively from schools in Beijing, China, limiting generalizability to different geographical regions, socioeconomic contexts, or educational systems. Children in urban Chinese settings may differ from other populations in baseline physical activity levels, academic pressure, and parental support. Fifth, we did not assess physical activity outside the intervention sessions, which could have confounded the observed effects.

Sixth, although CANTAB is a validated tool, repeated testing may have led to practice effects, though the minimal changes in the control group suggest this influence was limited. Seventh, we did not collect neuroimaging or biomarker data to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed behavioral changes. Finally, while we controlled for baseline differences, unmeasured confounders such as family physical activity habits, nutritional status, or sleep quality may have influenced outcomes.

Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable contributions to the field through its rigorous randomized controlled design, multiple assessment timepoints, and comprehensive outcome measures. Future research should address these limitations to further clarify the relationship between physical activity and cognitive development in children.

This longitudinal study provides evidence that structured physical activity interventions enhance executive functions in school-aged children, with coordination-based exercises showing the most pronounced effects. Our findings suggest the relationship between motor competence and cognitive development is influenced by both age and gender, as demonstrated by the differential responses across intervention modalities. The coordination exercise group exhibited superior improvements in executive function components, particularly in working memory and cognitive flexibility, indicating complex motor tasks may provide optimal stimulation for cognitive development. These findings have educational implications, suggesting integrated physical activity programs emphasizing coordinative elements should be incorporated into school curricula. Educational approaches should consider individual differences in baseline fitness levels and motor competence when designing interventions. Future research should focus on optimizing intervention parameters and investigating the long-term retention of these improvements across developmental stages, with emphasis on personalized approaches for children with varying cognitive and motor profiles.
