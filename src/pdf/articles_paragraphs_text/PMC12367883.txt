We read with interest the study by Havan et al. entitled “Effect of sarcopenia on postoperative major complications after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal surface malignancy: a retrospective cohort study” [1].

The findings that sarcopenia independently increases the risk of major postoperative complications are consistent with the literature that recognises muscle mass depletion as a critical factor affecting surgical outcomes in oncological populations [2–4]. Havan et al. [1] evaluated sarcopenia using the skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 vertebral level, a recognised and validated approach. However, recent international guidelines emphasise a multidimensional approach that includes not only muscle mass but also strength and physical performance [5,6]. Measures such as handgrip strength and gait speed have been shown to predict postoperative morbidity and long-term outcomes, with equal or even superior prognostic value compared to radiological parameters alone [7].

Sarcopenia is a modifiable preoperative risk factor in addition to being a prognostic marker. Randomised studies and meta-analyses provide evidence for the effectiveness of multimodal prehabilitation, which integrates tailored dietary assistance, resistance exercise, and psychological optimisation to enhance physiological reserve prior to major surgery [8–10]. Prehabilitation in colorectal cancer patients has been associated with shorter hospital stay, improved postoperative functional recovery, and reduced complication rates. Given the high physiologic burden of CRS/HIPEC and the prevalence of preexisting catabolic states in peritoneal carcinomatosis, this population may particularly benefit from such interventions.

Systemic inflammation is a primary catalyst of cancer-related sarcopenia. The relationship among inflammatory indicators (e.g. C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), sarcopenia, and postoperative morbidity is thoroughly established [11,12]. Incorporating these markers into preoperative assessment models may help identify “inflammatory sarcopenia”, which indicates poorer outcomes and requires more aggressive optimisation. We also suggest that recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled imaging analysis, including automated segmentation of muscle tissue from routine preoperative CT scans, may facilitate large-scale, standardised screening for sarcopenia in surgical oncology workflows [13]. These technologies provide swift, objective measurement and can be incorporated into current radiology software to initiate automated referrals for prehabilitation in high-risk patients (Table1).

In conclusion, rigorous perioperative modelling of sarcopenia in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC must encompass functional sarcopenia, inflammatory biomarkers, and structured prehabilitation. This modelling ought to be incorporated into preoperative standard protocols to enhance surgical outcomes and quality of life for patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC. Prospective studies incorporating functional sarcopenia measures, inflammatory profiling, and AI-assisted screening are necessary to validate and implement this methodology in clinical practices.
