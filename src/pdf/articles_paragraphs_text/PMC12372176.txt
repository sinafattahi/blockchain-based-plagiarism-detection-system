Blood Disease of Banana brought on byRalstonia syzygiisubsp.celebesensis(Rsc) results in yield losses in Indonesia up to 90%. Among the symptoms are wilting, vascular staining, fruit rot, and plant death. Pathogen travels via contaminated tools, water runoff, pests, and pollinators. Originally reported in South Sulawesi, it now affects all of the main Indonesian islands as well as Malaysia. Though its influence is known, understanding of Rsc pathogenesis is less than that ofRalstonia solanacearum. This study investigates the different genome of Rsc isolate from Bali, geographically separated by the Wallace Line, and compares them to published genomes from Yogyakarta.

The data presented were obtained as a byproduct of a broader genomic survey on Rsc diversity. The genome structure and G + C content analysis of Rsc, which was isolated fromMusa balbisianacultivarKepokin Bali, is included in the draft genome sequence. The genome’s size, coding sequence patterns, and functional annotations were assessed after being assembled from scratch. Genome analysis pipeline was used to process each sequencing data separately using protocols created for Oxford Nanopore sequencing outputs. Comparative analysis with the Yogyakarta isolate highlights molecular variations likely influenced by geographic isolation across the Wallace Line.

Ralstonia syzygiisubsp.celebesensis (Rsc) is the causal agent of Blood Disease of Banana (BDB) which significantly impacts Banana (Musasp.) [1,2]. As a nation with a high diversity of bananas, BDB is the top-level important disease of banana in Indonesia with a yield loss up to 90%. The symptoms of BDB are wilting, red-brown vascular staining starting from the fruit peduncle to the true stem, discolored and rotten fruits, and dying of the infected plant [3,4]. The disease is spread through the inoculum-contaminated animals including pollinators visiting the male buds and influorescents, stem or corm borer pests, agricultural tools, and surface running water from the residue of infected materials [5]. The first incidence of BDB was reported in the islands in South Sulawesi (Celebes), Indonesia in the 1900s. Recently BDB has been reported in all main Islands of Indonesia and Malaysia [6,7]. Effective control measures are urgently needed to prevent further spread of this pathogen. While it is well established that Rsc spreads via human-mediated mechanisms particularly through the movement of infected plant materials the extent to which geographic or ecological barriers shape the genetic structure of Rsc populations remains unclear. Compared to its close relativeRalstonia solanacearum, relatively little is known about the molecular basis of Rsc pathogenicity and its interaction with host plants. To contribute to this knowledge gap, this study aims to explore the genomic characteristics of an Rsc isolate from Bali and compare it to a published genome from Yogyakarta (Java) [8]. These two regions are situated on opposite sides of the Wallace Line, a well-known biogeographic boundary. This comparative genomic approach is intended to assess whether regional divergence exists between Rsc populations, which could reflect historical separation, ecological differentiation, or limited gene flow despite the potential for long-distance human-mediated dispersal.

Genome sequence ofRalstonia syzygiisubsp.celebesensisisolated fromMusa balbisianacultivar Kepok in Bali consists of the genome structure and G-C percentage, genome was de novo assembled and analyzed to gain information about genome length, CDS pattern, and also annotation. All the data was collected and processed individually based on the Genome Analysis Pipeline supporting sequence produced from Oxford Nanopore sequencing with its protocol described below.

Rsc isolate UGMITBRKI_24001 was isolated from aMusa balbisianacultivarKepokwith blood disease of banana-specified symptom located in Buleleng, Bali, Indonesia (8.089265 S 115.234645 E). The isolate was grown on casein peptone glucose (CPG) medium and identified asRalstonia syzygiisubsp.celebesensisbased on a series of tests: it was Gram-negative, positive in Kovac’s oxidation test, induced a hypersensitive reaction on tobacco leaves, and caused typical blood disease symptoms on banana plants at 21 days post-inoculation with 10⁵ CFU. Molecular confirmation was performed using PCR with the Rsc-specific primer 121 F/R [1,8]. Three days confirmed isolated was extracted to gain genomic DNA using Bacteria Genomic DNA Kit (Geneaid, Taiwan). DNA concentration and purification were assessed using NanoDrop spectrophotometers resulting in gDNA concentration > 200 ng µl− 1with a DNA purity ratio of absorbance at 260/280 nm of 1.72 then proceed to library preparation step using SQK-RBK114 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) following with its protocols. Genome was sequenced using MinION (Oxford nanopore Tech., UK) with the MinKNOW software 23.04.6 (Oxford Nanopore Tech, UK) also for Basecalling the raw sequence [8]. Genome analysis was done using Galaxy Cloud Program (https://usegalaxy.org.au/) and fastQC (Galaxy Version 0.74 + galaxy1) was performed to know reads quality of the sequence. Sequencing reads were filtered using Filtlong (Galaxy Version 0.2.1 + galaxy0) with a minimum length threshold of 1000 bp and an output threshold targeting approximately 130× genome coverage, based on an estimated genome size of 5.2 Mb. Read quality was visualized using NanoPlot, and Flye (Galaxy Version 2.9.5 + galaxy0) was used for de novo assembly in Nanopore-corrected mode, with reduced coverage applied during the initial disjointing assembly step [9–12]. Annotation was performed using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) followed by CheckM analysis to know genome completeness with the Ralstonia CheckM marker set [13]. Annotation result shown in Data file 1 and visualized in Data file 2. The raw sequence reads were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under accession SRX28572606 and the incomplete genome assembly was deposited in GenBank under BioProject PRJNA580360, BioSample accession SAMN45032525 and genome sequence assembly accession on GCA_046245135.1. Genome comparison was performed using OAT: OrthoANI Tool v0.93.1 to know the different between Rsc genome from west Indonesia UGMSS_Db01 and the first genome ofRalstonia solanacearumGMI1000 [8,14] with the result presented on Data file 4. An overview of the data files and repositories used in this study is summarized in Table1.

The pathogen isRalstonia syzygiisubsp.celebesensiswhich is isolated, identified and stored in Department of Plant Protection, Universitas Gadjah Mada under the isolate name UGMITBRKI_24001. The isolate was specified in exact location mention in the paper (Buleleng, Bali, Indonesia fromMusa balbisianacultivarKepok).The genome assembly of isolate UGMITBRKI_24001 is incomplete. The assembly has a completeness of 67.46% based on CheckM analysis, a total genome size of approximately 5.2 Mb, and an N50 of 3.8 Mb. The assembly consists of 2 contigs with a genome coverage of 130×. These metrics indicate that while the depth of sequencing was sufficient, the assembly is fragmented and lacks full completeness.
