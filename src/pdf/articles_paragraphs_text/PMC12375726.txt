This study aimed to assess the resilience, empowerment, and benefit finding of colorectal cancer patients in China and to examine the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between empowerment and benefit finding. Three hundred and eleven colorectal cancer patients were recruited from January to July 2023. The questionnaire included a general information questionnaire, a resilience scale (CD-RISC-10), a Chinese cancer empowerment questionnaire (CEQ), and a patient benefit finding scale (BFS). Structural equation models were used to evaluate whether resilience was a mediator between empowerment and benefit finding. Our research found that colorectal cancer patients’ resilience score was 19.408 ± 9.011, their empowerment score was 117.453 ± 32.995, and their benefit finding score was 65.752 ± 18.756. Empowerment was positively correlated with resilience (r= 0.116,p< 0.05), resilience was positively correlated with benefit finding (r= 0.187,p< 0.01), and empowerment was positively correlated with benefit finding (r= 0.22,p< 0.01). The fitness indices of the structural models were satisfactory. The indirect effect (a*b) of this pathway (empowerment > resilience > benefit finding) was 0.011 (95% CI 0.003 ~ 0.054). The total effect (c) of empowerment on benefit finding was 0.125 (0.063–0.187), and resilience plays a partial mediating role between empowerment and benefit finding, with the mediating effect (a*b/c) constituting 8.8%. Our research results show that most patients with colorectal cancer exhibit moderate levels of resilience. Resilience plays a partial mediating role in empowerment and benefit finding. Enhancing patients’ resilience is one way to increase benefit finding.

According to 2020 international cancer data, colorectal cancer accounted for 12.2% of new cancer cases in China, ranking as the second most common cancer1. Analysis predicts a further increase in colorectal cancer incidence cases in China by 20302. Health education for patients with colorectal cancer, a disease with high morbidity and mortality3has become a research focus4. Psychological intervention in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery has been found to significantly enhance cognitive function and mental health status5. Empowerment, benefit finding, and resilience are pivotal concepts in psychotherapy for cancer patients and represent their coping philosophy, decision-making ability, self-worth, and meaning of life, which significantly influence recovery and sense of happiness6–8.

Resilience was identified as a mediator in the positive or negative aspects of illness8.

Previous studies have revealed the important role of resilience in patients with colorectal cancer9. Üzar-Özçetin et al. demonstrated that the empowerment program significantly improved Posttraumatic growth and resilience levels in cancer survivors10. Tsai, T et al. examined the unique associations of the resilience factor and benefit finding over the first year after a colorectal cancer diagnosis11. Preliminary evidence suggests resilience trajectories significantly impacted social function trajectories in Chinese Colorectal Cancer Patients12. Benefit finding serves as a critical component within the resilience framework developed by Ye et al. for Chinese cancer patients13. These findings collectively point to the possibility that resilience may play a mediating role between empowerment and benefit finding. However, to our knowledge, the specific situation of this potential relationship in the Chinese colorectal cancer patient population has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, this study aims to explore how resilience may influence the relationship between empowerment and benefit finding. Our theoretical framework (Fig.1) integrates the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping14and Patient Empowerment Theory15. Empowerment enhances perceived control, which builds resilience through adaptive coping16. Resilience then facilitates cognitive reappraisal, enabling benefit finding17. This pathway showing resilience mediates positive adaptation, but remains unexamined in Chinese colorectal cancer populations where cultural contexts may modulate these mechanisms. We plan to use data collected from Chinese colorectal cancer patients to validate the three key hypotheses under this framework.

Three hundred and eleven colorectal cancer patients were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province. The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: (1) aged between 18 and 80 years and (2) medical survival time was predicted to be at least 6 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) unwilling to participate in the study and (2) mental disorders detected by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants’ mean age was 58.2 ± 10.3 years (range: 32–79), with 196 males (63%) and 115 females (37%).

Data were collected through convenience sampling methods from January to July 2023. After providing written informed consent, 330 colorectal cancer patients completed a questionnaire consisting of four parts: general information, a Chinese version of the Cancer Empowerment Scale, a Chinese adapted version of the benefit finding scale, and a 10-item Connor–Davidson resilience scale. A total of 311 (94.24%) participants completed the entire valid questionnaire independently in the oncology ward. Data collectors received standardized training to minimize bias. Missing data (< 5%) were handled via full information maximum likelihood (FIML) in SEM.

The self-reported general information questionnaire included questions about age, sex, residence, education, medical expense payments, caregiver type and tumor stage.

The questionnaire was adapted from the Netherlands Empowerment Questionnaire (NEQ) by van den Berg et al.18. The Chinese version was cross-culturally adapted by Han X et al.19. It includes 19 items for personal strength, 9 items for social support, 6 items for community, and 6 items for health care. The respondents used a 5-point Likert scale to rate each item on the basis of perceived positivity. Each item is rated up to 5 points, and the total score is calculated by summing all the scores. The maximum total score is 200, with a higher score indicating a higher level of empowerment. In the Chinese context, the Cronbach’s α of the questionnaire was 0.96, and the correlation coefficients between dimensions ranged from 0.665 to 0.837.

The Chinese version of the Benefit Finding Scale (BFS), adapted by Liu et al.20from Weaver et al.‘s21original instrument, comprises 22 items assessing six dimensions: acceptance (items 1–3), family relationships (items 4–5), worldview (items 6–9), personal growth (items 10–16), social relations (items 17–19), and health behavior (items 20–22). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score is calculated by summing all item responses, yielding a possible range of 22 to 110, with higher scores indicating greater levels of benefit finding (e.g., enhanced acceptance of illness, improved interpersonal relationships, or perceived personal growth). In the validation study by Liu et al., the Chinese version demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.95), supporting its reliability in measuring positive psychological adaptation among cancer patients.

The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), originally developed by Campbell-Sills and Stein16measures resilience through self-reported responses on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not true at all to 4 = true nearly all the time). Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The Chinese version of the CD-RISC-10 was validated by Ye et al.22in a clinical population, demonstrating strong psychometric properties. Specifically, the scale exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.873) and satisfactory construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA: RMSEA = 0.036, CFI = 0.937). This adaptation has been widely utilized in Chinese patient populations, confirming its reliability and cultural appropriateness for assessing resilience in oncology contexts.

Data entry and management were performed using EpiData 3.1 (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables are summarized as means ± standard deviations. The impact of sociodemographic characteristics on resilience, empowerment, and benefit finding was assessed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Pearson correlation analysis was employed to explore the relationships among empowerment, resilience, and benefit finding. Structural equation modeling was performed using AMOS 28.0 (IBM SPSS). This study complies with the STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional reporting. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to test the hypothesized mediation model, with model fit evaluated using the following indices: chi-square/degrees of freedom (χ2/df), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and normed fit index (NFI). The significance of indirect effects was assessed using the Bootstrap method with 5,000 resamples. Effects were considered statistically significant if the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) did not include zero23. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The study received ethical approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (KY2023278) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants received a verbal explanation of the study’s purpose and provided written informed consent. Questionnaires were administered in private settings to ensure confidentiality.

Among the 311 surveyed patients, 67% lived in rural areas, 85% had ≤ junior high education, 97% used medical insurance, 82% were cared for by relatives, and 61% had stage III or IV tumors. As shown in Table1. In Table2, the average resilience score was 19.408 ± 9.011, the benefit finding score was 65.751 ± 8.756, and the empowerment score was 117.453 ± 32.995.

The correlation analysis in Table2revealed significant relationships between the variables. Empowerment was positively correlated with resilience (r= 0.116,p< 0.05), resilience was positively correlated with benefit finding (r= 0.187,p< 0.01), and empowerment was positively correlated with benefit finding (r= 0.22,p< 0.01). These findings suggest that mediation analysis was feasible. Among (Cancer Empowerment Questionnaire, CEQ) subdimensions, Healthcare showed the strongest correlation with benefit finding (r= 0.264,p< 0.01), suggesting that patient-provider communication and access to medical resources are pivotal for fostering positive adaptation.

We utilized structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse and refine the data, creating a mediation model with empowerment as the independent variable, resilience as the mediating variable, and benefit finding as the dependent variable. After multiple tests and adjustments, the fitness indices of the structural models were satisfactory: χ2/df = 2.665, RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.965, NFI = 0.945.

As depicted in Fig.2, empowerment positively influences resilience (standardized path coefficient = 0.116, z = 2.061,p= 0.039 < 0.05). Similarly, resilience significantly impacts benefit finding (standardized path coefficient = 0.164). As depicted in Table3, the indirect effect (a*b) of the pathway (Empowerment > Resilience > Benefit Finding) was 0.011 (95% CI 0.003 ~ 0.054). The total effect (c) of empowerment on benefit finding was 0.125 (0.063–0.187), and resilience partially mediated the relationship between empowerment and benefit finding, with a mediating effect (a*b/c) of 8.8%. This partial mediation (accounting for 8.8% of the total effect) indicates resilience transmits only a portion of empowerment’s influence on benefit finding. The significant direct effect (β = 0.114, 91.2% of total effect) implies other parallel mediators exist beyond resilience.

Empowerment demonstrated a statistically significant positive effect on resilience (β = 0.116,p= 0.039). Clinically, each standard deviation increase in empowerment corresponded to an 11.6% elevation in resilience scores. This relationship aligns with Bandura’s self-efficacy theory24wherein perceived control scaffolds adaptive capacity. Wang M.‘s research25revealed a strong link between empowerment and resilience. The implementation of a telephone follow-up programme based on empowerment not only enhances resilience but also promotes it. High resilience is associated with less anxiety and depression, faster recovery, and greater self-efficacy26. Our study also confirms this relationship in colorectal cancer patients, revealing a significant positive correlation between empowerment and resilience.

Resilience exerted a robust influence on benefit finding (β = 0.164,p= 0.003). The Worldview subscale exhibited the strongest association (r= 0.953p< 0.01), indicating cognitive reframing serves as the primary pathway. This supports Tedeschi and Calhoun’s post-traumatic growth model27. Several studies have highlighted the significant role of resilience in shaping Benefit Finding. For example, Wu Y et al. study28emphasized this point, whereas Sears et al.29long-term observation of early breast cancer patients revealed that optimistic individuals are more likely to seek positive meaning from their experience with the disease. Phipps et al.30further supported this conclusion by indicating a positive correlation between optimism and benefit finding. They also noted that optimistic pediatric patients often derive more positive experiences from their anticancer journey. Additionally, Currier et al.‘s31study revealed the detrimental impact of pessimistic moods on Benefit Finding. Building upon these findings, our study confirmed a positive correlation between resilience and Benefit Finding among CRC patients.

The mediation analysis revealed partial mediation, with resilience accounting for 8.8% of empowerment’s total effect on benefit finding. Resilience represents one of multiple pathways -consistent with Compensatory Model32where alternative resources (e.g., robust social support system33or spiritual frameworks34may compensate when resilience is low. Interventions should target resilience alongside direct factors to maximize benefit finding suggesting targeted interventions such as psychological group counselling35and cognitive behavioural therapy36could enhance adaptive outcomes. However, the generalizability of findings is constrained by the overrepresentation of rural residents (67%), individuals with low educational attainment (85% ≤ junior high school), and advanced-stage patients (61% Stage III/IV). Rural populations often face systemic disparities in healthcare access and health literacy, which may attenuate empowerment scores, while advanced tumor stages—associated with heightened mortality awareness—could paradoxically enhance Benefit Finding ( BF) through existential reappraisal. To strengthen external validity, future research should adopt stratified sampling strategies encompassing diverse geographic, socioeconomic, and disease-stage subgroups, explicitly examining how these contextual factors interact with psychosocial mechanisms such as resilience and empowerment dynamics.

In conclusion, this study identified a robust positive correlation among resilience, empowerment, and benefit finding in colorectal cancer patients, with resilience partially mediating the relationship between empowerment and benefit finding. These findings enhance our understanding of the psychosocial mechanisms underlying mental health in this population and highlight actionable pathways for intervention. Specifically, resilience-building strategies—such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adaptive coping, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and empowerment-oriented psychoeducation—could be systematically integrated into clinical care to amplify patients’ capacity to derive meaning from their illness experience. By targeting modifiable factors like self-efficacy and emotional regulation, such interventions may strengthen resilience, thereby indirectly fostering benefit finding through the pathways identified in this study. Furthermore, the development of multidisciplinary protocols that combine psychological support (e.g., resilience training) with patient empowerment initiatives (e.g., shared decision-making workshops) could optimize holistic care. Future research should prioritize evaluating the efficacy of these hybrid models in improving psychosocial outcomes (e.g., benefit finding, quality of life) and clinical indicators (e.g., treatment adherence, immune function), ultimately advancing patient-centered oncology care.
