The systematic review determines whether valve-sparing surgeries improve patient outcomes compared with non valve-sparing surgeries for tetralogy of Fallot. Although previous studies have reported superior outcomes in valve-sparing surgery, no systematic review has compared these outcomes with those of nonsurgical surgical methods.

In the present research, we address this gap in the literature by comparing valve-sparing and non valve-sparing surgery outcomes. PubMed, PubMed Central, and Medline served as the databases for data collection; following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search strategy identified relevant articles for the review; the search strategy included Medical Subject heading (MeSH) terms and important keywords. The search strategy initially revealed seventy articles; these were further screened by title and abstract and refined to fifteen articles for full-text analysis. For further full-paper analysis, eight articles were refined and formed the basis of our analysis. There was a severe limitation of high-quality clinical trials and prospective studies, and we included any good-quality papers that passed the quality check and adhered to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The number of patients included in this study was 962 from 8 studies; 351 underwent valve-sparing surgery, and 611 underwent TOF correction via non valve-sparing methods. This systematic review provides encouraging evidence that suggests better outcomes for valve-sparing surgery. Most studies have consistently reported a significantly lower prevalence of moderate or severe pulmonary regurgitation in valve-sparing surgeries. Since the valve-sparing technique allows for the preservation of the native valves, it allows for better growth of the pulmonary valve. Additionally, most studies reported that valve-sparing surgeries significantly improved proper ventricular function, but mixed results regarding reintervention have been reported. The risk of complications was similar between the surgical modalities; valve-sparing repair has consistently outperformed other surgical modalities. Low birth weight remains a prominent risk factor even for valve-sparing surgery.

In summary, the evidence presented in this review strongly supports the use of valve-sparing surgery for improved patient outcomes. This systematic review highlights the benefits of valve-sparing surgery over other surgical techniques. It can be a foundation for clinical practice that allows surgeons to make better, informed decisions about patient care. The limitations of the lack of studies found when this review was conducted can further guide other research, strengthen the evidence, and lead to better patient care.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, with surgical intervention being dictated by patient-specific anatomical and clinical factors. While the choice of surgical technique is determined by these preoperative factors, evaluating postoperative outcomes remains essential to optimizing patient care. In addition, inadequate early intervention contributes to an annual increase in the prevalence of congenital heart disease [1]. Congenital heart disease affects approximately 1% of live births. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, contributing to 7–10% of all congenital heart defects [2]. There are no known genetic or environmental causative agents of TOF, but many associations exist, such as untreated maternal diabetes, phenylketonuria, retinoic acid intake, and trisomy 13, 18, and 21 [3]. The tetralogy of Fallot pathology occurs during embryogenesis and is pathognomy with four distinct features: pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. This tetrad of features comes from a structural abnormality in utero that results in anterior and leftward displacement of the infundibular septum [2]. There is variation in the severity of symptoms. Nevertheless, the determining factor for the severity level seems to be the degree of blood flow obstruction through the right ventricular outflow tract [4]. Most cases of Tetralogy of Fallot present within the first few months of life, often with cyanosis, though the timing can vary depending on the severity of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, prominence of a systolic murmur, and accompanied clubbing in chronically cyanotic patients [5]. However, clubbing has become more unusual in the modern era as diagnosed patients undergo surgical repair before clubbing can develop.

More than half of the cases of tetralogy of Fallot are diagnosed antenatally via fetal echocardiography [6]. It can also be diagnosed via a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, or echocardiogram. Other diagnostic tools include chest radiographs, which may show a ‘boot-shaped’ heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy and a decreased main pulmonary artery segment [7]. Without surgical intervention, survival rates drop significantly, with only about 3% reaching 40 years of age [8]. Patient death from tetralogy of Fallot is due to hypoxia, cerebrovascular events, and brain abscesses. For patients who survive, adults face complications due to chronic issues, including the hemodynamic consequences of chronic pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular arrhythmia, and a lifetime of follow-up with cardiologists. There are also conflicting studies that show the effects of chronic cyanosis; studies that report impact cites impaired motor skills, decreased academic achievement, and worsened behavior [3]. When TOF is diagnosed, TOF repair involves closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and relief of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. The method of RVOT relief varies based on patient-specific anatomy and may include transannular patch (TAP), valve-sparing repair, or other techniques such as infundibular muscle resection or pulmonary valvotomy. These surgical techniques are effective in relieving RVOT obstruction and improving oxygenation, thereby addressing the primary pathophysiology of TOF. With a transannular patch, there are also consequences of increased right ventricular dilatation, arrhythmia, reintervention, and pulmonary valve replacement. Essentially, a transannular patch creates a state of chronic pulmonary regurgitation [3]. Advancements in surgical techniques, including trans-atrial and transpulmonary approaches, have enabled valve-sparing procedures in appropriately selected TOF patients, preserving the native pulmonary valve when feasible.

There are good outcomes for patients with TOF due to the development of surgery and enhanced health care. With surgical correction, more than 95% of patients with TOF survive into adulthood. In contrast, among patients who do not undergo corrective surgery, more than 70% are expected to die before reaching adulthood [5]. Early TOF repair is typically performed between 2 and 12 months of age, with optimal timing often between 3 and 6 months in asymptomatic cases, balancing surgical risks and pulmonary vascular development. Early TOF repair in children is one of the surgical improvements that has contributed to these outcomes. Early TOF repair can reduce the negative development of the lungs; in children with TOF, the developing pulmonary vasculature has abnormally reduced flow and pressure, which leads to a reduced cross-sectional area for gas exchange in the lungs. Additionally, failure to repair TOF early can lead to decreased right ventricular compliance, lower left ventricular function, and the presence of arrhythmias [9]. Despite positive outcomes for patients with TOF, improvements in surgical outcomes still have not advanced fast enough. As the prevalence of congenital heart disease increases, continuous refinements in surgical techniques are crucial to improving long-term outcomes for TOF patients. While TOF repair strategies are well established, ongoing discussions exist regarding the optimal timing of repair—particularly the choice between early primary repair and staged palliation in certain high-risk neonates. Additionally, while existing classifications differentiate TOF from TOF with pulmonary atresia, clinical decision-making remains highly individualized based on anatomical and hemodynamic factors, such as duct-dependent circulation and MAPCAs. Rather than relying solely on rigid classification schemes, surgical decisions are tailored to patient-specific presentations. Although there is a growing preference for correcting TOF within the first year of life, the ideal timing remains a subject of discussion. Current practice generally favors performing repair once the infant reaches approximately 6 kg, but in cases of significant cyanosis or hemodynamic instability, earlier intervention may be necessary. Factors contributing to this debate include ongoing discussions regarding the optimal timing of TOF repair within the first year of life, particularly balancing the benefits of early correction with potential risks in smaller infants. While neonatal repair is generally avoided when possible, most centers aim to perform TOF correction as soon as the infant reaches an appropriate weight threshold, typically around 6 kg [10]. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery reported that despite evolving treatment strategies, there are limited data to help clinicians make decisions [7]. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of preserving the native pulmonary valve in TOF repair for patients in whom valve-sparing techniques are feasible, compared with the non-valve-sparing approach. It is well recognized that the pulmonary annular diameter is a key determinant of surgical strategy, and valve-sparing repair is only applicable in patients with an adequate annulus. In cases of significant annular hypoplasia, transannular patch repair or other techniques are required to relieve right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. While the choice of surgical strategy is dictated by anatomical and clinical considerations, understanding the long-term functional outcomes of these approaches may aid in optimizing postoperative care and patient counseling.

This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [11]. The data were collected from the PubMed, Medline, and PubMed Central medical research databases. The library searches included a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords coupled with Booleans (AND, OR, NOT), which were used to find the citations included in this paper. The following search strings were used to find citations. (“Tetralogy of Fallot/surgery“[Mesh] OR ((“Tetralogy of Fallot” OR TOF) AND surgery)) AND ((“valve repair” OR “valve-sparing repair”) AND (“ventricular function” OR “right ventricle”)) OR ((“valve repair” OR “valve-sparing repair”) NOT “replacement”) OR ((“valve repair” OR “valve-sparing repair”) AND (“ejection fraction” OR “regurgitation fraction”))). The highly refined search string, including MeSH terms and keywords, identified 70 studies for the following title and abstract screening; 15 articles were selected for further evaluation. All of these were retrospective review articles.

Studies published in English, which involved treating a population with Tetralogy of Fallot who underwent valve-sparing repair surgery, and articles that provided a nuanced understanding of this particular topic. Owing to a lack of high-quality clinical trials and prospective observational studies, we included any good-quality articles we could find from inception. The libraries have been searching for articles since their inception. Articles irrelevant to this review, full articles in languages other than English, studies with populations other than those diagnosed with the Tetralogy of Fallot who did not undergo valve-sparing repair surgery, technical analysis studies, expert opinions, letters to the editor, animal studies, gray literature, reviews, and citations whose full-text articles were not available were ineligible and hence excluded from this analysis. As surgical selection is driven by anatomical and clinical factors, this review focuses on evaluating the outcomes of these preselected patients rather than determining the best surgical approach for all TOF cases. The included studies inherently reflect patient selection biases, as patients undergoing valve-sparing repair typically had favorable anatomical features. The inclusion and exclsuion criteria for the study are listed in Table1.

Two investigators independently screened 70 citations on the basis of title/abstract. Following primary screening, two authors reviewed the full texts of the remaining articles for eligibility. A third author resolved any conflicts. This screening has been shown through the PRISMA flow diagram.

The key findings from the reviewed studies are presented in (Table3), which highlights the comparative effectiveness of valve-sparing and non-valve-sparing techniques.

A total of 1682 patients were included in this study from 9 studies, the individual study sample sizes ranged from 13 to 720 patients in a study, and the studies published spanning from the year of 2010 to 2023; From the included studies 600 patients underwent valve-sparing surgery, and 1082 patients underwent TOF correction via nonvalve-sparing methods were included in this analysis.

The analyzed studies focused on outcomes of TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot) repair surgeries using different techniques such as transannular patch (TAP), valve-sparing repair (VSR), and RV-PA conduit. These included changes in right and left ventricular (RV and LV) size and function over time, the impact of transannular patch (TAP) versus valve-sparing (VS) repair on ventricular function, and the relationship between pulmonary regurgitation (PR) and ventricular function. Additionally, overall patient mortality rates and the timing of surgical reinterventions, the influence of birth weight on reintervention rates, and the type of surgical repair chosen postbirth were examined.

The studies also evaluated the use of prostaglandins at birth, postnatal death rates, long-term survival, freedom from pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), and the impact of different surgical techniques on long-term outcomes. Specific outcomes included operative mortality, the success rate of valve-sparing repairs, early outcomes of new PV (NPV) repair techniques, midterm survival, freedom from reoperation, and the impact of pulmonary valve-sparing (PVS) techniques on PV function. Additionally, annular growth, the severity of the PR, the degree of pulmonary stenosis, and the growth of the PV annulus were also analyzed.

The median age at repair varied across the studies, ranging from 11 days [5] to 173 days [13]. The median weight at repair also varied across the studies from a median of 2.9 kg [5] to 9.6 kg [14]. Annavajjhala et al. [1] and a wide range of repair ages, from 8days to 108 days for TAP and 11 to 77 days for VSR.

The surgical techniques used across the analyzed studies involved several common and varied approaches, which could be attributed largely to individual patient anatomy and the surgeon’s discretion. Throughout the studies, ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure was commonly performed transatrially through the tricuspid valve, often using a patch [15,16]. For right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction, techniques included transannular patch (TAP) repair [15–17] especially where there was severe PV hypoplasia or when the PV annulus z-score was low below − 2.5; [16] or deemed too small [13]materials such as pericardial patches or monocusp homografts were used for TAP or RVOT enlargement [15,16].

Valve-sparing techniques were employed for varying degrees of PV adequacy or hypoplasia, for instance, when the PV z-score was between − 2 and − 3,15when the PV z-score was larger than − 2,17for adequately sized PVs [13], or with PV hypoplasia (z-score, − 2 to − 4 [18].

These valve-sparing methods encompassed PV commissurotomy [15–17] Hegar dilation [15]leaflet shaving [17], surgical delamination of hypertrophic valves [17]and occasionally patch augmentation of the PV anterior leaflet with materials like CorMatrix [13] or augmentation of the PV root/sinuses with autologous pericardium [16]. Some papers also reported the use of RV-PA conduits [17].

In order to have a comprehensive view on the surgical techniques valve preservation of severe cases, can be approached for patients with marked PV annulus hypoplasia (e.g., PV Z-score ≤ -4) involves incising the PV annulus and enlarging its circumference with a shallow biologic patch to achieve a target Z-score of approximately 0. The PV coaptation area is then extended through careful leaflet delamination, and the extended cusps, sometimes augmented with tiny triangles of autologous pericardium, are resuspended onto the neo-PV annulus to create a new commissure. This technique, combined with thorough transatrial and transpulmonary muscle bundle resection, aims to preserve the native pulmonary valve even in challenging anatomies, including unicommissural valves [19].

The overall surgical strategy often involved resection of infundibular muscle bundles [15,16,20]. Decisions regarding patching the infundibulum [17] or the extent of RVOT/PV intervention [13,20] were based on intraoperative assessments of RVOT dimensions and valve anatomy [17,20]. Newer techniques like neopulmonary valve (NPV) creation using living autologous right atrial appendage tissue were also noted [20]. Cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermia (e.g., mild hypothermia at 32 °C) [16] and cardioplegia [16] was standard [16,17].

Gupta et al. [16] found that VSR was associated with lower reintervention rates at 1, 5, and 8 years, with no cases of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction requiring additional surgery. Hirji et al. [14] noted no significant differences in survival rates between TAP and VSR, with comparable reintervention rates. Similarly, Kleinöder et al. [17] found no significant survival differences between repair techniques but reported that VSR was associated with the longest pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) interval. Padalino et al. [15]. showcased that PV preservation significantly reduced late adverse events (P= 0.022 for any adverse event-free survival) and TAP was associated with increased reoperation (8% vs. 4%,P= 0.029) and increased interventional procedures (15% vs. 8%,P= 0.013). Padalino et al. [15]. also conducted multivariable Cox regression analysis which showcased that a transventricular + TAP significantly increased the risk for late adverse event [HR = 4.23,P< 0.001] when compared to transatrial + TAP, and that avoiding a TAP which is transatrial + no TAP vs. transatrial + TAP was protective against postoperative complications [OR = 0.5,P= 0.007]. This findings underscore that not just the use of TAP but also the surgical approach in conjunction with TAP can influence outcomes [15].

Robinson et al. [18] demonstrated that patients undergoing VSR had significantly better baseline and post-repair pulmonary valve z-scores and main pulmonary artery (PA) growth compared to those who underwent TAP or other surgical techniques. These findings suggest that VSR promotes superior long-term valve function and growth potential.

Early repair of Tetralogy of Fallot provides significant advantages, including the prevention of ventricular hypertrophy, improved lung development, and psychological relief for families. A systematic review from 2018 suggested that performing surgery between 3 and 6 months in mild to asymptomatic cases reduces complications and improves cardiopulmonary recovery [10]. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery also advocates for early complete repair in asymptomatic patients to reduce hospital stay and adverse events [7]. Though early repair is usually recommended, Padalino et al. [15]. showcased that attempt for repair below the age of 3 months was a significant risk factor for postoperative complications [OR = 2.11 (1.21–3.71)p< 0.009] and late adverse events [HR = 5.84 (2.42–14.08)p< 0.001], however, it did not significantly affect operative mortality [OR = 2.92 (0.59–14.38)p= 0.19]. This indicated while early repair is beneficial and recommended, a very early approach carry significant risks in terms of post operative complications and late adverse events [15].

The meticulous analysis of studies comparing valve-sparing (VSR) and nonvalve-sparing (TAP) repairs highlights the benefits of VSR in TOF surgery. Evidence from Annavajjhala et al., [1]Robinson et al. (2011) [18] Kleinöder et al. (2022) [17] Schulte et al. (2023) [20] and Sen et al. (2016) [13] demonstrates that VSR leads to better outcomes, including reduced PR, improved RV function, and enhanced PV growth. Compared to TAP, VSR results in lower right ventricular (RV) dilation, improved LV GLS, and superior preserved valve function over time. Additionally, VSR was associated with a longer interval before pulmonary valve replacement. Propensity-matched analysis showcase that there is a strong corroboration pulmonary valve preservation and comparative lesser severe pulmonary regurgitation and a lower operative mortality (1% in no TAP vs. 5% in TAP group,P= 0.006) with valve preservation, moreover, valve preservation was significantly protective against postoperative complications (OR 0.5,p= 0.009) and late adverse events (P= 0.022 for any adverse event-free survival) [15].

Despite these advantages, some studies reported no significant differences between VSR and TAP in terms of reintervention and complication rates. Balasubramanya et al. [5] and Hirji et al. [14] found that while VSR improved certain outcomes, overall reintervention and survival rates were similar. In contrast, Padalino et al. did find any differences, reporting higher rates of surgical reoperation (8% vs. 4%) and interventional procedures (15% vs. 8%) in the TAP group compared to the valve-sparing group. In this case, this contrasting information favours the finding of padalino due to the larger multicenteric dataset and this data being propensity score matched. Furthermore, risk factors such as low birth weight < 3 kg, as identified by Balasubramanya et al. [5]may limit the feasibility of VSR in some patients.

While VSR is associated with reduced pulmonary regurgitation and improved right ventricular function, it is not without drawbacks. Some patients may develop residual right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, potentially requiring early reintervention. In contrast, TAP repair invariably leads to free pulmonary regurgitation, which contributes to progressive right ventricular dilation and dysfunction over time, often necessitating late pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). Although overall reintervention rates appear similar between the two techniques, the timing and indications for reintervention differ—TAP patients predominantly require delayed PVR, while VSR patients may need earlier intervention for residual obstruction. Padalino et al. adds nuance to this by showcasing that while the overall incidence of late adverse events was lower with valve preservation surgery, the reasons for reintervention might be differerent, it also showcased that the combination of a transventricular surgical approach with a TAP was associated with the worst outcomes in terms of late adverse events [HR = 4.23 (1.58–11.3)p< 0.001], this suggests that the choice of surgical access route in conjunction with RVOT management is a critical determinant of long-term morbidity [15].

As with all systematic reviews, the findings are influenced by the scope and design of the included studies, which were primarily retrospective observational studies with varying follow-up durations and institutional practices. In retrospective studies, selection bias is an inherent challenge, as surgical decisions are based on preoperative patient characteristics. However, we minimized bias by including comparative studies that drew conclusions from appropriately selected patient groups.

Additionally, while this review highlights key trends favoring VSR, variability across studies—including differences in surgical techniques, patient populations, and outcome measures—should be considered when interpreting the results. Although high-quality prospective trials remain limited, the included studies underwent standardized quality appraisal to ensure methodological rigor.

Future research should focus on well-designed prospective studies and multi-center trials with standardized reporting to further clarify long-term outcomes, particularly regarding valve durability, reintervention rates, and aproper ventricular function. Refining patient selection criteria through large-scale data analysis may also help optimize surgical decision-making in TOF repair. Establishing uniform definitions of key outcomes and ensuring more extended follow-up periods will also contribute to greater consistency and applicability of findings.

Valve Sparing Repair (VSR) is often considered surgically superior for the repair of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) whenever it is feasible, as it is consistently associated with improved right ventricular function, reduced pulmonary regurgitation, and enhanced pulmonary valve growth due to preservation of the valve, also avoiding a TAP, particularly when a transventricular approach is used, is paramount for optimizing for the best outcomes, careful patient selection is paramount, and the decision between VSR and Transannular Patch (TAP) should be informed by individual anatomical and clinical factors. Age < 3 months is a significant risk factor for complications and late adverse events, although not for operative mortality, this contributes to the nuances of careful patient selection, suggesting that factors beyond just annular size, such as patient maturity and weight, play a role. This systematic review provides a foundation for future research aimed at refining surgical strategies and enhancing long-term outcomes for patients undergoing TOF repair.

Across all included studies, VSR was consistently associated with better RV function, lower PR rates, superior PV growth, and significantly lower operative mortality, lower late adverse events, and lower rates of both surgical and catheter-based reinterventions in the valve-sparing group compared to the TAP group. Balasubramanya et al. [5] and Hirji et al. [14] reported that low birth weight was a significant risk factor for VSR candidacy, highlighting the importance of patient selection criteria. Kleinöder et al. [17] found that VSR had significantly larger pulmonary valve z-scores compared to TAP (p< 0.001), supporting its role in preserving native valve function.

In this systematic review, we meticulously analyzed the evidence to determine which of the repair VSR offers significant advantages over TAP in TOF repair, particularly in reducing PR, enhancing PV growth, and improving RV function. However, the choice of surgical technique should consider individual patient characteristics, including birth weight and anatomical suitability. The further nuance is that it is not merely about finding the surgical approach but also whether to decide to use TAP (surgical approach + TAP strategy) which may influence the long-term outcomes. Further long-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings and refine patient selection criteria for optimal surgical outcomes.
