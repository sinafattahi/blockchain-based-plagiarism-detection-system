Vulvar melanoma (VM) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with a high metastatic potential. We present the case of an 82-year-old woman who initially presented with vaginal bleeding and was diagnosed with VM with lymph node involvement. Despite surgical and palliative interventions, she later developed brain, nodal, and pancreatic metastases. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) confirmed pancreatic metastasis through immunohistochemistry. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreatic metastasis from VM diagnosed by EUS-FNB. This case highlights the importance of EUS-FNB in diagnosing metastatic lesions in unusual locations.

An 82-year-old White woman presented with progressively worsening vaginal bleeding. She sought medical assistance 2 years after symptom onset, at which time a solid, polypoid lesion was identified on the left inferior vaginal wall. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 1.3 cm lesion accompanied by bilateral iliac lymphadenopathy.

The patient underwent uterine curettage, lesion resection, cervical conization, partial vulvectomy, and inguinal excisional LN biopsy, with histopathological analysis confirming VM with LN involvement. Despite these interventions, residual lesion was detected. Owing to her poor clinical status and multiple comorbidities, including heart failure and obesity, a palliative approach with radiotherapy and lymphadenectomy was chosen.

Two years later, during the follow-up, she presented with a brain lesion, further nodal involvement, and a pancreatic mass at CT (Figures1A and1B). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a 7.6 × 7.1 cm hypoechoic mass in the pancreas, with splenic artery involvement (Figures2A and2B). An EUS-guided puncture was performed using a 22 G needle (FNB—Medi-globe, Rohrdorf, Germany) with 2 passes, each involving 20 to-and-fro movements with fanning method. The first pass used the slow-pull technique, while the second pass used the wet suction technique with 10 mL of negative pressure, without ROSE (rapid on-site evaluation). Positive immunohistochemical staining for HMB-45 (Figure3A) and Melan-A (Figure3B) confirmed the metastasis of VM. Since her condition deteriorated, a multidisciplinary team recommended exclusive palliative care. The patient died at home 3 months later.

In patients with widespread metastatic disease, including brain and pancreatic lesions, establishing the histological origin of a pancreatic mass remains clinically relevant, even in a palliative setting. A confirmed diagnosis of metastatic melanoma—rather than primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma—may influence treatment decisions, prognostic expectations, and patient counseling. Although surgical resection is typically not indicated, systemic therapy options, such as immunotherapy or targeted agents, vary significantly based on tumor origin and molecular profile. Furthermore, accurate histological classification supports appropriate palliative strategies, potentially minimizing unnecessary interventions and optimizing quality of life.

VM is an uncommon and aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Clinicians should consider prioritizing FNB over FNA when evaluating pancreatic masses, especially in patients with known malignancies, where obtaining adequate tissue for immunohistochemistry is critical to confirm secondary tumors and guide patient management, especially in the precision oncology era.
