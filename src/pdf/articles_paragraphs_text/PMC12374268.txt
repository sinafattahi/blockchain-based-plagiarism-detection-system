Severe spinal deformities require surgical intervention, with preoperative traction commonly used to improve spinal flexibility and surgical safety. However, the impact of traction on bone mineral density (BMD) and its relationship with correction outcomes remains poorly understood.

This retrospective study analyzed patients with severe spinal deformities who underwent halo-pelvic traction before surgical correction. Key parameters including Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis (TK), height, and BMD were measured before and after traction. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlation analysis were performed to assess treatment effects and relationships between variables.

Twenty-six patients (10 males, 16 females; mean age 25.31 ± 7.52 years) underwent traction for an average of 3.88 ± 1.31 months. Traction significantly improved spinal parameters: Cobb angle decreased by 37.56 ± 7.45° (P< 0.001), thoracic kyphosis reduced by 35.72 ± 13.32° (P< 0.001), and height increased by 10.2 ± 3.36 cm (P< 0.001). However, BMD decreased significantly by 17.90 ± 15.58 (P< 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between BMD loss and Cobb angle correction(r= 0.730) and Thoracic kyphosis correction(r= 0.683), indicating greater correction was associated with more pronounced BMD reduction.

While preoperative traction effectively corrects severe spinal deformities and improves flexibility, it significantly decreases BMD. The strong correlation between correction effectiveness and bone loss highlights the need for careful monitoring of bone quality during traction, especially in high-risk patients. Further research is needed to optimize traction protocols and prevent bone loss.

Severe spine deformities not only impact appearance but can also adversely affect patients’ cardiopulmonary function and nervous system, potentially leading to a significant decline in quality of life [1,2]. Non-surgical interventions, such as bracing, physical therapy, and posture training, are generally attempted in the early stages; however, surgical intervention is necessary if the deformity is severe or progressive.

Among the various surgical strategies, improving spine flexibility and correctability preoperatively to enhance the safety and effectiveness of surgery has become a key focus in clinical practice [3,4]. Common preoperative traction methods include Halo-pelvic traction, Halo-femoral traction, and other traction devices [5]. Halo-pelvic traction represents a well-established preoperative intervention that applies controlled distraction forces to the spine through a rigid connection between skull pins and pelvic screws. The mechanism of action involves gradual stretching of contracted soft tissues, ligaments, and joint capsules, while simultaneously decompressing neural structures and improving spinal alignment. This technique is particularly valuable for patients with severe rigid deformities (Cobb angle > 90° in scoliosis or > 70° in kyphosis) where conventional surgical approaches alone may pose significant risks due to limited spinal flexibility. The traction system allows for progressive correction over weeks to months, enabling tissue adaptation and reducing the magnitude of acute correction required during definitive surgery. Modern protocols typically involve incremental increases in distraction (0.5–1.0 cm daily) under careful neurological monitoring, with the goal of achieving 30–50% deformity correction before surgical intervention [6,7]. While the benefits of preoperative traction in terms of deformity correction and surgical safety are well-documented, the potential adverse effects on bone metabolism and mineral density warrant comprehensive investigation to optimize treatment protocols.

The consort patient selection is shown in Fig.1.The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion Criteria: [1] Main coronal Cobb angle more than 90 in scoliosis or Cobb angle more than 70 in kyphosis; [2] the kyphosis or scoliosis was rigid (the change of Cobb angle in bending or lateral radiograph less than 30%) [2]Complete preoperative and postoperative imaging studies and bone mineral density (BMD) measurement data; [3]Received at least 1 months of traction therapy with relatively stable traction methods and forces; [4]Signed informed consent and voluntarily participated in the study. Exclusion Criteria: [1]Severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction or other systemic diseases rendering the patient unable to tolerate surgery; [2]Concomitant acute infection or inflammation causing spine instability; [3]Recent use of medications significantly affecting bone metabolism (such as high-dose steroids, specific anti-osteoporosis drugs, etc.); [4]Incomplete imaging and BMD data, rendering effective measurement impossible. This study included a total of 26 patients, comprising 10 males and 16 females, with an average age of 25.31 ± 7.52 years. All patients underwent surgical correction for spine deformity (primarily congenital or idiopathic deformities) at our hospital and completed traction therapy before surgery.

Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in a supine position. Six to eight iliac screws, each 4.5 mm in diameter, were inserted into both iliac bones to a depth of 3–5 cm. Subsequently, six to eight skull pins were placed on the skull. The iliac screws and skull pins were then covered with sterile dressings.

Follow-up CT scans of the head and pelvis were conducted to confirm the accurate placement of the iliac screws and skull pins. Once verified, telescoping rods were used to connect the pelvic and skull rings. The initial traction position was recorded, and the traction nuts were adjusted daily thereafter, with an increment of 0.5 cm per day. If the patient experienced significant pain or neurological symptoms, traction was temporarily suspended, and symptomatic treatment was administered. Once the symptoms subsided, traction was resumed. The skin around the screw and pin sites was dressed every one or two days, as needed.

[1]Cobb Angle: Measured using standard full-length anteroposterior and lateral X-ray films of the spine. For patients with thoracolumbar or thoracic deformities, the topmost and bottommost vertebral endplate lines of the main curve are selected for measurement. Measurements are taken by two independent orthopedic surgeons and averaged to reduce error.

[2]Thoracic Kyphosis (TK): The kyphotic kyphosis is measured using the Cobb method by identifying the upper and lower end vertebrae with the greatest inclination of their endplates within the kyphotic curve on a lateral X-ray. Lines are drawn along the superior endplate of the upper end vertebra and the inferior endplate of the lower end vertebra. Perpendicular lines are then constructed from these reference lines, and the angle formed at their intersection is measured to determine the kyphotic Cobb angle.

[3] BMD measurement: The Siemens 16-slice spiral CT (SOMATOM EMOTION) was used to scan the lumbar vertebrae L2 to L4 of the patient. The examinee was positioned in a supine posture, with a fixed standard phantom and a cushion placed vertically under the waist along the longitudinal axis of the body. Synchronous scanning was performed on both the examinee and the phantom. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the central trabecular bone portion of the L1, L2, and L3 vertebral bodies, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) was then measured in each ROI, and the results were averaged across the three vertebrae. Care was taken to avoid including the cortical bone of the vertebral bodies within the ROIs.

[3]Parameters: (i)Cobb correction rate = 100*(Pre Cobb – Post Cobb)/Pre Cobb; (ii)TK correction rate = 100*(Pre TK – Post TK)/Pre TK; (iii)△Cobb = Pre Cobb – Post Cobb; (iv)△TK = Pre TK – Post TK; (v)△BMD = Pre BMD – Post BMD; (vi)△Height = Pre height – Post height.

Data are analyzed using SPSS software, including descriptive statistics to delineate the fundamental characteristics of enrolled patients (age, gender, height, etiology, etc.). Paired t-test is applied to compare variations in Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis angle (TK), height, and bone mineral density (BMD) before and after traction. Correlation analysis using Pearson correlation coefficients is applied to assess the relationship between correction rate and preoperative parameters (Cobb angle, TK, height, BMD, etc.), with a significance level ofP< 0.05 considered statistically significant.

This study included 26 patients (10 males and 16 females) with an average age of 25.31 ± 7.52 years. The average traction time is 3.88 ± 1.31 m. The comparison of patient height, thoracic kyphosis angle (TK), Cobb angle, and bone mineral density (BMD) before and after traction is presented in Table1.

[1]Height Increased from 137.37 ± 10.37 cm before traction to 147.56 ± 9.74 cm after traction, with a mean difference of 10.2 ± 3.36 cm (P< 0.001), shown in Fig.2. (2) Thoracic Kyphosis (TK) decreased from 128.92 ± 26.13° before traction to 93.20 ± 27.17° after traction, with a mean reduction of 35.72 ± 13.32° (P< 0.001), shown in Fig.3. (3) Cobb Angle decreased from 141.96 ± 20.15° before traction to 104.41 ± 17.29° after traction, with a mean reduction of 37.56 ± 7.45° (P< 0.001), shown in Fig.4(4) BMD decreased from 121.92 ± 27.17 before traction to 104.02 ± 35.22 after traction, with a mean reduction of 17.90 ± 15.58 (P< 0.001), shown in Fig.5.

This study conducted a Pearson correlation analysis and found that there are strong positive correlations between ΔBMD and ΔCobb, ΔTK. In other words, the better the correction effect achieved through traction (i.e., the more significant the improvements in Cobb angle and TK), the more pronounced the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), shown in Table3. The scatter plot showing the correlation between ΔBMD and ΔCobb is shown in Fig.6. Figure7presents the correlation between ΔBMD and ΔTK.

Table4summarizes pearson correlation between traction time and ΔBMD, ΔCobb and ΔTK. The scatter plot Fig.8shows correlation between traction time with ΔBMD (Fig.8A), ΔCobb(Fig.8B) and ΔTK (Fig.8C).

Halo-pelvic traction significantly corrected spine deformities. Fig.9A and B are typical patients in our study. Specifically, the Cobb angle, a primary indicator of scoliosis severity, decreased by an average of 37.56°, while the thoracic kyphosis angle decreased by 35.72°. Both reductions were statistically significant (P< 0.001). These findings align with previous research suggesting that traction enhances spine flexibility, especially in patients with severe or rigid deformities [11,12]. Preoperative traction is recognized for its ability to “release” the spine, thereby improving its correctability during surgery and enhancing surgical safety and efficacy [13]. The substantial reduction in the Cobb angle underscores the crucial role of traction in preparing patients for surgery by mitigating deformity severity and optimizing surgical outcomes [14]. Furthermore, traction led to a significant increase in patient height (10.2 ± 3.36 cm), reinforcing the beneficial effects of traction on spine flexibility. This height increase suggests that traction may aid in restoring spine alignment, ultimately contributing to more favorable postoperative results. The flexibility of patients with spine deformities can be assessed not only through indirect evaluation of Cobb angle and TK changes before and after traction, but also through objective, quantitative assessment methods such as sit-to-stand transition tests and dynamic flexion-extension X-ray imaging. In future studies, these techniques will help provide a more comprehensive preoperative prediction of spinal correctability and guide individualized traction protocols [15,16].

A noteworthy finding of the study was the decrease in BMD following traction. The average BMD decreased by 17.90 ± 15.58 after traction, with a significant difference (P< 0.001). BMD is a critical factor in spine surgery, as reduced BMD increases the risk of complications like screw loosening, breakage, and fractures [10,17]. The observed BMD decrease implies that while traction improves spine deformity correction, it may simultaneously compromise bone integrity.

A strong positive correlation was evident between changes in BMD (ΔBMD) and improvements in the Cobb angle (ΔCobb), thoracic kyphosis (ΔTK). This correlation suggests that greater spine correction achieved through traction is associated with more significant BMD loss. Spine surgeons must strike a balance between the benefits of spine deformity correction and the potential risks posed by decreased BMD, especially in patients at high risk for osteoporosis or other bone-related conditions.

The phenomenon of greater bone mineral density (BMD) loss with better spinal correction, especially during preoperative traction or other corrective measures, can be explained through several mechanisms: [1] Relationship Between Traction Load and Bone Density: Traction therapy requires continuous force to be applied to the spine to stretch and realign its structure. This process can create significant mechanical load on the vertebral bones. If the traction force is too high or the duration too long, it may cause microstructural changes in the bones due to excessive stress. When bones are subjected to excessive pulling or pressure, bone resorption, or a decrease in bone density, can occur. Since traction is a physical intervention, it may temporarily have a negative effect on bone quality [2,18,19]. Inverse Relationship Between Correction Degree and Bone Density: During spinal deformity correction, the greater the degree of correction, especially when a large range of correction is involved, the more significant the structural changes to the spine. These changes can affect the surrounding bones. This may include microfractures of the bone, stretching of ligaments, etc., which can activate the bone resorption process, leading to a decrease in bone density. In patients who already have osteoporosis or weaker bones, larger adjustments during spinal correction may exacerbate the brittleness of the bone [20,21].

Furthermore, additional Pearson correlation analysis revealed no significant correlations between traction duration and Cobb angle improvement, thoracic kyphosis improvement, or bone mineral density changes. In other words, although all patients received continuous Halo-Pelvic traction for at least 1 month, the duration of traction itself does not further influence the magnitude of deformity correction or bone loss. This finding is consistent with previous research conclusions: traction can significantly improve spinal flexibility and deformity within the initial 4–6 weeks, while continued extension of traction duration provides limited marginal benefit for deformity release or bone quality change [22–24]. Therefore, in clinical practice, greater attention should be focused on timely transition to definitive surgery and strengthened bone quality protection strategies, rather than simply prolonging the traction period.

The study findings indicate that preoperative traction is effective in correcting spine deformities but may lead to reduced BMD, increasing the risk of postoperative complications. Surgeons should carefully consider the duration and intensity of traction, especially in patients with low BMD or osteoporosis, and closely monitor bone quality throughout the process. Future research is needed to establish safe thresholds for traction in relation to BMD changes and to identify strategies for mitigating bone loss during traction. Potential interventions include the use of bone-strengthening medications, such as bisphosphonates, or calcium and vitamin D supplementation, to maintain bone health during the preoperative period [25,26].

This study has some limitations, including a relatively small sample size of 26 patients and a retrospective design. Larger prospective studies with extended follow-up periods are necessary to gain a better understanding of the long-term effects of traction on spine deformity correction and BMD. Additionally, future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying BMD loss during traction and investigating potential preventive measures.

Preoperative traction is an effective approach for correcting spine deformities in patients with severe deformities. It significantly enhances spine flexibility, as demonstrated by reductions in the Cobb angle and thoracic kyphosis, and increases patient height. However, traction may also lead to a significant decrease in BMD, raising concerns about bone quality and the risk of postoperative complications. The strong correlation between spine correction and BMD reduction highlights the need for caution when using prolonged traction in patients with low BMD. Further research is required to determine the optimal duration and intensity of traction and to develop strategies for minimizing its negative impact on bone health.
