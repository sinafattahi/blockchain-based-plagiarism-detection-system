The unique structural configuration of amorphous nanomaterials, characterized by their disordered atomic arrangements, highly exposed active sites, and isotropic homogeneity, enables exceptional catalytic performance that bridges the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, an amorphous CuPd catalyst was fabricated through incorporating Cu ions into the disordered Pd lattice, creating an amorphous monolayer architecture with engineered hydrogen transport pathways. The precisely modulated atomic/electronic configuration optimizes the adsorption configuration and bonding strength between substrate/intermediates and catalysts surfaces. The amorphous catalyst achieves 96.2% selectivity at 99.1% conversion under mild conditions, with a time of flight of 6004 hour−1. These results demonstrate that amorphous architectures, with their disordered atomic arrangements, uniformly distributed active sites, and tunable adsorption energetics, establish a generalized design framework for high-performance catalysts, achieving superior selectivity and activity compared to crystalline systems.

Amorphous monolayer CuPd catalyst with disordered structure achieves 96.2% selectivity at 99.1% conversion in semihydrogenation.

Styrene, one of the most produced bulk chemicals in modern industry, finds extensive applications across various fields (1,2). However, petroleum-derived styrene contains trace phenylacetylene impurities, which adversely affect subsequent styrene polymerization processes and may even lead to catalyst deactivation (3,4). Consequently, the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to pure styrene represents a critical technology for enhancing product quality and reducing production costs (5). Palladium (Pd) effectively activates hydrogen due to its unique 4d10valence electron arrangement, enabling semihydrogenation reactions to proceed even under ambient conditions (6,7). However, the robust adsorption of styrene on Pd surfaces competes with hydrogen activation at adjacent metallic sites, which may induce overhydrogenation (8,9). Thus, there is an urgent need to engineer the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pd for the development of catalysts that are highly selective and active in phenylacetylene semihydrogenation.

Unlike conventional crystalline heterogeneous catalysts, which typically feature complex and multiple active sites arising from various exposed facets and edges, the amorphous catalysts with isotropic characteristics have high-density, homogeneously distributed catalytic active sites (10,11). Due to their unique structural features, amorphous nanomaterials demonstrate exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity. The long-range disordered atomic arrangement generates abundant active sites (12–14), while their flexible atomic structure facilitates in situ transformation into active phases during catalysis and enables low-activation-energy reaction pathways (15,16). The intrinsic long-range disorder of amorphous materials effectively eliminates the inherent heterogeneous active sites found in crystalline catalysts, generating isotropic catalytic environments with uniform active centers that resolve selectivity constraints associated with multisite variations (17–22). The isotropic nature and tunable electronic states of amorphous nanomaterials enable precise regulation of the intermediate adsorption-desorption equilibrium (23–25). These attributes, combined with nanoscale engineering, make amorphous nanomaterials highly promising for catalytic applications such as styrene semihydrogenation.

Inspired by the amorphous architecture, we synthesized atomically thin CuPd nanosheets (a-CuPd) through a ligand-confined in situ amorphization strategy. The resulting a-CuPd features a monolayer configuration with a defined thickness of 0.34 nm. This approach enabled the incorporation and stabilization of Cu ions within the disordered structure, effectively leveraging the unique properties of amorphous systems to control material electronic states and composition. The introduction of Cu ions optimized the electronic structure of Pd and established hydrogen spillover pathways. Moreover, compared with the crystalline counterpart, the adsorption configuration and bonding strength between the substrate/intermediates and the amorphous CuPd (a-CuPd) catalytic surfaces is optimized, which tailors the adsorption energy and catalytic barriers to favor the hydrogenation of alkynes and desorption of olefins at Cu sites. The amorphous catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in styrene semihydrogenation, achieving 96.2% selectivity and 99.1% conversion under mild conditions. This work establishes a paradigm for designing heterogeneous catalysts of atomic-level thin by exploiting the structural isotropy and tunable adsorption properties unique to amorphous systems.

In this work, a ligand-assisted in situ amorphization strategy is proposed to prepare atomically thin amorphous CuPd nanosheets (a-CuPd). Initially, lamellar Cu2O-oleic acid composites consisting of alternating oleic acid ligand and atomically thin Cu2O layers were used as precursor (fig. S1) (26). Under the confinement of the oleic acid ligand layer, in situ oxidation of Cu+with Pd2+was conducted, triggering a confined redox reaction that induced atomic rearrangement and disrupted the crystalline structure. This process was accompanied with the collapse of lamellar structure, resulting in the formation the atomically thin amorphous structure (Fig. 1A). Time-dependent x-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles further validate the ligand-assisted in situ amorphization process (fig. S2). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm the morphology of the nanosheets, which exhibit an average lateral size of ~3 μm (Fig. 1B). The selected area electron diffraction pattern displays a halo structure, indicating an amorphous phase, which is consistent with the XRD results (fig. S3). The high-resolution TEM images reiterate the disordered structure of the samples (Fig. 1C). Energy-dispersive spectrometry mapping (Fig. 1E) confirms the uniform distribution of Cu and Pd elements in the nanosheets. The molar ratio of Cu/Pd was ~3:1, consistent with the inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (MS) results (table S1). To evaluate the thickness of bare a-CuPd layer, the ligands were removed by calcinating oleic acid–coordinated a-CuPd on silica wafer in a vacuum oven at 300°C, leading to the formation of silica wafer–supported CuPd nanosheets. The average thickness characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is ~0.34 nm (Fig. 1D). Given the atomic radii of Pd (0.137 nm) and Cu (0.128 nm), this thickness corresponds to a single atomic layer (27). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra confirm the presence of oleic acid as the surface ligand on a-CuPd (fig. S4). The corresponding ligand-to-metal molar ratio is 0.979 determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis (fig. S5). The existence of oleic acid ligands not only provides a confinement space for in situ amorphization during the synthesis process but also contributes to the stabilization of the amorphous and ultrathin two-dimensional structure.

To investigate the electronic structure and coordination environment of a-CuPd, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were carried out. Crystalline CuPd nanosheets (c-CuPd) with a comparable Cu/Pd ratio were synthesized as reference (28) (detailed characterization of crystalline CuPd is shown in figs. S6 and S7). A pair of distinct shake-up satellites originating from the unfilled 3dorbitals can be observed in the XPS Cu 2pspectra of a-CuPd, indicating the +2 valence of Cu species. In contrast, the Cu element in c-CuPd maintains a metallic nature (Fig. 2A), confirmed by the appearance of peak around 919.2 eV in the CuL3M45M45Auger spectrum (fig. S8) (29–31). The electronic discrepancy of incorporated Cu could substantially regulate the electronic states of Pd. As depicted inFig. 2B, the binding energy of Pd 3d5/2in a-CuPd was at 336.3 eV, which is 0.6 eV higher than that of c-CuPd, indicating an electron-deficient state arising from the electron transfer from Pd to Cu(II) atoms in the amorphous structure.

XAS is a powerful tool for the structural analysis of disordered materials (32,33). TheK-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of Cu arising from the 1s-4porbital transition can effectively distinguish different valence states. Both the absorption edge and white-line intensity of a-CuPd are similar to those of CuO, proving the +2 valence state (Fig. 2C), in agreement with XPS results (34,35). Conversely, the absorption edge of c-CuPd is located close to the Cu foil, indicating a metallic state. To analyze the local coordination geometry, Fourier transform of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) was performed (fig. S9 and table S2). As shown inFig. 2D, the FT-EXAFS spectra of a-CuPd show a distinct peak at ∼1.92 Å, corresponding to the first shell of Cu–O bond arising from the coordination of carboxylic acid. The observed peak at 2.72 Å can be assigned to the Cu–Pd bond, while the shoulder at 2.21 Å corresponds to the Cu–Cu bond. Notably, the Cu–Cu bond length in a-CuPd is 0.03 Å shorter than that in c-CuPd, indicating lattice distortion in the amorphous structure. The coordination number of Cu element in a-CuPd is substantially reduced by 3.6 in comparison to that in the crystalline counterpart, consistent with the amorphous and ultrathin structure. The wavelet transform EXAFS (WT-EXAFS) exhibits high resolution at both wave vectorkand bond lengthRspaces, providing clearer evidence of the complex coordinate structure. In the WT-EXAFS spectra of Cu, the strong oscillations in the high and lowkvalues suggest the coexistence of Cu–Cu and Cu–O bonds (Fig. 2E). These results, in combination with the FTIR analysis (fig. S4), reiterate the existence of the oleic acid ligand in the system.

The absorption thresholds in PdK-edge XANES in a-CuPd and c-CuPd are close to the absorption thresholds of the Pd foils (Fig. 2F), indicating a metallic nature. Notably, a discernible charge transfer from Pd to Cu is evident, with a slightly lower absorption threshold observed in a-CuPd compared to c-CuPd. This charge transfer is corroborated by a 0.6 eV blue shift observed in the XPS spectra, indicating an electron-deficient state of Pd in a-CuPd. The EXAFS results (Fig. 2, G and H, and table S3) prove the coexistence of Pd–Pd and Pd–Cu bonding. The absence of Pd–O bonding in the WT-EXAFS indicates that the oleic acid is coordinated exclusively with Cu atoms, rather than Pd. In addition to the experimental characterization, we carried out first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at a temperature of 303 K for a total simulation time of 10 ps. The system’s potential energy profile does not show any obvious jump or drift, indicating that the atomically thin amorphous structure is thermally stable at the considered temperature (fig. S10). These result demonstrate that Cu(II) is successfully incorporated into the disordered structure of Pd monolayer nanosheets, resulting in an electronic structure distinct from crystalline system, which could contribute to the construction of a hydrogen overflow pathway.

Based on the structural characteristics of our amorphous catalysts, a feasible solution is provided to solve the problem of styrene purification in industry. In our experiments, the catalytic hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was evaluated at ambient temperature and pressure with c-CuPd as the counterpart (Fig. 3A), whereas the Cu₂O precursor failed to hydrogenate phenylacetylene under identical conditions (fig. S11). The catalytic behavior of both a-CuPd and c-CuPd was monitored through time-dependent concentration of phenylacetylene and various products, as illustrated inFig. 3 (B and C). Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to monitor the reaction process. The as-prepared a-CuPd catalysts exhibits ultrahigh selectivity toward styrene (>96.2%) throughout the reaction, achieving 99.1% conversion at 240 min. Negligible overhydrogenation product was observed with prolonged reaction time to 360 min, and high purity styrene was obtained. In comparison, the selectivity of the c-CuPd decreases linearly with increasing reaction time. In particular, the selectivity for styrene was 0% after 240 min, exhibiting typical overhydrogenation toward phenylethane, such overhydrogenation also occurring in commercial Pd/C of equivalent mass (fig. S12). In addition, a-CuPd exhibits an impressive time-of-flight (TOF) value as high as 6004 hour−1, indicative of high catalytic activity. It selectively hydrogenated phenylacetylene in a mixture of styrene and phenylacetylene, showcasing strong potential for practical applications (fig. S13). The study investigated the catalytic performance at different Pd/Cu ratios, and the results show that the activity for semihydrogenated phenylacetylene increases substantially with higher Pd/Cu ratios, while the selectivity remained largely unaffected (table S4). Reusability and stability tests revealed that the a-CuPd catalyst retained excellent performance after five cycles, maintaining 97.6% selectivity and 92.5% conversion (fig. S14). TEM imaging further demonstrates the robust nanosheet structure after catalytic cycling, and XPS confirms that Cu2+is stabilized in the structure (figs. S15 and S16), affirming the stability of the atomically thin amorphous structure during catalytic hydrogenation process. To evaluate the universality of the a-CuPd catalyst for selective semihydrogenation of alkynes, a series of acetylene derivatives with various functional groups were assessed. As shown inFig. 3D, the a-CuPd exhibits superior catalytic performance with high activity and high selectivity toward several alkynes with fluorine, bromine, nitro, and methyl groups.

The selective semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene is highly dependent on the intrinsic pathways of H2activation and the interaction between unsaturated groups with the catalytic metal surfaces. Density functional theory calculations were further carried out to gain insights into the catalytic mechanism of the a-CuPd catalyst (figs. S17 and S18).Figure 4Areports the Gibbs free energy profiles detailing the semihydrogenation pathway on both a-CuPd and c-CuPd, showcasing transition states (TSs). The barrier for this rate-determining step (TS1) is calculated to be 0.60 eV for c-CuPd, which is lower than the barrier observed for a-CuPd (0.79 eV). However, the elevated hydrogenation rate observed in c-CuPd catalysis results in a notably lower energy barrier (TS3, 0.75 eV) for further hydrogenation of styrene. This energy barrier is substantially lower than the desorption energy of styrene from the catalyst (1.93 eV). Therefore, styrene on c-CuPd is more prone to overhydrogenation to produce phenylethane than desorption to obtain the target product styrene. In contrast, on a-CuPd, the energy barrier (TS3) for the hydrogenation of styrene is 0.87 eV, which is higher than its desorption energy (0.55 eV). This trend indicates that, while a-CuPd retains the robust hydrogenation rate observed in c-CuPd, it overcomes the excessive styrene adsorption issue, resulting in improved hydrogenation selectivity.

(E) The reaction coordinate of the hydrogen atom, from dissociation to transfer around the styrene adsorption site.

The interaction between the oleic acid and monolayer a-CuPd catalysts was further investigated. To further identify the adsorption sites of oleic acid on the surface, the adsorption energies at Cu and Pd sites were calculated. Results showed lower adsorption energy on Cu sites (−1.04 eV) than on Pd sites (−0.77 eV), indicating stronger surface interaction and enhanced thermodynamic stability of the adsorption configuration at Cu active centers. The corresponding Bader’s charge analysis shows that the surface coordination of oleic acid can induce a substantial charge transfer from Cu to the ligands (Fig. 4B), which contributes to the stabilization of positive Cu ions in the disordered structure. It could be noted that the positive Cu ions form robust bonding with substrates, intermediates, and products across the catalytic process, which is decisive for the catalytic pathway. This behavior contrasts with typical crystalline CuPd catalysts, where the incorporation of metallic Cu atoms simply acts to dilute the Pd ensembles regulating the system’s electronic structure while hardly interacting with reaction intermediates (Fig. 4Aand figs. S19 and S20) (36,37). Also, we deduced that competition between styrene and oleic acid for adsorption sites on the surface of a-CuPd could presumably reduce the desorption energy of styrene.

The lowered desorption energy of a-CuPd can be revealed by the crystal orbital overlap population (COHP) analysis (36,38). COHP analysis provides the electronic details of the interaction between styrene and a-CuPd and c-CuPd, further quantifying the bonding strength through the integral of COHP (iCOHP) up to the Fermi level (Fig. 4, C and D). The positive Cu ions in a-CuPd can form robust bonding with styrene, exhibiting substantially different adsorption configurations from c-CuPd. The calculated absolute −iCOHP of 0.30 eV for Cu-C in a-CuPd is lower than the 0.48 eV value for Pd-C in c-CuPd. This indicates that the Cu–C bond in the amorphous structure is relative weaker than Pd-C bonds in the crystalline counterpart. As a result, the adsorption of styrene on a-CuPd is effectively weakened by the presence of positive Cu ions, eventually leading to an enhancement in its semihydrogenation selectivity.

The hydrogenation of phenylacetylene proceeds through a Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, where a gradual increase in saturation occurs through addition of single H atoms in sequence according to a C8H7, C8H8, C8H9, and C8H10series (39–41). Consequently, H adsorption, activation, and transport substantially influence the catalytic process. We accordingly calculated the hydrogen dissociation and transport ability of the catalysts.Figure 4Eillustrates the hydrogen adsorption energy and transport energy barrier on the catalysts’ surface. The hydrogen adsorption energy on a-CuPd (−0.78 eV) is substantially more negative than on c-CuPd (−0.27 eV) due to the positive valence of Cu in the former system. Moreover, the energy barrier for hydrogen transfer on a-CuPd is 0.14 eV, 30% lower than on c-CuPd (0.2 eV). Therefore, the incorporation of Cu cations facilitates the activation and spillover of active H species, fostering the accumulation of activated H around Cu centers and ultimately accelerating hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (fig. S21).

We have developed a ligand-assisted in situ amorphization strategy to synthesize amorphous monolayer CuPd nanosheets for semihydrogenation catalysis. The long-range disordered nature of amorphous structures eliminates the heterogeneous active sites inherent to crystalline catalysts, thereby creating isotropic and homogeneous catalytic centers that overcome the selectivity limitations caused by multiple active site types. Within the disordered Pd lattice, Cu ions are stabilized as isolated adsorption centers through structural confinement. This atomic arrangement modulates substrate/catalyst interfacial interactions by optimizing both the adsorption geometry and bonding strength of intermediates, while the structural isotropy of the amorphous matrix facilitates hydrogen spillover across uniformly distributed active sites. The synergistic interplay between Cu adsorption centers and the amorphous Pd framework tailors hydrogen dissociation energetics and reduces catalytic barriers, enabling selective alkyne hydrogenation while promoting rapid olefin desorption. The amorphous catalyst exhibits a remarkable catalytic selectivity (>96.2%) toward styrene with a superb TOF value up to 6004 hour−1under mild reaction conditions. These insights and the associated newly established relationships between amorphous structure, ligand modifier, separated adsorption centers, and catalytic properties contribute to deeper understanding of selectivity regulation in semihydrogenation of alkynes, opening promising avenues to the fabrication of atomic-scale catalysts with enhanced performance.

Initially, the deionized water used in the reaction underwent boiling and nitrogen passivation for 30 min. Then, 200 ml of deionized water was added into a water bath set at 45°C. The solution was magnetically stirred until 11.5 g of sodium oleate was completely dispersed. Then, 1.06 g of CuCl was added to 300 ml of deionized water and stirred carefully. The aqueous solution of CuCl was mixed with dissolved sodium oleate and stirred for 5 min. Next, 10 g of hexamethylenetetramine was added and stirred for another 5 min. Then, 1.3 ml of hydrazine hydrate was added drop by drop into the solution. The mixture was then sealed, ventilated with nitrogen, and stirred for 20 min. Afterward, the solution was transferred to an oil bath equipped with a magnetic stirrer and heated to 95°C for 6 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample is removed and washed three times alternately with water and ethanol. The samples are heated at 60°C for an additional 6 hours. The samples were then transferred to a freeze dryer for 24 hours to obtain the precursor material.

Palladium chloride (20 mg) was dissolved in a solution containing octadecene with oleylamine at 135°C and stirred until it was a light-yellow transparent solution. As-prepared Cu2O nanosheets (25 mg) were dispersed in 2 ml of ethanol solution and sonicated for 1 hour. The dispersion was added to palladium chloride solution and stirred for 3.5 hours. The final product was collected through centrifugation and washed three times with ethanol.

As previously reported in the literature, 10 mg of Na2PdCl4, 9 mg of CuCl2·2H2O, and 45 mg of W(CO)6were dissolved in 5 ml of acetic acid and 5 ml ofN,N′-dimethylformamide. The mixture solution was stirred and sonicated for at least 10 min. Then, the resulting suspension was transferred into an oil bath and heated at 140°C for 120 min. The as-obtained black colloidal products were centrifuged and washed with ethanol several times and lastly dispersed in ethanol.

The morphology of the products was investigated by TEM (FEI Titan Themis G3). The powder XRD of the samples was acquired using the Rigaku Rotaflex Dmax 2200 diffractometer with Cu Kαradiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The XPS spectra and Anger spectra of the samples were measured to evaluate valence band using the Thermo ESCALAB XI+. The thickness of the sample was measured by AFM (Dimension Icon). The TGA data were collected from 50° to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°C min−1with N2atmosphere using Rigaku TG/DTA8122 thermal analyzer. The FTIR spectra were acquired on a Nicolet IS10 system. The XAFS data were collected in fluorescence mode using the BL14W beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The relative data were analyzed with the standard procedures according to the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software package.

In a typical process, 2 mg of catalyst was first weighed and dispersed in 1 ml of ethanol solution. After sonication and homogenization, 100 μl was pipetted into the catalytic system. a-CuPd catalysts (0.2 mg) were dispersed in 5 ml of ethanol solvent, followed by addition of 30 μl of phenylacetylene. The mixed solution was purged with H2for several times and stirred at room temperature. The reaction solution was gathered through centrifugation and analyzed with a gas chromatography–mass spectrometer.
