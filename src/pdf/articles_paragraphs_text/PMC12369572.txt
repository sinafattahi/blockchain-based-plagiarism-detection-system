Physical activity is crucial for improving cardiovascular risk and overall health in kidney transplant recipients. However, changes in physical activity before and after transplantation remain underexplored.

To assess energy expenditure and physical activity before and after kidney transplantation over 1 year, analysing their relationship with cardiovascular risk factors.

A total of 112 individuals who had received a kidney transplant (aged ≥ 18 years) at a single transplant centre.

Sociodemographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was administered at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation to evaluate physical activity (as metabolic equivalent minutes per week). Laboratory parameters were also collected.

Descriptive statistics summarised participant characteristics. Inferential analyses (chi‐square,t‐tests, ANOVA, Mann–WhitneyU, Kruskal–Wallis) examined associations between physical activity and clinical variables (significancep< 0.05).

Participants had a median age of 58 years; 70.5% were men. Overall physical activity declined at 3 months, rebounded at 6, and decreased again at 12 months, remaining below the levels observed before transplantation. Men, participants not requiring dialysis before transplantation, individuals with overweight, and individuals with a history of cerebrovascular disease exhibited higher physical activity throughout follow‐up. Physical activity correlated with certain laboratory parameters, suggesting that better clinical status may foster greater physical activity engagement.

Tailored physical activity targeting comorbidities and nutritional status are recommended to improve long‐term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients, particularly among women, older adults, and those with multiple comorbidities.

Research on physical activity (PA) in kidney transplant recipients has become increasingly relevant in recent years, due to the benefits it can provide in improving their quality of life and general health (Costa‐Requena et al.2020; Masajtis‐Zagajewska et al.2019; Masiero et al.2020; Zhang et al.2023). According to WHO recommendations, adults and older people with these chronic conditions should accumulate a minimum of 150–300 min of moderate‐intensity aerobic PA, or 75–150 min of vigorous‐intensity aerobic PA, or an equivalent combination of moderate‐ and vigorous‐intensity activities, each week to achieve health benefits. As part of their weekly PA, older people with these chronic conditions should engage in varied, multi‐component physical activities that prioritise functional balance and moderate‐ or higher‐intensity strength training at least 3 days per week to improve functional capacity and prevent falls (World Health Organization2020). Most clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend the inclusion of exercise as part of standard care for transplant recipients (Baker et al.2022; Chen et al.2019; Muras‐Szwedziak et al.2019).

The KDIGO Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) recommend that patients in good cardiovascular health engage in at least 30 min of moderate activity five times per week, equivalent to 450–750 MET‐min/week, to maintain a BMI between 20 and 25, adopt a healthy lifestyle, and cease smoking (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes KDIGO CKD Work Group2024). However, kidney transplant patients often present with low levels of aerobic capacity, decreased muscle mass, and a sedentary lifestyle, partly owing to prior CKD (Calella et al.2019; Lendraitiene et al.2018; van Adrichem et al.2018) and the use of immunosuppressive medication (Dashti‐Khavidaki et al.2021; Pérez‐Granados et al.2022; Williams et al.2015). Decreased muscle mass and physical inactivity in these patients have been associated with poorer kidney function and reduced survival following kidney transplantation (Berben et al.2019; Chen et al.2019; Rangaswami et al.2019).

Kidney transplantation is considered the best therapeutic option for selected individuals with CKD, offering improved survival rates and better quality of life compared to other kidney replacement therapies (KRT) (Kute et al.2018). After transplantation, patients often experience improvements in anorexic, hypercatabolic, and psychological states, transitioning from an extremely restricted diet to a more normal, varied diet with fewer food‐related restrictions. Nonetheless, controlling diet and weight may remain challenging (Costa‐Requena et al.2017; Ndemera and Bhengu2017; Nutting et al.2021; Tantisattamo2017).

An increase in body weight after kidney transplantation has been observed and is associated, among other factors, with a decrease in PA during the first postoperative months, an increase in appetite, and the use of immunosuppressive therapy (Thomas‐Fonseca et al.2021). While obesity may confer a protective effect against all‐cause mortality in pre‐dialysis and haemodialysis patients, this benefit does not extend to transplant recipients (Ladhani et al.2017), as it is linked to reduced graft and patient survival, even with a functioning kidney (Bellini et al.2023; Devine et al.2019; Forte et al.2020; Kassam et al.2020). Currently, transplant recipients tend to be older and often have more comorbidities; although advances in immunosuppression and treatment have led to prolonged graft survival, minimising cardiovascular risk factors through lifestyle changes (e.g., balanced diet, regular PA) and adjusting immunosuppressive therapy remain crucial (Cheung and Tang2022; Takahashi et al.2018; Bellizzi et al.2014).

PA is a key public health strategy known to help control cardiovascular risk factors and improve aerobic and functional capacities (Kang et al.2019; Roi et al.2014; Yanishi et al.2017). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines PA as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that leads to energy expenditure and improved health (World Health Organization2020). It helps prevent overweight and obesity and reduces stress, which is especially beneficial for kidney transplant recipients (Billany et al.2025; González et al.2023; Villanego et al.2020; Yuguero‐Ortiz et al.2021). Conversely, physical inactivity—a major risk factor for global mortality—is associated with worse kidney function and decreased survival post‐transplant (García and González‐Jurado2017; Ponticelli and Favi2021). Indeed, inactive patients tend to present with lower muscle mass and poorer outcomes (Rangaswami et al.2019; Schardong et al.2018). In contrast, recipients who engage in regular PA show higher aerobic capacity, greater muscle strength, and reduced morbidity and mortality (Calella et al.2019; Kang et al.2020; Lima et al.2018; Totti et al.2020).

Despite extensive research on quality of life in kidney transplant recipients, further investigation is needed into the impact of day‐to‐day PA. Assessing PA in this population is an effective strategy to understand and evaluate changes before and after kidney transplantation and to elucidate the influence of underlying morbidity, cardiorespiratory status, and overall health (Dierkes et al.2018; Lima et al.2018; Raymond et al.2016; Seoane‐Pillado et al.2017). Accordingly, this study aims to measure energy expenditure and PA levels before and following transplantation, as well as their trajectory during the first postoperative year, and to analyse their relationship with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular events, dyslipidaemia, overweight, and obesity.

A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was conducted among kidney graft recipients aged 18 years or older at the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet (Zaragoza, Spain) between September 2020 and August 2023. It is a tertiary‐level, university‐affiliated hospital and the referral centre for kidney transplantation in Aragón, with 88 kidney transplants and 8 heart transplants performed in 2024 (Organización Nacional de Trasplantes2025). The study adhered to the STROBE recommendations for reporting observational studies (von Elm et al.2007). The inclusion criteria required participants to have signed the informed consent form. The participants were recruited during their preoperative hospitalisation. Individuals with an upper and/or lower limb amputation were excluded.

Sociodemographic and clinical variables were obtained from participants' clinical records, including age, sex, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI, obesity rate), and relevant comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, cardiorespiratory disease, cerebrovascular accident). Information on toxic habits (tobacco use, ethanol consumption), waiting time until transplantation, and type of pre‐transplant kidney replacement therapy (none, peritoneal dialysis, or haemodialysis) was also recorded. Additionally, the type of kidney transplant (living donor or deceased donor) was obtained; however, due to the low proportion of living donor cases, this variable was not included in the statistical analysis. Analytical data included urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, ferritin, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and HbA1c levels, these data were collected during the reception and preparation the day before surgery, and at 3, 6 and 12 months in the same week corresponding to the scheduled review with the nephrologist.

PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Craig et al.2003). Patients aged 18–65 completed the standard Spanish version (Román Viñas et al.2013), whereas those over 65 answered the IPAQ‐E (Rubio Castañeda et al.2017) (Appendices 1 and 2). The questionnaire evaluated PA before transplantation and was administered retrospectively through personal interviews conducted by the principal investigator before hospital discharge. Metabolic equivalent units (METs), which represent the energy cost of physical activities as multiples of the resting metabolic rate (with 1 MET corresponding to the energy expended at rest; moderate activities ranging from 3 to 6 METs; and vigorous activities exceeding 6 METs), were calculated to estimate energy expenditure per minute and per week. MET‐minutes were obtained by multiplying the MET value of each activity by the number of minutes spent on that activity per day or week. PA was categorised as high, moderate, or low (Table1) according to IPAQ criteria, where moderate‐intensity activities include those causing moderate increases in breathing or heart rate (such as brisk walking, dancing, or recreational cycling), and vigorous‐intensity activities are those causing substantial increases in breathing or heart rate (such as running, fast cycling, or aerobic exercises).

For the descriptive analysis, qualitative variables are expressed as absolute and relative frequencies (n, %), whereas quantitative variables are described via measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean ± standard deviation for normally distributed data, and median [interquartile range (IQR)] for non‐normally distributed data). Inferential analyses compared proportions when both variables were qualitative (Chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test), and compared means or ranks for quantitative variables. Parametric tests (Student'st‐test, ANOVA) were used for normally distributed data, and non‐parametric tests (Mann–WhitneyU, Kruskal–Wallis) were used for non‐normal distributions. Ap< 0.05 was considered statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.

Before data collection, participants were informed of the study's aims and procedures, and they provided written informed consent. They were also advised of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences. Permissions to use the IPAQ and IPAQ‐E questionnaires were obtained from the respective authors. All procedures followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (WHO, 2013), and patient anonymity was ensured by omitting names, initials, and medical record numbers. The study was approved by the hospital's management and the Ethics Research Committee of the Autonomous Community of Aragon (C.P. – C.I. PI20/278).

A total of 112 kidney transplant patients participated in this study. All the eligible patients agreed to take part and were recruited to participate in this investigation; no patients were lost to follow. Over two‐thirds (70.5%) were men, with a median age of 58 years (IQR: 19.3), ranging from 18 to 80; the majority (70.5%) were under 65 years of age. The main causes of CKD were glomerulopathies (27.68%), followed by unspecified causes (21.43%), polycystic kidney disease (12.50%), and diabetic nephropathy (12.50%). Overall, 65.2% of participants received kidney replacement therapy (KRT) via haemodialysis (HD), 26.8% via peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 8.0% did not require dialysis before transplantation. Nearly half had an arteriovenous fistula (44.6%) for vascular access, and the majority (88.4%) underwent their first kidney transplant. Most transplants were from deceased donors (89.3%). The median waiting time for transplantation was 326 days (IQR: 506; range: 1–2013), with men waiting longer (366 days, IQR: 481) than women (231 days, IQR: 456). In addition, patients under 65 years of age remained on the waiting list longer (387 days, IQR: 524) compared to those over 65 (194 days, IQR: 256), a difference that reached statistical significance (p= 0.010).

Regarding clinical comorbidities, 90.2% of the sample presented with arterial hypertension, while 52.7% had dyslipidaemia and half had a BMI above 25 kg/m² (34.0% overweight, 14.3% obese). Ischaemic heart disease was found in 26.0% of patients, 19.6% had diabetes, 18.0% reported toxic habits, 13.4% had respiratory disease, and 4.5% had a history of cerebrovascular accident. Notably, men had significantly higher mean BMI values than women (25.70 ± 4.03 vs. 23.60 ± 5.06;p= 0.020). When BMI was categorised, nearly half of the participants were of normal weight (47.3%), followed by overweight (34.0%) and obese (14.3%), with a statistically significant distribution in the gender distribution (p= 0.007). Analytical values revealed above‐normal averages for ferritin (384.85 ng/mL), creatinine (6.08 mg/dL), and serum urea (107.00 mg/dL). Total protein (6.60 g/dL), albumin (4 g/dL), and HbA1c (5.30%) remained within normal ranges, whereas haemoglobin (11.90 g/dL) and haematocrit (35.65%) were slightly low, whereas women had lower serum creatinine levels (p= 0.016). Table2summarises these baseline sociodemographic and clinical variables.

When examining PA in relation to qualitative variables, higher levels of PA were noted among men, participants aged over 65 years, those not undergoing dialysis, individuals with an arteriovenous fistula, and those classified as overweight. Greater PA was also observed among hypertensive participants, individuals without diabetes or dyslipidaemia, and those without ischaemic heart disease or respiratory disease. Moreover, participants reporting toxic habits or a history of stroke likewise displayed higher PA levels. No statistically significant differences were identified between the dependent variable (MET‐min/week) and the categorical independent variables under study (Table3).

Abbreviations: *, Mann Whitney U test; +, Kruskal Wallis test.

Globally, the median pre‐transplant PA was 1735 MET‐min/week (IQR: 1126–2922). This figure decreased to 1386 (IQR: 1040–2079) at 3 months post‐surgery, rebounded to 1906 (IQR: 1386–2392) at 6 months, and then declined again at 12 months to 1386 (IQR: 1040–2099) MET‐min/week. These 12‐month values did not return to pre‐transplant levels (Table4).

When PA was categorised, more than half of the patients (53%) reported vigorous activity before transplantation, decreasing to 46% at 3 months, then rising to 61% at 6 months, and falling back to 45% at 12 months. Around 31% of participants reported moderate PA before transplantation, increasing to 43% at 3 months, dropping again to 31% at 6 months, and finally rising to 48% 1 year after transplantation. At baseline, 16% of the population were (n= 18), but this proportion dropped progressively to 7.1% (n= 8) by the end of the first year (Table5).

Abbreviations: LPA, low physical activity (< 600 METs); MPA, moderate physical activity (600–1499 METs min/week); VPA, vigorous physical activity (> 1500 METs min/week).

When comparing PA changes over the 1‐year follow‐up with the qualitative independent variables, men reported higher PA levels than women at all time points. Statistically significant differences (p= 0.033) were found at 12 months, although both groups had lower PA levels than before transplantation (Table6). Examining PA evolution by gender (Figure1) revealed that men's PA declined at 3 months from pre‐transplant levels, whereas women's PA levels remained stable. At 6 months, both men and women recorded marked increases, without significant differences. Although significant differences emerged in the male subgroup across the four time points (p= 0.044).

Analysing PA by age group (Figure2) showed that participants aged over 65 had higher PA at all time points. Their PA peaked at 3 months—2079 (IQR: 1107) MET‐min/week—and remained stable at 6 months, before declining considerably at the end of the first year. Those younger than 65 showed a decrease in PA at 3 months—1386 (IQR: 1039)—followed by a recovery at 6 months, yet ultimately ended up below their pre‐transplant baseline by 12 months. Significant intra‐group differences were detected among participants under 65 (p= 0.032), whereas no statistically significant differences emerged between the two age groups.

In terms of RRT (Figure3), participants not requiring dialysis had higher PA at the first two measurements compared to those undergoing HD or PD, yet displayed a consistent decrease over time and remained stable at 12 months. PD and HD patients followed a similar pattern. No statistically significant differences were identified between PA and RRT.

Regarding BMI, overweight individuals displayed the highest PA levels at each measurement period. Although their PA declined by the 12‐month assessment, the mean PA in this group remained higher than in the other BMI categories (Figure4). Participants with low body weight experienced a notable PA recovery at 6 months, offsetting the decline they had shown at 3 months, and by the end of the study their PA levels were comparable to other groups. Statistically significant differences in PA by BMI category were observed at 6 months (p= 0.007).

Within the comorbidity analysis, participants with hypertension showed significant intra‐group differences in PA over time (p= 0.026). Similarly, significant changes in PA were found among those without diabetes (p= 0.007), without respiratory disease (p= 0.018), without stroke (p= 0.023), and those without de novo post‐transplant diabetes or toxic habits (p= 0.024).

Finally, correlations between PA and quantitative independent variables indicated a statistically significant positive correlation between serum urea levels and pre‐transplant PA (r= 0.207,p= 0.029). At 3 months, a positive correlation was found between haematocrit and PA (r= 0.214,p= 0.023), and at 12 months between albumin and PA (r= 0.196,p= 0.038). None of the remaining variables showed significant correlations with PA (Table7).

Our findings on sex distribution align with prior research indicating a higher incidence and faster progression of CKD in men, even though women are often found to have a greater overall prevalence of the disease (Gorostidi et al.2018; Melek et al.2018; Melsom et al.2022; Swartling et al.2021). These differences may reflect both biological and behavioural factors (Carrero et al.2018; Chesnaye et al.2024). Notably, our proportion of participants aged over 65 exceeded the usual 15%–20% cited in other cohorts, suggesting that expanding eligibility criteria and changing demographics may be increasing the number of older individuals receiving kidney transplants (Arias‐Cabrales et al.2018; Estupiñán‐Bohórquez et al.2021; Lehner et al.2018). Additionally, we observed higher overweight and obesity rates among men, in line with earlier studies (Pedreira‐Robles et al.2024).

PA levels declined at 3 months' post‐transplant—likely reflecting the immediate recovery period—then partially recovered at 6 and 12 months, yet remained below pre‐transplant values. This trajectory mirrors the findings of (Kumar et al.2019), who used the same questionnaire, although (Görücü and Ordin2022) reported higher PA levels at 1 year in a different setting. Our data also show that vigorous physical activity (VPA) decreased substantially by 12 months, potentially due to immunosuppressive side effects, fear of graft injury, or insufficient rehabilitation support (Zelle et al.2016; Zhang‐Xu et al.2011). By contrast, the proportion of individuals performing moderate PA (MPA) rose from 31% to 48% over the same period, a figure still lower than the 51.6%–59% range noted in other investigations (Masiero et al.2020; Raymond et al.2016).

Interestingly, a smaller percentage of participants in our cohort were classified as inactive compared to other studies, which have reported higher inactivity or predominantly low‐intensity PA (Byambasukh et al.2020; Kumar et al.2019), with men consistently reported more total PA than women (Kang et al.2019; Kumar et al.2019). Although this study did not specifically explore the reasons behind such disparities, factors such as cultural expectations, self‐efficacy, and social support may play pivotal roles in exercise behaviours (Costa‐Requena et al.2017; Wang2024; Zelle et al.2016).

Older adults, individuals not undergoing dialysis, and those with a history of transplantation presented distinct PA patterns, in agreement with Masiero et al. (2020) and Wilkinson et al. (2021). However, these findings differ from Görücü and Ordin (2022), who found no association between PA and variables such as age, sex, or donor type. Participants with hypertension, a history of stroke, or smoking habits showed higher PA levels, possibly indicating that these individuals are motivated to exercise to manage their comorbid conditions (van Adrichem et al.2018).

In our sample, overweight participants exhibited the highest PA levels across all time points, whereas underweight individuals made a marked improvement by 12 months, nearly matching the PA levels of other BMI groups. While multiple studies have documented relationships between BMI and PA, the dynamics of weight gain and BMI control may be especially complex in kidney transplant recipients, given immunosuppressive therapy, dietary factors, and comorbidities (Martín Salvador2019). An international randomised clinical trial by Kang et al. (2020) further underscores the relevance of PA in this population, demonstrating reduced cardiovascular events and mortality among more active patients. Improvements in left ventricular function and reduced ventricular hypertrophy are among the cardioprotective benefits linked to higher PA (Bishop et al.2023; Durán‐Sáinz et al.2023), a vital outcome given the high cardiovascular risk in transplant recipients (Thomas‐Fonseca et al.2021).

With respect to laboratory parameters, we found a positive correlation between pre‐transplant PA and serum urea, while haematocrit and albumin levels correlated with PA at 3 and 12 months, respectively. These associations may reflect better baseline health, nutritional status, or both, allowing patients to engage in more intense or consistent exercise (Flores‐Ojeda2023; Silva‐Filho et al.2019). However, they do not necessarily imply a causal relationship, and further prospective or interventional research would help clarify the direction of influence.

This study has several limitations. For instance, growing awareness of PA benefits might lead individuals to overestimate their level of activity. Another limitation is the use of self‐report questionnaires to assess PA. A potential limitation of this study is that PA was assessed retrospectively, after transplantation, based on patient recall. This may have introduced recall bias, particularly in older participants. Although validated and widely used, questionnaires such as the IPAQ may introduce recall bias and subjective inaccuracies compared with objective measurements such as those obtained via accelerometers. Nevertheless, the use of accelerometers also presents limitations, including economic constraints and the challenges associated with device placement and compliance among patients awaiting transplantation. Moreover, psychological factors and prior health education regarding the benefits of PA were not assessed as dependent variables, which may have influenced participants' PA levels. Finally, our study did not assess dietary habits or adherence to nutritional recommendations. Although nutritional counseling is an essential component of kidney replacement therapy, each modality involves specific dietary guidelines, and evaluating their implementation was beyond the scope of this study.

On the positive side, our sample comprised patients who were independent in their daily activities, thus minimising limitations in carrying out daily tasks and returning to work post‐transplant.

Our findings indicate that men, individuals with a pre‐transplant non‐dialysis status, those with overweight, and patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease exhibited higher levels of PA throughout the follow‐up period. These observations underscore the need to tailor post‐transplant PA programmes to each patient's comorbidities, weight status, and overall health profile to optimise rehabilitation and long‐term well‐being. Given the variability in PA patterns—particularly among women, older adults, and patients with complex comorbid conditions—healthcare professionals, especially nurses, should identify both facilitators and barriers to regular exercise. By adapting PA prescriptions to individual circumstances and providing ongoing education and support, it may be possible to enhance adherence, mitigate cardiovascular and metabolic risks, and ultimately improve graft function and patient survival. These findings should serve as a foundation for offering personalized exercise recommendations as soon as patients are added to the transplant waiting list, with a focus on encouraging PA especially among those with lower baseline activity levels.

Future research should explore how structured exercise interventions, delivered pre‐transplant, in the immediate postoperative period and extending into long‐term follow‐up, could further increase PA levels. Additionally, addressing the psychosocial determinants of PA, as well as objective measures of energy expenditure, may help refine personalised strategies that address the diverse needs of kidney transplant recipients.
