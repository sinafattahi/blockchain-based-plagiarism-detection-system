Dental anxiety in children is a prevalent concern that affects compliance and treatment outcomes in pediatric dentistry. Nonpharmacological behavioral interventions (NPBI), including virtual reality (VR) and tell‐show‐do (TSD), are commonly used to manage dental anxiety. This systematic review and meta‐analysis aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing anxiety and pain perception in pediatric dental patients.

Following PRISMA‐2020 guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science was conducted until April 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPBIs to controls in children undergoing dental procedures were included, focusing on changes in dental anxiety and pain. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS‐I tool for non‐randomized studies. Meta‐analysis was performed using a random‐effects model, with standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) calculated for anxiety and pain outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I² and Cochran's Q test.

Of 2,957 records, 76 RCTs with 6,723 participants were included. Distraction techniques did not significantly reduce dental anxiety compared to Tell‐Show‐Do (SMD −0.34, 95% CI −0.71 to 0.04) but were effective in reducing pain (SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.76 to −0.10). Virtual Reality (VR) distraction showed no significant reduction in anxiety or pain compared to traditional techniques.

While certain distraction techniques may alleviate pain, their impact on anxiety is comparable to that of traditional methods such as TSD. Despite this innovative approach, VR distraction did not demonstrate superiority over traditional techniques in reducing anxiety or pain.

Dental anxiety, a prevalent concern among pediatric patients, significantly hinders the delivery of effective dental care [1]. It is characterized by a spectrum of fearful responses to dental stimuli that not only affect children's immediate emotional well‐being but also have long‐term implications for oral health [2]. Dental anxiety manifests across various age groups and impacts individuals differently as they grow older. For example, studies have shown that the prevalence of dental anxiety in preschool‐aged children varies between 4% and 20% [3], whereas in school‐aged children aged 6 to 12 years, it fluctuates between 8% and 23% [4]. Among adolescents, the range is slightly narrower, from 7% to 18% [5], whereas in adults, dental anxiety prevalence is notably higher, ranging from 14% to 30% [6].

Studies indicate that early experiences of dental anxiety can lead to avoidance of dental care, resulting in poor oral hygiene, an increased incidence of dental caries, and a higher likelihood of requiring extensive dental interventions later in life [7,8,9]. The traditional approach to managing dental anxiety in children predominantly relies on pharmacological intervention. However, concerns about possible side effects, the potential for sedation‐related complications, and the growing preference for nonpharmacological alternatives have shifted the focus towards behavioral management techniques [10].

Behavioral management strategies in pediatric dentistry encompass a range of interventions designed to alleviate anxiety, improve patient cooperation, and facilitate the delivery of dental care without resorting to sedation or pharmacological means [11]. These methods include but are not limited to cognitive‐behavioral therapy, desensitization [12], distraction techniques [13], virtual reality [14], and parent‐child interaction therapies [10]. Despite the appeal of these nonpharmacological approaches, evidence regarding their efficacy, applicability, and best practices remains fragmented and inconclusive.

Responding to the critical need for effective, safe, and child‐friendly management of dental anxiety, this systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted to provide evidence on nonpharmacological behavioral management techniques for children with dental anxiety. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing dental anxiety levels and improving behavioral outcomes during dental visits.

This study was performed adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis (PRISMA‐2020) guidelines [15]. The methodologies and analyses were performed in full adherence to the principles outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses and the Guide for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews [16]. The protocol used for this systematic review was registered on the international platform for systematic reviews and meta‐analysis (INPLASY 202440064).

A systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science, was conducted through April 2024. Specific keywords were used to identify the potentially relevant studies. Further records were manually extracted. The specific keywords and results for each database are listed in Table1.

Predetermined criteria were utilized for the selection and exclusion of the obtained records. The parameters for inclusion were defined using the PICOS model as follows:Population: Children undergoing dental procedures; Intervention: all types of nonpharmacological behavioral interventions (NPBIs) aimed at reducing dental anxiety;Comparator: No intervention, no distraction, standard care, or another type of NPBI;Outcomes: Dental anxiety was measured using the heart rate‐facial image scale, Venham's picture test, Abeer Children Dental Anxiety Scale, and visual analog scale (VAS), among others;Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Studies conducted in languages other than English, as well as theses, conference abstracts, and studies with unreliable data that could not be extracted or analyzed, were excluded.

Two authors independently implemented the selection criteria. The eligibility screening process consisted of two steps. First, abstracts were examined to determine eligibility, and subsequently, full‐text articles of the qualifying abstracts were obtained and reviewed for eligibility. Then, an online data extraction sheet was created, accessible to the two authors who conducted the data extraction. The extracted data included (1) study ID, (2) study publication year, (3) country, (4) study design, (5) number of participants, (6) age range, (7) intervention and control, (8) methods of assessment, (9) evaluation time, (10) changes in fear and anxiety, (11) changes in pain, and (12) completion of treatment.

In accordance with the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Review and Meta‐analysis [16], the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool 2 (RoB‐II) was used to assess the risk of bias in RCTs. This tool assesses seven essential areas of potential bias: (1) sequence generation, (2) allocation concealment, (3) blinding of participants and personnel, (4) blinding of outcome evaluation, (5) insufficient outcome data, (6) selective reporting, and (7) other possible sources of bias. Two authors independently assessed each of the aforementioned domains across the studies, assigning ratings of unclear, low, or high risks of bias. The Risk of Bias in Non‐Randomized Studies of Intervention (ROBINS‐I) tool was used to assess the bias in non‐randomized studies. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test, where ap‐value < 0.05 indicated significant asymmetry.

The parameters assessed were the extent of dental fear and anxiety using multiple assessment tools, including the Dental Subscale of Children's Fear Survey Schedule (CFSS‐DS), Facial Image Scale (FIS), Raghavendra Mahuriu Sujata Pictorial Scale (RMS‐PS), Frankl's Behavior Scale for Ratings (FBRS), and Venham Images Test (VPT). Pain modification was assessed using self‐reported pain measures (WBFS) and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale. The SMD and its related 95% CI were computed by aggregating all scales in the paired meta‐analysis models. Statistical analysis was conducted using the STATA software version 18. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05. A random‐effects model was employed to account for the expected variability among studies, resulting from differences in interventions and study populations. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, including variations in anxiety measurement scales and intervention types.

All statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) and R software (metafor package). A random‐effects model was employed to conduct the meta‐analysis, taking into account the expected variability among studies due to differences in interventions and study populations.

Ap‐value < 0.10 in Cochran's Q test was considered indicative of significant heterogeneity.

The Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was used to estimate the pooled effect size for anxiety and pain reduction. The inverse variance method was applied to weigh individual study contributions based on sample sizes and standard deviations.

A leave‐one‐out sensitivity analysis was conducted by systematically omitting one study at a time to assess the robustness of the pooled effect size. To investigate potential moderators contributing to the observed heterogeneity, a meta‐regression analysis was performed using the ‘metafor’ package in R. The following moderators were examined: (1) mean age of participants, (2) type of intervention (e.g., VR vs. TSD vs. other distraction techniques), (3) type of dental procedure (invasive vs. noninvasive), and (4) type of anxiety assessment tool (self‐reported vs. observational vs. physiological). Meta‐regression was conducted only for outcomes with at least 10 studies to ensure sufficient statistical power, as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook [16]. Results were considered statistically significant atp< 0.05.

A random‐effects model was used to account for the expected variability among studies due to differences in interventions and study populations. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, including variations in anxiety measurement scales and intervention types.

The search strategy yielded 926 records from PubMed, 1170 records from Scopus, 535 records from the Web of Science Core Collection, and 326 records from the Cochrane Library, totaling 2957 records. These records were imported into the EndNote software, which was then used to automatically detect and eliminate 1109 duplicate records. After duplicates were removed, 1848 records remained and underwent preliminary screening based on their titles and abstracts. This process resulted in the exclusion of 1718 records. The full texts of the remaining 130 studies were then assessed against more detailed criteria, resulting in 76 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the review. The PRISMA flow diagram is shown in Figure1.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis included 76 RCTs with a total of 6,723 participants, spanning a 39‐year period from 1985 to 2024. Regarding the geographical distribution, 28 RCTs were conducted in India, 7 in Iran, 5 in Saudi Arabia, 5 in Brazil, 5 in China, 3 in the USA, 3 in Spain, 2 in Egypt, 2 in Thailand, 2 in the UK, and finally, one RCT in each of the following countries: Bangladesh, France, Greece, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Sweden, Syria, and Turkey. After applying the RoB‐II to the 76 included studies, the results were obtained and presented graphically. Additional details of the included studies are presented in Table2. Figure2presents the authors' assessments of the risk of bias for each item in the individual studies. Approximately 25% of the 76 included studies were classified as low risk, 45% as moderate risk, and 30% as high risk of bias across all domains (Figure3), with participant blinding and outcome assessment being the most common sources of bias. Figure3displays these assessments as percentages, summarizing the risk of bias across all included studies.

The meta‐analysis was performed by pooling data on changes in dental anxiety ratings from nine studies. The results indicated that distraction strategies did not result in a statistically significant decrease in anxiety scores compared to controls (Standardized Mean Difference −0.34, 95% Confidence Interval −0.71 to 0.04, I² = 82.56%). Figure4displays the corresponding plot, with the I² score suggesting substantial heterogeneity in the data. To address this heterogeneity, an additional subgroup meta‐analysis was conducted using a specific assessment approach, with results presented in Figure5. However, the analysis found that distraction strategies led to a statistically significant reduction in pain, with a standardized mean difference of −0.43 (95% CI −0.76 to −0.10, I² = 0.00%). Figure6shows the full plot. To further explore this outcome, a subgroup analysis was conducted based on the pain assessment method, and the results are illustrated in Figure7.

The meta‐analysis results showed that VR distraction was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in dental anxiety compared with traditional distraction techniques (SMD −0.47, 95% CI, −0.96, 0.02, I271.14%). The forest plot is shown in Figure8. The I2value indicated significant heterogeneity in the results. An additional subgroup meta‐analysis was conducted using the same assessment method to attempt to resolve heterogeneity. The results of the subgroup meta‐analysis are shown in Figure9. The results also showed that VR distraction, when compared to other traditional distraction techniques, was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD −058, 95% CI −2.14 to 0.98, I296.59%). The forest plot is shown in Figure10. The I2value indicated significant heterogeneity in the results. Another subgroup meta‐analysis was conducted based on the assessment method used to resolve heterogeneity. The results of this subgroup meta‐analysis are presented in Figure11.

Meta‐regression was conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity in anxiety and pain outcomes. For anxiety outcomes (nine studies), the type of intervention (VR vs. TSD) and mean participant age were significant moderators (p= 0.03 andp= 0.04, respectively), explaining approximately 45% of the heterogeneity. Specifically, VR‐based interventions showed larger effect sizes in older children (mean age > 8 years) compared to younger ones. The type of dental procedure and assessment tool did not significantly influence heterogeneity (p> 0.10). For pain outcomes, due to the limited number of studies (n< 10), meta‐regression was not feasible, highlighting a limitation in exploring pain‐related heterogeneity.

Distraction techniques significantly reduced pain (SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.76 to −0.10, Figure6) and showed comparable anxiety reduction to TSD (SMD −0.34, 95% CI −0.71 to 0.04, Figure4), suggesting clinical value in specific contexts, particularly for pain management.

Distraction techniques have increasingly garnered attention in medical and dental settings as safe and cost‐effective methods to enhance patient experience during invasive and painful procedures [88]. These noninvasive interventions, which range from simple audiovisual aids to more sophisticated virtual reality systems, offer significant potential to alleviate patient discomfort and anxiety without complications associated with pharmacological options [89]. By integrating these techniques, healthcare professionals can significantly improve the procedural environment, making it less daunting for patients, especially those who are particularly sensitive to pain or anxiety [90].

The results of this study highlight the potential of nonpharmacological behavior interventions (NPBIs) in effectively managing dental anxiety in young patients. Despite the heterogeneity observed in the study outcomes, certain trends have emerged that offer valuable insights for clinical practice and future research. Furthermore, nonpharmacological behavior management methods have been emphasized as essential in pediatric dental practice to prevent overutilization of sedation and general anesthesia, highlighting the importance of these interventions in managing dental anxiety in young patients [91].

Distraction techniques, a core component of NPBIs, did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in dental anxiety compared to the Tell‐Show‐Do (TSD) method, according to the present analysis. This suggests that while distraction can be an effective tool for managing dental anxiety, its efficacy may not universally surpass that of traditional behavioral methods such as TSD. However, the observed reduction in pain associated with distraction techniques underscores their value in pediatric dental settings. The ability of these techniques to alleviate pain, a tangible outcome, suggests that they play a crucial role in improving the dental‐care experience of children, potentially increasing their willingness to undergo dental procedures.

The findings align with those reported by Almarzouq et al. [3], indicating that distraction techniques are effective in reducing self‐rated anxiety, improving cooperation, and lowering the pulse rate in contrast to TSD, except for more invasive dental procedures. This supports the effectiveness of diversion techniques in specific situations, while emphasizing their constraints in more demanding or unpleasant circumstances, as noted by Almarzouq et al. [3]. Considerable variability and heterogeneity were observed in the effects of NPBIs, suggesting that individual factors and specific contexts significantly influenced the outcomes.

In terms of specific interventions, Almarzouq et al. [3] found that distraction techniques were generally effective in reducing self‐rated anxiety and improving cooperation, particularly when compared to the Tell‐Show‐Do (TSD) method. In contrast, the current analysis showed that distraction techniques did not result in a statistically significant reduction in dental anxiety compared with TSD although they were effective in reducing pain. This discrepancy could be attributed to differences in the studies' inclusion criteria, dental procedures examined, or the anxiety assessment methods used.

VR techniques, such as VR eyeglasses, have been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing anxiety in children during dental procedures such as extraction [92]. Some studies have shown promising results in reducing anxiety levels in children undergoing dental procedures [70,83,93]. Tanja et al. highlighted the potential of VR distraction to interrupt the cycle of dental anxiety by blocking the development of vivid memories during dental procedures [94].

However, Hamed et al. and Zhang et al. suggested that VR distraction may not be as effective in reducing anxiety levels in children during dental procedures [95,96]. Additionally, Prado et al. reported mixed results, indicating that distraction techniques, including audiovisual distraction, showed varying effects in reducing dental anxiety and fear levels in children [97]. Similarly, Liu et al. found low‐quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of audiovisual distraction in relieving dental anxiety in children [98]. Furthermore, Du et al. concluded that there is no definitive conclusion regarding whether VR reduces dental anxiety in children [22].

An examination of VR distractions presents a nuanced perspective. Although VR did not show a statistically significant reduction in dental anxiety compared with other traditional distraction techniques, this finding should be interpreted with caution. The significant heterogeneity and marginal effect sizes suggest that VR distraction may still hold promise under certain conditions or for specific patient subsets. This highlights the need for further research to delineate the contexts in which VR and other innovative distraction methods are most effective. Additionally, the inconsistent efficacy of VR distraction, with no significant reduction in anxiety (SMD −0.47, 95% CI −0.96 to 0.02, Figure8) or pain (SMD −0.58, 95% CI −2.14 to 0.98, Figure10) compared to traditional methods, aligns with Hamed et al. [95] and Zhang et al. [96] but contrasts with Alshatrat et al. [70] and Nunna et al. [93]. Factors modulating VR's effectiveness include levels of interactivity, with passive VR (e.g., videos) providing temporary distraction and interactive VR (e.g., gamified environments) enhancing engagement, as reported by Koticha et al. [92]. Novelty effects may initially reduce anxiety, but wane with repeated exposure [22]. Child engagement, influenced by age and content relevance, is critical; younger children (3–6 years) may find VR headsets uncomfortable, while older children respond better to tailored content [93]. The high heterogeneity (I² = 71.14% for anxiety, Figure8) suggests VR's efficacy is context‐dependent, with potential for subgroups like older children, as indicated by subgroup analyses (Figure9).

The substantial heterogeneity observed in the meta‐analysis (I² = 82.56% for anxiety outcomes, I² = 71.14% for VR anxiety, I² = 96.59% for VR pain) suggests that various factors may influence the effectiveness of nonpharmacological behavioral interventions. Possible moderators include differences in study design, intervention types (VR‐based vs. traditional distraction), clinical settings, and the age distribution of participants. Future studies should focus on subgroup analyses to determine which populations benefit most from specific interventions. Table3details potential sources, including age demographics (3–14 years), with younger children (3–6 years) responding differently to interventions like Virtual Reality (VR) due to cognitive and emotional differences. Intervention types (e.g., TSD, VR, audiovisual distraction) target various psychological mechanisms, resulting in inconsistent effect sizes. Study methodologies, such as procedure type (invasive vs. noninvasive) and assessment timing, contribute to variability. Diverse assessment tools (CFSS‐DS, VPT, heart rate) differ in sensitivity, exacerbating heterogeneity. Cultural and clinical contexts may also influence outcomes. Subgroup analyses (Figures5,7,9,11) and meta‐regression identified age and intervention type as significant moderators for anxiety, explaining ~45% of variability, with VR showing larger effects in older children (mean age > 8 years).

Potential Sources of Heterogeneity and Their Hypothesized Impact.

Moreover, the risk of bias assessment (Figures2and3) revealed that ~60% of studies had a high or unclear risk of bias in participant blinding and ~50% in outcome assessment, which impacted the reliability of the results. Unblinded participants in VR studies [70,83] may overestimate anxiety reduction due to performance bias, inflating subjective measures like CFSS‐DS or VPT. Unblinded assessors using observational scales (Frankl Behavior Rating Scale [FBRS]) [34,40] may exaggerate effect sizes, contributing to heterogeneity (I² = 82.56%, Figure4). Objective measures (e.g., heart rate) [23,79] are less biased but less common. Low‐risk studies (e.g., Ran et al. [23], Ghaderi et al. [63], ~25% of studies) reported smaller effect sizes, suggesting more reliable findings, while high‐risk studies [34] ( ~30%) drove variability. Subjective measures, which are predominant in the meta‐analysis, are prone to bias, whereas objective measures lack sensitivity for detecting nuanced changes in anxiety.

The present study had several limitations and challenges that may have influenced the results and their interpretations. Variations in the application and evaluation of interventions such as virtual reality (VR) and traditional distraction techniques are particularly notable. These differences make it difficult to assess and compare their effectiveness in different settings and populations definitively. Additionally, many studies included in this review exhibited a moderate to high risk of bias, particularly concerning the blinding of participants and outcome assessors, which is a common issue in behavioral studies where double‐blinding is often not feasible. In future research, these findings will highlight the importance of methodological rigor and the need for standardization in measuring outcomes related to dental anxiety and pain. The risk of bias assessment revealed moderate to high bias in several studies, particularly in participant blinding and selective reporting. These limitations could influence the reliability of the findings. Future trials should prioritize rigorous blinding procedures and pre‐registered protocols to minimize bias and improve study validity. Developing a standardized set of metrics and protocols for evaluating the effectiveness of NPBIs would not only facilitate more reliable comparisons across studies but also aid in the development of evidence‐based guidelines for implementing NPBIs in pediatric dentistry. The high heterogeneity (I² > 70%), moderate to high risk of bias, and variable efficacy of NPBIs (e.g., VR) posed challenges in synthesizing results. The inability to perform comprehensive meta‐regression for pain outcomes and reliance on subjective measures in high‐risk studies likely inflated effect sizes. The variable efficacy across patient and procedural contexts highlights the need for personalized intervention strategies. Future studies should standardize reporting, minimize bias, and investigate tailored approaches to improve reliability.

In clinical practice, selecting the appropriate nonpharmacological intervention depends on multiple factors, including patient anxiety levels, treatment type, and feasibility. For instance, VR distraction may be more effective for highly anxious children undergoing invasive procedures, whereas simpler techniques, such as tell‐show‐do (TSD), can be more practical in routine dental visits where minimal equipment is required. Pediatric dentists should assess each patient's specific needs to optimize anxiety management strategies.

Moreover, exploring the long‐term effects of NPBIs on dental anxiety and oral health behaviors remains a critical area for future investigation. Understanding how these interventions affect children's willingness to seek and receive dental care over time can inform strategies for mitigating dental anxiety and its associated negative outcomes. Finally, considering the practical aspects of implementing NPBIs in routine dental care, studies evaluating the cost‐effectiveness of such interventions are crucial. This includes not only the direct costs associated with the interventions themselves but also potential savings from the reduced need for sedation, improved patient cooperation, and fewer repeat visits due to untreated dental issues.

This meta‐analysis of 76 RCTs shows that nonpharmacological behavioral interventions (NPBIs), especially distraction techniques, significantly reduce pain in children during dental procedures (SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.76 to −0.10, Figure6) but not anxiety compared to tell‐show‐do (SMD −0.34, 95% CI −0.71 to 0.04, Figure4). Virtual reality (VR) distraction is not superior (SMD −0.47 for anxiety, Figure8; SMD −0.58 for pain, Figure10), but it shows potential for use with older children or less invasive procedures (Figures5,9). Distraction techniques provide a noninvasive and cost‐effective approach to pain management. However, high heterogeneity (I² > 70%, Figures4,8,10) and moderate to high risk of bias (Figures2,3) require cautious interpretation. Variable NPBI efficacy, influenced by age, interactivity, and assessment methods, necessitates tailored interventions based on patient and procedural factors. Future research should standardize outcomes, reduce bias, and explore long‐term effects to optimize NPBIs in pediatric dentistry.
