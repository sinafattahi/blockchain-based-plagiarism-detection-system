The COVID-19 vaccination is a key strategy to control the pandemic; however, complex factors, including health awareness and social cognition, influence public intention to vaccinate. The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a theoretical framework for understanding vaccination behavior, but how Vaccination awareness (VA) dynamically moderates the relationship between HBM domains and vaccination intentions remains unclear. This study aims to compare the characteristics of different VA classifications and explore the key factors influencing their future COVID-19 vaccination intentions based on the HBM.

Using three-wave longitudinal cohort data from 500 adults in mainland China, participants were divided into four groups based on VA states: persistent awareness (Group 1), early-only awareness (Group 2), late-emerging awareness (Group 3), and persistently unaware (Group 4). ANOVA, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the relationships between HBM constructs, social cues, and vaccination intentions.

Group 1 (31.40%) had the highest education level, the COVID-19 vaccination rate (48.35%), and future vaccination intention (36.98%), with significantly higher HBM scores (perceived severity, self-efficacy, benefits) than other groups (allp< 0.001). Group 4 (27.00%) had the highest proportion of unvaccinated individuals (40.31%) and the highest perceived barriers score (M = 2.39 ± 0.73). Logistic regression showed that Group 1’s future COVID-19 vaccination intention was driven by medical expert advice (OR= 3.08, 95%CI: 1.47–6.45) and self-efficacy (OR= 3.68, 95%CI: 1.53–8.87), while Group 4 relied on government advice (OR= 1.56, 95%CI: 1.02–2.40), perceived severity (OR= 1.97, 95%CI: 1.12–3.46), and self-efficacy (OR= 3.68, 95%CI: 1.77–5.84). Trust in social media significantly reduced Group 3’s vaccination intention (OR= 0.08, 95%CI: 0.02–0.35).

Vaccination awareness states influence vaccination decisions by moderating HBM domains and social cues. Targeted interventions should address group-specific differences, such as enhancing self-efficacy (for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 4), correcting social media misinformation ( for Group 3), and strengthening government communication (for Group 4).

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unprecedented threats to global health and socioeconomic stability, with over 695 million cases and 6.91 million deaths reported by mid-2023 [1,2]. While vaccination remains the most cost-effective strategy to mitigate transmission and severity [3,4], vaccine hesitancy (VH)—defined as delayed acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability—persists as a critical barrier to herd immunity [5,6]. Key factors driving COVID-19 VH include safety concerns (34.5% of studies), fear of side effects (38.7%), doubts about efficacy (29.4%), distrust in health systems (27.9%), and exposure to misinformation (14.3%) [7]. Enhancing Vaccine Literacy (VL) is a promising strategy to address vaccine hesitancy [8]. By improving the public’s understanding of vaccines, we can better regulate vaccine messaging and facilitate effective communication, ultimately targeting and reducing vaccine hesitancy [9].

Vaccine Literacy (VL), as a critical component of health literacy, encompasses not only fundamental knowledge about vaccines but, more significantly, the ability of individuals to access, comprehend, evaluate, and apply vaccine-related information to make informed decisions [10]. Research demonstrates that higher levels of VL are significantly associated with greater vaccine acceptance, as evidenced in studies on HPV vaccination among university students and COVID-19 vaccination among adults [11,12].

Drawing on the structure of health literacy, health awareness is often regarded as its core cognitive foundation, reflecting an individual’s attentiveness to health and grasp of basic health knowledge and concepts [13]. This foundational cognitive awareness significantly influences an individual’s health-related behavior patterns and lifestyle [14]. Similarly, as a specific manifestation of health literacy in the domain of vaccination, VL should likewise be grounded upon a fundamental cognitive level: the individual’s cognition and valuation of the importance, value, and role of vaccination in personal and public health. We conceptualize this as Vaccine Awareness (VA).

Numerous studies have explored the significant impact of factors such as perceived disease severity, perceived vaccine safety, social norms [15,16], personal consequences, prior vaccination experiences [17], and positive attitudes towards vaccines within social networks [18] on vaccine understanding and vaccination intention. However, comparatively, empirical research focusing on how individuals’ foundational vaccine awareness– that is, their fundamental cognition and valuation of the necessity and value of vaccination– directly influences vaccine acceptance remains scarce.

This study defines VA as an individual’s cognitive understanding and intrinsic valuation of vaccination’s core value and necessity in preventing disease and protecting personal and community health. This definition seeks to capture the deeper cognitive roots underlying vaccine hesitancy– namely, the fundamental recognition or absence of recognition of the role and significance of vaccines. Research focusing on VA holds promise for providing a new theoretical basis and intervention entry points for designing more targeted strategies to enhance vaccine literacy and communication, effectively addressing vaccine hesitancy.

The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been developed to predict behaviors that prevent health problems. According to HBM, people consider their risk of getting sick, the seriousness of the illness, the benefits of taking action, the barriers to taking action, their confidence in their ability to take action, and triggers that encourage action when they make health decisions [19,20]. Previous studies have shown that HBM can explain vaccination behaviors for flu [21,22], H1N1 (swine) flu [23], and HPV [24]. However, COVID-19 vaccination presents new challenges. Fast development times [25–27], safety or side effects [28], and trusted sources of information change how people view vaccines [29]. These issues shape vaccination awareness and how that awareness interacts with HBM domains to influence intentions.

This study addresses two important gaps. First, while previous research identifies fixed predictors of vaccine acceptance, we know less about how changing levels of vaccination awareness affect these predictors. Second, while regional studies highlight the importance of tailoring behavioral interventions, few studies connect social and cognitive theories with data on specific reasons people hesitate to get vaccinated against COVID-19. By exploring the link between vaccination awareness and vaccination intentions and clarifying the role of HBM in these dynamics, this research aims to provide policymakers with targeted strategies to increase vaccine uptake.

This study bridges two critical gaps in vaccination behavior research. First, while prior work has focused primarily on static predictors of vaccine acceptance, we examine how dynamic changes in vaccination awareness influence these predictors—a crucial consideration during evolving pandemics. Second, although regional studies highlight the importance of tailored interventions, few have systematically integrated sociocognitive theories with empirical data on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across different awareness trajectories. Through longitudinal analysis, we demonstrate how varying levels of vaccination awareness affect behavioral intentions and elucidate the mediating role of HBM constructs. These findings provide policymakers with evidence-based strategies to enhance vaccine uptake through targeted awareness-building interventions.

This study recruited adults aged ≥ 18 in mainland China through the WENJUANXING platform (wjx.cn) since December 2020. Stratified random sampling was implemented based on China’s Sixth National Population Census data, with age stratification as follows: 18–30 years (target proportion: 20.32%), 31–50 years (33.43%), and 51–70 years (19.49%), and a gender ratio of 1:1 (male: female). Sample size determination followed the standards of structural equation modeling (SEM), requiring a minimum ratio of 1:10 of observations to measured variables. With 54 initial observed variables in this study, 540 participants constituted the minimum requirement. Participants completed the questionnaire using a smartphone or computer through the link provided by the platform, and each participant could only complete it once with their unique ID number. Those who submitted a valid questionnaire were given a gift as acknowledgment. Quality control questions were included in the questionnaire, and those with illogical answers or identical responses for all options were treated as invalid.

At baseline (Wave 1, December 2020), 1,815 participants completed the initial survey. All Wave 1 respondents were invited to two follow-up waves: Wave 2 (January 2021,n= 749 retained, retention rate = 39.3%) and Wave 3 (April 2021,n= 500 retained, cumulative retention rate = 26.3%), As shown in Fig.1. The analytic sample focused on the 500 individuals completing all three waves, with primary analyses examining trajectories of vaccination awareness and vaccination intent between Waves 2 and 3. The study protocol was approved by the Peking University Institutional Review Board (IRB00001052-20081), and the questionnaire was conducted after respondents understood the survey and signed the informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants reported gender, age, education level (categorized as high School and below, undergraduate, postgraduate and above), marital status (single/married), monthly household income (grouped as <$689, $689–$1378, >$1378), and Vaccination Knowledge (15 points total, consisting of 7 judgment questions and 4 multiple choice questions).

The content of the questionnaire is shown in Appendix Table 7.

Although ‘Cues to Action’ is a domain of the HBM, it has been presented under a separate heading in this study to emphasize its importance and uniqueness, particularly in relation to the inclusion of media trust.

Social cues: Advice from physicians, relatives/friends, medical experts, and government (e.g., “My doctor recommends COVID-19 vaccination”).

Media trust: Confidence in traditional media (national/local TV, newspapers, government websites) and social media (TikTok, Weibo, WeChat official accounts) regarding pandemic information (5-point Likert scales).

Immediate intention (combining “Definitely yes” and “Probably yes” responses).

Delayed intention (aggregating “Uncertain”, “Probably not”, and “Definitely not” responses).

Current vaccination status was captured through binary self-report (“Yes”/“No”).

Group 4 (Persistently unaware,n=135): Consistently negative VA at Wave 2/Wave 3.

Chi-square tests compared sociodemographic distributions among awareness states. Mean scores (± SD) of HBM constructs were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, with Tukey’s post-hoc tests for intergroup comparisons. Binary logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of vaccination intention (dependent variable: delayed = 0 vs. demand =). Independent variables comprised: sociodemographic factors, HBM domain scores, and social cues. Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were conducted using SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp.), with statistical significance set at α = 0.05 (two-tailed).

This study enrolled 500 participants, with a near-balanced gender distribution (female: 46.80%) and predominant representation from the 30–39 age group (48.80%). The cohort exhibited high educational attainment (83.00% held bachelor’s degrees or higher) and marital status (72.60% married), with household incomes primarily clustered in the $689-$1378/month range (33.20%). At survey administration, 48.40% had received COVID-19 vaccination, while 62.20% expressed immediate willingness to vaccinate against emerging variants (demand group).

Significant intergroup disparities were observed across the four VA classifications. Gender distribution analysis revealed that males predominated in Group 1 (persistent awareness; 35.41%), while females were most prevalent in Group 2 (early-only awareness; 28.63%). Educational attainment patterns showed Group 1 represented 29.64% of bachelor’s degree holders and 50.00% of postgraduate participants. Regarding vaccination behaviors, Group 4 (persistently unaware) accounted for 40.31% of unvaccinated individuals, whereas Group 1 constituted 48.35% of vaccinated participants. For future vaccination intention, Group 4 represented 37.04% of vaccine-hesitant individuals, while Group 1 comprised 36.98% of the immediate demand group. Key findings indicate that the persistent awareness group is closely associated with higher education levels, vaccination status, and positive future intentions, whereas the no awareness group is predominant among unvaccinated and delayed vaccination populations. As shown in Table1.

As presented in Table2, one-way ANOVA demonstrated statistically significant differences in Health Belief Model (HBM) construct scores among the four VA groups: perceived severity (F= 4.84,p= 0.002), self-efficacy (F= 31.51,p< 0.001), perceived benefits (F= 8.42,p< 0.001), and perceived barriers (F= 21.39,p< 0.001). Post-hoc Tukey tests (Appendix Table 5) identified distinct patterns across groups. Group 1 (persistent awareness) consistently exhibited the highest scores for perceived severity (M= 4.36 ± 0.67), self-efficacy (M= 4.30 ± 0.49), and perceived benefits (M= 4.29 ± 0.45), whereas Group 4 (persistently unaware) showed the lowest scores in these dimensions (M= 4.08 ± 0.75,M= 3.64 ± 0.80, andM= 3.96 ± 0.63, respectively). For perceived barriers, Group 4 reported the highest levels (M= 2.39 ± 0.73), followed by Group 2 (M= 2.31 ± 0.76) and Group 3 (M= 1.99 ± 0.66), with Group 1 demonstrating the lowest barriers (M= 1.84 ± 0.57). These results align with theoretical expectations from the HBM framework - groups with more favorable profiles (elevated severity/benefit/self-efficacy perceptions coupled with reduced barriers) showed stronger vaccination intent. Specifically, Group 1’s optimal HBM profile correlated with the highest future vaccination willingness, while Group 4’s unfavorable scores corresponded to the lowest intent levels.

In Table3, the analysis revealed significant between-group differences in action cue utilization across all measured domains, with Group 1 (persistent awareness) demonstrating consistently superior engagement. Specifically, this group achieved the highest scores in both knowledge (F= 6.83,M= 8.60 ± 1.02) and traditional media trust (F= 10.81,M= 4.44 ± 0.47), significantly outperforming Groups 2–4 (Tukey’s HSD allp< 0.05; see Appendix Table 6). A hierarchical pattern emerged for interpersonal and institutional cues: Group 1 showed strongest responsiveness to advice from relatives/friends (M= 4.15 ± 0.62), healthcare professionals (M= 4.47 ± 0.48), and medical experts (M= 4.33 ± 0.52), followed sequentially by Groups 3 and 2, while Group 4 (persistently unaware) consistently scored lowest across all domains. According to the Health Belief Model, higher scores in these action cues are associated with stronger behavioral intentions. Therefore, individuals in Group 1 are likely to exhibit the strongest intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the future.

2. knowledge scote range from 3 to 10. A higher score in the COVID-19 vaccine-related knowledge reflects an individual’s greater understanding of the scientific principles of vaccines, the vaccination process, safety, and other relevant information.

Group 4 (persistently unaware), government advice (OR= 1.56, 95%CI: 1.02–2.40), perceived severity (OR= 1.97, 95%CI: 1.12–3.46), and self-efficacy (OR= 3.21, 95%CI: 1.77–5.84) were significant motivators. Self-efficacy consistently boosted intent across all groups, while trust in social media uniquely hindered intent in Group 3.

The four vaccine awareness (VA) classifications exhibited significant divergence in demographic profiles and Health Belief Model (HBM) construct scores. Group 1 (persistent awareness) predominantly comprised married, highly educated individuals, demonstrating the highest self-efficacy levels (M = 4.30 ± 0.49) and vaccination uptake rate (48.4%). Conversely, Group 4 (persistently unaware) was characterized by lower socioeconomic status indicators—including reduced educational attainment and household income—and the lowest vaccination rate, coupled with elevated perceived barriers (M = 2.39 ± 0.73). This stratification reflects the close link between vaccination awareness and socioeconomic status, which is the higher the level of education, the greater the awareness of vaccine. For instance, Gusar et al. found that vaccine literacy among adults increases with higher education levels [32]. This is because higher education improves access to knowledge, health information-seeking behaviors, and the ability to evaluate, understand, and apply the information obtained. Thus, the link between socioeconomic status and health awareness is closely tied to education, as individuals with higher education are more likely to have a higher socioeconomic status [33].

Higher education attainment was positively associated with stronger self-efficacy [33], which aligns with HBM postulates identifying self-efficacy as a critical determinant of vaccination intention [34]. Our findings empirically validate this relationship: Group 1 (persistent vaccine awareness/high education) demonstrated both the highest self-efficacy scores (M= 4.30 ± 0.49) and the most favorable vaccination outcomes (current uptake: 74.52%; future demand: 73.24%).

Intergroup comparisons revealed stark contrasts in HBM dimensions between high (Group 1) and low (Group 4) vaccine awareness groups. Specifically, the high VA group scored significantly higher on perceived severity and perceived benefits, both recognized as facilitators of behavioral intention in the HBM. Conversely, the high VA group scored significantly lower on perceived barriers, which are known inhibitors of behavioral intention. These findings suggest that enhancing vaccination awareness may improve vaccination intentions by strengthening perceived severity and benefits while reducing perceived barriers.

Group 1 (persistent vaccine awareness) demonstrated strong positive associations with both current vaccination uptake and future vaccination intention, whereas Group 4 (persistently unaware) exhibited significant vaccine hesitancy. These results corroborate previous findings by He et al. [35,36] regarding awareness-behavior linkages. Importantly, our longitudinal design captured transitional awareness patterns, particularly Group 3’s negative-to-positive belief progression - highlighting the critical window for dynamic intervention delivery during awareness formation phases.

The vaccination intentions of different groups were influenced by distinct factors: Group 1 relied primarily on medical expert advice, Group 2 was driven by female gender and perceived benefits, Group 3 was positively influenced by advice from acquaintances, vaccine knowledge, and perceived benefits, but negatively impacted by social media misinformation, while Group 4 depended on government recommendations. These findings align with our previous research, which identified social cues as predictors of vaccination intent. However, this study further reveals that the positive effect of medical expert advice was most pronounced in Groups 1 and 2, groups characterized by higher VA during the early stages of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. This suggests that while expert recommendations universally enhance vaccination willingness, their impact is amplified among individuals with pre-existing vaccination awareness. These group-specific dynamics underscore the need for targeted interventions. For Group 2, whose VA declined over time, traditional media campaigns could effectively reinforce vaccine awareness [37], thereby reducing hesitancy. For Groups 1 and 3, disseminating scientific information through medical experts and relatives may strengthen social support. Notably, Group 3 exhibited HBM scores (e.g., self-efficacy: 4.17 ± 0.54 vs. Group 1’s 4.30 ± 0.49; perceived barriers: 1.99 ± 0.66 vs. 1.84 ± 0.57) comparable to Group 1, indicating that sustained VA during later pandemic phases is critical for maintaining vaccination intent and achieving herd immunity. For Group 4, government-led health campaigns are essential, consistent with Ward’s emphasis on institutional trust as a cornerstone for public health engagement [38].

Generalizability constraints: Despite baseline stratification aligned with census demographics, the longitudinal sample (n= 500) exhibited educational skew (93.4% with tertiary education), limiting applicability to populations with lower education. Furthermore, the study had a high attrition rate (cumulative retention rate of 27.5%), which may introduce selection bias. Future studies should employ region-stratified sampling to enhance representativeness.

Unobserved confounders: Key variables influencing vaccine awareness (e.g., political trust, religious affiliation) were unmeasured. For instance, Group 4’s weak response to government recommendations may reflect underlying institutional distrust.

Measurement reliability: Although the perceived benefits displayed a relatively low Cronbach’s alpha value (α = 0.639), this value may still be considered acceptable in certain contexts [39]. Therefore, we acknowledge the low internal consistency of this subscale as a limitation of this study. Future research will aim to further validate and refine the scale, considering the use of more standardized measures to enhance the reliability of the assessments.

For high-vaccination awareness groups (Groups 1 and 2), it is essential to strengthen communication channels with medical experts to maintain self-efficacy. This recommendation is empirically grounded in Group 1’s predominant reliance on expert advice, aligning with constructs of the health belief model where cues to action enhance behavioral intent. Implementation should include real-time teleconsultation platforms integrated into vaccination sites, enabling on-demand access to vaccinologists during decision-making. For Group 2, increased publicity regarding the protective benefits of the vaccine is necessary.

Regarding the fluctuating vaccination awareness group (Group 3), whose vaccination intent demonstrates significant vulnerability to social media, we advocate for collaboration with dominant platforms (e.g., official Douyin accounts for government affairs) to deploy AI-assisted fact-checking tools that automatically flag vaccine misinformation. Moreover, capitalize on the efficacy of advice from relatives/friends through structured community programs that train “health advocates” within personal circles. In addition, this group also requires increased knowledge of vaccines and awareness of their efficacy.

For individuals with persistent low vaccination awareness (Group 4), the vaccination process should be simplified. Data shows that despite baseline hesitancy, 48.15% of individuals are willing to get vaccinated according to government regulations, indicating the potential for policy leverage. Operationally, this means establishing one-stop mobile vaccination sites in underserved communities, extending vaccination hours, and providing home services to overcome geographic and time constraints, enhancing the public’s self-efficacy. Additionally, it is crucial to increase public awareness of the severity of COVID-19.

This study demonstrates that vaccination awareness states significantly influence vaccine hesitancy. The persistently aware group (Group 1) exhibited the strongest vaccination intention, whereas the persistently unaware group (Group 4) showed the highest hesitancy. Decision-making drivers varied substantially: Groups 1–2 relied on expert advice and required self-efficacy reinforcement; Group 4 responded to government guidance paired with severity messaging, while Group 3 was uniquely influenced by peer networks, and enhancing knowledge/benefits while reducing social media trust. These evidence-based distinctions suggest that stratified public health interventions—tailored to each group’s dominant behavioral drivers—could optimize vaccination coverage more effectively than uniform approaches.
