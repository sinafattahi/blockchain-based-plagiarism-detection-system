This study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Mini-Mental State Examination, 2nd Edition (MMSE-2), as a cognitive screening tool for patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) and vascular dementia (VD) in a Korean population. Specifically, we investigated whether the MMSE-2 effectively detects early cognitive changes associated with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) that might be overlooked by the original Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

A total of 66 patients with VaMCI, 46 patients with VD, and 75 cognitively healthy older adults participated in this study. All participants provided informed consent and underwent assessments using the MMSE-2, the original MMSE, and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.

The MMSE-2 demonstrated robust performance in differentiating participants across Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stages and CDR-Sum of Boxes scores. It exhibited excellent internal consistency, high test-retest reliability, and strong interrater reliability. Concurrent validity with the original MMSE and other neuropsychological measures was also high. The MMSE-2 showed relatively high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing normal cognitive aging, VaMCI, and VD.

The MMSE-2 is a valid and reliable tool for assessing cognitive impairment in patients with VCI in a Korean population. While its specificity in differentiating VaMCI from healthy aging remains relatively modest, the MMSE-2 demonstrates superior sensitivity in detecting VaMCI compared to the original MMSE. These findings suggest that the MMSE-2 is a valuable screening instrument for identifying early cognitive changes associated with VCI.

To address these limitations, the Mini-Mental State Examination, 2nd Edition (MMSE-2), was developed as a more sensitive and reliable cognitive screening tool.10The MMSE-2 introduces alternative equivalent forms (Red and Blue) to mitigate practice effects during repeated assessments, demonstrating high equivalency reliability (r= 0.96). Additionally, the MMSE-2 is offered in 3 distinct versions tailored to diverse clinical and research requirements: the Brief Version (MMSE-2:BV), the Standard Version (MMSE-2:SV), and the Expanded Version (MMSE-2:EV), each varying in length and scope to optimize cognitive evaluation across different contexts.

The Korean version of the MMSE-2, has been successfully translated and validated, demonstrating high reliability and sensitivity in distinguishing healthy older adults from individuals with MCI and AD.11Notably, its subtests targeting frontal lobe functions, including story memory and processing speed, suggest that the MMSE-2 may offer enhanced effectiveness in detecting cognitive decline associated with VCI compared to the original MMSE.

This study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of the MMSE-2, in assessing Korean patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) and VD. Specifically, it focuses on evaluating the efficacy of the MMSE-2 as a sensitive screening tool for identifying early cognitive changes associated with VCI, which are often overlooked by the original MMSE.

This study included participants aged 50 years and older, consisting of 66 patients diagnosed with VaMCI (36 males, 30 females) and 46 patients with VD (29 males, 17 females). These participants were recruited from the Clinical Neuroscience Center at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between November 2015 and March 2017. All participants underwent a comprehensive medical evaluation, which included a detailed clinical interview, neurological examination, blood tests, brain imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and neuropsychological assessments to ensure accurate diagnosis.

Furthermore, patients were classified as having VaMCI or VD based on their scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale13and the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB).14,15Specifically, VaMCI was defined by a CDR score of 0.5 and a CDR-SOB score ranging from 0.5 to 2.5, while VD was characterized by a CDR score ranging from 0.5 to 2 and a CDR-SOB score between 3.0 and 15.5.

Additionally, control participants scored above or within one standard deviation below the age- and education-adjusted norms on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE).7They also achieved an average score of 0.42 or lower on the Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) scale,17a threshold demonstrated to effectively differentiate dementia from normal aging.

The K-IADL is an 11-item assessment tool designed to evaluate instrumental daily functioning, including tasks such as shopping, transportation, financial management, housekeeping, food preparation, telephone use, medication management, memory, hobbies, television watching, and problem-solving. Control group participants demonstrated no cognitive deficits, as confirmed through comprehensive neuropsychological assessments administered using the same standardized protocols as those applied to the patient groups. The K-IADL is an 11-item assessment tool designed to evaluate instrumental daily functioning, including tasks such as shopping, transportation, financial management, housekeeping, food preparation, telephone use, medication management, memory, hobbies, television watching, and problem-solving. Control group participants demonstrated no cognitive deficits, as confirmed through comprehensive neuropsychological assessments administered using the same standardized protocols as those applied to the patient groups. All participants provided written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.

The MMSE-2, includes two alternative forms—the Red and Blue forms—designed to minimize potential learning effects associated with repeated administrations. Additionally, the MMSE-2 is available in 3 distinct versions tailored to different clinical and research needs: the MMSE-2:BV, the MMSE-2:SV, and the MMSE-2:EV. The nine subtests comprising the MMSE-2 are outlined below.

The MMSE-2:BV, with a maximum score of 16 points, consists of 4 subtests administered in the following order: registration (3 points), orientation to time (5 points), orientation to place (5 points), and recall (3 points). The MMSE-2:SV, with a total score of 30 points, comprises 7 subtests: attention and calculation (5 points), language (8 points), drawing (1 point), along with the 4 subtests included in the MMSE-2:BV. MMSE-2:EV, with a total score of 90 points, includes 9 subtests administered in the following order: story memory (25 points), processing speed (35 points), and the 7 subtests of the MMSE-2:SV.

The equivalence between the Red and Blue forms of the MMSE-2, was found to be high across all 3 versions: MMSE-2:BV (r= 0.90,P< 0.001), MMSE-2:SV (r= 0.97,P< 0.001), and MMSE-2:EV (r= 0.97,P< 0.001).11Based on these results, half of the participants in this study completed the Red form of the MMSE-2, while the other half completed the Blue form. The order in which the neuropsychological assessments were administered is summarized inTable 1.

MMSE-2 = Mini-Mental State Examination, 2nd Edition, SVLT = Seoul Verbal Learning Test, RCFT = Rey Complex Figure Test, SGDS = Short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale, K-TMT-E: Part A = Korean-Trail Making Test-Elderly’s version: Part A, K-TMT-E: Part B = Korean-Trail Making Test-Elderly’s version: Part B, SWF = Semantic Word Fluency, PWF = Phonemic Word Fluency, K-BNT = Korean-Boston Naming Test, DSC = Digit Symbol Coding, K-MMSE = Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.

An analysis of variance was performed to compare age and education levels across the three groups, while a χ2test was used to examine differences in gender distribution. Neuropsychological assessment results, including scores from the K-MMSE, were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with age, education, and gender included as covariates. Additionally, MMSE-2 scores across the three groups were analyzed using ANCOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons.

Reliability was assessed through internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability. Internal consistency of the MMSE-2, was evaluated using Cronbach’s α coefficient. Test-retest reliability was determined by re-administering the MMSE-2 to 11 patients with VaMCI, 5 patients with VD, and 4 healthy older adults approximately 1 to 2 months after the initial assessment (mean = 31.35 ± 7.53 days), with results analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Interrater reliability was measured by comparing scores assigned by 2 independent neuropsychologists (n = 32) using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

The validity of the MMSE-2, was evaluated through multiple analytical approaches. Concurrent validity was examined by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients between MMSE-2 scores and those from other neuropsychological assessments, including the K-MMSE, the SVLT, the copy task of the RCFT, the SWF-animal, the PWF, the K-TMT-E: Parts A & B, the DSC, and the K-BNT.

Discriminant validity, reflecting dementia severity, was assessed by categorizing participants into 5 groups based on their CDR and CDR-SOB scores. Differences in average MMSE-2 scores across these groups were analyzed using ANCOVA.

The diagnostic utility of the MMSE-2, was evaluated through ROC curve analysis to determine its sensitivity and specificity, with the AUC serving as an indicator of diagnostic accuracy. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), with the significance level set atP< 0.05.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Hospital for all participating sites (IRB approval No. B-1707-409-107). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the initiation of any study procedures. In cases where patients with VD exhibited impaired capacity to provide consent, written informed consent was secured from their caregivers on their behalf.

The demographic characteristics of the study participants are summarized inTable 2. A total of 187 older adults (94 men and 93 women) were included in the study. The mean age of patients with VaMCI was 71.97 ± 7.67 years (range: 54–91 years), while the mean age of patients with VD was 72.59 ± 7.35 years (range: 54–85 years). In the healthy control group, the mean age was 68.59 ± 7.10 years (range: 50–84 years).

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

VaMCI = vascular mild cognitive impairment, VD = vascular dementia.

The mean years of education were 11.06 ± 3.91 years (range: 6–20 years) for patients with VaMCI, 10.61 ± 3.62 years (range: 6–20 years) for patients with VD, and 12.31 ± 4.00 years (range: 6–20 years) for healthy older adults.

Significant differences were observed among the three groups in terms of gender distribution (χ2[1, 187] = 7.52,P= 0.023), age (F[2, 184] = 5.571,P= 0.004), and years of education (F[2, 184] = 3.246,P= 0.041). Tukey’s post-hoc analysis revealed that the mean age of patients with VD was significantly higher than that of healthy older adults, and the mean age of patients with VaMCI was also significantly higher than that of healthy older adults. However, no significant difference was observed between the mean ages of patients with VaMCI and those with VD.

Regarding years of education, healthy older adults had significantly more years of education compared to patients with VD. However, no significant differences were observed in years of education between patients with VaMCI and patients with VD, or between patients with VaMCI and healthy older adults.

In terms of gender distribution, the proportion of males and females in the healthy older adult group differed significantly from that in the VD group. However, no significant differences in gender distribution were observed between healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI, nor between patients with VaMCI and those with VD.

The results of the neuropsychological assessments were compared across the three groups (VaMCI, VD, and healthy older adults). Significant differences were observed among the groups across all assessed cognitive domains, including attention, verbal memory, visuospatial function, language function, and frontal/executive function (P< 0.001 for all domains).

Tukey's post-hoc analysis revealed that healthy older adults scored significantly higher than both patients with VaMCI and those with VD on the following assessments: K-MMSE, SVLT, copy task of the RCFT, K-TMT-E: Part B, SWF-animal, PWF, K-BNT, and DSC. Additionally, patients with VaMCI scored significantly higher than those with VD on these same measures.

In the K-TMT-E: Part A, no significant difference was observed between the scores of healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI. However, both groups scored significantly higher than patients with VD. Furthermore, no significant differences were found among the three groups in the SGDS scores. The mean scores for each subtest, along with the results of Tukey’s post-hoc analysis, are presented inTable 3.

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

Among the MMSE-2:BV subtests, the recall item exhibited the most pronounced differences across the groups. Healthy older adults scored significantly higher on recall compared to both patients with VaMCI and those with VD. Additionally, patients with VaMCI scored significantly higher than patients with VD on this subtest.

For the registration, orientation to time, and orientation to place items of the MMSE-2:BV, no significant differences were observed between healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI. However, scores on these items were significantly higher in both healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI compared to those with VD.

The MMSE-2:SV scores for the three groups are presented inTable 4. An ANCOVA, controlling for age, education, and gender, revealed significant differences among the groups on the MMSE-2:SV. Tukey’s post-hoc analysis showed that the total MMSE-2:SV score was significantly higher in healthy older adults compared to both patients with VaMCI and those with VD. Furthermore, patients with VaMCI scored significantly higher than patients with VD.

Among the MMSE-2:SV subtests, scores for recall, attention and calculation, and language were significantly higher in healthy older adults compared to both patients with VaMCI and those with VD. Additionally, patients with VaMCI scored significantly higher than patients with VD on these subtests.

In contrast, no significant differences were found between healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI on the subtests assessing registration, orientation to time, orientation to place, and drawing. However, scores on these four subtests were significantly higher in both healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI compared to those with VD.

The MMSE-2:EV scores for the three groups are presented inTable 4. An ANCOVA, controlling for age, education, and gender, revealed significant differences among the groups on the MMSE-2:EV. Tukey’s post-hoc analysis indicated that the total MMSE-2:EV score was significantly higher in healthy older adults compared to both patients with VaMCI and those with VD. Furthermore, patients with VaMCI scored significantly higher than patients with VD.

Among the MMSE-2:EV subtests, scores for recall, attention and calculation, language, story memory, and processing speed were significantly higher in healthy older adults compared to both patients with VaMCI and those with VD. Additionally, patients with VaMCI scored significantly higher than patients with VD on these 5 subtests.

In contrast, no significant differences were found between healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI on the subtests assessing registration, orientation to time, orientation to place, and drawing. However, scores on these four subtests were significantly higher in both healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI compared to those with VD.

The internal reliability (Cronbach’s α) of the 3 versions of the MMSE-2, including both Red and Blue forms, across the three groups is presented inTable 5. The internal reliability was found to be relatively high, with Cronbach’s α values ranging from 0.62 to 0.74.

Test-retest reliability was evaluated in 11 patients with VaMCI, 5 patients with VD, and 4 healthy older adults, who were assessed twice with an average interval of 31.35 ± 7.53 days. The participants had a mean age of 72.35 ± 7.13 years and an average of 11.60 ± 3.62 years of education. The test-retest reliability for the three versions of the MMSE-2 was found to be high, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.99 (Table 6).

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

Interrater reliability was assessed in 32 participants through independent evaluations conducted by 2 trained neuropsychologists during the administration of the MMSE-2. One-way, single-measure ICCs were calculated for each item of the MMSE-2 (Table 7), yielding ICC values ranging from 0.95 to 0.99. Notably, there was 100% agreement on specific items, including orientation to place, naming, repetition, comprehension, reading, writing, and drawing.

MMSE-2 = Mini-Mental State Examination, 2nd Edition, ICC = Intraclass correlation coefficient.

The concurrent validity of the MMSE-2 was evaluated by examining its correlations with other cognitive function tests, including the K-MMSE, SVLT, RCFT (copy task), SWF-animal, PWF, K-TMT-E: Parts A & B, DSC, and K-BNT. Significant correlations were observed across all 3 versions of the MMSE-2 with these cognitive assessments (Table 8). Specifically, strong correlation coefficients were found between the MMSE-2:BV and the K-MMSE (r= 0.865,P< 0.001), the MMSE-2:SV and the K-MMSE (r= 0.947,P< 0.001), and the MMSE-2:EV and the K-MMSE (r= 0.839,P< 0.001).

To evaluate the effectiveness of the MMSE-2 in assessing the severity of dementia, participants were reclassified into five distinct groups based on their scores from the CDR and the CDR-SOB.

The first group, comprising healthy older adults, was defined by a CDR score of 0 and a CDR-SOB score of 0, indicating no cognitive impairment. The second group included patients with VaMCI, characterized by a CDR score of 0.5 and a CDR-SOB score ranging from 0.5 to 2.5, reflecting very mild cognitive impairment. The third group consisted of patients with early-stage VD, who also had a CDR score of 0.5, but their CDR-SOB scores ranged from 3.0 to 4.0, suggesting more pronounced cognitive decline compared to the VaMCI group. The fourth group encompassed patients with mild-stage VD, defined by a CDR score of 1 and a CDR-SOB score ranging from 4.5 to 9.0, indicating MCI with functional decline. Finally, the fifth group included patients with moderate-stage VD, characterized by a CDR score of 2 and a CDR-SOB score ranging from 9.5 to 15.5, reflecting moderate cognitive impairment and substantial functional limitations.

Demographic information, including age, education level, and gender, was analyzed and is presented inTable 9. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in gender distribution (χ2[1, 187] = 8.679,P= 0.070) or years of education (F[4, 182] = 1.633,P= 0.168) across the 5 groups. However, there were significant differences in age (F[4, 182] = 3.426,P= 0.010), suggesting that age may be a contributing factor in group differences.

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

The MMSE-2 scores for participants across the five groups are presented inTable 10. An ANCOVA, controlling for age, revealed significant differences among the 5 groups across all three versions of the MMSE-2. Tukey’s post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant differences among the five groups for both the MMSE-2:BV and the MMSE-2:SV scores. For the MMSE-2:EV, significant differences were observed among 3 groups: healthy older adults, patients with VaMCI, and those with moderate-stage VD. However, no significant differences were found between patients with early-stage VD and those with mild-stage VD on the MMSE-2:EV.

The diagnostic utility of the three versions of the MMSE-2 was evaluated using ROC curve analysis, with the AUC serving as an indicator of diagnostic accuracy. The results for each version of the MMSE-2 are described in detail below.

For distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VaMCI, the AUC of the MMSE-2:BV was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71–0.86;P< 0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≤ 13 out of 16, the MMSE-2:BV demonstrated a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 58% for predicting VaMCI.

For distinguishing patients with VaMCI from those with VD, the AUC was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84–0.95;P< 0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≤ 11 out of 16, the MMSE-2:BV demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 72% for predicting VD.

For distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VD, the AUC was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97–1.00;P< 0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≤ 11 out of 16, the MMSE-2:BV demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 72% for predicting VD (Fig. 1).

First, for distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VaMCI, the AUC of the MMSE-2:SV was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81–0.92;P< 0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≤ 26 out of 30, the MMSE-2:SV demonstrated a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 80% for predicting VaMCI.

Second, for distinguishing patients with VaMCI from those with VD, the AUC of the MMSE-2:SV was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94–0.99;P< 0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≤ 23 out of 30, the MMSE-2:SV demonstrated a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 98% for predicting VD.

Finally, for distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VD, the AUC of the MMSE-2:SV was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99–1.00;P< 0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≤ 23 out of 30, the MMSE-2:SV demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98% for predicting VD (Fig. 2).

This study validated the newly developed MMSE-2 as a reliable and valid cognitive screening tool for assessing VaMCI and VD in a Korean population. The findings underscored several key points.

First, significant differences in MMSE-2 scores and other neuropsychological assessments were observed across the 3 groups (healthy older adults, VaMCI, and VD) across multiple cognitive domains, including attention, verbal memory, visuospatial function, language function, and frontal/executive function.

Second, the MMSE-2 demonstrated strong internal consistency, high test-retest reliability, and excellent inter-rater reliability, confirming its robustness and reliability as a psychometric assessment tool.

Third, the MMSE-2 demonstrated strong concurrent validity, showing high correlations with various validated neuropsychological assessments. Notably, the MMSE-2 exhibited a very high correlation with the K-MMSE and strong correlations with tests evaluating verbal memory, visuospatial function, language function, and executive function. These findings align with the results reported by Baek et al.11As previously noted, while the original MMSE includes assessments of executive function, such as attention and calculation, it is less sensitive to impairments in executive function, abstract reasoning, and visual perception/concentration.8However, as suggested by Folstein et al.,10the MMSE-2 addresses these limitations by offering a more comprehensive evaluation of executive functions, allowing for a broader assessment of cognitive domains compared to the original MMSE.

Fourth, MMSE-2 scores effectively differentiated between stages of cognitive impairment based on CDR and CDR-SOB scores. MMSE-2 scores demonstrated a significant decline as CDR and CDR-SOB scores increased, confirming its utility in distinguishing different stages of cognitive impairment. This finding suggests that the MMSE-2 is a valuable tool for monitoring the progression of cognitive decline.

However, no significant difference was observed in MMSE-2:EV scores between patients with early-stage VD and mild-stage VD. A possible explanation for this result is that the difficulty levels of the story memory and processing speed subtests may not be sufficient to differentiate between these 2 stages. Consequently, the MMSE-2:BV and MMSE-2:SV may offer greater sensitivity than the MMSE-2:EV in assessing cognitive functions in patients with early to mild stages of VD.

The sensitivity and specificity of the 3 versions of the MMSE-2 in distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VaMCI were evaluated. For the MMSE-2:BV, a cutoff score of 13/14 yielded a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 58%. For the MMSE-2:SV, a cutoff score of 26/27 resulted in a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 80%. For the MMSE-2:EV, a cutoff score of 44/45 demonstrated a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 82%. All three versions of the MMSE-2 exhibited comparable effectiveness in discriminating between healthy older adults and patients with VaMCI.

The sensitivity and specificity of the 3 versions of the MMSE-2 in differentiating patients with VaMCI from those with VD were evaluated. For the MMSE-2:BV, a cutoff score of 11/12 yielded a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 72%. For the MMSE-2:SV, a cutoff score of 23/24 resulted in a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 98%. For the MMSE-2:EV, a cutoff score of 33/34 demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 85%. All 3 versions of the MMSE-2 exhibited comparable effectiveness in distinguishing patients with VaMCI from those with VD.

Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of the three versions of the MMSE-2 in distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VD were assessed. For the MMSE-2:BV, a cutoff score of 11/12 yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 72%. For the MMSE-2:SV, a cutoff score of 22/23 demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89%. For the MMSE-2:EV, a cutoff score of 33/34 resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85%. All three versions of the MMSE-2 demonstrated comparable effectiveness in differentiating healthy older adults from patients with VD.

Overall, consistent with the findings of Baek et al.,11the MMSE-2 was shown to be a valuable screening tool for differentiating between patients with VaMCI and VD, as well as between healthy older adults and patients with VD. Additionally, the MMSE-2 demonstrated greater sensitivity in distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VCI compared to its ability to differentiate between healthy older adults and patients with MCI or AD. Specifically, the MMSE-2 was notably more sensitive in distinguishing healthy older adults from patients with VaMCI (84%) compared to MCI (60%), although the specificity for VaMCI remained relatively low (58%). The relatively low specificity of the MMSE-2:BV (58%) in distinguishing VaMCI from healthy older adults can be attributed to several factors. First, the cut-off score (≤ 13) was optimized to prioritize sensitivity over specificity, aiming to identify as many VaMCI patients as possible. This approach, while effective in detecting cases, may have inadvertently increased the rate of false positives among healthy older adults. Second, the MMSE-2:BV includes only four subtests—registration, time orientation, space orientation, and recall—which may not comprehensively capture the nuanced cognitive deficits associated with VaMCI. Third, VaMCI often presents with deficits in executive function and attention, domains that are not thoroughly assessed by the MMSE-2:BV. These factors collectively contribute to the relatively modest specificity observed.

In conclusion, the MMSE-2 represents a significant advancement over the original MMSE, offering enhanced sensitivity, broader cognitive domain coverage, and improved psychometric properties. Despite limitations in specificity, the MMSE-2 stands out as a versatile and reliable tool for the early detection, differentiation, and monitoring of cognitive impairment in patients with VaMCI and VD. Future research should explore domain-specific enhancements to further improve its diagnostic precision, particularly in the early stages of cognitive decline. This study reinforces the role of the MMSE-2 as an essential instrument in clinical and research settings, bridging critical gaps in the assessment of VCI.
